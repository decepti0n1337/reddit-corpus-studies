This is an alliance kicking out all of its inactives. Like turbo krabs and botters that didn’t rly do much. Content wise there’s less ppl docking up when I come into you constellation. I bet u or other ppl are doing fine just having to click d scan more like me when I’m ratting

Don’t worry they’ll just start outsourcing to China or India.

Dude I want to play wow and addicted to eve. It’s a good game. Sometimes I don’t feel like internet space shipping
---
show me a 300 bomber fleet. Normally its around 30-50.
---

---
"lol 300 corms will alpha muninns (and pretty much anything else besides supers). esp if they are dumb and dont hit their ADC"
---
I'm guessing the hecate is expextionally bad at pve and I should be running the confessor or one of the other ones instead?
---
Gay one sred?
---
youve obviously never seen the frat pings lmao
---
You've obviously never seen silly talk on the internet. Ya sweaty try hard.

"I said something thats completely wrong how dare you call me out on it"
---
ok
---
If you ain't cheating, you ain't trying. 
---
Just don't fuck your own side.
---
Jesus Christ are you serious? Is this your first day in /r/Eve?
---
Actually, i did some math.
---
A linked Muninn only recieved 307 alpha from a max pilot Manticore, shooting Scourge. Of the 2289 alpha that can hit, only 306.7 will actually hit. that is 39ish dps per manticore. It would take 189 manticores, max skilled, to 1 shot a muninn. That does not take into account the average skill of most bomber pilots.
---
If it is max tpd it would take 108 max skilled manticores to kill a muninn.
---
Max range of a stuka fit manticore is 60km.
---
it takes 10 muninns with Proton to 1 shot a Manticore from 85km. Mantis are fat, Proton has AMAZING tracking.
---
A fleet of  50 muninns would chew through manticores so quick it wouldnt matter.
---
However, please tell me how smart you are
---

Wow. It's hard for me to imagine how anyone would want to play a game on a tiny phone screen with awkward controls when they could do it on a desktop computer (or even console) made for the task.
---
Bhaalgorn is based on the Armageddon. :( At least the Cruor and Ashimmu are original.
---
I like fantasies. I happen to play a spaceship fantasy game created by Vikings that missed their true calling to pillage Euros in a longboat. So instead they made a game that was grindy enough to bring a nerdy spreadsheet spaceship guru to the same place as a drunk nerd that is too slow to be rly good at an FPS. Both spent too much time as a kid watching Star Wars/Star Trek depending on age group. Both are likely to agree on the same playstyle and both have been at the mercy of the devs the entire time.

So much this.

Here's the AAR I wrote up from Brave's POV
---
AAR: Req rorqs out mining 1 jump away from a drifter hole with bombers bar formed, they pinged for help with 3 rorqs tackled but stayed in req comms as we formed in brave comms/fleet. Communication was awful with the 2 separate comms and we were only able to get someone to relay when the rorqs had around 3 minutes left on cyno. At this time there was around 100~ bombers/kikis/booshers etc on field this was purely Bombers Bar at this point. We had incredibly bad cap numbers as in 2 carriers a HAW dread and 4 Faxes. We eventually managed to get up to 6 Faxes so Gwyn (love u bby its not ur fault this went to shit) called for those faxes to jump in to buy time whilst we get extra support. Jar jar starts to get help from TEST but they have to mid to get here. Around this time a 2nd stuka fleet was reported coming towards the fight from 68ft, another 100 or so people get on field shortly after and the rorqs and faxes die slowly but are able to buy enough time for TEST to jump in. TEST jump in shortly after the last fax dies and we merge fleets/comms and jump what we had ready in as well, in the ensuing hour another 200-300 extra stukas join the fight, PL, PH, FRT, Bombers Bar and TP. Due to the large number of booshers we weren't able to inflict significant losses on them as they could kite out our fighters quite easily. 
---
Communication is important, follow SOO and things go a lot smoother.

I didn't have to go back to square 1 - but *only* because I had a deer in headlights moment and prepared myself. I had been for a while doing hazardous things, and kept getting away from getting caught...
---
One day I suddenly realized if I lost my ship, I'd have to start over... So I bought a complete copy of my ship. On the very same day I'd finished doing that, I did a dumb thing, and ran a hauling contract to arton. My ship was not fit for doing lowsec hauls, let alone for getting over a dozen players dropped on it.
---
I died.
---
Within an hour, I'd gotten my spare ship out, and was hauling again, and immediately bought another complete spare copy of my ship as soon as I could afford it. I've always had a spare copy of the ship I'm primarily flying ever since - it's saved me quite a bit of trouble.
---
If you can't afford to lose it, you can't use it.
---
Jackdaw or confessor would be better for sure but 3s and 4s are very simple to run so you'll be fine with any active t3d. I believe It's something like lvl3 missions.
---
I do the same. The first rule of government spending,  why buy one when you can have two for twice the price.
---
I don't see the link between your answer and mine.

[them some rocky number you need to bump them up](https://i.imgur.com/VJaGeMz.png)

Yeah, because a downward trends that takes years and isn't at all related with aging game and playerbase has everything to do with a -5k peak in less than 2 months.
---
No
---
Jan to Jul doesn't help, Delve was in Tribute.
---
Good point. There are way less incursions runners than nullsec krabs, but it does count.
---
&gt; Local was a snap decision that didn't achieve the goal of getting rid of bots nearly as well as they thought it would
---
it did multiple things:
---
1) it significantly diminished bots in nullsec. any opinion to the contrary is wrong
---
2) it fixed the issues with local causing ratters to never be in actual danger
---
&gt;When the CEO of a company suddenly decides
---
local was loved by everyone except the most verbal and effected group in the game
---
as for the rest of the changes, i couldn't care less tbh, haven't played since then
---
Alpha VNIs did not affect the plex prices.
---
the wignspan guy disagrees with you
---
No shit.  One can be solo the other cannot
---
Very different mechanics to allow that
---
many activity before was semiafk players VNI or so. many players play with main and have other 2-3-4alts semiafk farming and these were very often catch be reds, because ppl hardly watch all accounts. but after blackout you do not need pve alts. so less ships in space, less activity, more dead null space, game fucked instead of supporting more activiity in space...
---
I used to do this in a set of Ishtars, was a good time.

Its why i called it the Carlos fit.

Hey man You see my littlle reference to you in the bottom left corner at the start of the vid

Out of all the fights I had only 1 pilot warped off when it was clear they were gonna lose.

Let's not get Serenity too excited yet.

Flextape cant fix that!

I'll be disappointed if it's no called the "How to skill yourself guide"
---
t3 give about a mil/isk a minute. from what I've seen. t4 give about 2-2.5 mil a minute, but the filaments cost a ton more. Once you can run t3 with ease, switch to t4. Don't expect to ever get space rich running them though.
---
Lol
---
I approve of this hobby, you should consider trying a stealth bomber with that 3pt scram instead since they have no targeting delay after decloaking.
---
Bait.
---
and?
---
alphas and vnis are irrelevant to the point i made.
---
the only reason people buy isk from RMTers is because it's cheaper than buying it from ccp. when in-game plex prices are high it puts a cap on what RMTers can charge for their isk - when plex prices are high it makes RMTing less profitable in irl currencies.
---
As someone who has a long history of highsec shenanigans, it most definitely would have an effect.
---
Damnit. I’m not even baked yet. Thanks Cal
---
lol if you think fleets are normally 30-50 you are high i can probably link you atleast 10 brs from this week with more than 50 stuka bombers
---
Made an attempt. Lolol.
---
Google SEAT, on mobile atm or id link it for you
---
I like it a lot. I've figured out some things for myself and was very happy about it. As far as playing on a phone the targeting and combat is fluid and not so many fingers pushing screens you cant see the game. Bought a BPC today too. First time in 15 years I may turn a profit on a T1!
---
Was a great class, was only there in a corm but hopefully in 2 months I will be out there again with a saber

Nah they're not going to use phones like this.  They're going to just use emulators on the PC.

EVE has an over-abundance of 1 kind of toxic person: The affluent "Let them eat cake!" type.  
---
"If you can't do X, just use some ISK and grab a few injectors to fix it."  
---
"What do you mean you can't fly a 1B Tengu with 3 on standby!?"  
---
Basically, there are people out there who cross the line from "Game" to "Work/Lifestyle", and have 500 accounts with billions in each, and seem absolutely dumbfounded that other people don't dualbox-grind C5 WHs for ISK with 2 marketplace-purchased characters. I'm not suggesting these folks are bad people... just -really- disconnected.  
---
I get it. Everyone, in theory, could follow the path of running an SP farm for uber-dank ISK, but that crosses my "Obsessive Person" threshold.   
---
There's a LOT of those people around now... and I find them as tiresome for their affluence as they tire of me for having market skills on the same character I shoot people with. How appalling :P
---
Author has a agenda, but hopefully a big brain can eli5 the impact highsec bots have on the game compared to high sec Indy dudes/carebears doing their usual thing.
---
Inb4 bots bad, no shit - but prove to me you aren't just upset over having more competition for you hs astroids/data sites.
---
Keep us updated.
---
How much they make and when they get banned.
---
I will.
---
By your own logic, how do you even know that it's genuinely "the left" that's even being toxic here on Reddit?  All those people might well be Republicans that are criticizing their own side of the aisle.
---
See, this is why I like you guys. You give good fights and have a good attitude towards Eve.
---
And by good fights I mean you'll fight even if it's not obvious that you'll win.
---
Thanks, so seat says I need a dedicated Linux server to install? Can I use my PC with a Linux mirror as the server or do I actually have to pay for a dedicated server?
---
Don't do that, don't give me hope.

I lack that knowledge, I had a Corp IT guy set it up on his home server.  I’m sure someone here knows.

not wrong
---
Well.. let's hear 'em
---
I know you can easily get the skills trained and what is in training through ESI, but don’t think you would be able to see what equipment they are using on ships with it. The corp I am in utilizes  a hosted site called Eve-hr.com for skill checks, etc. maybe it will suite your needs?
---
Is it not right there? 
---
&gt; Dropping 13% of our tank to solve a problem we don't have isn't very helpful.
---
Thanks for the bait btw.
---
Because we want the fights. Either we kill krabs or the group undocks to fight. Wormholers WANT fights and if we get caught it was because WE screwed up. Our eyes on the hole fell asleep, new sig spawned when we weren't paying attention, nobody was hitting D-scan and we didn't see the saber.
---
Unlike Null we don't blame others for our ratting losses, we own up and blame ourselves. Then reship to PvP and fight back... assuming we didn't get podded.  
---
Oh, you're talking about Null... It's because we want the fights. We figure we'd undock a fleet to fight, why won't null do anything but drop supers? Oh, right "deny them content" is the standard in Null. That's why I left nullsec for wormholes.
---
said practically every wormholer in the thread.
---
Funny how we all say it.
---
It's been a long time since played EVE what's going on here?
---
So is the Rabisu, but that's a limited edition ship, so...
---
Since 2017, I think. I just never saw the design process posted here so I figured you all might want a look.
---
I'll wait until they've dealt with the absolute *bear* of a legacy code issue CCP have been dealing with before I even consider complaining about not seeing these ships.
---
To be fair he might have grinded that cost out over time, and put together the fit piecemeal. When I first started out, I did that. I ground out missions and then got the free drake and the free raven and used those to continue missioning when I was a high sec mission runner. Just because the ship/fit/implants cost a lot, doesn't mean he spent it all at once.

"i did some math" whoa there buddy don't hurt yourself. I'm not going to try to debate with a neck beard on reddit about stupid shit because it's a waste of my time. But i will leave you with this, this exact scenario we are talking about has happened before, guess what the munins fed. I know it's hard for stupid people to appreciate but numbers in pyfa don't necessarily reflect what happens in a battle. There is a reason nobody uses phoenix as their first choice bomb dread even though they are best on pyfa.
---
Thanks for this AMA! Always looked at wormholes and decided I wanted to move to a high-class someday. My question is: Do you get corps that try and evict you, and if you do, how do you handle them? (I mean, 4 nestors are pretty op, but still not quite enough to take on a proper fleet)
---
MTA bots? Soul Wars bots? Etc etc, no more complicated than scanning a signature and playing minesweeper
---
You are certainly preparing them well for *EVE*.

make your own br
---
I mean, ships will still die. They'll just let you (the newbie) know why/how you died and what you can do better for next time.
---
Just run BlueStacks and stack those accounts!
---
Because at the moment a lot of krabbing in WH space is 100% risk free unless you are a drooling smoothbrain, for some of the best isk per hour in the game. Clear sites in rattles or nestors (mjd if new sig, cannot be caught unless retarded) clear drifters with an astrahaus (not even in space lmao).
---
I believe you should be at risk when making that kind of money, as do many others. This includes many of the people who abuse the above mechanics to print money risk free.
---
Worked once, right? v0v
---
*thinks of LDOE on Bluestacks*
---
Oh god the exploits you can do with that!
---
Anyone know where i should post if i want to sell a wormhole? is there a specific reddit for it
---
you have to be absolutely retarded to wanna krab in nullsec vs. the safety and reward of wormholes
---
I would take you seriously if you seemed like you knew what you were talking about.
---
Not if they never actually hit you. They can just target you from 10000 km away and slowly burn towards you forever.
---
After the casuals have all died after the cyno changes (I'm sure it will be exciting for a couple of weeks).  The careful player will no longer bother and will find a different way to earn isk, and then the hunters will be bored because there won't be anything left in space to gank.....  changes need to be made for sure, but right now nothing I have seen CCP present does anything for the game long term.  This idea has a lot of potential... but who knows?
---
so now everyone is shifting from "*CCP MUST DO SOMETHING ABOUT BOTS THEY ARE RUINING THE GAME*" to "*Botting is totally gucci in highsec*"
---
r/nocontext ?
---
iloveyou
---
boom goddem
---
Really? So give me a brief explanation of how you would go about writing a bot to automate the scanning process.  If you can even remotely get close to sounding like you know what you're talking about I might take what you say in to consideration.
---
Oh, try to explain the hacking as well.
---
&gt;Eve-hr.com
---
I'll look into this, thanks. I guess I can use zkill for the ship equipment issue.
---
Too bad only a retard actually believes that's the case, lmfao.
---
So, I am guessing this is no longer valid?  The link takes me to an error page, and the twitch website itself does not list eve anywhere under prime loot.
---
They've started multiboxing Reddit accounts to try to control the narrative since they think CCP gets it's guidance from Reddit. Look at the explosion of sock puppets there have been recently, all brigading on Goon Blackout whine threads.
---
Meh, half payouts in highsec if your Corp doesn’t have a structure.

Of course not. But when you dont ever have to travel to make dank ticks..

---
Just make sure they RMT assets before they get banned
---
That is absolutely wonderful.  I would suggest you turn it into a competition.  Whomever  scams the most before Christmas gets an extra gift or cash payout,  in order to keep it on the level, you should stipulate that drugging your sibling voids the agreement.
---
I've probably done 500 or so lvl5s in a Gila. Sadly, the more you do, the better the chances are you'll hit that one spawn you can't manage. The Nueters are your worst enemy for sure, they must die first. I once got a spawn with 10 neuting cruisers and barely made it out. It can be frustrating to have a ship that can manage 99.9% of the spawns, but there's that one that is brutally hard. If you got to lvl4s, there will be 4-5 vedmaks. From what I've noticed; the crusiers do way way more neuting (im sure someone's done the math) and they are your priority target, followed by frig neuters, then all webs. 
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/78392499/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78392499/) that's my fit for LVL5s; plus Mid-grade Chrystal implants, I get \~975 dps. 
---
Finally, if you only do Electricals, the buff basically ends the neuting threat, but they are expensive filaments. I'm to the point where I do all of them except Dark. I just switch out my rig to fit resist hole, and change drones.
---
First to fly to IR-FDV

Yea it’s actually not bad.  I can see where they are going with it.  It feels like eve just a few things need to be built out.  I hope no skill inj.

"Generally Speaking"
---
\- Sin = Most DPS or Neut Boat (Ok for Solo)
---
\- Panther = Most Flexible - Best when the drop goes sideways - great Disco Blops - IMO best "Solo"
---
\- Redeemer = Best "Fleet" Blops if there is such a thing...a complete brickhouse 120k ehp
---
\- Widow = Everyone says it crap.  They are wrong...maybe the best in the game if fitted properly.  We fly them all the time
---
&gt; People live in wormholes for the fights
---
That's why there are so many C6 brawls between Lazerhawks and Hard Knocks right.
---
There is no subreddit or really any tools for it that I know of. If you're part of a decent-sized wormhole corporation, then by asking around you may find individuals who are looking for a bear hole. You could try the Praise Bob discord, I guess?
---
What I'd probably do is rename my citadels to "for sale" and make sure the character I want a buyer to contact is in either the corp or the citadel's bio. If it isn't a highly desirable hole, I'd just start unanchoring and extracting things.
---
I don't doubt it. I'm living through a few corp members posting screenshots and memery about Echos, then I go back to emulators on my phone if I wanna play games heh.
---
As opposed to the VNI before which needed PLEX?
---
&gt;If you don't like the full eve, you won't like this.
---
So what you are saying is this entire subreddit will hate it
---
The Springs, or Carson?
---
Ya.
---
No, when using any other ship I do not witness this effect. Just one particular ship had this problem.
---
ok Big Butt Turd Burglar.
---
How precisely are you running 1000 fucking eve accounts at once
---
Just spend the thousands of dollars on hardware and electricity on PLEX instead and save yourself a massive fucking headache
---
Should be able to solo it easily. I used both a paladin and a golem to run sanctums in null sec. Had some difficulty with the 10/10 escalations until you removed some of the incoming dps. First few seconds could be scary.
---
Isk making in botting regions is down, and down by a LOT. The numbers don't lie, nullsec botting is a most 5% of what it used to be. Bots just aren't finding solutions that can keep them active and not dead. 
---
That leaves Highsec, where bots simply can't make even a tenth of what they used to because AFK activities in highsec are purposefully garbage for income. The best they can manage is T3 abyss bots, which if even a small portion of botters switch to will result in depressed values for the products, and then those bots aren't good either. 
---
No matter how you want to twist it in terms of the overall health of the game, it is unequivocally clear that blackout has done more to combat botting that many of CCP's previous efforts combined.
---
SEADC is just a shitty newbro corp that accepts anyone with a pulse. Nothing particularly special about them.

20k other dudes? When was the last time there were 20k actual players actively playing in one alliance? You mean chars! And if you go by chars, he is not living there Solo.
---
And this guy managed to live there for 5 weeks...I bet you could live in Null for 5 weeks solo before getting evicted. Or way longer if it is NPC null and you don´t set up citadels. We are not talking about keeping SOV. And if he gets evicted, he loses everything in that hole!
---
Do you think he could actually defend this hole against a coordinated group that wants to evict him? No chance!
---
The only reason he is still there is because he either went under the radar of the big groups or noone is interested in that hole yet.

Not OP but I have a C5 Krabhole with my alts exactly the same as OPs. You have two routes you could go, You can make decent isk if you want to ninja huff gas sites and warp out when the rats spawn in C5 gas sites (vital core and instrumentals are the ones you want). If you want to run data and relic you can check out C1-C3 sites and do the pirate spawns. The rest spawn rats and you aren't generally worth it. Now if you want to strictly run sites solo then you want a C3. There is a praxis fit if you want to go cheap but it can be slow. If you want to go ultimate krab mode then you want a rattlesnake.

as someone not familer with capital mechanics, can you please explain why?

I thought at one point I read the companies that do this do it for a reason.  Maybe some unique hardware that can't be spoofed, or perhaps each one needs its own line thats unspoofable on EMU?   Can't recall, but maybe I'm wrong.

How much does an Alpha Venture mining highsec ores make? Like 2mill/h? That doesnt seem to be worth the effort when you compare it to the 60mill/h of VNI bots in null. Also, the amount of ore in highsec is limited, there are no giant ore anomalies.
---
You don't seem to understand the level of scaling botting groups can engage in nor do you seem to really understand the economics around it. Also lol @ your 5% statistic you just pulled out of your ass - there are still numerous Gila and super bots in space. Enjoy your bubble of ignorance though friend!
---
I mean I thought I put it in laments terms as easy to understand as possible... do I need to crayon draw and image for you to understand?
---
Show me the MER numbers then. They quite literally show us how much botting is going on from groups that are known botting groups like GOTG pets, Iron Crown, and other rental groups.
---
Because them MER numbers I see are all waaaaay down for the big botting boys.

Choo choo! Love that little guy.  Nice job baiting.

Is there a way to access EVE-hr while only providing a limited ESI? I mainly want to see skills and skill que. I am uncomfortable providing in game mail ESI and don't want to require that of my corp members either.
---
Modified stripped client that's just a bot interface sending packets to the server.
---
i tried searching for em but I couldnt fidn em , could you link me to all 3?
---
:(
---
what is your setup for doing the drifter, besides the bb?
---
The population has been dropping since 2013.
---
So more often than half of wspace, nice
---
They aren't the new hk. What an odd phrase
---
Are the Echoes mechanics compatible with EVE or they are totally different games?
---
I do have a nemesis I was hoping to go to bombers bar(that still a thing?)
---
How many alts does your """solo""" life involve?
---
I wish this would be the mobile EVE client we all wanted, but it seems it's a different game altogether :/
---
Side note, if Echoes' controls and menus are simple and manageable for mobile, maybe the same concept can be used to redesign PC EVE's interface? EVE menus are always the first thing to scare people off this game...
---
They're

&gt; So there we go boys, a third person shooter EVE action MMORPG with character abilities
---
EVE MOBA my dude
---
MMMOBA
---
Now they are swimming in PA's cash they have the audacity to waste it all again.
---
Jokes aside, EVE is a game on decline and there are very little they can do to change its nature. They might be able to revitalise the game but it wouldn't bring in many new players anyway. Eventually, they will have to diversify into other products linked with the EVE IP to make them more appealing to the general public.
---
Oh hey bud
---
Sure, make the systems feel even more empty than they do now
---
Ah ok. Thanks
---
That hasn't been my experience, but I believe you. 
---
That's what makes OP's question so difficult to answer. There are so many possible interaction experiences that there can't be a single answer other than "yes, but actually no".
---
He has a point.
---
&gt;But hardcore in Eve only seems to go one way, easier for small gangs and harder for big gangs. 
---
Roaming coalition space in small ships with no backup has never been easy, before or after blackout.  
---
&gt;Small "elite" gangs are basically leeches that live off the work of others.
---
It's a game, bud. Granted, it is a game with a lot of alienated libertarian-capitalism fetishists, but still, I recommend you save complaining about welfare queens for your call-ins to Rush.
---
Sir Issac "Deadliest SOB in Space" Newton strikes again.
---
Thank you.
---
Locust fleet is r64 r32 moons exclusively. Each rorq pulls over a billion typically.
---
Sounds like 3. Solo means 1 person doing everything. Alts, like ships, are tools. Don’t get hung up on having to use a couple to do a job.
---
This is what EVE players actually believe.
---
&gt; laments terms
---
Think you need to look that one up, friend.
---
Top quality argumentation. Thanks for chatting I learned a lot from your awesome ideas. Maybe you should go play minecraft or some other game if you take this so hard.
---
Haha. Good man =)
---
Haha good man! =)
---
Not pve nullbears either btw
---
Obviously the headline is fucking retarded, they’re just going to try to help newbros understand how and why they lost a ship and what to do better in the future
---
my boss just asked me if everything is alright, he was hearing muffled laughing noises around my desk, couldn't hide my grin, good lord i am happy it's still morning so i could say it was just "some funny news story" to my coffee
---
Pirate dreads cost a ton. A Chemosh hull costs the same as an Avatar, but it's nowhere near as powerful or tanky, or able to receive reps while sieged.
---
They're totally different games--played in different universes, but the mechanics are (so far) very similar.
---
If players value winning more than playing this will always be the result. CCPs obligation was to make playing more fun than just all out winning.
---
Ive been seeing a doctor about my potty mouth.
---
HSM V or Acceleration control V?
---
You get butthurt much? Lol go play wow
---
No, not like I spent 2 years in wormholes, 3 months in Null couldn't possibly have shown me what that was like either.
---
Sure, I'm not an expert... But I'm pretty sure I know more about Null than you do about Wormholes.
---
Providence is the only Null region where people don't shoot on sight. Unless your current corp (or, if NPC corp, most recent player corp) has been shooting at Providence residents in the past. Then, the alliance gets added to the Kill On Sight list.
---
There are a few alliances which have agreed to hold all of the sov in there and enforce a "don't just kill everyone like the other sov places" agreement, the largest being CVA. The two nearby coalitions, Imperium and Legacy, don't generally try to take over since the ProviBloc people just sitting there and minding their own business is a good buffer zone. Pandemic has tried to take over on occasion (has succeeded, but CVA has a long tradition of being kicked out and then resituating themselves back as the rulers of Providence). One alliance in Legacy, Tactical Supremacy, does want to expand into Providence (and, according to a big name in CVA, shoots other Legacy members and other blues when Provi batphones them). And a lot of people go there to just shoot people since they're less likely to boson you than other regions with similar levels of activity such as Delve. Spectre is one of those, has recently gotten into a campaign that's a bit more political than NPSI should be (although it certainly is fun to go around and shoot a lot of people, and Cerberus response fleets certainly are more fun than supercapital response fleets), the CVA big name guy who I mentioned basically framed Spectre's Provi campaign as Providence being like Israel, Pandemic being like Iran, and Spectre being a bunch of people who do really bad things on behalf of Iran while thinking that they are a noble cause.
---
E-Uni had had that aforementioned CVA big-name guy in as a guest lecture a few weeks ago. Useful information, but one of the most important things that you have to consider for all of SovNull is that most of what the big names say is propaganda.

Your narrative is sinking about as fast as the EVE player base.
---
Sweet, that's about what I want to do, I got a case and power supply already, DDR prices keep going down and I'll try getting the CPU/APU, mobo, and RAM around black friday or something.
---
It is on the decline. Because these mega coalitions are too large. When your coalition is greater in numbers than the average online number. The game is over
---
3man T5 multiboxing is a bil an hour. Next to marketing, it’s easily the best money in game. Maybe tied with dread ratting in C6s.
---
Judging by the replies I'd say, the reddit is toxic.
---
Which narrative, that some people are having fun playing eve right now?  Sorry thats not you but its not a 'narrative' when there are a LOT of us having fun.
---
I honestly dont care if those of you that aren't having fun leave, I'd rather see the game die off than limp on like it was.
---
"it significantly diminished bots in nullsec."
---
removing bots from nullsec is meaningless if you don't remove their ability to re-establish themselves in highsec.
---
" it fixed the issues with local causing ratters to never be in actual danger "  
---
Ratters have never "not been in danger"  stupid people died in delve all the time.
---
" local was loved by everyone except the most verbal and effected group in the game "   
---
Being loud and obnoxious on reddit does not make you meaningful or useful to the rest of the player-base.
---
Carriers are really isk efficient when insured. Supers not so much, but still yes before a fight.
---
I multi box hawks in T5s and it’s actually really easy.
---
Meme-sis

*urself
---
Also matches with many places starting school.
---
How is the August September area normally?
---
It is solo, the voices in your head don't count as people
---
its cute with the bee pets argue among each other
---
also I fucking miss the days when titans and supers mean something
---
not its just used by line members to spew garbage on reddit about how many rorquals/supers/titans they killed without any content
---
Not any ship, just covert ships and Titans.
---
This was before the modules had hard coded hull restrictions. Instead the covert cloak had rediculous fitting requirements and covert ships were given an extreme reduction in fitting for the items.
---
But you could get the avatar to have enough fitting to fit the doomsday the cloak and some other basic mods.
---
And yes, it was on TQ as well.
---
I wanna hang out in noob systems and just gank every new guy I see just to overflow that stupid idea.
---
Then I have no idea what you're doing in this conversation. Are we not talking about blackout?
---
Burn them all! Including this server!   
---
[https://i.imgur.com/oUaY8nj.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/oUaY8nj.jpg)
---
What?
---
Part of the point is that you may have to break a few eggs to make an omelette.
---
But i thought CCP is grr nullblocs
---
Nah, order it by "Best Selling" that way you know what you should buy too!
---
It's mainly that emulators are kind of shit and take more power than the phones do.
---
Can they help me with my crippling depression?
---
Not likely.
---
Arm processors are way lower great and energy costs, and the PC's will likely be on Intel predecessors.
---
I've definitely heard stories of people living in sov null for extended periods of time in the less active areas of null a few years ago. The dronelands especially because it was usually pretty empty and you could to days or weeks without being noticed if the system wasn't being ratted regularly.
---
minefieldssssss
---
Please, tell me more about your objective morality.
---
I mean you have to give some credit for sheer refusal to admit the facts
---
Yes
---
Go and serve in FW for a couple of weeks and then try again.
---
You go play minecraft first
---
More CO players keep popping up...
---
Well, at least in other cases they don't you a double space after a sentence. That would make me want to rage quit.
---
Yes, but since CCP brilliant ideas , well ... the death  cliff became real
---
A solo rattlesnake in a c3 makes very good money. Most of the fits cost a bit over a bil and you make the money back in a few hours tops. Lot of groups want scanning alts but most wormhole corps are recruit starved enough to not really care. Marauder ratting in C4 is also ok money. C4 and below works fine as a solo player if you're with a decent corp tbh.
---
Shhh. Lowsec is great without everyone invading my space!
---
Small gang that is roaming cloaky/nullified (basically no risk pvp) is not a lot of people having fun. It's a few risk adverse pvp'er afraid to commit anything. It's pretty boring in terms of a play style. And I would consider masses of people (almost half the player-base of last year) the game limping and dying off because of these changes. And as a person who primarily does pvp, less people in space is less targets for me to hunt.
---
This is commonly accepted term in EVE. It's you trying to attach a different meaning to it.
---
&gt; removing bots from nullsec is meaningless if you don't remove their ability to re-establish themselves in highsec.
---
wrong!
---
&gt;Ratters have never "not been in danger" stupid people died in delve all the time.
---
muh 1% of 1% ratters die so it must be balanced knowing whenever hostiles were nearby :)
---
&gt;Being loud and obnoxious on reddit does not make you meaningful or useful to the rest of the player-base.
---
ironic
---
There was this guy who was basically living in Deklein (when Goons were there) doing sites and shit. Not sure how long did it last, but no less than a month.
---
About five years ago this was not what people meant when they said "solo".
---
As far as I'm aware most of the guys that were living nomadic out in the drones were living out of carriers. I'd imagine most of them have died out or changed activities with it being less profitable in recent years.
---
* claps* you are pants on head retarded
---
and I'm only responsible for like half of that.
---
&gt; Angel dread will be useless.
---
I dunno, with Angels theme of mobility, serious reduction of Siege cycle is not unthinkable, and it can be interesting.
---
I dont get it
---
What do you want to say with this?
---
Thank you! The idea is indeed to create more content for all of us :)
---
He hasn't logged in his 8 rorchal mining alts since blackout and thinks CCP cares
---
Downloaded it and have already concluded that the game is dying.

The dreadnought is litteraly the hull of a machariel put verticaly with a cynabal sticked to its rear lmao.

---
Yeah how does it feel to have 12.6k players online all at once and a big group of those will be paying for their service.............. oh
---
The only people not playing anymore didn't deserve to be playing in the first place. They were botters and afk ratters/miners. Play with the risk.
---
Probably took this right after DT
---
Well that depends on your definition of toxic. I would assume toxicity is defined as unnecessary behavior by one person towards another person or persons that generates negative emotions and experiences for those people.
---
Under that definition things in league of legends like inting, other types of grefing and flaming are toxic and many behaviors in eve are as well.
---
What makes this tricky though is that the environment is much different and the attitudes of the people are much different.
---
As for the environment; league is a moba while eve is a mmorpg. Completely different genres where you do different things as players. League is marketed as "fun time with friends, be competitive if you want to". Eve is marketed as "cold harsh space sci-fi, remember to pack lube you will get assfucked a lot, and watch your back; the next knife is coming". You see this in eve slogans/lines like "the most important ship is the friend-ship", "remember the most valuable thing in eve is trust" and "HTFU". Eve players echo this attitude. Some truly believe it while those who don't either can't stand the environment and leave or they stay quiet because they know if they speak they will be told to leave of be quiet by everyone else.
---
Players who are seen as toxic in league are seen as bad people. There are people complaining all the time about how toxic the game is because they got flamed or inted. People constantly complain about toxic streamers, saying streamers like tyler1, IWD, SRO, NB3 etc. should be banned from streaming or whatever because they give toxic players validation and role models. At the same time positive streamers are held up as the gold standard that everyone should strive to meet.
---
But in eve it's different. You scammed a few bill off someone? Wow nice one! You stole all your corp's assets and left? Haha that's awesome this is what eve is all about! You joined a corp, played there for months, but really you were just gathering intel for a wardec? Damn I wish I had your balls and dedication! You backstabbed the alliance you were a director of, stole everything you could and joined the other side? Holy fuck that's cool only in eve can amazing shit like this happen!
---
Are these behaviors toxic? Under the league definition yes, certainly. Under some other definition? Maybe not.
---
they don't care at this moment. my sub is still running but i'm one of those people that is not logging on anymore. So i don't show up yet on their bottom line.
---
Yeah vale, sorry.
---
You know the moment someone code in to check for those rats on grid ... stuff will dock or relocate nearby.
---
Judging by that screenshot, I would guess it feels ok.
---
That’s great but the way that was written made me go ‘wha?”
---
No input automation, no real money transfer.
---
I can't speak for the OP, but those were the numbers I saw a few minutes ago when I installed Eve on my new lappy.
---
Or give 20kSP to the killer if he does a proper follow up convo with the noob. Win win.
---
Do you guys not have phones?
---
I'm just curious what the hell they are hauling.
---
EvE iZ dYiNg
---
&gt; Once i managed to bump one of those freighers 200km back to 4-4 undock, into structure itself in a way the ship was constantly bumping itself from the station unable to dock and the freighter was sitting there until i logged out, trying to warp to Perimeter for 2 straight hours.
---
haha nice, gj
---
They care more about him then your empty shell.
---
&gt; he only people not playing anymore didn't deserve to be playing in the first place.
---
Holy Fuck that is the most toxic mentality I've ever seen, that someone needs to be DESERVING to play a GAME.
---
&gt; They were botters
---
Statistics have proved over and over again that they haven't quit, just moved to high sec.
---
&gt; and afk ratters/miners.
---
Easy Kill for hunters, I don't see the issue.
---
But I saw a bot/afker today so that means that none of the players that left were bots/afkers. Checkmate, atheists.
---
This happened to me. I lost my mining ship because, well I got a bit complacent.
---
All of a sudden a msg from support popped up and told me how sorry they were for my loss, and here is your ship back. I had already bought a new one, but it was a nice surprise.
---
Won't really make a difference, though, because when all you hear is how the game is dying and people leaving, and a huge percentage of the accounts are bots, well who wants to invest a lot of time into learning to play a twitching corpse.
---
It's actually more straightforward than appears at first glance. 
---
If your definition of moral behavior is something like the commonly understood "conducting oneself in a way that minimizes harm to yourself and others, and maximizing the well-being of yourself and others", then one can make objective claims about a set of actions being moral or immoral. Of course, no one has perfect knowledge and so mistakes are still made while attempting to do this and sometimes moral actions lead to unintended consequences.
---
If that's not what you're talking about then it's really just a symantics game and I can just say "that's the definition I use when i discuss whether and action is moral or immoral, despite whatever definition you may have for it"
---
Either way, teaching children to take advantage of other people in a way that harms them and benefits themselves is clearly immoral based on my previously stated definition.
---
[4 hours till DT, Get your feels out of the way](https://i.imgur.com/SszFEMD.png)
---
I haul, alot...with a number of hauling toons. I also know others with similar setups. There are times where the value of the cargo is so low  or theyre emoty that autopiloting is an option. 
---
I have come back to my computer after going to the gym and had all but one at the destination... maybe it was me you bumped?
---
They're not really spread out over those four regions, they're almost all in Delve, as that's where the umbrella is. I was being generous saying that Fountain was used. Fountain has an umbrella, but it's not where the majority of activity is for the Imperium. 
---
Period Basis is mostly renters, and Querious, other than fake Querious, is mostly QFC.
---
Goons go all over Eve, sure, but when they're multiboxing rorqs or super/titan ratting, they're probably not doing it in Malpais.
---
6h after log they'd actually finish burning 10k km and start hitting
---
No.
---
For me the test of EVE has been: who can lose his boat and not give a fuck and still come back.
---
I got into EVE, I was mesmerised by the pretty. So, once I figured out how you could make that thing go -&gt; that way, I jumped through gates. One gate has a box that says “it’s dangerous beyond this gate. Are you sure you want to jump?” I go: yeah yeah, whatever. I jump through, nothing happens. “this is what I’m supposed to be nervous about?” I jump to the far end of the system. There he is: his name goes blinky red... that can’t be good. My boat starts to shake, there’s loud noises. Now I’m in an egg. *how the fuck am I in an egg?!?*. More shaking, more loud noises. Now I’m in a station. I have no idea what was going on. I was green as grass I knew absolutely nothing about EVE. I thought: this joint is one hell of a wild ride. Been there since.
---
I understand a lot of people can’t handle that. I’ve lost many ships since then. I don’t give a rat’s ass. There’s always more ships.
---
How do I do that on a phone that doesn't have the Format as external option?
---
Actually, when you take hull damage, you have a small chance for your modules to take heat damage.
---
Carriers, definitely. If you fly cheaply, the insurance can payout nearly half of the ship value.
---
"wrong!"
---
Not wrong!
---
" muh 1% of 1% ratters die so it must be balanced knowing whenever hostiles were nearby :) "  
---
Did this make sense to you when you posted it? Because it seems to be missing a few words.
---
" ironic "
---
It's not ironic its sad, the people cheering on these changes seem to think that shouting down any one who disagrees makes them right, it doesn't it just makes them look ignorant.
---
CCPlz when can i get my pokemon-like dread ?
---
I want my emotional support fedo.
---
You misunderstand, morality is itself subjective, so while you've given your definition from which you can derive objective statements this is only true under that definition. 
---
So sure, what you say is correct until someone else says their view of morality differs and your entire point is moot. What if I decide that the benefit outweighs the harm? I can then argue scamming others is okay. 
---
p.s. I don't necessarily disagree with the guy I replied to nor agree that OP is a cool guy whose justified in his behaviour I just disagree with the idea of both objective or "common" morality.
---
was it ever argued as such? people got to kill 2 Vanquishers in 1 month, its supposed to be fun honey
---
Yeah, it's not as if people are outside your house blowing up your rl car, after all.
---
But the general negativity in the player base is a little offputting. Game is dead, it's all bots, CCP don't care etc.
---
someone asset mined such a structre from the game so it will probably happen
---
$20 op uses a bumping bot to bot bump the freighter bots
---
If you think a business cares about your solo cloaky frigate ass more than someone who gives them $200/month in accounts
---
Man i got some news for you
---
You are one of the things wrong with this game and anyone who upvoted him. Bots can go to hell but saying someone doesn't deserve to play a video game just cause they don't play how you want them to is just ignorant.
---
You seriously need to step back if you believe this
---
But i’m sure you’re a troll.  Nobody is THIS dumb
---
&gt; Small gang that is roaming cloaky/nullified
---
Lol no bro, everybody having fun isn't doing that, some people are, the rest of us are out in non nullified non cloaking ships. 
---
https://zkillboard.com/corporation/116777001/
---
Weird, look at that, top 4 ships are non cloaking, in fact the only ship on that list that fits that description is the Loki and its not fit in that manner.
---
Like sorry theres a database that shows you to be a retard but if they quit I 100% do not give a rats ass, the game burning to the ground is a better option than what we had going on.
---
This is why blackout has been great. To make players like you quit.
---
Cant take my desktop or console with me to work of which there is a shit load of downtime.
---
&gt;the people cheering on these changes seem to think that shouting down any one who disagrees makes them right, it doesn't it just makes them look ignorant.
---
what you see doesn't exist
---
s a l t y
---
As long as you keep putting a distracting waifu to the corner, you will keep getting my views.
---
Keep it up !
---
Electricity is also obviously free.
---
If i see 3 freighters moving from same corp and i manage to bump one to a station where it is stuck in warp for hours while others come back and go for another trip then for me this is a bot.
---
I appreciate the reply.  So why is the Widow good? Also if I do finish Redeemer is that viable for some solo play as well or it it just basically like Sin strictly. Also still tengu for hunting ship? Again thank you.
---
That item has been in the game files for a LONG time though.
---
They are mostly hauling to Jita and moving out from trade hub empty.      I seen many DST haulers also moving all the time but you cannot bump this.
---
Why would someone want to camp a B274 hole? 
---
(Asking for a newish to exploration friend who has in casual conversation mentioned he has been in a few B274 holes of late. I'll try to see if he can get me the info on where they were at.)
---
Thanks for the reply! I bought this fit &amp; implants over saving money for Omega in terms of faster skill learning. I mean my plan is to wait until I get 5kk SP (cap for alphas as I know) and then upgrade to Omega. Lest do some math. You get like 25k base SP per day, doubled with Omega, but alpha can buy daily alpha injector every day and get 25k base + 50k from injector that's +25k SP more every day than Omega and 30 alpha injectors and 1 month of Omega costs basically the same ~1.7 bil. If i am wrong - correct me
---
Yeah..but like...WHAT?!?
---
There is very little that is truly profitable to haul, and even having that kind of volume seems impossible
---
Just give each other a reach around - you both obviously have pent up sexual tension!
---
Multiboxing autopilot maybe?
---
It's a joke.
---
People think the Corp of my flair just camps holes from low class to highsec.
---
There is no point in camping them since people can just jump back to highsec.
---
what about the 500mn hictor changes?
---
How so? Do you discuss objective morality just before your daily powerwank to pictures of your sisters feet?
---
So he has finally got rid of a little tinfoil atleast...
---
...You do realize SEADC has basically always been a HS basecamp since they regrouped end of last year right. "I have spoken to their CEO/alliance head a number of times and something's not right about them" Sounds like a line out of the trump handbook. 0 context or valuable information.  
---
Also.... I dont really see the benefit. Usually people do mean stuff thanks to some backthought, right? Isk, or someshit. If you had any idea how SEADC works, you would know that there is  no way to make huge amounts of money off this.  
---
As a returner to this game and a complete newbro to anything but mining, joining SEADC around 9 months ago was the best choice of my EVE life. Competent people teaching you the basics of PVP (and also the more advanced stuff like scouting, hunting, probing, FCing if you are interested in that), a friendly environment, services set up for your convenience, a chatroom for any kind of topic you could think off... There's little left to be desired at all. Atleast from my standpoint.
---
Jesus Christ, I'm facepalming, but at the same time I honestly wonder why I expected anything less.
---
Probably, but 8 rorq gave more content then cloaky afk neckbeard.
---
Feels like any small game after classic release. Eve iz dying
---
No sorry, rorqual proliferation is caused by the same cause.
---
I think that excavators are one of the best ideas by CCP to be honest.
---
In its previous role a rorqual was almost useless, closed in its pos to give bonuses.
---
Change its role to an active one made possible to enjoy industry and mining also to those players who don't have a lot of accounts, it was a change that added new opportunities for players, and this is always a good change imho.
---
It helped also pvp because it moved a juicy target from a safe position to a more risky, and in fact rorquals are now the primary target for pvp, and we have so many examples to rorqual fights scaled up to capitals and super, even titans.
---
This just means that the null-sec CSM conspiracy is working as intended.
---
Wow the salt in you is strong. How many rorquals did you lose so far? Or if you're just a baddie how many subcap ratting ships? Hope I find you in one of my roams although I probably already have :) (inb4 I'm not playing anymore unsubbed my 125 accounts but im still shitposting on reddit because im braindead)
---
Thanks for your answer! Yeah I know that t4 will be much harder than t3 and isk/hour increase isn't insane. But as I said in post I can easily do every spawn of t3 except these 2 rare spawns which are very hard, but doable if I'll manage everything without mistakes and overcharge modules.  But time to farm out isk for one more fit in t4 is 2-2.5 times faster compared to t3 so maybe the risk worth it?
---
In before he joins gsf
---
That escalated nicely :D
---
:)
---
dosnt he already live in delve with lots of his alts?
---
Ok now i am really worried.     
---
u/olmeca_gold serious question if this is not under NDA for some reason (but as this is your opinion i guess no) .

After the CSM summit and talking with other CSM members what is your opinion now about :             
---
* blackout           
---
* cyno changes       
---
* the CCP Chaos era            
---
Maybe simpler - have your stance on any of those changed when you talked with other CSM members.

I think it really just has to do with the most popular phones are the ones they're letting in.  While the A50 does have similar specs it uses a completely different SOC than other samsung phones.  So by limiting it to the mainline they can rule out bugs being caused by the micro code in your particular CPU.

Eviction in wormholes usually happens for 2 reasons:
---
1. You're a huge space dick and you pissed people off
---
2. You have a loot pinata that pays peoples effort to camp your hole for multiple days
---
Most PVP corporations prefer some more instant content. Role a few holes, fly around null, scout the chain for activity and collect intel on how to kill them. Doing an eviction requires a lot of preparation. You need to get some scouts in and collect some intel. Then you need to move in a decent fleet. A Fortizar can deal some nice damage, so you'll need a few good logi pilots and some strong DPS. 
---
To avoid that people move out their stuff in your downtime, you might want to camp the hole for 7 whole days, 24 hours a day. A corp needs at least 10 active players with a lot of free time to pull this off. I've participated a few times in an eviction (from both sides, the winning and the loosing party) and can't recommend doing this for low value holes. 
---
When Stranger Danger got evicted by Inner Hell, we lost about 400B. At that time we had 40+ active players, so thats about 10B a person on avg. If you follow Eve's no1 advice (don't fly what you can't afford to loose) then you should be able to replace that in a few days, throw some GF's in local and find another place to live :)
---
TL;DR : Being scared of an eviction is a bad reason for not moving into j-space!
---
Was gonna write the exact same thing. Now go make Trauma vol 2. Shoo, shoo!
---
Not OP or affiliated, but there’s basically a checklist of “am I probably going to get evicted”
---
N1 above anything else is your killboard. Do you frequently lose expensive ships to rats or ganks while krabbing? Do you like to whelp dreads or paladins fo sites? Is your only kill in a skiff?
---
Yeah someone’s probably going to poke your fortizar, azbel, whatever. You are big krab and they see you as a target. Especially feeding to NPCs consistently will say something about you not knowing what you’re doing. 
---
N2 is easy, keep your structures fuelled. If you live out of an unfuelled structure you’re losing it, simple yeah?
---
N3 is your structure fit like trash? It should be anti-cap fit.
---
N4 take good fights. If someone comes knocking and your merry band of idiots do a bunch and actually provide some content outside of MJD battleships basking in blue loot, people will be willing to help you. 
---
If you are big krab, then not so much.
---
Why marauder rat in a shitty c4 with bad spawns if you can just do it in a c5 for 300m isk/hr
---

---
I was bored, so I pulled the raw game file and did some AI up-scaling and sharpening on it.
---
&gt;On average,about how long do you play in a given day?
---
This should be around 1.5 hour a day.
---
It seems like that the Bhaalgorn originally was supposed to have a unique design, as can be seen in the Arts of Eve Book, but never got implemented... Maybe they ran out of time back then, and then just let it like it?
---
Given that it used to be higher, and ALL of them were paying...
---
Well, after rounding up Pyfa features I wanted to add, I now have time to learn something new. Ended up with picking Rust and started learning it already, thought it would be cool to mention it here :P
---
I have been only selling to buy order at Jita, with Accounting to 4 for lower sales tax and no broker fee.  
---
But sometimes I got module that got high price like Pithum C Invul and there is 25M Isk differential between sell and buy. I could sell with 10M differential but need to haul it to Dodixie.  
---
Based on what I read I could lower broker fee by skills and faction standing. I still need time for broker relations skill but how much standing (it said good &amp; maximum standing) should I grind for Jita ??
---
PLEX has been around for over a decade EVE saw its biggest peak between 2010 and 2014 and PLEX were readily available then.  Explain in your own words how exactly did the F2P drive people away?
---
You're spouting nonsense this entire post is nonsense just go back to whatever hole you crawled out of.
---
There is no such thing as "toxic community". Eve is a game. A social one. Is based on the concept of war. In order to have war, you need to spice things up. Sometimes behave like a jerk.  But most sane people understand that it is just a game. Those that are easily offended are amazing content generators and we all love them.
---
In my opinion, a good troll is an important asset in eve. All is about mind game and upsetting some people at some point. If your enemy is not invested in obliterating you, then you did a bad job and the fights won't be as fun. So you need to make them really hate you in order to have a real war. And you know how it is... in love and war everything is permitted.
---
From what I see, eve community is the best community you can hope for. It is not toxic. Is spicy. And I love habanero.
---
Ah I see, but I am seeing the might beans eviction, opposing corp have dreads too? Is it turncoat or what, I assuming they don't bring it from outside wormhole.
---
Honestly, I would kind of find it interesting to have a Dread that uses drones/fighters . Being imobile, but increasing the fighter damage. And without being able to use a ESN it also wouldn´t have the extreme range Carriers can have
---
If I used a different word instead - let's say "schmiggeldipoop" - would that change the argument at all? (just trying to be funny there). I'm saying "one could make an objective claim that OPs actions are harmful, as are his childrens'" because they harm others in a situation where their own benefit is not necessary. It's not like they need to scam people to live. So in this case I don't think an argument could be made that their actions are anything but un-schmiggeldipoop. I'm open to the possibility of a valid argument, though. It sounds like you agree with this to some extent as well. 
---
I brought up symantics because I think there's two commonly used versions of the word "morality". One seems to be to describe "a set of cultural norms wherein a group agrees to certain behaviors" (this could be for any reason, sound or otherwise) and then the philosophical use of the word which deals with a question like "how do I determine if an action should or should not be taken?". The first case is a kind of dead end because anyone can say anything and be validated by others who agree. The second is a philosophical goldmine. I use that particular definition because it is reasonable to first answer "will this action harm anyone?" and "will this action help anyone?" 
---
So while I agree that anyone can just say "well I disagree that people matter and therefore I can do what I want", they're not really arguing about the same thing. Anyone can say "I think the definition of gravity is really 1 apple + 1 orange = pizza", but we can still make objective claims about their splattered remains at the bottom of the 3 story building they jumped out of. 
---
Ps, what sub are we on again? :p
---
I finally got it working on my phone.
---
Its not half bad.

Bit simplistic and the ui is a tad clunky but for a mobile game it's very true to the desktop game. Imo.

You have pictures of his sister's feet, too? I thought I was special.
---
Do you think it has the potential to be good? Is there any crossover with the PC game? Like is your character crossed over?
---
Oh yes, please wait till majority of players are sleeping and post another's shty proof that eve I dying...
---
I see, thanks for responding. Appreciate your story.  
---
Its like a double edged knife right, if there is no triglavian ships dps, should dreads/fax have any other counter?
---
It feels good to me, when i heard about Blackout i reactivated my 2 acc after not playing them for years. It was time to end the Carebear Era of EVE.
---
Thanks for the reply! So its impossible to do a fit which will guaranteed do 100% of all possible spawn combinations even for t3-t4 electricalcs? With my skills your fit has 710 dps. How do you manage with triglavian spawns in t5's with this thermal hole? (It shows 59% to me with my skills and yeah ik your real resists are higher cuz of skills i dont have). And why you went AB over MVD? I feel like mvd is necessary for BS spawns and it boosts your general clearspeed a lot thanks to insane mobility boost compared to ab. ;
---
P.S Even electrical cap buff wasnt enough to comfortly do 3 starving vedmak spawn
---
He's one of those locals you just kinda know is always there but not really one of the family yeah?
---
JUMP M-0 would be a good one for your second vehicle.
---
It has not been a forgiving place, that much is true.
---
I had a guy who did not want to fleet up with me because he thought I was going to blow up his ship :-).
---
We had a great conversation and I ended up contracting him the Retriever I had in system. I think I blew his mind that day :-). We’re supposed to be assholes!
---
You're about to jump in to a whole world of exciting problems as soon as you do this. With little to no IT knowledge this will be tough.
---
Your choices on paying for the server or not depends on Corp size. With a Corp size of say 5-10 people you can probably shove it on an old desktop running Ubuntu or some other distro. However with a Corp size of a hundred you want to put this on a properly hosted server somewhere.
---
There are so many potential problems you might come across. PM me if you need help with stuff.
---
I can only reach climax while having internet arguments about morality on a forum dedicated to internet spaceships. It's a lonely kink, but today I learned I'm not alone.
---
I think playing with only one account will be difficult.
---
First of all rolling holes alone is a real pain in the ass. You will role yourself out one day or you get shot while moving some stuff to a trade hub.
---
I'm pretty sure there are some WH groups out there that respect your real life situation and who'll allow you to play mostly solo. Create a post on  [https://www.reddit.com/r/evejobs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/evejobs/)  and see what happens!
---
Have some internet points, you sure deserve some
---
&gt; Yeah, it's not as if people are outside your house blowing up your rl car, after all.
---
Well, they could be cutting electricity to the street so that you couldn’t log in and field your titan. That’s happened, so I’m not going to rule that out.
---
Good write up and good info. I've been thinking about moving some alts to a C5 for some time now, and this helps a lot. A few questions: 
---
\- do you also do PI? Depending on the planets in your home hole it's usually good semi passive money, but tbh having done so back in my wh days it does get very boring after the initial hype dies down and I ended up resetting my extractors only seldom. 
---
\- what do you think about using dreads to speed up the krab? is it too risky if you're solo in there and do you think the isk delta can be worth it anyway?
---
\- how did you get the hole you're in? was it just empty or was it like your former corp hole? it is my understanding that most c5 with effects are taken by big groups, and it seems a bit strange you can hold one for just yourself. Did you face any eviction attemps and if so how did you manage to repel invaders?
---
\- what's your number one advice for someone who would like to get started in this playstyle?
---
That's an alpha.
---
And a hundred other people did as well.
---
Why do you think you have to share this low effort garbage?
---
What is eve echoes ?
---
No!!! The lizard people win again!!!
---
I tried to do PI for a few days and it really bored the hell out of me. It can be a nice income for people tat can't run sites yet due to skill points. Not really sure about the current numbers, but I think one PI char can make about 500M a month. You can have 3 per account and I know some people who had like 3-4 accounts skilled into PI. 
---
I do like industry, but it would require me to travel more and puts more value in my hole. I would not recommend doing this when playing alone.
---
Thanks for the answer, but another question popped up in my head: have you ever looked at t3 production? If yes, then would you say it's worth it as a side activity(not to be a full-time miner, but just go harvest some gas from time to time)?
---
&gt;hat is your setup for doing the drifter, besides the bb?
---
Three nestors with each 2 cap transfers and 4 remote reps. I got some refits in my cargo for the more advanced sites. I will not share the full fitting here, but if you search on nestors lost in wormhole space, you will be able to find some good fits there. Just try it our in SISI :)
---
Yes yes, and unit tests stop it from eeeeeeever occuring again. Until it does due to a slightly different bug, of course. You can never be sure something won't happen again. You can fix the current bug so IT doesn't happen again but you cannot assure someone that the same or similar bug behaviour won't happen again as you cannot say for certain that another bug with the same or similar effect isn't still in the code until you hit it.
---
So.... as I said before.
---
A C5 Cataclysmic
---
There are three main reasons to get evicted. Someone wants to take the wh for themselves, someone wants free loot or someone is pissed at you.
---
The last one is easy to avoid, just don't do anything to get people mad at you.
---
For the other two you can use the fact that there are hundreds of C5s, most of which are solo farmholes. As long as you don't have a particularly good system it's just a matter of seeming like you're more effort than others and not worth it.
---
As much as I hate to suggest this, this is what the optimal use of game mechanics is: Anchor a couple of raitarus, space them out over all timezones and multiple weekdays. Don't let your main structure go to low power. Most people will just pick a different target.
---
If you do get your stuff reffed, which happened two times over the three years I've had my C5, evac/log off as much loot as you can. The key is to only ever have the essentials and maybe get an orca to store multiple ships.
---
Both "evictions" ended after my astra died and dropped like an iteron and two unfit megas. One time they also killed two of the raitarus but let the rest repair.
---
You just play dead for a week and then anchor replacements and keep going as usual.
---
The dumb is strong with this one.
---
*cries in Barra*
---
I wish you wouldve actually done the background research. Seadc has been around 6k members before the blackout even started, this is as unrelated as it gets.
---
The problem is that you still have to assert some framework for morality and take it as fact. You can do that if you want, and then you can say under this framework x is moral and y is immoral. What you can't do is say that, objectively, x is moral and y is immoral because I can just say my morals are antithetical to yours and so I disagree.
---
The solution to this issue is not to argue that something is bad because it's immoral, it's like trying to argue that music you like is good and music you don't like is bad. Like sure, we now see that that is your opinion, but who cares whether it's arch heresy according to you to listen to Nickelback or not.
---
You can't even make objective claims that scamming is harmful, ever heard of 'cruel to be kind'? I can argue that teaching people to not get scammed is actually more helpful over a longer period of time and happens faster if you scam them. That even solves your harm vs. help definition of morality, so you have to agree with me now, right?
---
Don't get me started on defining morality based on cultural norms, we have thousands of years of evidence that people are dicks even on the large scale. Yes, many people define morality by democracy but that's riddled with issues.
---
I guess the problem is you just can't make objective claims about morality, what you can do is say I think this harmful and outline why, if you really want to objectively show that a certain behavior is bad you need data. So either avoid the word objective or go on a citation hunt.
---
On topic, I think there are valid arguments for and against, without going and trawling through papers about child development I can't really decide. Although given that Eve is a video game, I'd err on the side of it's okay as long as this is understood (context is everything, btw) if kids are taught that it's okay to scam people because it's essentially financial pvp and in the context of a video game that is okay, then that's cool. As long as there is a disconnect between the game and irl, taking people's money is not cool, taking people's isk is fine. If anything, going out of your way to instill a disconnect between video games and irl behaviour is probably healthy, I can imagine a lot of toxicity comes from the fact that people care about their eve wealth, or whether they die in a video game. Who cares? It's a video game.
---
p.s. I understand this is r/eve but I saw someone try to tell other people what morality is and I just can't allow that to happen uncontested :D
---
I don't think wormholes are safe. Each second I'm out there scrammed and webbed with 3B on grid a wormhole can be opened and within 20 seconds a fleet can land on you. 
---
There is no intel and no one that can help me in the heat of the moment. 
---
Any exit needs to be scanned and will close in day or less. There is no JF service here, I need to haul in everything in/out myself.
---
Also there is no asset safety, when they blow up my sandcastle, everything drops on grid.
---
I have four Omega accounts and one Alpha account. In total I have 14 characters. 
---
And yes, with playing solo I meant not being dependent on other people.
---
All you gotta do is tell her you like the 7/10 toe look and she hands out the whole album.

So it wouldn't be a "classic" server. I have two words for you: -
---
Skill injectors.
---
Grrrrr crappy shitpost
---
They aren’t worried esp when echoes hits
---
Not OP but can answer bits.
---
Dreads are definitely faster but much more skill intensive and you tackle yourself for 5 minutes at a time. If anyone half competent rolls into you its gonna suck. Sub caps are slower but MJD means frustratingly your much more survivable should shit hit the fan.
---
Think he said he evicted the guys who lived there previously. Think cataclysmic is one of the less desirable effects. Best way to avoid eviction is to not be a good target. Keep stuff fueled etc.
---
You forgot "Grrr no one is logging in" and "Grrr i will not login into this shit either"
---
Even five years ago it meant that, at least to the players I played with (w-space if that matters).
---
Alts are just such an essential thing in this game that you just expect someone to have them and use them. 
---
The only context where I've seen "solo" used differently is in "solo pvp" and even there the lines get blurry when it's about pure utility alts like probers or off-grid boosters back in the day.
---
20% of all isk is generated in wormholes
---
&gt;Thanks for the answer, but another question popped up in my head: have you ever
---
I've done some T3 production in the past and I think industry can be a nice side-job. Eve can become boring if you do the same stuff every single day. So spreading your time between PVP, ratting, gas huffing and some industry is in my opinion a really good idea.
---
On the income part, I think running the sites will earn you more. But it's not always about making ISK. Try out some new stuff, learn something. Set some goals, its fun :)
---
It can get interesting if you're the main indy guy in a decent corporation that allows you to buy back their stuff. When I was a CEO of a wormhole corp most of my time got sucked up in running the corp. I almost had no time to run the sites. I had a buy back set-up for everything in the hole for 90% of the value. Only on gas this made me about 2-3B a month.

Don't blame the fall of EVE on us. We don't design the game, we don't make new content, we don't 'balance' ships like the rorqual. EVE's state is the result of CCPs questionable decisions and lack of commitment to the game.
---

link  to bhaalgorn alternate look?
---
Thanks!
---
Evicting bearholes is in most cases not very profitable, most of the time all valuable stuff is logged off in caps and won't drop.
---
They should just make Eve:Planetside and save both games.
---
At the second time. Awesome fights mate.
---
So, the bots left the high income areas for safer, low income activities, resulting in less isk and minerals generated out of thin air?
---
It seems to be working as intended.
---
It's a click bait headline.
---
For _newbies_, when they have their first big loss, they'll be contacted and talked to. Like an explanation of why they lost their ship and so on.
---
Like when you blow up a newbie in lowsec, then convo them and maybe refund their ship if they're not an asshole.
---
People's first meaningful loss is an inflection point wrt retention. Either they quit immediately, or they're hooked. And social support makes a big difference with which happens.
---
A disingenuous title. More like "CCP will offer tips and feedback along with reimbursement on a case-by-case basis after the first loss on an account".
---
Can't fuck up eve if they are fucking up side projects instead :P
---
Up until now ... you weren’t really worried? I’ve misread every post you’ve ever made
---
Ccps doing a lot to kill off bots. It's an endless task, but they're far from ignoring them.
---
Sounds like they'll also be learning it has consequences.
---
It has potential. Looks pretty good. Very simplified, but its have to be. (Skills train real time, but they're locked in a progression tree. So you have to master x skills at a level, before the next level opens up)
---
No link to PC eve. At all. It's just the same IP. So one doesnt touch the other.
---
It's not like this has already been posted 10 hours ago or anything....
---
I was worried, but in a way : "Hell this is not looking fun for me" but now it is like "Hell it is actually not looking good for EVE"

My bad. Searched for the words in the title and it returned nothing.
---
It's almost like you'd expect that being that it's in their staging system :shockedpikachu:
---
grrrr cheapisk.com is fake news
---
For the last several weeks, when people mentioned that concurrent users online was down, people said it was bots quitting. This data suggests that no bots have left, they all relocated. So if players online has gone down by thousands all hours of the day, then that would mean that tens of thousands of people have quit playing EVE since the blackout started. That would be really, really bad. So now the narrative has changed from "that drop is just bots leaving" to "well the bots are making less isk, so that's a win."
---
it happens when you log off or safe log that your ship isnt removed, petition and you will get the hull and the dead mods back
---
Yep. I was referring to the PC gamer headline :) 
---
This is all about the questions you ask with data. 
---
"Are people who get ganked more likely to stay" vs "are people who stay more likely to have been ganked" for example. Sound similar, but actually quite different.
---
it was in a C5, dreads (and faxes) can go through C5-&gt;C5/C6/LS/NS holes.  
---
I wasnt there but I suppose they bring caps via this kind of hole. It can be hard to do. move the dreads through LS/NS as fast as possible because you cant keep the hole wide open for long. it's a siege, defencers will try to bring reinforcements.  
---
for C4 and below there are only few possibility for attaquers to have caps in their side.  
---
maybe the attaquers had a spy who steal some caps from beans  
---
they looted the dreads in the first citadel they destroyed (that's why you should never spread your home def fleet in several citadels)  
---
or, sometime, if the fight last more than one week, you can buidt your own caps before the final timer. only saw it one time for Pospy eviction if I remember right
---
You do realise that those carebears and whales make up most of eve subs that ccp needs to run the game?
---
That’s not what I got from his tweets at all. I saw a balanced view on eves future. I believe he still thinks the changes were for the best and more needs to be done

But are they vpn ing? Are they safe from the IP ban? Are they sure the company doesn't already know all these accounts are tied to each other?

Gotta make sure they practice safe scamming.
---
Your name sounds familiar, I'm pretty sure I ran into you once when you were in Stranger Danger. Anyway, good AMA, thank you!   
---
I'm on the solo path myself due to time restrictions, not decided yet what to do, camping farm holes would be an option, but also your way of playing.
---
No i dont play p2w clash of clans ripoffs and false advertisement games
---
Now this is turning into child labour ...
---
... thinking like a true capsuleer.
---
And meow* ftfy!
---
Nice never knew that!
---
But still the damage doesn´t affect the performance unless your stuff gets destroyed/burned out.
---
You can blame everything at us and it doesn't change the fact that EVE is in decline. Even if you convinced Goons somehow not to play this way, someone else would and eventually you end up with the same thing.
---
Without correct changes in CCP's end, there's no stopping of EVE's decline.
---
It doesn't matter what they like and downvotes don't matter either. The only thing that matters is making the game more asymmetric in the kind of counters we can employ, so that not every single encounter has to be about escalation and n+1.
---
If they can't handle that, well, too bad, because that's the foundation the game has been built on from the beginning and it's trying to move back towards that direction.
---
The current meta is not the norm, it's an anomaly brought to life by careless design decisions from CCP and the players min-maxing them.
---
I feel sorry for olmeca and everyone else's efforts in getting this shitshow out of the swamp. Ccp doesnt care anymore, hillmar and pets are leaving in november. Ccp is going full korean grind fest p2w after that.
---
"what you see doesn't exist"
---
you are doing it right now...  
---
" bots in highsec are far less invasive than those in nullsec "  
---
Define "invasive", there is even less threat to those bots being disrupted or killed in highsec meaning their income is eve more steady then nullsec.  
---
"  Being able to know 100% of the time with certainty that there is someone anywhere close or able to attack you is terribly unbalanced and dangerous to the nullsec ecosystem. "  
---
That never existed, even people using shit like NEAR2 needed someone in the system the player was in to call them out in intel before the program could tell you someone was coming, or in your words "what you see doesn't exist"  
---
" No one in their right mind is against the local removal change, even your leadership is in favor of it 'on paper'."  
---
You seem to have it stuck in your head that I'm anti-black out, honestly I'm ambivalent, I like that it makes me harder to see coming when I go solo hunting, but I don't like that it has drastically cut down the number of people in space for me to hunt. But for the purposes of this thread, I have only stated that it is one of several reasons that other players have quit the game, that is neither for, nor against the concept of blackout, simply a statement of fact.
---
IMO ALL T2 ships should be allowed to light a cyno, (and not cheap t1 or ofc t1 capitals) 
---
include this idea of t2 cyno disruption. or the ability to switch off a cyno (or at leas make them land at the sun instead)
---
keep all changes expected (maybe give JF's some way to having a cyno on somthing able to travel itself to next desti, ie a badger travelling through lowsec or nullsec isnt likely to survive, and if it does, itll die first time it lights its cyno lol.
---
i think if we are going to maybe include capitals then lighting a cyno should either use a huge amount of fuel of somekind to do so, or seriously negatively affect the ship lighting it, ie: switch every module off, offline shields to 0% or kill the ship lighting the cyno at the end of its cycle (to remove rorquals from using it as a defence)

I sense a great disturbance in the force, as if 150 blazing madmen simultaneously cried out **"WITNESS ME"**

Im not "classic" weeb, I just like to watch anime(as well as films), and think that anime pictures looks more neatly than screens from films for my targets :)

Entosis Links should be usable on Cynos and block further jumps.

---
Fair point. 🤔
---
lets be honest, look at where the devs got the game so far, himar stepping up and dealing with it is what he is in his postion for, and to be honest, hes doing it well and i kinda like the guy even if he is destroying an old part of the game to create a huge new one
---
i agree with this, but if this came in, capital ships would need to have a SERIOUS buff to be able to better defend themselves, as at the moment, one capital ship alone is completely useless against subs (as intended)
---
is that confirmed that he will leave ?
---
With a shitty title that doesn´t give any indication of what the post might contain.
---
You did good, at least you used a title that actually gives info about what the post is about! ;)
---
Okay so two options:
---
1) kill the weebs 
---
2) a weeb utopia where all weebs are put and cannot leave
---
Pick one but pick carefully. The correct option brings back the AT.
---
Daniels work is amazing, and a really good bloke! Was super sad when he left :(
---
How did we ever cope before this?
---
and it only took how long?
---
Why would he stay? His bonus check gets cut when the 1 year period ends in a little over a month, and he's already invested a big chunk of his own personal money in the next gaming company he plans on shitting up for the next decade.
---
too radical
---
I choose third option - I will go to fanfest 2020 and ask CCP to bring back AT %)
---
50% siege time reduction would be a really interesting bonus :O Maybe some speed hull bonuses. The new drifting hotness!
---
Mate I'm just excited to be part of it. This is a group about eve, it isn't only for things that you find interesting. What is your problem
---
I'd just like to say that Olmeca's new Promethium lined swimming pool sets off his 24- room luxury azbel wonderfully
---
Wrong answer now CCP has banned your and Pandi's accounts and half of Ice Tim's!
---
When you've trained Cryptography V, and not one tick sooner
---
read the wiki page on eve-uni find some setup you think will produce something that you can sell, produce it and sell it, like don't let perfect be the enemy of good just setup anything and see if you turn a profit you can always change it later.
---
my friend managed to get it working and he was fighting merlin but on kill it was kestrel -,-

---
The conclusion states hes hoping ccp listens to the CSM.... if that doesnt spell doom idk what does. Ccp having a track record for doing the opposite....
---
Oh, I am enjoying it to.
---
None of that makes this post not low effort garbage.
---
You're well behind this even being a new and interesting piece of information.
---
It's not CCPs project afaik. They simply provided the ingame assets for the aether war devs to use for theit test.      
---
It's crashing was also the whole point of the test
---
Oh, small gangs used to do something very important for the game. They could keep big, fat alliances in check so that they don't gobble up the entire map.
---
Small gangs don't care about putting 15 alts in titans, they care about the personal skill of each player in their team. Comparing them to hisec gankers just shows how much safety you guys think you're entitled to in **zero security space.** Like i've said before, there are week-old newbros hauling expensive shit through the usual ganking spots in hisec that have more balls than this.
---
You say "if you don't work, you don't eat".  That's what the small gangs are there for. To make you work for your space. Small gangs don't need or want the kind of isk null blocs want, they can live with much less. They are raiders and they keep things in balance by not letting you guys grow too big.
---
But for years, you had instant counters to completely negate their playstyle. Now that they get something back, you guys all suddenly think the game is unplayable. Sorry, i can't sympathize with this one bit. I just think part of the playerbase has become too pampered and spoiled over the years and they think it's normal for them to slowly kill the game and every other playstyle. Well, it's not.
---
For a more detailed explanation, the reply by /u/M2Dazas has a lot of good points (actually, i should thank him for saving me the effort of having to type the same things myself), one of which is that small gang is also where people learn to FC. And i've been hearing quite a bit about a lack of FCs starting to show recently in null blocs. Some people burn out, some take breaks or leave the game, and some just go and join the exact guys you dislike. They leave null blocs and join small gang groups, (back to where they began) because it's boring for them having to manage everything themselves, only to be blue with half the map and have to travel to the other end of the galaxy to get a fight, which may not even happen and if it does, it often is a structure bash. If this goes on, we'll be seeing alliances with huge fleets of capital ships and nobody to command them. Well, the feeding that would ensue would be monumental, so that's probably one way to fix the problem :)
---
Still, like i said before, the game is an ecosystem. If you faill to see that and only see things through your own playstyle, then your own playstyle will also die in the end because it will have nothing to feed off. You bring up some good points, but there is noticeable entitlement and "my way of playing the game is better" showing through your post, so i can't really sympathize with you.
---
Either adapt to the changes and play the game, or don't and stop playing. My friends and i stopped playing in 2006, i came back after 12 years, some of my friends come and go and some never played again. We could see that our playstyle was gradually getting killed by the game moving to bigger and bigger ships and that's why we left. But the game didn't die without us and it won't die without you either. If it's too much for you, evacuate your stuff out of null, take a break and come back in a year or two. It's fine.
---
:"(
---
Even if you autopiloting and multiboxing, you check them time to time. And not only within a few+ hours
---
Try to work at redfrog
---
&gt;Like when you blow up a newbie in lowsec, then convo them and maybe refund their ship if they're not an asshole.
---
I do this is nullsec too. A few weeks back I was trying out blackout as a solo Hound like many do, and I killed a solo hordling in an Algos belt ratting. I convo'd him
---
"are you a genuine newbro?"
---
and he replied
---
"yep, a few weeks old, but I'll get you next time m'wahahahahaha! :-)"
---
I asked
---
"do you get SRP?"
---
He asked back
---
"what's SRP?"
---
so I told him what it stands for and to check what the Horde do and do not SRP, and then comp'd him double the lossmail value just in case.
---
Change Cyno duration to 60s.
---
If your rescue doesn't get in within the 60s after being lit, the inhibitor will prevent further attempts to light it, and you'd have to move a new cyno 100km away, etc.
---
There were easy solutions to this problem, but none of them are generating the comedy that is CCP's 'cHaOs ErA'.
---
I got :           
---
1. That he is shocked that nullsec CSM are not playing CCP but want what is good for the game and are trying to fix the game           
---
2. He wish  that CCP listen to what CSM is saying           
---
3. That the game can go into better direction (i assume what CSM is proposing) or we can expect bad things and shitshow (i assume what CCP is planning)              
---
We know what CCP is planning and doing - aka Chaos, we can assume what CSM are asking ... we know what they stated over the time.                  
---
CSM idea of the game != CCP idea of the game                
---
Or did i get something wrong?
---
I don't know how to do either. I just have experience using ones of comparable complexity in RS. These bots were speaking of in Eve aren't new, they've been around already, clearly someone already figured it out.
---
If you look at the market the assault frigates are all named T1 Hull mk.2
---
EVE is in a very specific place atm.        
---
Is there a chance that CSM can share some light on 'what the hell is happening' without breaking the NDA?
---
Go to the market and look at the details for an Orthrus, it's an image of a Cynabal.
---
You make them sound like they are safe when talking about living there solo for 6 months and not losing a ship. Even if you did lose all ships on grid, it would take 5-6 hours to replace them (calculated from your own estimates, including rolling, scanning and ratting) whereas it would take 6-7 hours to replace a ratting carrier in null (assuming 150 M/hr rate).
---
If I have understood the "chaos era" correctly, you nowadays have the same amount of "heads-up" as in null if the attackers come from WH, or more than in null if the attackers come from stargate as in the latter case you see them when they get to within dscan range instead of seeing a sig pop up in probe scanner when there might be someone coming. For a carrier, there's no hope of cavalry anyways since you'll be dead too fast if tackled. Supers are different if under an umbrella, but they take way longer to replace if lost.
---
I don't know how fast one can get off the sleeper scrams, but on the other hand the attackers need to probe scan you, which is not necessary in null so they might cancel each other, at least roughly. Please let me know if this is not a valid assumption.
---
The main difference is, as far as I see it, the selling of loot. In null you get the ISK instantly, but in WHs you need to sell it in empire. The logistics take time, but the loot is small in volume (the blue loot), so you can use cloakies to move it pretty safely. I used to do null logistics through wormholes and never lost a blockade runner once. Sure, it takes more time, but you can move such a large value in short time that it doesn't decrease the effective ISK/hr that much. Also citadels dropping loot is mostly a non-issue as loot can be stored on logged-off toons so the value of things that would drop can be kept low.
---
This all is of course assuming one knows what one is doing. In wormholes you have to put less assets on field in terms of "hours-of-ratting-to-replace", and you make more effective ISK/hr at the cost of having to keep on moving loot out of the hole and not use it as a warehouse to pile stuff at since you could lose everything stored there.
---
If he is starting new company with previous CCP owners/investors already ...
---
Yes, the Amarr way is the true capsuleer way.
---
region / constellation chat when?
---
Still crying about the nerf to super / capital umbrella in 0.0?
---
Just let them play eve :) They'll love Jita local.
---
Having keyboard shortcuts to scan functions doesn't mean that you can automate the whole process. How do you go about identifying anomalies and organizing the probes in a fashion to scan them down to get a warpable result?
---
&gt; I believe he still thinks the changes were for the best and more needs to be done
---
Yeah.
---
I'd wager that the talks moved him from thinking the rest of the CSM was deliberately catering to only their wants and be damned if anyone else suffers, to now just feeling like the null bloc of CSM members may just not have enough incite into what alternative playstyles actually exist in null.
---
This is the chaos in the CCP finance too !
---
Chaos can be good, when tuned properly.
---
Nullsec losing local though was LONG over due.
---
Pretty sure it was on CSM talking points many many years ago.

Firstly, you'll need omega accounts to multibox. That alone stops a ton of botters.
---
Secondly, there's no highsec system that can offer the same level of null sec isk for a plex a month to make botting profitable. From my experience anyway.

This doesn't necessarily require going full grind fest or any of that.

The game will probably get a lot of new players when it launches in Korea properly, especially if Pearl Abyss gets it into PCbangs with free Omega (while playing in PC bangs).
---
You have conjecture of a handful of people saying that they've seen them. That's it. Is it possible they have them? It could be. Have I seen enough evidence of it to support the claims? Not really. Not as much as I've seen for mining and site running bots.
---
Gross.
---
That's been happening since the first person got a super and even when people could teleport supers all over the map the playerbase wasn't this low. It was probably when it was most popular.

Wait chaos is bad? Who would have thought :] but yea that what I got too

He doesn't either.  Don't pretend that he does.  He's just spams out the same retarded ideas 1,000 people before him had.
---
Pop in game reads "don't do that again, that was not a smart move stupid".
---
He represents a large enough portion of the player base to get his spot.
---
So maybe you could make a stronger effort than just calling it "retarded."
---
....you really made a shitty slideshow trailer for a PVE site?

Like there was a post like 2-3 weeks ago on reddit with all the links.    
---
Didn't save it, but based on other comments i was not only one that read it.
---
Its hard to be a zealous reddit warrior when you are face to face with other people irl. Maybe we will see some more maturity when posts here too.
---
Its almost like anyone with a brain said this was going to happen.  Too bad nobody in CCP is from this group.
---
All I'll say at the moment is wait for the minutes. Sorry.
---
hmm, didn't see it.
---
We can't trust anything Olmeca says EVER!
---
Don't confuse having voted for him with his "representing" anyone but himself.  The game is rapidly going downhill and his 'campaigning' on here is part of the reason.
---
Now we're clear on that, fuck off.
---
nice one!
---
Fair enough. I completely misunderstood what you were saying, thank you for clarifying.
---
Eh that's more like 5k
---
Imagine only charging 25bil
---
So you're saying EVE players are willfully voting for a representative they don't agree with?
---
Its per week
---
Maybe people didn't want EVE to be hard after all...
---
We're just shedding dead weight tbh
---
Okay so i don't know if this is sincere or not. I haven't been paying attention. But you could read this as sarcastic.
---
Turns out they are all actally pos guns that can move.
---
It's a alpha, what do you expect? Give them the time to fix bugs?!
---
Technically, we are, I'm just answering a comment saying we "lost" 15000 bots since Jan 2019, which is untrue.
---
Blackout wasn't made for bots, it would be even more retarded a change that it is already.
---
Don’t know what you mean with Dust it never happened I think u mean Rust??? ;) :D
---
Is always releasing this immediately after downtime intentional or unintentional?
---
Because that does always fudge the final point lower than it would be.
---
Without that it looks not unlike early '17
---
So the truth finally penetrated his tin foil dome? Great! Of course that begs the question on how many more anti goon boneheads will have to be elected just to prove that csm isn’t metagaming to their own benefit every summit.
---
I don't understand people saying stuff like this : "We got rid of the weed so the game will fare better".
---
In your example, you break some eggs and get bankrupt so you cannot cook it because you cannot pay the gas/energy bills anymore.
---
Did blackout make some krabs leave the game ? Yes. It is good for the game ? According to hardcore blackout fans, yes, according to everyone else and CCP's accountant, no.
---
Now that they've all switched to miner iis he needs to make money somewhere!
---
5y is a long time for comparison.
---
In true Eve spirit, the first thing I thought was, 'when circumcision goes wrong.'
---
It certainly keeps with the phallic aesthetic. Though I like the cross between maller and ashimmu
---
I'm an ex nullsec player, I moved to WH but from my point of view this update is bad, it was a massive buff for hunter while PVE player only get nerf. Hunter have a large panel of tools to help them hunt, zkillboard, dotlan, in game map and now no local+no cyno, in WH you have the same tool to defend and hunt : Dscan (Ok, you can add probe scanner to see new connection for the defender).
---
While this patch was great to counter bot in nullsec, I think it still lack of "something" to make it viable for both party, and if you are one of those saying "duuuh fuck carebear" keep in mind that's our favorite prey, if they leave we run out of fuel
---
Dont care about lp payouts tbh. FW needs healthy plex combat above everything else. Just get all these stabbed bots out of the damn large plexs.
---
I appreciated the comment about churches as seen from above. I like to see designers make those kind of connections
---
sorry my bad :-D that makes perfect sense!
---
Case in point: I used to fit up battleships that would keep pace with cruiser roams for funsies. Terrible fits, but I was basically the flagship of every one of those... and faster than the cruisers a couple times.
---
They are braying about the loss of their 99% safe null sec. Yes it’s intentional.
---
You mean 2am in New york time zone and 7/8am in EU on a weekday isnt the prime time for players? Wow who would have guessed that!! /s
---
It's stainguy, that would probably break him.
---
So, who on the CSM represents people just out looking for fights that have no interest in hunting or krabbing and would prefer not to tackle a Rorqual or four to get them?
---
You should take advantage of that deal
---
Agreed. You must have at least 15 roq kills not to be considered dead weight. Doesnt matter how cool of a dude you are, be an elite pvper or gtfo.
---
But I like Stainguys posts, they beat “eve is dying” post 3657

Well glad you enjoy it but a solo 5characters C5 corp will not last forever, as soon as someone will take a look at your sandcastle it will turn into a loot party ^^
---
Is this bot?
---
How so?
---
Blackout has been a change called for since I first played EVE in 2009.
---
It was long over due.
---
no one cares, krab
---
I'm honestly surprised they tried to recreate Eve so completely. I wonder if this will even attract the more casual audience of mobile gamers.
---
&gt; CCP's accountant
---
Do you have the information we don't?
---
The point is that the game was losing players as was. So the status quo was clearly not going to be practical.
---
Making changes to make the game stronger will often make some people leave. That's the reality of any major game. Some people will just hate it. Even if the long term it is beneficial.
---
But to believe that blackout was ever expected to solve everything, or is going solve it alone is nonsensical. It is part of a suite of changes that need to happen. Some of which will even mitigate the overall effects of the black out.
---
I’ll never understand the allure of mobile gaming,.
---
Trader here who has nothing to do with null anymore. I was up to around 900bil net worth and now I"m at 700bil due to the changes. I was chasing being a trillionaire and kind of got discouraged after that. I know it's silly but I stopped playing mostly just due to that.
---
Were in a situation where capital ships and supercaps are thrown around like theyre nothing and there’s literally hundreds of titans. Maybe it was too easy to krab before and balance is finally evening out. I feel like thats the direction CCP is moving towards with these changes. It should be very risky to make enough isk to fly capitals fast. And as a wormholers as well my favorite prey is other wormhole pvp groups to fight so...
---
&gt;  The game is rapidly going downhill and his 'campaigning' on here is part of the reason.
---
Well his campaign started, when the game WAS already downhill. Lets not forget the big player exodus started with Citadel 2016 and Lifeblood 2017 Rorquals,Moonmining), that halved the Login-count from 2015 to 2018 from 55-60 thousand on Saturday EU prime 2015 to 25-35 thousand right before blackout. It is in fact and proven by all official statistics, that the patches that catered towards a far to safe afk-multibox-grind-meta "killed" the game, not a guy who just adresses these facts.
---
....No.
---
The UI just isn't that great.
---
But also the game has multiple versions of the same ships at higher tech levels.
---
Just look at Talwars. There are like 3 different Talwars.
---
imagine thinking you can change anything made by a private company by spamming some petition
---
Please send emotional support ISK
---
Tbf you should have seen some.of the convoes I got after being elected
---
looks like  future plans
---
Changes are fine, nothing bad happening to EVE.
---
Temporary angry people left the game, CCP Rise said they dont care.
---
Not all phones support that feature unfortunately. The best and easiest thing I can think of is to move all pictures/video/music to your sd card and only use your phone for apps. If you are technically capable, you could install another Android OS like Lineage OS, I think that might support installing an app on an SD Card (although I'm not 100% sure if it depends on the phone model, even with Lineage OS).
---
Sure, the Whiptail exists.
---
People want EVE to be hard for *other players*
---
Broken bot.
---
He has a gsf/imperium alt for blue warpins. He doesn’t hunt organically without them.  
---
That would take skill.
---
There was more drop from release of wow classic than blackout
---
I mean we're regularly confronted with evidence that many CCP employees know nothing about Eve... Why would a third party microtransaction developer be any better... 
---
(Not you ccp_falcon we love you)
---
Has CCP done anything that wasn't tied to the Eve IP?
---
As in they voted for you and never knew what you stood for? or they knew what you stood for, didn't agree with it and voted for you anyway?
---
Doing it from end of 2013. Maybe 70 percent of that period.
---
It's like Deja Vu all over again.
---
This thing is a budget phone from a brand not even on the lineage OS menu... Also mediakek
---
I don't disagree nullsec needed changes. I even don't disagree blackout could be a good part of it.
---
What I disagree on is blackout with nothing else.
---
Because everyone knows that CCP takes 5 years to go back and iterate on a change. And because everyone knows that changes must be planned, not randomly implemented.
---
Payout and combat is what move people to plex.
---
That are the basics of sales education today, idk why you worried?
---
&gt; but on the other hand the attackers need to probe scan you
---
Except they don't, because 95% of the time in C5's &amp; 6's, Dreads are at Anoms. The only time they would have to be scanned would be if they site has despawned due to killing the driftyboi on the last wave.
---
Additionally, people logon trap capitals in high class holes all the time, which makes signature spawns not the only source of danger.
---
&gt; take advantage of other people in a way that harms them and benefits themselves is clearly immoral based on my previously stated definition.
---
That is basically the backbone of capitalism and the true story of how the 1st world got to where its at by "taking advantage of colonies and their riches in a way that harmed these colonies for hundreds of years".
---
All CPP want to do is make their bonus and then extract as much money out of the playerbase in injectors, skins and plex as they can before the game becomes commercially nonviable.
---
I think that Eve players are far more willing to help newer players than any other game I have played.
---
One piece of advice that gets thrown about is "Message the player that killed you and ask what you did wrong".
---
I've taken this advice twice so far and both times had good replies, despite the fact that if I get better, I'll eventually be able to be a pain in the arse for those people.
---
There's an illusion of people being toxic, and obviously some are, but I think overall the players and community are "Harsh but Fair"
---
Again, that "suite" of change is not CCP way of doing things. CCP does one thing, and then leave it to rot for 10 years. And you don't make money by pissing off a big part of you playerbase.
---
You want blackout to be understood, you want arguments on CCP part, an implementation plan of everything that goes along with it. Change management is a real job out there. If you want people to adopt your change, they need to know why it is implemented (not the usual bittervet/smallgang rant of "we need more free target because we cannot be assed to step up"), what is coming along with it that will either alleviate this change or add new things so you don't feel gutted, you want to reassure people.
---
You don't want to implement a change in less than 1 week and leave player in the dark (lol) about what you're gonna do next. That's bad.
---
Also no, I don't have more information than you, and -5k concurrent logged user is not something to underestimate.

Sounds interesting i always only find wormholes while exploring... Maybe i start jumping in tho
---
I wouldn't call it toxic, but there's a definite divide between 'people that simply have a low tolerance for obvious bullshit and whining'  and 'people who have a low tolerance for anyone not doing things their way period'.  The exception to this would be the small minority who use the games hardcore reputation as an excuse to be as deliberately offensive as they can (people who use white supremacist memes and make jokes about gassing jews, I am looking directly at you here), those guys are toxic as fuck.
---
The deeply entrenched positions on play style (seriously how long have people been rehashing the 'gankers are just griefers' argument by now?) and development priorities (Which area should have what features etc etc) don't really help either.
---
Having said that I've always found the eve community overall to be pleasant, welcoming and helpful even though I may not personally like a lot of the people involved in it .
---
I would definitely agree with you.
---
There are other obvious issues with the state of nullsec, many of which maybe should have been prioritized before blackout, or planned to come out with black out.
---
Based on my not super in depth knoweldge on all of this I'd think Blackout needs to be coupled with the following:
---
- limited resource spawn (mining and combat anomolies) to encourage sprawl. This change would also disproportionately affect large groups, as smaller groups may simply never but up against the soft cap of system population density. With more sprawl, some corps and players will see less reason to be in the super blocs as most blocs can't meaningfully protect ALL that space anyway, or some space may be protected weaker. This gives more room for corps to decide to instead take there own small pocket, as joining the big bloc won't get them much more safety than taking their own space.
---
- increase in rewards from combat sites and combat anomolies (potentially via escalation, I'm not decided on the best way to handle this, but straight bounty increases are probably a bad way since even with the current risk, most ships will earn their own value back well before dying even when playing dumb). This can balance this new risk both from the sprawl and the blackout, while encouraging more movement across space.
---
- some kind of communication structure that provides some kind of local, but never real time. Enough to help you know if someone if just hanging out, but not enough to give you an instant warp away signal.
---
But I am not an expert, but these make sense to me. Get targets in space, and makes the risk meaningful.
---
Why don't you give me a few billion then. Or better yet, a link to your spreadsheets!
---
Inspired?
---
who cares if these players are the ones that pay with real money instead of botted isk!
---
My experience is that people who have no clue what they are talking about say this line all the time. It's such bullshit and people who actually live in high class space will tell you what a joke that is. Fear mongering at it's best...
---
Try it out and see, I've been fine in my C6 for over 2 years...give good fights, don't be a pussy or a jerk and you'll be fine.
---
&gt; -5k concurrent logged user is not something to underestimate.
---
Sure, but we don't know the monetary value of that.
---
Not sure why people think CCP would be fucking with their financials before bonus stuff (and also talk about how CCP doesn't care about EVE because they can make the stats look good for the bonus).
---
But yes, I agree communication has been pretty shit on all of this.
---
Back in 2013 when I was playing last, communication was a lot better, with clear statements of goals of changes, and reviews on whether changes met the goals.

Not fully correct, you can do it with Alphas and VMWares (soapboxing), I also read that some chinese even used a bot to create the random Mail-Adresses for every Alpha and the Alpha account itself. Also with VMWares you can minimize the required Hardware
---
I actually agree with you. Long time eve players don't understand how unappealing it is to start in a game with real time training and realize you're always going to be 15 years behind unless you farm like crazy for skill injectors.
---
Let a new generation of EVE players be born. Unfortunately this would only work if CCP addressed the massive problems in the game (Timers, Bots, Capitals/Supers) before re-releasing a new instance and that isn't even happening now.
---
I'd personally love to see a new server instance with redistribution resources, systems/regions re-arranged, and with more PvE content that isn't mindbogglingly boring.

So the battle begins...

fact : morality is what drives the building of a society as a group of human being. it's like instincts, but on a social level
---
fact : society is based on "don't do to me something, and I won't do it to you". That's the reciprocity of violence, if you accept to harm someone then you accept to be harmed more because people will band to retaliate.
---
fact : thus harming someone without a reason and on purpose is a bad thing.
---
fact : morality is thus not a "non-objective" thing.  
---
What is subjective is the trade-off one can accept to do. eg can I steal in order to survive ? Can I kill in order to survive ? But doing a thing like scamming is a bad thing, in every place in the world. In a video game, and assuming there is no money involved, this moral does not stand (because there is no society)
---
Mate, I know that this is EVE Echoes gameplay, which is under a NDA. I'll give you some time to delete it, since CCP will give you none. Just delete it before I report it ok?

so, about that gas...I'll buy it from you :)

Well done, nice write up.

What do you think of the fact, that actually we might have lost maybe 2k logins per day since blackout, but (as proven by officially released CCP stats and EVE-Offline-Stats. but lost about 25-30k logged in accounts in the timespan between early 2016 and end of 2018 (far before blackout) ?

You don't mention using capitals, is that to avoid drawing attention or do you use a Fort simply because that is a deterrent against getting reffed? Would an Astra work as well otherwise?

How long do you think your playing solo will last? Every time I've tried going solo, I usually quit after a month or two. Do you think you might eventually quit the game because of this?

In a similar spot. As a solo I’d recommend WH diving into C3s rather than moving in fully. Eliminates a lot of the logistics required to live in WH space (and commitment) and trades a bit more danger (excitement) and setup work to find a hole everyday instead. Given the number of C3s with low sec static’s only takes me 10-20min to find a good C3 to spend some time in if you live on the edge of low sec. once you find one, I jump in with my Gila (~300m fit) and run a few combat sites that net 40m each and take ~20min.

I said "supposed to be end game content". As in, the stuff people have been injecting into in droves and now complain about getting nerfed, or the playstyles that have been touted as the pinnacle of achievement in EvE for the better part of the last decade. It's certainly not my end game and i've been around in the early days long enough to know the game is what you make of it.

So did I. When it was first announced I was ecstatic. Then they announced it would be based on the old *WOD* and have some of the same roguelight elements featured in EVE and I was even more excited; however, you must remember (as I am sure you do) that WOD was announced in an era of EVE that existed *before* Hilmar demonstrated conclusively that CCP was a one hit wonder.

It became anyone business when they opened the thread to a guy broadcasting his breaking the NDA. He's not exactly ease dropping on op.

Unfortunately not all WiNGSPAN members that leave or get removed from corp drop the flair. If kristallnachte (whoever he is?) would still be in the corp and talk like this he'd be out on his ass for breaking the Customer Service V etiquette.
---
This community continues to lose IQ points.  If the majority of the EvE universe really thinks Bots are unsubbing we are epically naive.   They are only reorganizing, recalibrating, and moving.  The Bots are adapting and will continue to thrive, the casual player is losing.   Wake up and realize Black Out is a huge failure.  We are spreadsheet gamers, the data is there for all to see.  We just need to take the blinders off and quit pushing an agenda before our game dies for all eternity.

I think better default player overviews and tabs would be very helpful. Default key binds could be more robust  as far as presets go.

Lets just shut down servers, this puts end to boting for sure!

Or you know, just scrap FAXes altogether. They were only added to the game to move the repair role away from carriers, and are also the only properly scaled capital class these days (making them overly large)

So if one then wants to move the repair role completely away from capital ships, you can just scrap them.
---
&gt;e into what alternative playstyles actually exist in null.
---
Ehh... not really. He was elected on a platform of grr goons. There is not a sizable enough portion of the player base that has an army of alts used to boosh excavators and occasionally drop dreads on supers in delve to say, "his play style represents enough of EVE's player base to get him elected."
---
10 isk from me
---
Tell Hilmar that then.
---
&gt; Please provide citations when making silly claims.
---
it's not citations you need but education.
---
You are making too many assumptions here to validate your own point. I'm just saying the combination of certain game design choices by CCP and the way certain parts of the playerbase used them has made the game boring for anyone who's not part of that group, essentially forcing everyone into a single playstyle and making things even more boring.
---
Nobody said anything about "elite pvp". All i'm saying is certain game mechanics and their min-maxing by certain players has made it not worth to give any fucks about nullsec in general.
---
Null dwellers can either recognize this and accept their comfort zone getting rearranged so other people have a reason (and a reasonable chance) to compete with them so they can all have some fun, or they don't and they just end up playing with each other, in almost complete isolation from the rest of the game, until they get bored and quit.
---
Like education regarding the definition of words?
---
I don't know how that fact about local isn't blindingly obvious to all. If you're using local not to chat, in local, but as an intelligence tool to make things safer in what's supposed to be the most dangerous space in the game (or 2nd, besides J-space maybe), that's an issue.
---
How do you know it's not just autopilot?
---
Well even if that were true, it would make him multiple times as smart as you!
---
A cheap way of giving it a try is by deploying a small tower in a hole with a HS connection. 
---
If you're new to wormhole space, you could try a C1 hole for a few weeks. The ISK is bad but you can learn it with very low risk. Once you understand all the mechanics, its easy to scale up.
---
Don’t tell them that! They’re elite...they only have fully balanced, fair PvP battles against small gangs of equal size and strength or 1 vs 1s. They DONT sit cloaked and wait for a safe time to drop on miners and ratters...duh. They’re elite remember. They don’t need krabs in this game at all....

WHERE IS MY LEGION

You'll get no argument out of me! Slavery, banana republics, proxy wars, etc all easily fall into the camp of "immoral" based on my description. Though I think it would be easy to show there are ethical ways to practice capitalism. Many people often conflate "capitalism" with some form of social Darwinism. There are no tenants of capitalism which state one must make every decision to maximise one's own benefit and all consequence be damned.

Two Questions:

1) Is it possible you could use a capital ship in a C5? If so would this save time with more DPS?

2) I have a tengu, can fly it well. If I were to do this, what hole type would you suggest C2?

It's hardly toxic to point out a low effort post.

You're being highly selective as to what his play style it and the things he represents.

I've tried to keep the amount of intel here reduced to what is needed for people to give it a try. I could ofcourse share all the ships and fittings I have, but its also fun to keep that to the person who tries to shoot me down ;)
---
An Astra would work out perfectly. Even a Raitaru or anything you can dock in helps. A fort takes a bit more effort to be taken down and the guns hit pretty decent. Also the damage cap of the fort requires a bigger team to camp your hole for a week.
---
It honestly seems like a design oversight that was made for simplification of systems at the time, and then just ignored for way too long.

I guess if nulseccers wanted to not have their area of the game shit on, they shouldn't have been blue donut farmville fags.

Good question!
---
I've thought about quiting Eve already a few times. The last time I was pretty burned up of being a CEO. It just took too much of my time and I felt too connected to the success of our corp. At that moment I've looked into others parts of the game and realized I've never properly done trading and manufacturing. This made me move to null sec for a year and I had some good fun there.
---
There are still a lot of other things in Eve that I haven't really tried yet. FW, LS pirating, join a merc corp or whatever. I might give these things a try in the future.
---
Usually I'm not the type of person that does the same stuff for years. I think I will hold it out here until the end of the year. If I really get bored I might join another WH corp with a strong EU presence. I've already looked at a few that might be interesting.
---
Agree game is way more livly then before blackout. I hope they will remove overview to get it even harder, just leave tactical overlay with vectors.
---
Wow such in-depth guide, thanks. Btw why do you think that passive gila is better than active? From my own experience (played both) passive is much more unreliable in terms of tanking than active. I mean you always can overheat shield boosters on dangerous spawn and get a lot more regen + blue pill is op. On passive you can only overheat adaptives so in critical situation you can get much more tank from active than passive.
---
P.S for example, lets imagine drifter BS spawn with neuts and disruptors, what should i do in that situation? If i focus disruptors neuts will neut me completely and kill after, if i focus neuts i\`ll get scrumbled by disruptor and die because BS will literally wreck me cuz i move on like 220 m/s velocity w/o mvd so i cant even get enough transversal to dodge BS shots...

It's definitely more casual than eve proper (for now) - there's no racial ship skills and i haven't found a skill that increases my powergrid yet - might be one of the advanced or expert ship engineering skills since the basic one increases cap
---
Fitting is also way more simplified at the moment. I can see it being a casual game for people who want to do the PvE side of stuff with the encounters (missions), anomalies, industry, mining, etc.

Frankly the numbers of people logging in means less  than quarterly revenu.  As of Q1 2019, they're still doing fine and on a upward trend.  When players stop  buying plex and letting their accounts laps into Alpha from Omega status - then you can  ask how does it feel.

people complain capitals applied to good to sub caps....... they shouldnt be there without logi?

with logi sub caps tank fine vs a huge total value of capitals......

remove cynos completly, and you remove all capital use. sub caps online, its too dramatic. the balance doesnt mean remove

Doesn't matter kristallnachte, If you have ever "debated" or had an off the cuff "discussion" with malcanis you would quickly find out 2 things about him.

1) he will argue that black is white despite everything pointing that black is black.

2) he is pretty retarded

A lot of the basic mechanics are the same (although dumbed down for mobile) - double tap in space to move in that direction, there's an overview, tap modules to activate them, etc... Also the actual galaxy map is, afaik, the same

But there's definitely mobile-QoL features like the ability to pres butan to automatically lock all lockable ships up to your max targets, guns will auto activate on your next target after your current dies (can be disabled), auto orbit on your current target (should be disabled it's annoying as fuck), etc.
---
TBH I was kind of losing interest before the changes. The haircut pushed me over the edge.
---
No, your narrative is: "I am having 'a lot' of fun right now, I think, reeee this means the blackout and cyno changes are good! Oh, thousands of people are not logging into the game because they stopped having fun? Well fuck them, their fun is not my concern. Either I do not give a shit if this kills the game or not, or I am so narcissistic that I truly believe my fun is the only proper fun in this game, soooo changes that 'improve' my fun--at least I am telling myself they do--cannot possibly hurt the long term viability of the game; and because of these things, I will intentionally overlook any evidence contrary to my narrative."
---
...yes...
---
That's my point. The highlighted recent area looks like the early '17 area on the chart.
---
Well just buy the whole month then ;)
---
Interesting parts are usually censored so i think that those minutes will be mostly censored.
---
Ok, first of all, you defeated your own argument because Nickelback is objectively bad, if you disagree you're wrong :D
---
Seriously, though, let me quote the case you made:
---
&gt;You can't even make objective claims that scamming is harmful, ever heard of 'cruel to be kind'? I can argue that teaching people to not get scammed is actually more helpful over a longer period of time and happens faster if you scam them. That even solves your harm vs. help definition of morality, so you have to agree with me now, right?
---
This actually still works great for my framework because we're still discussing "help vs harm". If you made a good enough case that the "scammer" example is actually moral because it has more boons than banes, then I may be convinced of it and agree that it is in fact a moral action. And just to clarify, I'm not claiming there is a "perfect knowledge" of morality, or any way to be 100% certain of a morality claim, but much like science we can use evidence and sound argument to determine whether a set of actions is moral or immoral assuming we can agree on what we're discussing. In my gravity example, first we must agree that we're discussing whatever force attracts things to other things. 
---
And yes, my premise is entirely dependent on the definition of morality I provided. If you agree with that definition then we can absolutely discuss objective truths about any given scenario. If you do not agree with that definition then we should be having a different argument. That's why I said I can use another word for it. We can discuss whether actions are un-schmiggeldipoop, provided schmiggeldipoop has the same definition in regards to "help vs harm". "Morality" is just a convenient and common term to describe the topic. 
---
As an aside - I don't think OP or his children are bad people, I'm really discussing hypothetical here. Though I don't get the impression OP would care what I thought of him or his children anyway lol. And I completely agree there is a way to disconnect IRL from IVR. I love playing bad guys. 
---
p.s.  Although it's hilarious this is happening on this sub, I have only respect for your initial reply to the "...you're wrong" guy. And although I didn't come here looking to have this conversation, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to discuss either. 
---
p.p.s It is entirely possible we are at an impasse that we cannot break through via reddit posts, but either way I'd like to thank you for the civil and enlightening discourse.
---
Thank you, I'm considering switching my school schedule around this quarter and adding some IT related classes. Though I might just be better of teaching myself with whatever info is out on the net for free.

Yeah, for example. But not only this one.

Education on how to read a post and not skip a part, also.
---
&gt;While nullseccers were fart sniffing themselves into a coma watching a rising MER destroy the economy at large, most wormholers have been practically begging CCP to nerf safe wormhole income and bring down blue loot income.
---
Yes, lets eliminate the ability to roll wormholes at all, so you cannot instantly close down any wormhole that makes your w-system less safe, and just roll wormholes until you get Delve/area you want to hunt.
---
Passive works for me better because the giant shield pool means I have more time at my disposal to burn the enemies. I translate EHP as "Time that my souped-up drones have to sit on the enemy BS and burn them". 
---
My last Gila, which died to a misplay and Drifter BS on tracking pylon in T4, had 17K shield HP (with only 1 extender rig, the current one has 3). Current one has over 20k. No implants.
---
For T3 and most T4 spawns, I never found enough cruiser spawns to be a problem for a passive fit. T3 won't take me to 50% hp before they die, in T4 they can go down to 35% but won't beat peak shield regen.
---
The only dangers in T3 that I've encountered were: Drifter BS that I don't put my drones on immediately, thus letting it gain back some health and extending the time it has to shoot me, and...mispiloting, I guess.
---
To sum up:
---
1. I think and it's been my experience that the passive fit simply makes your health pool so large that anything under BS size can only tickle you while your drones rip them apart.
---
2. With passive fit you have fewer priority targets to handle since neuts are lower threat (but still a threat), and can move into positions or make plays that active tank won't let you because of the cap issues.
---
3. It lets you run more types of abyssal deadspace with the same fit. In particular, you can run Kinetic sites to benefit from your Gila kinetic damage bonus; the thermal bonus does nothing against the Abyssal Firestorm effect.
---
The only Filaments I won't run with this are Dark (ship speed makes my drones and missiles cry) and Firestorm (because fuck armor multipliers on Sleeper BS).
---
Now to address your hypothetical Drifter BS scenario, since after all this is a spawn that comes up often:
---
* you're at spawn point and enemies are right ahead
---
* launch drones, and either move a bit forward to set them on the BS, on set them on the BS if you're already in range
---
* change direction left or right, wherever is further away from enemies, and burn away with MWD, perpendicular to BS shooting trajectory (watch high tier abyssal YT movies, you will see this a lot - they fly at the edge or even outside the edge of the play space)
---
* keep cruisers out of range until BS is down (this cancels both neuts and scrams)
---
* burn cruisers
---
You don't get to use your missiles a lot in this scenario, and that's fine.
---
If the BS spawn is Leshaks, the play is more or less the same. If the BS spawn is Sleeper, ignore until neuts are dead.
---
I want to briefly address your last phrase -&gt; you may think the low speed isn't helping but when you are MWD-ing with +500% signature radius, the Drifter BS might hit less often but it will hit for way more damage, so there is a tradeoff.

I don’t think companies have feelings.

Lol read the definition of morality please.
---
Hahahahahaha...
---
No wonder my s5 is incompatible .-.
---
Lol... Really?
---
They should just re-work the encounter surveillance units: -
---
* Cannot be anchored &lt;250km from other structures
---
* Cannot be anchored in any type of anom.
---
* No rats is system give ANY BOUNTIES AT ALL unless an ESS is anchored. (Concorde cannot verify you have ratted at all.)
---
* 100% of bounties go into the ESS.
---
* Whilst an ESS is anchored local is available in that system only. As soon as it takes damage and for as long as it is &lt;100% health, local immediately drops.
---
* Everything else the same as currently.
---
Nullbear who enjoys PVP, BTW.
---
Read the post before you answer to a small part of it.
---
There is a part of objectivity in morality, and there is a part of subjectivity.
---
You claiming that morality has zero rational in it is just stupid blabbering. It litterally means you have no education about what \*is\* morality and just refer to the literal definition without any idea of what this word actually means.
---
Spend 10 plex to scan this system instantly!

I see you are a man of culture, as well...
---
&gt;o input automation, no real money transfer.
---
Sure, until you try to match that up with the whole "the rapidly falling number if logged in players is not because of the chaos changes making people not want to play EVE anymore, its because CCP just forced all the bots to quit."
---
It's just a shame it doesn't connect to Tranquility. That would be AWESOME. But I guess due to hardware limitations smartphones require another universe. I can't see TiDi battles the scale of the PC game work.
---
tru
---
Pretty sure I just told you what morality is. Right and wrong is subjective, ergo morality is subjective. Feel free to disagree, although that would be objectively futile.
---
They banned two players already for posting videos to YouTube. Pretty strict on it
---
how you get a dog in your pod is beyond me, kinda hard to rub his nose in it when you live in the fluid.

Ahh I see you speak auto-correct

Hey look, a link that agrees with me. Do you know what relativism is? Because I don't think it means what you think it does :)
---
Oh look!
---
Another future failed project CCP will waste money on....
---
Yaaay...slow clap
---
TIL Brisc has a blue check mark. I knew there was a reason he was such a fucking retard.
---
Nestor would be better if you're going to go Amarr/Gallente.
---
Proteus is pretty terrible since the changes, definitely not a mission running boat.
---
Both of you just using Leshaks would make everything super easy.
---
isk difference isn't what is important.
---
What is important is the % difference.
---
hey, look, a link that explain why you are wrong, but you keep claiming nonsense because you only read the beginning and it's too  difficult to read the whole article.
---
Why am I not surprised ?
---
Yes a Goon would certainly know what wormholers do /s
---
You mean Inclination?
---
Another comrade falls to the soothing and sticky sweet lullaby of real life social interaction. RIP in pepperoni.

I for one will keep marching on. You people are the devil and your fiendish tricks are lost on me.

Well the imaginary fleet number bullshit is in full force. Apparently a normal stuka fleet is 500.
---
Quit your crying. Chaos Era is upon us. This will work perfectly.
---
Probably because surprise requires forethought.
---
I'm usually not very much into Eve themed art, but this is dank as fuck.
---
stratios lacks the punch, T3 are … well they have a  bit more and are more agile but still …
---
Just go with ravens, MJD and cruise is easy mode.
---
Stop, you're ruining the narrative!
---
but also requires a huge investment to mitigate the high amounts of risk.
---
Yea it's pretty cool.  I assume you cant in europe then?
---
Yes, this has happened. I am not making that up.
---
Smarter to just sit on the gate and let the triangles come to you.
---
Did you ever try placing any mobile depots on top of the area the Slasher was whenever you probed its location? I noticed a Nereus in Jita doing the same thing a couple weeks ago and some combination of mobile depots, resetting session timers and downtime was able to free it. I haven't been able to nail down the exact combination that works, but those three things seem to be integral in resetting the "sticky" ship to a warpable grid and allowing for its capture/destruction.
---
Widow used to be the best solo blops, but the ECM changes ruined it :(
---
You mean like the Caiman or one that’s exclusively drone boat?
---
And how at any point when there is a risk of significant losses, the server shits the bed.
---
The problem (and I'm new to the game so I may be mistaken) is that things were balanced around the existence of local. In wormholes the use of cloaks is an immediate go to, not because it's elite or skillful but because it reduces your risk significantly. You could use other wormhole properties to reduce your risk when you needed to operate without.
---
You remove local from null you get the expanded cloak usefulness  but without the other factors. This made cloaks too powerful against a standard ratting subcap or mining one. They went from knowing too much to having no idea if 3-4 cloakys were 3k from them eating a sandwich and singing Despacito before they pressed a button, blew them up, and pressed said button again and disappeared, uncatchable. Some went to caps, some left. Now the caps are going to leave. The cyno hasn't even hit yet and people are saying "f-it". And from a human nature standpoint it's predictable. Everyone mad they are leaving just refuse to see there is a problem.
---
When you do things the laziest way possible because it's easier for you, expect it to go poorly.
---
o7
---
Good to see you online my friend!
---
crying? whos crying? i love everything about blackout, its a step in the right direction for CCP and eve, a few choices need a little tweaking, but all in all its all great.
---
my post was about a thought of someone not whats actually in the game.  
---
If cynos were completely removed. (which to most simple minded folk would seem like the clear fix for capitals) it would cause so many issues in the game, and definatly destroy the game for many, capitals need BALANCING not removing. i doubt all the poeple that complain about capitals have never ever used one or benefited from one. new players need that stepping stone.
---
Personally i think capitals tank should not be so great, jump drives should be removed (no, not the same as removing cynos) and cost reduced down along with the changes im saying are good.
---
of course then isk making money would need to go up to fill the hole not being made due to capitals not just face tanking sites and mass mining entire asteroid belts solo.
---
I use hawks that cost 65m isk a piece
---
&gt;rankly the numbers of people logging in means less  than quarterly revenu.  As of Q1 2019, they're still doing fine and on a upward trend.  When players stop  buying plex and letting their accounts laps into Alpha from Omega status - then you can  ask how does it feel.
---
You have clearly not heard of the Citizens United Case: corporations = people. Ergo, they must have feelings.
---
TIL a 15% change is the same as a 33% change.
---
nowhere is safe in eve rofl
---
Join forces. make big memes
---
&gt; It should be very risky to make enough isk to fly capitals fast.
---
Wormhole space has about 1/6th the isk killed as null and about 1/3rd the isk printed before blackout, all with about triple the isk/hour.
---
to do darks?
---
Yeah
---
Wormholer thinking other types of space makes too much isk quickly with too little risk.
---
Thanks for the reply, hadn't thought of Nestor, looks as cool as Stratios, will add it to the list. Leshak looks cool too, wouldn't take too long to be able to fly either, albeit would take a bit longer to add extra ranks.
---
next steps...  
---
Moving alts out of Delve "to show my playstyle wasn't biased against goons, but nullsec".   
---
New titan injected alt in karmafleet.  
---
Explain to us what is the customary welcome package for turncoats in goons?
---
Oh... hi.
---
40.000 Is a gross exaggeration. Could have it start with one visible and per 10 that are docked, a second one becomes visibly docked. With say 10 slots in total.  
---
If all of those are seen as filled, you know that your enemy has 100+ Titans docked there, and thus safe to assume they moved a significant, if not all of their Titans over.
---
Or that CCP stopped their login promotion so marginal players don't log in every day anymore.
---
Citation still needed
---
You're right, the recent drop is a lot less.
---
Early '17 drops 31% and black out period dropped 15%.
---
you know what ? there is a definition you should look at.
---
It's psychopath. Look at it, ad go get some help.
---
Thanks for the reply, don't really have much in the way of shield skills, but could pick them up. I remember them being popular for missions when was playing last. Will have a look at what I'd need.
---
Dude...
---
Just wanted to send you some love with u/dwallenmun
---
How can y'all not be having fun? These changes have been nothing but great fun
---
I remember when open betas weren't the permanent state a lot of games stay in.
---
Why do PvE in a way that isn't even giving you the ISK though?
---
You can definitely sold level 4 missions in a Micro Jump Drive Dominix with sentry drones. Having an extra person on hand adds to your ability to tank since you can share reps and caps. T3 ships in combination with a Dominix also work, good for chasing stuff down, but keep an eye on your tank, and make sure to take down scramming ships first.  [https://eve-survival.org/wikka.php?wakka=MissionReports](https://eve-survival.org/wikka.php?wakka=MissionReports)  is a stellar resource for figuring out the proper order of ships. Make sure to spend a little time on tutorials if you're still iffy on tagging targets in Eve.
---
Hard, challenging and fun is what we really want as an eve player but that is a two way street the ganktards/plex to win guys shouldn't have it on easy street and that is what the black out has given them.
---
Not the most popular choice by far but I used to enjoy using a range tanked Raven and later on a Raven Navy Issue. If you really want to use a T3C then Tengu.
---
Uh : https://twitter.com/HilmarVeigar/status/1169675714121089025
---
Ok sorries
---
I too can make up numbers.
---
I mean wormholes make money but were not making enough to drop 30 titans on some dreads like frat did the other night. And farming in wormholes is more dangerous than farming in null. Yeah you can close holes or crit statics but that doesnt stop people from rolling into you. Null sec folk can hide in dead end systems with a shit ton of rorquals and supercarriers and all krab in the same system with a scout on the gate and a jumpbridge in system to bring in backup whenever you need.
---
Wormholes are more dangerous than nullsec so they deserve more income. If wormholes are so safe whys noone live in them?
---
More than one
---
Its.  Alpha.
---
Suggestions have been submitted for this already.  Recommend you join discord and submit your own!
---
Is it moral under your objective framework to label anyone who thinks you're a moron as a psychopath?
---
Are there rules on how the inclination is chosen? I'd expect the plane of the orbit to include both the ship and the object that's being orbited but that doesn't seem to be the case.
---
We can only live in hope.
---
Id say 3v1 is fairer than 5v2
---
all attempts to activate modules are put through an RNG generator to decide what happens
---
I'm kind of surprised it is handling 40 people in Jita.
---
Thanks for the link, I remember using it years ago, but had forgotten the name, will be invaluable! We are probably just going to mission when the two of us are available, as just something to do together when free. Think I may now be more sold on a BS, so may score the T3 off the list, the Dominix is great, I just aren't that fond of its looks tbh.
---
Yes, that sounds like a "better time" &lt;.&lt; Everyone likes getting a text message at 3 AM telling you to get up and save a collection of pixels. Oh, the good old days eh....
---
Imperium found new Anakin Skywalker
---
I'm still waiting for CCP to do literally anything to lowsec.
---
Thanks for the reply, did have a look at Tengu, but Raven would be more tempting if going down Caldari route, wouldnt take too long to get the skills either, at least to fly it, might suffer a bit with shield tanking before I can get my skills up higher.
---
Those are the numbers the graph shows.
---
8k from a few months ago to now is 21%.
---
The 15k at the start of '17 was 31%.
---
Did you even look at the graph?
---
The teleporting of caps instantly around the map had a lot to do with the playerbase quitting around 2013. I know because the vast majority of the corp I was in quit at that time due to it and few have returned since then.
---
It does. The orbit is directly around the object being orbited.
---
They just have a soft entry to it.
---
ESI : 
---
ESI is an API to interact with the eve server. 
---
It's basically a presentation in the swagger format of the data inside the server. Swagger presents the resources available, their structure, their parameters. eg it says that my the resource character/{characterid}/location is a "characterlocation" type, which contains the system id, the x y z position, etc. of the character {characterid}
---
The resources presented by ESI contain both authenticated paths and unauthenticated. Unauthenticated paths can be accessed directly, while authed paths need to follow authing process and can fail.
---
The resources can be accessed with any http client, basically once authed you just call the resource URL (that is, its path from the root of the server after setting all its parameters)
---
Why are they using freaking Discord for that? I don't want to chat, I just want to submit bug reports and suggestions.
---
Actually a big exodus happened before that, but was masked by all the players joining due to big battles.   Most people ignore the loss of a large segment of hisec, but they were important in terms of the bottom line for CCP.
---
When I was a noob many years ago. Getting shat on verbally in local was the rite of passage. How times have changed
---
Thanks a lot man, sounds like a good tactic, I definitely will try it next time
---
P.S Would you mind sharing your fit please? When i\`ll lose my current ship I\`ll try yours
---
How to not get reelected 101?
---
That's 7 am NY time zone.
---
Honestly you should look at this as a good thing. I don't think any video game deserves this type of investment.
---
What if EVE for some people is a game of Cowboys and Indians and goons are just the Indians. Maybe your the goodies maybe your the baddies either way Cowboys just want to kill you.
---
Like the login system atm?
---
alpha skillset : 
---
If you can inspect a character, there are at least two ways to know whether he is alpha or not : effective skills and training
---
 \- if his skillset contains skills that have different effective level and trained level, then he is alpha
---
 \- if his active skill training speed is +- half of his theoretical training speed, then he is alpha
---
 \- if he is training skill and beyond the skill limit, then he is not alpha
---
 \- if he has skills above the limit of alpha and no effective skill reduced, then he is omega
---
other than that, if he is not training and has no skill above alpha set, you can't say.
---
Did you look at it? Do you math?
---
What public school did you go to where 51,000 -41,000 is 15,000?
---
I'm guessing it's the same school where 32,000 to  22,000 is 8,000.
---
Also, learn what percent change is.
---
I thought vanq pilots had no friends.
---
Mine tell me they do.
---
whatever mister "I can do whatever I want", you'll grow up with time.
---
People do things that are fun in their spare time. That's the summation of what eve needs to be. There isn't some classic struggle or you vs me. If it's not fun, people leave. If it's fun, people stay or join. When you cater to 10 different play styles you are fortunate to have 10 different sub groups having fun. If you alienate or ostracize certain groups, they leave. The biggest issue is when there is cross over and large amounts of people fit into many of those groups and decide something isn't fun because of one or more of the play styles no longer being served and when those people leave it impacts wide segments of a game that isn't one dimensional.
---
Nickelback are absolutely above average musicians, and that is objective truth.
---
You kinda hit the nail on the head, because there is no perfect understanding of morality (or, at least one we can ever hope to find) arguing that anything is moral or immoral is kinda pointless, unless the entire point of debate is determining what each persons morals actually are.
---
Tbh I'm not even certain what we are arguing about, I was just being a pedant about using morality as a measurement of good or bad, and I can't resist having debates that make me sound like a first year philosophy student. I'd argue if anyone rational is engaged in the debate, then using morality is just gonna make you look bad, unless you're on a stage and trying to appeal to the masses, those fuckers love appeals to morality.
---
Yeah, on topic I'm pretty much with OP, scamming in EVE isn't inherently bad unless you start taking your online behaviour and applying it to IRL. Especially since I appreciate the ruthlessness of EVE, if you do something dumb you will be punished. Shit's fun. Getting upset that other people are doing what they consider fun in a video game is also just kinda silly.
---
I don't really think we're at an impasse as much as we're debating in circles because morality is stupid and I'm a pedant. I'm pretty sure I began this argument with only the thought "don't use morality as a basis for an argument" and that was solved the moment you decided to use help vs. harm. Still a little subjective but much more reasonable way to determine if an action is good or bad. Though that eventually ends is "greater good" discussions, which is another thing first year phil students love to talk about in bars.
---
p.s. I also listen to Linkin Park because they're amazing, your resistance is objectively futile.
---
They need to declare using a 3rd party communications software product to pass on intel as an exploit. It undermines Hilmar's attempt to cut down on the "Free Intel" Null Sec has established. 
---
Once Hilmar has returned Eve to the Good Old days when there were no Null Miners or PvE'ers due to the risk being not worth the reward, no response fleets ready to escalate a fight into anything noteworthy, empty Null systems for entire regions as the player count was too low, when fleets were around 20 players max and T1 battleships were the most expensive ships people risked loosing, then we will have the best version of Eve back.
---
Long hours of boring space, and then you try to shoo the cat off your desk and suddenly you're in a station.
---
Yeah its not like I drop dreads on your titans and supers almost every day.
---
CCP will care if, they aren't making as much money. 
---
question is are they making a loss something tells me not yet as returning player plus plex sale are equal to or more than the loss of subs.
---
next question is will the blackout continue to make money for ccp something tells me no.
---
the question after they start to lose money what will they do, I'm still thinking structure that can be attacked easy (ish) to kill
---
Ask judge, he knows
---

---
There were no miners or rattlers in null? When exactly was this magical time I dont remember it.
---
Bet you local chat will work in the app :)
---
I don't rat or mine - haven't ratted since we lived in Deklein and didn't really mine that much ever. My gameplay is more "*hunt the hunters*" style. To me killing krabs is like killing NPCs - just an easy mode.
---
&gt; it was a massive buff for hunter while PVE player only get nerf.
---
Yep. That's how nerfs work.
---
Krabs have had buff after buff. It's about time CCP threw the pvper a bone.
---
That said, I think I would prefer a delayed local rather than no local at all. But beggers can't be choosers I guess.
---
I was just telling someone that theres almost more content in home defense than at the war front.
---
lol at you burning out your prop and point in the first few seconds of that first engagement :p happens to us all
---
"Ban chatting in an mmo"
---
Probably the same public school you learned how graphs work.
---
Early '17 clearly goes from around 47k down to 32k That's 15k
---
Blackout period goes from roughly 37k to about 28k once you adjust for the fact that this chart ALWAYS shows a massive drop at the end because of how downtime information is calculated and the smoothing dramatizes it.
---
So on both counts, you're pretty wrong.
---
So, the CCP/CSM summit is now the new BBQ? 😂
---
Only one module can be activated at any given time.
---
I’m just curious if you read my comment at this point. Lamenting and hating goons in game is expected, encouraged even by our interest in content. Claiming that goons or null sec have a secret Cabal  over the game because they are the majority of the csm is silly. Bottom line is he recognized that this isn’t the case. He thinks they are over represented: no shit. But that’s not exactly how the voting system works. It’s not like there is a limit to the reps from whatever section of space.
---
The thing I like about blackout is that you no longer have the local spike that serves as a signal to roamers to fucking book it.  The uncertainty leads to more clashes.  It's great.
---
If CCP = Hilmar falling the shots we are all screwed.
---
:facepalm: #removeHilmsr
---
I won a week ago at last :p I'm going for a wait and see approach, with Brexit coming up fast I don't have time to play anyhow, and I was down to training skills just to have something in the queue.
---
Most of the AT ships are t2 faction/pirate ships
---
Less than there should be.
---
How much can you make from that and what ship should I use?
---
How does one get a code?
---
Ok troll bait. I never said that. 
---
Let me clarify. If they were either botters or afkers that's not the kind of person that deserves to be playing this game.  CCP even agrees. Heck, this community agrees. Before the blackout all we had were complaints about them. Now you want them back? WTF? 
---
You want to bot or AFK they are still in high sec. But it's obvious null players who preferred little risk for huge rewards are leaving. Again, not the kind of person who deserves to play this game. I love how you can paint that and spin into your mish of words saying anything I don't agree with anyone's gameplay if because it's not how I want them to play. 
---
That's not the case, pal.
---
Basically what every single poster who isnt a mouth breathing shitstack has been telling him for years now.
---
Improvements to the overview have been requested for a fair time. and will continue to be, until morale improves.
---
(There was a small update back late last year. And we're poking them for more. both small (moving militia up a couple of levels) and larger. )
---
Grr small alliances are dying
---
Exactly.  Only one t2 guristas frigate though, iirc.
---
November 2016 was the Alpha clone expansion.
---
So if you want to compare the drop off from that, to the drop off from blackout, well, good luck with that.
---
Also, if you were so inclined, you can go to eve offline and get the actual numbers.  I'll save you the time though, you're wrong.
---
Uhhhh those rorquals weren’t paying subs on 8 accounts. Maybe 1 or two
---
4 days of a social function and discussion....  
---
Exhausted...
---
Pick one.
---
&gt; I'm exhausted at the end of 4th day 
---
Good Goons win again!
---
Who u callin a neckbeard? It’s a goatee. Get it right.
---
another project to fail and drain resources from eve....... what is this the 4th attempt.....work on EVE make it work and grow the player base back up FFS.
---
But but but!!!..... *something*!!!???!!??
---
Let's take rorq buff.
---
They had 1 massive buff then it was nerf after nerf : Anomalie respawn nerf, excavator yield nerf after nerf, blackout, cyno nerf if I remember even the invul thing get nerf (it was something about targetting an asteroid or something)
---
Supercarrier ratting had 1 buff then it was nerf after nerf : Anomalie respawn nerf, can't warp away with NSA on, can't tether/dock while fighter are out, Signature nerf, blackout, cyno nerf.
---
I know both of them were powerful but if you look at other big income like c5 wh ratting or abyssal it's crazy, a single supercarrier will cost around 15 bil to setup + almost a year of training to get "dank" ticks while you only need a few of month of training a 5 bil 
---
 ~ to get a T2 dread ready to run those famous "1.5bil per hour", same for abyssal (even less isk invested or month of training if I'm not wrong). Sure both of them are hard gameplay wise, look at the WH IA how deep they are compare to nullsec (even that once you know how to run them it's easy) but their income are far better, don't have same nerf as nullsec have (T5 abyssal being a big joke from my point of view).
---
For me CCP should have increase difficulty in nullsec ratting like making more tackling frigate, more punishing mechanics, like if you bring a super/titan in those site an NPC dread with tackle and ability to 1v1 a super if not manage properly warp in, ofc it should have a very big reward (like in wh) but increase your chance to die, even against NPC (a brand new risk adverse + anti bot mechanic). Imagine such a spawn where you have to use Mobile depot to refit your super/titan in order to barely survive, a small gang passing by could easily get some super/titan kill while super/titan pilot could have even bigger isk/hour if done properly
---
any battleship that is good at killing triangles.
---
Not sure about profit.
---
Because of how they whine.
---
i dont see any 100+ Stuka Fleets
---
So you are saying....alpha clones being made better made less people play the game?
---
I'm not following.
---
I mean... I can do whatever I want. Does that offend you? For a guy who thinks there exists objective morality you sure are a hostile jackass, isn't that immoral or something? What does your bible say about that?
---
Hope not, the last thing EVE needs is more power creep.
---
I use campers for warpins. I dont have blue alts myself.
---
Bad bot.
---
Nah I think his complaint is not being able to have a reliable intel channel that tells him exactly where hostile roams is. Now he has to cloak a toon off a gate and d scan sometimes. Life is hard.
---
imagine thinking Pearl Abyss is a "private company"
---
You are the one claiming that would offend someone.
---
How ironic that you call me an "hostile jackass"  just because I pointed you were you are wrong.
---
Go back to school kid. You have no idea what you are talking about, and your post make litterally zero sense.
---
I'm blocking you because I'm tired of your bullshit. No argument, no idea, no education, no interest.
---
who?
---
&gt; Grrr Bots bad   
---
 Open phone to check if BC 5 has finished on a character you havent undocked from station with in a month   
---
 Complain about bots ruining the game. 
---
Ironicly reasonable things to be upset about. Frig pvp being the most skill intensive but being the first thing you fly and bots being a sweeping problem due to there being a market for illegal isk.
---
!remindme in 1 year
---
Haha 🤣 but ccpls my narrative
---
until it's scaled up
---
I will never understand why people are mad that a game 15 + years old have reach a point where most people use in game ships, it's like if you play wow and start to cry "Dev don't see everyone start to have 430 + ilvl and cleaning mythic 10 every weeks". Ofc we reach a point where EVE player have gather enough wealth/experience/time in this game to throw supers/titan all around the place (for PVE because PVP it's still rare, even under heavy super umbrella, most of the time simple carrier do the job for small/medium gang). Like when I left Nullsec, I brought a nyx and went on a roam with it trough enemy space, die like a dumb ass but did not care, had enough money around to still throw money somewhere else.
---
And for the " feel like thats the direction CCP is moving towards with these changes" Absolutely no.. Hilmar said recently he hate to see titan all around the place
---
Statistically I'm talking about those that left. And those being bot farms and afkers. Actual Eve players hasn't dropped much. Many of their alts stopped logging in. The rate of actual players leaving isn't as bad as everyone claims. And just to clear up... I don't give a shit how you play, but call me crazy if I expect an actual human being to be in front of a computer.
---
&gt;hahaha welcome to eve
---
&gt;nice armor rigs and shield boosts
---
&gt;mag stabs for auto cannons
---
&gt;get gassed spacejew
---
scan results is a spread sheet that can be operated with keys
---
God I love downvoting you.
---
I play both. Eve is still afk in nullsec u just gotta know how bro
---
Grrrrr I drop supers on Drakes
---
Grrrrr there’s no content and PCU is down
---
Goons have more isk to bribe with than i thougth
---
My previous opinions that didn't change:
---
- CCP has dropped the ball and allowed nullsec to become a low risk medium reward environment. 
---
- Nullsec should go back to being a high risk high reward environment.
---
- Blackout and cyno changes (not drifters) are high efficiency (low effort) attempts to achieve the above.
---
- Blackout inevitably reduces the amount of farming activity in nullsec (source: MERs) and some of this is good because faucets were out of control.
---
- I believe, if the data shows that blackout reduces the overall activity significantly, then CCP should reiterate on it. The reiteration should focus on making blackout conditions more friendly specifically to subcap farming, so non-capital linemembers aren't hurt. If we can distinguish capitals and bots from subcap linemembers then that'd be the best solution. I think there are ways to implement this. The game is not there yet though.
---
- If the data shows that blackout is significantly damaging to Eve, then CCP could hide this data from players or even CSM, but they wouldn't intentionally misrepresent it internally. CCP is a for-profit company. They won't ignore or misrepresent internal data. Also, nothing about this is about Hilmar's bonuses. 
---
Opinions that have changed:
---
- I suspected some null CSMs are there to further their tribes' ingame interests. Now I think 10/10 is just there because they love the game and want to provide input for its betterment.
---
- People told me CSM best operates with consensus. So I spent a considerable amount of time before the summit trying to convince fellow CSMs into my perspective of Eve. Trying to convince people over the internet is an almost impossible task. I just ended up annoying them.
---
- I now think it's best if we agree on facts and problems. But it's fine if we disagree on opinions and solutions. Disagreeing on solutions actually provides a better marketplace of ideas for CCP for implementation. So we all made our case, and it remains to CCP to make decisions on how to move onwards.
---
We're not having the same experience then, I feel like it's much easier than before
---
Can we post this garbage on the other sub?
---
Is it practical to try this without a multi-monitor setup?
---
It’s always been toxic. It’s ok though. It’s a special kind of toxic
---
Thanks man. What's the best way to keep your spot from looking too valuable?
---
I'm going to assume for a second that you're not just trolling, so I'm an idiot.
---
Wormholes make metric fucktons of money. The sites and how they play out is well known, fits to counter them are known, there is zero risk from the content itself. If I had to guess you're living in C3 at the highest and ya, you're not getting paid much. Take a look at [Rykki's Guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSbMMEBlM5BAFXldnnX3GDGfUp02OAuMznRljKkbpH4Ff3SyNTrkyEjHSJGkNJsDPqypSZw3sQmQ1Ta/pubhtml#) and you can see C4 sites paying out between 50-150mil in blue loot and C5s paying 150-330mil ISK. thats \*per site\* and blue loot meaning an NPC will \*always\* buy it at that price. a haven in null is worth \~40-60mil depending on your corp's taxes and battleship spawns. and before you say 'but null sites are unlimited' if you're not a damn scrub, you farm your static, not your home, and you too will have infinite sites to run.
---
Wormholes are \*not\* more dangerous than null. you \*cannot\* be hot dropped in a wormhole. if you crit your statics, and you pay attention to your probe scanner you will \*know\* the instant someone has rolled into you. you don't \*NEED\* local when you have that kind of instant, free intel.  
---
wormholers don't drop titans not because they can't afford them. its because mechanics dictate that they literally can't \*build\* them. if you could build titans and supers in wormholes, they absolutely would be there because they'd be fuck-off untouchable without \*excessive\* levels of effort (go ask INIT how much work it was to take down rage \*without\* supers/titans being involved)
---
No probs, hope it helps. Here's what to start off with, and where money can go for upgrades.
---
Low:
---
3x Drone Damage Amplifier
---
[as you make more money, these can be slowly upgraded to a combination of faction DDA and C3-A/C3-X Ballistic Control Systems, for more DPS 
---
My best fit ran 2x Imperial Navy DDA and 1x C3-X BCS due to fitting restrictions. I think 2 C3-Xs are the most you can fit and still use a MWD]
---
Mid: 3x Large Shield Extender, 2x Adaptive Invulnerability Field, 1x MWD
---
[upgrades here are deadspace invuls for that sweet 40%+ to all resists, faction shield extenders for more shield and better fitting. a better MWD will reduce the capacitor penalty which is of moderate usefulness]
---
High: 4x Rapid Light Missile Launcher, 1x Tractor Beam
---
[faction launchers would increase your DPS every so slightly, it's the last upgrade you want to make]
---
Rigs: I have run 1 Shield Extender, 1 EM, 1 Thermal but I think that overall 3x Shield Extender gives better results. If you want to experiment, I'd suggest fitting 3 extender rigs and switching out a mid slot extender for a type-specific hardener to compensate and not burn rigs.
---
Add Faction Medium Drones to match the Abyssal filament and a whole lot of Nanite Repair Paste. I always use Fury missiles because the missile DPS is only relevant on BS and sometimes cruisers, so application isn't a big problem. Don't recall if you can use T2 ammo as alpha.
---
Uhhhh....
---
So who is leaving and why? I'm all ears... patiently waiting your response in anticipation.
---
What narrative? The risks goes both ways lol
---
please source this reference
---
Quality shiptoast.
---
imagine being this assblasted about your perfect safety taken away after 5 years of infinite krab
---
\&gt; You basically arent going to find a high sec system without neuts in it
---
Lol.
---
That's the most naive thing I heard all day.
---
One more comment, I would not recommend anyone to live in a C5 solo if they haven't learned/played the game for at least 6 months. Even if you skill inject and put a lot of money into it, its a pretty difficult gameplay to learn all by yourself.
---
It would be better to join a newbro friendly wormhole corp if you want to give it a try. You could give 'Eve University' a try, see  [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying\_to\_EVE\_University](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying_to_EVE_University)
---
&gt; They had 1 massive buff then it was nerf after nerf
---
And they are *still* overpowered, imo.
---
I would argue that while WH income is kinda crazy, it's more dangerous (or at least has the potential to be). Not only is there no local, but you are stuck in place for 5 minutes, and you can't light the magical "I win" button to summon a bunch of supers at a moment's notice.
---
&gt;For me CCP should have increase difficulty in nullsec ratting
---
I agree with you, honestly. It'll still be farmed like crazy, because if there's one thing eve players are good at, it's minmaxing the fuck out of krabbing. But right now null PVE is stupidly easy.
---
Anyone who thinks pvp should be mainly hisec dueling
---
20 J away
---
Nah im just gonna explore a bit in there got a nice and friendly mid sec beginner corp
---
Do you not even read your own posts? You're a hostile jackass because you're resorting to name calling, if you want someone to agree with you then maybe you should hold views that are correct or learn to argue a little better.
---
It was nice talking to you though. xx
---
This is a stupid question but can you go into the process of rolling holes a bit more?
---
1. What does it take to do?
---
2. What is the goal? Ie, what makes you decide to start rolling a hole and when do you stop?
---
ELI5 is fine because I've never gotten this part.
---
1) calling everything a bot isn’t an argument worth acknowledging
---
2) plex comes from real money period
---
Did Hilmar just get appointed CEO? No so your statement doesn't hold up
---
Alpha rorquals?! :o how can i get in on this
---
The introduction of alpha clones. as in the introduction of F2P.  If you want to compare the number of people who quit playing because of chaos or whatever, to the number of people who tried F2P, then decided eve wasn't for them, that's not going to be a great look.
---
Also, since you're just looking at the graph, you're missing that the area you are talking about includes the holidays, which have some pretty significant swings in logged on players, which the 5 year graph doesn't really indicate. You're comparing the holiday season with the start of summer.
---
I mean, whatever. I get that you don't really do facts or logic when they conflict with your agenda, and trying to point out facts and logic is a complete waste of time with you.
---
Get a life
---
hmmm... what are dreads and titans doing typically when you drop dreads on them?
---
Damn people and their living in other timezones
---
I don't know where you guys got this idea that I rat or mine but it's quit comical - like I literally don't even know what damage to tank vs. Delve NPCs
---
Is selling PvP stuff like ammo and paste in FW areas a good way to fund more frigates?
---
That’s the thing, the VAST majority of people i knew were just casually waiting for their omegas to end then stopped playing.
---
it’s coming into the third month of “chaoooooos” and... ironically.... as the subs finally end the playercount is in freefall
---
Think I found someone who bot farms his apartment rent. Null is balanced now. WHs had blackouts all along and most left. Quit whining, you baby.
---
2003 -2004, Null sec was virtually empty. Very little areas of Null were even visited on a daily basis. Majority of players were High/Low sec.
---
Who knew “gtfo you aren’t welcome if you don’t LOVE my ideas” wasn’t a great business model...?
---
Severe risk of getting an Ulcer from the gallons of coffee you consume during a meeting marathon though.  
---
Not to mention the stale sandwiches that always end up on the table.
---
Does this count as multiboxing?
---
Most battleships can happly do level 4s. Whats best depends on who you are running the missions for. For example minmatar security agents typically give you alot of angel missions. So a ship thats good at killing angel rats would be ideal.
---
What about blackmail, extortion and forgery?
---
So... you want eve to be a giant empty nothing with nobody farming and frigates shooting each other?
---
you know you can just go buy elite dangerous... actually that seems too grindy for you 
---
You can just buy Call of Duty or play fortnight
---
Well at that time, naturally, yes. The universe had just been born.
---
The money doesn't matter if the act kills the game. They are discouraging 50 rorq alts even though it is in their short term interest to keep them. They suckled the test for too long, as have many of us.
---
It's more about teaching them how to recognize when *they're* being scammed IRL
---
If this is the only problem you encountered, than it seems its a very solid game for a mobile device.
---
facts are NAIVE to you?  Good god you must think feelings are mature and the best thing to obey at all costs and that’s scary
---
If the characters not logging in are alts or bots, then the lower number is a good thing
---
You’re wrong and this complacent attitude is pushing things to a bitter end
---
Anyone with a few brain cells know that a person living in a C5 has at least a few billions in ships. Now a few billion is a lot for a new rookie corp, but not really special for a large wormhole group. Imagine that you need to split 5B between 10 persons actively camping a hole for a whole week, 24/7. 500M a person. I got more with 45 minutes of ratting. So doing it for the loot is not really a huge win.
---
I think going out with a 10B Rorqual or dual rat with 2 heavy fitted dreads will get me camped within a few days. I would even camp a hole and shout-out to some friends if I would see that in my static. Once in a while you run into a few old null bears that think its a good idea to do this. Usually they loose their shit pretty quick and decide to move out again.
---
Just keep it low and simple. I've got 3 nestors and some cheap-fitted Domi's for rolling the holes. A few scouts and some hauling ships. Currently have 4 structures and a POS that I can online. The timers of the structures are set in different timezones and on different days. So a corp with only a EU or only a US presence will not be able to evict me. And if they do, in the last month I've made enough ISK to replace my whole investment here. 
---
Good question, thanks!
---
You realize EVE was fine before belts full of Rorqs?
---
&gt; In wormholes the use of cloaks is an immediate go to, not because it's elite or skillful but because it reduces your risk significantly
---
while traveling and scouting, yes. otherwise it just benefits people who hunt for targets since there isn´t really anything you can do in whs while cloaked. just as in any other kind of space. people tend to use it because people in whs actually use D-scan as an intel tool to compensate for the lack of local. so a cloak really doesn´t do much to reduce risk and there is no mechanic in WHs (besides roling your static - or lets call it controlling entry points to your system) that wouldn´t be available in other kinds of space players as well.
---
People fighting together op... uh... i mean TOO SAFE :((((((( ccp why can people work together omg nerf now its too SAFE for them to work together”
---
Yeah. It’s almost like it’s fun to work together, more efficient to work together
---
And go fucking figure those who don’t do that won’t win
---
Bullshit Spinner
---
Have you ever spent entire days in a conference room and left energized?
---
olmeca's been flipped lol. guess even flat earthers have to reconsider there stance when they see the facts on the ground.
---
&gt; I believe, if the data shows that blackout reduces the overall activity significantly, then CCP should reiterate on it. The reiteration should focus on making blackout conditions more friendly specifically to subcap farming, so non-capital linemembers aren't hurt. If we can distinguish capitals and bots from subcap linemembers then that'd be the best solution. I think there are ways to implement this. The game is not there yet though. 
---
Its iterate btw, re-iterate just means do the exact same thing again.
---
And lol at the belief that CCP will actually iterate on anything. History has proven that to be folly, and nothing suggests that anything has changed in that regard
---
Yeah. Most of it is just orbiting. I have 3 monitors but I run all my eve clients on one because it’s easier
---
Someone is paying for that plex so it’s better actually for ccp if you sub with plex
---
ah yeah, back when sov warfare was fun
---
Thanks for the reply, predominantly been running Federation Navy and Sisters of Eve missions. I will have a look into the evesurvival guides to work out what faction they are fighting.
---
It does work.
---
Hmm, looking at login stats or ships destroyed, EVE was at an alltime high in the years of 2013-2015, the tiericide-patches (overhauling T1-Ships and tiers and implementing Ships like Tier3-BC and Tier3-Destroyers) did a great part in this. The roaming and brawling meta was at its top looking at numbers, and large NPSI-Projects being born at that time because of that, like Spectre.
---
Scamming in EVE or any other adult-oriented MMO where it's accepted/expected/condoned is one thing. Scamming in a game designed and marketed to under-age children is something else. Ruining some eight-year-old's day for empty lulz (while you wait for the ban to hit) is just kind of shitty all around: \[be excellent\]( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rph\_1DODXDU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rph_1DODXDU)) instead.
---
Why you care so much, its just a game. In the end everyone lose some monies and life span
---
Fuck that. Keep the blackout, lose the bots and the bears. Nothing of value lost.
---
what does it even mean?
---
Viel Spass. Du kannst uns mal in r/de besuchen!
---
Is Eve: Echoes still accepting applications for the closed alpha?
---
Pretty sad, i've started EvE, peak hours were about 30 k...
---
Look, as a wormhole diver, I LOVE sneaking up on ratters, don't get me wrong. But I want this pond stocked with fish!
---
Feel free to downvote me all you want, i have enough imaginary internet points
---
&gt; TitanTians
---
Do we have an r/EveOutOfTheLoop?
---
well umm I think all of those nullsec CSM members consistently participate in small gang shit of 10 or so except maybe Aryth who plays the game like its a bloomberg terminal
---
Do I think t will stop umbrellas totally? No. People can still easily defend their space with caps. However, it stops carriers and supers from have a “I need help button” without any risk to them. Now I can force them to burn a cyno with either a blops or a recon which an both be easily killed and then extract or I get to kill a carrier.
---
I spent 5 years doing it 12 hours a day or more, 6 days a week. The only times I was exhausted was when it was when I has to pass down hard to swallow changes for all of my stores.
---
I do not believe I remember a time where the player base felt that sov was fun.
---
If their character has no skills above alpha he technically wouldn't have access to any omega tools anyway as all omega items are unlocked through skills right? I think this would be acceptable for my corp. For example my character is still omega for the next 9 days but this wouldn't give me an advantage over an alpha at the 20mil sp cap since I have made a point not to train above alpha skill caps.
---
I think I'll use the data from ESI to do an initial check when recruiting someone new and then pull it up again for damage control if I think someone had upgraded to omega and is abusing our metagame. Hopefully this will be easy enough to manage.
---
CCP get rid of the net worth calculation in character sheet. Trust me on this.
---
I mostly understood this but I don't speak the language. Do you know of any free online courses where I could learn the fundamentals of this stuff? If not I might look into IT related classes at my community college.
---
Hi, this is not a stupid question. Everyone that jumps into wh's need to learn this!
---
First there are different types of wormholes. Some are bigger, some are smaller. Some allow you to jump in with a capital, some only frigate sized ships. 
---
Now check  [http://www.ellatha.com/eve/wormholelist.asp](http://www.ellatha.com/eve/wormholelist.asp) . You see a lot of wormholes types. Once you are on grid with a wormhole, check the name of the wormhole in this list. Lets say you found this one  [http://www.ellatha.com/eve/wormholelistview.asp?key=Wormhole+H296](http://www.ellatha.com/eve/wormholelistview.asp?key=Wormhole+H296) . 
---
 **Max Stable Mass**: 3,300,000,000 kg
---
 **Max Jump Mass**: 1,350,000,000 kg 
---
Its good to know that the mass of a wormhole is 10% below or 10% above [3.000.000.000](https://3.000.000.000). This is why above its mentioned as max stable mass [3.000.000.000](https://3.000.000.000) kg. So it could also be 2.700.000.000.
---
A wormhole has 3 stages from fresh to almost closed. It says 'reduced' when its on 50% and 'critical' when its damaged for 90%. 
---
A normal battleship is around 100.000.000 kg in mass. If you put your micro jump drive or after burner on, it becomes 150.000.000. If you put a higgs anchor on it, then it double the mass.
---
If I jump a fresh hole with 5x 300.000.000 battleships, it could be reduced (hole is smaller than [3.000.000.000](https://3.000.000.000)) or  not yet reduced (hole is bigger tan [3.000.000.000](https://3.000.000.000)). 
---
Let's say it reduced so this is a small hole. It could be 2.700.000.000 or 2.999.999.999. I don't know so must play it a bit safe. 
---
I jump in with another 300.000.000 and check the hole. It should now be around [2.100.000.000](https://2.100.000.000), so still safe. I can jump in another 300.000.000 to get in total to 2.400.000.000. I jump one higgs fitted ship out without micro jump drive, and will now be at 2.600.000.000 in total. If this indeed was a 2.700.000.000 hole, I can close it with my last ship I've in there.
---
These are just the basics of rolling a hole. Once you understand these mechanics, you can think about how to roll a hole that already had some mass of other players without knowing how much went through. 
---
Fly safe out there!
---
My old 24h gym had a Chipotle and a Five Guys on the opposite side of the street, just when you exited the mall. Was brutal.
---
There's an email as well...
---
Literally right in your invite email.
---
&gt; If we can distinguish capitals and bots from subcap linemembers then that'd be the best solution. I think there are ways to implement this. The game is not there yet though.
---
Just port incursion sites into null exactly as is but with renamed rats. 
---
- subcaps only, since site is gated by an acceleration gate.
---
- more complex and thus harder to bot.
---
- a harder target for gankers to attack since they have a pre-defined landing spot that also decloaks instead of being able to dictate range from the start in a cloaky ship. Also attacking a pre-organized fleet that has logi and likely a Vindicator/Web Loki.
---
- encourages using ships other than frigates, since defending against frigates in a room is easy (Approach beacon, smartbombs on)
---
- Supercap response can only prevent additional gank ships from entering the site. To save the fleet in the site itself you need a subcap response fleet bridged in.
---
Have like each constellation spawn one 10 man site with an income multiplier based on truesec. Once the site is complete it spawns the next site in any system in the constellation. To get there you take gates since fatigue would build up build up very quickly. Now you have more gate traffic and more gatecamp targets.
---
This also addresses nullsec isk faucet since incursion payout includes LP, which is an isk sink.
---
Well, more fun than it is now and had a reason for it to happen.
---
Weapon functionality is now tied to local chat.
---
Sorry to hear he’s no longer working with you. Would that mean you can’t use his concepts for the ships if/when you put them in-game, or are they still going to look like this?
---
Mind linking your killboard?
---
I would suggest bring back local (via observatories) but have it as a delayed local. Like the local refreshes after  a minute for -1.0, 30 seconds for -.1
---
its on my list! this templar one is amazing and as an audiobook more still.
---
I don't hate CCP, it's more that i'm disappointed with them. Not just for being bad at crafting Eve, but also for being poor business men and having no loyalty to their fans. But no one deserves to be stuck in a room with Olmeca for more than a few minutes. I wouldnt wish that fate on my worst enemy
---
CCP is obviously tracking every single statistic they have (which are plenty more than that one, as has repeatedly been said) and will probably compromise between full local and blackout with a new set of structures to be announced soon.
---
Bears will calm down and go back to krabbing with a little more risk than previously, the rest will be relatively happy (as much as an EVE player can be at least) that NS is no longer krabs paradise and find ways to fuck other's structures and other changes, and EVE will go back to dying as always.
---
Most likely outcome is that those structures are gonna be somewhat fuckedup, and everyone will scream about it, they'll tweak it but not enough and then we will move into bitching about whatever change comes next.
---
Circle of EVE life.
---
PCU 👏IS 👏 NOT 👏 A 👏 GOOD 👏 METRIC 👏
---
to be fair, activity is kinda low as usually we got wars this time of the year,  or a build up to one.
---
right now, ,its the opposite.  wars feel more pointless than ever in EVE's history.
---
That nosedive on ships destroyed though, I thought blackout was gonna male eve more dangerous! What went wrong???
---
Well no shit, that is why i specified _right now_.
---
I'm not really keen on joining the discord so i generally just submit via other channels
---
They forgot to account for people being total fucking pussies.
---
Well, it does give you isk... Just not in the real game lmfao
---
^(WTB good MMO)
---
This ++ :)
---
Mobile games in 2k19
---
You're better than me then. I'm more exhausted after a full day design meeting then I was after 12 hours labouring on solar farms when I was younger.
---
anecdotal
---
Would using eveskillboard allow me to access all of this info?
---
It would make my corps skill data public if I understand correctly? I don't think this would really matter though since if I disable jump/clone+implant and standings info it wouldn't reveal anything that my corp details don't already disclose.
---
God bless CCP fixing isk faucets
---
&gt; Arm processors are way lower great and energy costs, and the PC's will likely be on Intel predecessors. 
---
What is a "way lower great"? And predecessors? Did you mean processors?
---
Highly suggest the tomahawk b450 board, msi I believe. Literally a breeze to work with.
---
There stupid fozzieaov, rorq changes that killed the market and pheobe jump changes killed the game long ago.
---
It probably comes down  to how engaging the people and source material is/are. A lot of conferences that are just the sort to let top line management feel justified discussing numbers and reports can indeed suck.
---
If your good at working together then what are you upset about? You should be just fine under the new mechanics.
---
What happened to sleeper components? Have they simply been removed from the MER?
---
Experience
---
In my defense, I didn't start the fire, just poured a little gas on it.
---
Way lower heat.
---
Sorry.
---
And yes processors.
---
Dang, we only lost 0.3T ratting bounties in Delve from July to August. Considering that the blackout didn't start until July 12th(+/-?), that's pretty crazy.
---
Mining went off a cliff, but that's not surprising given the infeasibility of safeguarding excavator usage without local. I'm very amused by Domain being the #2 mining region. That's entirely off of the backs of moons, I'd wager.
---
Thanks for the update! I was just confused
---
I sat cloaked on grid watching somebody rat until they boated close enough for me to uncloak and point them, it wasn't particularly shiny but it was pretty damn satisfying. I think i like blackout now.
---
My main point is that this isn't really that bad. It's still within many common swings EVE experiences.
---
Oh no, we're 2k less than 3 years ago! Terrible...or whatever....the sky is falling I guess.
---
&gt; Nothing of value lost
---
You heard it here first folks, content doesn't matter
---
On the other hand we have the reeeeing blocposter who thinks you need to have at least 15 rorq alts to even be considered as someone who plays the game lmao.
---
Something has to be broken. But if we take the delta from the other two since the graph equals 100% then its supposed to read 60.3% Up from 54.7 last month.

Less than 200b mined in fade, dek and branch combined. LOL
---
Depends on a bunch of factors. It's easier to sneak up on enemies since blackout, but over the last weeks more response fleets have emerged. Have you fought a response fleet yet?
---
Mining Value in Providence:

July: 1.144 B

August: 122 B

Depending on how this could be done, CCP could ban people circumventing the rules.
---
People didn't rely on it to play the game.
---
Null relied on it to be worth living there.

Maybe Hilmar will somehow allow players to be killed while docked. ChAoS ErA

You told them to adapt or die. They didn't die according to the graph, looks like they adapted

Does anyone know the reason for[ the drop in the transaction tax](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/7qv7bx2vXYthJH9vUH0lli/e0326b545c4e359b6f27257d40c3541d/9aaa_top.sinks.faucets.over.time.png) isk sink?

Oh yea, that fucking travesty. Good point.

Except when he will get fited cause no money.

Remember 2 years ago. They fired a lot of people and there were IG a lot more people.

Yeah you can tell from the peak concurrent players map that null is completely dead now.

I mean I haven't looked at it but I'm sure that's what it shows.

I lost EVE to join a wormhole corp and krab in a regular C5, thinking the ISK/hour was so dank compared to the days of L4 blitzing in high-sec when PLEX was singular and only 500m. I triplebox Nestors just like you, plus a cloaky scout/haul alt; hit a little less ISK/hour than you, probably 300-400m without Drifter and not counting setup time for scouting and rolling.
---
Well, after trying out Abyssal Deadspace I realized I could be hitting the same krab output with basically no fucking investment and thus no risk. It's 500m ISK/hour with 200m ISK investment, on so little SP pilots you just need the 1m from referral and 1m from $5 Starter Pack DLC, plus no need for a fourth alt to watch wormhole activations. The answer is tripleboxing fleet T4 Dark Abyss with Hawks, and if you aren't a scrub like me you could move up from T4 to T5 to like 1b ISK/hour, which is comparable to C5 dread sites.
---
I suppose since Hawks are like 200 DPS and Retributions can hit 400 DPS with Multifrequency, tripleboxing those in T5 Electrical Abyss could get near 1.5b ISK/hour. That's a subscription an hour, y'all, and about the same as how much you have on the line if you wipe.
---
You could hit around that same rate with a Rorqual (not kidding) and 2 DPS shield battleships in C5/6 sites, but that's like 3b ISK on grid at least, plus that Rorqual is going to be the African American of this horror movie. Each Retribution could get down to as little as 300m ISK and even for T5 Hawks could be as cheap as 100m ISK each. And let's not forget you can do Abyss next to the new Jita renovations and don't have to roll holes or haul.
---
I do wanna hobo-squat in a shattered C6 with a Rorqual if I ever leave this corp, maybe move up to triple dread once I can buy dread alts.
---
the slope is real
---
They increased it.
---
That's an increase, not a drop.
---
* The EVE universe is going to get an 'uninhabitable environment' mechanic that may influence how players hold systems.
---
* Some resources (possibly new) are going to be critical to production but their scarcity factor dialed up to 1000
---
* They are going to introduce a much larger class of warships for players to build (probably at the scale of the Trigivalin world ship thing), because clearly that's going to help solve SuperCap proliferation and be "more harder" to build than Supers.
---
Assuming these guesses are true, then CCP truly is dumb as fuck.
---
Hmm will have to check it out!!
---
Looks like all the lines are on a downward trend; doing God’s work ccp... fuckin the game up
---
&gt;Please feed ratting ship kills until you run out of money.
---
Both seem like acceptable answers. The problem isnt why, it's that they want it to seem like something more than what it is.
---
Yes, thank you, this guy fucking gets it.

You are a god
---
&gt;  the drop in the transaction tax
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/pvewgz/updates-to-sales-taxes-and-brokers-fees
---
Keep in mind a "drop" in a sink means it's gotten sinkier.
---
Ah, thanks!
---
Yes.  You can make a lot of ISK running sites with a Dread.  For a Tengu you'll want to live in something with a C3 static.  You'll be better off if you cross train into a Rattlesnake for site running.
---
It's an increase actually since the graph is negative there.
---
You have to type the word "pew" every time you want to fire
---
Eve offline has never had a better name than now.

---
Judging by that, Wormhole sleeper loot injected 14.3 trillion while null rat bounties pumped 17.3 trillion. Wormholes now inject 80% as much isk as null.
---
Also for the first time ever on the MER commodities passed Ratting bounties to become the #1 isk faucet.
---
You can also go full circle and hunt hunters. Be on grid, let them take damage, then point them and take em out. Here's my best one so far: [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77818563/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77818563/)
---
This is fine...
---
People were reliant on chat to avoid getting PVP'd at.
---
Problem is, people were also reliant on chat to know where people were to PVP. 
---
Instead of knowing where gangs or fleets are roaming around, everyone is playing marco polo. 
---
I still liked the idea of having constellation chat instead of local per system. It's [become evident](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/7qv7bx2vXYthJH9vUH0lli/e0326b545c4e359b6f27257d40c3541d/9aaa_top.sinks.faucets.over.time.png_w=900&amp;fm=jpg&amp;fl=progressive) that the old notion that removing local would 'fix' cloaky camping by players not knowing there is a cloaky camper there. 
---
Maybe players will adapt, but I at least hope CCP is looking into other options.
---
Man you're living the dream I want to live in eve -- I've been slowly working towards it, even.
---
My GPU just died on me so I can't really play, but I'm currently holed up in a C3 soloing it in a rattle. There's a free structure that the owners make available to anyone, that I've made my home in. A little more crowded than I like, but I didn't have to pony up for the structure. :)
---
Do you think if one had 2 omega accounts (and 1 alpha for scanning, 1 alpha for jita) they'd be able to tinker rattle (or RR nestor) a C5 on my own? With my own structures, etc.? I'm currently on one account, but considering expanding my reach...
---
Any other tips / fits / advice / etc. for someone doing solo C3 life looking for C5 life would be appreciated. :)
---
New? That's how The Judge was flipped.
---
I dont mind about afk player. It s more kill.
---
What is the jsig of the system you are in?
---
These are textures I believe there are a few other "structures" with different textures applied.
---
Did I say I quit? I know your reading comprehension isnt very good. 
---
You are beyond retarded if you think less players are good for the game
---
i've noticed the same shit but on the other side of the coin, just yesterday saw some code aligned people ganking a fenrir in Uedama and when the ship was bumped at proper distance they warped in a fleet of catalysts all named the same but with different numbers. and after killing the freigther one of them broadcasted a message on local automatically. 
---
reported some of them for botting/input broadcasting/whatever, i dont give a damn about your new order scam but this should require actual human interaction not have 200 alts mounting destroyers warping at the same time and then leaving automated messages on chat.
---
And while rolling is, IMO, too easy, its also at least somewhat dangerous. We killed a rolling meg last week. I mean, that's only 250m or so, but still.
---
Note that EVE Uni has all the security mission reports from EVE-Survival https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Mission_reports
---
I think practically all L4 missions have been formatted for new wiki but some may still be unformatted.
---
Exactly, and I by no means know how to rectify the situation in a balanced way without hitting another part of the game. I will say it's a result of "we will balance it later" mentalities. And while they may not like being janitors and cleaning up intellectual debt, they have so much debt that more simple minded changes were bound to exacerbate the situation.
---
Finally venture bots can’t sit in plexes.
---
Ok that makes sense but why would you roll a hole? I assume that you are rolling it so that the other end is in a place you would like. Say for example your hole terminates in a null sec capital. I assume you would roll it till it comes out somewhere that is empty so that no one comes in and bothers you. 
---
Is this accurate? If so what decision tree do you use to evaluate the risk of the hole terminus?
---
For the past year or two, demand for plex has gone up because it was so easy to farm isk in null, so people stopped paying with real cash and started plexing their accounts. Just because demand goes up, doesn't mean supply also went up, it didn't. This is why plex has been on the rise for so long.
---
Unless all the null Krabs are buying Plex with real money, CCP isn't making more money. The people who buy Plex with real money are the pvpers because they don't want to krab for isk. This is why, after the blackout begun, all the Krabs got angry and quit, and all the PvPers came back because they love this change. Coincidentally, Plex prices have been dropping because supply has increased (more people buying Plex with real cash) and demand decreased (all the raging krabs). No way in hell a pvper in their right mind is going to pay for their PvP habit AND try to Plex 3+ accounts, that's just insane.
---
 So TL;DR: PvPers are better at putting real money into CCPs wallet than Krabs are.
---
I imagine SNUFF dreadbombs might have something to do with the lack of Rorqual mining.
---
Wasnt this flying world arks be a thing In the lore before like the thukker one ?
---
very nice interpretation
---
What ships have been lost?
---
Long live the blackout.
---
God, some of those UI features should be implemented on PC too I think. Like guns automatically firing on your next target.
---
No worries I'll be as zealous as ever. Just recalibrating some of the believes I held.
---
If you roll all the holes, you have a few hours an isolated system, pretty safe to make some isk. As soon as a new sig pops up, you might not be alone anymore.
---
My alliance has been openly saying on comms that one of the best ways to find content is to rat or mine until a wormhole fleet rolls through, and then fight them.
---
You are correct my DinoBro.
---
Using CSM to play the meta a screw over alliances/players is not something I support.
---
I'm pretty sure it is actually that bad. If you've convinced yourself otherwise, you're not looking at the data objectively.
---
Alos, we're down 2K over the January - September time frame last year, let alone 3 years ago.

(In case this reads like sarcasm, irony, etc., it's not.)
---
They banned near 7,000 accounts for voting and RMT in August (as per the security report that was just posted).
---
I think we’re doing okay with the blackout.
---
&gt; lose the bears. Nothing of value lost.
---
People leaving the game, regardless of what activity they enjoyed doing, is bad for the game and bad for all of us.
---
I wish all you fucking single digit IQ troglodytes would fucking understand this.
---
Dreads don't really kill rorqs better than 100 bombers do, the difference is that the GOTG supercap/capital cover is not decisively bigger than snuff's.
---
CSM wasn't monolithic in the solutions they proposed. I just concluded with that we identified problems for them and gave them the marketplace of ideas for solutions.
---
Lose the bots, KEEP the bears
---
Generally good ideas.
---
Abyssal loot also sells to npc buy orders. Is that being included along with blue loot here? Because that would explain why blue loot is so large
---
RIP Cyno 2005-2019 you will not be missed
---
If any other MMO saw one of their economic indices crash to a third of it's former self without a proportional rise in other activities they'd be in panic mode trying to fix what happened.
---
Not CCP thou.
---
There is a button on every station you can press for a free corvette starter ship.
---
The FW bots will just use something different now. There's been a lot of Tristan bots too.
---
The clashes that do occur are somewhat anecdotal. If you're in a busy alliance and had access to the intel you'd see there's shit absolutely everywhere. And the reality is the vast majority of them are not actually interested in a fight. Most people want the free easy kills without the risk, a lot of people are sweaty nerds that's just the way it is. You can try baiting people but most of the time you just get ganked so of course the obvious response to that is to gank them first. But then you get shit for doing that anyway. And I mean the fights that do happen are great don't get me wrong. But do you know how much bullshit the defender has to go through before actually finding anybody fun? When you've got the fiftieth person show up in the last six hours. He claims he wants to fight. He doesn't and just shoots AFK miners. You beat him and you're a krab for using an unfair ship. You bring something his size and then you get ganked. So you gank and then you're a krab again. Or he just cloaks up and wastes your time. And you have to go through that five to ten times for each actual fight you get. People get tired it's understandable.
---
Aye, I’m being too optimistic :( 
---
FW blackout..

Actually no this is good

Where is this button located?

They have to hide how wormholers are the true krabs.

Good, we print less ISK now.
---
Agree with the O.P’s experience. Over half my attacks when solo roaming now end when the response fleet starts to arrive on grid. They all seem to be in fleet and on coms which is a good thing (for them at least, not so great for me!).
---
Yes, but since people drop less caps it's manageable

I love all the little KF spodbrains screeching about wormholes with zero idea how they work, it's so cute :)))

I would expect a salty guy like you to fly fits like this https://zkillboard.com/kill/76880816/

In theory, perhaps, but none of them have ever been tried.

Triglavians in Lowsec, might be fun

The ‘casual player’ can happily play in high sec or low sec if they want a safer environment.

Covert cynos aren’t being removed. They are just not allowing JFs to use them as was previously stated.

Red tags fall under other. Sleeper blue loot is explicit.
---
Is this on the test server? if so they did some announcements about how Jita 4-4 is having renovations done for expantion. iirc it came from an lore post recently.
---
So how easy would it be for me to find your hole with no prep? Just gate straight there? Log on, set destination, and go.

All c4 space should be shattered systems, no one should live there.

It's on the alpha for Eve Echoes. 
---
They also listed in the September patch notes that Jita stations will be renovated by some new corporation
---
That's it. I'm going back to X3:TC
---
Lmao.
---
Economic indices is a proxy for player activity, since it's player activity that generates ratting bounties/shit mined. When an index drops to a third it means player activity related to that index has dropped to a third. No MMO developer sees that big of a drop in player activity as a "good thing". If wow devs see that say, quest reward payout has dropped by a third in one month, they'd be shitting themselves.
---
I guess with less people playing, there's less jump freighter pilots to complain about getting shafted not once, but twice.
---
True, ccp should remove ratting bounties and add blue loot type drops to all npcs.
---
look at the JSIG in the message on Zkill...come on brah! don't be lazy
---
This one thousand times. We WILL try to kill you. I promise this, in Bob's name. Fight back, chase us home, jump into our holes. Stop being afraid to lose stuff and just have some fun. I promise you'll be thinking about how much fun you had instead of how much isk you lost.
---
Just recommended stuff hotlinked in the mission or even linking to eve-uni fits or community mission fit threads would be a good thing.
---
&gt;Fighters are now returning closer to the ship, when recalling them while in warp.
---
Hey fighters will no longer show up like 12,000km off your carrier when you recall them in warp. Would have been nice if they would have done this back when you could still actually fly a carrier...ya know cause blackout.
---
There's literally no point in even cloaky camping em anymore.
---
The changes really helped to push the economy in a much healthier direction. Wondering how long it was stabilize it for as everyone adjust to the changes.
---
&gt;Addressed issue that would allow multiple Ancillary Armor Repairers to be fit to one ship
---
The narrative is that eve is dying because of blackout. A bunch of thundercunts tried to use metrics to show this the other day.
---
good
---
looks more like they rolled over and died tbh
---
&gt; example your hole terminates in a null s
---
You roll them for different reasons. One reason is because you require a better high sec exit. Or when you're looking for better PVP content. Mostly I roll to be a bit more safe.
---
My C5 hole has 1 static. Suppose I login and I see three holes. Without knowing what is on the other side, does it sound safe to undock 3 nestors and start ratting? Hm... not really :)
---
So I first roll my non-static wormholes. I first jump in with a scout and check whats on the other side. If I see multiple PVP ships, it might not be a good crabbing day. I could try it, but I also risk loosing my rolling ships to them.
---
If everything is relatively safe, I roll both of the holes and afterwards my static hole. This last one makes a new sig pop-up after a minute. If I don't warp to it, my hole is isolated for a few hours, unless a new sig pops-up.
---
Thanks, I will have a look, I did see that some of the Eve Survival missions may not have been updated, so hopefully will fill in any issues.
---
Yes. But since he’s just adding up all the missing isk and attributing it to blue loot, he’s actually counting both red loot and blue loot.
---
Wasn't there a conflict on the brink of spilling into war right around the time the invasion stuff started happening?  Forces had to come home to defend and then the war fizzled out.
---
Yeah because they scram and web you and dish out 500 DPS plus.
---
&gt; Fixed an issue where logs from the client would indicate when a cloaked ship on grid initiates warp
---
wassent it when ppl started warp to your grid??
---
true bro, but that guy his blind to see reality, because he end with "blackout is super" circlejerk
---
You mean looking at data that shows wormholers making 80% of nullsec is spodbrain. Man facts must fucking ruin you if that's your stance.
---
Oh, some people are cunts in RL as well, no doubt.
---
fuck no plz
---
No, cause pl fled before goons arrived. So it was just a clean up of tribute
---
hey can you donate me 60 b  please
---
maybe you should :D
---
Do you think it would help or hurt fw if plexes were dscan blackout zones (like inside a scan inhib)?
---
&gt; They banned near 7,000 accounts for voting and RMT in August (as per the security report that was just posted).
---
that's right folks, don't vote or you get a ban
---
Can you explain that last bit a bit more. If you do not warp to the new static it doesn't actually connect to anything?
---
&gt; Abyssal Deadspace
---
I've never tried Abyssal Deadspace, but it sure sounds like a very nice thing. Thanks for this feedback!
---
For me its not only about the ISK. If I would do that, I would go back to trading. After mastering that a bit I'm sure its the best paid job in Eve.
---
I've also thought about C6 sites. I'd guess its the same as I do now, just some more expensive ships and chars that require some higher skills.
---
Lmao fixed thanks
---
So they're not pre-seedinv industrial cyno bpos, and they're not transitioning existing cynos fit to industrials. So jfs are just hooped for a day or two entirely. Dick move, ccp.
---
wormholes sound like a cool place
---
Pretty sure it already works like that
---
It's still input multiplication... just on hardware level.
---
Yes, most of the nullsec mining bots moved to highsec, specifically one system in Domain. Nice for Ninja moon mining.
---
ccplease
---
I didn´t imply anything beyond that the abundant use of cloacks in WH space has little to do with safety my man. But if you want to spin for a bit be my guest.
---
I’m inclined to say I think it would help, at least people would be caught off guard more, but I guess it means hunters would also have to enter every plex to see if there’s anything there. 
---
There’s an answer there somewhere, but yeah that would be a good experiment.
---
No slave set.
---
I doubt red loot from drifters amount to a significant percentage of total sleeper components and WH blue loot still makes up an overwhelming percentage, but that is a point of uncertainty with no clarifying data.
---
They banned two guys for uploading YouTube videos of the alpha, I'm not sure their view on screenshots but I'd probably delete it anyway if you wanna keep playing. They seem pretty tight on it
---
As someone who fights Olmeca a lot, and who cannot stand his Eve persona. I still vouch for the fact he doesn't even need blue alts to do what he does.
---
That's cancerous. The problem isn't BO, if 1 player is propping the game up with 25 accounts, then CCP has a bigger issue than some angry neck beards.
---
oh, old good times
---
Decrease in velocity of money velocity is not "healthy".

You can see where all the bots moved to HiSec because mining and bounties incre- 
---
Oh, oops, nevermind.
---
True, there is no reason to live in null, if safe ticks and mining are taken away. That’s the real problem. People quit or move to low or highsec. Null is as dead as non FW lowsec.
---
I grew up there.
---
No developer also views a completely stagnant game with an incredible devaluing of in game currency as good either.
---
&gt; it more. If you do not warp to the new sta
---
https://forums.eveonline.com/t/hole-control/87485/9 explains it pretty good. Short answer, people living on the other side can't see the sig to your hole for at least a few hours if you don't warp to it.
---
Is solo roaming viable? I tried it for a while before I left the game and just ran into gangs at every corner in nullsec.
---
Have you mined? If you don't at least take turns afking with your group you want to gauge your eyes out.
---
The ventures changes nothing, they are still gonna warp to sun when you land on 1 AU.
---
There are already things in Lowsec that do this
---
Lots of people are playing classic. My WH alliance lost a solid percentage of our actives.
---
Guess its safer to mine moons in surrounding lowsec now?
---
bots moved, but real players with pve semiafk ratters, indy alts and so cancelling their sub.

.

well really good job CCP :-D

People want to view the last year(s) as the standard for healthy economics, not the grossly overinflated thing it is.

Time to see if ratting bounties can drop below 10T/mo
---
Went out on a spur-of-the-moment kitchen sink NPSI fleet a few days ago looking for some content, and ended up roaming into Brave space. Got into [a small fight](https://zkillboard.com/related/30002615/201909020300/) with a Brave home defence fleet, and it was great fun! We started popping when our poor VNI buddy ran out of cap charges. I wanted to kill my meme-fit Nereus since it was just taking up space in my hangar and the insurance was about to expire, so I brought it along. It ended up being the last thing to die, and getting top damage on two kills. 11/10 content.
---
I had a neighbor get the generic number/letter plates in the mail.  By coincidence it said "GUN 007".
---
The amount of isks destroyed in Providence didn't drop. It's actually at the same level of June 2019
---
June 2019: 840B
---
August 2019: 843B
---
With blackout the economic activity dropped a lot but the destruction levels continue at the same level.
---
Providence it's probably the most dangerous region to live in at the moment.
---
&gt; jump into our holes
---
But they always crit the holes as they leave.
---
Weird non sequitur, but okay. Yeah, blue loot is increasingly looking like a bleeding wound. It's comparable to bounties right now, but bear in mind that they're being generated by a much, much smaller percentage of the player base than nullsec ratting bounties are. I don't have enough data here to conclusively rule it as a problem, but it'd be worth investigating.
---
&gt;4,369 account bans for botting related activities.
---
Don't worry guys the bots are gone obvioualy
---
One account? Just live in your favorite type of kspace and daytrip into wspace.
---
Jump in anyway? What's the worst that could happen? You wake up in home station minus one ship?
---
Always been, has it not?
---
Highsec mining is hilarious, because there's nothing stopping you from parking your orca army on someone else's moon and sucking all their crok.
---
Yeah there have been a few big fleet fights that likely contributed to that number. Not so much miners/ratters getting dunked on (though that is certainly happening).
---
From what I remember from the post it was when a cloaked ship already on grid warped
---
&gt; incredible devaluing of in game currency as good either.
---
The only thing that appreciated against ISK was Plex. Almost everything else stayed around the same price as it did years and years ago. This isn't Runescape or WoW where gold lost 90% of it's purchasing power between expansions/patches.

ban ban ban ban ban ban \o/ take away his eve toon too!!

“nothing of value was lost”

With rolling ships? Jump the rollers, odds are they won’t be able to get back to the hole quick enough.  They could also he rolling their static to find something they can actually fight, since a blob of supers and FAX is beyond the reach of most WH groups.
---
7k accounts banned in August - that is up from July's which was 1.7 and the entirety of Q1 and Q2 of 2019 was 17k. That is actually a little wild.
---
Using an Ikitursa fleet too
---
Most of them have not been touched after being copied over. But UNI wiki is easy to edit so if there is wrong information it can be easily fixed.
---
domain out mined test..
---
Last month it was Detorid but it's a war zone. Providence was in 2nd place.
---
Sure, do you have a reference proving your point?
---
There are chances that existing cyno-fitted ships will just work, like a double-bubble dictors, because :ccp:
---
Jf pilot btw
---
You can just say Goons. No need to call them thundercunts, even if the moniker fits.
---
&gt;please feed more kills at no risk to myself.
---
AFAIK hardware switches are legal.?
---
Like 15 solo rorq?
---
So what you're saying is during the most dead TZ the fewest players were active... Ok?
---
Are you aware his first language isn’t English? 
---
You understood his point as did everyone else. Move on

Because I am a doofus and missed this out of the patch notes when they were initially published, here are the details of the Fitting Warnings feature in case you missed it:  
---
**Fitting Warnings:**
---
* The Fitting Warnings feature analyses the fitting of your ships, warns you when your fit is off in some way and give you hints on how to fix the issues. The warnings range in severity from Red (problems with the fit that would prohibit you from fitting everything, undocking, warping or jumping) to White (elements that are not strictly bad but could cause confusion or a sub-optimal experience)
---
* There are 4 new icons in the Fitting window, each of them is only displayed if any of the rules in the corresponding category are broken.
---
* Hovering over the warning icons will list the respective warnings along with highlighting the elements of the fitting that are causing the      warning
---
* The warnings are:
---
   * Crucial (Red):
---
      * The ship's CPU is overloaded
---
      * The ship's Powergrid overloaded
---
      * The ship's Cargo is overloaded
---
      * The ship is a Strategic Cruiser and is missing a subsystem
---
   * Warning (Yellow):
---
      * The ship has Invalid modules fitted (for example after a ship has been rebalanced or when swapping subsystems on a Strategic Cruiser)
---
      * Some fitted Modules are not providing bonus (for example if you have a Magnetic Field Stabilizer fit but all your guns are projectiles turrets)
---
      * Mixing turret groups
---
      * Mixing turret sizes 
---
      * Mixing launcher groups
---
      * Both Shield and Armor modules fitted
---
      * Offline modules
---
   * Info (white):
---
      * Armor tanking a ship categorized as shield ship
---
      * Shield tanking a ship categorized as armor ship
---
      * Polarized weapons fitted
---
   * Missing skills
---
      * Skills for the ship or fitted modules are missing
---
      * Skills for items in the ships cargohold are missing
---
They are on the patch notes page now :\]
---
BLOPs can currently jump to regular and covert cynos, so it looks like CCP is just continuing that trend.
---
Hope they fix isk generation too what the point mining (ore) ratting without a Rorqual/super under an umbrella ? the reward is extremly poor + time consuming and you probably gonna die if you do   
---
long live blackout but we need a big change of gamedesign if you do (much much more rewarding NS but you can loose everything moaar war please)
---
Says the guy hiding under the super cap umbrella.
---
Holes have several stages and limited mass. I suspect they are rolling holes or have put a lot of mass through it if it is crit. You should jump in earlier and bubble up if you want to preserve the hole
---
super-capital umbrella meta dead in 4 days. LOL!!
---
No that’s not what he said
---
Fw space is dead as well. Who wants to orbit a beacon for hours on end?
---
run for CSM Querns.
---
A lot of the isks destroyed in Providence are from actual fighting between all the parties in there wich is a good thing.
---
Yes it is. Small fast things can evade most camps
---
Yeah because bots totally have lower output than real players...
---
Hi, 
---
I've not been living here for 6 months without loosing a ship. I live here for 5 weeks now and I did loose some ships, just not while ratting. I tried to solo kill some stuff and lost a few ships while doing that.
---
I do agree with the fact that wormhole space is earning more than carrier ratting in null. Now most carrier ratters are not piloting 3-4 chars at the same time. This does make a huge difference.
---
Still I would say null is safer. And yes it earns less. In my opinion this is why people refer a lot to phrases as 'more risk is more isk'.
---
Based on your choice of words, it doesn't sound like you've lived in wormholes. I might be wrong here, if so, sorry for that. Now I've lived in wormholes for 2+ years and I've also lived 1.5 year in null. I've also done the rorqual mining, went on big fleets etc and participated in many rescue missions when someone was tackled. My personal experience says it 'was' less risk in null. I don't have experience in null with the black-out, but I can imagine its a bit harder now if you're not protected under a huge umbrella. 
---
Could be a good reason for a few null bears to move into wormhole space. This is one of the reasons I've created this post!
---
People still fly carriers in blackout.  It might not be a great PvE choice, but I encourage krabs to fly them all the same.
---
Except that was expected and intended.
---
Getting harder to print isk and ore isn't a bad thing.
---
We don't need 20% inflation per year to keep the game running.  People wanted more of a limit on titans and capitals.  That's what this is.
---
However it's also been completely stagnant for the past 3 months.
---
If they can be jumped to, they can be bridged to...
---
Another (give or take) 10k accounts deleted. But falling PCU is *totally* and *only* people unsubbing. /s
---
That's reasonable, but I think you have less to stress about than you think. Let's break down the causes why we're seeing a drop in player count:
---
* Krabs quitting over the blackout
---
* Bots shut down by the blackout
---
* People getting into WoW Classic (shiny new toy)
---
It's undeniable that dozens/hundreds of bot VNI farms with likely thousands of characters shut down at the start of the blackout. The difference in Detorid/Wicked Creek, for example, is insane. Those losses show up on PCU charts but I think we can agree it's a good thing.
---
We're also going to lose people to WoW classic. I've seen that in my own group, with long time players taking a break to geek out over the shiny new game. I expect a lot (but not all) of them will come back after a few months of playing the new game. 
---
Now, I don't deny that there are people legitimately not playing because of the blackout. There are, but I don't think they're a big problem. They need to vent their frustration, but eventually many of them will catch the bug again and log back in. I don't much care either way, their min/maxing ticks gave us repeated drone and carrier nerfs and resulted in way too much drama in the alliances I've been in. I legitimately think the game is better off without them.
---
Unfortunately the way CCP handled the "Chaos Era" rapid fire changes combined with the release of a big competing MMO means that the data is fucked. We can all draw whatever conclusions we want from the player drop.
---
yeah you right, i remember it wrong
---
This is good news. Ship prices are currently deflated and this will help correct and make me some more isk
---
Yeah, CCP should stop giving botters such a hard time! Unban them all I say!
---
It's true.  Fraternity is dropping sov as we speak.
---
Because every single one of those was a rerolled account. None of them were accounts that didn't get nabbed during the past few sweeps. /s
---
Does anyone live there?  C4 space sucks, C2s and C5s are the popular systems.
---
Have you noticed any differences since the blackout started? (signature frequency/traffic)
---
We never had 20% inflation per year for anything that's not PLEX, because that's something that can't be generated by player activity.
---
&gt; People wanted more of a limit on titans and capitals. That's what this is.
---
So uhh, nerf their EHP to like 500k for caps, 4-5 mil for supers, and 10-15 mil for titans. Then nerf their damage somewhat proportionally and remove fighters from supercarriers.
---
Blackout fucks every aspect of null, with capitals being affected the least since their native tank allows them to be saved far more easily than a subcap.
---
Nah, dotlan.
---
66% of nullsec player were bots, I never knew that.
---
Well if you don't have what it takes to live in 0.0 now ... better leave for greener pastures. 
---
Can also complain in reddit and wait for things to go back to the "good old times"... but I think local in 0.0 will NOT come back.
---
I agree blackout doesnt solve the bigger issues surrounding things like citadels and umbrellas, but it shakes things up quite when you don't t have instant perfect intel.
---
Faucets are out of control and the ability to scale income generation with mostly AFK earning is way too high.
---
The GIA/GSA gets them every time
---
newp.  My sigils on sisi which already had normal cynos fitted, instead had them offlined.  So, RIP.
---
Thank you very much :)
---
Nope. But you will
---
Correct.  Tested it on sisi, it works for bridging, too.
---
Could it be maybe that there isn't some vast GSM conspiracy, and Goon CSM members actually have reasonable ideas, objections, and just get ignored by CCP?
---
Nah couldn't be.
---
It is one of my favourites and I hope to save up for the bigger version of it one day.
---
Except it’s not dead at all.
---
Ah, bummer.
---
Fight us!
---
As you run back to your home 
---
Yet there's no increase in agent mission payouts or high sec mining in the past 3 months? If they were all migrating to high sec those numbers would have increase greatly. It's almost like *gasp* Goons are wrong about botting.
---
The ball is never in CCPs court and no matter how much you enjoy your null sec peers they are not the complete representation of all things. I became beyond fond of Sion but one has to preserve ones part of the game or at least the part you are there to represent.
---
CCPs priorities change for reasons outside of passion for the game. You cannot do and just leave it. You have to chase it and fight for it and carry it around to get it. And you'll still fail sometimes but not as much.
---
Kinda disappointing tone.
---
So remove rorqual mining drone bonus and drone auto aggress.
---
Plenty voiced their opinion, it fell on deaf ears apparently.  As usual 0.0 will be fine.  JF pilots with static routes can stage their cyno ships.  Contract haulers are F'd tho.  RIP black frog.
---
&gt; Not Satire
---
I'll be the judge of that.
---
Pretty amazing that CCp went in such a bizarre direction with cynos.
---
They’re doing everything possible to make it seem like they’re balancing caps without, y’know, actually balancing caps...
---
I shouldn’t be surprised that rather than make intelligible changes they instead doubled down on this with a new cyno, but I am. 
---
What kinda game is CCP actually trying to make here?
---
And once everyone leaves who are the elite pvpers going to fight, because right now they only gank krabs who are unable to fight back.
---
Blue loot is nuts, it's like 65% of the isk nullsec makes by a significantly smaller population. But I guess most people are just like lol nullsec.
---
Hard to kill ships if you don't log in.
---
And anything about preserving industry cyno bpos so jump freighter pilots don’t take it in the ass twice in one patch?
---
If blue loot is such easy krabbing as a few morons on Reddit seem to think, maybe they should try it for a while.
---
Can you stick a DST in a FW plex?
---
Then what does dying mean to you?
---
you do realize CCP is already in deep shit with those ultra good changes?
---
Why not constellation chat since you can know if someone is within ~5 systems of you but not exactly where. Unless you are in a boarder system then hope they are coming from one of the other entrances.
---
ISK injectors when
---
I have no interest I don't rat and I don't mine. I just can't be bothered
---
Why are black ops able to use industrial cynos?
---
The facts are we have less bots and afk players in some of the most profitable space. If you can't adapt, then die. WHs had blackouts all along, so to say the blackout is a failure is a complete lack of a brain. There is no data other than less players logging in. Those are bot farms and your typical carebear afk player that was never in fron of his computer. I agree with most here... the game is better without them. Probably better without people like you too.
---
They are doing everything they can to buff blackops.
---
Weekly reminder that 80% of EVE players never leave highsec, join a corp or PvP
---
Well, you're certainly angry.
---
I've already moved my krabbing to high sec. It's much safer. They keep this up and sov null will have no one holding the sov.
---
ccpls add rainbow warning to alert you to the lack of Exotic Dancers (male) in your cargo hold
---
Single digit IQ troglodytes are very unlikely to play a video game.
---
Cleaning out the ol' hard drive and found fourty (AS MANY AS FOUR TENS) gigabytes of screencap of a fleet I was on for some reason, had a scrub through it for old time's sake and had a wee giggle at this. Hopefully y'all enjoy it.
---
Without actually buffing them though :0
---
Seriously? You love killing players that can't fight back? Wow... maybe I was wrong, people like you shouldn't play either. LOL Someone afk is NOT content. You want to play eve afk, dock up. Period.
---
That said, I don't think it's all sunshine and roses. I've got concerns about having targets to drop, too. So far the war with Frat is keeping me fat and happy, and surprisingly I'm seeing more DED/mission runners getting caught again (which is awesome, they're ideal prey). But I won't pretend that I'm not cautious in my optimism.
---
&gt;They had 1 massive buff then it was nerf after nerf
---
They had two buffs.  
---
\- When CCP increased the number of anomalies per system, with the Aegis patch  
---
\- When CCP buffed rorquals.  
---
The second one was so massive that the amount mined remained up despite all the little nerfs.
---
That is the only place where I have encountered them, to be fair. I'm sure that they do other stuff since they're a pretty large corp, but most members seem to focus on that.
---
&gt;They are going to introduce a much larger class of warships for players to build (probably at the scale of the Trigivalin world ship thing), because clearly that's going to help solve SuperCap proliferation and be "more harder" to build than Supers.
---
I am sure they will be so expensive that only one or two will ever be built.....
---
&gt;wE bUiLd YoUr ShIpS

What's this new implant set?
---
Yesterday I shot a newbro who'd been in the game for 3 days. But you know what? I sent him 10 million ISK and said welcome to the game. Grief counseled.
---
rolling over and giving up.
---
This just in..HS safer than NS.
---
Why don't the people complaining about blue loot in the MER Reddit posts every month just try wormhole life if it's so easy and low-risk relative to the output?
---
Delayed local in the form you suggested is exactly what they should of done / do.  It's a middle of the road win win situation where people would still be out pveing outside of delve, and gankers ( I will not call them pvpers because they are low skilled lazy risk averse people who try to run away at the first sign they have entered a trap ) can still get what they want. 
---
The problem is ccp. it's not an on/off switch so it takes work and they don't want to do any work beyond creating new skins to sell us for plex
---
As far as I can tell, it's by far the highest number of bans for a single month since CCP started publishing security reports.
---
We are entering the age of the BAIT BATTLE BADGER!!!!
---
Honest answer? Because it's just as useless as no local. It's the kind of compromise someone would make when they don't want to make a compromise and hope someone thinks it's a good deal.
---
&gt; PvE:
---
The Logistics Control Array structures within the Override Transfer Array incursion site have been updated to use the hacking minigame instead of the old random chance mechanic.
---
I haven't run incursions in years but this seems like a notable change.
---
At the same time people in these topics are very concerned about elite pvpers getting nothing to kill after everyone leaves null. So...someone gotta feed
---
Aw, cute!
---
The "Board my Corvette" button is just below the undock button.
---
It used to automatically pop you into a rookie ship when docking in a pod at a station with no ships, but they eventually made it a button for convenience (no unwanted rookie ships and no need to shuffle around to get a new one when you want it)
---
How long do you think it takes someone banned, that was botting 40-60 accounts, to roll another 40-60 and get them online? A day or two maybe? So the bans don't really impact population numbers. They are just rerolled.
---
Who are you, Luke Skywalker?
---
It feels like there is an increased amount of null sec hole popping up. I've had days when I woke up with 3 new null sec holes in my hole. 
---
Now I've never lived alone before, so it could be that before this was also happening, but people outside of my timezone had already rolled it.
---
I guess the larger wormhole corporations might have some numbers on this. For me its just a feeling, not verified.
---
I don't know.
---
I never saw it when I flew with them. My Black Ops pilot was in wingspan so I was mostly trying to run blops fleets.
---
Well we can't know what they did, but we can tell they didn't die in the sense of losing their ships. And all the elite pvpers in reddit said blackout would lead to more kills.
---
You're defender, it's not like you actually try to get fun content. Seek and you shall find.
---
When you settle into a nice cozy blob you gotta justify it somehow.
---
Because they can already use normal and covert so it makes sense that if it's a cyno, they'd be able to lock on to it. 
---
Considering that industrial cynos are used by the same ships that can use coverts instead, not a big deal.
---
And the whole time I really just wanted to go to tosche station to mess around with the guys
---
Yeah man. Only thing is it's not dead.
---
Before blackout, you could do quite a bit in a solo/duo assfrig/t3d. At this point, I have just given up b/c blackout seems to drive everyone who isn't prepared for a serious fight (and thus, prepared enough to easily murderize a single t3d or frigate) out of nullsec, or at least stopped them from undocking in casual ships.
---
&gt;Wormholes make metric fucktons of money. 
---
You make massive ISK per hour for a short while, but when you want to print ISK 24/7 then nothing beats pre-blackout nullsec.
---
&gt;If I had to guess you're living in C3 at the highest and ya, you're not getting paid much. Take a look at Rykki's Guide and you can see C4 sites paying out between 50-150mil in blue loot and C5s paying 150-330mil ISK. thats \*per site\* and blue loot meaning an NPC will \*always\* buy it at that price. a haven in null is worth \~40-60mil depending on your corp's taxes and battleship spawns. and before you say 'but null sites are unlimited' if you're not a damn scrub, you farm your static, not your home, and you too will have infinite sites to run.
---
A C5 site is 230mil, plus 300 if you kill the drifter. It is way harder to do than a Haven, so comparing site with site is disingenuous. Since you claim to be familiar with them, I suggest you read what spawns and how much dps you have to deal with, how many ehp you have to grind through to complete either.
---
I do agree high-end wormhole sites are good ISK, IF you only run them for a couple hours at a time, IF you don't factor in the time spent probing and scouting your farming area, and IF you are ready to accept higher risks.  
---
&gt;Wormholes are \*not\* more dangerous than null. you \*cannot\* be hot dropped in a wormhole. if you crit your statics, and you pay attention to your probe scanner you will \*know\* the instant someone has rolled into you. you don't \*NEED\* local when you have that kind of instant, free intel.
---
...except in the previous paragraph you wrote *if you're not a damn scrub, you farm your static, not your home*
---
so which is it? Also you're wrong: when someone rolls into you, the new sig doesn't pop immediately on your end.  
---
...and while you cannot be hot dropped in a wormhole, there's no friendly supercap umbrella ready to bail you out either.  
---
TLDR: if you feel risk vs reward is insanely skewed toward WHs, why don't you try them out for yourself? I do agree that for the casual bear, blackout nullsec has become pretty much as bad as w-space: only marginally safer (you can scout anything but blops), but more traffic so greater odds of someone ganking you.
---
they can also use normal cynos
---
Yup, possibly even buffed.
---
F in chat for Widows.
---
bismallah
---
I have no idea :) That would be up to the Team Trilambda. I hope they look like this though, they look awesome!
---
Sorry but what does blackout have to do with not being able to fly carriers?
---
Just insure that shit and accept that dangerous space is dangerous. If someone comes, fight. If you die, you die. 
---
Why do cap pilots always forget this?
---
It's like people forgot PvP carriers exist
---
Speculation.
---
I had four tens in my first truck as a teen. It was great fun in the bush. I miss it alot
---
[deleted]
---
Would 100% increase botting
---
It's a kind of support :)
---
Only a large
---
That's just crazy. I wonder if it became easier to catch them because they had to change their methods for botting and intel gathering.
---
These aren't normal cynos.
---
That’s not really true. There’s a ton of profitable stuff to move between hubs
---
Yup. CCP so lazy, they didn't even change the color of the industrial cyno module.  Looks the same as a current cyno generator.  
---
Patch day is gonna be a mad rush to buy blueprints, build a shitload of cynos at 0/0 and then put the prints into research while you spread those things around everywhere.
---
So much fun. I'm glad CCP met their goal of not disrupting JF logistics at all with this patch.
---
Why do exploration ships fit them? Why do the alts used to watch gates use them?
---
How many of them throw in the towel since those 40-60 suddenly only make a fraction of their previous ISK/hr? How many of the RMTers give up because it's getting closer to unsustainable?
---
There is no reason to buff blackops while nerfing every other cyno. If these cynos are meant for jump freighters then make them only for jump freighters. No one uses a t1 indy to run cynos for blackops now, but plenty use it for jump freighters.
---
And miss out on the fun ?
---
Nullsec was always accessible to casual players, why aren't they welcome anymore? Lots of us would rather stop EVE than move to low/highsec.
---
I will give it a try for sure! Huge thanks!
---
dont have to pay for college if they are in prison xD
---
Shit. If I ate all that gluten and shit I'd be dead by the end.
---
Those arent pvpers. A prime example of a pvper is Rawstyle. Look him up.
---
The guys you are referring to are more risk averse than a super pilot waiting until downtime to make one jump
---
Still so SO gutted about this. Was the only part of the change i was hyped for :(
---
I'm sure they will get a [warm welcome](https://zkillboard.com/related/31001759/201908232200/)
---
&gt; Added 50% bonus to Cynosural Field Duration for Black Ops Battleships. 
---
I hope that mean 50% reduction.
---
Okay that's just factually incorrect blops bait industrials are fucking *everywhere*.
---
You can still go on dotlan and look up npc kills to find rattera
---
Buy isk on a Russian website
---
You can automatically refresh the data from ESI with the cache control, so you don't need to do it manually.
---
Each resource in the swagger returns with expiry date in the header.  That means the data won't be modified in the ESI until that expiry moment.
---
So you can make a formal definition about the checks and just trigger a warning when a value is bad.
---
here : [https://github.com/guiguilechat/JCELechat/blob/master/model/esi/JCESI/src/main/java/fr/guiguilechat/jcelechat/jcesi/connected/modeled/EveCharacter.java#L474](https://github.com/guiguilechat/JCELechat/blob/master/model/esi/JCESI/src/main/java/fr/guiguilechat/jcelechat/jcesi/connected/modeled/EveCharacter.java#L474)
---
is how I personally check if my toons are alphas or not (and it works - I have alpha toons and it can detect their alphaness, while detecting omegas as omegas). Basically I have a variable per connection (that is account)  that holds the boolean state of alphaness and this variable can be listened to .
---
This is decoration over my lib that translates the ESI swagger into a complete library to keep the state of resource in memory, and react to changes (including the initial set). So this represents in programmer language the access to the notion of alphaness, and is kept updated as long as the program runs (so if during the program execution, the account becomes alpha, then the variable is modified).
---
A lot of the code lines are just synchronization and caching, that is to enhance the performances a lot (and by a lot I mean a fucking huge lot - without this it's not even worth using ESI IMO). eg you see a lot of if(cache==null) synchronized(something) if(cache==null) initcache, that is a check sync check burger to avoid a lot of synchronization overhead (with null check) and a lot of multiple call overhead with caching.

Here you can see how I get the effective training rate (basically I use the first skill on the skillqueue and I get the estimated completion)

---
Here you can see how I check if a skill has reduced active valyue : I litterally say "when I receive the skills list from the esi, I stream the skills values as provided by the swagge description, I keep only those with an active value different than the trained value ; and I set to true if there is at least one of those skills".
---

---
Here you can see how I create that list of skills : I literally ask the library that translated the swagger into calls, but instead of an array I use a list because reasons that I don't remember of.

Catering to whales in a niche sandbox game is incredibly stupid.  Yes, it may look good short term, but when the whales get bored or don't have any non-whales to smash because everyone quits, they move on, and bring their spending with them.  And most whales have the attention span of a goldfish.

Then don't name this an industrial cyno. Maybe ccp can be honest about their intentions of wanting to buff blackops while nerfing everything else. It's not like a Covert ops cloak isn't the single most risk averse item in game, including warp core stabs.
---
just as much as a direct ESI access would.
---
DONT fucking EVER make your  corpmate data public. That's a reason to get banned from the game, and ruin their characters.
---
Black ops can't even fit covert cynos...
---
Are Industrial Cynosural Fields visible system-wide or only nearby like the covert ones?
---
basis is to make http calls.
---
But yeah I guess you would need basic lessons to understand how a computer works.
---
&gt;you are doing it right now...
---
​if you feel like you're being shouted down you must be some sorta boomer
---
Try submitting a support ticket and asking for a temporary ban?
---
Or even better, super crit the hole before you chase them back into it, forcing them to either stay or split their fleet continuing through.
---
Start hyperdunking in highsec.
---
That participant list looks like a mix of Spectre regulars and names that I recognize from Placid/Black Rise local. Somewhat overlapping. I don't know if many of the welcoming party are actual wormholers, rather someone got numbers for a structure bash through Spectre.
---
Visible systemwide and on the map.
---
MER supports the narrative, less destroyed in August then any month going back to August 2017.
---
Lol yes. Dangerous wormhole is dangerous.. Hehehe. I use to farm C5 and trust me it was not dangerous when you don't just Yolo like an idiot. If you understand the scope of safety, have alts and properly set up, its very safe and print more money than the fed
---
I don't do it anymore so I gladly raise awareness of it now. It will be in the crosshairs soon enough.

No Eve pilot has ever had four tens total, much less at one time.

Ya know, I think most places in game they are called corvettes but the wrecks are labeled "rookie ship wreck" after they're destroyed. I wonder if the tutorial calls them rookie ships and people don't understand that is the same as corvette.
---
it's fixed, the best way to currently get a several month ban and eventual overturn is to gank people leaving the rookie systems with throwaway thrashers
---
Become Brisc Rubal
---
Not according to Texas Law!
---
That is literally what he said, a depleted hole because they used it to move their fleet in and out leads to a fractured response fleet in their home hole. Wormholers want home field advantage in their space but are making sure ccp removes it from nullsec.
---
&gt; Why do exploration ships fit them?
---
convenience while probing. and mwd-cloaking isn´t really neccessary in wh space if you run into a camp. they don´t have to. as soon as they drop probes anyone knows they are there anyways. 
---
&gt; Why do the alts used to watch holes use them?
---
why do the throwaway alts in null watching gates use them? same reason. convenience.
---
I wonder how useful this is now given the cyno changes?
---
This, so fucking tiring.... it's like people just want free kills or something.
---
Still no tiericide 😥
---
It's more than just their preferred activity. There are PVE players I respect. But I've got a big issue with the players who go to large nullsec alliances, don't integrate or contribute to home defense, and ignore pings to focus on their ticks. They leave to the next safest alliance as soon as the going gets inconvenient (never mind tough), and often lobby CCP to keep the game safe and stagnant because those are the ideal conditions for them to make money.
---
Those players -- and everyone in a large nullsec alliance knows the type -- are actively harmful to nullsec and the game as a whole. Fuck their tax contributions, it doesn't make up for years of nerfs or the constant drama they cause. There's space for them in the game, namely low and high sec areas, but it's time for the way they were conducting business before to end. And if they decide to quit in protest then all the better, imo.
---
So only the bridging ship can't but the rest of the fleet relies on being invisible and immune to consequences. Covert ganking fleets couldn't be more risk averse.
---
7k banned in the past month
---
Fuck yeah I'm saving this one up for a special occasion
---
Ya except wormholes are already safer and more profitable, why would they move to nullsec.
---
Hah. Nullsec defense fleets are some of the most fun ive had in the game recently
---
It's not dead but much more inconvenient. Which is kind of the point.
---
I still have my main and an alt in null, but only for fleet pvp shit. Otherwise, I’ve moved isk-making activities - other than PI - back to highsec.
---
Really, I’ve been spending more time mining in highsec than playing on my null chars. There’s not enough going on in null these days.
---
At least not with the current attitude. While blackout definitely make it harder to be safe, it's still not as harsh as it was before the whole anomaly / sov redesign. Back then people where frowned upon as soon as they undocked a carrier, and there was no respawning of anomalies.
---
&gt;When attempting to repackage multiple items, if at least one of them is a container, a special warning message will be shown.
---
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS. I've made that fuck up for the last time (I hope)
---
&gt; The amount of isks destroyed in Providence didn't drop. It's actually at the same level of June 2019
---
&gt; 
---
So there were less people in space but more destruction. That indicates that hunters had an enormously higher level of success.
---
This is a fact I’ve been trying to say in other threads but I have failed to adequately convey the same message you just did. Either that, or the ppl on those threads are just too braindead to understand it. It’s probably a factor of both. 
---
I agree with you.
---
Welcome to Reddit, your new home.    The more time you spend here, the less you will feel inclined to log on.
---
Eve doesn't have wars anymore because there's nothing of value to war over.
---
Null is safe too when you don't login
---
No they really can't... They have bonuses to normal cloaks but Cov Ops is not possible.
---
Use racial slurs against Caucasians in jita
---
EZ, just delet concord :3
---
That's because they kind of suck.
---
Didn't know the Russians had their own server.
---
It warns you that such a thing is possible when ejecting from a ship.
---
Tbh CCP never tackle the issue with the right angle, they first buff rorqual to give solo miner a ship good enough to "compete" with multiboxer, they made it worth it to use by giving them insane mining yield, all in all it was a very good thing, but combine with Citadel (EC) who give the opportunity to indy guy to build supers/titan faster and cheaper than ever before + multiboxer just had to trade their barge for rorqual because, yeah, after 15 years people have enough wealth to buy a lot of them.
---
CCP recently tried to make barge worth again by increasing the boost and that's a good stuff (tbh even if I made my recent wealth by rorqual multiboxing, I'm team barge I found them so cute to use with all the laser and much more "RP"). CCP should have look into something to force multiboxer to use barge and force solo player to use rorquals
---
They weren't providing any fucking content and you know it.

&gt;I really like this shakeup.
---
&gt;I haven't been this excited about this game in a while.
---
&gt;I love it. It does exactly what nullsec needs, and that's shaking everything up.
---
&gt;Judging by a quick glance through the forum thread, it appears half of NC. are unsubscribing.
---
&gt;Wormholes send their regards.
---
&gt;This is the shake up that everyone will whine about, but what everyone needs.
---
&gt;This is the best thing I have ever seen for smaller groups to be able to operate without fear of getting the 5 minute hotdrop from the bigger groups.
---
&gt;Holy fuck the amount of people this will piss off is amazing. It's...so...beautiful.
---
&gt;So much mad. Very anger. I like these changes a lot, contrary to all this mad.

&gt;Its a whole new game

All comments sampled from the reddit thread put up in response to CCP's devblog announcing jump fatigue, a few years ago.

---
Before anyone gets too excited about these changes, just remember the exact same shit was being said not all that long before the game started coalescing into a handful of major supercap umbrellas.  CCP's heavy-handed nerfs tend to not have a good effect on things, as we usually shift from one crappy meta, to the next.
---
Thats even more spacepenis than the geddon, ofc they couldnt do it. 
---
That said, the bhallgorn is one of the most popular faction battleships. It deserves a custom model
---
It's pretty easy to cut wormholers off from escaping. You can guess exactly where they're going to go, and no local means they don't see your cloaked dictor posting up/rollers critting their escape hole unless they left scouts behind.
---
Just gotta think like a wormholer, use their own tricks, and you can catch them.
---
Yet here we are
---
I WANT TO BELIEVE
---
Ok thanks, I’ll try it the next time I get online
---
I mean it has zero impact. That umbrella essentially has infinite recons. And people with rorq alts can inject their alts at no lasting cost to them. Doesn’t have to anything special. Just recon, sit cloaked, cyno. gg
---
Specifically bumping. They dont want to invest more assets into the current ships/scales untill they have solved that issue. 
---
If capital bumpjng gets fixed and they properly rescale capitals/supers they can start doing a lot more with them, such as giving titans higher res textures/models
---
People complain when their game play style is nerfed. Pointing to a similarish feature in hope of getting the nerf undone.
---
There should never have been 15 rorquals in the damn game
---
I think it looks more like a huge oracle
---
Boring.
---
" Added 50% bonus to Cynosural Field Duration for Black Ops Battleships. "
---
So this might be a silly question, but does that make the cycle longer or shorter?
---
But not logging in is less profitable. Nerfing nullsec is all rage because it's to safe but we have math here that shows nearly as much isk is made in wspace with significantly less people. Why would they ever bother taking nullsec space when they already have the richest space. They just want hunting reserves that can't threaten them back.
---
And Vale.
---
That doesn't really have anything to do with what I was commenting on. I wasn't talking about roaming gangs finding ratters to kill, I was talking about gangs finding each other to kill.  
---
The intel local gives is just as much a tool for pvpers to find each other as it is for pvers to avoid being caught.
---
To add to queen, MCTs are not 500 plex in the NXT iirc. I think they are 450 plex
---
Yes. Seems so :)
---
Not true.   There is always hate and loathing.
---
Or fatigue reduction
---
That's great, but the numbers show less and less ships are actually dying. So you might be having fun but collectively the game is on a down trend. This is despite reddit claiming thousands of pvpers would come back to these changes.
---
They should if ccp actually expects them to light a cyno now.
---
I'd go if I was called, I guess. Hasn't been necessary yet.
---
This is pretty dope. I love blops and cloakies. Best playstyle in eve imo.
---
The biggest influence on ship destruction is nullsec wars. If they want to boost that number they should  start tweaking sov and structure war mechanics
---
Congrats on making it! Keep going to 2t now.
---
I think vale was a direct result of blackout.
---
Ditto for geminate
---
More like goons are gaslighting as usual.
---
Indeed, instead ccp chose to nerf local and cynos, the later will actually hinder nullsec wars even further. So no one knows what CCP is trying to do, but we can tell based in provided data all they are doing is causing less activity.
---
Which is funny since hilmar claimed activity has never been higher.
---
I too love making 1/10 of my usual income.
---
What are memesis implants? Didn't see these on the September pirate implant sets that were promised.
---
There would be at least a strategy counter to that in days or weeks. Recons aren't rorqs, they can be pretty much volleyed even if tanked. Limits time defense fleet has to jump, need one more account that does nothing else. Win win for hunters and CCP.
---
I think the only way it would ever be used would be something like siege reduction, maybe fatigue reduction too tbh. So it can do a really fast hit/run or something. 
---
Still feel carrier/super/titan are best for faction stuff and likely to get most use. Angel carrier could be amazing.
---
If brisc is complimenting you you’re doing something wrong
---
I did look at the map and other than the 1 warzone, nullsec is dead. You can see little spikes in each staging system but almost nothing else for huge swathes of systems
---
You are right. They all quit.
---
Me sure i m saying that since the begining. Number are confirming it for the noment.
---
It used to be that if you ran out of money during a war, you could JC home for a couple days and rat up some isk and JC back. Now if you do that, the umbrella isn't present so you can't really rat in a super/carrier and subcap ratting is iffy.
---
&gt; when you could still actually fly a carrier...ya know cause blackout.
---
I just recently flew a titan, 2 faxes and a dread through multiple hostile regions.  play better
---
How are you losing home field advantage?
---
Now to actually get a shirt with this on it XD
---
You mean the Anathema? PM me your name and I'll pay for one.
---
I m happy when i kill ppl. If they are afk it s there problem.
---
If you go far enough back it was jump clone to highsec to run l4s to make isk.
---
&gt; 4,369 account bans for botting related activities.
---
Meanwhile the exploration bots I've reported multiple times are still out in force.
---
I was looking into maybe returning to Eve after a few year hiatus, and last I played Black Frog was my primary source of income. These cyno changes have completely killed any motivation I had however. Carrying around cynos/ozone already took up precious cargo space; having to carry around industrials for staging/replacing to light the cynos, when it's already pretty likely you're going to lose the cyno ship, feels like a slap in the face.
---
WH very safe, please move to WH.
---
No local favors the hunter and roamer too much at least give the defenders some options to react. There is no indication that local is coming back and ccp has shown that they are incompetent in securing the client side info from exploitation by bots.
---
The Recons don’t have to be within shooting range of whatever is dropped on them.  There’s plenty of ways to have the same response time as before.
---

https://www.eveonline.com/article/pxf0x3/monthly-security-report-august-2019
---
yea but the point is theyre setting it up so blopses can target every type of cyno
---
i mean its not really a problem unless they have some other advantage than just ships they can be fitted to
---
Meh, you want to moon in perfect safety? Time your shit precisely and have your ganking alts at the ready to make it clear to competing orcas that they should mine elsewhere.
---
Can’t take 200 guys against 5 wormholers
---
Just give me all your stuff and you’ll feel way better! You don’t wanna start all over again, right?
---
Why do blackops need to target every cyno though. These were made specifically for jump freighters, black ops already have a special cyno and normal cynos don't exist. This just tips the hand that they want to buff covops but can't do it directly.
---
Industrial cynos can be given god mode by a PANIC, can be used on low sp proc alts (reship into badger/nereus from SMA) and allows you to blops bridge/jump a bricked cyno blops/recon then a FAX to your rorqual. It's a huge buff for umbrellas compared to the initial proposal.
---
Cool, thanks

Bounties are proxy for orbiting AFK drone boats.

NPC null was always accessible to casual players, sov null not so much.
---
RMT your assets away in super obvious ways. Spend the money on hard drugs.
---
It's phrased poorly, but it would be a reduction in cycle time.
---
I just did that shit the other day and i legit almost uninstalled lmfao
---
Just goes to show how reliant nullsec had become on the free safe ISK printers.
---
Wasn't one of the proposed nerfs to cyno have it drop ships rly far away? And no, there isn't. It might be a small increase, but it will be there. I wouldn't be surprised if some fleets would troll recons to decloak and try to cyno in  and pop em just for kicks.
---
Strength to change comes from within.
---
Set limits for yourself and stick to them.
---
It is both simple and hard, but you can do it.
---
&gt; • If the data shows that blackout is significantly damaging to Eve, then CCP could hide this data from players or even CSM, but they wouldn't intentionally misrepresent it internally. CCP is a for-profit company. They won't ignore or misrepresent internal data. Also, nothing about this is about Hilmar's bonuses.
---
What in the fuck is this sentence? If the data shows ccp is wrong you want them to lie to the public and not fix it? Is this how deluded you are into thinking blackout good?
---
i kinda miss ya'll being neighbors.
---
Have fun suicide ganking even a single orca. They tank like monsters, at least by the standards of highsec. 
---
The general idea is that taking territory (as defined by moons) should instill at least a degree of exclusivity, or at least provide you with the tools to enforce your claim. Right now, you cannot. Full stop.
---
Learn some self control and just break your pc
---
Notify all your credit card companies that you lost your cards so they send you new ones while locking your old ones. Then cancel your subscriptions. (Only works when your time is running out)
---
Lol.  Yep.  
---
All bots. 
---
Nothing to see here.  
---
No real person’s gameplay was negatively impacted by the changes, and even if it was...and it was not...they should HTFU and understand that’s it’s all for the best.
---
Recon Kikis that also fire missiles, so omni damage roaming HS. That's gonna be fun.
---
wtf i love Inner Hell now
---
Its not a silly question, with that bonus cyno on a black op are gonna last 15 minutes.
---
Before the cyno change black ops were useless.
---
After the announcement of the cyno change black ops became mega useles.
---
And now with this patch note they are super useless.
---
Now if CCP wanted to reduce the cyno time on a black ops maybe they should hire someone with basic english skill.
---
As i see new patchnote they will do nothing... Just one new low effort change to cyno. F... CCP let them die.
---
That's probably what it's going to be again, or daytrip into C3's.
---
They totally adapted.
---
Not logging on and playing other games is actually a pretty good adaptation to having your gameplay taken apart.
---
Why don't people just look this shit up in the fucking game instead of arguing about it on reddit?
---
I mean there’s nothing stopping them from cynoing in FAX/etc at a citadel and then warping in to an invulnerable rorq.  The only thing there is the umbrella has to try slightly harder to kill attackers (like keeping cloaked bubblers on grid). But the rorqs aren’t dying and recons don’t have to either.
---
&gt; Ships that bump while attempting to enter warp will now automatically enter warp if they remain in the pre-warp state for three minutes continuously. Scramblers or any other form of canceling the warp will reset this timer.
---
rip bumping in hisec?
---
Depends on how much of their operation was disrupted by the ban. 
---
If CCP caught the full ring then I doubt they'll get it back up anytime soon (if ever). If only half the ring got caught then there's probably enough money to get back up to full speed relatively quickly.
---
If they dont want people talking about, dont pit it on a public dev server?
---
Wait, I can get banned from the game for telling my corp to use eveskillboard???
---
.... so then have a friend wait at the sun.
---
Triglavians would disagree with you
---
That's not how NDAs, TOS, EULAs, and invites to alphas work, dipshit.
---
Sure, but I’ve never found the volumes to be that high. Most of my ships don’t survive more than a few fights so all the ammo and paste I use I buy from the trade hub when I buy the original fit. 
---
Try seeding some in a few systems and see how much volume they do
---
Warp a inty to plex warp straight to sun, but that still changes nothing
---
it's no less anecdotal
---
I'm not saying it's incorrect, just that it doesn't mean much
---
but really it's on the guy you replied to for asking for an anecdote
---
Abyssals are the current fotm. Well skilled gilas can pull 300M/hr in complete safety of highsec.
---
Thats pre-nerf super ratting isk. Zero motivation to do anything else.
---
When you say no one did you mean "maybe" no one because i have does cynos on indis for bringing blackops back to stageing for ages
---
Every change worth making affects gameplay. That's the whole point of making changes.
---
Its CCP...
---
Play by hisec rules, win hisec prizes
---
Null tears are delicious. Let's see how the NullBears ruin their own gameplay even further as they "adapt" to these changes.
---
This is exactly my thought on how null should be more group focused pve. I would change your idea slightly to allow for some solo ratting with low isk/h so that yes new players can also live out in null. I think that you also need to accept capitals can be used in ratting but also that they need to have sites designed for them so if you go from a site lvl 1 to be able to be ran in a frig. to lvl 9 group of capitals to run. I would make payouts like incursions though to prevent a single titan from gaming the system.
---
golden
---
PUBLIC. I never signed a NDA to join singularity, i mean this is pretty unclear. Was this on the public dev server?
---
Now this is pod racing
---
if people would have adapted instead of dying their predictions would have been correct.
---
You don't even need a recon alt, just a handful with bricked falcons sitting on a blops ready to bridge in seeing as miners can reship a subcap to a industrial cyno hauler with PANIC invuln from their rorqual.

I just came back from a hiatus and used to JF for Push.  I was considering doing some hauling again, but now I'm gonna wait to see how this shakes out.
---
I know your comment is old, but I am alpha testing eve right now and its not a casual game lol. Still don’t know what tf is going on just like on pc.
---
Going by CCP's estimates this put the former sov null botting faucet at between 9-12T per month out of a "normal" of 60-70 T bounties per month. That's probably an undercount due to real bots being missed by security.
---
No, but Null is hella safe right?

Epic.
---
I apologise, didnt know
---
In fairness, a lot of the tristans seem more afk than bot. Because they often react after 5-10 seconds, making me suspect it's people who launch drones and then alt-tab. Drones deal with rats without input, you tab back if the game makes noises, and tristans are cheap to lose. A 10 min novice plex pays for a dozen, so unless you are getting killed literally every 30 seconds you'll make a profit.
---
Plenty of people do stuff like afk mine, or afk rat, so it stands to reason people would also afk plex.
---
I, too, am enjoying that we get a slice of the TTT.
---
Trying harder is good. Delayed response is also good. Rorqs are still dying though. Not in masse, but they do, either from attrition or straight up torpedoes. This also concerns other ships, not just rorqs. Super ratting, titan ratting suddenly becomes a bit more involved and less brain dead safe.
---
Looks much more balanced now. Nice!

Found an answer to my own question. According to
---
https://powerup-gaming.com/2019/08/30/eve-echoes-is-eve-online-for-mobiles-and-its-in-closed-alpha-right-now/
---
"The alpha is only available to Australian, New Zealand and Nordic players with iPhone 6S and above, Android Samsung Note8, Note9, S8 or S9, Huawei P30 or Google Pixel 2."
---
This is such a shallow way of looking at things. Nearly all of the isk made in wormholes comes from blue loot. In nullsec it's split between bounties, mining, faction loot, LP stores, FOBs and even building supers, none of which is available in wormholes.
---
Well I suppose you can mine there if you have a hard on for high sec moon goo.
---
Yeah, ratting income being closer to the others is a decent outcome. 
---
However, I would have preferred that the mechanism by which that occurred had been actual balance work put into the system instead of people just docking up or not logging in.
---
This is what ccp wants
---
A game so dangerous nothing dies because nobody plays it
---
&gt; leaving the rookie systems
---
don't the rules say that ganking is forbidden in a list of systems, but is legal in the neighbouring ones?
---
I mean we’re talking very minor changes to how umbrellas behave, realistically.  Players will find ways to defend themselves in light of this.
---
It’s bandaid shuffling of the mess rather than actually addressing the problem that rorqs and caps are too powerful at what they do and that umbrellas are too powerful.
---
It’s the classic CCP “balance approach”: move the cheese around but don’t actually make improvements that would benefit the game long term and in ways that make virtually no sense.
---
The panther being superior of course.

Fun fact, if they had managed to kill 1 super they would've been isk positive even if they lost every single bomber. If they had killed a titan, they would've broke even with their whole fleet of 500 people. Stuka fleets price to performance ratio is too good. That is my opinion and you will not change my mind. I've been on both sides of these kinds of fights. It's mainly the fault of command dessies (imo) since it allows you to fit ab instead of mwd and still have pretty much infinite mobility. I would like to see some kind of global cool down on booshes so you cant chain 48 of them together. With 240 bombers and that many command dessies you can spearfish for dreads and faxes easy (as you can see in the BR). And dont tell me scrams counter booshing dessies esp not when you have kikimoras that can track interceptors perfectly at any range and do a million dps.
---
Not always a true statement.
---
Hey, that was me (Aleric) you zapped. Wild to see that encounter on reddit. Thank you for the encouragement that day! Dying is only a waste if i don't learn something, and that encounter helped me learn to stay frosty(er) while ratting. I'm doing more pvp now, hopefully I'm more of a match next time.
---
We're experiencing deflation rn. Declining CPI, declining production, lower velocity of isk.
---
I know CCP employees have said that now that they'd created a bigger isk sink it's time to add some rewards, but they better add them fast, deflation is a bit of a spiral.
---
People cried about inflation because of rising plex prices, but if you look at the CPI it only fluctuated by 5 pts or so over the past 8 or 9 years!!
---
Plex is different than other goods because it isn't generated by player gameplay.
---
Capitals may have some role but I don't want supercaps used in PvE at all, and capital usage be limited. Capitals in PvE are very much a "win more" feedback loop because they are easy to tackle and their safe use is heavily dependent on having local supercap superiority. If you have an uncontestable umbrella you reap the rewards of capital PvE which accelerates buildup of wealth and makes your umbrella even more uncontestable.
---
I would delete all anoms forsaken rally point and above, keep those behind a gate for newbies to rat in without being buttfucked by stealth bombers. Everything else goes to 10 man incursion style sites as detailed above. Escalations are changed to use the Abyssal mechanic to spawn an abyssal deadspace with a C5-sized entrance that you bring an appropriate fleet into (2 caps+ support fleet). At the end of the escalation an exit spawns inside the abyssal back to the entrance and that's where you get jumped if gankers find you.
---
Haven't turned on sound in game in years. Oh well.
---
This is a quality reply. Thanks.
---
Iirc dead heaven syndicate did wormhole things, stumbled upon some goonies and their alts trying to setup for krabbing and batphoned spectre and Therabois on the final timer to shoot some goonies because they were expecting backup (which never showed)
---
If the isk destroyed is roughly the same (slightly more) and the economic activity has dropped a lot, does that mean the people that are trying to rat/mine are still getting their backdoors smashed in as much (slightly more) but for a lot less profit for their troubles?
---
It wasn't impossible to gank people in provi pre-blackout; I lost plenty of ships before blackout, and quite a few after, although the losses after blackout were a bit more frustrating.

I would have chosen

* Significantly increase the sig radius of all capitals and significantly reduce tracking of capital guns.

* Increase fighter MWD cooldown to 5 minutes.

But I'm not CCP and they did it differently.

Does solve the issue of knowing exactly what will come through an industrial cyno. No longer is it a garenteed jump freighter.
---
Yeah, we've been saying that for ages, to the point where it almost became a stale meme. Though as "no local" meme became a reality, I think there's a chance it might come to life now.
---
Love a perspective that wants to invite considering a plurality of factors. It makes it more of a mess to discuss but it's super important to remember to think about things this way, especially on this sub.
---
When you're generally only articulate "one thing" at a time in language, it's really easy to slip into beeline rhetoric / thought patterns; "I want to highlight this particular thing / blacklight a specific lineage of causes" is indiscernable from "I literally think this one thing is The single meaningful problem" when it's staged without enough context and verbal precision.
---
I think that's always been a problem on this subreddit (in gaming subreddits in general, too) and helps account for a lot of the cumulative bitterness and tonal extremism that defines "home" here while being annoying in many different ways in the same breath.
---
The point that stood out the strongest for me (in terms of what the game itself has always had the immediate agency to change) was a fundamental lack, or incomplete/broken implementation of, resource scarcity. IMO, instantly respawning anoms and self-sustaining SP farms have been the two fundamental problem proliferators for the state of the game, and also the two root-cause factors for the experience of Eve becoming eviscerated and more like a Korean grind MMO than the interesting and meaningful transaction of conflict.
---
I agree with a lot of the game-internal and -external factors you mention and to me thinking about Eve in terms of which parts are experientially sustainable or unsustainable has always been a more attractive angle than the perpetually moralised conversation about whether "Eve is dying". The Local shakeup seems to have been huge and beautiful and it's comforting, at least, to see that contribute to a far better legacy than the game would have left in its state a year or two prior.

The Redeemer is beastly...but once it gets "caught" you have limited mobility or other tools to get away.  If you're gameplay is ballsy "All In No Matter What" type drops, then its a fine ship.  The other blops just have more "In the toolbox" so to speak.  At the end of the day though fly what you want, and what gives you the most enjoyment.

Too much ISK around in null for way too little risk for far too long.

Now null bears (6 rorq alts btw) that should never have been in null can't hack it?

Come on dude.
---
I was in a rorqual last night when a manticore decloaked next to me and in jumped 50 bombers, some stratioses, and a Mar5hy.   
---
When my PANIC went down our support fleet came in and the next minute consisted of a tug of war between our FAXes trying to keep me up and Mar5hy's fleet trying to break me. When I finally got enough cap back to cycle my hardeners and reppers (Jesus those focused voids are cancer) I began to hold, but in that time they had gotten me down to 13% structure and I was practically screaming at my ship to hold on. We killed a good portion of their fleet before they left, but I was sweating the whole time.   
---
That was terrifying, but it was also probably the most fun I've had in a month or two playing, so gf again to Mar5hy, and thanks a ton again to the support fleet that managed to save my ass.
---
Yes, I know there are people that just afk plex, but I am referring to like the warp core stabbed Tristans (same fitting over and over and over) that have full red killboards with literally 0 kills on record.

Either way capitals absolutely shrek battleships so having these bonuses wouldn't matter much unless you have a gang of BS. And you only have a gang of BS, generally, in a fleet vs fleet fight.

got some doubt the chaos era is a good thing but it need much more drastic change actually that hurt the game probably more than resurrecting it i guess they wait explosion reduce the isk faucet but this wait hurt much more than rich crab-lord :p

They want nullsec to make a lot less isk so self sustaining alts are replaced by subs. Or keep trying to make isk and get ganked to appease leet game players that buy PLEX.

Hmmm, few ratters die in WH compared to Null, yet WH loot from krabbing almost matches ratting income, with far fewer players to do it with.

Terribly sorry :P
---
Comparing over a five year period in this situation is a statisticaly bad way to do analysis.
---
The big headline battles enticed a lot of new players in at that time, but there was a loss of many long term hisec players around that period.   Most people ignore that as being unimportant or will miss it due to seeing a growing population.   So it is not a surprise that you have no idea about it.

If nullsec isn't self sustaining, and people need to go else where to make money, why would people live in nullsec? What benefit do they get from it?

I mean the moment ccp implied they would make it easier to attack into wormholes from null, wormholers took to reddit crying about why nerf wormholes. So ya they pretend to love chaos but when it makes their safe space vulnerable that tune changes real fast.

Maybe Eve should make losses more meaningful?  Unlimited ISK faucets tend to lead to out of control SRP programs.  Combat might go down, but losses become more meaningful.

Sorry. I'll come up with some convoluted and internally inconsistent ideas later.
---
thats called plex
---
Do you people seriously think that every and all pilots who mine or rat are truly bots? Or is it just a cool buzzword meme? Similar to your “this is a PvP game!” meme?
---
I’m seriously wonder. Because every time anything related is discussed or even mentioned the first thing out of y’alls mouth is “Bot!” or “AFK”. It’s fucking annoying.
---
They are fantastic, it's just that HAW dreads are usually even better.
---
When are we actually going to get a half decent release with actual content, instead of shit minor updates all the time....
---
Well, if theyve made so much already, they can float it out and see if they can go back to their old ways.
---
having talked in local to about 90% of nullsec I agree with your statistic.
---
Love that artist. Have had their astero piece as my laptop wallpaper for years.
---
I see where you are coming from. I do not think that capitals standard or supers should be restricted from pve. Someone posted above about a whole sale nerf on ehp and dps of capitals that I think would be a better fix then preventing from being used in a section of the game.
---
I can’t entirely agree because I’m more into bringing the right blops for the right situation. I personally main a cheap Sin that I sometimes bridge with and sometimes blops with. I have flown a panther but I feel like I get better performance out of the Sin for my style. My group typically runs armor blops for certain reasons (occasionally using them for tackle) so the sin is pretty balanced for having all those utility kids and good tank. I literally fly a 2b fit so it’s easily replaceable and I don’t really have to think too hard about jumping in. It just sucks for all my more blingy friends that want to hang out because I’ll take more baity situations a lot. 
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/2070762456/ main
---
The best part about blops is hunting. The actual battleship is basically the same as a dread alt. HKs is where it’s at. You know you’re good when you can literally look at a region and you immediately know where everything is going on and where you aren’t going to have any luck hunting. My only wish is that I was a little more nomadic than I am now. It’s super easy to farm a group so hard that the only thing they undock is vexors. =P
---
&gt;Nearly all of the isk made in wormholes comes from blue loot.
---
no it doesn't.
---
The other guy up there \^ called it a grind fest. I was simply pointing out that given CCP's under performance when it comes generating new players and keeping them, combined with the current large loss of players will most likely drive the new owners towards replacing hilmar once the one year sale bonus window ends.
---
&gt; Correct. Tested it on sisi, it works for bridging, too.
---
Bridging what... exactly?
---
Not entirely but it's free ~~real estate~~ content for them.
---
I expected something more interesting. How about an anti-fighter point defence module with decent range?
---
There's other games they could move to and RMT in, though.
---
Yeah, care to point me to some actual cases of that? I seem to have missed such crying.
---
Thanks to moon mining now being available in HiSec, I do all of my mining in HiSec, sucking up ABCs and the precious Spodumain and Gneiss.
---
regarding 1: battleships can't be regarded heavy tackle in cap fights. atm rorquals are often used as heavy tackle on cap level. In some instances supers. So if you already use a super instead of a simple carrier what does that tell you about how heavy I consider your battleship.
---
regarding 2: The neut amount of bhaalgorns is already fine. One Bhaalgorn with 7 heavy neuts does 43.8*7 = 306.6 cap pressure. Capital peak capacitor regen is between 50 and 100. A T2 Capital cap booster with faction 3200s gives 6*3200/(6*12+10) = 234.14 cap (cold). So a single full neut bhaal can negate those. The huge capacitor pool of a capital is a thing though. It would take a good bit to get it dry. But usually caps need a lot of cap to function and rarely enter a fight even close to full cap. People know all this and already use bhaals to neut caps. Against a single capital that works very nicely. But if there are a bunch of caps the bhaals just die to quickly. No chance to even rep them because they just get volleyed.
---
Just to explain why we can directly move forward from those suggestions without even looking at the details.
---
You're apparently comfortable with having no values whatsoever. Serious question if you don't mind: Why do you choose to live/keep on living?
---
Yes, but it's also much higher than all the monthly averages for the previous quarterly reports, which never exceeded 2.8k as far as I can tell. It is of course possible that one of those quarters had one month with &gt;7k bans and two with 1k or so, but that seems pretty unlikely.
---
Largest would be the mighty Orca.
---
HAW should have been lone gone. Nerf cap EHP is an issue without looking at doomsdays. Just delete HAWs then iterate...
---
Well yes, but you'd assume the payouts in NS would scale with the effort put into it. If a group is putting a lot of isk into building their own setup, you'd want to get isk out of it.
---
I run an orca in hi sec on moons. If you’ve got the time and access to consistent moon pops you can make a lot of isk. However, if you’re comparing numbers, I don’t think the net is as good as why can be gotten in low/null. I’m weird and don’t care about making huge profits, so the slower income is fine for me.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cuei8z/wait_what_did_ccp_hellmar_and_ccp_burger_just_say
---
this
---
I forgot about the barghest. However, just like the bhaalgorn, it doesn’t necessarily have to allow bonuses to apply to it. If it stayed fairly vanilla, it’s much easier to deal with the outliers.
---
That being said, with all the links and implants, the maximum difference comes out be an extra 2.5km. Don’t know if mutaplasmids work on heavy scramblers, but it’s possible to get those ranges as it is with normal faction scramblers.
---
It could definitely have its niche applications, but I don’t think it’s very groundbreaking in of itself.
---
Goons generally enjoy the blackout. Not sure where that's coming from.
---
Or maybe they are still casing the bot ring to squash them all at once, and any account connected to them.
---
Yea, I forgot to mention that I have perfect skills too; for absolutely everything. I never have to worry about damage except when I get neuted out. The AB is fast enough, I overheat it sometimes and use a Packrat Mobile Depot to collect loot, I have no problem getting 100% of the loot. A microwarp means more damage to your ship because it balloons your sig radius. Plus I'm cap stable. The key to you doing better honestly might just be having better skills. Implants help a lot too, but make dying even more painful. As you can see from my KB, I have lost quite a number of Gilas, lol. I lost two recently trying to master that god damn 15 Leshak rare spawn (only possible with chaotic filament).
---
Personally I really prefer the active tank, although yes, you rely more on cap to keep you up; no cap = pretty quickly dying. 
---
I honestly think CCP should narrow or limit some of the randomness with spawns, it's really frustrating if you ask me to have 100 rooms you can clear easily, but then just one round of bad luck (with a random super neut heavy spawn) that can kill you. 
---
By the way, I also use no drugs, but always carry a Cap boosting pill for that 1 in 100 really bad neuting rooms.
---
Ok, thanks guys.  Yeah, lower profit isn't really a big deal for me.  I'd do it for the relaxation.  Is it hard to find these moons to mine?
---
Glad you are enjoying watching eve spiral even further down due to chaos changes.
---
I am a relatively new player who plays in null sec.  Until recently I was also a PAYING player who was happy to spend a reasonable amount of cash on this game.  I am not going to stop playing but I am going to stop paying.    I am not sure that the best way to treat a stagnant pond is to set it on fire.
---
So you want people out in battleships fighting capitals?  Lol ok
---
Why are you being downvoted? Easy as hell to gank a roller with a boosher and a buddy.
---
That's not how that works.
---
Be the change you want!!!
---
Eat shit CCP; survey that...
---
Yes! Guard their hole when they try to run back to it you gank them. You could also roll their hole. WHs appear in null. Rolling is something NS bros should learn about.
---
Amen to that. This is kinda why i left null for WH in the first place - you you get much more interaction in a small close group than in krab korp.
---
What if your 'gameplay' was the problem?
---
That's an evidence based conclusion that whatever CCP did in the last 3 months caused a FIVE THOUSAND AVERAGE PLAYER DROP in activity. 
---
Maybe im just shortsighted, but I see a 22% drop in activity as a bad thing. Do you disagree? 
---
Please reply with what evidence backed conclusions you have that the blackout is good for eve.
---
&gt;the things he represents.
---
not really, prior to running for CSM he had and still has a well established and repeated grr goons leaning, both on reddit and his twitch channel which were focused on that almost exclusively.
---
actually safer just to leave provi and go under and larger/more powerful supercap umbella, if your going to mine, or move to low/high sec. have seen 3x as many people in high sec ice belts in domian since the black out. so all you did really was shift those who took the risk to live in harder to live places (like providence) and move them to more risk averse areas if they are still even loggin in at all.
---
You can already fit capital scrams to barghests. Faction scrams are just better unless you use officer scrams (which yes, you can still fit).
---
See below
---
No, not really.  Find a .5 system, warp the all the athanors, you'll find plenty of high end ore.

shoutout to that guy's friend in the 1.2b phantasm
---
&gt; Industrial cynos can be given god mode by a PANIC, can be used on low sp proc alts (reship into badger/nereus from SMA) and allows you to blops bridge/jump a bricked cyno blops/recon then a FAX to your rorqual. It's a huge buff for umbrellas compared to the initial proposal.
---
This is actually really huge.
---
Yes. Assault Frigate so fun.
---
How about some love for T1 frigates? We have a bunch of T1 frigates but no one flies them because you're gonna feed to Comets, Daredevils, Hookbils, Slicers, etc.
---
yo t1 BS spam instead of cap spam would actually be an improvement
---
Why would you respond to a sentence which you clearly are not understanding.
---
Then please clarify? Because it appears that after the summit you believe ccp could hide information from the players to defend a decision they know is damaging their game. And that should be extremely concerning.
---
for now, i suppose. that will at some point drop off when enough people have decided that enough is enough and or the fighting over providence has finished (but the isk destroyed will continue to be that for awhile i suppose).
---
not sure if its the most dangerous i mean the front between test/frat has a lot of action at least in what i can see from brs and isk losses.
---
Yeah right, all you guys want is easy kills on miners. Blackout is ruining the game and I'm pissed because my focus on the game has to be 100% when I am trying to enjoy my favorite episode of the bachelor.
---
Surely you think that [this graph](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/6dHbnSUciAqcK26S8k0CEk/3394808882ca8867aec9122e331bf959/9a_sinksfaucets.png) from August 2018 depicts unhealthy economy right? 
---
When I look at the sinks and faucets in this 2019 report I see a much more healthy virtual economy. And seeing as the economy is a huge chunk of the game, having it out of wack is not good. Even if a contingent of players are mad that they can no longer rat their way into a Nyx as easily in null.
---
Sure that works good. My manticore has rockets and blasters since it has 3 launcher and 2 turret hard points. You have to pre-scan the sites to do it that way but with mobile depots that's easy and having the sites prescanned works better than probing while someone is watching anyway.
---
Yes, it’s not intended to entirely close the gap between caps and BS, but it should shrink it a bit. Somewhere between BS Vs Dread honor duel and massive cap brawls, there should be plenty of space for a change like this to make a difference.
---
Feel free to check out Talking in Stations, where you can hear Matterall jerk off The Mittanti (who he knows btw) and any other EmPiRe BuIlDeR, Carneros act as though because he worked at CCP like a decade ago he knows how they operate and what they'll likely do, Exookiz try to make people care about wspace, Artemis pretend he didn't turn into a carebear, RonUSMC attempt to make TAPI come off as good, and Ashterothi be a wholesome and loveable lore dork. Or join their Discord where you can be ignored or harassed for disagreeing with the NULL ELITE.
---
I'm 99% sure that whoever proposed this used some retarded logic such as `bridging blockade runners` or some similarly fucked logic and CCP failed to actually think about the consequences such a change could have. Meh.
---
Guess they didn't want null to be hard.
---
and ? the game was healthy before the blackout ? no obviously not something need to be done and the blackout is a part of that but CCP need to speed up the process not stoping it
---
Does anyone do old-school mining in hisec now, or do they all do moon mining?
---
That sentence was a response to people believing that CCP is not only hiding information from people but also internally. Those people think this incompetence explains why blackout still lasts.
---
I am trying to say they aren't stupid or incompetent, and they are looking at relevant data.
---
I didn't realize the penguin posted this. :P
---
The best nerf is a nerf to Cap EHP. Keep the damage just make em squishier for more explosions.
---
Shit's fun. Why do you assert I have no values?
---
are explo bot even in the report.    They got ratting incursion project discovery yadda yadda but did not see anything that would be explo
---
Ventures are no longer able to capture Faction Warfare Complexes.
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
The most interesting stat is the graph shown at the end. Approximately 300-400 bil ISK / day was being generated by bots and it seems that they now generate less than 50bil/day on most days. Props to the CCP security team for getting the ISK injected daily so low.
---
yes but large plex one. u can put there evry ship.
---
Wasn't so hard then, was it? :)))
---
I didn't say he wasn't.
---
But being grr goons doesn't mean his ideas are bad.
---
Dominix can still be effective pretty much like a decade ago. Then you can upgrade to pirate ship like Rattlesnake or Vindicator as you get appropriate skills
---
Ot just says bots banned.
---
That was me as well.
---
Supercapitals are strategic assets. If you make strategic assets also "investments" that can pay for themselves over time directly, you create a massive snowball problem. A fundamental part of government budgeting is the "guns vs butter" problem, where investment into guns hurts in the long term because the people want butter. In EVE guns are also butter because Supers and Titans are fantastic ratting platforms that increase the direct productivity of your member, so over time the guns pay for themselves which allows you to buy more guns without ever harming your long term economy. That's the true cause of supercapital proliferation, because they are long term profitable and the ultimate say in warfare.
---
That's makes more sense, but the line about them potentially hiding and doubling down on things damaging the game concerns me. August MER has no supported Hilmar's assertion of record levels of activity so everything is a grain of salt.
---
There's a good portion who definitely do not. No need to spin that bit.
---
However the login averages for the last 30 days are 19k. The 6 month spread is 27k. Maybe that's the blackout, maybe it's not. In either case the activity nose dived hard, recently.
---
Pcu is not the only relevant metric here. It is only one of the hundreds of relevant variables that happens to be public.
---
I am not defending everything is well and good either. But I can't go to more nuance ans details without breaching nda.
---
Honestly would it break them? I don’t think so right?
---
Im sory, its a bait post or?
---
Hey, thanks for the kind words. I am working on my next video/s right now, so I'm hopeful I'll get something out soon. 
---
As far as how you should go about finding a good group to fly with. I think there are three key factors:
---
1. Do they do what you want to do?
---
2. Are there enough active members during your available time to play to do the things you want to do?
---
3. Are you of the same approximate skill level as the people in the group? Way more experienced or way less than the group and you'll be frustrated one way or another.
---
Further than that, find a friend you fly with a lot and join corps with that person. That way you always have at least one person in your corner and hopefully available to fly with. 
---
I think there are a lot of corps that suffer from overly bureaucratic leaders who implement unnecessary rules and systems because they feel that is their job as the leader of the corp. A guy with 10 people in his corp probably doesn't need to authenticate teamspeak access via a website for example. To me, that tends to be a sign that a person is roleplaying as a leader instead of actually leading.
---
That's just me saying that at worst they could do that (I don't believe they are) but that's not enough to say blackout lasts because internal incompetence.
---
I should have worded that paragraph a bit differently. Sorry for the misunderstanding.
---
There's not reason to use the things when Stealth Bomber can do comparable damage from farther away while being easier to extract and 3% of the price and requiring much lower skills to get into.
---
inb4 some1 sells  a battleship with small med large ancillary
---
What's your evidence backed reason for seeing the blackout as good? 
---
Im seeing a 5000 average drop right as that happened. 
---
Please provide evidence backing up your conclusion that the blackout is good. I did it for my conclusion that it's bad.
---
nothing wrong with some good ol' belt mining. especialy if isk per h aint the problem.
---
there was somewhere crashed anathema
---
NC member mining in higsec due to blackout.
---
Understandable, given you just left the summit paired with that line seemed extremely bad.
---
&gt; I'm 99% sure that whoever proposed this used some retarded logic such as bridging blockade runners or some similarly fucked logic and CCP failed to actually think about the consequences such a change could have. Meh.
---
From what I understand, PANIC won't apply to any ship that can use an industrial cyno.  Only the hauler type indies can fit them, but PANIC only applies to mining type indies, does it not?  That's what I'm understanding from ppl I'm talking to about this.
---
I know a friend who left. His reasoning... he didn't feel safe in null sec anymore. That's what you're going to hear from everyone. And guess what, that's fine by me. You shouldn't feel safe. 
---
If your alliance consolidates and keeps up standing fleets. You'll be fine. But if you think you can solo some distant system all day and be safe, then bye bye. I don't miss you.
---
Uedama?
---
Nothing to do with blackout
---
mega &gt; super or super &gt; mega or mega = super?
---
That means how many more months until the boys are all gone? Should be all done in 6 months or so right?
---
Only took 15 years but the boys are almost all gone guys!
---
So yet another alt in a recon has to babysit krabbers. I think you overestimate the organization of the big alliances.
---
&gt;You could also roll their hole
---
Critting the hole could be more fun. :) I can say as a wormholer that if whether or not we're vigilant enough to catch that it has been critted, this would be really exciting. You might split the fleet and catch some easy kills, and feel really clever while doing it. Or at least you make the decisions hard for the retreating group.  
---
\&gt; WHs appear in null. Rolling is something NS bros should learn about.
---
Absolutely. If they naturally did this, things would be very different for both of us.
---
Null seems empty
---
Highsec seems empty
---
Fewer people are logging in.
---
This seems bad to me.
---
Provide evidence to back up your conclusions.
---
If you don't, you are asking us to trust you, AGAINST evidence and personal experience. You have not earned that trust currently. Earn it by proving you are right with hard data.
---
I second this totally unsupported statistic. I too talk shit in null and rarely if ever get responses. Same thing in much of low and high tbf.
---
Lol. Spot on. Though Matteral jerks off Hilmar and Falcon now. Pretty sure he’s now on good terms with Mittens anymore, could be wrong. 
---
Carneros is alright. He’s just like the old dude at work. 
---
Exookis alright, Ron’s alright.
---
Artemis is ok, although he does have a massive vocal crutch with the constant use of “fricken” and he always seems like he’s got a huge fucking shit eating grin when he talks. 
---
And Ash needs to stick with lore, it’s fricken bad when he tries to talk about anything else.
---
The effect from this module applies to subcapital mining and `hauling ships` in the same fleet as the activating Rorqual. Does not apply to other Rorquals. 
---
Affected ships gain incredible shield resistances, but lose the ability to deal damage, cloak, warp, dock, tether, or jump. Other effects include increased mass, decreased velocity and decreased scan resolution.
---
hmmm i wonder if he's been paid off by the Null CSMs

&gt;StainGuy  
---
  
---
no, its a badpost
---
The problem is. They're all "alright" at things, but act like subject matter experts. I'm not entirely sure Matterall has even fucking played the game. Ash usually just sticks to lore and PVE and RP stuff, I don't really feel like he's ever asserted his stance as "correct" on things out of his wheel house.
---
I can't talk to you about data because I am under nda.
---
I can provide you an argument. CCP likes money. CCP is not incompetent. CCP wouldnt keep a mechanic in the game if all it did was hurting the game. So there must be other reasons why it's still in the game.
---
It was painted in Illustrator, using mostly the pen tool, trying my hand at something different. :)
---
Flat Earth Society has members all around the globe you know!
---
At the very least it means a recon kill for the attackers, they'd have enough time to kill the recon and warp off before the supers arrive. Compared to now where they get supers dropped and leave.
---
And then the attackers just come back an hour later and kill another recon.
---
It's going to be pretty expensive for miners, recons aren't cheap.
---
You can't just scan using the window and hotkeys. You have to manipulate the probes locations in relation the the signature you're going to scan to get a scan result.
---
K? NC. feeds something stupid somewhere stupid.
---
It’s all moon.  Npc’s drain the other belts fairly fast.
---
Got a link?
---
Before any of you say, "ugh, Uedama, that's not affected by the blackout," StainGuy is noting that he's there instead of in null as a result of the blackout; i.e. StainGuy = genius playing 4D chess!
---
This is what happens when you understand industry but not PVP.
---
Along these lines, I’m considering a 0.5 mining empire of 56 public moons, local refinery and low taxes with rolling 56 day pulls.  
---
It would survive (fuel) on donations and the low refinery taxes.  
---
Any interest?
---
Yup, CCP confirmed retardo
---
after the cynochanges they will actually be usefull for once lol...
---
Hmmm, should my alt be in a fax or force recon. Decisions decisions. Think I’ll play WoW.
---
He really wasn't elected on a platform of 'grr goons' and trying to claim that he is makes you an unreliable propagandist.
---
I don't even know of any other MMOFPS except maybe Arma. Maybe their trying to poach a specific talent.
---
There already are incursions in null, aren't there? Are you talking about widespread similar sites everywhere in null, respawning so they can be farmed harder?
---
It's a fairly good idea because being deadspace with a gate means you can't spam caps and you can't cyno a gank blops fleet inside.
---
Whatever can take the bridge, so anything with a covops cloak
---
As only JFs and Blops can jump to them I'd imagine only the Blops have access when it comes to bridging ships to them, so general blops stuff.
---
Now we just need to fix the DRB AI so you can't farm them with Astras.
---
K cool the convenience of lower risk. So if we get rid of cloaks it's just an inconvenience. No big deal?
---
5000 *characters*. If a significant number of those are bots or multiboxing VNI characters, that's fine, and doesn't actually reduce real activity.
---
Theres another argument you are not using.
---
CCP is prideful. They are known to not back down from bad decisions they've made in the past. 
---
Additionally, the core stakeholders at CCP are cashing out in October when the year long PA acquisition bonuses are awarded. 
---
If key stakeholders get a massive benefit from certain metrics, and not from anything past a certain date, what reason would they have to focus on anything besides those certain metrics. Why would they care about long term health if they can cash out soon. 
---
You are asking us to trust you and you have NOT EARNED IT.
---
Earn it by providing evidence for your positions.
---
Part of the fun of not posting mine is seeing if it ever pops up on here from another redditor
---
these ideas get somehow more retarded every day
---
I've got money that says a Goon member on the CSM proposed this already thinking ahead to the ramifications. Goons meta CCP again.
---
" Does seem odd for a cyno that they created explicitly for JFs and cyno vigils though. "
---
Seem pretty typical actually, they added the new thing and didn't bother to think about the other things already in the game and how they would interact, that's par for the CCP course.
---
No player count has not dropped by any significant margin just because of blackout, just stop it, it's starting to turn into a meme.
---
Command ships should be able to light cynos as well vOv
---
Ah, the olden days. Not just long alpha tests but also multiple multi-month phases of beta prior to launch.
---
That basically makes blackout meaningless.
---
I don't do it, but I think AFK Orca mining is popular. If you're keen on high sec that's how I would recommend doing it. In that way you're not spending a lot of time/effort on it, so the relative slower rate is balanced by playing for longer, which is easier because you're mostly AFK.
---
How nice to see you're still active here. We still should do a beer, you've not been close to Amsterdam right? :)
---
ventures banned from running FW sites
---
i'v said it was needed not "good" in order to be "good" they need to adress other issue like 100% safe umbrella super/rorqual farming and a complete rework of fozziesov / anom spawn and that include a drastic increase in bounties reward   
---
i will be glad if they completly change the risk/reward in game and just get rid of asset safety, easy to get isk, more fight more destruction less asset but just blackout is a incomplete change that hurt players more than ressurecting Eve BUT blackout is a part of a new Eve i want to see
---
Delete this
---
How the hell are you getting downvoted lmao
---
sure, im all for it. cloaks are aids.
---
The state of the game's coalitions is a symptom, a telltale sign by which to judge the times, not the cause itself.
---
It sounds like a space ship version of wow.
---
Lol what?
---
Anyone with a brain that will be rorq mining or super ratting will have a cloaked recon with a cyno near by.
---
UK are the only exception I'm aware of but yeah, no custom plates for the rest of us in EU I think.
---
Apex Legends or Overwatch, Dust edition.
---
Sooo.. is your Capsuleer invincible? Or can the person. And their skills be killed?
---
people also play a lot less now too.
---
Does this just remove the log entry, or does this mean the data is no longer sent to the client? If only the former, then presumably anyone inspecting memory directly in EVE client can still see this happening.
---
We're still in the Bargaining stage?
---
It would help if Mittens hasn't acted like a cunt over the years. I'm sure he's friendly to those he likes, but honestly a lot of people just don't like him and it translates to their opinions of the broader Imperium and their allies.
---
I know this post isn't real because the very highest authorities say everyone has left EvE, or has moved to HS and that the only thing happening in NS is fleets of thousands of risk averse bomber pilots are ganking hapless solo procurer miners.  And they can prove you are an eve shill-bot and are not having fun with player count statistics.
---
It's amazing that I've never seen a post of his not downvoted.
---
Malware highjacked botfarms
---
And yet the playerbase was at it's highest and there were constant wars.
---
Oh god, that's just...no. There are better ways to make a unique model for the Bhaalgorn than that.
---
The Armageddon already looks like a fat and stubby arrow, spear, or some other polearm, so run with that. Make the "head" of the ship look like an actual blade by thinning it out and giving it sharp edges, then thicken the primary hull to make it look more solid before adding the flukes/fins/blades like what's in that concept piece.
---
3 mins from i post untill your briliant comment. Im guessing you are not busy playing EVE.
---
May I ask why you don't like his Eve persona?
---
&gt; There already are incursions in null, aren't there?
---
Incursions in null are extremely unreliable because if it doesn't spawn in your space or allied space, you can't get to it and spend weeks twiddling your thumbs waiting for one to respawn in a location that is convenient. Also if the current incursion spawns in some place like dronelands it's not going to get completed and just sit there until it despawns. You might get one incursion in farmable space every couple months.
---
&gt; Are you talking about widespread similar sites everywhere in null, respawning so they can be farmed harder?
---
Yep, changing the main method of farming in null from supercaps in anoms to battleships in sites. You leave a handful of slowly spawning low-end sites in each system for newbies to farm. Once they are able to fly a tech 2 fit T1 battleship or Tech 2 logi they should swap to group sites.
---
Each constellation gets 1 permanent site that always respawns somewhere else in the constellation upon completion, people who are in the site at completion get a popup saying where the next site is. This requires very frequent gating to get to the next site and bots are very very bad at dealing with gatecamps in things that can't warp cloaked.
---
Sadly I am not. I'm on the other side of the ocean, but I'll raise one in your direction this weekend.
---
Ina. Blackout that only exists for 48 hours, Krabs will just not login for 48 hours meaning there isn't a reason to really hunt or adapt.
---
The permanence of blackout is a major factor in what makes it a part of a balanced nullsec.
---
Then why don't you come to wspace instead of bitching about it? The more the merrier.
---
I think that CCP just did a dangerous bet. Maybe they hoped that it will make the "bad" players leave, and the old bittervets who left all this years would come back and easily compensate the departures.
---
Fact is, it is not. For obvious reasons for anyone with a decent IQ.
---
So well, I can't wait to see people like you in the next months whining in reddit/eve forums because all "pussies" dared take refuge in high-sec instead of "playing the game as it should" (what game ?) and so you won't have targets anymore. Even if you don't see any problem in wasting hours to kill nothing at the end because too much players left the game, I doubt that the shareholders will agree with you.
---
It will happen, mark my words. This because the risk-adverse PVP players wanted easy targets... without realizing that null-sec didn't become like this in a day. It was a constant effort and work who is criticized by the now risk-free PVP players, ironicaly. This, and multiple wrong choices from CCP done to make the game easier, like the reduction of the pre-requisites for using capital ships in 2011 (and many more of the sort who permitted capital proliferation and coalition-size operations).
---
But well, I can't blame you, it is human nature to be jealous and greedy. The only bad point in this story is that CCP listened to it.
---
The Blackout is a failure. You are just too elite to realize it.
---
But well... I will stay until the death of the game, just for the pleasure to say "I told you so" before leaving.
---
Agreed. This situation reminds me almost of [the WW1 naval situation involving Dreadnoughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFZXdyGlJy0) where nations kept building bigger ships constantly until air power based force projection became more of a thing.
---
I don't think CCP will ever achieve ship balance by constantly adding 'bigger ships', as you can't make anything 'so big' that its impossible to find ways to efficiently factorize it.
---
I hope this game works for some nice publicity to get more players to join eve-online
---
Please join us in wspace. Since it's the safest space in the game and the most isk, I don't see why you wouldn't join us. The more the merrier.
---
Well I promised you a beer, so whenever you're around in A'dam, let me know ;)
---
I bet you could put up a prediction market for it on Augur.
---
When you nerf the game so hard everyone picks up their ball, goes home and doesn't log back in it gets really difficult to kill them.
---
&gt;Increase fighter MWD cooldown to 5 minutes.
---
Enough with the nerf ideas that'll fuck up regular carriers even more.
---
Having light fighters unable to catch up with a frigate, in addition to dealing less damage than light drones is a garbage idea.
---
I mean, the other side is "WHO THE FUCK NEEDS CAREBEARS WHO PAY ROUGHLY HALF THE SUBS?"
---
While I would probably agree with your anecdote, I will leave you with this worrying piece of data:

Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

Bye!

But by that logic, if its permanent they will never log in..

---
Incorrect. They will adapt.
---
A short term blackout with a warning will make them stop for the period and come back when its over.
---
&gt; People complain ~~when their game play style is nerfed~~.
---
FTFY.
---
There's a contingent who know the Right Way To Play Eve, and are upset that other people can play in a way that's Not Right.
---
Some things that are Not Right: Incursion-running, flying industrials through lowsec with the correct fitting and enough skill to not get ganked by the first gatecamp you run into, mining, FW missions.
---
I mean, when numbers tip against a WH group, they are limited by mass restrictions. They literally have to choose to stay and lose or run and try and fight a smaller force brave enough to chase them through gates and a WH. If Nullbears want to agree to match-up, then I'm sure they'd stay. Dropping Supers on a smaller force or bringing 2-5x their number (mb more?) isn't really fun, is it? Shouldn't be fun for either side. Unless you like stepping on bugs and laughing about your might.
---
WHs enforce a max level of content, but that is between WH groups. When the fight goes into NS or LS, things can tip because one side isn't limited unless they chase into WH territory.
---
Gudfights are the best content.
---

Come on man, that's plainly untrue. Most big blocks have plenty of senior members with way too much ego to join another block. There'll always be division because some people like windmilling their schlongs about the place. Mittens isn't the driver, the size of goons is. Everyone loves to hate the massive corporations.
---
&gt;Maybe Eve should make losses more meaningful?
---
yeah that's what we need, ANOTHER reason for people to not log in. We are already down to 26,000 ish people at peak time on Sunday, compared to 36,000 ish at peak times as recent as April, why not cut a few thousand more off?
---
They either adapt or never log in again. Or leave for hisec. Either way, good for the game.
---
I don’t think it would break them. I mean the hulls are expensive as heck, so why not let them have a little more survivability?  Their role is already kinda diminished due to covert t3cs and stealth bombers.
---
A combat cyno for caps is a dead blops every time.  Even a non combat cyno to move caps would be silly. Especially since they can’t warp cloaked.
---
Do you mean 1.144 T?
---
I strongly disagree but i gues we will see in the coming months.

It's almost as if we're not obligated to entertain each and every person demanding someone play with them.

Losing the war is relative to who is speaking about a side losing a war. From the outside, I joined in the middle and don’t have any real stake in it other than not wanting to play a dead game, which it’s been exactly the opposite due to the war and I love it. And in the end victory is determined by multiple factors to the parties involved since test can say the claimed ~10 systems in their campaign and had some content.While Winter.co can claim we’ve held our ground and push invaders and won the war of attrition at 2-1 or more odds against us outside of our strongest TZ.

That's a lot of cheese.

I'm a really nice guy irl I'll have you know!

your point?

Mach bump their ass till they're 200k off any rocks? Time your chunks to your own active play windows?
---
You can sell at a premium in FW areas, but the market turnover is quite low by comparison to a hub. I have some orders up in a fairly active place, and the rate is basically a trickle. A batch of paste that would have sold out overnight at Jita is still more than half-unsold, a month after I last updated the price.
---
If you can make paste at scale, sell it at a hub.
---
Thanks for all the support on the video and for everybody that is subbing to the channel!

Oh okay, yeah if you are under 5kk SP then no need I suppose. And yes daily injectors are way more isk efficient than omega or the other injectors under 5kk SP

Is this the amount of sites being ran?
---
How hard do you want to grind?
---
Broker fees are 3.5% with max skills. You can get it down to 3% with perfect standings with the NPC station owner and faction. That's a lot of grinding.
---
&gt;not all that long before the game started coalescing into a handful of major supercap umbrellas.
---
If you're going to insinuate that the fatigue changes led to supercap umbrellas you should probably mention the major application buffs, supercap docking, rorqs, skill injectors and practically unlimited supercap build slots through citadels, which all came *after* the fatigue changes.
---
You asserted there can be no rational values, so by definition, you can't have any. (One could argue about irrational values, but that's a self-defeating discussion - why have a rational discussion if your position is that it is rationally no point to having the discussion?)
---
So, "fun" is your ultimate pursuit in life, then?
---
Its a justification and nothing more. As long as they call all the miners and ratters leaving the game "bots" then "nothing of value was lost" and they don't need to feel concerned that from April to September we went from 36,000+ at peak times on a sunday to just a bit over 26,000 on a sunday. If any other game's player base watched almost 30% of their games players stop logging in over a 3 month period there would be a panic that the game is dying, eve players just ignore it based on this idiotic notion that CCP knows what they are doing, even though Hilmar was recently honest enough to admit they have no idea what they are doing on his official twitter account.
---
No one wants to really fight over Provi. They just like getting fed Dreads.

Will just have to wait and hope next year, Jimmy.

recon can move, so when you put inhib up, recon just move to corner of inhib and fire cyno too ;-)
---
EVE University has a HighSec mining campus where they munch on Ice, Ore and Moon Goo all day long.
---
I always wonder about people that say this kind of thing. Gudfights are one type of good content, being sneaky and cunning enough to bait someone into a fight they can't possibly win is another kind of perfectly legitimate and also fun content. 
---
It's not always about being the better pilot, it can also be about being one step ahead in the escalation. Nothing quite like popping a few and bolting before they escalate further than you can.
---
you say that every time its pointed out that bots can reroll in minutes... I think we finally found the hilmar sock puppet accounts folks.
---
2 statics, TWICE THE CONTENT!!!
---
Guess capital kills aren’t content huh?
---
Except the ISK printers are the only ones left. *They* account for the remaining value. (They being the supers ratting under super umbrellas, absolutely untouched by the blackout.)
---
I mean, the only thing you show is the drop in nullsec bounties.
---
Not quite, my point was there are no universal values. Of course I have my own. 
---
Yes, essentially.
---
Not when they don't occur because the second someone enters the next region over the whole alliance docks up.
---
so go to highsec, make an alpha hauler bot and run courier missions 24/7 with zero risk because who is going to waste time ganking a mission runner in a cheap hauler with nothing valuable in it, and if you are already cheating why not just use VM's to run a bunch of alphas all on one computer?
---
They finally Made a good change and fixed nullec
---
Yeah, same as can be done currently. 
---
The point of the inhib is to force backup to come in at range or not at all. 
---
Inhibs will still keep people from bridging or dropping on top of you. 
---
So what the fuck is the point of this post?
---
other games actually bother to appoint a meaningful number of people to combat that.
---
Olmeca - please do not engage the trolls.  We need different perspectives to move the game forward.  Just keep moving forward and let your work speak for itself.
---
Yeah Blackout isn't doing anything to curb capital growth. CCP act like they don't know how to bottleneck super production. But then we have ships like the Revenant. Vendetta. Molok. Aren't these prime examples of what they had initially envisioned for super capitals? Are they saying they still can't figure it out when they've already unwittingly pulled it off?
---
i managed to get myself a new, more interesting and better paying position as a sysadmin. starting this december if all goes according to plan. excited as hecc 
---
( ╹▽╹ )
---
also i love eve
---
when you see players count and last MER, there will be very few cap fights and use of inhib will fall rapidly
---
I laugh because in a few months when you see that people just rather not grind or pay for something, will just be everything is boring. Adapt or die only works if there isn't something else you can't alt-tab to when it's boring.
---
I would like to welcome you all to the Serenity 2.0 show.
---
&gt;Mach bump their ass till they're 200k off any rocks
---
Might wanna check the patch notes.
---
&gt; We can see by looking at the graph below that a combination of the blackout as well as a renewed focus on hammering these kinds of illicit behaviors into the ground have had a massive impact on the amount of ISK being poured into the economy of New Eden by suspected botters.
---
Well the point is to also get newer players that will replace the ones who dont adapt.
---
They banned 8k bot accounts in August. That's a crazy high number. I think it is legitimately hard to figure out what is happening with real player numbers with that context.
---
This Blackout sure showed those bots huh. They couldn't have possibly outwitted CCP at all.
---
Assuming actual players are being lost and not just whiny cunts that inflate the economy and do nothing else.
---
Boy you're stupid
---
Why should fighters be able to catch up to a frigate? Shouldn't shipping down to something smaller and faster be valid counterplay to capitals?
---
That's your definition of crying? lmao
---
It's truly mind boggling.
---
That's a cruel joke using an image of a spreadsheet.  I spent a lot of time trying to scroll.
---
Nobody every comes to fight my Sleipnir. They always come to fight my Excavators. Something something doing their part to save Eve. How noble.
---
it certainly does for high class corps haha
---
actual use of inhib is only to force rorquals or ratting caps to do no fire cyno, tactical use in cap fights is close to zero, because there are no capital fights around
---
Or you could git gud, quit crying and keep an eye on D-Scan...
---
That's only if they're trying to warp right?
---
Yea most of the kills in Provi are from timers and such. There's practically no ratting happening, and very little mining. (I mean, if somebody pops a R64/R32 moon, that stuff is worth feeding some barges for.)
---
So on the whole, the local conflict is relatively unchanged, but people roaming for targets are mostly coming up empty.
---
Nothing is stopping you from talking in local to announce your presence. 
---
If you want an actual fight, why would you hide your presence? That just sounds like someone wants a gank instead.
---
Yes, judging by your response you clearly don’t. Did I not make it clear enough to your single digit intelligent quotient burdened skull that it’s a fair statement that they over represented. However, affixing your prejudice in game to their actions out of game at a csm summit is asinine. Do you really, really believe that they are working in some concerted effort to dupe ccp into handing the game to the imperium on a silver platter? Do you think they are that stupid?  I think a more diverse csm could be great. I think they are and have done a great job nonetheless.
---
I live in low sec, which is dead now.
---
They banned 22,000 accounts Jan-June, now add the 8 k in August and they have banned enough people to equal the entire logged in player base. Its pretty obvious bots are just being re-rolled.
---
His advice was to have your ganking alts at the ready. Their are thirty five entities on that first killmail. How many alts are you expected to have so you can mine high sec rocks again?
---
Right, so if they are 200k off and begin warp, there's nothing you can do.
---
You really are a moron, it's not an act
---
They should blackout your ability to post
---
I actually feel like the significance of ships is a reason FOR people to log in. Most of the reason that PVP is worthwhile and engaging in EVE is because of the significance of loss. Think about titans for example -- entire galaxy scaled battles occurred over a single titan being tackled in the past, and now they are merely another ship.
---
To all capitals? Imo no.
---
Dreads should be focused on killing other caps, and struggle with smaller targets. They shouldn't be able to apply anything to frigs. 
---
Carriers should be much more dangerous to small ships, requiring them to be jammed or fighters destroyed if they're on grid, since they can't come close to the DPS of a dread Vs another capital. 
---
It seems to me that many people want their nano ships to be untouchable by any class of capital at all, which makes no sense. Especially since there are subcaps (T3C's) that absolutely stomp anything from frigate to battlecruiser.
---
When I lived in a C4 c3/5 honestly I made a killing running the c3 sites dual boxing snakes.  You can clear a site in 5-6 min, a little longer for the data/relic.  
---
If I were going to go solo I'd probably grab one of those holes.  Need to go shopping?  Rage roll the C3 until you get one with a HS static.  Time to farm?  Find a C3 with plenty of sites (without a HS static). High class Krabbing? Roll to find a relatively empty C5 to run tinker/RR.  Want to pvp?  Roll the C3 for a null.  
---
Bonus points for no one really wanting C4s.
---
Before bot. You were krab if you didn't buy PLEX or make money by looting people. And before krab it was joo.
---
He's the fucking pide piper of a bunch of blind and stupid snakes.
---
congrats friend! this is very good news and i am happy for you.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
rip bots
---
o7 cant wait to run into you &lt;3 glad youre having fun again
---
I was not asking for your trust. I was just giving you a perspective on why the things are the way they are. I don't need you to trust me or anything.
---
Idk how stakeholders get a better outcome from changes that according to you caused massive amount of players leaving. If you or people like Mittens can bridge that logical gap with the Hilmar argument I am willing to consider it. So far the gap makes it just too nonsensical to me.
---
Why would I go to W Space? I'm not a krabber.
---
Well, if that were to be done, subcap ratting and mining folks would be satisfied I imagine. Who would be the big looser though? I was told cloaks are absolutely nessisary for wormholes. Who needs a cloak to function? Is it all cloaks need to go or just the covert ops?
---
EVE was already a borderline game when it came to payoff for amount of grinding. I was subbed for almost 7 unbroken years. Now it's just all tedious with less reward. I've been hanging on the last little while hoping they'd at least fix citadels and sov warfare. Instead we got drifters, multiple cap nerfs, and blackout.
---
Tell me more about myself so i can save money on therapy plz.
---
&gt;Industrial Cynosural Fields can be jumped to by Jump Freighters and Black Ops Battleships.
---
Why Black Ops BS? I get that you might want to bridge your Blockade Runner to them but by that logic you might want to bridge a Freighter, or an Orca to this cyno too. Adding the Rorqual to be able to use this cyno would also be nice for those of us that still have logistics rorquals.
---
I don't want to catch anything
---
That's an entirely different type of content and isn't what was being discussed. The sentiment was literally "come fight us, chase us out." The other comment was contrary to that, in which it described running as being chicken.
---
Oh, I'm in that thread :3
---
iirc they are pretty samey but nereus gets more hullbuffer and a drone bay
---
Same same.... I still have fun, no worries :)
---
Can’t get banned if I don’t log in. :)
---
That seems like the point.
---
An indicator in-system or on the scan window, that shows "full" or "empty." That way you don't know what is inside, just that something IS inside (or not).
---
A nullseccer trying to mine in lowsec so they have local is not attributable to the blackout?
---
the blackout isn't balanced one bit it favours the risk adverse pvp'er they get all the free intel both in and out of game.  cloaked ship that you can't scan down to pick the time thhey engange in pvp 
---
sure before it was in favour of the pve'er but it is no way balanced 
---
remove all in game and out of game intel inc killmails go to kill scorecards then add a way to find cloaked ship and it will be balanced
---
F for all Goons and Tapi members posting spreadsheets about post-blackout login numbers and fall in bounties.
---
Erm, no. Not even close.
---
But black out had no effect on low sec. so what do you mean it’s dead now?
---
Disinfect your keyboard m8.
---
When fewer people can almost make as much ISK as a ton more people, it IS easier. The ONLY difference is logistics now.
---
W Space krabbers aren't dying at rates that nullsec krabbers die, therefore, W Space is safer krabbing.
---
Based on similar wording elsewhere, I believe so.
---
Jebus.
---
This is nearly 1/3th of the total player count when i started in 2013. In 6 years time EVE lost nearly 40k of players. 
---
I really don’t see anypositive evolution here. 
---
This is just plain bad. Period.
---
Aged like fine wine.
---
Which resulted in people being willing to throw them around which resulted in many more dying then if people were scared of losing them. When you make the loss more significant you make people more hesitant to use them resulting in less ships dying.
---
Then when do wormholes get the nerf bat?
---
When Titans are less than 50b that is not inflation. Prices on EVERYTHING except PLEX and SP are at historical lows.
---
Dirty WH krabs.  
---
Just a matters of time till CCP sets the sights on them I expect...well... Hilmar is a WHer it seems so maybe not.
---
I think it's like there are tiers of cynos? Blops are the highest, normal are the lowest. Anything that can jump to a given cyno can jump to all lower-tiered cynos as well.
---
That was possible before black out too. If that was soooo viable they would've maxed out whatever server(s)/computer(s) they were running on when it was fucking lucrative to do so.
---
Except they'll need to make 400-600 accounts to make same level of isk botting in Hisec.  So, their cost of doing business went up 10x to support same level of isk, 1000% hit on margins makes the entire operation questionable. So atleast the more organised operations take a big hit.
---
&gt; Well, if that were to be done, subcap ratting and mining folks would be satisfied I imagine
---
doubt it since they would feed an endless amount of ships as soon as they want to go anywhere for any reason. 
---
&gt; I was told cloaks are absolutely nessisary for wormholes.
---
they´re convenient. 
---
&gt; Who needs a cloak to function?
---
people running lots of logistics. so mostly bears. 
---
&gt; Is it all cloaks need to go or just the covert ops?
---
none of them need to go but i wouldn´t mind it. it would kill the game faster than blackout ever could though because the vast majority of people who utilize cloaks actually want to avoid pvp. whaling groups would just adapt by utilizing high warpspeed/instawarp fits.
---
Highsec mining is probably too boring for the vast majority of people, but there are some. If you like mining, I won't stop you.
---
(Just be sure to buy your permit :P)
---
Thanks o7
---
Not at all.
---
They would have real incentive to adapt.
---
Always fucking spin is the Goons' motto.
---
Ikr, such a concept applies in so many different ways OvO
---
Well, that sounds about right, I must admit.
---
Its all 1 ecosystem where factors effect eachother. Null seccers roam into low and we fite them. They cant if they dont log in. 
---
Now low sec is starved and we dont log in. Now we dont consume the supplies we used to and logistics cant make isk and stop logging in... etc. 
---
We all rely on players in space that we can interact with.
---
Playerbase need to understand that fighting botting menace is an ongoing and continuous process. There is no magic wand that CCP waves around and bots are gone forever.
---
Props to CCP for what seems like taking the bull by the horn after years of negligence. 
---
O/
---
&gt; the blackout isn't balanced one bit
---
hence "part of a balanced nullsec".
---
Lol...no sarcasm on Reddit it seems.  Less on r/Eve. 
---
Lack of self deprecating humor is what will kill us more than any specific game change.
---
Sounds good to me!
---
An issue with this perspective is that you are still all-powerful with a capital only fleet. I can fully get behind carriers being the capital hull that deals with BS/BC hulls effectively, but I think below that you need to be looking at subcapital options.
---
Checkout our corp SEADC, we are established in Audaerne and most of our members are professional hi sec miners.
---
Www.silentcoalition.com
---
Literally already replaced.
---
I see you are incapable of watching the unprecedented increase in NPC kills in High Sec... gee I wonder where the botters went?
---
Titans are 50b because you can mine at unprecedented speed with near litmitless scalability, in overwhelming safety, dumbshit.
---
Ex-fucking-actly. EVE was super popular for RMTing and botting for a long time. Now, not so much. So they'll move to the second best thing whatever that is until that's been drained. We're talking about actual companies being behind this. Not some 12 year old who got a PC for christmas.
---
No we are obviously in the denial stage.
---
Yup, a number of changes happened that led us to the terrible meta that we find ourselves in now.  You won't find any disagreement from me.  Especially about the skill injectors.
---
But the parallels between the initial iteration of jump fatigue and the oncoming cyno change are too numerous to not point out.
---
A nearly identical distribution and set of reactions, similar intended ramifications/motivations (as addressed in CCP's 2014 blog post: nullsec stagnation, etc...) based on a very similar game state, and very similar criticisms (e.g., too heavy-handed, ramifications for logistics, implications for small gang people, etc...)
---
And given the change in the game from jump fatigue to now, I think that's all worth a mention and discussion.  Because even if it isn't 100% responsible for all the bad things, I do think the initial heavy-handed nature of jump fatigue, instead of its later more balanced iteration, helped cause the present dreadful game state.
---
They’re in hisec don’t kill them off like that :)
---
It makes the death of the non capital manual players get overlooked and that’s sad
---
Please continue to ignore the MASSIVE Highsec bounty increase
---
Except they doing it in hisec making that entirely wrong
---
/u/ikazuchisama I'm still waiting...
---
That's awesome! I just realised I've never flown a magnate...
---
It's another buff for armor fleets, since those use Nestors which not only have a bonus for hacking, but can also refit to something more useful after the successful hack...
---
&gt; EVE was already a borderline game when it came to payoff for amount of grinding
---
don´t do boring low effort/low payout PvE then? i mean anoms are one step above lvl4 missions in hisec. why would anyone with a brain or the need for isk ever do that shit if not for 2 reasons: being semi afk or botting.
---
then the log in numbers wouldn't have just dropped off a cliff when the changes happened.
---
I don't understand the "feed endless amount if they travel" part. Am I reading it wrong?
---
Should've implement it here on Reddit with mechanic of CCP team member councilimg you once you down vote Olmeca.
---
low sec is quieter then ever i get to sing in local with out worries
---
Is that good for you?
---
Well, when r/Eve screamed "Adapt or die!" the botters evidently listened.
---
No.  Trust me on this one.   I had to press F1 a lot in Vale.
---
And how is that the case? Maybe eve has to lose a lot of dead weight PvE’ers whose only contributions to the game are mining and industry, which is reflected in the mass drop of players.
---
As someone who has played eve for 8+ years focusing on pvp, Blackout has been one of the best changes ive ever seen imo.
---
So basically what this looks like is this blackout put a little dent in Test+Goons and smited the crap out of everyone else.
---
It looks pretty good. I thought that maybe it looked a bit like you used image trace on the magnate. I've tried doing it myself a couple of times because it takes so long to draw every line for the ship designs(there's a lot going on with them). It must have taken you ages though if you did it by hand!
---
They *can* reroll in minutes, but the report suggests they're not. ISK generated by suspected botters running nullsec anomalies fell off a cliff immediately after blackout, and that fall was not followed by any commensurate increase in any other form of ISK-generating activity by suspected bots. It may be that all the nullsec botters have decided to switch to highsec mining or some other activity that generates wealth but not raw ISK, but they are pretty clearly not just rerolling their banned anomaly-farming bots.
---
Imagine using the ugliest ship in Eve to advertise your game
---
That's a quote from the security report. Overall the amount of ISK is down by a great deal. 
---
I don't think you can contribute all of the high sec increase to bots. It's simply carebears returning to their natural habitat.
---
Yes but now bots have 10x less RoI with shifting to hisec.
---
Only if their main priority is to stay in null sec. They might have real incentive to move or to quit. 
---
Latest numbers show many have chosen to move to hisec and run missions. Is that good for the game?
---
Moon mining makes more money, and the npcs don’t come and mine all the rocks from underneath you, so that’s why everyone does it.
---
Unless you delete the character, it is immortal. There is a single class of ships where losing the ship results in loss of skill points on one of the related skills to using it. 
---
There are only two exceptions to this: 1) Tech 3 cruisers, when lost, also remove 1 lvl of support skill related to the ship. (at random from highest trained of the support skills for the ship)
---
2) When extracted to make injectors, the character which injects the skill points may get less than the amount extracted, based on his current Skill points. 
---
There used to be skill clones which would cause loss of SP if not "upgraded" after each death. This mechanic was removed years ago.
---
sorry new player here, who’s boat and why is he relevant?
---
@The cyno changes:
---
It is like the plethora of laws that prohibited smoking inside, in public areas, etc. 
---
Every smoker opposed them. Outrage!
---
Now, silence.
---
Overall ISK generation is down, which is a good thing. One step at a time my man.
---
LowSec has been dead for years. FW crabs and SuperDrops is all I've seems since 2015.
---
I recall some fan fest presentations, but not specific years. Noisygamer did a good job recapping prior to the presentations.
---
because eve isn't a fucking charity. it's a for profit business.
---
losing revenue from a declining subscriber base is the very opposite of a solution.
---
Basically CCP has just added in an element of natural selection. Be patient and a new breed of NullPlayer will evolve bathed in the blood and pain of the weak. The NullBro cometh.
---
I've been playing eve since 2008 and i would totally love to start from scratch on a fresh server.  
---
The idea of ppl being on the same level in terms of skill and isk and creating a new story is really appealing..   
---
Even knowing all the game mechanics wouldnt need be too much of an issue in relation to endgame as CCP could take steps (on the new server ) to limit capital proliferation and address the issues with null, citadels etc... from the word go.  
---
IMO thie biggest obstacle to "fixing" the game atm is that players have years invested in empire building with current game mechanics so changing them in any significant or meaningful way would mist likely kill the game anyway,   
---
So a theoretical (or actual) fresh start would be a great thing as far as im concerned.  
---
Not gonna happen tho.. not for a loong time, if ever.
---
Thus accomplishing CCPs long stated goal of bringing more life to hisec. 
---
Mission runner gankers rejoice!
---
oh hi there
---
When is your NDA up?
---
If i could get you forcefully removed from the eve servers i would and the world would be a better place for it
---
Since that’s what these fucking debates devolved into.  I feel that way as well about your cancerous opinions that are entirely selfish and short sighted with frightening levels of ignorance
---
What does that have to do with a huge drop of ISK generated by botters? There is no magic bullet that's going to get rid of every botter overnight. It's a war that needs to be constantly waged. This notion that what's being done didn't completely eradicate botting therefore it was a failure and should be reversed is a complete fallacy, one used to prop up arguments for the reversal of Blackout changes.
---
if he was CSM 11 according to the flair. we're on csm 14 i think now... the NDA is 5 years, so 2 more years?
---
looks like they don´t make any iskies tho. god bless.
---
The wormholers hate this being pointed out
---
Even whiny cunts pay money
---
Damn!
---
Indeed. I took "bleeding" as losing more than they generate
---
It’s more indirect, not everything is just bounties/hour
---
LP and other loot are a serious commodity for bots
---
If overall goes down, but the same level of botting cotinues, it means nothing in the long run.
---
Probably a couple years, Jesters just run out
---
If i move my isk making activities back to high sec, i have literally 0 reason to continue to participate in null sec pvp.
---
but it's too much hassle to move my shit back to high sec, when i have so many options to entertain myself that aren't eve.
---
at this point i'm just logging in to sort out PI and that's kinda it.
---
What if you could scan into plexes but ships in them couldn’t Dscan out
---
&gt;I asked if they have tried the isk doubling scam. It's worked well for Ken Moen for years.
---
How dare you! Ken Moen is a legitimate businessman and his generosity should be lauded!
---
Ken is a treasure to the eve community.
---
So what's the average isk / site? It can't be particularly high.
---
Just for reference CCP: When we say "Nova needs more MMO features" we mean "at some point a meaningfull integration/interaction with TQ, to give those battles a meaning in the universe we love"
---
That's worse than complete removal.
---
Damn near a trillion isk a month in bot and risk-free ratting wiped out. Cool!
---
&gt; Either way, teaching children to take advantage of other people in a way that harms them and benefits themselves is clearly immoral based on my previously stated definition.
---
And yet, this is practically the definition of good game strategy in a whole host of games that we don't consider people immoral for playing.
---
It would be immoral of me to walk into a room and blast everyone in it with a massive fireball, but nobody gives me shit when I have my D&amp;D character do it (except maybe the DM who wishes he never gave me that OP wand) my D&amp;D character is definitely not entirely moral.
---
its not really immoral to take on an immoral role in a game.
---
Having less bots and giving null space the risk it deserves is my stance. Because I call people out on being naive hypocrites is no fault but their own. I sleep fine at night, but I worry about people who get their panties in a bunch over other's opinions. Eve is far better now with the blackout than before.
---
You do realize that mining and industry is a valid, popular and pretty important part of Eve...right?  
---
I am not saying at all that the past system was not pretty broken, and actually needed to be balanced.  It did.  
---
That said, to imply that you can pretty well turn off that part of the game (look at the MER and NS PvE), that the people who actually enjoyed that gameplay are ‘dead weight’ and that having a significant number of people leaving the game is a net good thing for New Eden just strikes me as not the healthiest was to view things.  
---
Oh well...I still play the game I enjoy.  Time will tell just how resilient Eve to a good chunk of people disengaging from the game.
---
Ah the ancient myth of "the new player".. i have heard it before.. but never believed it. Also never seen it ingame in the last 6 years.
---
the intersection of people who actually benefit from using cloaks to evade PvP with people doing subcap anomaly ratting is pretty high. New players or bads. Many of them use cloaks for various reasons, mostly to travel and moving stuff around. I´m saying it would hurt this group more than it would hurt competent PvPers.
---
The graph does not show any increase in mission-running activity by suspected bots, though. Curious.
---
This might sound like a dumb question, but what the fuck is Nova?!
---
You could learn to play
---
Looks neat to me but hey I had fun playing Dust so that might just be a personality flaw.
---
You must have 0 experience in cap fights. 
---
1. The cyno changes make inhibs immensely more powerful not less powerful by requiring the target to now counter with a killable ship within 1min if trying to drop within 100km. If they are countering outside 100km with a cyno the inhib now provided 100km of safety for the hunting force. 
---
2. Inhibs are used in current  fleet fights constantly to deny unfavorable cap positioning or placement.
---
I will buy all your inhibs at 80% current Jita if you are so concerned.
---
When I used to SB machariel rat, I made about 500M/hr. Not afk, not bots, not bottom of the barrel. When I boson ratted, I made about 100M an hour, very not afk or bot. When I ran DED sites, I made anywhere from 200-500M/hr with jackpots if you got the A-type enams. None of those are bottom of the barrel, but all of those have been deleted. I used to rorq mine with 4 accounts in eso while i had my main off in detorid or somewhere hunting. I never have more than a billion isk in my wallet because I always krab just enough to pay for ships and plexing some of the accounts. I had 7 accounts omega for a couple of years. Now I have 3. In 2 weeks, I'll  have 0. If things change in the future, maybe I'll come back. Starting to highly doubt it though. I really wish I had just quit when citadels, skill injectors, and entosis sov started.
---
Dunno what stealth bomber fleets you go on, but I can guarantee you that there's been no lack of content under super umbrellas since the blackout began. Plus,  you're almost always guranteed a fight when you hit a rorq, since umbella Intel is not as great as it used to be.
---
"PROVE IT."
---
"I literally legally cannot. You know this and are still asking the impossible without me literally going into legal conflict."
---
Uh yeah, dude, you're being a fair bit of a bell-end. I don't like how nebulous it is either, but you cannot fault Olmeca in this regard.
---
Are you shorting CCP stock or something? Because, fuck me, that's some top tier FUD right there.
---
I mean you could just do what I do and search by pilots in active space. I've found slightly less Pvers but it's no way hard I don't need local.
---
Isn't that what they tried with Dust years ago? I remember something being planned about a synergy between Dust and planetary interaction in Eve. Heck, for a while both games shared chat channels. When I tried out Dust I could chat with people in my Eve corp and alliance - while they were playing Eve.
---
or just run missions in fw space for 1bil/hr
---
So, what's driving the huge export volume from Immensea?
---
The blackout is a success. And I'm sure in the end CCP will find a middle ground to make everyone happy. But until then adapt like the rest of us. We have less bots... what we all clearly wanted. We have more risk in null... what we all clearly wanted. 
---
The fact is, players who left just didn't feel safe enough. And that's great for the game. Because alliances will see that and work more to consolidate. It won't fix itself overnight. But it will. When you can solo with zero risk in null, the game is broken. If you had any brains you'd see that and see how CCP is trying to fix it. 
---
I'm pro-human players. That's my stance. Anyone that thinks they should be botting and afking in this game doesn't belong here. Eve grew and prided itself on time and effort. Injectors ruined that. Botting destroys that. It's a game in the end. Play it or logoff.
---
&gt;I am unsubscribing from EvE Online after Vegas
---
Oh no
---
The one thing Olmeca has never done is have spy alts but that’s coming from him. He made have really bad ideas but I don’t peg him as a liar.
---
It would have helped for me.
---
And the starting investment is also lower because t1 haulers for courier missions are dirt cheap and there no risk of someone ganking you on a gate in a t1 hauler moving mission crap in highsec, as opposed to possibly losing ratting ships while flying in null. It takes less time to train to a t1 hauler for couriers so their ramp up time is much shorter, and and unlike ratting anomalies there is no limit to the amount of missions being run at any one time from any one mission agent in any one system they can run as many bot accounts as their CPU/GPU can handle, allowing them to bot more in highsec then they did in nullsec, also there is no need to pay for space to rent because highsec doesn't have sov to worry about.
---
I think a trig titan would be a cool way to take care of structure spam.
---
I've got my moments ;-)
---
But seriously, I've put some thought into this. CCP are disrupting the operations of an entrenched player group, which is not going to happen without a reaction from the affected parties. So far that reaction has taken the form of protest unsubs and lots of "reeeee blackout" reddit threads. But personally I'd guess that at least half of the unsubs and unused mining/ratting alts will be active again once the meta stabilizes and they've figured out how to adapt.
---
10+ mill on t1 sites, i am going to post all abyss sites 1-5 and all weathers on my You tube!
---
And highsec rats killed and isk generated saw a sizeable uptick, so clearly they didn't leave they just moved to a different feeding ground.
---
If they would remove astrahaus farming drifters you would see it drop. Wspace is the only space I've seen the majority of people who live there say it needs more danger when krabbing. When ccp removed old capital escalations and thus tons of cap farmers left.
---
Now tons use mjd rattles cause its completely safe. Also of course fewer ratters die in wspace it also has less players.
---
They also create a "no carriers" zone. And yea, HAW dreads basically make them obsolete. For the price they just don't pack much power.
---
It was possible but not as high of an income level. Now that the chances of their bot dying in nullsec is higher the lower income in highsec is worth it because of the safety in highsec, also they no longer need to pay rent for space to bot in highsec, the activites they will bot require less training time and cheaper ships as well.
---
Because psyops, I've noticed a lot of dudes getting downvoted like crazy in minutes.
---
I think going from over 400 bil down to \~50 bil can hardly be considered nothing. The ISK being injected in to the economy is what is detrimental.
---
I'm confused, the fps they canceled almost a year ago is why you're quitting Eve?
---
I mean it takes two seconds for you to invade any wh from null friend. Come in with 400 bombers like the rage eviction. I don't know what you mean attack wormholes outside of that wormholers aren't hole controling to keep you out.
---
I interpreted that as a nice way of saying “I now believe it’s completely possible CCP is using smoke and mirrors to present statistics”
---
"Olmeca turned to our side, commence Order 66.."
---
Indiana squad! I will keep an eye out
---
Bc chat servers are expensive?
---
&gt; When I used to SB machariel rat, I made about 500M/hr
---
sure, not on one account tho. we are talking anoms here. 
---
&gt; When I boson ratted, I made about 100M per tick
---
that´s pretty much utter garbage considering the investment. 
---
&gt; When I ran DED sites, I made anywhere from 200-500M/hr with jackpots if you got the A-type enams
---
what keeps you from doing those and how have they been deleted?
---
Yes u agree they're dirt cheap, but it's still 10x more load on the hardware side of things.
---
You mean the dudes who run from x10 odds like you guys when you stand down?
---
just another player lost right, nothing of value lost, right? RIGHT?!?!!
---
I mean, people who wanted safety moved
---
Just for reference CCP hears: cat ears and p2w microtransactions
---
It the floating shares are devalued by, say, poor performance it could allow people to buy company stock at cheaper price. 
---
There are weird addendums in Icelandic acquisition law that require buyers to finalize complete purchases by paying out cash to the remaining share holders IF the share holder buys more than 5% during the grace period leading up to the completion of said buy out.
---
I may be interpreting that incorrectly but check it out yourself.
---
The graph specifically shows that ISK generated by suspected mission botting has not increased appreciably post-blackout despite the collapse in nullsec anomaly botting. That doesn't suggest that the bots have moved to a new feeding ground, it suggests that the botters have given up or not yet adapted and that the increase in highsec pve activity is due almost entirely to real players moving their ratting alts.
---
Don't be mad, we won't stop newbeans from joining fleets, you just get relatively more KMs. I've yet to see 30 pings even on CTA ops. 
---
Also depends on timezones and how packed the pre-planned fleet calendar is. 
---
I suggest you get a spy alt in Horde. This wayz you can always hop on the content wagon.
---
Don't be mad tho, do help newbeans stick around in Eve.
---
Yeah that is stupid for sure.
---
Thank you Horde, Brave, brave newbies, karma fleet for doing more to retain newbeans than CCP.
---
You mean like IRL battleships (or, well, used to be IRL)? That would be cool as hell, basically just constantly AoEing the fighters around them.
---
Yeah this sounds like a much better way of pushing the reward up for subcap PVE while still leaving a reasonable level of risk.
---
Can I just say, for the record, and for any other game devs out there:
---
**I FUCKING HATE AIM DOWN SIGHTS Stop that shit**
---
Am not even them my dude. I'm just giving an idea of their perspective. Lol
---
Go to lowsec.
---
Eve isnt a charity. Why should nullsec pve be as safe and secure as it once was? rorq panic and super umbrellas might as well be charity for dogshit players
---
what do you sing?
---
y tho
---
Made it to your 2nd sentence and concluded it wasn’t worth continuing. TL;DR sans the histrionics, thx
---
test moved his super fleet from immensea to detorid.
---
He’s just gonna keep repeating himself. That’s how gaslighting works.
---
Not really sure what your point is there. Wasn't saying there isn't any content, just pointing out that the actual isk printers - the super ratters - are still very much active, as they weren't really impacted by blackout. The crash in ratting isk income is from the fact that most subcap ratting had stopped.
---
Ded capital gameplay that takes years to train/ build - good job Game (not) Devs you menage to fuck this up big time. Now watch your most dedicated and deeply invested players drift away,  never to look back again. Why did you have to remove our cyno? To boost small wank gangs and wormholer billionaires. OK enjoy their cash, but not ours.
---
- I feel disturbance in the cyno, felt like thousands of capital pilots cried out on terror.
---
why the fuck would you hate that?
---
Eve is at its core, a PvP open world game.  Everything mined, researched, manufactured, and shipped will eventually at some point be blown up via pvp.  The people who left the game because their previously highly secure and cozy lifestyles were suddenly uprooted are, infact, dead weight. They refused to adapt, and see the reasons for why these changes have to be made.
---
I know plenty of ppl who multibox rorqs and mass produce captials that also love these changes due to the risk increase it brings and self-awareness in that rorq mining and capital proliferations are much bigger issue than some idiot miner who doesnt know how to fly a frigate losing his 'fun'.
---
(Sarcastic comment based on exaggerated straw man) (exclamation mark) (:tipsfedora:)
---
&gt; When I tried out Dust I could chat with people in my Eve corp and alliance - while they were playing Eve.
---
And just look at how far we've come. Now, depending on the day, we can't even chat with other eve players while playing eve.
---
DNG flair, checks out.
---
**PVE players get change:** Hey can we get reimburse:
---
PVP players chastise them for asking
---
**PVP players get change:** Hey can we get reimburse?
---
You lot are a sorry bunch
---
I’ve enjoyed watching Nullbears ruin their own gameplay for nearly a decade. It’s the gift that keeps on giving.
---
Np.
---
The Banning will continue until morale improves.
---
Well if you believe olmecca you may notice we have been opposed to most of the changes ccp makes that have caused these problems. So I am not sure where you are watching this happen but it isn't TQ.
---
HAW was such a brain fart. I don’t know how they thought that was a good idea considering the state of capitals for the past eight years.
---
Because they throw money at projects that fail instead of investing that into EVE?
---
I mean most people here define anyone opposed to these changes as crying and a bot, so I am using reddits measurement for them.
---
You can contract those corpses to Xuixien and I’ll give them ~~a proper burial~~ space in my frozen fun locker.
---
The spodbrain brigade is out in force today.
---
You do realize the gun is just constantly whipping up and covering part of the screen, which also tends to save on framerate and processing? 
---
It was only added for that purpose. Now all the kids love it for some reason, but I can't find any documentation that people run around with their weapon on their side and then bring it up directly in line with their center mass?
---
I mean maybe the people that dont like it arent the ones going on fleets... but general atmosphere on the forums and in fleets is positive.
---
&gt; Why should nullsec pve be as safe and secure as it once was?
---
because people spend a shit load of their time and resources to make it so? it's a direct result of their actions - why shouldn't they be rewarded for going and making shit happen?
---
&gt;So following your logic, why wouldn't they allow it?
---
they don't. go and look at the monthly security blogs.
---
In this case actual value gained :p
---
Cuz he’s bad at shooters
---
Though mostly just make PLEX more expensive for the rest of us.
---
They make more money per account that uses PLEX vs pays per month. Someone has to buy that PLEX, and the rate is $20/500 PLEX. The most expensive subscription (1 month at a time) is $15. So they make $5 extra for every PLEXed alt. If they were doing this to squeeze more money out of the game, they would encourage parallel alts to the greatest extent they could get away with.
---
Why do people ask for this. Stop. This is so stupid.
---
i dropped my first class ever cuz the instructor assigned an unreasonable amount of hw and wanted us to come in on days we weren’t scheduled for review, and marked no shows as absent. so now i have more time for eve but prolly owe someone money ◕‿◕✿
---
Lol!
---
i've been quite busy with work this week, but still had eve running and mined a metric fuckton of ore. i sure appreciate this option of low-maintenance gameplay
---
&gt;unprecedented
---
&gt;a few %
---
&gt;it’s all bots not real players
---
&gt;TL;DW
---
No shit, you linked a 47 minute video
---
"The Description of the Networked Sensor Array now clearly explain its Warp Scramble effect."
---
Huh?
---
Game is in a freefall, I hope CCP can fix it before it's too late.
---
Boson ratting isn't garbage. It's basically super isk with 100 times less clicking. Do it for an hour and you have enough 300M isk. In and out nice and fast and now you can go pvp and have a titan ready to drop on stuff or take on big fleets.
---
Blackout basically made subcap ratting disappear. With blackout and now upcoming cyno changes, there is going to be almost no one running the anomalies that escalate to DED sites. And again, you run DEDs with subcaps. I stopped running DEDs when CCP thought it was a good idea to have instalocking 200km scramming instablapping drifters spawn all over nullsec. Basically, the vast majority of things to do in null that were worth doing are no longer worth doing. Most people aren't going to stick around for shitty entosis wars if they can't even do all the things they at least somewhat enjoyed or tolerated doing before. As I said, EVE is a tedious game, both in PVP and in PVE. They went from having PVE be tedious to having it be just plain up not worth doing. And that's whey everyone is leaving or quitting.
---
How much would you pay for said corpses?
---
Stop coming up with ideas.
---
Wanted to add: make an overview tab to show structures and use Dscan to find people trying to “hide” their Athanors.
---
The tears are delicious too.
---
Here comes the blob! We're going to bring 3x, 4x, maybe even 5x as many pilots as you and then crow about it on Reddit!
---
People didn't go there, because in the beginning there was no good reward for the risk you put yourself in. There was no exploration. All you could do was ratting or mining (in belts, which meant you had to somehow deal with the NPCs as well). As you say the universe had just been born and thus nobody had skillpoints. Also there was no nullsec infrastructure so you had to live like a nomad and/or haul stuff all the time. All the while you were under constant threat of getting your shit blown up. It simply took a while until people became organized enough to make nullsec profitable.
---
Which caused deflation. The cause is not the issue here, it is your lack of understanding basic economics.
---
Why not? the long term meme is no one has sounds on but i remmeber at a fanfest a few years back they said that more than 60% of accounts do have sound on...
---
Sure, as long as you set up in Holy Amarr space.
---
I'd argue a bigger % of nullsec is bot revenue now.
---
were you not fucking around for casino war/world war bee? entirety of this subreddit was going off on the spinmaster and fueling their hatred of goons, arguably his job of driving content was a bit too good then and we bit off more than we could chew
---
HEY, YOU TAKE THAT BACK
---
Im still waiting on them to get their hitpoints put into shield and armor instead of fucking structure
---
That’s what frigates and destroyers should be for...
---
I was unclear in what I said and that's fair. But you clearly understand the point in making and are being a pedantic twat because you're upset CCP is trying to wrangle the problems they let fester.
---
Sorry for the necro but you spelled lower effort wrong
---
DUST514 was alright. Can we just have a port of that?
---
uedama is lowsec?
---
its called immersion dude
---
Ah, an entrepreneur! Make me an offer :)
---
I’m not talking about changes CCP made.
---
Nah, better not give them free intel.
---
Should, but they end up ineffective fodder. With this idea, you could make it a strategic module like siege. It would be pretty epic to have a flak wing in a fight.
---
So you have no examples?
---
Now this is content I can appreciate
---
Repeatedly.
---
Yessir. Just as everybody here that has at least a halfway functional brain was predicting
---
Is all bot. Eve onbot
---
Lol I went out yesterday to help raise adms in a myrm... fuck that worthless shit, I'm so glad I have an isk base to make money with
---
I believe you got flair baited again.
---
Because that is what the EVE Universe is about: Your action stick to the map and matter.  
---
Also notice that I said "at some point", meaning I do not expect them to have it implemented on release, I am perfectly fine with a solid shooter and that functionality added later, when the battles become dull because they don't change anything.
---
You don’t like ‘what ‘project nova will probably be’? I thought that looks really good.
---
Am I getting him and marshy mixed up?
---
Whoah buddy. Ease up a bit before you blow a gasket.
---
Rip bots. Pride to the real pve'er oh wait haha there is no more they quit or went to goons
---
If I’m going along with this: Make them last 2 weeks. Worse than incursions and can’t clear them.
---
Add 10 more bots and they make the exact same
---
Must be a slow drip
---
&gt; Boson ratting isn't garbage. It's basically super isk with 100 times less clicking
---
why would i do that if i need to put in countless hours to get a return of investment? i´d rather do 100 times more clicking and spend the 60 or whatever bil towards shit im actually interested in. especially since you can easily make 300 mil/hr in more engaging ways that need a fraction of the investment. sure if your endgoal is crabbing, growing a thick wallet and running garbage content until the servers shut down this might be feasible. otherwise it´s just flushing a titans worth of isk down the shitter. 
---
&gt; And again, you run DEDs with subcaps
---
sure, refits and mobile depots are a thing tho no? 
---
&gt; Basically, the vast majority of things to do in null that were worth doing are no longer worth doing.
---
compared to other kinds of space i actually agree. noone forces you to sit under a nullbloc umbrella tho amirite? yeah, if they want to keep this up they need to raise nullsec payout significantly.
---
They could just make a good game for once instead of once again failing at making some eve connected spinoff where everything is sacrificed to make it connected to eve.
---
Thank you, Captain Obvious.   
---
Yet it should be noticed that there are individuals who don't mind investing time in education.
---
I'm gonna head over to the pitchfork emporium. Let me know if you need anything.
---
im a real pve`er

Oh please. Get a life.

GSM strikes again, goons to deploy Sin home defence fleet rabble rabble rabble.
---
They went Kaaput e nen of them survived.
---
Really makes you think why he isn’t mining under fortress dronelands.
---
You basically made the argument that they don't create new bots. While it may may not be the best argument in all cases, I felt that in this case reductio ad absurdum is a good argument.
---
wait are you talking about bean-shidh or inhe
---
That is literally what I said: Make good game, add EVE later
---
&gt; can you boosh drones in HS without going flashy?
---
Cannot activate in highsec *at all* afaik
---
Hmmmmm
---
That’s not the argument I made...
---
1. nope, because cyno can be fit only on recon and that kind of ship has so low EHP. defender can evaporate it fast and as well defender needs his own, so there is not anymore needs to have inhib, killing recon is so easy.  
---
2. nope, there are no regular cap fight where it is needed, it is needed just for goku/stuka fleets or most of cases surprise rorqs/supercaps to deny them faxes jump on them  
---
3. just look at zkill and looks for inhibs, there were 0 use for them when2016 rorqs changes use of them slowly increase as defenders supercap umbrella increase, now without cynos on caps you just do not need it as well as do not need many mobile structures....
---
Pretty unplayable for me. For different reasons. Just got accepted into the alpha. But on an unsupported device. We are pretty far into homogenised platforms now. What are the reasons to support specific devices rather the platform levels? And who are the Hong King people developing this?
---
This is an excellent post. You're a handsome man.
---
I'm sorry, was there something factually incorrect in what I said?
---
That's not because of the blue checkmark, that's because I play EVE.
---
Jump Fatigue and Cyno changes are not even in the same book, let alone the same page, in terms of game changing. Jump Fatigue, especially the first version, broke the game into very specific regions. It also led to nearly unbreakable fortress gameplay due to the LY range of said capitals. 
---
Current Cyno changes means you have to train a dedicated alt or a main with the skills. That is it.
---
Fair
---
&gt; I saw CCP Rattati's comment
---
wat? link pls
---
https://zkillboard.com/system/31001793/
---
I love lindybeige videos
---
If you already want a titan, then titan ratting is great. 
---
I think I'm one of the few people that still carries around a yurt in my DED lokis since most people refit in the eleventy billion citadels spammed all over New Eden. But mobile depots won't save you from drifters and there are still going to be way less escalations. If you want to farm 6/10s, it's already terrible isk getting the escalations, now it's worse since you'll lose many more subcaps doing it. Smartbombing machariel used to be the best way to farm 6/10s and that account got about 12M isk ticks. None of the risk/reward ratios make sense any more.
---
Another thing that I haven't seen anyone talk about with blackout is that I used to know the people that were in my system. Not only did it help develop a sense of community, it also helped to catch blue spais. I caught several during my days of smartbombing. Blues or light blues acting suspicious or being in places they had no reason to be for a long time was noticeable. Now hunters basically have free reign with blue eyes because no one will ever notice they were even in system.
---
That was great to watch and useful information.
---
I have not tried Triglavian content but it seems quite the straightforward enterprise. I’m going to look into that.
---
Great video! More please!
---
I'd place money that I did
---
in 7 years of eve i didn't have as much fun as over the past month with the thera bros. really enjoying the game now (✿◠‿◠)
---
Can the retribution handle any tougher sites?
---
Are you seriously this dumb? Do you think the money made from these accounts just sits there, happily waiting to be taken out? This ISK spends no timer longer in-game then needed. Assuming they learned by now, they have a script that when a wallet does hit x amount, it gets run through 100 accounts to obscure it and then again the next day. There is only so much backtracking a team will do. It aint exactly hard to create 100 accounts a day with a script.
---
To the 1.0 carebears it is.
---
FUCK YOU AND YOUR GAY ANIME THREAD. GROW UP OR BETTER YET FUCK OFF AND PLAY WOW
---
There's a significant delay for that. if a fleet is roaming, they'll be 20 jumps away by the time it reflects that on the map.
---
How many people in a big bloc fight are realistically pumping so much adrenaline they can't even hit f1 on a target.
---
And I'm there, still waiting for that PC reboot of Dust....
---
He's a gun for Aiur. Ha get it?
---
RIP using bumping to hold someone down indefinitely with no opportunity to counter the aggression, yes. And good riddance tbh.
---
Ahhh, ok - thx
---
If you look at the data by region, there's one clear outlier... and really, there's no way to fix that without screwing over everyone.
---
In this case really nothing of value
---
Lol. That's some pop corn.
---
Remove haw? Sure. Never really agreed with them.
---
Nerf EHP, Disagree. T1 capitals have low ehp anyway amd die quickly under consentrated fire. Supercapitals should take awhile to die, they are super afterall, and take a massive amount of resources to build.
---
Nerf Cap Application. Yes and No. Carriers should not be able to wreck frigates, but should be able to defend itself from cruisers and up.
---
Buff Subcaps, disagree. At what point do subcaps become the new capitals. Anti-Capital ships already exist.
---
You sure, I could have sworn Dr Strange said we were in the Endgame. I distinctly remember that.
---
Adding eve make game bad
---
Hey, the permit thing is my line...
---
We didn't ask to get more risks in nullsec. We ask for a new sovereignty system who make conflicts more fluid. Entosis is a failure, citadel proliferation could have been avoided if only CCP had a brain. It is not like there weren't any "station proliferation" before, 1 in nearly EACH nullsec system... And why should we have to wait 7 days or get this damn damage limitation ? POSes were less annoying on this last point, they got full damage...
---
CCP seems act like we are still children unable to maximize the potential of any gameplay mechanics they release. When they made capitals easier to access, obviously alliances/coalitions saw the possibilities of that and acted accordingly. Capital proliferation and supercap umbrella are a CCP INVENTION.
---
The main problem of the game is here : As long that CCP and many fanboys refuse to admit that CCP are FULLY responsible for the situation, it will be impossible to do anything correctly. Alliances/coalition only played with THEIR mechanics, we did with what they gave to us.
---
And sorry but we have already to work to consolidate the space. The ADMs to maintain, the fuel required for the ansiblex and everything else, etc. You don't know nothing about the nullsec civilization process. If there are less people to keep maintaining, coalitions will manage to survive because of their numbers and by making few highly secured pockets to contentate the risk-adverse people. Take my word, YOU will have less targets to kill at the end.
---
But I will fully agree with you on this point, is that this damn injectors is a bad move, if they are not killed the game the day they were released. Whatever CCP will do to "correct" nullsec, it will be compensated in a way and another by creating more characters using injectors. They MUST be removed.
---
Only after that CCP admit his responsability and remove the injectors, we will be able to speak about really correcting the game. Making capitals longer to access, more expensive (citadels too), etc.
---
But as it will never happen, the game will die, helped by incorrect modifications. We got today the worst login number in the last years. I begin to wonder the EVE will survive 2020.
---
I'm wanting to try some wormhole life, been getting back into eve after having played only shortly \~10 years ago. I mostly play solo, probably because I play sporadically, sometimes I'm on every day, sometimes i'll be away for a month.
---
6.5MM skill points, basic scanning skills, just finished covert ops, in a battlecruiser now, t2 armor tank, t1 weapons &amp; drones, \~1/2 a bil in ISKs, no significant rep with anyone. Logged on for the first time in years a while ago and that's what I found, been playing the L1 Sisters of Eve epic arc to relearn things. 
---
Any advice on getting into wormhole life as a low SP solo player? Any guide's you'd recommend?
---
I've been searching around a bit, learned the basics of scanning, found &amp; hopped through a wormhole from high sec, got run off a relic site by NPCs &amp; made it back safe. It was a blast, but I didn't really accomplish anything, not sure what direction to go in next. Is wormhole life feasible for a solo noob like me?
---
link killmail
---
Megathron &gt; Supercapital
---
old rats don't have a targeting range.
---
I just checked. Aligning to some object and then orbiting it doesn't cause the plane of the orbit to contain the velocity vector of the ship. Choosing a course that would lie tangent to the desired orbit also gives some random inclination.
---
Amen. I just wish people would play the game as a GAME.  Fight us, chase us, stop being afraid to lose a ship. It's a game, and pvp in EVE is the best pvp in my opinion.
---
maglor was asking the important questions, also remember........
---
V0lta is trash!
---
i've only been at ccp for three weeks but it's a super nice place to work with lots of friendly, helpful nerds who have made me feel at home. iceland is lovely this time of year and i'm really looking forward settling in to the job and doing good things for the community.
---
Wormholes already have blackout.
---
Pretty much, yeah, but that's not the same sentiment as saying that "in the good old days" there was no one in null, let alone the fact that those days weren't all that great either from my recollection.
---
the only submission of yours was on r/motivationalpics fren. hope all is well
---
imagine pumping so much adrenaline you can't push f1 on a target because you might lose your 50m ferox
---
Yup.  
---
One year later, almost day per day CCP sold out to Pearl Abyss, and today we have this shit.
---
A mobile game with no link what so ever to the game itself and with the mark or EA chinese Satan stamped proudly on it.  
---
Can't say I didn't saw that one coming, but it still hurts.
---
I tried finding that from their post history but came up empty, do you still have it or a link?
---
activating the concord enforcement cascade can delay its response in other areas, failing that who knows
---
The last NSA patch made it a hic point essentially so I guess they added wording to adjust it.
---
Being able to change opinions based on new information is worthy of respect, and an upvote, reddit shitposting aside.
---
The data is indeed no longer sent to the client, so it is safe also if someone decides to break the EULA.

Thank you for saying what I couldn't think of how to express.

I thought t2 frigs where good against fighters when an fit?

No, I am saying that if you use the ESI access they logged in in order to reveal their data publicly you 
---
1. are doxing people if those data are personal and from IRL, or if they can lead to such a type of data - which can get you banned.
---
2. are giving out internal corporation data to other people.
---
It's just a warning : DONT SO THAT.
---
Don't ask people to give an access to their account publicly. The choice to give personal data should always be theirs. Don't assume they will do that "to help you" because you are actually hurting them in the future and thus the corporation.
---
If your solution requires people will give their data to an external site, or log in a site that you don't control, then your solution is bad (worse than no solution).
---
The only possible solution is that you use a CORPORATION LEVEL site that will handle the accounts and the data you wanna see, and make it available to you only.
---
do they have tridents?
---
It's Xenuria so no, not really. Not even joking.
---
Yeah right. They fixed it so greatly than now, missions give more ISK in the game than null-sec.
---
Anyone with a brain would see a problem here.

Another useless parasite threatens to unsub. Headline news.

Per unique corpose usually go for 1M.
---
But if it is a corpose of a streamer or someone famous it can go up eazly
---
Ah, an admirer of the kickstand!
---
Thank you for you perspective. It gives me alot to consider.

Dude, cat ears *are* the winning microtransaction.
---
Then 40% don't.

I may of kept playing if there were cat ears

I bet it’s Ikitursa&gt;Loki’s because they didn’t have someone to strip the fits from all the structures again.
---
unless if you're PL then for every ship you undock they run away if they have even the smallest chance of losing the fight.
---
&gt;Data and Relic analyzer modules can no longer auto-repeat, since auto-repeating is almost always an incorrect choice for these modules.
---
**PRAISE BOB**
---
It'd be nice if having isk meant something again
---
You know a pimp scram goes further and has less strength right? This wouldn't affect anyone but core stabbed ships and supers. Also he even mentioned that neuting bs should be taken into consideration. 
---
All you're reading is one sentence and spouting diarrhea.
---
Found his buggaboo XD
---
I don't think you understand how boosters work. They boost and use the cap at the same time. You're not negating a booster you're just forcing them to consume the cap on inject.
---
I just don’t understand why capitals should be the solution to all engagements. There is no subcapital in the game which is a reasonable response to ALL other subcapital compositions, capitals should be no exception. Every class has their niche, none should be able to fight all others.
---
I’ve been to ronUSMC’s stream and lost half the amount of brain cells I had before
---
Now I’m stuck with 1 brain cell, thanks
---
You just named the two most autistic battleships to fly and called the fun ones autistic. Stay in your orthrus buddy
---
Ccp finally showing their “null is too safe with umbrella of capitals” really meant
---
“fuck goons are good let’s get on their side and kill everyone else before they can”

imagine thinking chori rmts or uses a loot script... thats totally false and baseless accusations.. stay trash, long live volta!
---
No, that's not all that it means.
---
This change has implications for people doing logistics (who now need to utilize more expensive and more importantly, larger, cyno ships), people tackling supers (particularly in lowsec where the extra weak link in the chain is going to make killing supers more challenging), people doing capital fights (where hard cynos are a part of the meta), people who use bait ships with cynos, etc...
---
In fact, the main place where this change doesn't matter all that much is with rorq krabs, who will almost certainly adapt by having a cloaked recon cyno alt on grid at all times ready to bring in reinforcements.  And with the potential newfound defender's advantage, they might actually be even safer.
---
Do you still play?
---
Sure it becomes more common, but making it commonplace comes at an expense. People at one point used to alarm clock for titan kills, spam ping their alliances, post on reddit, etc. These tangentially related parts of killing supers in eve were part of what made people so excited to log in and fight, and part of what made people who used them so excited to commit them in dangerous circumstances. When ships are cheap, sure they’re easy to lose — but they are also much less interesting to kill.
---
1/3rd of the most persistent active base gets knocked out yet TAPI and Goons keep saying that instead it's mostly the humans.
---
You guys want battleships to be good vs caps? Give them jump drives kek
---
Whew lad, somebody's taking their small penis issues out on Reddit today. Yikes! 
---
Feel more like a man now? Here, have a Snickers.

Alek,

I joined Noir. Academy around 2010-11 and phased into Noir. proper way before I had any business being there.  I appreciate the opportunity to fly "with the big boys" and the months of training (took the class twice) in pvp.  These were really formative months for me as an Eve pilot, and I still proudly remember specific incidents that I retell in fleet comms.  Flying with you was like flying with a rockstar, no lie.  
---
Thank you for teaching me some basic PVP shit and the lesson of "never do something you're good at for free!"
---
Shot outs to 'Roo
---
There is risk.
---
You just can't stand that "risk" involves effort that defenders are willing to put more into than you.  I worry about you as I go to sleep myself.  The fact that you think a game is better off without people playing that don't play your way and then claim that you " worry about people who get their panties in a bunch over other's opinions."
---
You're a liar, at worst.  A troll at best.  And something sad and inbetween most likely.
---
&gt; but to millions that play
---
Nobody tell that guy, the shock may kill him.
---
If I wanted to hear more if his bad opinions I'd watch his stream, but thanks for the update.

When a ganker ganks at say an asteroid belt, Concord will remain on grid at the belt for an extended period of time.
---
By undocking with the criminal flag the system's Concord will move to the station to kill the flagged noob ships.
---
This means that when the criminal countdown is over, there are no Concord remaining on the belt.
---
&gt;Any advice on getting into wormhole life as a low SP solo player? Any guide's you'd recommend?
---
Join a low-class wormhole corp. Then move up to a high-class one. You need lots of alts to do it fully solo (at minimum, a scanning alt to get you back home). Scan down the chain for them while doing solo stuff and make sure that it's in the mapper. If you find something interesting while doing solo stuff and can't handle it on your own, call them and stick around as a warp-in. The corp will probably give you a favorable share of the loot.
---
Low-class anomalies might just need a Drake or Gila. Higher-class ones might require multiboxed Nestors, for example.
---
How dare you! We all know that the ugliest ship is Caldari  Bantam.
---
Put 10 Ted vs 1 super carrier. 10 Ted may not be able to kill it but it can defang it and the carrier cant do anything about it. How is that fair? Stop being retarded
---
&gt;flying industrials through lowsec with the correct fitting and enough skill to not get ganked by the first gatecamp you run into
---
I once took a Sigil through with **no** fitting and survived the gatecamp. Was the gatecamp just incompetent?
