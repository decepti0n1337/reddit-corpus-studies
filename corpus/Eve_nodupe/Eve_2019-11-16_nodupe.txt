1. Any good corp does this.
---
2. All depends on the players and what is about at the time. If it is a good corp then they will always have a stock pile that they won't need to ever worry about unless there is a MASSIVE push going on for systems with 24/7 plex battles.
---
3. Never. Or to put it another way, how many fitted T1 Frigs and Dessies can you buy with 1b ISK? 1 player in the good corps (and I mean regular player not a Director or CEO) can happy throw 1b ISK in the corp wallet to buy new ships and never think about it again. The main issue is moving those ships, but with Gal/Cal FW space so close to Jita even that is not an issue. And then again with the new moon mining they can easily get the minerals they need to build the ships in their lowsec home systems. When I used to do FW in S0TF we would happily hand out ships to people in fleet who were not even in the corp or alliance, including Fitted T2 Logi or Faction BS.
---

---
The main point is that the corps want their members in space, in fleet, in a ship. Even if that ship is a T1 frig with only MWD and tackle or ewar, they can be very useful in FW plex fighting.   
---
Good luck 07

You gotta change the location of your image on the screen so that you’re not blocking the overview and your targets, or you have to move the place where your targets show up in your UI.

Spend a bit of time organizing how you want both your Eve UI and your streaming overlay to work out.

Yes, of course I would choose my money back.

Any Intel on why was it closed?

No. EVE hasn’t been that expensive and it has given me things that I would never have thought possible.
---
Because of EVE Online I have hugged a Playboy Playmate. I’ve gotten to know some really awesome people, had outrageous fun, I’ve gotten to know Iceland, I traveled a bit of the rest of the world, I can follow nerd conversations that scare the people \[Schiphol airport, I love you!\], my name is on a fucking statue. I’ve been addressed \[along with everybody else in the room obviously\] by the president of Iceland. I’ve seen a set by Saucy Miso \[some of the best electronic music I’ve ever heard\]. I am at home in one of the nicest, cosiest art house cinemas I’ve ever seen.

What a great time to be playing EvE OP, the majority of EvE devs that had profound positive impact on the game have been fired or left, the community team is but a skeleton, CCP has been sold to a Korean company and is now basically in maintenance mode chasing those daily login numbers by providing endless mindless daily login rewards, just like World of Tanks...
---
Well at least someone loves me.
---
Wait but Scott Manley says fly safe... *confused screaming*
---
What’s the difference between a free account and a subscription account
---
New accounts dont have it :(
---
Just saying it for those who used to, so they understand why.
---
There is an immense dev focus on safety these days, the majority of latest changes made living in space safer and safer with every patch...
---
So you didn’t get the reference?
---
Mittens is a fucking bellend, and that stupid meta show, jesus tits on a bike.   Pitts was an awesome content creator, better off not in Goons.
---
Enjoy your space pixels
---
You can barely fly anything reasonable with a free account and the stuff you can fly does about 50-60% of the damage and has about 60% of the HP and speed that a paid account has...
---
I'm not sure what the algorithm is for it, but none of my three accounts have the event flag and I still get SP from killing rats everyday.
---
Even on my 1 day old alt account I got sp from rat killing.
---
Happily. I had a good time during the 6 years I played, but by now my interests have moved on and frankly, so has the game.
---
What reference? I know Scott Manleys videos, that's all.
---
They'll let *anybody* in.
---
They'll tax the shit out of you.
---
They'll say they're helping you out while you only *really* exist to bolster their numbers.
---
And they have a huge superiority complex.
---
Yep! Pandemic Horde sounds perfect for you.
---
That's a nice picture
---
Most of the imperium loves you Pitts. Just last week we blew up capitals together. I don’t know the full story but I feel they made a mistake. Maybe in time the mistake will be realised and the decision reversed. I don’t think they realise just how many people in the Imperium share a long fond history with you. We started killing Panfam since the Casino war together. It’s heartbreaking. Yeah there’s this long standing relationship with the Russians and I’m sure we don’t ever want to end that, but they could of taken the keys off you for a while like they did Boat during the fountain war. This feels excessive. Shadow State in particular have been deep in the vanguard of our wars.
---
If you have a shiny pod that might be a pretty big risk to take if it's worth more than the gila
---
For this one yes.  It's a fort [in the heart of TEST space](https://i.imgur.com/GJVAsUS.jpg).  Now the structure was allowed to exist on the agreement that it wouldn't be used to stage caps out of.  Anything else would be fine you want to do blops go ahead, subcap fleets?  Not a problem, just no caps.
---
Welp he loaded it up with a couple hundred bil of caps and dropped on TEST so yeah needless to say they were a bit mad about that (who the fuck am I trying to kid its TEST the reeeee was heard halfway to cobalt edge).
---
That's just the individual situation going on here.
---
I would love to be able to extract and re-inject my own skills without diminishing returns
---
Log in as alpha, take note of all those yellow omega only skills. Buy a few alpha injectors or skill spree to get to a number divisible by 500k.  Extract  omega only skills, and then sell extractor on marker to plex account. Set up an alt slot with plus 5s and keep it training / extracting to pay for your account. You will lose 200m or so a month, but fairly easy to still play for free with little time investment, even if you stay alpha, there is a lot of fun to be had get out of the bigger is better mindset. Some of the most fun I have had is in a small 20m isk ship
---
Just wait a couple weeks, you will see some interesting updates via dotland about delve. Newsflash FC's arent the only ones leaving goons
---
That’s a lotta new blood
---
That's amazing
---
You don't even bother to provide any justification or logic as to 'why', though. All you say is "the undock button is not a consent to PvP button" without any reasoning or context.
---
Which is just made even more of a joke by the fact that EVE, by design, was created to be a cold, dark, harsh world where a player could do just about anything.
---
But yeah, if your post had any effort put into it other than just a smug opinion thrown out without a single thought, people might do more than just laugh.
---
spent thousands as well, but if i lost my memories then no. had too many great times, and would forget the people that i still talk to even now
---
Fuck. Yes.
---
I've had some few posts back and forth in the past with Vile Rat on the SA Debate and Discussion forum, the only place I really "knew him". The world lost a great intellect on that sad day.
---
Well, I love exploration, and now I’m with a group I can find targets for while doing my thing, and I can reship and join the hunt, and when enough of us are on we can farm sleepers for ISK.
---
So I got all my bases covered for myself, you gotta find some thing that’s a balance for yourself.
---
Join a newbro friendly corp, they should help you out in that regard, or FW, lots of pew, I hear some of them give out T1 fit ships and SRP.

2016 was a phenomenal year. One of the most fun years I spent in Eve.

Re: Keepstar DD  
---
The issue here is that the keepstar DD was a server side script that would run regardless of what the target did, so long as the script was started in the correct conditions.  
---
You can listen to Suitonia, former csm, say (paraphrasing):  
---
&gt; 10 of us could sit on a fortizar, within weapons range, and the weapons are useless because we can just warp off **(they are out of Upwell Point range due to anchor mechanics)**  
---
The issue at heart is thus, they cannot warp away from the doomsday, which takes 14 seconds before it does damage.  
---
Now the DD bug/exploit has been fixed by adding conditions to the script, and it stops immediately when the keepstar looses target lock on the ship.  This effectively removes the need or want for moving all FLEX structures, from the most vocal advocate for it...
---
Moving FLEX structures has multi order effects, fixing a bug that was harming niche gameplay does not.  
---
Further fallacies and miss-understandings in the video include:  
---
* KS DD is 4m Damage  
---
* T1 Sirens can be scrammed outside of their point range by all ships in the game, shutting off their 60s cd mwd  
---
* A max skilled, 3x Faction Drone Nav Nyx with 2x T2 Sirens can be fully countered by a Faction Fit Scram Keres without taking any ewar effect  
---
* The problem with Supers is ehp, pretty much every ship in the game can point and web (sorry amarr)  
---
* Citadel weapons are useless in their current state for a multitude of reasons, including bomb agility, eve intercept AI, time-to-kill, time-to-target, and combat ranges in general.

I like using T1 ships because they're fairly engagable by most. T2 ships scare people for some reason, but ships like the Incursus, Tormentor, and even web rail Atrons get some fair numbers of fights.

You can always hop into NPC Null.

Sansha, Blood Raiders, Mordu's Legion, etc. You can use NPC stations and avoid liability of anchoring your own structures.

Confessors are so pretty
---
Would you enlighten me on how army of bots supports the game????
---
They devalue work players do.  If an army of bots is mining then they depress ore prices.   Same for ratters.  Plex should cost a lot less for iak but bots raise the prices on people just playing the game.
---
Absolutely
---
it's not, all 5 is all that matters, knowledge won't save you from 2500 dps leshak
---
It's not as bad as you think. Battleships on wormholes with multiple logi alts is definitely an end game type deal, but there is plenty of fun in-betweens. 
---
For example, training into a good solid battlecruisers can net you a lot of fun fights. A hull tanked brutiz with an ancillary armor rep is fun, u ironically, a rapid light missile Drake is fun as well as a heavy assault missile version, and the drekavac is amazing. 
---
Find a PvP style that you like, find a ship that goes with that style, and have fun. You can definitely have fun in aeta version until you can use t2. 
---
Pilot skill is a lot more important than having perfect skills. A mediocre trained pilot with good flying skill that knows the ship and what it can engage is more dangerous than a perfectly trained Loki pilot that doesn't know how to fly a Loki.

Also were the rats(I assume they were sleeper rats) on your overview?
---
Could help if you posted your loss mail.

CCP will probably reimburse you cuz your new/young. The general rule of thumb I've heard around is you get one or two stupid non-pvp losses that they will just replace to keep you happy before they will just tell you to get good lol
---
Not playing anyway and the game will be completely dead within 5 years so not quite
---
I enjoyed listening to this. Thanks!
---
Honestly, no.  I'm rather underemployed at the moment, and could certainly use the money.  However, EVE is the only game I've ever stuck with for any length of time.  No other game has caught my interest like EVE has, and it has it's own value for me as a nice little distraction for me - especially because of my situation.
---
as you noticed by yourself and ppl mentioned there are 3 possibilities: either NPC null with a always avaible NPC station as staging system, or being a nomad and wandering in SOV null, or bent the knee and settle down having access to multiple citadels. Last one means to become renter in a renter alliance of big powerblocks which always comes with lowest possible participation in PVP required, cause they might not have aliance LVL standing fleet, however you pay a little bit more for SOV system than you would to Concord because you also pay for piece of bluestandings...however you get access to local market if avaible + intel channels which are in some way of safety for farming, moveops or logistics.
---
about PVP: your probably most easiest way to learn is FW, however becoming renter you learn how to F1-monkey and squad -  PVP - cancer - approaches, like ravens/rokhs with MJD and booshers and similar long range kitting fights. At this point you need to learn from FC's directly to become in some way FC, so mikro-gangs and roams are your daylies.
---
About NIPs and NAPs: on alliance lvl there is always a NAP(with some exclusions f.e. friendly fire on and public fleets), on coalition LVLs there is in half of the  cases a NIP especially to neighbouring territory (best example the Imperium and Legacy coalition there is a NIP between both, however no 1 gives a shit when they roam in each other territory, additional there is also aggreement which best to describe as "frenemies" or "bluetrals" ), in the other half of the cases there is no agreements = so beyond the region / constellation is the "ENEMY". Also between alliances in the same coalition there is in most of the cases a NAP, however between alliances living on the opposite boards of the same coalition there might be a simple NIP instead of NAP. 
---
But back to the topic: if you move in NPC null or choose a nomadic life style you need to learn PVP or you just don't cut it in the long run (except in exploration, which is a nomadic life style itself)
---
Navy Hookbill in FW.  
---
Jackdaw for PVP.  
---
Guardian for turbokrabbing.
---
I should also note that simply warping on-grid once every 30s will stop a keepstar from using doomsday any destroyer or frigate as the keepstar takes forever to lock their sig radius.
---
But what do I know, I am just a simple shitposter.
---
just getting back into the game and pretty stoked about it.
---
corp hunting is interesting, still trying to figure out exactly what i wanna do this time. was in horde before, think i might look for a smaller group to play with.
---
i'm training towards caps at the moment. phoenix on my main and rorquals on 2 of my other characters. still a ways off though. still stoked to be within spitting distance of them though. (✿◠‿◠)

hope everyone has a great weekend.

Go to /r/WallStreetBets and put it on the flavor of the hour

---
already unsubbed and client deleted. i dont care if they pay my money back, but this game is alreadt ruinned
---
I've been doing this recently myself. I setup two alts in lowsec who do the production and bought bpcs. First thing I did was to make sure I had enough working capital. No good having bpos if you can't keep them working, so make sure that after buying the bpos, you've still got isk to keep production going.
---
My main is in a large nullsec alliance, so I've bought some new bpos and been researching there, with great reductions in time. Now I'm churning out copies and plan to build from copies, since I can create copies quicker than my alts could build from bpo.
---
Tldr, I bought new BPO, since I could afford to wait to research, and also guarantees that when it comes to reselling, you aren't out of pocket.
---
Join a corp, get people to teach you things, and don't be afraid to ask. You can make a lot of friends this way, which, in my opinion, is one of the main focus of this game.
---
This is true. There are still people alive, but they too, eventually will die.

If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. Consume you it will!

It's very much worth joining a corp even if you do play a few times a week. You'll have a regular set of faces you'll be seeing and you'll be able to have people to rely on for certain things like good deals or insight or tips and tricks or fitting advice.
---
Implying he ever had one to become an ex.
---

---
A relatively small independent corp can take space that is not highly strategically valued by the big alliances and mega coalitions.
---
You just have to have a good strategy, the acceptance that at times you will lose your space, but also have the determination to not go to HS and cry, but continue fighting for it. Youll probably be able to take it back. You wont be fighting by forming a fleet and trading blows while their rep wing easily saves their ships and you get volleyed, but by acting as more of an insurgency force. Essentially use tactis where it doesn't really come to fleet brawls, but small skirmishes where you can actually take the fight. You also have to be persistent. Keep hitting the space. Keep making timers. Keep making them put in effort for the space. Keep dropping cheap raitarus, they dont cost much and you dont actually lose the shit inside so theres little risk. 
---
Eventually you'll be too big of a pain in the ass for them from continuously making them do boring defense/sov timer fleets, and will probably just let you have the system.
---
If they are smart they will still try to have a token group of more serious/dedicated players to fuck with you the same way, but I havent heard of that being the case that often so good luck!
---
What ?
---
:o
---
As previously stated you can make good isk doing the gas sites. You gotta be careful as you only got 20mins from warp on until the rats arrive so bring a prospect that can dig tank them or venture and warp out after 20mins.
---
Do c5 or C6 gas sites that's where the dollar dollar is us Rykkis guide to see what you can get in each site.

If you want to live in npc null. Go check the space out and get a wormhole to move ships to a station there.

 Covert ops is your best bet to hit and run groups. After a good few burner missions you can set your self up with a spy toon in your enemy's space. 
---
Afterwards get to know the npc null locals.

Whatever you do don't listen to any recruiters in r/eve most are part of hidden pet blocs that will appear to be a small group in scale but apart of a circle jerk ring.

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
who knows maybe you are the same person :)
---
Holy fuck yes
---
Indeed I did.
---
Yes it’s totally possible. Yes these groups exist. But the general impression you get from this subreddit is also true: it this has become a marginal way of playing nowadays. 
---
Here is why: It doesn’t actually take a lot of people to take and hold sov at all. The mechanics of it are extremely unintuitive, repetitive and boring though. Most of it relies on avoiding direct confrontation and win by attrition because you have more perseverance at doing boring and cancerous stuff than your opponents. So basically any small group with one or two guys that are really dedicated can take space just fine. The problem is that eventually these will burn out. The other problem is that there is no real benefit of owning space unless you can achieve supercapital supremacy over it and defend against whaling blobs. This mixture of boring sov mechanics and lack of benefit from owning the sov itself for small groups makes it so that this kind of approach has become very niche. If you find some inner motivation in owning and defending something then you should go for it. But this motivation gets old fast. After that you can often find a new motivation in making the life of others miserable. But even that powerful drive dies out after being cancerous for to long. That’s why people complain for years about these mechanics.
---
Nice and welcome to New Eden. That’s a great attitude to have. We hope you stay !

They've been around for ages, I remember poop sock mining in december 2016 - march 2017 when rorqs were fuckn broken and Inner Hell was a very real threat. I always went through my mind the steps I would take if I get jumped by IH every now and then, kind of like a safety drill, since I ended up multiboxing 10 rorqs at one point. Kind of surreal when I look back on it. They were pretty much the equivalent of the boogeyman if you were just a pure krab. 
---
I just remember really wanting to join them or a similar group like them, but sad that I couldn't speak russian. It looks like so much, just dropping into any system in null, destroying some shit and then just moon walking out. I kinda wanna play EVE again and sell all my assets and scale down to 2 or 3 chars so I can live out in a WH and do similar things, albeit on a much smaller scale if need be.
---
Google "eve can I warp to it" and the forum eve-scout site is your go to

Top left corner - there should be search input. Lookup "jita" without quotes. You're looking for a station named Jita 4 Moon IV Caldari Navy Assembly Plant. Right click - set destination. Go to that system (you can probably use autopilot and it'll be fine, although manually is faster). Dock in station. To your left there's a bar with buttons. Look for the Market - looks like chart. If it isn't there, click top left E button, business, market, drag it to your left bar. After you opened market, type name of a ship you want into search input. Since Jita 4-4 is the biggest trade hub, it's likely be there. Sort orders by price and buy lowest one. There, it's done.
---
Entire post written from memory, there might be some small inaccuracies.
---
It's a message from CCP to tell you to stop dropping caps all the time.
---
V4DER is now in Bastion - but that's sad to hear
---
Is jita near the minmatar spawn or does that not matter
---
Probe positioning my dude
---
The short answer is no. There are a few exceptions, but as a new player you won't be able to fly any of these for a long time.
---
No. Only capital ships need fuel to use a cyno (teleporting between systems).
---
Great I was worried about that
---
Still ruled by mittens overall sadly
---
Same goes to your Komodo pilot. :^)
---
No
---
The trade hubs for Minnie's are Rens and Hek
---
Definitely won’t matter.  In your Neocom theres also a module called regional market.  You can search any market in the region you’re currently in.  Jita is only the biggest market hub but it’s by no means the only place that you can acquire ships &amp; modules

Looks almost like a catalyst knock off

Avoid Googling anything, all guides, and especially the Killboards. ignore all of it and just enjoy the game and the discovery as long as you can. the moment anyone says "isk/hr or KB stats, run the other direction"
---
Oh no, I get it, but what you fail to understand is that brawling doesnt scale well in small gangs.  Because you have to engage at scram range you are at the mercy of the group you are fighting, if they decide that they want to blob or drop caps there is nothing you can do, you are just going to get dunked.  They work for solo and maybe with 3-4 people max because it's easier to coordinate, split people up with gate aggression etc.  I'd love to take out a brawling gang, believe me, but the sad reality is that they will get dunked by blobs and caps 95% of the time.  With kiting gangs you can at least use range and control to fight a larger force, they are just better, and that's why people use them.
---
There's that classiness again.
---
What an absolutely idiotic viewpoint. 
---
How many broke kids are there out there, who will play alpha, and then sub once they finally have the money, since they've already invested time into the game. 
---
It's a lot easier to invest in a game when you've already made some decent progress. I know this. I was a broke kid burning through free trials at one point. 
---
Also the game needs players. Few people this day and age will pay for something before they know what it'll be like. Especially a game as hard to get into as eve. It's also more accessible to have a free trial, more players us better for the game, even free players. People sub from recommendations, word if mouth etc too. If they can try it first, this is more likely.

i'm just using CCP's statistics of new player shed
---
Blame CCP for?
---
This won't save OP now, but for everyone else:  
---
[Enable 2FA](https://secure.eveonline.com/Authenticator/) for your accounts.  Use [Authy](https://authy.com/download/) or [LastPass Authenticator](https://lastpass.com/auth/) for a cross-device, backupable 2FA store; don't even need a phone.
---
EVE Launcher and Website let you avoid repeated 2FA codes, so it's not annoying after the first setup.
---
Don't use the same passwords on multiple sites -- get [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/misc_download2.php) or [1Password](https://1password.com/downloads/windows/) or similar.  A super secure website is [only as good as the worst website](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) you shared its password with.  2FA can still help if you insist on shared passwords.
---
At worst, at least secure your e-mail because you're hosed if it's compromised.  Just think of all the password resets someone can do with your e-mail account!  Use a unique password and enable 2FA if at all possible.
---
Secure e-mail is especially important for EVE because you can get EVE 2FA codes via e-mail!
---
I understand.  Believe me i tried it.  Not my way.  I just dont have so much time i had few years later. I think daddies of little capsuleers will understand me : )  i just cant force myself to log in with another char,  the old ones are even harder.
---
the game mechanics.. duh... its killing the game
---
Imagine being this mad, nice raven fits btw last night lol.
---
I saw one botting trig sites with 6 gilas and not even looting...
---
Finally giving up, Amuptee? Good! Know your place. Lol
---
Lol wow someone sucked ass at eve
---
Definately not worth starting over. Plenty of other fun games out there dude..
---
&gt;they are all bluetral together and instead of fighting just grow their economy and get richer and richer.
---
I agree that this is a huge problem, but nullsec alliances being hired for HS wars is not the issue imho.
---
Lol what did they think was going to happen?
---
Ah, the ol’ “shoot to recruit”!
---
thanks for your contribution to this discussion
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/1003504908/ Based on your name and the area of your kills and losses this must be you. Not much of a pvper based on this.
---
I can't say as I've ever had any experiences in this game that I wouldn't trade for all the money I put into it...but that's not entirely the fault of the game. That was my fault for trying to stay involved during grad school. Very quickly became a training simulator for me.
---
Pacifier followed by loki. Since I don't like drones too much, these are my favorite for a nomadic lifestyle
---
Oh wise one, tell me about that "story" that OP so wishes to continue pursuing... exactly, there isn't one, so go fuck yourself...
---
Most people try out missions and the SOE epic arc usually
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Blood-Stained_Stars
---
Exactly, finally someone sees the light and understands that CCP is a greedy corporation where the bottom line is everything and the consumer can go fuck themselves...
---
Yeah, i use this thing called common sense, its the best antivirus a person can get.
---
but *MY* ideas are good cant u see????????????
---
AND HIS FORMUPS SHORT
---
28k is fuck all. It's pathetic.
---
Mmmm. Sounds great! Have a nice time of the day, and eat a cookie. People tell that eating helps to be more positive.  You need 2 or 3 of them. Fly safe bro!
---
Scrub...
---
You can try pfa
---
You can click show info on the web itself in the in-game fitting tool to see how much it slows the enemy by.

Velocity Bonus = -60%

Hurricane, HFI, Sleipnir. That hull looks like an off-brand Star Destroyer and I love it.
---
It looks like battery acid
---
 
---
yum
---
You can only compare Eve's success to Eve's success.  It used to be successful when it had 30 odd online at a time.  There are like 3 MMO's that's above Eve.

why are you booing him, he is [very much right](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Dog_meat_at_Gyeongdong_Market.jpg/1280px-Dog_meat_at_Gyeongdong_Market.jpg)...
---
Who?
---
the largest 22mm 5 cow in history
---
Pure Blind has some small alliances
---
IOU 1 Levi kill, gl wherever you end up dude
---
It's almost like eve isn't for everyone
---
Then: Goons losing shitfit krabs, lol Goons bad.
---
Now: Goons taking steps to prevent loss of shitfit krabs, "We have leadership shooting blue titans, supers and rorqs because they aren't fit right to satiate their own boredom."
---
&gt; In Sov Null space the anchoring of Citadels would be tied to the  presence and ownership of a TCU. Currently the TCU is under valued as a  sov structure, by tying anchoring to the TCU this would increase this  structures strategic value.  
---
We don't need to increase the value of the TCU. We just need CCP to remove the fucking thing and use the IHUB for sov shit. Having these structures separate is nothing but a headache.
---
I don't agree with tying structures completely to sov, btw. While structure spam is definitely out of control, there kind of needs to be a mechanic that allows structures to be put down offensively. It's often a critical step in an offensive, without which it would be all but impossible to contest the home-field advantage of a group.
---
AUTZ has always been around 15 thousand. Always. You're pulling figures out if your ass
---
Ethereum or bust
---
If you're whining about losing a fight in a help newbie forum thread, you might be lol
---
Who's salty? The whole point of the post is basically props to Jump for giving a great fight and not doing the usual boring response.
---
literally the only way we got any kills lmao, til y'all brought that devoter in. Heavy armor is tough to break, and we didn't have mass on the hole to bring any more bhaals/scorps :( but yeah, he was dualboxing Ponti's, he's one of our best boosh pilots. Mort does work lol
---
1) stop giving up easy kills
---
2) people stop coming for easy kills
---
3) less shitheads in your space
---
4) eve online: 2019
---
Ok wormholer

the one lord of lowsec still left
---
It’s so every potential target is a effectively bait. Gets the trespassers killed and discourages hunting in our space.
---
I did reship both chars, was through a crit hole so basically destroyers were the biggest reinforcements we were getting which worked out nicely for me lol
---
That damn Devoter though, I didn't catch then name but many angry words at them.
---
fair
---
came here to post this so take my upvote
---
Dont repair or it loses its luck
---
God forbid people bring you content
---
which we 100% appreciated, for sure. Good Fight!
---
Honestly I love ratting hauling and mining in that order. I’ve been grinding hauling missions to try and get past the terrible lvl 1 ones, and I have a basic dragon that I rat with when I get bored lol
---
Oh no this is on the same account and I still use my old character as a bank of sorts, I just was fiddlin' with a new character since my old one was all over the place. Only remember doing combat with it and rushing up the Caldari ship lines and ending up with a decked out Raven.
---
sometimes i really really hate wormholers. this post is why.
---
Lol, NC now bragging about killing procurer fleets LMFAO
---
And? One supercap loss and one rorq loss? You seem to think we care :P
---
Time to play the lottery
---
OR, people could take personal responsibility, somewhat, for the health of the game as a whole and make decisions on an alliance and coalition level to foster content and promote pvp instead of denying it. But a lot of people would rather just watch the numbers in their wallet grow and play farmville in space
---
But still not vertical....
---
Lol beat me to it
