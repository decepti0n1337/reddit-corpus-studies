While we're at it let's shut down dotlan and any stats the in game map / agency would show. Also hide the total number of current online players.

Reminds me of that time the Goons baited our Frigate and Destroyer fleet with a Moa that had a covert ops cyno. They just dropped many, many T3C Lokis, iirc on our gang.
---
The moa was wprth as much as everything we lost, apart from one or two faction frigates we had.
---
We knew they were bored and looking to drop and fight, but so were we, there was nobody to fight that evening.
---
ahh yhea thats right.... i always forgot moons....
---
I think if the players choose it. Then so be it. If you're a hunter and you want to have local blacked out, then why would you keep local up in your own space? That's hypocritical.
---
&gt;When we go hunting they don't have 10 minutes of warning because we show up on their doorstep 
---
We know the second the hole spawns and the second you hit local with even one person in system, we have a lot more warning then you think. And most us proactively scan for holes when they spawn and check to see who lives there and what other connections there are.
---
Now, are they watching it often enough so that they spot the cloaky covert cyno ?
---
Still more work than passively scraping the local member list.  And it doesn't help them once hostiles are in system.  Did they leave? Did they log? Are they cloaked? Who knows!
---
You talking about the map? Isn't that delayed?
---
thanks Lotus, you of all here are great help.
---
+1 for excellent sysadmin joke.
---
If you found bros you enjoy flying with that’s a big part of what makes Eve great. However, I think you should get away from the fear of risk - embrace that shit.
---
You can get 750k for referral plus 1 mil for the $5 pack if you wanted, but you have to get to 5m SP before you use them so that you will be able to extract them.
---
I personally wouldn't do that, but I respect the choice regardless.
---
Fleets. Small fleets get cap dropped all the time. You're an idiot. Cloaky campers will also sit in systems all day and cyno up a hotdrop on some poor VNI that thinks he's AFK.

2000-2400 sp/hr is standard, depending on how fast your train cybernetics and do your remaps and if you can buy +5s. 1.4m to 1.7m SP per month as an Omega. Higher with boosters and stuff.

I love moments like that.  We were doing a bit of random roaming last Sunday and after we killed some people on a gate an Aeon landed on grid as we were warping off.  That was a gorgeous moment, I just wish my recording of it wasn't corrupt.  It was the first time seeing a live, piloted Supercap on grid on a non-test environment. Loved everything about it.

Been saying this forever.  Lowsec FW was some of the funnest times I've had in Eve.  Does it have its limitations? Sure, every area of space does.  But I think the opportunities in lowsec are almost infinite and I wish more new players tried lowsec before leaching onto the null blocks that currently exist.

They even made the button bigger too just for you guys

you pushed for all these changes bruh, I told you that you don't understand shit from chocolate when thinking 3-4 steps down the road, now you get to suffer from your lack of foresight
---
Exactly my point, w-space has been dead for years because no local only appeals to a tiny minority of people. Removing local won't magically make those people embrace it.
---
And with the hundreds of system out there for them to use its still a decent dice roll chance that no one finds them and kills them

You can only hit 1 system before you're on Intel. Also check Dotlan for empty space in null. It's incredibly unlikely to just appear in a good system

Yeah numbers were off, it was 1.45B per multiple training certificate and you get 1.8B for extracting the skills netting 350m per character by setting a month long skill to train and extracting. Not so profitable without the multiple training certs I read wrong.

these implimentations were aimed to give hunters advantage, and neuter 0.0 / nullsec - I want them to know it benefits us and hurts these afk pvpers more

---
Nope. You're delusioning like [the last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c9z7ja/inspirational_response_from_mittens_only_reason_i/et56n8c/). You basically associate me with whatever you don't like. It's funny.
---
Try moving the EVE up to the top where there will be a bit more contrast.
---
Then maybe move the text at the top to the bottom, and change it to "reeeeee"
---
Of course. So instead of making it screw one side or the other. Let the players choose. Then no one can complain. Blackout your system or not.
---
Almost as if Vily took out their dog and shot it in the head. Twice.

after solo roaming for 4 hours in empty chinaland systems i can confirm that there is noone to hear you scream.
---
Senpai
---
&gt; Lol people absolutely prefer groups that will fight back with similar numbers.
---
It won't be similar numbers.  It will be mass blobs every time as groups consolidate to ensure that all their krabs are under an umbrella.  You'll either tackle a rorq and get supers dropped on you, or tackle a rorq and get a 100 man fleet dropped on you.
---
Soon you can scream in local and won't necessarily know if there's anyone there to hear it.

&gt; Its happening because CCP has been given some undisclosed business goals that they have to meet in order to unlock $200 million in funds from their new owners.
---
That's really interesting... I didn't know that. This all makes a lot more sense now.
---
There's two out towards Torrinos that are 100% for sure Chinese bots. I've watched them for quite some time and their behaviour is not that of human players. It's far too regular in time and location. I found one of their safes and engaged and he didn't do anything.

Nope. I'm just killing Goon ships.

Why do you think ccp is doing this null blackout thing? They can't get the chat service to work, so the only option is to turn it off
---
I'm very confused
---
*Screams inside Abyssal Trace.*
---
I quit when I stopped plexing, but my alliance had a channel specifically for calling the appearance and departure of hostile and neutral ships in a given system.
---
For what it's worth, I thought it was pretty funny.
---
Simple they start crying for umbrella nerfs and if they get that, ships they don’t fly need nerf.
---
Is it in a structure you can asset safety it from?
---
It doesn’t matter if it’s destroyed or not. They’ll move it if you’re restricted from the station but it’s only one ship and its contents and anything with a jump drive isn’t eligible. 
---
I don’t know if they’ll move it if asset safety is an option though but couldn’t hurt to try. In the past I used it once to move a ship from a station that changed alliance hands.
---
Just a stream overlay
---
I don't know about others, but if we see an obvious cloaky in our region we will definitely prep a response fleet if we have haulers or miners active. Without local, we don't get that luxury.
---
People don’t like when we talk of this stuff, even though it’s fairly common knowledge. But let’s just say no one has to actually be watching.
---
Better than someone setting up bots at down time and passively making income while they are at work. This way you HaVe to be at the keyboard.
---
Do one with “NULL one can hear you scream” instead
---
:facepalm: Daaad!
---
Cool please send location will totally not perma camp it.
---
&gt; proposed suggestion is that local is only delayed by 15 seconds.
---
That's not what CCP defines as delayed local. From the recent devpost announcing the 48h to blackout: "This means that it will behave as local chat in wormhole space, with pilots only appearing in the local population listing should they choose to post messages."
---
Uses normal mouse: This is fine.

Uses mouse with 6 side buttons: Good utility, I cant imagine not using these.

We can probably kill your camp do.

It's literally undetectable, especially if you use random time between clicks or a mouse recorder instead.

You winning the CSM means some other highsec shirker didn’t get the seat, and people already think you are a joke / consider your ideas dumb (*as clearly illustrated by the latest changes unironically hurting the 0.0 hunter*). So now instead of some shitter from highsec who might be taken a little seriously that seat was replaced by someone who is a total meme. Everything working as intended :P

---
Ships are always the wrong thing to make in industry. Some ships will net you a little bit of profit, but will only really be profitable if you make hundreds-thousands.
---
People who make money with ships usually do it because of this:
---
1. They mine all of their ore, so the material is essentially "free" to them.
---
2. They get ore for cheaper than Jita because of corp buyback programs
---
3. They supply doctrine ships for big alliances 
---
4. They bought a ton of ore when it was much cheaper.
---
5. They produce ships for a specific market that's not in Jita.
---
You're better off looking at modules and also T2 stuff. They usually have bigger profit margins.
---
Breathe...breathe....now look at what you wrote and ask yourself it makes sense lol
---
But the Goons are irrelevant they don't even know how to C6 rat.
---
With all the krabs joining the riot or staying docked, wromholers are gonna probably end up fighting lowseccers in nullsec while they watch hidden in their overspammed citadels for local to come back.
---
It's gonna be awesome.
---
(Either that or massive Titan's gatecamps)

Don’t.  Just don’t. Let them have their 15 mins.  When the logged in player count stays under 10k during the blackout we’ll see who’s crying.

No its wrong baity and frankly unoriginal.

Your question is framed on a playstyle I don't engage in, i.e. a focus on isk per hour.

If my argument that one should focus on what they find fun isn't convincing, you'll have to look for someone who shares your hunger for isk/hour for advice.
---
NPC stations have docking lists and can be accessed by anyone. Player structures display the count of docked pilots from the outside when you have them selected. It’s not perfect but far from impossible to get a decent count from an enemy staging point.

Nice video and story. Fk Snuff btw.

WHBOO!

Are you insane man?

Is your internet unstable or just slow?  Mine used to disconnect or lag really badly (another computer was overpowering the wifi) and I just couldn't play until I'd figured out a way around it.  My speeds now are nominally the same, but I haven't had any problems at all.
---
Some tasks in Eve can take hours (depending on how you play).  You don't want to get a server disconnect in hostile space.
---
Joining one of the big null newbro corps (horde/karmafleet/etc) would be a good way to do it
---
Slow. I live in an area where the only thing available is the hotspot on my phone so...

Police brutality jokes are for dumb racist idiots who are not socially just or warriors.
---
since eve runs on 1s ticks, having a ''bad'' internet shouldnt really affect you much like any fps for example. ofc, this all depends on how bad your net actually is...
---
no u
---
I set "Launch Drones" to Shift + F so that I could then send them against a target with F.
---
I don’t get it, I can read it just fine, and my brightness is way down. It’s not black on black.
---
This is cloaked salt
---
Well, if you don't have to worry about data plans, battery life, and so on, you could give it a try.  Eve doesn't take much bandwidth so long as it's steady.
---
For the time being. Chances imo this is a temp test to see what happens and go from there (either shitcan or introduce with new mechanics). Lots of salt and righteous indignation from both sides in the forum thread though.
---
It's time for you guys to start doing Null Sec roams for fun. :)
---
My momma always said, “Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.”
---
I wonder just how much this will help lag in large battles.
---
We will sir.
---
I don't think you get it at all.  Every nullsec region is like this.  It doesn't matter if it's a capital response or not, if you enter with a gang, you don't get a realistic fight.  Delve, foutain, cache, drone lands, it doesn't matter.  At least in delve you might encounter some other group that enjoys fucking with goons.
---
I think it's great and perfectly fitting.
---
Ok that’s awesome thank you!!
---
Turning a cyno into something with negative effects like hic bubble/siege/bastion would be interesting.
---
Also, don't let a rorqual cyno if it's in Indy/PANIC
---
If you are pulling private info like char data you will have to auth first (  [https://github.com/esi/esi-docs/blob/master/docs/sso/README.md](https://github.com/esi/esi-docs/blob/master/docs/sso/README.md)  ).  It isn't easy, you might look at the code in the GESI for ideas ( [https://github.com/Blacksmoke16/GESI](https://github.com/Blacksmoke16/GESI) ).  I've done it for a Python app ( using  [https://github.com/Kyria/EsiPy](https://github.com/Kyria/EsiPy)  ) and a web app (manually) but not a spreadsheet so can't help\*.  I really recommend using Google sheets and GESI...  The developer is quite active and often on ESI Slack...  
---
\* ok, I used CREST with a spreadsheet using the predecessor to  [https://www.xlwings.org/](https://www.xlwings.org/)  but you need to have some Python experience.  Using ESI should be equally possible, now that I think of it you could probably use EsiPy too.
---
I looked at this on my phone, and now I can see it fine. I guess it just depends on the screen.
---
It's not tho
---
For what it's worth I've played Eve on my phones hotspot many times, down to 2/7 bars of 4G and it worked fine.
---
Oh fuck yeah :) poor proviblock tho lmao RIP, blops for days
---
&gt;and my success actually caused Steve to get elected over Sort
---
Steve has always been on CSM, that's a moot point.
---
&gt;Keep going mate I'm so triggered.
---
Everyone noticed, you don't have to talk about it.
---
&gt;CSM seat at the 3rd highest spot.
---
Lol didn't you barely just get enough to get elected - like 10 more than Sort? Just imagine if you didn't have the 200 Marshy &amp; Olmeca alts voting for you, not even on the radar hahaha.
---
I dont know man..... we are usually rather persistent when we hunt... and 10 hunters doing 10 systems each covers a lot of ground very fast
---
pod yourself
---
Then why would you continue to do the thing supposedly designed to force ccp to change it back if its so helpful and good for you.
---
I don't fear it, I just continue on as I normally do.. All you idiots reeing about how this will give you more pvp content when in reality you'll just be ganking ratters and miners, so nothing will change.
---
Thanks for posting video! Need more people recording and posting it.
---
Well, it was sweaty fight for our logi, we heard constant panic messages that "we can't rep him" and also once "brutix is dead". Also, this assault damage control is kinda tricky thing.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

I just think it's funny the lengths you fucking chodes will go to to try to throw a tantrum about the changes. My post was sarcasm in case that went over your head.
---
4, they tanked at the edge. In fact, it was more interesting fight from their perspective ^_^
---
Credit goes to /u/Winsteadstarsong and the rest of siege green - he couldn't post it himself because his account is too new, so I posted it for him :)

I have watched this multiple times. Can't stop laughing at the Loki appearing as the guy boops his head through the window, that little "ping" sound just before the hull alarm. FANTASTIC!
---
Many botters were multiboxing alpha vnis or alpha gilas. This won't change plex prices.
---
You will hardly ever use this. Especially if you are in nullsec...or will you?
---
I think starting new players off with half of the skills already learned would retain players.
---
maybe in the current version of hunting. But you won't be just checking local and skipping the empty ones anymore, you'll have to bounce 2-3 times for an average system and 4 or 5 each with the big ones just to dscan everything before you move on.
---
&gt; A lot of dudes cashed out when korea first came in
---
I imagine most of us came back because there's no other space sandbox option to replace Eve.
---
I'm pretty sure Forrest's momma wasn't thinking about a Dread Bomb or 50 cloaked Lokis when she said that.

This and it's Summer.

I see what you did there, now they will never guess our secret hand shake

huh?

omg lmao.

This should be on the launcher.

They can't even cap chain properly and supers can't be brought to C6.

---
this word means the opposite that you think it does
---
the goon brigading is real
---
As far as I know, we did not use any jams in this fleet, well, maybe somebody used ec-300 drones, but I'm doubtful about it.
---
It's art. He's hiding the text, just like people in local will be hiding.
---
My tinfoil hat agrees.
---
Why you have to bring Frankly’s issues into this?
---
The bots at gates will pass the info to their bots running anoms and they will auto dock.
---
Sucker. You know it's only gonna last a week 😭
---
You are Boss?
---
Well, have you got any proof for that claim? Maybe you are the impersonator
---
No more fatigue for taking JBs, so there's that...
---
Same. Let’s do this.
---
Contact me at the official email address or ingame.
---
I don't trust you.
---
It’s a James Bond Reference to his 007
---
I never thought I'd be relevant enough to have imposters, but here I am lmao
---
Where's your chaperone? Someone your kinda special shouldn't be allowed to wander alone and impersonate people.
---
Not if capsuleers come through a wormhole or log-off trap!
---
Well how's ya sister?
---
&gt; Lol didn't you barely just get enough to get elected - like 10 more than Sort?
---
Thanks for demonstrating your dumbness with each false datapoint so I don't have to :)
---
Well I don't really care but you could maybe edit a screenshot of your character sheet to the op for everyone to see
---
ya, this would be one of the few times where someone would be using "ironically" correctly, but he goes and does it wrong xD
---
Does NCdot know?
---
If that were is the case, watch DT on the 12th hit, and local will still be up and working.
---
We're mostly concerned about a particular person in our corp that always gets left behind while roaringly high as fuck...
---
Well are you the Sindicate of Singularities guy that keeps impersonating us?
---
Youre thinking of Overseer Kurush my guy
---
Seriously? Never seen either of those options.
---
This is great!
---
Fake Kurush is Fake
---
I didn't think it's quite that good, but thanks friend!
---
I have candy in my spaceship you can trust me just get in.
---
Now I see what you were saying. Sorry. Past beer thirty here.
---
It’s going to be significantly harder. Hopefully it will now take more investment than it’s worth. Idk. Time will tell better than me guessing.
---
Either way. Hunting starts Friday.
---
Thanks
---
So going to enjoy hunting the hunters. 
---
No your Loki isn’t the most dangerous thing in Delve... the night is dark and full of terrors.
---
3 days left to train recon 4, even longer for 5

SYNDE_Diplo_Official your trash boy
---
Not if they get a huge boost in popularity
---
Viewing the poster on a dark background makes a huge difference
---
I'm hoping for, but not expecting that.
---
Well yes, hence why thats not how its done at all
---
Who are you Mr. Crittikal? Are you dumb?
---
I love the low-viz text, searching for what you know is there put a smile on my face that you nailed it.
---
Literally who?
---
TEST is dumb.
---
It'll be mixed. Some won't even login to their null soft home, while others will come back and pillage. So... probably no change. But the outcome will be a better Eve.
---
Is that you theo?
---
im salty, volta cannot be me.
---
pretty close to the women theyre acting like over the new trading tower HOHOHOHOHOHOh!
---
One side will logoff. The other side will login. No change in numbers, but a better Eve experience.
---
As much as I love that movie, I regret only that there's just one upvote to give.
---
whats a goku mean?

Im your father get in the kitchen and wash the dishes..No more wifi for you kid.

The firt two shouldn't be a problem... to the third who knows, the game has an unlimited free trial, give it a go and see if it works.

---
Dude /u/Cyrus_Kurush is the real one duh.
---
Yeah you sound very sarcastic right now lol
---
Killboard warriors still get to jerk off AND we solve all the free intel problems. It's perfect.
---
Yes, but you didn't say `2*o 7`, you said `2 * (o7)`, which, due to the communitive properties of math is `2o 2 7`, or reduced down to `o7o7`.
---
^^^^^^itwasajoke
---
That is true, and there probably aren’t gonna he as many people logging on just to gank like a lot of people are whining about. The market getting fucked with might make PvP a much more expensive activity though, but it could also find a good equilibrium eventually. I still think something should to be introduced to counter this at least a little if it stays
---
So will local chat still work? It just wont show who's in the "room"? 
---
Nothing wrong with that in my opinion.
---
Spai
---
So what are you going to do with the other two months after you have been dropped on by titans for the five hundredth time?
---
If you have an apple, and you divide it zero times, don't you still have one apple?

---
THERE'S A BAR IN FAR BOMBAY
---
Those are the current numbers, remember that PLEX price, extractor price, MCT price, and injector price ALL vary day by day, so taking a snapshot right now does not really accurately represent what you will or wont make a month later when you've gotten all those skillpoints. Also, there is the investment cost of a minimum first PLEX month (more if you don't get the free 5mil sp from alpha) as well as +5's. If you DO train the first 5mil sp, you have to decide if you're going to do all three slots (which would be most optimal) and realize how much of a time investment that is before that account will be able to be used for farming at all. What it really ends up being is people who have established all of that start up having the money to invest a bunch when the market swings are in their favor, and then either riding it out until it swings back the other way, or just eating the difference to keep their isk flowing.

You the fuck! all ever!

In Soviet Russia the text proofreads you!
---
Don’t worry, op. He’s really saying Boo-urns.
---
You sure? Because if you listen closely you can hear " TWO FUCKING DICTORS"
---
Good one. Get out a here you rascal.
---
&gt;TL;DR: Both sides of this event have good points.
---
ENLIGHTENED CENTRISM? In _my_ EVE?
---
It's more likely than you think! Get checked today!
---
Excited for this change my dudes.
---
i stay out because i keep hearing complaints about stabbed bots that sit in plexes and warp off if you show up.
---
YOU NEED TO BE WITHIN RANGE TO EXECUTE THIS FUNCTION!!
---
Open fleet window from literally nothing to ctrl + v
---
There's like 4 in-game warnings well in advance
---
so smooth  
---
...  
---
just lost my wallet
---
Everyone dock up. Too much risk and you can't see your buddies in  local  to play with anyway.
---
Can I get a 'who the hell gives a fuck'?
---
Correct!
---
I played very successfully using a 4G hotspot puck while I was deployed to Kuwait. It was hell to download a patch, but the game played well.
---
K
---
Pod!
---
Well, local getting jammed and you don’t need a falcon. +1 for my post! Score! :)
---
We77
---
Ha I see what you did there
---
Should be every system... 
---
In the marine industry we have something called AIS which will show nearby ships.  One can unplug it and then people wont know you are there unless detected by radar! Or visual.
---
Aviation i believe uses a similar system called ADS
---
Well local is jammed staring the 12 and you wont need a Falcon to do it. +1 for my post :). Score!!!!
---
I finally won at reddit tee hee.
---
Confirmed.
---
Time to dust off my Curse BPCs....

You joke, but this is ccp your probably 100% right

Do you play on Tuesdays are 0200 eve time?

I wish I was wealthy so I could commission 2. Pay you full time to make EVE models.

Unless everyone going to rat and mine in one system, that umbrella cannot protect everyone. What do you do when you have 10 players in 10 separate systems screaming for the umbrella support?

Aaaaaand evicted

No, I am the real SYNDE Diplo account.

&gt;Even some basic fits for PvP ships and some PvE I believe.

If you're in the corp and have access to our Fleet-Up, we generally keep that one better-updated than our wiki. It's harder to change things without breaking the wiki than to update stuff on Fleet-Up. A good number of the wiki fits are obsolete (although one of the wiki curators has fixing this issue as his primary focus). But the various ship articles tend to have more up-to-date fittings than the fittings listed in some of the doctrines articles (FCC assault frigates doctrine, for example, seems to be pre-Assault Damage Control existing, the various PVP campuses of the corp: LowSec, NullSec, and Wormhole Campus aren't as eager to put current doctrines on the wiki that everyone can access for obvious reasons) and definitely more up-to-date than some of the articles listing corp rules (a good number of which seem to relate to pre-Citadel game mechanics).  
---
But the corp really is one of the best places for OP to head over to in returning to the game.
---
True
---
I'm huge fan of this and have been ever since it was first talked about years ago. That being said I kinda hoped they would've added some systems like possibility to remove blue guys from scanner (afaik this cannot be done right now). Also I think this will make perma cloaking even stronger, another mechanic I wouldn't mind to see limited. I would've loved to see some scanning tool things come out now that the main intel tool has been removed (for now). 
---
Overall I just think that local has become too strong of a tool instead of being just a chat system. Everything from enemy fleet size to intel reporting to avoiding ganks / finding targets, your primary tool has always been local chat. Want to see who the enemies are? Just copy paste their names into some website and voela you got a nice pie chart showing exact numbers etc.
---
No i am the real SYNDE Official Diplo account
---
They mostly come after downtime. Mostly.
---
Well shit, now I just wanna fly to Delve in a cloaky ship to watch this trainwreck happen in real time, Ultra 4k HD, uncensored.
---
If only I had access to Imperium comms so I could listen to the scREEEEEEEams
---
Tbh so do I the only people who want to fight goons more than any other eve faction are goons
---
Is the EVE Star Map also going down? If not that has a ton of useful info...
---
It will rise, MPTC's are capped upwards to 485 plex, you just have to wait for the ones on the market to be consumed.
---
Wait untill October, and then it will be ok to sell. :)
---
Same for plex.
---
All the Russian bots that rmt.
---
You mean sell order .... right ?
---
lol or high and low will not wh and null will
---
I have a stock of 20
---
Even when you know what's going on, watching Eve videos is not as exciting as it should be.
---
There will be one in the end of November (cyber day) and one in late december, and maybe black friday overall .... basically October is the safer bet.
---
Also, with the more active time of the yr, the excess will be consumed fast by February.
---
You clearly have never farmed level 4 FW missions to the tun of 500k+ LP per hour.
---
hope the bottom falls out i have a 4 bill to blow on worthless things
---
It's about to get super sweaty in the cap umbrella.
---
Use ghsol to deliver stuff from to jita specially if is to low sec.

Oh totally legit

Definitely agree removing local would be a positive change in the end. It’s too big of a crutch

the only deference in starting as a omega over alpha is you can train all the skill you can think of in q where alpha if i rember right is only 24 hours worth if its worth it for you to add a year of skill to your que then by allmeans omega if your ok loging in ever day and makeing shure you have skills in q then i wouldnt sweat it and skills traing at 2x for omega

no truer word has ever been spoken - I keep saying if CCP really wants to destroy the gewnie menace just ask the gewnies themselves how to do it

I got \~100 coming out of build so this will be nice, thanks for maniping the market for me

&gt; It was a split vote. Vily/TEST are the only members of the consortium that would have voted No, no one else made a promise and are just in it for the ISK.
---
Vily should not have made this promise to start with then. There is a reason why irl companies meticulously avoid making promises.
---
You smart man. Very proud.
---
That'd be o7o7 though.
---
...for Delve is dark and full of Supers*
---
"We have the data. Too bad we fired the Econ guy that told us what it meant." --CCP
---
It does in Delve Supers were ratting with hostile fleets in local.
---
There is a saying as long as theyre not on grid dont bother.
---
Removing local does not remove the umbrella.
---
Lololololol. God I wanna come back now!
---
Assuming you're not trolling:   
---
Goku is a fleet-comp that's Stealth-bombers without stealth-modules, plus harpies and logi, usually with some Kikimoras as well.   
---
They usually use Wormholes to get to juicy targets, and the DPS of torpedoes applies really well to capital PvE ships.
---
Take your damn updoot and get out of here!
---
&gt; If you'd seen some of the modmails we've had lately you'd understand my vexation..

See now you are required to show us these modmails, wtb olmecasalt mails

I mean then is sort of an ethnic stereotyping post but aside from the China call out this is a pretty smart move

Weekly reminder that regional local would achieve everything the blackout does AND would improve social interactions in the entire game

What if people hunt the hunter hunters?
---
Wait you don't have the BPO
---
Please skill urself!
---
Ok
---
Man o man the irony of this post is overloaded
---
Maybe if the Chinese didn't bot more than literally everyone else...
---
I thought everyone was just joking when they said remove local. Good thing to actually see it happen
---
REEEEEEEEE
---
It will work exactly the same as how WH local works. Only shows people who have recently said something in local, otherwise no local member list.
---
Who the hell is going to be dropping titans without good Intel
---
I called the PC police and they said nationality =/= ethnicity. No warrant issued. Tin foiling may continue.
---
Thanks for clearing that up
---
I was on board with this until you said anime is legal.
---
You remove ore anomalies that with cause the krabs to implode and destrou the region of delve.

Holy fuck this is good.

I like to have the following setup:
---
Recall drones on middle mouse (cause i have the apm of a stone) 
---
Lock target on alt (cause crtl is my push to talk key)
---
Delete the binding on crtl (because just because you want to talk about things you might not want to Look at all of them)
---
I agree with Ghi102's points but just a couple additional points.
---
Make sure manufacturing isn't set to Jita or Perimeter when doing the calculations. Those systems have sky high cost index's for manufacturing at over 11%. Ideally you want that to be close to 2%. 
---
Also make sure you're using a bonused structure. NPC stations won't have ME or TE bonuses like engineering complexes will. Rigged with appropriate rigs will add to the profit.
---
Mute them on comms and just ignore them?
---
shh they dont know the curse isnt the best solo ship its actually a support ship shhhhhhhh let them figure it out
---
Blops drops are going to be fantastic
---
Implying Tama is the only way into Black Rise.
---
I enjoy collecting ships, nothing more, nothing less. I just want to be able to pop in them and muck about in a different looking ship every so often just to fly.
---
But what if the text was none more black?
---
BAND
---
ls is hardly limited to fw
---
Whilst by design it’s a support ship, it is pretty good for solo work.
---
The only thing that bothers me about this is the lack of real reasonable counterplay, which needs to be addressed somehow. 
---
Meanwhile, let the games begin
---
Remember when you could go to any faction starter system and do the initial tutorial, which involved warping to an empty corvette(Guess back then it was a "Rookie Frigate") which you could simply take and be done with it?
---
I remember.
---
Anyway, make a Caldari/Minmatar alt, you spawn in an Ibis/Reaper, warp to sun, leave ship, log in on main, warp to sun, board ship, delete alt.
---
Its been over a year since the incident happened so I can't tell you, I can tell you I was trying to introduce someone else to the game and needless to say they were not very happy with the incident either. I was in a starter ship unarmed too just to make sure i wasnt "a threat". But that wasnt good enough for these trolls in the system who were gate camping.

if this event doesn't even last a whole month, i'm going to laugh at people like you who dropped a 3+ month sub for it.
---
you really believe that dont you
---
everyone - since that's the only logical response to these changes.
---
rando gang tackles some one? drop the hammer.
---
nobody's going to stage their whole supercapital armada in hostile space to counter drop.
---
All they need to do now is have clients sitting inside citadels on gate grids, watching for enemies. It will be a lot harder yes, but not impossible.  I hope ccp addresses this somehow.
---
Did someone bring a flask to contain that one of a kind salty tear drop please? If this post legit and not a fucking troll then i am glad the local Blackout makes you stay docked in Station XD

I for my Part am super exited to take part in this test.

Fly reckless o7
---
So what stops Goons from shattering the bonds of Mittens and separate ;-)

someone is salty about the changes

I take it as you personally won’t do it. Gives some weight to your advice.

i guess, just keep an eye on your drones.

I was saying booo-urns

Thanks for honest answer.

i never understood why people pod sabred tho, its so retarded. Like mate ill be asking to be podded by blues to reship why make it faster

Inevitably come from china server? You do know the influx of so called botters already happend a few months ago?
---
There is no more pilots due to come from the china server.

https://i.imgur.com/0fLhEoB.gifv

salty?
---
not at all - nobody has said this is permanent, nobody has even said it would last 3 months.
---
i'm just predicting this event won't last as long as your subscription.
---
&gt;However, why do people bot?
---
because people don't want to endure tedious bullshit busywork and think the risk of getting caught is low enough to outsource it to a machine so they don't have to endure it.
---
Lol been so long since i have opened local . In wh space its a shit waste of monitor screen
---
I don't really care if it doesn't last the whole three months, I'll show support for good game design decisions and unsub when they are reverted.
---
Just feels like our wh space expanded 🤣
---
now who's being salty?
---
it hasn't even started and you're whining about unsubbing.
---
&gt; CCP will bring PvP to Delve for the first time in a generation.

ok guy https://zkillboard.com/region/10000060/group/659/losses/
---
U just need to ddos it . Go try
---
Every where I see people complaining and also thanking ccp, I just wanted to see what was the ratio... I see know that its close to 50/50
---
Thanks vor the votes!
---
Just ddos it if u wanna shut it down
---
"Why won't this gang of frig-sized hunters engage my blingy frigate-killer?!"
---
We are being held at gunpoint and all our login credentials are held hostage by Mittani.
---
uh i was just stating my point but alright
---
so break EULA and cheat just for the pursuit of personal ingame temporary wealth.
---
huh
---
&gt;I can join TEST and become a drop in the ocean, or I can bounce through tiny orgs that either are useless, constantly at war, or just plain bad.
---
well TEST is useless and just plain bad, so being in a tiny org at least has the benefits of constant war and not being a drop in the ocean )
---
Sorry my english is not perfect I just wanted to see if a majority of people is for or against the blackout
---
Not specifically a frigate killer, more designed to tank and kill gangs with less than 3k dps total damage without cap warfare support. Actually does a far better job killing cruisers due to application.
---
i mean, it's dull and fucking tedious. i don't blame people for botting it - don't encourage it or endorse it but it's not exactly a mystery as to why people do it. 
---
lets be real, with the way drones work it almost entirely bots itself anyway without breaking the EULA.
---
the only real advantage of a bot is that you can literally walk away from your pc for more than 20 mins at a time.
---
so was i, yet you seemed to think that was being salty, too.
---
glad you understand.
---
Clearly. Someone who actually does pvp can't think that removing local has an overall negative effect on content.
---
For me, someone who does not rat or pve, these changes will most likely reduce the amount of content I get because people will be less willing to undock as they feel less safe. I honestly don't know how hard it is to comprehend that. For some reason, retards like yourself are under the impression that everyone will keep doing what they were doing after local is removed and keep feeding relentlessly.
---
Presumably this redesign touches the helios also?
---
Agree with others about celestis/lachesis/arazu looking like hot garbage. 
---
Can we get a redesign for the loki pls? I love my loki, but at the moment I feel ashamed that it looks so shitty I don’t spin it around in stations more.
---
No it fucking doesn't.
---
Yeah I think you know full well why nobody engages you. It's not fun to fight a target like that, and you know it.
---
If it says over, can I have your stuff?
---
Remember when you guys backstabbed CO2 and then among rabid criticism from your line members, you pushed this narrative that 
---
&gt;CO2 broke NIP.  We must stand tall because TAPI's reputation is founded on the fact that our word is our bond.
---
That was a good meme.  Line member huh?  What a buncha suckers.
---
Out of respect and honor?  What are you on about. That sounds like something a c4 Corp would say.
---
 Content at all costs. If it takes copying tags,  who cares?  You were dumb for copying tags and not just asking in comms
---
Except the TEST guys that roam our space do engage it, sometimes i'm the windscreen and sometimes i'm the bug. I've lost more than a few in my time and i totally get why 3 assault frigs would run but pretty sure there were at least 8. Had they all committed, overheated all the things and used close range ammo they probably would have beaten my reps and popped me. I'm not being unrealistic and expecting people to feed to me but these guys run even when the fight is fair.
---
UpVote
---
Don't try to put right and wrong into it. People bot because they value isk more than playing the game.
---
good that you subscribed 3 accounts, coverts a fracture of what i unsubbed today.
---
13-18km in length
---
Did.. you just take Nazpost seriously?

I pvp all the time. Just git gud and don’t be salty.

They aren't even immune to combat probe :(

&gt;killboard stats lmfao
---
Albion online is legit af
---
8 assault frigs is, what, 2k DPS, maybe 3k? But if any of them dies it's game over. Yeah I don't blame them at all. Maybe they win, more likely they lose and even if they win enough will die that their roam is over.
---
Cocaine, the post.
---
actually, make it rickroll, with no option to stop it, overriding "sound off".
---
I can double your isk while you're away.
---
downvoted, blocked, saged and reported
---
you won't get away with this
---
Every change CCP made in the last weeks is only promoting big Blocks. So well i guess there wont be much to do then krabbing in eve anymore.
---
won't amount to much, which is why i'm unsubbing. not gonna spend my time trying to make a living under such conditions.
---
Yep absolutely right. And people will only really undock anything worth hunting in big Blocks who can drop the hammer the hardest.
---
Know local, No fear.
---
No local, Know fear.
---
I thought the problem was in not being able to find content? Sure, you can roll statics and possibly run into someones home system but you need to throw a wh-roll-dice. In null, system gates are static so it isn't hard to know which system has more people than some other in it.
---
You've got ntn to lose though, just send it to NanoCore with a note of your expected return date
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
I think it will do the complete opposite. If local is blacked out you are only safe in the biggest of Blocks like goons, test
---
not gone, gonna sit docked, spinning ships. finally gonna see what alpha life is like.
---
Horde standing fleet chases anything that moves.
---
Alright I'm taking charge of the logi squad. I need 8 BASIs
---
I feel ashamed just for having read this.
---
The mindset in question existed for years before reddit.
---
I don't know what pvp dudes are thinking.  It's summer for many and most krabs will just barely log on.  You're not going to get a lot of content and if you do you'll need 150 loki's with 5 bhalgoorns to do shit.
---
People will adapt or they will go to highsec.
---
It can be. It can also be to obscure what ship they’re flying. Mostly it’s just for memes though
---
Or the whole game just shits the bed like the last time local went crazy.
---
watch them manage to accidentally give WH's local while null and lowsec lose it and highsec local starts listing nullsec systems.
---
Why not at least try learning and adapt?
---
"Isn't able to invade China. "
---
You didn't roam Detorid recently to actually say that. 
---
You didn't check the last 10 br either.
---
In six months we'll by including this on the list of fuck ups.
---
Imagine being so stupid you find it hard to make isk with no local.

Play eve like it's a video game and not a way to make a living.

yeah, just ask first politely and wait a minute or two for response
---
Corrupt devs, mostly dead player base, and a game that looks like it was made in 2003. I'd love for Albion to be good, but I never read anything positive about it. Is it actually fun?

Stop it, your salt is getting me so hard

No, YOU

I'm talking about the suggestion in the post I was replying to, here https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cbm3vl/blackout_from_a_nonkrab_perspective/etgk98g/
---
Damn he just got checked with knowledge. Good read thanks.
---
Requires having a spine. Or a brain that isn't made of spod.
---
The whole hisec thing was because of drifters. Drifters have been scaled back quite a bit. 
---
So no reason for it to go forwards. Just like how the Test/Frat war is going again, despite initially being paused for drifters
---
*World Ark, not Arc. Two completely different things.

Keep this posting up and you'll have to change the second half of your alt corp's name

It's [that good.](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7634/16993554105_bf13138fa8_o.jpg)
---
Again, shitters like you who do nothing but farm VNIs will get more content as a result of this change. People who actually kill stuff that drops loot will get less content.
---
Dude. When did procurers require you to recycle before you warp off? That Orca you think you can catch is like way on the other side of the belt before you know what's going on. Then I get to watch the salt flow in local as you spew about hacks and cheats.
---
No, you're that good
---
You do realise the size of the dreadbomb you would need?
---
One ishtar at a haven, 10 recons next to it 😉
---
Curse is a tragic ship for this event. Must be a move by HS groups thinking it's the perfect ship to use to get in on the fun.
---
It's true that it's mostly low effort resource gathering that gets botted (mining, anom ratting, courier missions, easy data/relic sites). This universal for all MMOs though, since there is not much you can do other than "go to rock, collect resource from rock, look for next rock" (Star Citizen does it a bit differently, but have fun multiboxing this or add drones to the mix)
---
That's just what resource gathering *is*. You can either do it yourself, have other people do it for you (usually they want something in return, like ISK) or go the botting route.
---
Sadly, you also can't just increase the "difficulty" to farm resources, because as long as there is a way that requires less effort, that's the way the bots go (they don't care about being efficient, since it is still more isk/h then being logged out of the game)
---
" CCP isn't trying to scare the care bear, they're trying to scare the cheater and purify this bot filled game. "  Take off your rose colored glasses and read Hilmar's own comments, He wants to shake up the game and admits they have no idea what they are doing and never have. To him this seems like a good idea, mainly because he doesn't play and has no idea what Eve really is and hasn't for years.
---
Because people that are used to using dscan totally can't tell when groups of ships are in the same place that's not a anom.
---
And everyone will love having to run around fueling a bunch of POS.
---
Just need more than the faxbomb
---
" Southern Esoteria, Omist, Feythabolis, Period Basis, Drone Regions, Tenal, Branch, Scalding Pass, Wicked Creek, Delve, no where is safe for botters "   
---
There has been a lot of recent highsec bot activity both in courier missions and mining, fucking with local is not going to magically solve the botting problem.
---
Then report them. show info on the characters and then hit the "hamburger bar" in the topleft corner and report. CCP checks up on all reports. It usually takes a day or two but if it's a bot, they will get dealt with.
---
FUCK that took my blondie assume way too long to get 😂🤣
---
Works well because the spy o7's in both chats, nice
---
Can someone link this sound, i fly logi
---
Then report them. If they are bots CCP will deal with them.
---
True. But then you can ask for reimbursement. And considering everything is destroyed in the abyss, you should get everything.
---
You really seem to come back to the “no KM” thing. What makes you think this would be a good addition to the game in any way? Killmails are great and teach you alot about how players fit their ships. When i’m certain im going to get the kill. I always close my eyes and wait for that lovely sound of a new killmail
---
Being generated. Game would be unplayable if killmails didn’t exist.
---
o^(2)7^(2)
---
Sorry, but if you do not have any idea what downtime is and overlook those big warnings about "shutdown", then you deserve to lose your stuff.
---
Really had to dig hard for that massive scordite there.
---
&gt; The Mittani (pbuh) has 100% told me to tell you all this. Mass PvP is encouraged and allowed in Delve. 
---
This reverse psychology isn't going to work
---
We do check if there is a POS in the same direction as the ships we are seeing on scan.
---
For a walk Jimmy!
---
Did you move from that C4 C1/C2 yet
---
Shhh he might learn something let him waste isk thinking his clever and this will work
---
It's not that good. But I'm curious  how everyone will use their recons. Some might even kraft ratting ones.
---
Youre new to hunting...
---
You dont look for drones on d scan do you?
---
True, people will migrate to hisec to use the some methods over courier botting. no structures no war eligible so only ganking is possible which is a tedious and money pit work unless you are ganking stupid people carrying 25000 plex in shuttle.  Go to any mission hub, you will always see weird toon names from the same corp warping in / out of the stations. Criminals will always have 1 step ahead of the police even IRL.
---
very tite indeed
---
TBH, sounds like you'd be better served by a wormhole corp. Naturally, I recommend MCAV.
---
Feel free to feed dreads to an overwhelming supercap fleet, I guess.
---
I suppose you know it's dumb, that's why you want other people to do it rather than doing it yourself.
---
I run a c3-ns Corp. join Thor pub to talk to one of the boys
---
More like: in null no one can hear you until you scream :)
---
It will go to a different grid every hour. Most grids are at the planets (and always the same warp in point at that planet, but not at 0 from what I've seen) other grids can be wormholes.
---
If you land near in fast align ship and warp off to a point on grid they will burn for you, even if that point is 1000km away from them and on a citadel and you are tethered up.
---
The problem is that because of *how* you worded it; some people think it's a for/against question, and some people think it's 'are they the same' question. 
---
How many people think it's a for/against question? Nobody knows. It's impossible to find out unless you re-ask the question.
---
If you want cheap mats and you HQ in low sec you could set strategic buy order locations for all the t1 mats. I would set 3 month long varying jump distance orders, sort of monopolizing orders in my region of low sec space. Over time I would amass mineral supplies in stations spanning across maybe 13 jumps and 3 market regions in either direction of my hq. if I ran low on manufacturing minerals I would take a blockade runner or a covert cloaking hauler depending on local activity. 
---
Doing this I was able to supply all the t1 pvp I wanted. Side note tho I did eventually make a blockade hauler run to Jita for t2 components. Pretty sure I was able to make 25 t2 frigates and modules from that one run, maybe more.
---
That’s if your willing to manufacture in low sec and risk your blueprints to get them in. But once your there it’s pretty cool. I would advise bringing friends tho lol. Just more fun.
---
Anyways hope my experience helps you out. Fly safe good luck.
---
yeah, sry
---
Orrr do what I did and just keep shooting them?
---
Bro just warp away lol
---
Imagine being goon FC.        
---
All those people that will roll to your space trying to kill a super or a rorqual.        
---
You don't need to move anywhere, content will come to you ... and ... you know ... **they won't see you coming**
---
Not after faxe changes.          
---
But dread count need to be bigger than titan count or they will just eat doomsdays.
---
Thank you so much! It's comments like these and those above and below that make what I do worth doing. So glad you like it! 
---
I always worry that 3D printing is going to kill handmade modelling. That's why I'm designing kits, too :P
---
Excellent!
---
If bots gotta do shitty missions for isk instead of 60m vni spinning im ok with that. Waay healthier for the economy.
---
The self acceptance of how broken capitals are by the goon line members into concern trolling about local is pretty hilarious
---
If you don't have a spy in your corp, maybe spy is you
---
You Redacted peice of Redacted.
---
Honestly you shouldn’t die in low sec unless you are just sitting there. High security isn’t any safer than low sec, there are just more incentives to not be attacked.
---
I think you'd be surprised how many of those big block multiboxing rorq pilots have pvp accounts and want null changed and went against their alliance ticket recommendations to vote for you.
---
&gt; It shouldn't be surprising; I think this feature is a pretty prime example of Malcanis' Law.
---
tbf I haven't seen many people try and claim that the change will benefit new players, but I suppose you can extend the principle to small/newer corps.
---
I predict it lasts 48hrs....
---
Being able to at least listen is important. Depending on your play style not talking might be an issue. 
---
No harm in giving it a go.
---
Geminate, Catch? I know for a fact Brave has an active 'no-caps' guideline in Catch and I've had some fun fights with Horde without being dropped on by all their supers.
---
One thing - NPC's wrecks. It's enough to find ship in anomaly.
---
When you play on that sweet 32 inch 4k monitor, screen real estate ain't a problem!
---
Still remember Scithian Painspike, when he was in Brave, shitting on Zarvox Toral 70 man fleet with his chronos and utterly owning them.  30 min layer they got to dunk a xix Nyx. Think about that!
---
I think it was the Jita thing. Points 1-4 Just mean those guys would also be making a loss compared to simply selling the ore.
---
&gt;Ideas?
---
delet
---
even if it's delayed :)
---
It be funny if pos ran out of fuel and someone got a free hel or something
---
Sorry poor person here 😢 just 2 22 inch monitors :)
---
Try www.dscan.info 
---
It will save you a lot of tile
---
I have only seen this happening when there was still an 'invisible' instance of the launcher that did not gracefully exit, therefor keeping a lock on the accounts database.
---
When it happens again you could try the following:
---
\- Close the launcher that 'forgot' your accounts
---
\- Open taskmanager and see if there still is an evelauncher.exe in the list, kill it if it is still there
---
\- re-open the launcher and everything should be back
---
Yes, the function is available. Go to your assets tab, locate the structure in question, right click and select something like 'move all items to asset safety'. You can do this with any player-owned structure, regardless of whether it is under attack or not (structures in wormholes are an exception and don't have the asset safety feature). This will initiate the process described in the guide.
---
I want to have it local, without posting to any server - much faster. 
---
Can check clipboard - thus don't need to paste and change windows.
---
i was always kind of against this before because nullsec isnt really like wormholes. But when it does happen, the only thing i can think of is Hell Yes. RESUB
---
I don't think that is completely true. You are much safer as part of a tight knit unit that communicates together, this is how most wormhole corporations work. I think a lot of small scale alliances will do just fine because of this. 
---
The groups that really lose out are renter alliances. 
---
If you're ratting in goon space you are going to see tons of false positives on dscan, because 80% of the people undocked are not going to be on mumble together, probably won't even actively communicate together, and there are tons of people there who don't even like Goons or the Goon culture but simply exist inside goons because it's the path of least resistance. Goons/TEST/Horde and other 'recruit anything with a pulse' alliances are also going to be incredibly vulnerable to being blue scouted during this period, since blue spies providing warp ins and intel for hostiles don't have to risk compromising themselves. 
---
Can you drop the hammer to save Rorquals/Supers that get tackled? Probably. It still means that Rorquals and Supers must exist in more fear and be a lot more cautious. Mining with a Rorqual? There could be 5 stealth bombers ready to bomb your excavators at any point so it's much harder to AFK mine like now with Near2/Taco open and simply pay attention when hostiles are in local. The lack of local and the ease of blue scouting means you can pre-inhib anoms much easier, which will make it riskier for the average super player in 2019 who doesn't have them on overview or know how to use Dscan. Killing capitals will be easier in general because you can be more organised before going in, currently you generally get tackle with forward sabres/stilettos and then have to burn gang there, giving hostiles 3+~ extra minutes to respond to your gang, being able to move everything up further and it being less chaotic for the roamers means you generally have less time to save capitals too. It will be much easier to bait an escalation (since you can have people in local who just stay off the grid/dscan), and also hostiles will hesitate much more because it's harder to know the real status of the system.
---
Some are just more snaked and blinged than the others
---
Have it try to keep objects in the same row/location between scans. At a glance, it'd be nice to spot the specific things that disappear (and subsequently reappear).
---
Yes, dreadbombs clearly work so well every supercapital power in the game has stopped using them, AND THEN they nerfed insurance on them.
---
Fucking brilliant. High insurance payouts on 1-way ticket ships like artycanes and dreads was a PVP subsidy. But y'all wanted to bitch about insurance as an isk faucet. Capital ratting and mining is fine, its that PVPers get their guaranteed loses subsidized that is the problem.
---
how long until you make a good post?
---
bots shitty up the LP stores are no better than bots printing pure isk in nullsec.
---
Just a heads up: in this context the word is spelled "cue".
---
[deleted]
---
I think we should just change all bans to perm tbh, and just turn off modmail.
---
Well, definitely a good idea
---
The name's bond. Vagabond.
---
Pretty much everyone is going to be hunting during the blackout. 
---
Nullsec alliances will have blops sigs you can join. Wormholers will be ragerolling nullsec statics. Even some lowseccers will be doing shenanigans in null.
---
But o7 is a single term of two products, so doubling that would just make it be 2o7 or o14. Even if it was o+7 doubling it would just give you 2o+2*7, or 2o+14. If you're gonna make a math joke, do it right 😉

“Anime is legal”

Alright that’s all I needed to hear Naz, where do I sign up?
---
Did they actually start though?
---
if only sitting in dock would cost isk like hotel
---
Please.  
---
FRT just wanted to be like you and be left to farm unmolested. Both sides "breached" the NIP, you guys just trumped up some of those things so you could claim a casus belli because the only content you had was riding the Imperium's coattails in the north or punching WinterCo.  
---
Both of these are legitimate objectives, mind you, just you can't have the "we need to shoot at people for content" narrative coexist with the victimized one.
---
RAH is unreliable since it won’t always line up with rep cycles and you can’t waste cap boost charges keeping it up.
---
His first version was "did you smelt", then he edited his post (so I edited my reply before he'd edit it further), hence my jibe.
---
I can be wrong but HS bot seem less harmful for the economy than the 0.0 ones. less isk/h injected in the economy, maybe HS missions bot are more complicated to code than just run a vni in F.hubs.  
---
there is also a problem with rejected missions and standing. they can possibily crash some LP market and be less efficient.  
---
no ambiguity here, any kind of bots are bad for the game. I just hope seeing their impact be reduce
---
No, it never started. I assume if drifters escalate again then it might, but for now it looks like either CCP was never going to keep up the previous intensity, or that Mittens was able to change their plans just by announcing an invasion of hisec
---
During a recent Gobbins Q&amp;A he mentioned that it might happen, with people just sending out bash ferox fleets, but he didn’t give a timeline
---
You seem to understand the mindset mr. Botter.
---
That’s already the only response for most groups, so no quality gameplay lost there...
---
Makes faction stuff cheaper for the rest of us. Also LP ISK is way less damaging than the direct injection.  
---
Maybe (a big maybe) it will also drive the tags market
---
Shit take it easy man... No one needs to get hurt... Let the EVE go.
---
No, Im sparticus!
---
If cap is that low then sure.
---
Not worried about rep cycles tbh, it’s about as good as an eanm and can push resists hard especially on a one type of fight like Kesha is
---
You don't have to be a bot to see the painfully obvious. 
---
In fact you'd have to be pretty dense not to see it.
---
Wasnt that already the case before the blackout ?
---
it's a situation we never se in WH, never
---
The D-scan does not pick up cloaked ships nor does it pick up combat recons, in case you have forgotten like most people who suggest it have done.
---
rule #1 of drifter fightclub : dont talk about drifter fightclub 
---
why you wanne ruin the salt mines?
---
Which fax changes again? I know they've had some iterations, what's the latest sherbet
---
This blackout is not utter BS. Now you made nullsec harder to live in then WH space. In wh space you can always close the door if you don't like what you see, and you only live in 1 system. In nullsec you will have countless of ships on your D-Scan. All from your own alliance. People just flying through a system. 
---
 And seriously.. All you PvP devine entities. How many ratters/Miners do you really think you are going to feed on during this blackout? Don't you think they all will be docked during this stupidity?
---
 Further more, having no local means a huge drop in isk making, making the huge powerblocks, even more powerfull, now that other allianceses titan production grinds to a halt.
---
 Do like me. Play something else during this BS, and if its permenant unsub and carry on
---
Fine by me then it will hopefully stabilize tge market
---
Not sure if you’ve been in WH fights, but if the FAX is primary it’s gonna be cap dry, you’re running entirely off of the cap boosters.
---
I keep saying everyone should be a Goon at least once. Now feels like the time I should apply
---
plot twist: It's falcons.
---
Highslots still f1-f8, midslots are just 1-8, overheat is shift+respective button, I never have enough active mods on any ship to use the lowslot bar. That's the only major ones. I use default controls for almost everything else but I mapped out my fighter controls and the jump navigation window is \~. I tried remapping dscan but I've used V for literally over 10 years, impossible habit to break at this point lol.

Something controversial?  Not on my Reddit!
---
Brave drops caps everywhere, and horde often massively overforms if there are more than 5-10 of you. This has been commented by other people - you basically always get the blob, in one incarnation or another. 
---
It is still possible to have fun fights, but they’re fewer and further between than is good for the game’s health. Ideally multiple standing fleets and camps make a resurgence, so even if there are hundreds of ping warriors inbound, you get a more reasonable fight with the nearest standing first.
---
"baity" bruh

but...but
---
Is this...real?
---
They're really hard to miss and you can't turn either of them off afaik. I can't show you an example atm but just find any structure, select it, and it'll have a "\[0\]" or whatever number of people is in it (you have to be on grid with it). The guests list is right next to Agents and Offices tab when you're docked.

It depends on how you have it setup sure, I conceded the point about using cap boosters to run the rah.

---
I can fly a Catalyst with eight T2 blasters. I can certainly kill them. If I wanted to and my corp had ROE permitting it, I could easily enforce the New Halaima Code of Conduct upon botters, especially since HS botters don't dock up when names appear in local. I just don't feel like it because enforcing the Code is boring.
---
There’s a storm coming Bruce!
---
you can solo mining BS's in a catalyst?
---
Wel it´s not THE best solo ship but definitely one of the best 1v1 ships.
---
Which is really dumb on his part, because he has to do is listen for the goon squeals to know if he's doing the right thing.

I have my jars ready to stock up on salty tears.
---
wishful thinking, lol

That's what Tornadoes are for. I just can't fit T2 guns for one of those.
---
Wouldn't be the first time
---
Do an anomaly filtering tool. You ctrl-a ctrl-c ctrl-v in the probe scanning window, post it to your app, and the app filters out the famous anomalies (forsaken hubs, sanctums, havens) and lists them based on their distance.
---
It would allow you to do a quick analysis upon entering a system during the first dscan cooldown, helping you to adjust the second dscan range.
---
Expand the idea if you feel it's worth it. For example, keep 5 fields in your app. In the first, the anomalies are pasted. In the second, a full range dscan could be pasted, in the third, a 10AU one, in the fourth, an 5AU one, in the last, an 1AU one. Then, it tells you for example that between 5 and 10 AU there is a VNI and there are also 5 drones visible.

Nerf super ehp. The buff to ehp was ok when there werent as many of them as now. And how cheap they are now.

The best ship for this event is a brick-tanked Turbo-Lachesis with 150 cloaked dudes 1AU away.

Already invested in buying up all the covert config subsystems.

I got the star pack on steam and sold everything for startup moneys after finally resubbing. Roommate just started playing this week and also got one and sold it for injector moneys

I see.  So I'll have to wait until it's on the same grid as my citadel to try and kite it over.  Thanks.

I’m just going to take a screenshot of certain regions on Dotlan today, then again in a few days. Because I also don’t know how to do this sort of fu.

&gt; To him this seems like a good idea
---
  It seems majority of people- Including those who are resubbing after years of inactivity think it's a good idea.
---
You are not the only one bro.
---
This is a nice TL;DR of the state of EVE for the last 5 years.

I love the idea but also would like to get CCP comment on this

Once you have the warp in point for them on a grid (combat probes bookmark) the simplest way of doing it is having a bubble anchored there and eject from a shuttle in the middle of the bubble. When they land they will burn directly towards it while locking it up before blowing it up. This will end them up inside the bubble and unable to warp off ready for you when you next login. Simply warp an interceptor to ping close to them and back to the citadel and they will follow, you may want a bookmark 1000km on the opposite side of the bubble from the citadel before hand so when you ping near them you are already aligned towards your citadel for faster warp out. They have long range remember.
---
Oh and don't dock up while they are burning to you at the citadel, only once you have them shooting the citadel.
---
You will also need to bubble them on citadel or time you point well to stop them warping off when they are low hp.
---
Okay
---
Loudest = / = majority
---
I imagine they will continue business as normal, with the assumption that someone else will be killed.
---
I'd love to see those resub numbers so we could see if it equals or exceeds the people who are quitting over this change.
---
superfleets are the very thing causing stagnation in this game.
---
Also the amount of salt generated would be nice bonus. If your posting is any indication.
---
" and 10 hunters doing 10 systems each  " How do you solo shotgun?
---
Their terms of service is pretty clear, no need for a comment
---
1000 new pvp subs adds more to the game than 1500 krabs leaving.
---
On a personal level id be ok deleting supercapitals from the game. But local needs to come back and wormholes shut down. Because lmao salt or something
---
I dunno, the people crying the loudest seem to be goons and krabs lately
---
Redline taught us how good operate

Amazing!

&gt; a manufacturing specialized corp
---
corps that are specialized in manufacturing tend to be pretty bad at basically everything
---
the deeper you get into manufacturing, the more you realize that pretty much all heavy industry is done by individual dudes with piles and piles and piles of alts
---
Yeah, too bad the rest of eve are such fucking cowards. None of you have the courage or will to fight Pandemic Horde + Imperium + Legacy and every highsec wardec alliance combined, very SAD.
---
having more people undocking and going out to PvP- which is the point of krabbing in the first place is better for the game overall. 
---
  More shit explodes
---
  More demand for ships and ammo
---
  Krabs need to maintain supply- Increased demand = higher price
---
  Krabs get more ISK per hull/bullet
---
  Stockpiling supers in an empty dust filled hanger does nothing for the game. Also fuck profits. Krab to buy ships, fly those ships to blow up other ships.
---
[first gameplay look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwH8v02H2ZY)
---
Clearly no-local was the catalyst of this fight, and the pos involved.
---
none of that addresses CCP's bottom line, which is what drives all their decisions. If more accounts quit then resub this results in a net loss for them and their new owners and a quick end to this experiment. Also for years we have had to listen to r/eve wax poetic about how a falling concurrent player count is a bad thing and its killing the game... now suddenly its a good think because r/eve changed its mind?
---
Sounds like a (not so) really well disguised "ohgodno, not blackout!" post. Just way more elaborate.
---
People hunt rorqs because there's nothing else to kill lol
---
not realy. WH corp are pretty small and everyone are on coms. so, you know aproximatively who are where and in what ship.  
---
plus, you know yours bros, what ship they like or how they name it (birds, jokes, girls names etc...).  
---
plus pathfinder show where everyone are whith their ship.  
---
yes, this trick can work sometime, but IMO, it work only with poor comunication corp (or maybe too big). it will work well in 0.0
---
We also check for Gas Sites on the probe window, doesn't mean it isn't a giant fucking annoying waste of time.
---
No. Realmlists are for WoW.
---
dumb or bait. mystery
---
Is it wrong that I think this is a stopgap measure for all the local shenanigans that have been going on (People not showing up or suddenly Jita), and not a "lets make null unsafe again" statement?
---
Asymmetrical balance at its finest.
---
You don't produce from a T2 BPO, you copy it and sell the BPCs/use the BPCs.

Imagine yourself in a rorq mining. Now hit dscan. Do you feel better? safer? more important cause that's what pvpers do all the time? or is the knowledge of that almost landing sabre helping because you know knowledge is power?
---
Well, you are right. I should have simply asked "are you happy with the upcoming blackout event?"
---
Wait? Are you saying there is a way to sub this game without the need of grinding multiple Char/hours per month in Anoms or on Moons ?
---
Praise bob
---
And since the titans are balanced and using haw guns, they track and kill the sabre

If you ragequitted because someone killed your Venture this game is not for you.

PLEX, injectors and Skins have been a bigger profit winner for CCP than simple game subscriptions. Falcon said it himself the Fanfest after they rolled it all out- they've had the most profitable year ever. And this includes Eve at it's peak 50-60k subscribed players logged in. 
---
  A vibrant game, also pulls more people into it.
---
  B-R did more for CCP's bottom line than fleets of rorqs hugging rocks. 
---
  Also implying Eve will have a net player loss after these changes = You're talking out your ass at this point.
---
  I myself have resubbed my capital alt after 6 months of staying logged off. Then there's the silent players out there who don't shitpost who just jump in without telling the world about it.
---
It is barely visible on my iPhone with black background too.
---
so nowhere. you just want that playstyle to die
---
There's a lot of posts about people being salty about no local and very little actual salt about no local.

How about a spooling time for lighting cyno in a non spexialized ship...leave the job of insta cyno to force recon ships...others should have a delay...look at activating mjd for example  5 sec and visual effect

Yea but it’s fun when falcon comes in and calls people out )
---
I just hate that I am leaving on a month long vacation Saturday morning. I probably won't see the event. My accounts stay subbed though.

Talking mad smack for someone who sits in amarr to pvp

I agree with drifters and local, its very good, but change back from when they nerfed rorquals and wetus
---
Come back to weebfleet, we miss you uwu
---
It’s a really cool idea, but will never happen.
---
Except that the botters will be the first to adapt, by simply putting a cloaked intel bot at their pocket entrance. They adapt and continue to not give a shit
---
I see your point, and you are right to some extent. I do like a risk/reward balance.
---
Still, I think there is a huge difference between "balance update" and "game-changing updates". This is sandbox video game whith different game mechanics depending on where do you play. If players chose to play the sandbox in a way, in specific part of the map where game mechanics are set in a way they have to team up (survive drama and have good leadership), it is not OK to change the game mechanics to force said players in a specific direction.
---
Anyway, I like the fact that local goes to delay mode in null-sec. But random spawns of turbo strong NPCs with an advances beta version AI onto null-sec just to create some caos, doesn't look like a balance update in my book.
---
" I myself have resubbed my capital alt after 6 months of staying logged off. Then there's the silent players out there who don't shitpost who just jump in without telling the world about it. "

And I myself have unsubbed my rorq alts after a year of sub time. For the time being my PVP focused characters will stick around, but if this blackout doesn't result in the PVP bonaza r/eve is convinced it will trigger then those will go away as well. Then there's the silent players out there who just quit without posting about it. Less people logging in and subbed is less people for you to try and shoot. Any which way you slice it fewer targets is fewer targets.
---
Krabbing recons......for fuck's sake
---
It supports its drones.  
---
I love my curse.  
---
I enjoy every megajoule of energy that little bitch suck out of my targets.

Check the forum

This sounds like it would be great for bots, have fun.

if botting is too much effort they will leave to another game with greener pastures.
---
the ones doing it for their IG isk are fucked.
---
So much truth, ping "blue ochre rule violaters to shoot" and fleet will be full in seconds, mostly titans and supers.
---
I don’t know about such things, how many dreads would we be talking?
---
Well, I hope delayed local stay. I reckon botting will be harder after local change. But Drifters are a poorly implemented mechanic and they should be reviewed or gone.
---
you can literally get a venture by accident.
---
lol in SC you first have to get behind the paywall to even try mining
---
I’ve covered a few systems each with a cloaky, an inty and a dps (some of them cloaky). But I found out yesterday I probably won’t even be able to play for the next week at least (
---
Deletes local....all chat channels disapear, along with station services window and right click menu, no way to undock.
---
I get so confused when people say war hammer 40k. There is a RTS and a solo birds eye view that are different war hammers yet carries the same name. I only played the RTS one.
---
Nah, just one dude who did a fleet warp.
---
It's hentai and it's art.
---
Yes exactly this is exactly how you can trace it. Most humans are incredibly infrequent, even if mashing the server updates on the tick, but the sent packet will have infrequent queries to the server saying hey, i hit dscan plz update. Bots have a constant frequency of sent dscan commands.
---
Even if the botters want to use a random generator to try and obfuscate their sent commands, *other computers use these generator algorythms*, and the botters will have to devise some crazy methodology to try and include randomness outside of a truly calculated algorythm - youd need some crazy inputs for a truly random code that cant be broken by a code looking for randomization code, ie a lazer emitter scanning a swarm of flies or something crazy.
---
Its definitely a thought i had on one of the main implementations of this change 
---
Bots will have a systematically
---
Why else would they remove api keys from skill. *taps the head*
---
dooooo it!!!
---
Don't be silly now.
---
Have you ever used dscan
---
1v1 @ sun!
---
easy.
---
Man, the amount of confidence you have in your assumptions here is frankly astounding. Inomares has done a good job of explaining the ways you are wrong, but let me just back them up on the key points.  
---
\&gt; EVE actually runs a synced simulation for all movement; whenever you issue a command like approach or orbit, the server lets all clients on grid know the coordinates or object that is being navigated towards, and then the server and all clients simulate this movement separately. No further traffic is generated until the ship issues a new move command, even if you start colliding with other moving objects.   
---
Yup, this is how we do it, unless new commands are issued there's no traffic between server and clients regarding a ships position. This comes with it's own issues but keeps the requirements for traffic much lower.
---
\&gt;  Dscan doesn't really have anything to do with grids. The game simulates grids separately, and a good reason for that is probably precisely so that local effects doesn't have to iterate through every single object in the whole system. Dscan however, since it doesn't care what grid you are on, would have to check objects outside of its grid, and run a distance check on every object compared to your ship.   
---
Exactly. Dscan is iterating through every ball (celestial, ship, drone, structure etc) in the systems simulation, and filtering out anything that is further than your max dscan range. It has next to nothing to do with grids.
---
5 bombers bomb to bait the panic. the 250 others wait to see what comes neeext
---
LP store is an isk sink, so this is good. they would actually help the economy

We'll see if there's a net loss in actual players a couple weeks after the blackout then

Tbh, ratters shouldn’t be able to rat so freely. The fact that eves economy is running so well is why we have 2B plex, titans and supers online, 200-400mil pirate BS, and the cost for end game ships is affordable to basically anyone. This “cleansing” if it last a few years will definitely put the game economy in a healthy state. Think of eve as having health problems and this is it exercising to get in shape. Short term, it will do nothing but long term, there will be amazing results.
---
Indeed... perhaps I overreacted.
---
smart small gangs ignore the fax when the target is a rorqual or dread in siege mode. dumb small gangs run when the fax lands. decent sized gangs will kill the free kills as they land one by one.
---
Yes. It's called AUTZ ping ☹️
---
Woah this guys calling those small gang bois shit
---
Whats this absolute chads flair??
---
*Goonswarm Federation*
---
Yeah because it's the quickest and safest response. Anything smaller and you end up with the risk of 
---
1. taking to long e.g forming or having to get stand by subs in place to bridge / move to respond.
---
2. Your response just being completely useless. Ever by it getting stuck in hostile bubbles or intercepted on the way.
---
3. Your fleet being to shit to stay together or work together.
---
4. No enough people paying attention. / Caring enough to get in the fleet.
---
DONT TURN OFF LOCAL PLZ IT ONLY HELPS BIG BOIS WE DROP STILL SAEV IT SMALLBOIS WHO BE HURT NOW
---
WE ALWAYS DROP ON EVERY COVOP CYNO PLZ NO ITS A DIFFERENT STRAIN BRO IT ONLY HELPS BIG BOIS ITS EVE 2K18 STILL THINK LITTLE ENTITY ITS DIFFERENT STRAIN BRO
---
Well, juicy targets for cloaky campers then. I'm happy to leave a cloaky afk alt until the botter forgets about me and undocks.
---
i'm doing it. with all my 5 alts. can't wait to feed to supers.
---
12 buttons and you forget which does which when you get ganked and panic sets in. lovely times. don't miss them.
---
same; at least when i hear, it i know that the dscan worked :D
---
EN24 is pretty legit dude, though unfortunately its not as populated with the long articles like CrossingZebras (RIP) was. 
---
If you stick to just jintaans stuff and dont even read any single word of INNs stuff its okay to read (dont read it, its cringy)
---
Do people *actually* check the forum?
---
there was a 50% sale on the Starpack DLC that gave you 500 plex, 1 month omega and 2 mptc and there seems to be a lot of old players re-subscribing (who might've bough plex). That's my guess at least.
---
Well, the reason you are having trouble with the game is that it took you SIXTEEN YEARS to get into a fight....
---
Good god man.
---
You've not even experienced the game.
---
If you are a bot you don't need this tool.       
---
Whole code is :         
---
1. take string from dscan      
---
2. split it to string[] based on line break           
---
3. cut the columns basically split , take and join again ... so you remove the range (that can change)        
---
4. group by name/or type (aka icon you see on dscan is a number)       
---
5. you have this now in list .... so just use .Except to check what changed with previous scan (name/or/type and count)            
---
6. list differences for you to see     
---
7. store current scan so you can compare it with next one you get           
---
This is just few lines of code that you can internally include in your bot.
---
&gt; selling it for real money, or better known as performing RMT
---
You want to tell me there are some people going: "What? Selling what for real money? What do you mean? Aaaah, you mean RMT?"?
---
Absolute fucking bullshit here. Theres like 2 writers including jin that dont squeej out some koolaid, like volcanic diarrheah on your screen. I cant read any of it because its so cringy - its even got potential to be okay news, but they just bubblezone themselves like washington poat 2016.
---
If hostiles don't reply within 15 minutes you're legally allowed to start ratting
---
There are 3600 replies on the blackout thread last time I checked 2 days ago. Its a salt mine beyond anything ive seen thus far
---
&gt;If you'd seen some of the modmails we've had lately you'd understand my vexation..  
---
RELEASE THE ~~REPORT~~ MODMAILS
---
I should have a script running that collects this kind of data since a month or two. Will see if I can do some charts.
---
Nah. Just the bots.
---
&gt; it is not OK to change the game mechanics to force said players in a specific direction.
---
That's already what the initial mechanics did.
---
So this point doesn't make any sense at all.
---
That is EXACTLY what game design is. Is your point really "EVE shouldn't be designed."?
---
Wow, ppl are dropping supers in lowsec ? That is pretty awesome
---
There will be a lot of different metrics to look at.
---
And it will be important to wait before passing judgement.
---
We need time for the mechanics to settle and people to adapt.
---
lmao
---
But then it also isn't sharable to your FC
---
PvP is legal - 90% of goons go back to being highsec pubbies
---
Wut? Adapt or die.
---
Please join my EVE Forum awareness^(TM) run on the 17^(th) of August
---
I know, I was being facetious.
---
Don’t botters use local to stay safe?
---
STOLEN CORPORATION GOODS!! 5.6B PROFIT!!
---
Yes. Up until anime was mentioned this was almost believable. The Herald hath gone rogue!
---
Lmao, no way this isn't a troll, but jeez. I often lose 10-20 ships a day, and buy them in bulk. If you can't afford to, fly something cheaper
---
Basement living neck troll
---
I imagine it's not terribly difficult to spam D-scan and use that instead for a botter. And any 'advanced' bot networks might even start using scouts on the gates or similar tactics to stay safer.
---
Honestly by the time the blackout happens the big botters will already have adapted for the most part
---
What if i’m in a cloaky ship or use a recon ship immune to dscan?
---
And when did you join goons?
---
I would be happy if they made it's somehow a lot more noticeable when chat window is selected. Should be easy to implement and would prevent so many fuckups.
---
back in ~2010 we managed to get a thanny pilot desynced by continously warping on and off grid, while bumping him off the undock. we killed it because on his client, he was still in docking range. i still feel dirty
---
Isn’t that the fucking point?
---
I'm curious are you getting lp for killing their stuff? I don't know fw mechanics
---
Scan also can't differentiate between friend or foe
---
I'm not unaware of the logic behind the reality, what I would say is that all of those risks should be a factor, rather than obviated by pingwarrioring supers to a cyno.
---
looking at flairs lolol
---
link a br between 2 good small gangs and prove me wrong
---
Removing local is not a panacea to botting but it may have some impact on the script kiddie type botters, for a while at least. Cloaked gate watcher bots are probably on uat already.
---
Two???
---
Is Providence a good place to learn null?
---
cant someone else do it?
---
Well all the feedback about blackout where small gang PvPers are actually happy about the change and resubbing makes me hopeful. 
---
That may mean there could be a noticeable increase in roaming in the null regions. This doesn't kill the issue of people wanting easy dunks and cowardly fleeing in face of the slightest danger, but hopefully the reinvigorated roamers that are resubbing are not of that kind.
---
I've seen too many person on reddit complain that small gang has been killed and nerfed to oblivion by CCP, and this is one change that finally goes in the other direction. To me that's an incentive for these people to come back, and I'm confident a majority of those are actually willing to fight.
---
.... wait THATs how your supposed to play?
---
Im such trash *despairs*
---
Or just keep it around permanently
---
so you want ability to click on some button so it will create the summary that you can paste to the fleet chat?
---
wh is for that
---
Could be quick if the dscan distance is mapable
---
Or hunting trough wormholes..
---
If you are in null you have to use info channels and in game info to keep track of threats.
---
Remember because its 4.20 am for you eve its a global game and timezones are a thing.
---
Have you checked the Combat Recon market?
---
when shit hits the fan, report the player for false advertising afterwards
---
Legally *required* iirc
---
Why are you asking me?
---
Nope - Should be permanent.
---
Not in a day. 😊
---
HUDDA HUDDA HUH
---
And bot hunter hunting
---
Til cloaks don't exist
---
That's the problem there isn't much off a risk in doing that. If someone had a force in place to be a risk to that response the defence would allready know.
---
Shit, you're ruining the narrative of all these people saying it'll kill the game and that everyone is unsubbing... :rolling_eyes:
---
I think these Intel stucutures will be constilation wide and you can shoot then to disable local in the constilation. This would be the a typical thing for CCP to introduce.
---
So you can just code in random 2-4 s on your bot, in like 100ms steps - and use data you get this way to fuel your "bot".
---
About two year's ago if I remember right.
---
Just use a fucking t3c you dummies
---
15 man "fleet" fights
---
Something to add.  Do the RAF twice to two accounts and get the benefits on a second account.  Then keep that second account details for down the road.  Never know if it might come in handy.  I have my main account thats 13 years old, and two RAF accounts on ice that I recently turned into scouts/mining alts.
---
They exist already and are running fine such as actually Well written bots
---
EVE Online player?
---
That's why I mentioned the botters might start using gate scouts or other tools to try and stay safe. Don't get me wrong I do expect more to die and it'll definitely become less straight-forward for someone to write a bot.
---
Unless they really just start dieing a ton they'll continue to make a profit which means it is worthwhile to continue botting. And if it isn't profitable to do ratting, they'll just switch to something else they can bot like the courier missions which are happening more and more now.
---
I'm a developer myself and I've had to deal with botters in other games so I just don't see a change like this being effective (enough) to do much about botting.
---
I might be wrong obviously, we'll see what happens this weekend I guess
---
Yeah really strange that both recon cruiser types didn’t spike the same amount. I mean sure you have better bonus’s and no scan res hit from the decloak, but it’s also easier to avoid people with a cov ops, and damn the stratios is just fantastic value for the price.
---
The 750k referral skill points will go a long way towards this
---
I understand the reference but I never got the joke.
---
15 men is a fleet. 2 logis, 10 dps, 3 support/tackle/scouts. A fleet.
---
HAW guns on titans do 50% less dmg???
---
And null is supposed to be dangerous, lawless space.. safest place in the game. If you want to mine and rat in piece, go to hisec.
---
My guestimate is that it will get rid of 50% of botters. They’re not gonna invest in another account just to sit there doing nothing while it could be making money. That and the VNI nerf should take care of a bunch of them. 
---
Im just hopeful that it will make a large dent in them. I predict the market is going to change for the better as well
---
Just make a button that posts the original paste to dscan.info and grabs the link from there. It'd be cancerous to try and decipher the d-scan result from fleet chat.
---
Gonna be dread bombs everywhere.
---
No, the players wanna play it that way, they destroy it (not talking about bots) but afk (netflix on second screen) ratting mining should be ok - why not?
---
I suck at Eve, so don't take my word for it, but I flew a stealth bomber out into Insmother last night to try to do some hunting when the blackout hits. My manticore is fit for short range (&lt;8km) torpedo fucking, with essentially zero tank. Hoping I can find some bots or afks who will let a shitty solo noob blow their face up.
---
And nothing of value was lost.
---
I personally unsubbed 50 accounts! Your move CCP! /S
---
What are you trying to load?
---
You are 100% correct I will give you all my stuff if this doesn't end with "Intel stucutures".
---
 hope they don't do the a typical shit like if you shoot this structure it disrupts the locks chat in the constilation or region. I hope they do something better. 
---
Thinking about it it needs to be regional imo.
---
Wait a moment  eve got sound ?
---
You mean the parts that are impossible to bot?
---
Almost 6k now. The salt is strong on the forums.
---
Is it getting removed in null or everywhere?
---
50% of a 6,000 damage volley is still 3,000 damage.
---
Both ways you're still very dead.
---
In the immortal paraphrased words of Vin Diesel, "It don't matter if you get overkilled by 2,000 or 5,000, you're still wtfbbqpwned."
---
tracking is still a thing?
---
The Stratios is criminally underused as a pvp ship. 500 dps, a room for neuts, good tank, 5 mids, huge drone bay, scanning bonus AND a cov ops cloak. It's got everything. It just can't kill a capital...
---
Well this is just a post so no problem. 
---
Ill see how many people will be interested after first version and code.
---
Tracking didn't get nerfed idiot.
---
More for me then :D
---
Haws are still are considered L size guns, these track shit against anything smaller than a battle cruiser.
---
Right that's fine and was always the case. What's your point? You made a comment about 50% damage nerf being game changing for tracking titans.
---
Not even a SC fanboy, but that's not how the actual game would work if it ever releases.
---

You need wealth to PvP. You can't replace dead ships with nothing.
---
Why do you assume it is a EULA violation.     
---
I am assuming that "copy" from the scan you get from clipboard is something like :              
---
&gt;GAY-1337 Sansha Haven 12.1 AU

So you have text outside of the EVE client that have all the information.

If we could only get rid of one, I'd get rid of the drifters. Tbh.

and then you also know that AIS is only for information and never to be relied on for navigation
---
Small boats dont carry them.
---
The starter pack is 5 bucks on sale right now and you get 1mil skill points. I think it’s definitely worth it.
---
Oh there is people unsubing because off this but there mostly people that should have stayed in high.
---
You may want to learn to read.
---
Angular velocity has an effect on chance to hit.
---
Once you hit, the damage modifier table takes over. The point is if you previously could hit the frigate, the net damage despite modifier was sufficient that it could straight kill the target, despite being only grazing, glancing or whatever.
---
That hasn't changed now. Even with the 50% nerf, while the total damage taken pre-modifier may change, it doesn't change the chance to hit, and so tracking isn't part of the discussion.
---
Net conclusion: You're still an idiot.
---
Just null
---
But they cant stay safe when there aint no local left
---
I think current STAR ? pack is pretty good.  It offers you very cheap omega and a lot of MTC and Plex at the same time. So stuff you can use or sell for a lot of ISK.
---
As a former member of bombers bar this is music to my ears.
---
Atm the starter dlc pack for for 5 dollars defo worth it. You get 1 mil sp.
---
Eh don't see it changing much beoned the risk averse ratting and mining people leaving for green pastures.
---
nekkminit bots start shooting wrecks as a priority
---
If you need anything, like isk or advice or a corp or whatever, send me a pm
---
Username checks out
---
Never sit still always orbit or manually pilot.  Lot of people drop mtus to orbit.  If the rats you are shooting do only one or two types of damage add harders for those.   Good luck
---
Synonyms.
---
there is zero counter to 5 bombers taking mining drones out. afk or not makes no difference.
---
Less than 8km? How and also rats in anom will most likely switch to you. Dont expect your paperthin bomber to survive. You need to be at max point range to have any chance. Maybe even launch a bomb to get some initial damage.
---
can i have some iSssssk please? Im about a week new but loving the game!
---
He's just jealous he doesn't get to fleet
---
depends on how bad of a pilot that sabre is..
---
That would be good, it's at least an implementation.
---
But yeah, a button that copies to clipboard the summary
---
Agreed.  Expect to see a million new faces in Delve, and I don't mean hostiles.  Anyone who wants to be able to rat or mine will flock to big blocks.
---
Not seeing the tons of content this is supposed to provide, I see big blocks getting bigger which is what all of these same people cheering CCP's name over this event hate more than anything else
---
15 ships is about my alt count
---
Minmil is also cool come join us in kamela :)
---
T3's ResidentSleeper
---
Be sure to go to dead-end systems like Venal. Tons of Chinese that belt bot.
---
I see more people getting dropped. But it's probably just gonna be the people paying attention. An on coms past a couple days so you end up with more failed attacks probly.
---
We are not talking about frigates here we are talking about sabre and due to the nerf  its not insta blab rather a sabre can take a couple of hits.
---
The $5 one is worth it for EVERYONE.
---
But especially new players since they'll get to use the accelerator and the ship skins more than experienced players will.
---
But the 1m SP is totally worth it. I would recommend not just dumping it into skills (aside from the magic 14) without really figuring out what you want to do.
---
What corp?
---
If i had to guess you were probably in favor of lurch hictors as well
---
If nobody ever said anything then we wouldn't have these problems.
---
Made so much money off this already
---
I was really hoping to dig my own shallow grave in the desert but that's a close second.
---
I think you get more benefit out of being Omega while getting the DLCs. Then again you most of the DLCs either straight give Omega time, or give you the means to do so (PLEX). All the DLCs ultimately end up in either ISK or SP anyway, and every player benefits from that.
---
The 5$ pack is good, just dont waste the sp without knowing what the skills do. Get to know the skills before you dump the sp. Alternatively, look upbthe magic 14 and use und the sp for that. Always worth it
---
Lol why does everyone think Mittens and Goons are going to be the losers in this local blackout event? Do people not realize that inside of Goons there are about half a dozen SIGs that are overwhelmed with joy that they are about to be able to hunt so many krabbers?
---
Yeah, fuck anyone who wants to create a potentially useful tool for people to use in this game. I don't care who they are.
---
Its not about whos losing or anything...
---
Clearly you don't get the joke.
---
Well yeah, its being applied during DT, the server is always low-pop right after DT.
---
#SAMRT
---
Post with your main, goon
---
We did actually
---
you may want to read that article before you give your opinion on something you don't understand.
---
Just because you could volley a frigate before, does not mean that with 50% less alpha you still will volley it. You don't deal 6k per hit : you deal 6k per hit, average, with very high tracking.
---
So yes, the change did hit the applied DPS of HAW.
---
&gt;Clearly you don't get the joke.
---
Yeah okay, that's why you use Mittens avatar instead of someone else?
---
Sounds like the voice of experience
---
No what I made the case for is that because how shit titan tracking is the 50 % nerf practically an even bigger nerf because you will only be ever doing grazing hits. So where before you did volleys of 14K which got halved to 7 due to grazing and then again to 3k because of resists which almost killed a sabre now its 6-7 k halved to 3k due to tracking and then to 1.5k due to resists. My argument is that the way dmg is applied tracking functions as a multiplier to dmg and the halving of haw dmg on titans had way bigger implications against smaller targets.

It's gonna be awesome. It was a dearly needed feature.

Hence why I've used his face :D
---
shhh
---
That's why there are words after the ":" to differentiate.
---
Is it really supposed to be lawless? I thought it was a sandbox where players could impose their own laws. fuck the purpose
---
 of null isnt some dumb battle royal where everyone is
---
 forced to gun eaciother down for no real reason.
---
We can't all be so elite
---
&gt;CCP isn't trying to scare the care bear, they're trying to scare the cheater and purify this bot filled game. 
---
If they wanted the latter, there would be automated detection and banning.
---
I mean.... Pyfa is still superior
---
what about expensive bots like jita trader?
---
whiny carebear memes are shit
---
Yes, that's the hole point of it. It's lawless space with the best resources. Big risk, big reward. Very little risk involved. That's the entire point of security levels.
---
But that translates into more expensive PVP ships, which does affect other players.
---
When shit like this, drifters and incursion nerf happen, you're goddamn right I grab the popcorn and slide over to the forum. If you think r/eve has been a dumpster fire, you really gotta witness the glory of the official forum.
---
Or gf.
---
"In space, I can have ice cream."
---
Set it to less the one au. If anything non ratting / mining based apairs pull drones and align out. Hostile lands hit warp
---
Already being done! Just need more intrepid agents to volunteer. Also, there has been a prediction that the most diehard bot-aspirants will be returning to their ancestral homelands in highsec if this blackout becomes permanant. So do your civic duty and roll up a catalyst alt - let them find no safe haven.
---
Yeah but 2200 of them are by the same guy.
---
wait that's happening today? i thought it was next dt?
---
Wait so was I breaking the law
---
That's exactly the goal, just more spaceship violence all around.
---
Two minutes later
---
There are a lot of people who think that as long as they sell the ore, even if processed into a ship, they are making money so they can sell it at whatever price. Yes, it's dumb, but not all people are rational.
---
Additionally, don't forget that the ship market and the cost it takes to make the ship are linked but not 100% dependent. If the ship costs 100mil in minerals to make, but it's really unpopular, the price is going to tank under 100mil. Don't forget the day traders who buy off the buy order and then sell it. If the sell price is 90mil, as long as the buy price is lower than that, they're making a profit, so as an industrialist, you're also fighting against them. (Note: this is also balanced by insurance, as the price will never go below the value you get by blowing it up for insurance money, which is 100% based on mineral prices of the ship)
---
Combine it with all the info, for long-term industrialist who operate in months, they maybe made a ship at 10% profit, made hundreds of them. But then, because of a nerf or change in the meta, the price slowly slides under their profit margin. They're better off selling the ship at a cost than letting it rot. The super-rich might also have so much ore/mineral that putting it all in the market would simply crash it, so they're better off turning it into modules and ships. They can't just make the same item over and over because they would simply crash that market too.
---
Tell us more about how space elite you are.
---
IDGI either.
---
BR did jack all for CCP's bottom line
---
Correct me if Im wrong, but isn't Odin's the only one in that group with a NS static hole...
---
Watch it and move on.
---
Its 730am on the east coast In america. We are all in bed playing on reddit before we get ready for work.
---
Although in kind of want to call in and just tote around in my spaceships all day.
---
Anywhere is a good place to learn null.
---
The guys name was Mr. Burns. So they weren't yelling boo, they were cheering his name
---
Never seen a subreddit with so many "0" score text posts.
---
Hey look, it's jita!
---
If you think you might like the game and stick around. The package that gives 110 PLEX is nice. You can sell it for 400million ISK which let's you explore the game without having to worry so much about ISK per hour.
---
Are you able to buy the starter after alreadyikg buying the 15 dollar one?
---
If they do bring those observatories I would like to see a jammer that could be anchored near them (a bit like a cyno inhib).
---
Yes, it would be typical for CCP to introduce something extremely dumb like that rather than to take an opportunity to make the game a little more engaging for players.
---
[insert "eve has sound?" joke here]
---
It's the drifters he hates, he welcomes no local
---
Aideron Robotics is kinda neat. Although there are others.
---
You usually get a few systems of leeway though. It can take a few systems before:  
---
1. They notice you in local and report it on intel channels (as you said, lots of empty systems), not every system has people in it. Some people are in system but AFK in a station or ratting/mining.
---
2. People see the notification on their intel channel. They might also be AFK.
---
If people were 100% perfect all of the time, whaling would simply not be a thing because people would dock up as soon as they saw you in local. You rely on people being dumb to be able to whale effectively.
---
As if humping rocks or orbiting sites is "playing" the game.
---
That moment you realise the OP is a retard who assumes that these people wont login.. The bots do not care as the amount of isk earned is less than can be lost.... 
---
Takes only around 1 hour to regain what they lost.. So even if they die once per day, they are still in profit..
---
I for one will go on a hunting party on friday :)
---
&gt; It's summer for many
---
What does that have to do with anything?  Like EVE players go outside in the first place...
---
never have read more non sense on this sub. wait...nope, this one takes it home
---
You are thicker than a whale omelette Choridon.  Mittani is in favour of getting rid of local.  He said so last week on The Meta Show and last Saturday in the Fireside.  
---
I think perhaps the reason the coalition is the one "you've heard the most" is because it has by far the most players.  If everyone whines or does not wine equally, which is not unreasonable, more Goons will be whining than any other alliance.
---
Dscan is overrated. Best not to use it at all. Nullsec residents can feel safe in the loving arms of their alliance. Having situational awareness will only cause anxiety. Stop your fearmongering. Everything will be fine and nobody will be exploded.
---
Victorieux Luxury Yacht?
---
&gt; new Upwell structures
---
Fuck them.  Either keep it dark or add in some user/group centered command charge activated radar system.  Maybe fleet radar or similar, with a nice spiffy UI; something actual players can be engaged with.
---
Laugh in wormholes
---
Wormholer btw
---
Short, simple and funny. Good job OP.
---
What is it like being retarded?
---
and people say solo is dead.
---
Ah, you're right, cloaky camping doesn't work at all because every human out there has perfect reaction time and always pays attention to intel channels /s.
---
(IMO, a better change is to tie local appearance with gate cloak, so you can get a solid 60s of not showing up in local, or tying local to a destructible structure with no ref timers.)
---
#saved
---
When he made that promise, he was the decision maker. Then, in an effort to not have his shit punched in, he reached out and formed a conglomerate.
---
Don't think I've noticed a goon in my entire 5 years of playing. Let alone now. Look, let's be real. They're waaaay out there in their backwater NS cluster. Chances of them finding me in a random HS system is slim. What are they going to do, email me to death? :P
---
Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War III is the rts. Is the solo birds eye view just warhammer 40k?
---
I mean... Yeah lol.
---
We call our spais CEO and directors in BNB normally :)
---
Your little group wouldn't stand a chance. But I see you are on a diplo account, feel free to contact GSF diplos, I am sure we can work out the details of your surrender.
---
I'm almost positive it was being applied Friday at DT not today.
---
Did you check the forum??? It's the largest salt mine in existence.
---
The thing with Dscan is the botter can't tell if its hostile or friendly. This will have a huge impact on a bots isk/hour.
---
Yes, you can just only buy the same named ones once per account.
---
OP is primary
---
Ahhh I'm gonna start jumping between enemy systems and say 'waddup' and move on to the next just to make everyone shit their pants.
---
Why is this happening?
---
True, but if it's all you've got...
---
They are already using alpha vnis, they will use alpha myrms. They can easily use one or two alphas to watch gates.
---
Ill come back for this its a needed change.
---
Glad you agree. 
---
I don't know what the actual intentions of CCP are on why they do the Blackout, but reddit seems to think it's because bots get protected by local. And now that local is about to go people already think of software to track player movement on Gates/D-Scan. This basically forces CCPs hand even further.
---
Welcome back
---
Star pack went back to %50.
---
Not that the blackout has happened yet anyway :D
---
You thought correctly
---
Same. Gave me a giggle.
---
When real money is involved, they don't just dock up and get discouraged like typical players. They have to make a living.
---
It's pretty trivial to spin up larger bot farms since margins will be tighter.
---
That just makes it even easier to shut them down with 1 character then.
---
What forum.
---
&gt;it is not OK to change the game mechanics to force said players in a specific direction.
---
Why not?
---
All they would need to do is lower the bar for 'bot detection'. If get flagged you get a captcha.
---
Is that the thing that makes a bang noise every time you press a key?
---
Yeah. But less effort for CCP to spend a few minutes coding a thing than have thousands of tickets until EVE shuts down.
---
Aww sheet, here we go again.
---
Local doesn't enable or stop you from making your own laws in null, so nothing has changed in that regard
---
Set bot to press DSCAN every 10 &gt; 30 seconds... use random.org for his selection... Job done..
---
"solo birds eye view" wat? There's a rather sizable amount of 40k games out there, but there has never been a game genre called "solo birds eye view" in *any* franchise.
---
Why does noone remember the jumpgate mine fuckery? *sad python noises
---
random.org...
---
Price is already falling back.
---
Okay I get what you are saying, and you are right the net application of damage may well have dropped well below when factoring grazing hits, but that's viewed in a vacuum. Ultimately where a titan is able to apply a volley via HAWs to a Sabre, it will be able to apply gross damage.
---
You misunderstood my (and thread OPs) comment about it instead focusing on average damage.
---
Noone thinks so afaik, we are just making fun of all their kicking and screaming about it... you know, that massive rive of salt that has been flowing through this sub for the past couple of weeks.
---
wait... you mean instead of reeeeeing all over reddit for the past week or so, you actually took the time to work out how to use a new mechanic to your own benefit?
---
Fuck me, they're learning guys!
---
Star packs as well. Comes out to under $4 a bil if you refer a new account with a $25 star pack and sell everything. You can throw the account away. If you include Omega it's $2.20 a bil.
---
Thanks for your input, but you're talking about something else entirely lmao. Re-read the context of this discussion and try to unpick the situations where people are being literal and facetious.
---
Imagine being that salty about it...
---
And refer a new account for 350 more plex, two boosters, and an extractor.
---
Surely there are more valid targets for war than your own coalition founding members.
---
I think you've missed the point of my comment. These groups do that sort of thing to other people all the time, I'm not going to lose any sleep over the idea of less powerful groups gaining the power to do it to them back.
---
Nerfs for thee but not for me!
---
I'm going to take an educated guess and say that CCP does not have the ability to fine-tune control local chat to the level you are talking about. They probably have the ability to turn it on, off, or use delayed mode.
---
Hey mate, why won't you have fun for the duration of this change?
---
I used the word frigate analogously given contextually it is a smaller target compared to a titan, but I guess that point escaped you.
---
&gt; we are talking about sabre and due to the nerf its not insta blab rather a sabre can take a couple of hits 
---
So I ask again: what does **tracking** have to do with it? Remember you brought up tracking as the linchpin, which is why I called you an idiot.
---
yes. yes, no. you'll have to look for them, but we call 'em corps not guilds
---
The way you wrote your original comment one could argue sabres are useless with titans because they are getting insta blapped by haw which is after the essentially impossible to do unless the sabre pilot is terri bad.
---
Wait is it?
---
This week I thought it was local being a thing?
---
And the week before was the drifters?
---
And before that was being able to buy 1 million skill points?
---
I can't keep up with all this.
---
This is the exact reason I have force fields on my D scan list.
---
right, my bad. As I said, it's been years \^\^
---
That was also the case pre-nerf. You could delete every post you have made so far in this thread and still have contributed the net-same amount to this discussion.
---
&gt;However: this also means that people entering null from wormholes would remain hidden, until they dock or move through a gate.    
---
YES PLEASE
---
A lot of industry nerds are actually really dumb and think their materials are free because they mined it themselves.
---
Don't you want big coalitions to break up and shake up nullsec? Both co2 and test members agree we had a fun war up until judgement day.
---
Flipped film facefucking
---
just put the salt on a scale, every kilo is one play being mad
---
You should right now, its fantastic to read.
---
he'll make a gudpost when your space clan stops being has-beens.
---
There hasn't been a "massive river of salt" flowing through this sub.
---
it can be, its why hole control is so important. If you lose the ability to roll, IE if a substantial hostile bomber fleet makes it inside and end up securing an entry for a rolling ship, you can get really fucked really fast. If hostiles get hole control, they can fully prevent any reinforcements from coming in, and prevent resupplies, basically turning it into a seige.
---
It's a bit of a double edged sword like that.
---
I don't know too much about these bot programs, but can they re ship for you? Like if you get blown up, do they go back to station, get another ship, and start all over again? Because if not I would imagine that getting killed cost them more than just a single ship.
---
"AAARRRRMOOORRRR HAAAACCSSS"
---
I want them back too
---
It's fun for about a whole minute.
---
i had to use dscan to read that, 10/10
---
I'm picturing someone walking though a bad part of town at night, listening to the D-Scan noise through their headphones for comfort.
---
ching chong you are wrong
---
The one thing is that a gate watching bot has no way to know if or when you have left the system. You can watch all the gates, but if they don't see an exit how long will they assume that person is in local? Forever?
---
Whitelist all VNIs :\^)  no but seriously they already know which characters are "friendly" in the local list, it shouldn't be too difficult to do something similar with d-scan for them
---
i got myself a rook
---
&gt; dependable torpedo drivers
---
I've never heard masturbation called *that* before.
---
As long as they don't bring back the bong sound when you kill each rat I'm happy.
---
damn dude, thats some money you gonna be making
---
Don't knock it till you try it.
---
You stopped buying PLEX, so literally no real money loss in the first place for CCP. And the PLEX market ingame will tank it. So nothing of value was lost. Also a lot of people that actually pay money to CCP have resubbed already ...
---
CCP.         
---
They called them Drifters.
---
a covert tengu is about as much as a curse/huginn/rook/lach hull, you pay like 30~60m per mod and 200 for the hull
---
Honestly the game is more fun with music off and all the other sounds up. Add in a slightly larger than microdose microdose of your preferred psychedelic and you can really tune into space adventures.
---
&gt; a lazer emitter scanning a swarm of flies or something crazy.
---
To be totally honest, I kinda want to see someone set up a gallon jar with an art heist movie laser array and a bunch of flies.
---
I don't know why everyone got it in their head that a combat Recon is a better solo hunting ship than actual covert Ops Cruiser. Guess what, you are dscan immune if you are cloaked!
---
Those are a thing on Serenity, I wouldn't be surprised if some have made their way to TQ.
---
Nullsec blackout will equal less botters. I don’t know how many less, but it’s less. Can we agree on that?
---
If he could not uphold that promise he should not have made it end of story. 
---
Oh and hes still directly responsible for it if he transferred ownership to another entity and the other entity then changed it.
---
I did, but now I kind of wish I had bought more of them.
---
Yikes @ you.
---
I too played for a few hours back in 2015. A few days actually. 
---
Gave it another shot and I am having much more fun this time around.
---
Same back at you ?
---
OMG this is great !! GET ON THE HYPE TRAIN BOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
---
The existence of this tool is irrelevant to botting because bots could leave sites by using dscan alone, no tool needed.
---
Great for you, not everyone enjoy running 3+ accounts.
---
Dude join and make what u want. U can pvp pve, mine, trade, fly around, explore(ation) - good money and easy with blackout in null soon. 
---
Then u can build ur own ships and stuff
---
Yes come back! There's always a place for new bros in alliances.
---
I agree watcching 1k titans in super tidi is way better then watching good fights.
---
Should only bong if there's something new to see.
---
I'm not 100% sure I understand what you're going for, but cyno's in WH space doesn't really make much sense. Jumps don't use gates/holes, they just travel a straight line from A-B based on lightyear distance.
---
We don't know where wormhole space is even physically located. It's likely not even in the same galaxy. Any two systems may also not be in the same galaxy as one another.
---
Also, if you can cyno INTO a hole, whats to stop you from cynoing OUT of one? You'd be giving people the power to blops you with literally zero risk. They could just roll their null static until its in your space, send a single cov-ops frigate to find a target, light a cyno and boom. One blackops BS drops 80 stealth bombers in your lap.
---
I don't think the server crashes that often.
---
Btw. Does the abyss run on the same node as the system the pilot entered it from?
---
&gt; e forum
---
I thought this was the forum...
---
You can stay Alpha for VNI/Gila/Myrm/Domi. Did I miss a botting ship in that list ?
---
No. :c
---
Sorry, had to. Being for the state and all that stuff.
---
I'm not sure what it *should* sound like, but somehow it's always bugged me a little that it sounds like a sonar ping.
---
The local list is easy though as standings shows up with the players name. With dscan you don't know who is piloting the ship or if there is even a pilot in the ship. You can easily just leave abandoned t1 frigs/cruisers around in system and the bots won't even know if its piloted or not.
---
Yet you move entire regions to escape real combat:)
---
Yes, but it actually has a cloak. These dscan memes are getting silly. If you want d-scan immune neuts, get a legion or a pilgrim. Cloaks are strictly better than d-scan immunity in null.
---
Since you say there is a massive river of salt about this, surely you can provide at least 10 links to back this up? Surely you arnt drinking the koolaid and you are telling the truth?
---
Assuming it's legit, most likely because of us. We suck a *lot* of crok. So much so that it becomes profitable to commit mass insurance fraud.
---
So finally Delve is becoming "a dark, harsh place" again? Who would have thought CCP would be true to the core principles of the game after the last 3 years of maximized afk-PvE?
---
But null is the epic endgame of eve? \*join horde/karma/whatever post\*
---
My assumption about the warfare to be waged is that it will be more economic. In that sense yes, there has been market changes. But that could however just be speculation due to coming hostilies.
---
It's 1.5 bil isk or 14 days of training time to get 750k SP.
---
Panfraternity not to worry spy, we have lot of spy too.
---
The only thing that matters, is if botting continues to be worthwhile. And trolling bots with leaving t1 frigates behind isn't going to be enough.
---
Like I mentioned in my other comments, the only botters who I expect will have issues with the blackout are the extremely basic bots. They will either quit or upgrade to a paid bot script which uses more advanced logic/scouts to handle things.
---
I really think people are overestimating how effective this is going to be to block bots. Botting is purely driven by making isk so unless it stops being profitable it isn't going to stop.
---
If you're new and low SP, inform yourself which ships you want to fly. Then inform yourself which pirate factions drop loot that fits your prefered shiptype (shield/armor and which weapons mainly). Then look in which spaces those pirates operate. Then search for Corps in that region and ask them which doctrines they fly. If they fly doctrines similar to your prefered shiptype, you got a match. 
---
This way you can use the loot you get from Mission running yourself until you can equip T2 Modules and Weapons. You might also benefit from skills trained for Doctrines in other areas of the game like Mission running.
---
......umm. Never said the game was called “solo birds eye view”. I said there is a solo as in a solo player game with a single character. Then birds eye view as in the perspective the game is played in. Hence “solo birds eye view” warhammer 40k dawn of war. 
---
Don’t see how you got lost after we made it clear on the first comment.
---
You can, but omega will give better profit
---
Well? Just reprogramm the "tools" that were running on the Alts that were sitting on this gates anyway to feed local channel and intel channel data to that tool. Make it readout Charnames from ship in overview instead of readout from local channel ... /s (very bitter /s)
---
I think you're salty. You've played Eve for so long and don't even understand what's going on. Pitiful.
---
The corp I've been working with uses their own minerals and just charges cost+10% to alliance members because of the location. Seems easy for them to make some isk and me to avoid hauling ships/fits.
---
Everyone does. At least everyone who played before citadels.
---
Structures that shows friendly only in local would be nice.
---
so why then is everyone rejoicing about bots beeing eff'd in less than 24 hours when they already can escape using d-scan?
---
Don't judge the game by what this subreddit says. Get back in game, do some stuff, talk to some people, get in a Corp that's like-minded and enjoy the game. It's fun.
---
Players: "Yo CCP, is this a bug or a feature?"
---
CCP: "Um...do you like...it?
---
I'm gonna have to create more reddit alts to give you more upvotes.
---
A thread did actually pop up here shortly after the initial announcement, asking about how viable they are for ratting... the only 2 things I remember from that was the rook is semi-viable and that "the hunter will still see the wrecks on scan". 
---
I can't imagine there will be that many out there after local goes down (the ratting variety anyway).
---
You will use this in any space if you’ve ever flown dangerous.
---
a recon can also cloak, just not in warp
---
you have a t3 or covert recon (like a falcon) or even a bomber as scout, and the Recons as the main force who can sit cloaked on the sun and wait for its move
---
Pointing out cloaking is not remotely OP just cause someone doesn't like it.
---
It got gooned
---
I would, try the new player experience and the starter missions. If you get the itch to keep playing look at joining eve university they will teach you basic game mechanics and anything else you take interest in! PvP, PvE, industry and exploration just to name a few.
---
WHers gonna have a field day
---
People are assuming that because other players will no longer show up in local VISUALLY that the bot won't be able to tell a neutral is in system. However we don't know this for sure, as bots hook into and directly access the memory used by the Eve client. There may be data in memory would tell a bot who is in system, but that doesn't show up visually on screen, i.e. you still connect to the chat server when switching systems and while visually the channel members list doesn't show on screen, the member list may be stored in client memory and therefore still be accessible to the bot.

WTF I HATE CCP NOW.
---
No really, way into local deletion, this just show they still can’t help not fucking things up.
---
They can take two volleys if your first doesn't do that job. Reference: me. Grazed three different ones down to 10-40 % hull each one one volley. So with heated guns, that sabre lasts 3 seconds.
---
It's never too late to join. I fly mostly frigates, some of the smallest ships in game, and I do just fine. In decent sized packs, you can kill anything.
---
Honestly fueling is optional, how many people will check?
---
Really, also when you put the 2 Bil for each account to PLEX into calculation? Thats 35 VNI hours overhead just for subbing ?
---
I can already see the Capsule swarms in tether range. Guessing CCP'd rather save themselves the bandwith of thousands of inactive clients.
---
Thanks goons

yes. Lach and a arazu are going to be amazing for this

---
You know what eve needs more of? Structures with damage caps and tz tanking....
---
Oh wait. Fuuuuuck no.
---
But why use recons as a main force in first place? They're less tanky than t3cs, they do less dps, fitting a cloak compromises their lock time, and in the case of curses, all of your dps dies to smartbombs. 
---
Oh yeah, and unlike T3Cs, you can't even take cov ops bridges, so you have to pass through gates and ruin the surprise factor. 
---
 Yall trying to re-invent the wheel. Why sit cloaked on the sun when you can sit cloaked on a sun in the next region and get bridged right onto the target?
---
Yeah... well the results would disagree...
---
For that though, I blame the question phrasing.

yay more powercreep

huh, that's kinda neat

99.9% of killmarks are participation trophies. If you want to change it, change kill marks to only being from solo kills.

---
Now it's only for people too poor to afford titans
---
Darn shame you're blacklisted.. darn shame.

I suppose you only need to get it passed the armor timer to knock any Service Modules out, but yeah I totally agree Upwell Structures need some change. But since CCP already announced the Observatories I'm just brainstorming what role they will fill in. :-)
---
as is my PP
---
I don't know how anyone can answer no. Wormhole has opt-in local, null is about to have it. I would love to know the difference
---
Wait did progod take fleet somewhere again?
---
Same, they can do what they want, it won't impact me in the slightest.
---
and we love you &lt;3
---
These also need to be anchorable next to a Keepstar, because reasons.
---
No, we will just third party everything and keep CCP devs lazy. Who cares about ingame features. It may as well be matrix text as long as there's an outside tool that does the job.
---
If ccp is so locked on damage caps it should be a single attack for structures like observatories. Make it like a 40 min base time vulnerable in any tz. If you can't formup in that time you don't need the free Intel I'm assuming they will give. Or make it where it must be actively named (a local chat dscan tool)
---
Plot twist: you don't have any gates
---
It's probably a mixture of things. Lower demand from the recent sale, higher supply from the recent sale, the summer, uncertainty for the blackout, etc. etc.
---
"Congrats you're hired" - ccp2019

Used to name all my ships Ibis for this very reason.

AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

\*GASP\*
---
....you know that this is sandbox? that's one of the concepts about a sandbox. it's like people playing battle royale and then complaining about it depending on loot RNG...maybe don't play a battle royale then?
---
LMA...o... no wait I mean yeah, totally.
---
nothing new either. has been like this for 6+ years
---
I'd like to gain a plex for every hour logged in (please no don't do this!) 
---
Something for sure is it would bring the plex price down. And only earning these points while docked and uncloaked, this may increase demand more so for dscan immune ships, marginally. It would somewhat encourage people to roam and actually do something, and which would help alongside the blackout.
---
It costs nothing to not be a dick to someone asking a simple question.
---
Easy answer done in other MMOs...daily quests. They would need to be pretty varied in contentnhowever.
---
There are only 6 regions with full super umbrellas imo
---
First of all, thank you for taking the time to respond.
---
&gt;Yup, this is how we do it, unless new commands are issued there's no traffic between server and clients regarding a ships position. This comes with it's own issues but keeps the requirements for traffic much lower.
---
How is damage synced then? When you fire a weapon, the game must tell whether or not you hit, how much damage you dealt, then update the state of both your target and your client with that information. Is that also done without transmitting data? If so, how?
---
&gt;Exactly. Dscan is iterating through every ball (celestial, ship, drone, structure etc) in the systems simulation, and filtering out anything that is further than your max dscan range. It has next to nothing to do with grids.
---
This sounds like what I described elsewhere...an algorithm that was designed when it wasn't expected to be used en masse, or when requirements were expected to be lower. And there hasn't been much reason to change it with higher priority issues and features.
---
But I stand corrected. If you use a loop on every system object *then* it creates server lag. But if you were using a data structure that was mapped by known distances you wouldn't even need to check objects outside the dscan range; the loop would stop the moment the n objects were checked.
---
&gt;None of this is to say that it couldn't be done differently given infinite time and manpower, but they way you're saying it works is not true.
---
Fair enough. Development always has priorities, and I waited years for a toggle to change the zoom direction. And you still can't change characters without closing the client.
---
Neither of these things are technical limitations, they're development ones. Sometimes they are easy (reversing a mouse scroll) but low priority, sometimes they are hard (changing characters) due to legacy code design (my understanding is you'd have to rewrite a ton of character code).
---
But if you really wanted to change how dscan works to make it avoid lagging the servers for some gameplay reason, I'm 100% confident you could do so. Considering how many players complained about switching it from a click to a shortcut key I too probably wouldn't bother changing it =).
---
When you're running them 23/7, yes its worth it
---
It was a drinking roam I forgot to screenshot haha
---
A spai is someone who gets caught 🤘
---
Oh yes, that's the reason I can at least sit in almost all hulls. I never not check, and if FF is up but there's a super I also try some common passwords. So far no such luck, but I have scored shitloads of subcaps and probably tens of billions in moon goo back when those were mined with POSes.
---
Place drones in pos as well
---
I haven't seen my parents since i joined.
---
I hope they are still alive ...
---
That's fine, but then they shouldn't cry about good fights or claim this change is increasing pvp fights. That's ignorant at best or dishonest at worst.
---
Pretty sure bots salvage too
---
so TEST prety much
---
Talking in Stations vlog on youtube is reasonably balanced
---
[stop it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vifYelSTlMo
---
)
---
Nullsec after this change is more dangerous than wormhole space so the whole balance of danger is out the window.
---
tbh, make them analogs of old station services in terms of vulnerability/effort needed to take out.
---
Probably need to be relatively cheap to account for that, but hey.
---
Thanks querns &lt;3
---
But am i allowed to make iskies with my tanny ?
---
No, your execution is at dawn
---
&gt; Sadly, you also can't just increase the "difficulty" to farm resources,
---
Why not? Remove all current anoms and make them clones of incursion sites. Each constellation spawns a "set" of sites of the proper fleet size spread, and tell you which system the next site is after completing the current one and you have to gate to it.
---
That's going to be pretty tricky to write bot programs for.
---
For this alone you shall be shunned!
---
The new bug will be that instead of a blackout null systems will randomly have normal local back.
---
The game really isn't designed in such a way that it would ever really not have a place for new players.
---
God save the president.
---
Oh, ya’ll just don’t know what you’re missing.   ^.-
---
We know, we simply judge from our clogged arteries and go-carts.
---
In null, Noone can hear you REEEEEEE
---
I didn't say that.  Eve is an exciting game to play and I have been in some big fights.  They are always more interesting to experience than to watch.  It just doesn't make for great videos like some other games.
---
too desperate for relevancy
---
Most of null is empty anyway. Who cares?
---
I mean, CCP could also "fix" that by nerfing raw bounties, then having the ESS give LP rather than isk, which both reduces the ratting isk faucet and adds a sink. But that's too much work.
---
But they were yelling boo. And burns asked if they were yelling boo-urns. How is boo-urns a cheer?
---
no less than a 50/50 logi to dps ratio
---
Pubbies
---
This lol
---
Lmao I'm sorry to hear that.. you're missing out on 60-75% of new Eden though by limiting yourself to high sec.
---
There are ways to travel safely in low security systems. They just take some time and practice to learn
---
Thanks man! Gods I cant wait to get to that level of business, atm i just started mining and subsequently producing missiles. I'm probably gonna fly to an area with high pop and make a base just outside of it, going there with shipments through cloaked industrial ship or fighter with cargo hold. I'm gonna write down what you did too, so I can have a varied ideal.
---
Thanks!
---
Just remember that finding a good corp can take time :)
---
Once you find the right one tho, you’ll all be best mates for life.
---
If you can't find ten post from goons bitching about the blackout (amongst many other krabs) from the past three days you are either blind or seriously delusional. 
---
And I don't feel like wasting my time searching them to please your self entitled ass, so do with that what you want.
---
What fucking amateur solo camps
---
2 dps is more than enough when the enemy has no cap
---
Well, no it's not since natural shield regen would be enough then, but the general point is correct, yes.
---
Think they did this at some point, kill 10 rats go mine some stuff etc.
---
Yeah its slow, but I'd argue the titans jumping in and doomsday weaponing the dreadnought was pretty awesome.
---
I prefer the way albiononline does it with "seasons"...rewards for achieving a certain quantity of VARIED tasks...and the  unlocking a chest or box. Daily rewards in eve dont work well.
---
Probably the best time to join, if I'm being honest.  It looks like CCP are shaking the game up in some big ways. Love or hate the changes, I don't think anyone will deny that were in an exciting time.
---
I'll take "Cap stable 10k m/s Punishers pointed in a random direction" for 1000 Alex.
---
Or fit a cov ops cyno :(
---
O.o...
---
"Being a dick" was never the intention when I wrote that! '-'
---
"Emphatic" for sure, but if you and others managed to fish agressive out of that, I can only lament.
---
&gt;No, I can't back up my statement.
---
What's wrong with that? I for one see this as a great side effect of this change. Its a much needed adjustment to the strategic balance.
---
The more people finally accept they need to choose a side with one of the power blocks, the sooner balance can be restored to nullsec
---
Never not post your killmail in Jita local and beg for SRP. You'd be surprised at the generosity of the scum that resides there..
---
You're the one with the salt claim, so you're the one required to prove it, that's how these things work. But now that you admit you can't back up your claim, you are admitting to drinking the "hurrdurr gewnies r so fukd during blackout" koolaid, thanks for playing.
---
Friend
---
If you're looking for proof, check the official eve forums. Youll fit right in
---
Like why?         
---
All the nerfs CCP did to ganking lead only to people getting into bigger and bigger groups - allowing them to gank cheaper and bigger targets.               
---
A-Typed arks, and ore bulk anshars die now due to this. Something that was earlier assumed not possible.

It's nearly as if d-scan presets that show the control towers do not exist...

Add force fields to d-scan.

I've hunted ratting vnis in a vni before.  It works pretty well until you get one then they run again.

The blue doughnut is a term that describes how many neighboring coalitions are allied or have non-invasion pacts with each other, creating a ring around most of the map, as seen [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c0qjpw/updated_coalition_sov_map_14062019/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
---
It looks like big part of the stuff you suggested is about making all things better ... 
---
For example fighters ehp boost is good for ratting, for PVP perspective they can die.      
---
Hell make fighter EHP 50% of the current one, reduce materials and size by 50%.           
---
More fighters dying is more engaging and fun than less stuff dying.      
---
Fighter battles will get new meaning.
---
Yes sweety, you are correct and totally not reading whatever you want to feel like you won an argument on the internet. Well done buddy, keep being this special.
---
This is sad, because it is a serious possibility! --"
---
Learn to read and then come back to play buddy.
---
But good try, you totally not look retarded.
---
What you really said:
---
&gt;I can't back up what I said, so I am going to try to use insults to change directions.
---
Diminishing returns on fax reps stacked over a certain #, CCP released some good graphs
---
They can.  Most probably don't because there isn't much reason to.  at most you lose a few hours of income which isn't that bad.  at worst, if there is a bug that caused you to die the first time, you don't want to continue running that program and feeding to rats.
---
Uhmm... That is true, although this could be a easy way to dick some new guys to the "D-Scan" game lol
---
Albeit I believe that would be a bit of an expensive way to make just a short prank.
---
Because you can jump in to system ( no one can see you ) in your combat recon.         
---
Warp directly to anom and due to fact that they are not visible on dscan there is no way player or bot will react.             
---
You can also use a bomber ... that can warp cloacked and have no delay after dropping cloack and can point you instantly.
---
Thanks for proving you can't back up your statements so you are switching to personal insults.
---
if you can figure it out, a bot can figure it out.  At some point it becomes too tedious.  but then again, if it is too tedious, you have basically ruined the gameplay for actual players as well.
---
Trying to change the meaning of other people's words to fit your argument doesn't make you right, it just makes you look like an idiot.
---
What I said is that the posts of people crying about the blackout are right there for everyone to see, and that I don't feel like wasting my time spoonfeeding retards like you that wouldn't change their minds even if I did.
---
Is that more clear buddy? Or you need me to draw you a picture?
---
You legitimately typed your first sentence and don't see the irony of it?
---
Yes, totally what I did.
---
Damn! You won two internet arguments in a day! You are on fire today!
---
Bots are not effective in fleet fights, or reacting to a gatecamp, which is why taking gates is made part of the PvE process.
---
Yeah Hilmar needs a job too you know
---
Again, changing things in your mind don't make them real mate.
---
There is a great counter. T2 mining drones.
---
Yes they can. They are very intelligent. 
---
The most intelligent bot I have seen so far is not doing Anom's, but Abyss sites.
---
Don't forget the one thing all nullblocs fear the most:
---
Losing a ship
---
&gt;There is so much salt!  
---
Dude asks where.
---
&gt;You can't make me back up mouth.  
---
Dude points out you may be a bitch.
---
&gt;Wall of text, still not backing up mouth. Still not pointing out where the 500 people posting salt are.
---
Are you misunderstanding me on purpose? My point is that cloaky camping as a mechanic would be virtually unaffected by the changes proposed in the comment I was replying to, because cloaky campers would still show up in local as long as they are logged in, just as they do now, I don't know how to simplify this statement any further.
---
Yes but There is nothing wrong with that in my mind. I'd like to see less independent alliances and corps in nullsec, they should choose a side.
---
Whatever you do don't stay in hisec this time.  Once you get comfortable head to faction warfare space, nullsec, or wormhole space.  OR base yourself out of hisec but spend time in the aforementioned areas.  Mining in hisec or running missions in hisec is cancer.
---
I found a hel floating inside the shields f a frat POS that was not gunned. Tried every common password, even looked up quite a few... No luck though.
---
Protip. The best Value per dollar is the second highest one. I want to say its the star pack.
---
Ok buddy, that's totally what happened. Have a good day sweety, I hope your self constructed reality keeps you warm and fuzzy today.

Honestly, the gane is free so what do you have to lose by trying besides a bit of time which you're obviously OK with given the question. Join Test or Horde or another of the new pilot friendly groups and shoot stuff.
---
Smh it's like the krabs forgot cloaky shops exist
---
&gt;I want to have the last word because that's all I have left in life. I'll keep doing this until you go away so that I can pretend I win the internet.

---
i could program a bot to do fleet fights or react to a gatecamp.  there just isn't much reason to.  you are right that it would be complicated though.  At some point though, the work outweighs the reward.  If they made dramatic changes to the anoms, then you'd probably see more bots in abyssal or incursions (or exploration or mining, etc.).  They would gravitate to whatever is the best bang for the buck.
---
:ok_hand:
---
(I'm glad you are at least enjoying this excersise of imagination, but please try not to masturbate to your comment's history, that would be awkward)
---
Yeah, even if you don't use some crazy random generator like a wall of lava lamps. Just because "normal" random numbers are technically deterministic doesn't mean any reasonably amount of computing power from a small company in Iceland against a sample of a few thousand users performing an action less than once per 5 seconds can ever be expected to identify a single one.
---
That's overkill

Me when I hear CCP is removing local:

"Ah, I can't fly T3Cs and recon ships yet" :(

If I want to transfer some characters between accounts I own with PLEX, do they still require a forum post and to be in an NPC corp during the ticket process?

Yes.

Yeah, it was like one of those TV episodes where you believe you're in Heaven until a single detail reveals that it was Hell all along.

even if CCP push Observatories this way, don't forget how they turn everything to shit, calling it now - if Observatories become a thing they will operate on ACLs and local will only be visible for the ones on that ACL, while hostiles will be flying blind...

---
Sure thing, but Abyssals/exploration is not as scalable as ratting, and programming a bot to solve the hacking mini-game would also require a lot more complexity. More importantly, making "new ratting" a fleet activity that requires frequent gate jumps adds "content" and a way for CCP to tweak null player income without buffing botting too much.
---
&gt;  fleet fights would be easy as shit. assuming you had an FC that was inputing commands and not using voice chat.
---
Sure, but that still requires a human FC as I'm fairly certain creating a bot FC is not an easy task.
---
You are a special kind of stupid.
---
If this were true you'd be seeing loads of hacks involving people ignoring cloaks and finding you anyway.
---
Most / pretty much all (good) online multiplayer games go with the assumption that clients can't be fully trusted and supply information only as needed. Information about other players in the same system, what ship they're in and where they are isn't going to be provided to any client unless it becomes relevant.
---
I pity the poor forum mods...
---
That's a problem with the game design then.  You shouldn't put things in that are so tedious that players would rather not interact with that aspect
---
FAKE CHINESE VIDEO
---
Have you noticed that other MMOs have been moving away from those as they just don't work? People just log in, do their dailies and log off without really interacting with anyone as they feel like they're forced to do so to stay competitive and up to date with their gear.
---
Hm, hope you didnt add some other code to spy on peoples structures now.
---
Considering the many tools nowadays that make fitting and reshipping easier, i do think bots will probably be able to reship. One can easily make a rudimentary autohotkey script to do a few UI interactions to reship; it's only a few clicks. Any custom, more complicated botting program wouldn't have an issue with that since they already need to be reading the screen for various information so there's probably a way for them to figure out "oh, i'm now docked in a capsule".
---
But hey, a lot of botters are probably using very simple programs that they didn't make themselves so it should at least disrupt them for some time.
---
that's a good thing? all that time wasted with NPC interaction is time that is not used on player interaction. how can this be good?!
---
Yup. Seems I'm getting a lot off down votes for stating my current view on it.
---
You are starting to get lazy, c'mon, keep it up.

Insta Loot scoopers all over jita comes to mind

The Macha NOC you suggest has a logical error. If someone enters through a gate but leaves through a WH, would they remain in local indefinitely? If not, then there must be a mechanism to reveal who transits WHs.
---
Ye sir I just left it in my other pair o trousers
---
But your salty about capitals...
---
I would recommend watching some guides to understand the game mechanics. The game is still hard , but the agency is a good map for activities ( the game shows you what can you do ). As told - game have a lot to offer, but you have to spend some time in it to understand what is more preferable for you, what you enjoy the most, it’s not like a RPG where you are guided through the game, you build your own gameplay. I also rejoined few weeks ago and guides helped me to see ways of playing this game, now i want to invest time and have fun in it

People gonna be so pissed when they find out this is temporary, and will result in a 1 minute local blackout for people entering a new system by the time it is done. 
---
Maybe I'm wrong, but that's the impression I get.
---
What are the weird bubble thingeys near and around player structures and what they do besides block targeting?
---
gotta go fast
---
&gt; programming a bot to solve the hacking mini-game would also require a lot more complexity. 
---
that has been done a while ago.  Exploration bots are a thing.  and Abyssals are also botted now.  Exploration, however, isn't as endless as anom ratting and abyssal is a bit more tricky and not nearly as lucrative.  
---
and yea, a bot FC would be difficult.  Although .... would still be better than 90% of the current FCs (and would probably yell less).
---
you are competitive with players that play for over a decade within a few hours. so i'd say yes yes yes
---
Then you kill that botting VNI. And next one appears hour after. No big loss for already established bot networks.
---
Unlike most people believe all of you would need to basically live there to make any significant effect on botting. It’s not that visiting null-sec once a week and spend there an hour will yield any result.
---
Can confirm. Once (years ago in hisec) knew of a bot observed being blown up, docking, then undocking in a new ship. Must've been about 10 killmails before the owner switched it off
---
So you're saying a 50% decrease in DPS actually decreased the DPS? What a shocker!
---
you don't spend much time on the new category? mods have been pretty active with removing low effort cryposts
---
Do you know how many people are planning to hunt in nullsec? Specifically for botters?  Literally everyone.
---
 definitely. But lets be real people barely honor pvp :/
---
We're all commissars now.

Citadels are where it's at, use a holding corp if you don't want to get wardecced.

I don't see an opacity setting anywhere. (I may be bad...)

But this is more complaining about trash default settings in the game and lack of customization like saving default better ones.

But hey we can at least thumbs up or down if we enjoyed playing EVE Online today...Like we're on Twatter or something.

like, if you relied solely on local for your safety before, you are a shit player. i can't argue anymore...so much entitlement from the pve'rs

That's what people love to think, but is it the true solution for botters? I doubt it is...
---
First of all, we all know that this is a test, maybe for some sov changes (for example use local as tactical objective for sov war, something like ihubs, which honestly are the only sov stuff that matters)
---
If this "blackout" will last too long CCP income will suffer too much, honestly I don't care if someone have resubbed for this event but it's crystal clear to everyone that there's much more people angry for this move, people that will not even log or undock without local, and if this blackout will be too long those guys will not resub again.
---
We'll see on Eve-offline.net how many people will log.
---
This blackout will only cause a small break on botters activity, which will return the same when local will return.
---
Less bots means less subs or at least less chars which means less money for CCP.
---
Ask yourself why CCP don't want to introduce some serious tracking on player activity to track bots?
---
For example identify players workstation using several hardware data (something like windows activation process), so if you're banned for botting you can't even open a new account, or at least you must change you pc for that.
---
I know, but as of right now, I dont have the skills, ships, funding to even attempt it right now.
---
If there's one thing EVE players are known for, it's taking simple mechanics that at the surface level can't be abused, and completely abusing the absolute fuck out of them.
---
Instead of a free shit incentive to get people in the game, they should focus on keeping people in the game because it's fun.
---
Sure love hunters getting free Intel, I could have swore hunters were complaining about free Intel, but they would never by hypocrites.
---
It took three days.
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/upwell-2.0-structures-changes-coming-on-february-13th
---
So they shoot the shield on day 1; 12 hours later there the armor timer (+/- 2h) and then if it's a least 24h hours before the final timer, they can do the hull timer the day after
---
The POS force fields? They only let you in if you know the password and if you’re inside nothing outside can hurt you
---
you have all windows unpinned?
---
&gt; Fweddit formed some close friends 
---
ay lmao
---
Can we do dusk?  Have another appointment at dann.
---
Rip.
---
bok bok btw
---
How do you dscan?
---
In wormholes that is possible as long as the attackers time it correctly
---
'some'
---
This is THE forum.
---
'some' ok lol
---
It’s not the same in nullsec?
---
Nope they're all unpinned this is just maximum transparency being a default setting that CCP gives everyone in potato mode.
---
Instead of running like 5-7 dominixes I have been teaching myself how to run Abyssals. Really liking them so far. 
---
Lastnight I even took the pvp gate in my 3.3bil Gila and pooped my pants. Nobody showed up in the arena tho, so 20mil extra.
---
I hope they make more ships and equipment available only via similar instanced pve shit.
---
&gt; I imagine it's not terribly difficult to spam D-scan and use that instead for a botter.
---
This is a huge change in behavior pattern for the bots, though. Not that it is a difficult thing to have a bot do, but suddenly a VNI bot goes from only need like 10 inputs an hour to hundreds of inputs an hour. This makes it much easier for automated bot detection to pick up on patterns and flag a player as a suspected bot.
---
yep cleaning a system in wspace is fast :D
---
So correct me if I'm wrong, plex goes to high grr ccp make it cheaper,  they run a bunch of sales plex becomes cheaper now grr market traders making my plex worth less?
---
well, you can read it as you want...
---
Eve is like real live, it's never black and white but always gray. if two entities equal size go to war, it's usually both sides poking in advance
---
Terrible implementation of this idea. Should require something that takes at least 30 minutes, then one hour, and so on.
---
The thing about a punch in the gut is that it hurts for a little bit, but then it goes away.
---
Just like this'll do with bots.
---
I love POSes because they kill players without any intervention, you just need to anchor boobles so that they pull ships right under the guns and pos scramblers. You also can drop a tractor to loot their wrecks automatically - beat afk ratting ever
---
 Adapt or die!
---
grrr PLEX
---
"How to increase fights around nullsec?"  
---
"let's make a player owned structure that can automatically send intel about invading force with no effort, and discourage fights. Make them anchorable near all the 20000+1 structure in the system, and make them a pain to be killed"  
---
Genious
---
I mean it is marketed as an "event".
---
Permanent changes are not usually events. While I'm in two minds about the whole "no local and can't scan drifters and they will randomly appear to fuck you up" thing, I feel people are overreacting with all this "I bought 273783 Plex to congratulate CCP".
---
Surely you'd wait and see how it plays out? If it lasts for months you can give CCP your undying loyalty and all your money, if it lasts a week and all the "hunters" end up feeding kills to supers and drifters, you might be less impressed.
---
welcome to r/eve
---
No forum post, but they do need to be on an NPC corp.
---
Which incursion nurf?
---
There are plenty of guides out there, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_2y9y8xPuAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2y9y8xPuAM) has some good tutorials for the overview, piloting, and the basics.
---
After that try Suitonia's "eve is easy" series to learn how to kill stuff.
---
man, keep it simple:
---
Eve is made that new players ALWAYS have a good place
---
Wasn't "Ichoseyou" guys who made a post about it a few years back saying they were a small group of people actually manipulating the plex market ?
---
Always fun to see the newest tinfoil theory on PLEX.
---
With the amount of " just subbed my 4 accounts" post on here I would expect plex to tread upwards.
---
Is it particularly hard to get the larger citadels into certain class WH because of mass limitations?
---
Hmm just bind the randomizer to your PC clock. As long as you dont have a Farm of identical PCs the frequency should be different.
---
Thanks very much :)
---
My reference was mostly to Rorqs having to de-cycle. 
---
I'm not sure what else you're going on about. You can pretty much get a warp in on almost any ship on grid once you've gotten on grid with them once. 
---
Keep trying to argue your point, but I've killed enough shit to know it's not nearly as hard as you're trying to make it seem. It is kind of funny in a way, because first there was the thrashing about and screeching about how unfair it was and CCP was making it EZ mode for hunters now etc. Now all you hear is "It won't matter. Getting kills won't be as easy as everyone thinks".  The flip-flopping of reactions is just too funny. 
---
I'm done with this conversation though. You can keep arguing with yourself if you want. I'm gonna go out and shoot some shit when the blackout gets here. See you tomorrow
---
Haha well, simple isn't the EVE way
---
They're dropping the plex market so people with a fear of the blackout deflation will dump their plex cheaply. Don't fall victim, keep the money out of the hands of the elite!
---
So elegant &amp; still funny, it actually makes you wonder why someone didn't think sooner of this joke.
---
So mittens supporting it is complaining about it? What a strange world you live in
---

---
Glad I've been buying not selling, the last few days.
---
I don’t have a guide, but, you should definitely check out the Sisters of Eve (SoE) Epic Ark. It’s a series of missions that can get you started.
---
For a week or two yeah. Is it worth losing excavators? (IMHO yes the market is saturated with them right now and I'm not selling until they are at least 800 mil a pop again)  if I was a miner I would want the safety the rorq offers in its absolutely silly tank to survive until the supers and titans cyno in. I would never step foot in ganker food aka a barge/exhumer. If it was my rorq I'd be using t2 drones
---
Many have lost sight of the fact this is still an event, and not a permanent change yet™
---
Sounds like it's going to work like it does in J space.
---
Not entirely, brawls still happen, it's certainly not the busiest it's ever been, but it's not "dead"
---
This is a copy / pasted message, but fell free to answer it if you have any questions.
---
First of all, take the time to do the career agent missions. It will show you many things in the game (exploration, mining, industry, hauling, etc).
---
Then, well Eve is a sandbox, so you will need to figure out what you want to do. As a new player, you are not strictly limited, but what ever you do, Eve can be dull and boring, mechanics are complex at first because of the amount of informations you need to learn but once you understand them it's generally a lot easier. What ever you want to do, try to have fun or enjoy the complex interactions mechanics are creating, so basically don't grind isk for the sake of grinding isk.
---
- Want to explore the stars alone ? Buy an exploration frigate, a cloaking device and go around the stars looking for data and relic sties. Maybe join a wormhole corp and enjoy space where frontiers change everyday, and need scanning on a daily basis. There are some newbie friendly wormhole corps that can teach you the way of Bob.
---
- Want to join one of the large nullsec empire ? Join TEST, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet or Brave. They are all well known newbie friendly corporation/alliance and they will give you free ships, a place in fleet, and people are generally willing to teach you. They also offer good opportunities for new players to make isk (exploration and salvaging mainly).
---
- Overwhelmed by large organizations but still want to join an active PvP corp ? Try and look for a small faction warfare corp or alliance, there are plenty of them and they will also guide you, get you a place in fleet and you will enjoy endless content.
---
- Want to settle in a bit more in "security" ? Run some combat mission in HS. But try not to do that, really.
---
- Want to become the space Rockefeller ? Look into market, region trading, and all the shit. You won't blow space ships but if you enjoy raw data, data analysis (like, real data analysis) this is your thing. Isk revenue is potentially infinite.
---
- Want to mine rocks and turn them into modules, ships, ammunition ? Start mining and industry. Pro tip, don't do it alone in HS you don't have a single chance, join Goons (= Karmafleet), nullsec have way more valuable ore and Goons are basically the safest most organized industry in the game. You can also join some renter corp but that's up to you.
---
- Want to build your own corp ? Build it with some friends, maybe to do industry, or PvE, or PvP. My 5 isk : FW is a really good way to make isk and have some fight for new players. Low class WH can also be interesting.
---
A short list of advice :
---
- [This is your bible](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)
---
- Right clic EVERYTHING.
---
- Eve is a sand box, figure out what you want to have fun doing and don't bother what other thinks. There is no right way to play Eve.
---
- Faction do not matter. Pick one you feels seems cool and then ignore it for ever since you can fly any ship of any faction without any difference.
---
- Eve is also a dangerous game. Don't use ships you can't afford to loose. Both players and NPCs can wreck you quite fast, even later in the game when you will fly big expensive ships.
---
- People will kill you. No matter where you are, people can and will kill you, even in high security space. HS is actually the worst place to be, because you think everyone is friendly when it's really not the case. Outside, it's a lot more easier, everyone is your enemy.
---
- The very same people that will kill you can also be the same people that will explain to you why you died if you ask them. People in the game are generally friendly and don't mind teaching new players.
---
- Don't get attached to your ships.
---
- Eve shine when played with other people. Don't be afraid of recruitment policies, knock at the door, join a corp, have fun with others.
---
- Learn of your mistakes, don't get angry. If you died, it's your fault.
---
- r/evenewbies it's a good place to ask stupid question. r/evejobs it's a good place to look for a corp.
---
If you're looking for a mentor, DM me. I also have some YouTube guide content.
---
r/awardspeechedits
---
For now. If you look at anything official, delayed is a word that's popped up a lot. They might have made it the same as wormholes as they know the code works, while they work out the code to pit a delay on it.
---
*Updated* bots park a ship on a Raitaru on the gate grid and report intel from overview.  Probably using an out-of-game communication channel so CCP can't see it.
---
This really does not change anything tbh, I always fly paranoid.
---
Are you genuinely fuckin' retarded or are you just pretending? Jesus christ, look up what franchises mean, what genres mean, and what settings mean. You're mixing and matching like a fucking moron. 
---
There is no such fucking thing as a "solo birds eye view" Dawn of War. There is in fact no such genre in all of existence. There are ARPGs, though. Both Warhammer and Warhammer 40k ones. No DoW ones. 
---
It's truly rare to meet someone this thick in this day and age.
---
 You are idiots. Bot does not need a local chat. :D   Why can't you just play the game?
---
Leshaks are the meta for just about everything, Citadels are super nice from a QoL standpoint, a Fortizar is enough for any size of group.
---
The highclass brawl Meta is in a strange space atm where there's still a lot of potential Leshak counters that haven't really been tried yet (partially due to how infrequent large brawls are, partially due to how risky it can be when you have 50-100bil on the line)
---
&gt;other computers use these generator algorythms, and the botters will have to devise some crazy methodology to try and include randomness outside of a truly calculated algorythm
---
You really don't know what you're talking about.  The computing power to determine the random seed from the output random numbers is quite large, and not something an organization the size of CCP would do.
---
And if you want to make exponentially harder, skip a random number of randomly-generated numbers, using a different seed.
---
I mean, wasn't this posted just yesterday?
---
Indy might be a bit much but disabling PANIC would certainly be good. Also some sort of drawback would stop them being used as permatackle in lowsec.
---
No, wormhole timers are much shorter. While in nullsec the fastest time possible between initial attack and destruction is 8 days, in wormholes the attackers can time it so both timers are only about 24 hours long
---
Lets make nullsec dangerous again
---
With over 90% if bounty ISK being generated in null, I think this IS a faucet fix
---
So it is safe space for pvp scrubs? Can you shoot out from there? And does it have time limit?
---
You design tools so players can play and shape the sandbox the way they want. There is a difference between an "open map, full loot, single shard sandbox" and "corridor storyline space sim"
---
If devs make new content, like seeds for players to play around if they want to. For example NPC sotiyos, players decided how much to farm pirate faction titans. Also because of how easy was to steal the loot, it was balanced in a later update.
---
If devs spawn new NPC fleets capable of blaping you without notice and reinforce structures repeatedly, you suddenly have to play against the enviroment because devs introduced a game-changer new mechanic.
---
yes and there is so much content to be had in the other, not-umbrellad regions.
---
the reason there are only 6 regions covered by sueprcap umbrella is because everyone consolidated into those regions. that is a bad thing, not a good thing.
---
Many of those have bought plex with all of their isk when they "quit". Now they have to sell them when they come back to get liquid.
---
i live in the real world where SC is not released and mining is behind a paywall. not this "fantasy back to the future" world where most SC backers seem to live in
---
The cyno button is better than silly dscan
---
No, if you are inside you can’t shoot out and if you’re outside you can’t shoot in. 
---
If you want to destroy it you can, but a fully fueled POS tower will have a 36 hour reinforcement timer
---
And this change only encouraged it further. Just like the drifter attacks only encouraged people to use more supers since its the only thing that doesn't risk instantly dying to randomly spawning insta kill NPCs. This is why I don't understand people being happy about this, it will just make null blocs more dense.
---
Hey man I really like Horde so no hate. You guys take fights and are always good sports about it (from what Ive seen).
---
But as our dear friend mr BBTB2 was trying to point out, Panfam talking about people not undocking is a bit ironic.
---
Then go live in a WH
---
I see, saw that thing for first time yesterday and wasn't sure what it is for, it blocked all my targeting on enemies so I got Confused. It was my first pvp fight where I didn't lose my ship.
---
yeh, but for newbies it should be
---
Nullsecers are bitch asses XD
---
Once you’re citadels work like they do in wormholes, we’ll see who has the biggest balls.
---
If I interpreted this comment correctly I agree with the point being made. People should have viable options to play the game as they see fit, within boundaries of course. The trickiest part perhaps is defining those boundaries and I think that's where major disagreements come from.
---
I don't mean people should be able do everything 100% safely. But I do think there should be a spectrum mixing effort, safety and reward. e.g.
---
- You are lazy and don't want risk. Small rewards to you.
---
- You are lazy but are okay with risk. Moderate reward to you.
---
- You are NOT lazy but also want to avoid risk. Put in the effort and have a moderate reward for less risk.
---
I think that's where PoS, scanning, and other more intricate mechanics come in. 
---
Actually if you think about it it's kinda like it is today. These mega coalitions you called stagnated took A LOT of effort to happen and I don't think it's fair to arbitrarily undermine it. Said that I also think that now that they built something it takes considerately less effort to just keep it and that's what I think might be the root of the problem.
---
It still wastes time. You go into system, see stuff on dscan. After a bit of scanning you realize it’s in a pos, and move on. 
---
But the point isn’t to permanently confuse hunters. Just to waste their time
---
Not till tomorrow
---
Praise Bob. Corpses shall be left in the corpse can in his name.
---
You wont see me tomorrow. I'll be the one dropping on your head.
---
to really shake it up, make it a citadel module or rig that can only be installed at a corp HQ and only activates local for that system.
---
I think it's meant to show how out of touch Mr. Burns is.
---
He finds it more believable that they'd all badly mispronounce his name than boo him.
---
fuck off poser.
---
i have been consistently part of small alliances and corps that actually carve out their part of the universe themselves instead of lying beside line member #29.993 and mooching off of other peoples success. you know, playing a social sandbox how it's meant to be played? not being spoon fed or spoon feeding content like a cry baby
---
nationalism:
---
Apparently you all have forgotten when CCP nerfed the HIC for WH riling and all the salty tears flowing from WHrs.  Now it’s them crying for easier killmails so they can spank it while watching zkillboard.
---
Unless you type in local
---
Playing against the environment has been a common theme in EVE.
---
There are gate guns, and Concord, and NPCs that attack in belts, etc.
---
This is just a spectacular expression of what EVE has always been.
---
So honestly, I don’t even have time to play anymore. But I am resubbing just to show my support.
---
I don’t know for how long, maybe I’ll find some time and get sucked back in - but I want to show with my wallet that CCP deserve some cash/profit for taking some risks... in a game that’s about taking risks.
---
yeah i see the other points now after reading about it alot. less free intel is good
---
Well duh... But situationally a shitload better than a pilgrim. The chance of a lot of folk having extended probe launcher on are slimmer than chance of them spamming dscan. 
---
You see combat probes, don't engage.
---
Tbh everyone is just spanking it to your tears.
---
They still have a forum?
---
Doesn little pirate helper already do this ?
---
yea im fairly new after trying numerous times through the years, I found a great corp that provides tons of help and advise, ive been playing steady for 6 months now and loving it, find a corp in your timezone, I went with a smaller corp because its easier to get to know the people you play with and you will soon be right into it, 
---
We have around 90 toons everyone has multiple alts but around 15-25 active players. The corp is null has members in every facet of the game so always someone to mine with, pi assistance, industry pve and of course pvp, find the right corp and enjoy
---
Doesn't know how to use bosun, misses and hits subcaps.. or forgot he fit lance instead and hits shield titans.
---
If you have a cov cloak you can try gunned posses too, just be 160 km from the stick, and try warping to it, it'll say warp distance is too short if the pass is wrong, so stop your ship and try another pass.
---
at 1 Au, by the time you see tackle on d-scan, it's already on top of you. Even with bot reflexes that gives anyone trying to catch them a fighting chance.
---
I'd like CCP to produce the stats after this next month and see what ratting and mining looks like..
---
...that does not help me much when i cannot compile it myself
---
&gt;Triggered
---
Does a bot check for his own name in local to verify local is there ?
---
So there is a local blackout. Equip a bomber with a warp disruptor and some torpedoes and hop from anomaly to anomaly.
---
Spai everywhere! Well read the code if you are super-duper paranoid.
---
This game is a lot more fun when you just undock and pew.
---
And right now, EVE has an overabundance of materials on the market. That's not even counting the huge stockpiles that lots of people have lying around.
---
i know what the change did and it wasn't worth it. before moon mining changes: quality of skill level in an entity = quantity of line members in an entity
---
but now: get rid of your recruitment standards and let anyone with a pulse in cause you need that m³/hr if you don't want to become irrelevant
---
You underestimate how many people are not on r/eve, never read forums or patch notes, that just login and start grinding. They dont go on comms and use Discord mostly for weeb p0rn ...
---
Comfortable cosykrabbing isn't dying. 
---
It's either upgrading to a cap with a cyno, or going to another part of eve.
---
There are still plenty of low hanging fruit.
---
I hope I'm wrong but I'm not expecting many capital kills due to the blackout. I think a lot of people won't undock since a lot of players don't play for pvp
---
Yeah being tethered with multiple accounts sounds like you have two of those big box fans strapped to your head.
---
Someone hasn't realized yet the huge 3rd party market of cash for Eve items. Can you guess which alliances patkrake?
---
If where talking carriers your allready aligned out. 
---
A battle ship it as simple as be aligned out but stopped. Hit mjd as soon as you see the tackle. By the time they land an lock your mjd is  has likely already gone off. An you mostly aligned out.
---
You can kill lots of things in Corvettes. The Velator in particular is a fine warboat. I use them to suicide gank Ventures. I've seen people kill Tornadoes in them in solo PvP. If you really set your mind to PvPing in corvettes you'll be surprised what you can kill. The Ibis also used to be pretty good before the ECM nerf and probably still has a role in corvette gangs.
---
that's not correct. the very existence of a lot of very old online games debunks your point.
---
getting free samples is now considered being greedy? okaaaaay....
---
Gons just bunch of redditers never believe whatever's they say ;)
---
Not salty, but I think supercapitals were a mistake at least in the current state for the game.
---
what does the blackout actually mean for players? will it be more dangerous?
---
It used to be the thing players would drop down in space they owned and could function as a forward base to live out of, although outside of wormholes (where it was the only way to switch ships safely) it was mostly important because it had a passive mining module and the number of them in a system controlled sovereignty. 
---
Now it is just a leftover relic, with pretty much 0 use for doing anything
---
like a fucking clockwork
---
yes, why?
---
DSONS ARE PRIMARIES
---
If CCP can't even properly detect/ban 10 bots with the same name in the same system ratting for 24 hours a day, this isn't going to do much lol
---
But yeah in theory this would be a useful factor in detecting it
---
&gt; ust because they do not benefit your player experience, they may still be helpful in keeping the game healthy.
---
please elaborate in what way are they helping the health of the game. because AFAIK they just inflate ISK and minerals, leading to the very stagnation that eve is suffering from.
---
Under general, above the window color schemes.
---
I can identify POS trash within about 10 seconds of entering a system using a 5 degree D scan cone.  Please anchor these "confusing" POSes all over your space.  While you're busy with that, I'll be over here murdering your krabs.
---
Jokes on you, no lances on mine÷
---
Not a bad idea. There's people playing this game that need the week or two blackout to go outside and get some exercise and sun before they have a stroke or die of a heart attack at the keyboard.
---
Only 1 sansha incursion spawns in highsec at any time now (used to be 3 or 4), with up to 36hr wait between one spawn dying and new one spawning. The reeeeee was real.
---
Set the shader quality to medium, that stops you from being able to see through the windows.
---
Yeah, too many of the CZ staff have been busy winning EVE, including myself. We were even relevant enough for Mittens to campaign against us from his soapbox :)
---
i am new to this reddit thing
---
I can tell you’re not very bright nor can you follow what i was asking. Nothing to gain from replying to you. I do wonder how people make it in this world. I wish i could award you with the title of “Proper parasite”.
---
I've thought about a system like this, and my solution is twofold: 
---
1. List gets wiped at downtime, and player with the "show in local chat" flag (for lack of a better term) in that system gets re-added (so, players in structures and previously-revealed players. 
---
2. Correlate the "show in local chat" flag with the system, so if they gain that flag in a new system the are dropped from the old system. 
---
It would mean that local becomes more and more useless as the day goes on, but I'm ok with that.
---
(It also ends up being a very complex system that I doubt could be pulled off, but who knows)
---
People getting enjoyment from a different play style than you isn't cancer.
---
i don't think that opinion is that unpopular...
---
I'm dedperately looking for presets who filter poses and or citadels. Dscanning in HS is painful

Here's a terrible idea, how about login rewards like:

Day 1 - lose a frigate to a player - get 10 CCPoints     
---
Day 2 - lose a destroyer to 2 players - get 20 CCPoints    
---
Day 3 - lose a cruiser to 3 players - get 50 CCPoints    
---
Day 4 - lose a battlecruiser to 5 players - get 70 CCPoints    
---
Day 5 - lose a battleship to 10 players - get 100 CCPoints    
---
Day 6 - lose a capital to 20 players - get 500 CCPoints    
---
Day 7 - lose a supercapital to 50 players - get 1000 CCPoints    
---
Rewards Store:    
---
1 CCPoints = 100 x Transparent Fireworks    
---
10 CCPoints = Undocking Booster    
---
100 CCPoints = Local Jamming Charge (fills local with random people not in system)    
---
250 CCPoints = Local Jamming Module    
---
1500 CCPoints = CCP Falcon emote
---
What is a krab?
---
Make friends, trust no one.
---
I think he was trying to say is the game has a lot to offer than just mission running and mining is HS.
---
Been a while since I played. Warped into an asteroid belt a bunch of hostile ventures were there. They started warping out right away and then player operated combat ships jumped it. 2 called worm. I take it this was bots? Is this what I gonna be facing now? Hordes of bots?

One of my buddies from my corp started his EVE adventure in Serenity, when he left for TQ apparently there was bots for everything (including taking sov, devending sov, I think reponse fleet bots, etc). Although it is different as the laws in China regarding virtual stuff is different so the Chinese CCP can't really enforce the EULA.
---
Apparently once there was this Botter/RMTer that got all his bots banned and his isk wiped, he sued CCP and won. Since then they have lost control over banning bots. Although this was a while back.
---
Its interesting how much of a problem local allegedly is because of the free intel, but the dumbfucks dont have a problem with zkb.
---
&gt;Tracking didn't get nerfed idiot.
---
Jesus, dude.  I know it's an eve forum but why so quick with the insults?
---
Does it count as an AAR if there was no Action to report? *thinking intensifies*
---
Yeha but his original post said that mining and mission running in high sec was cancer.
---
You know, you're right. Following some of your utterly ridiculous leaps is something of a challenge. You utterly fail to grasp even such basic things as the differences between franchise names, setting names, individual product titles, genre names and so on, while expecting everyone else to untangle your mess... 
---
... and then you somehow manage to connect this with parasites. 
---
Yeah, following whatever alien twists and turns burrowing through whatever substance exists between your ears is something I can summon neither the energy nor enthusiasm for at this point. 
---
For your own sake and the sake of everyone else you'll inevitably assault with your presence in the future, please learn at least the very basics of the language you try and currently fail to communicate in.
---
This exact thing was on my "to do" list for a while but I was too lazy to finish it, nice.
---
It kind of sounds like there is more to the story than op knows/wants to know.
---
I think facebook, twitter, insta, reddit and other social media do a disservice to society, because they encourage every dumbfuck to share his dumb as shit ideas, just like this one.
---
Next time you have an idea try to do the following: 
---
Realize no one cares about your ideas
---
Don't post it anywhere
---
Thanks for coming to my TED talk
---
yes it's unbelievable.
---
Mostly it means bots are gonna have a hard time
---
Yeah he said it in a demeaning manner. I just corrected it for ya.
---
Salty krabs be like
---
yeah i was having this conversation with someone the other day and I think it makes a lot of sense - as you said airplanes are equipped with ADS and TIS systems which broadcast their location and can be turned off. So what if each ship/pilot in EVE could have a switch/device that controls their access to local - you could even have it so that if you turn off that device in high sec you become criminal (lore: concord requires you to keep ADS enabled for security purposes)
---
because he's wrong.
---
He's hurt so much he needs to relief by insulting people.
---
Thanks friend.
---
With no local at all a dedicated hunter can and WILL catch any bot. Hunters also find and endless amount of motivation when it comes to killing bots over and over and over again so good luck botter!
---
Oh, so I'll be fine
---
&gt;Is it particularly hard to get the larger citadels into certain class WH because of mass limitations?
---
Harder technically but still possible. For C1/C2 that can't fit a freighter/orca you can still haul in the pieces and assemble at a raitaru
---
until you realize how slow they are. They take forever to align and speed is king when you're trying to tackle krabs
---
Dude this subreddit isnt just one person with one opinion. Some people want plex prices as high as possible cause theyre net sellers and some want it as low as possible because theyre net buyers. Stop using this strawman of pretending r/eve is a single hive mind entity thats allowed only a single opinion on each topic
---
Give it up bro
---
If you dont have dreads its astra cheese with your favorite nestor/snake fit.
---
Are you new to trolling, or is this a meta-shitpost?  
---
Either way, you got me.
---
Yea speed is nice and all.. but when local goes away I can take my time to get in position. Then apply my 50+ km point. 
---
Another thing I love about them is their tank is just silly, I've only ever owned one Arazu; it's been Boson'd twice, and shot by high angle titan guns at least a dozen times. Dead ships don't tackle.
---
Botting in highsec will continue.
---
Logically though botters will look for the path of least resistance. If that means shifting their botting to a different game, so be it.
---
no, when local was broken botters didnt care
---
nobody wants to travel to omist or whatever to kill shitfit vnis
---
Decidedly false, i tackled plenty botters because local didnt work.
---
This is something I did/do whenever I quit.
---
I was/am mostly just disgusted that CCP continues to have no ability to accurately determine the unintended consequences of their actions and no interest in listening to veteran players (ie the CSM) who could help them predict and mitigate those consequences BEFORE y will out another easily-abusable mechanic. Instead, they keep trying to fix their ill-considered mistakes (like spawning unlimited anoms), not by reversing or adjusting them, but by making even more of them. At least they're actually giving themselves an out this time. I guess that's progress.
---
Any idea what you'd like to do?
---
Do you want to keep doing missions?
---
Do you want ant to rat? (PvE)
---
Do you want to solo/small gang pvp?
---
Do you want to do fleet pvp?
---
Do you just want to make bank?
---
Do you want to just do exploration( going to relic and data sites for loot you can sell)
---
Yeah that's basically what I was thinking. Should be fun to work around.
---
&gt;Mining in hisec or running missions in hisec is cancer.
---
&gt;Eve is a sandbox
---
&gt;Doing X activity is bad
---
If he wants to run missions or mine in high sec he can do so, and work his way up to incursions etc.
---
Ahhh
---
Do this. Lull your ratters into a false sense of security.
---
Not boys, that was an NPC mining op. If you shoot them support comes. Diamond icon indicates they have harder AI and will mess you up. I lost a Raven on my return to the very same thing.
---
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord
---
He is trampling out the wormhole where the grapes of wrath are stored
---
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift Drifters
---
His truth is marching on
---
Glory, Glory, hallelujah!
---
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
---
I have seen Him in the engine trails of a hundred nano gangs
---
They have builded Him an altar in the salt mines of krab fleets 
---
I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and distant pulsar 
---
His day is marching on.
---
His day is marching on
---
I have read a fiery gospel writ in burnished rows of steel
---
"As ye deal with my drifters, so with you my grace shall deal"
---
Let the Hero, born of the wormholes, crush the krab with his heel
---
Since Bob is marching on
---
He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call “can’t fight, no intel”.
---
He is sifting out the hearts of krabs before His judgment-seat
---
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him! Be jubilant, my Sabre!
---
Our Bob is marching on
---
In the beauty of the holes Bob was born across the stars
---
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and I
---
As He died to make men fight, let us die to make men fight.
---
While Bob is marching on
---
Yes because me calling WHrs whiners is salty tears.  Seriously sucking that WH nutsack arent ya champ?
---
I think its slang for carebear in Russian? Either way, it's synonymous with farming/grinding PvE activity for ISK.

Look at concurrent player count.  If that drops significantly don’t expect the blackout to last.
---
*Do you feel in control?*
---
Super fleets are the counter play to the loss of local so you might as well get used to it or join someone who has a credible super fleet and have a piece of the fun of being part of it.
---
Lol so you dual tank instead. Armor and shield, voila
---
You obviously don't know, especially about the recruitment standards bit. In fact, my corp standards are tougher than what it was before the change. 
---
Sorry that your corp can't kill an Athanor and claim a moon.

"Olmeca Gold booshs all my excavs off. It's fine I'll just buy then back from him later."

---
Aren't all ratters gonna be spamming d-scan now though? How does this differentiate anything?
---
I use isboxer for broadcasting bombers and window management
---
Do: anything that comes to mind. You will find there are things that work and things that do not work.
---
Do not: whine about losing ships. -everybody- loses ships. Losing ships in EVE is the expectation.
---
It also wont have combat probes, which is pretty huge
---
As far as I can tell the service that does chat is different from the he's main engine. They may not have that control, and you're probably right they don't, but it shouldn't be too hard to add in new capability
---
Alt+p opens the probe window, which may or may not be docked in the map. F9 opens system map
---
Which is exactly why chat as an intel tool is so terrible. [We need new mechanics!](https://i.imgur.com/Vs6gyuK.png)
---
Can freighters fit in c4? I can't remember.
---
they put stuff in the quafe to make the trillionares lower plex prices!
---
Nope this game is not for new people. Either be an eve veteran from the beginning or gtfo.
---
clearly you've never been in goons. 
---
as long as a cyno's lit it doesn't matter what fleet you're in as long as you don't leave that fleet once you've lit it.

You have a nice hole.

ok bye!

Yeah pls, do it at dusk, i want to make pancakes.

No freighters are caps ( orca's do fit )

R.I.P. the DDoS of people spamming DScan.   Servers we barely knew you
---
You don’t even have to speak english, can warp into a mobile inhib and anchored bubble, and still get saved from a dreadbomb/leshaks. Ive seen it.
---
I hope you realize that input broadcasting is against the eula and can get you banned

next thing you know is that your lance barely applies damage to your targets

If itsyours, then its intelligence officer.

If it belongs to your allies, its agent.

If its enemy, then its spy.

Got a spy?  Tell him up go scan the chain. Then roll him out. o7m8
---
Here's the problem: you wouldn't have to endure so many countless hours of PVE if there were no botters, because your ISK would be worth more.  You have to compete on price with every bot and triple boxed rorqual, they caused so much inflation that now it's virtually impossible to make your nut on a single account.  You HAVE to parallelize your ISK making to keep up with the guy who has his afk vni running 23/7
---
that would be retarded not being able to drop a super w/ cyno that you just bumped off tether
---
for the plebs that don't have T2 BPOs anyways.
---
Black ops bridges are going to be a ton of fun.
---
So.. technically this was Fweddit vs. the entire universe, since all of those people didn't show up for this fight? Is that how an AAR works now?
---
With 7 rorqs, why not just drop sentries and pop the cyno inhib?
---
CCP keep going over their data plan.
---
yeah, the upvotes and awards themselves seem to be the troll. \*reads again\* \*pukes\* . Gotem!
---
I asked a GM and they said it's fine
---
You forgot Oasa. 
---
Home of the pan galactic co prosperity server farm because that entire damn alliance is bots.
---
15 people is considered a gang, not a fleet.
---
You seem to have overlooked the almighty Punisher
---
Most of highseccers won’t (especially mission runners and like), most of nullseccers won’t. 
---
So unless your “literally everyone” means “me, my corp and few others” then it won’t be too many.
---
Sure he can do what he wants. But if you are playing solo in high sec you are doing it wrong
---
you literally just align your d-scan to the planet and scan, but that's apparently too complicated for spodbrains
---
That would be an accurate description
---
One solo Titan does not get everything done. You usually need 2 Boson to kill anything in a gatecamp, my corp camps a tube in Querious - we know.
---
We're in.
---
It's great to hear ppl bringing their friends into the game who have never played before. I have a couple suggestions for your fit as I use to train new pilots in a Caldari FW alliance for several years. 
---
1.) Check out meta modules for the guns. They may cost slightly more than the basic T1 but they do provide more benefits.
---
2.) Swap out the ionic field projector rig for another core defense extender. 
---
Goodluck to you and your friends!
---
It's actually much better. It'd turn bots into isk sinks instead of faucets. 
---
The issue could be cheapening of faction stuff, and the corresponding power creep. But even that is better than the shitshow inflation we have.
---
When, in 2010 ?
---
As long as you don't have spod for brains, yes. The only people complaining about this are people who do, or who use botting scripts.
---
:popcorn:
---
Probably best to reconfigure your own tab at that point. Find a preset that you like but that doesn't filter those, then filter then manually.
---
Thank you for your advice, i'm just starting to learn to make fits on my own, so its really a first attempt. I will look about it!
---
Just add a random value in the frequency of your d scan spam.
---
Solved.
---
It must be really rewarding feeling when you spend time and effort and finally kill someone who does not give a crap about it!
---
&gt; be aligned out but stopped. 
---
There is no such a thing, btw. if your speed is 0, it doesn't matter where the ship model is pointing. Besides, your whole argument is ignoring cloaks and combat recons. Or tackle VNI. If your bot ignores "ratting or mining" ships, those ships will be used to tackle. 
---
Hm... tackle prospects.
---
&gt;or is the game just a high level killing ground now?
---
Pretty much, but there isnt much fighting. It is almost necessary to join a corporation if you dont want to instantly die to other players who felt it was necessary to join a corporation.
---
Hey that's true! I've overlooked it because of how poor it's DPS is, but i will definitely try that as a cheap tank. Thank you!
---
Triflat technology.
---
Damn, I wish I'd known this back before POSes were being phased out... nice tip.
---
Not all ships have a T2 BPO.
---
However, someone did compile the stats CCP Digoras once tweeted.  Keep in mind that this was 2012.

Time to hunt some hunter hunter hunters.
---
I strongly disagree, a binary polarization of null sec is boring and means no real change can happen.  If you want null sec to feel fun and like you have the ability to change it, you want many small entities with tentative grasps on their space.  Then if you piss off your neighbor it's actually feasible to kick them out and meaningfully hurt them.
---
With 2 - 3 big blocks, you end up just fighting for fightings sake and you can never actually dent their accrued wealth.  The nastiest elephant in the room with eve over its long history is that the costs associated with being a big entity are trivial relative to the resources and wealth acquired.  There are players in this game who are permanently wealthy now which is a real tragedy.  It means they can no longer be exposed to real risk, thus you can never really hurt them.
---
The sooner we seriously balkanize null, the better the fights will be.  The combination of these recent changes (trig's antagonizing unused space and now this) will disincentivize large organizations.  People will still try I'm sure because there will always be strength in numbers, but the harder we make it the more vulnerable they become.  And vulnerability is what makes fighting fun.
---
Player interactions like deploying 1000 titans to structure bash you mean? Yes, super engaging content.
---
No, I don't think "wasting player time" is a good thing, but if that's the outcome CCP has settled on for groups with too many citadels compared to # of capable defenders/structure gunners...then I really don't see it as a bad thing.
---
Don't want to have 200+ structure notifications a day? Maybe try not having 200+ structures, or man them with enough people alternatively.
---
Some insightful shit here bruh. thanks
---
Just give it up, you're embarrasing yourself
---
doesn't matter how many hours have to be endured.
---
the first hour is just as piss boring as the 100th. play a game long enough, you'll always get to the 100th hour, regardless of the number of bots.
---
What more could you possibly ask for ? Fun, Excellent, and even death in the privacy of your own home. Comeback, give a try. Mickey likes it.
---
This will just create more pvp, and force bears to get some goddamn teeth once and awhile.
---
You can bet your ass I'm going to be sneaking through null, every now and then doing the BWAAAP BWAAAP BWAAAP BOOOOOOOO of the EAS in chat.
---
for sure, i've seen guys come in to theta and say "my buddy is in trouble, he's russian" and the guy has got saved just because he did all the right things.
---
just fit a cyno, and have some way to tell people you need help and there's a very good chance you'll get saved.
---
If the cyno gets lit in the wrong fleet, the umbrella will quickly burn a new cyno to the loc 100 off and drop a rag, which will shoot the inhib and light its own.  Then the blob will jump in and the bosons will start to go off.
---
Meanwhile, a ping has gone out for subs, maybe jacks or harpies and 200 of them have formed under Goons 137th best FC (Alice or John), and undocked in under 3 minutes.  They're burning to the location at the same time.
---
So far we haven't consumed the rorq's panic...  All 7 of them get saved.
---
"Delayed local" doesn't mean what you think it means.
---
CCP Falcon [wrote](https://www.eveonline.com/article/pu69gy/nullsec-local-blackout-incoming-during-july)
---
&gt; Local chat in all nullsec space will be switched over to delayed mode. This means that it will behave as local chat in wormhole space, with pilots only appearing in the local population listing should they choose to post messages.
---
I don't have friends, I have alts!
---
Not that it matters, never have I ever guessed a password to a pos that has something shiny in it anyway. But there are still occasionally supers in poses, way deep in renterlands, like dronelands and such, where renters aren't allowed to anchor citadels for some reason.
---
Yes. They've also said this is temporary as well though.
---
Your best toolkit for learning a lot of the mechanics will be youtube. There is a lot of great videos that can explain most things.
---
I would also suggest finding an active group in your timezone. Getting a headset and being on comms so you can talk space stuff.
---
Try a Stratios.
---
L2CONTRAST , its a simple concept...
---
This story would still happen even if there was "normal" local. So I don't know if this is you saying anyone who dies will blame local changes or you are just an idiot.
---
90% of the shit people do in EVE comes from someone in Goons doing it first, we're creative motherfuckers
---
Do not fly anything you can't afford to lose
---
Do not think of your ship as a ship. It's ammo. It's meant to blow up. It will blow up. Try to blow it up in a fun way.
---
Do not allow yourself to stagnate. EVE is a huge game, and if you are stuck doing just one aspect of it, you are not going to enjoy it. 
---
The main fun in EVE comes from the PvP. PvE content is mediocre at best. Use the money you get to buy better ships to blow up against other players, not to buy bigger ships to kill npcs with. 
---
Do not try to go straight into battleships. Bigger is not necesarily better in EVE. Get good at frigates, learn to fly a bunch of different small ships, AND THEN go into cruisers. 
---
Train your capacitor, powergrid, and other "core" skills. They can make a T1 frigate a fearsome opponent.
---

I'd like d-scan to make you visible in local. If you activly scan the system you should be picked up by passive sensors. Wanna stay safe and d-scan every 10 seconds? - You're gonna be visible. 
---
Wanna see what's in the system using some sort of "active sonar"? - You're gonna be visible.
---
Wanna sneak through without being seen? - Don't use active scanning.
---
ha! very underrate respsone
---
From the same article:
---
&gt; The duration of this blackout is undetermined, and we’ll be monitoring what effect this has on the cluster.
---
Initially I _thought_ I too had read 'temporary', but if it proves popular in that it increases subscriptions, CCP would be stupid not to keep it.
---
You can fit 2 enams, 2. compact plates and a dcu on a punisher quite comfortably, throw a scram on there and you got a ~18k ehp bait tackle that can fit in a novice for under 15mil. Most people whove been around a while kinda know whats up, but those who don't will be in for a tasty surprise.
---
I've always known that Eve is the Bad Place.
---
You will never get the time back that it took to think of and write this story. Is trash worth it?
---
&gt; play a game long enough, you'll always get to the 100th hour, regardless of the number of bots.
---
Thats a tautology. If you play the game for 100 hours, you'll always get to the 100th hour.
---
Now you're just being emotional about it. Downtime has nothing to do with the game itself and therefore shouldn't impact the core mechanics of the game. Simple as that.
---
One of them is, but I'm not authorized to say which one.
---
Recon ships price sky rocketing... XD.
---
I think it a good moment to be a torpedo seller.
---
Any darker, you would have needed combat probes.
---
I'm gonna reiterate the "don't get attached to your ships" message here:
---
Every ship in Eve is already destroyed. It just doesn't know it yet. 
---
If you undock, undock with the expectation that your ship, at some point, *will* die. If you're lucky, maybe you sell it before that happens. But at least with that attitude, you'll be a bit less shaken when you get fragged. 
---
Losing fancy and expensive ships sucks, especially as a new player, but the fact that you have to put something on the line to get anywhere in this game only makes it all the more exciting when you do win a fight, or hit a jackpot running relics, or find an amazing market deal.
---
It's a dangerous game, and that's why I love it.
---
sure, but it's pretty much entirely afk gameplay even when done legit. it honestly doesn't make much difference to me if there are 60 bots doing the same thing 1 region over.
---
it's free isk while i do other stuff.
---
WHBOOOOOOO!
---
Have you tried tucking?
---
Imo tristan is one of the highest skill requirements frigate because you need drones skills to make it work, specifically you need drones to 5 and if you actually want to dps in it you need the relevant application, speed and damage skills, which all take some time to train. on top of that, you're not training into gunnery / missiles, which can see a somewhat higher degree of use should they choose to train into something else combat wise. 
---
Personally I love both tormentors and breachers for t1 frigate as they provide good damage and range (tormentor) or  good range control and tank (breacher), but probably your best bet would be to just stick to gallente and go for atrons, which are all around very good ships, have viable fits both for easy high dps (ab + blasters) and for entry level scram kiting (ab + rails) or just kiting (mwd + rails, but I recommend you try ab fits first for fw), and don't need drone skills. 
---
Fly dangerous and good luck!
---
if it isn't permanent, all it'll do is tank the pcu for a week.
---
it's like snow in the uk - we don't prepare for it because it's 1 week out of 52. so we just bitch about it and don't go out for a weekend then it's back to business as usual. it's just not worth preparing for and not worth trying to get anything done that week.
---
As much as I hate the pompous fucks, the tormentor is also pretty damn good. And the Tristan is great for new players because once you spend a week training drones 5 is quite possibly the fastest way to get the highest DPS in your first month. Also less hassle to deal with on tracking and transversal.
---
Good points really. However I don't see how these changes promote your standpoint at all, as fun as that sounds to me unfortunately the only result I can see is people seeking safety in numbers, the super umbrella, and the only place to find a viable one is in one of the three power blocks and maybe FRT if they survive as an entity through July. The rest will be sheeps grazing in the fields waiting to be farmed in an unsustainable risk vs reward equation. Maybe they die a few times until they decide its time to seek safety or stop pveing. 
---
People are people afterall, they seek safety, and I can't imagine anyone being interested in losing rorquals or supers on a regular, and they sure aren't going to downgrade to anything cheaper netting them only a small fraction of the profits they've already had a taste of. 
---
The unfortunate state of Eve and ccp throws the kitchen sink at it trying to enlarge their pocket books as the end result. The last thing they are thinking about is balancing a completely broken game with so many broken mechanics from citadel timers, damage caps, fozzie sov, to timezone tanking, delve (lol) etc etc
---
Is there really ppl streaming rorqual mining ?!?!?   
---
And even worst, is there even a single moron watching it ?
---
Yeah, we'll see what happens. They might see a boost in subscription numbers because of all the cloaky campers that are starting to fill up the region I am in. 1-3 in every system. But i hope they realize those aren't the subscription numbers they want, and active pilots are going to drop off a bit.
---
V keys are for scrubs. 
---
Real paranoid wormholers bind it to spacebar.
---
Cloaking is in no way related to the in game chat system. There's much less protection when it concerns the in game chat system. We've already seen how people can still be in local chat when they aren't even currently in that system, how people can not show up in local even though they are in system, and all kinds of bugs with the chat system.
---
Problem with the punisher is it only has 2 mids so it can't fit the holy trinity of FW tackle, which is prop + scram + web. Its tank is really amazing tho, so switching the tank merlin to a tank punisher makes sense. Just don't fall for lasers on those, as they have a fake and gay bonus to it (cap usage which is basically useless for FW pvp). I recommend you stick to autocannons, which dont use cap anyway, but I have seen some blasters fit around for actually applying dps to stuff.
---
That's not a solution to anything. 
---
All you have done is artificially inflated the number of corporations in the controlling alliance, as they make a new corp for every system they control.
---
Bots will probably take trade-offs by spamming slower or at random intervals but in the end of the day I doubt humans are as consistent. 
---
If you look at someone who spends literally hours ratting and spamming the key, that should still stand out
---
Shhhh don't tell them.
---
Just live off loot?
---
Did this guy just admit to input broadcasting?
---
so you go into the system trough a wormhole. 
---
Or a covert cyno.
---
&gt; TAPI's reputation is founded on the fact that our word is our bond.

But how will anyone know how elite I am if I don't accidentally post vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv in local?
---
Really makes you think.
---
Welp. Time to go see a doctor Bc I’m pretty sure I contracted a disease listening to that.
---
Unless they have friends..
---
You should have seen it furring testing... Op had the ping timer messed up, we got a ping on the hour every hour
---
*sigh*
---
Take your upvote and get out
---
Hey everyone, look, this dude has local open in wormholes.
---
You can set it for any time and for how ever short or long you like but it only gives local in the times it vulnerable, make it biased a RF within 24 hours, or the next vulnerably window so: 
---
Examples: 
---
if it's vulnerable between 6 and 12 and you RF it at 3 it will be out at between 6 and 8 the next day, if it's RFed at 10 it will be out between 9 and 11 the next day etc. 
---
if you set the window for 4 hours you get 4 hours of local between 6 and 12 the rest of the time the structure has no impact this forces people to put the vulnerability in the TZ there active in.
---
Looks like this was fun as hell, i am jealous that i do not get content like this.
---
Is hetero legal now I too?
---
Asking for a uh, not asking.
---
Oof I got fuckin suckered. Begrudgingly lowered my sale orders by a total of about 2b last night assuming nobody would buy them anytime soon and the price would keep dropping. Just checked my ISK balance, it all sold. 
---
Fuck me, lol.
---
^^^^its ^^^^only ^^^^$20 ^^^^an ^^^^hour
---
Yeah, I think the bottom line there is, if you lose a ship and you take it to heart or it bothers you, you aren't going to make it in this game. Everyone makes mistakes and fucks up. I've seen it happen in my old corps to 10+ year veterans because they weren't paying enough attention.
---
Miners are out there losing orcas to Blops drops, it's just about mitigating factors and how many you lose. /u/fabiooh00

And if they got a recruitment link that puts them the 1.75m so total for injecting...
---
No he can warp off as soon as the DD is done. Won't disappear off grid if he logs out for 5 minutes though (well, 1 minute after DD cooldown is done I think it was, and DD cooldown can be as low as 4 minutes).
---
So I don’t know much about structure timers as I rarely bash structures, the astrahause we bashed in J-Space was over a week to kill. Do different citadels have different timers?
---
No. The commissar will be seeing you in an hour.
---
Indeed its a lot more fun when they cry about it. Initially its not super easy to know if its a bot or a person ratting/mining though. We crab what we can and get out. A kill is a kill.
---
Fuck yesterday night when Plex was still 3.7m each I was like: "too lazy to go to Perimeter, just wait for tomorrow"

&gt; Dune is the worst SciFi series ever it should be banned.
---
I really liked the first prequel book that Frank Herbert's son, Brian, had a part in writing, ["Dune: House Atreides"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune:_House_Atreides).  I didn't read anything after that.
---
I was lucky enough to see one of the various 'extended cuts' of David Lynch's 'Dune' movie while stationed on a military base.  It was pretty good, though far from the books.  All the cuts I've seen since then (stream, TV, DVD, etc.) have been horrible, atrocious, utter garbage.
---
The TV series [Frank Herbert's Children Of Dune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert%27s_Children_of_Dune) was much closer to the books, and overall I thought pretty good, with some stand-out performances &amp; scenes.  It suffered mainly from being a small budget production.
---
There is a really simple solution to show CCP, if this blackout will work
---
\- for those who don't like it: just don't login for some days
---
those who like it will login anyway.
---
the numbers will show what will happen in the future.
---
If you put a tarp under DBRB, you'll come away with enough to feed a family of four because he doesn't even shut up to eat.
---
Everyone will copy your symbol if there hunting you specifically, like most of the time people don't bother because effort and most scanners are cloaked anyway, the reality is the symbols breed lazy habits of not verifying if something is friendly.
---
A lot of players play for free, which usually means they want to at least make the isk needed to buy 500 plex every month, without having to rat themselves to an early grave in real life. So its understandable that they don't want to be farmed like NPCs.
---
I think this sounded much better in your head.
---
Yup. So long as you're open to learning from mistakes, you're golden. 
---
Just remember not to be like [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c8e85l/how_to_kill_a_rorqual_with_JUST_TWO_SHIPS_%28spodbrains_hate_him%21%29/esmp6nf/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), because that's being *deliberately* and unashamedly dumb. Also probably botting given the alliance and activity so yeah.
---
Play the game, die in a glorious hellfire, get a new ship, and return the favour. And when all else fails, buy twenty frigates and spend a week in lowsec until they all get blapped. Cheap flights are just as fun as expensive ones.
---
No. You probably just timed it wrong, to get the initial attack time right you need to scan the citadel with that special data analyzer and then you get information on its timers.
---
So you'd like local blackout to essentially be meaningless, since you automatically dscan when you enter local.
---
woo mah brain hurts like 1/4 in
---
There are few things that bring an immediate grimace to ones face when you instantly hear it. PGL's voice is one of those few things.
---
Created my first character last year, stopped playing for around six months. Just couldn't get myself through the tutorials...
---
Gave it a second chance in January, after a friend talked me into it again. In March I joined a nullsec corp after I got comfortable enough. Three weeks ago I went Omega.
---
So, yes. In my opinion it's an awesome game. Find the right corp for you, you'll have an awesome time.
---
Never not be uncomplicated.
---
Test Alliance: fun as hell to fly with. Brain cancer to interact with.
---
Wait.. is this real? Why the fuck would this be real.
---
And plex is back up.

See local for only 50 Plex/day, accepting organs and soul pawns

Context?

Learn to google things. Based on your inability to find literally countless new player guides already posted on this sub, the forums, and countless other places, you're gonna have a hard time.

Because we follow orders of our smarter leaders. Get with it pubbie.
---
When I recently came back I used the GM ticket to jump my best ship and all I could cram into it to Jita. I had to leave a lot behind and this asset safety feature was not explained to me at the time. Thank you.
---
Thanks a ton for the help. This will at least give me a chance to recover what I can.
---
People will be out roaming more. They will run into each other and/or force out response fleets. 
---
It's really not that difficult to grasp.
---
Rich guys in Eve are engaging in market manipulation?  I never thought I'd see the day.  We must alert the masses!

Best balance change in years!

It’s a pun involving James Bond the legendary spy who is associated with the phrase 007 or Double O’ 7. And in eve we say o7 to each other as a greeting. So a spy in eve is Double o7
---

---
Ah ok

---
sorry i forgot to consider you as people
---
Strangely enough Yes, you would be surprised !
---
Seems like a lot of people are resubing as well. If CCP looses some money but finds a huge increase in content, it could pick up subs more and minimize, if not prevent the slow fall off of the active player base since 2011. Honestly if the city builders who like the save fun of null currently leave I wouldn't mind much. Eve isn't a city builders it's a PvP experience. One of the most unique experiences that has yet to be replicated in a successful way and to pander and diminish that experience for a.... Arguably majority of people is straying form its core. I'm interested minimum to see the effects.
---
The amount of upvotes this post received is a clear indicator how the vast majority of this sub completely misses the ball when understanding homeland defense and escalations in nullsec.
---
Either data or relic works. Don’t forget a ship scanner to see if it is fit or not.
---
This is actually built into the launcher profiles.
---
Make your profiles and assign them to the accounts and they'll always open to the same place and same dimensions.
---
Yes he's also clearly a time traveler, since this is a post about something that will have happened two days from now.
---
Shit we can chew through steel bro, y’all motherfuckers are the adverse risk densure wearing poontangs.
---
SC has so much potential, but some of the design decisions...
---
Any scout worth his salt is figure out if something is a viable target or POS trash without moments of entering system. You have specific overviews setup detecting force fields, drones, towers, etc. It might take 30 seconds instead of 15.
---
Don't be daft. What he means is a bird perspective RTS Warhammer game. Like Dark Omen or Dawn of War.  
---
Consult Google before pontificating what is or isn't a thing because you were wrong and made a fool of yourself.
---
Those kind of fights don't happen.
---
"If you find yourself in a fair fight, both you and your enemy fucked up."
---
If they are allowing the capacity of temporary hacking the Observatories , I will be totally in for this though.
---
I can smell burned neuron smoke from here.
---
IKR drones platform need quite a lot of skill to be good in solo, but we aren't gonna solo anyway, I'm just gonna D-scan solo ppl to catch them, so even if the fits are quite poor, in 3 to 1 its really powerful enough. And while we do that, I can teach them more of the game so they know what kind of gameplay they gonna play next, that's why they are fits that require only a week or less of training.   
---
TLDR they aren't made to be good, they are made to be cheap, and good introductions to the basic mechanics of the game (movement, D-Scan, turret, targeting, distance control, drones, ...) and we will get better together after that, each using our own playstyle in the best way possible.  
---
But thanks for your advice, I will, of course, make more fits like this, to introduce them to other mechanics as well (and as many skills are redundant it won't take weeks but days or even hours), like missiles, armour tanking, etc... and every info is welcome!
---
Oh lawd, you madman, you did it!

---
Dang, if only there was an exceedingly obvious slider for window transparency level in the settings menu, how unfortunate.
---
Well the d-scan bot is not as scary as the d-scan bot. The local bot triggers before i can even move, as i am still in session change. But the d-scan only once i start warp ... those 2s delay in triggering the warpout, that already makes the difference in almost all cases ...
---
Ccpls let me load an ibis with antimatter charges and shoot it from the two spurs of the Naga like a gigantic planet killing railgun
---
You do realize that all modern botting programs have built in randomness so that you can't just pick them up with a script, right? Right down to the way that the mouse moves.
---
... how did you actually manage to have *less* reading comprehension than him? Did you miss half his post? He is referring to a *single character* game. This is in all likelihood the Inquisitor ARPG, or Diablo-like if you will.
---
Just adapt
---
Okay, I feel stupid now.
---
Thanks.
---
Politics and EVE dont mix.
---
Im not so sure how positive a change it would be. Love the reasoning behind it and the end goal but i think the realities of no local in null will not achieve those goals. The biggest impact it will have on roaming gangs is the amount of time they spend warping around looking for people who are not even there. null is going to feel more empty than it already is.
---
I don't understand how the blackout affects botters and cheaters?  Can someone explain to me?  All I do is mine ores in high sec Gallente space.
---
That can't be scanned or probed down, and engage players from vast distances and generally don't fit the mold of any previous NPCs.
---
But sure, it is a "expression of what Eve has always been".
---
Oh Jesus. That was the best isk you could get in hisec besides station trading. How sad. Now it will be easier to get them moving ;D
---
Yea it's a great time to join, I would recommend doing the tutorial getting some hours under your belt then joking a small low class Wormhole group. It will be much smaller than the big null block groups and you will learn alot very quickly.
---
That being said alot of people love starting out in a null.
---
But it is definitely not 2 late to start. It is a big learning curve but if you stick it out you will love it.
---
Or join one of the big new player corps and get a bunch of ships starter ships for free, plus a chat channel where you can ask any question you want and plenty of people will help you out. Then, if you get bored and want to try something else, just leave.
---
A new player is not going to know what ships they want to fly, they're not going to figure out what pirate space they need to go to for meta modules, and are not going to research doctrines. This is all more advanced stuff, and frankly kind of limiting. My preferred doctrine is whatever the heck I feel like right now.
---
Do you even D-scan bro? 🤔
---
One person will stay visible. 
---
Rest of the gang isn't.
---
Huge stockpiles...   and that isn't including all the assets that lie locked behind unused/unsubbed accounts.
---
Thats how your fleet knows youre elite
---
When some other scrub posts in local and you dont react, because its not open
---
dey tuuk er jerbs!!!11
---
That works, but some epithal pilots try to burn out of bubbles and escape. I plan to do it as a way to be a pain in the neck to people personally.
---
Now this is ~~gold~~black
---
I'm not too familiar with the Star Trek series, and I thought the teleporters were something that worked pretty well. What's up with that 3rd picture?
---
How does that work, anyway? If the floor is now half metal half flesh doesn't that mean there will always be parts of her stuck in there no matter how much you clean? I guess you could put a rug over that spot once you chop off as much as you can.
---
I'm assuming she's *very* dead, but with heart, lungs and brain intact she might be able to survive for a few hours... I'm overthinking this way too much.
---
Its amazing how a lot of people never use combat probes
---
No one is warping to anything other than anoms. So your merry little plot isn't helping anyone. 😑
---
Can you scan down gate guns, Concord, belt rats?
---
No?
---
Okay then.
---
How? Are you going to now tell me he is somehow now not responsible for his own actions?
---
There's only two options here: either he transferred ownership and is responsible or someone else who had ownership transferred ownership over his head and he never had the authority to make such a promise in the first place.
---
No reimbursement for anything lost under black out . Sorry in advance.
---
If you're looking for someone to mentor you for a bit so you can get to where you want to go faster just let me know. I'm helping new players more than actually playing the game nowadays. Either way, see you in space!
---
I’ll be sitting on gates with a naga and bubbles, good luck.
---
The big fights will be interesting because it's going to be more difficult to determine who has the upper hand. It's feasible that one or both sides will keep surprise caps in another system or off dscan range of the staging citadel, so some FCs will stand down more often and others will commit to fights that turn out to be traps.
---
Uhm other people know this. You aren't special. And I look forward to seeing you die on a gate somewhere
---
The rich manipulate all markets, the real question is not if but to what degree.
---
Those kind of fights happen only by chance and VERY rarely, unless they are decided before hand by the two FCs who agree to bringing a certain ammount of people. So not really sure what you are talking about.
---
Facts that I see here: intel will be less perfect, some programs won't be working (Near2), ratting or mining in a no-tank ship will be a far worst option than before, and everyone will probably either go on a roam to NS or sit tight in a citadel waiting in a defense fleet ready to repel attackers. 
---
All things considered, I think the stage is set for a lot of ships blowing up this weekend. And that alone is awesome.
---
Also, covert/cloaky (probably T3C) fleets will play important roles in these fights going forward. That's what I'm really looking forward to.
---
You could always use a [cryptographically secure random number generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator).

"How's it look?"
---
"Looks clear..."
---
\*\*bioraptor flock rushes by\*\*

"You said it was clear!"

"I said it 'looked clear'."
---
"Well, how does it look now?"
---
"...looks clear."
---
Ah, cheers. Most times I listen to a podcast or something in the background but sometimes I miss the classic music. CCP did an excellent job with the soundtrack
---
But a Bolter helps as well.
---
I was wondering that, too. If it goes on long enough we might see migration to lowsec for some PVE activities.
---
But no one ever blind jumps a fleet to say a gate outside of dscan. So when your scout finds a fleet of 100 HAC's with logi and you have a kitchen sink fleet of 30 ships. You will just turn around. This is Eve and Eve players always flee from risk. I can't see the number of times two fleets find each other in a situation they can't run from going up that much just because there was no local
---
Downtime is basically a mechanic, considering its impact on many great battles. CCP never even considered postponing it when necesarry.
---
Look at all the Elite PvPers who only can kill afk ratters resubbing like they're not gonna get Titans and Supers dropped on them still. It's adorable
---
The ship was passing through a series of subspace rifts that made random parts of the Hull phase out of existence. That woman was unlucky enough to be walking over a floor plate that phased out. 
---
She’s super dead. In the episode she screams for a moment, presumably when it happened, and stopped suddenly, again presumably when her diaphragm became part of the deck.
---
As for the transporters, there are a TON of redundant safety features that would never allow something like that to happen
---
So no one arrived and thus the superior strategy that no one else knew about won the day that didn't actually happen. Outstanding strategy that Helmuth von Moltke himself would be proud of you go guys you go.
---
The new meta will be each rorq will be surrounded by 10-15 avatar titans in a pinwheel pattern with bosons at the ready. We call this the our **"Dicks out for Spod"** fleet.
---
They treat teleporters like space magic from time to time. Like [Tuvix](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Tuvix).
---
Woah, i thought mining was boring, imagine watching someone else doing it. Your not even making money...... Never underestimate eve players autisms they say huh.
---
Very old isn't the same as eternal. And the actual point was the second part, which your comment doesn't negate in the slightest.
---
I tried to read that forum post... it's extremely painful. It reads with three or four major repeating themes.  
---
* A rather strong flow of random people posting they are concerned. 
---
* A rather strong flow of random people posting they are happy.  
---
* A flooding torrent of "whoa angry" people claiming to be so angry they are quitting with their 2-15 accounts.  
---
* Around 40-50 repeat customers responding to almost every single person that expresses they are unhappy or quitting.  
---
My take away? If half (which I doubt) of the claimed accounts being unsubbed are closed, that's something like 7000 accounts easily shutting down. I'm hoping all of the people that have quit and are resubbing can equal that number, although I'm not that confident in a business model that relies on people that already quit.
---
If i botted, i would just buy more ships for the replacements as the reality is, unless someome farms my one bot more then 6 times in a single day, i can farm more isk then they can take from me
---
And most of us have boat muted lol.
---
Oooh and can we make recons have a feature to automatically teleport to the weakest non pvp ship in constellation and auto tackle?
---
The best way to stay alive on a boat fleet.
---
This is very entertaining.
---
A weapon to surpass metal gear
---
Even better, make a button that teleports your ship directly on top of any target ship type you specify in the target system, from anywhere in the galaxy.  Make this button also tackle and shoot the ship you teleported on top of, automatically scooping the loot and posting on reddit once destroyed.
---
Some of the best bots that have remained undetected use random.org 
---
However yes, it is the closest thing to random that can be randomised... :/ 
---
CCP's track record of capturing and identifying these bots is really poor at best, so even some crappy randomiser would probably go undetected.
---
Only if they can fit their own pds and DD or whats the point?
---
Then I don't have accept your opinion on the matter.  It's your job to backup your arguments not anyone else.
---
How about a module that automatically jump your recon near the closest pve ship in your constellation?
---
“ALLAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH”
---
There is a post about this every week , do you want a medal or a cookie OP?
---
&gt;In 2016, I recorded ProGodLegend and DurrHurrDurr in voice chat.
---
FTFY
---
Anticipatory plagiarism.
---
Great minds think alike.  This would be a real enhancement to the game.
---
You're stupid. Re-read what he said. 
---
Repeat until you get it.
---
Low budget botting
---
Nah this is weak. The ship should be teleported to the recon.
---
From my understanding it seems most people learn their corps ship names more then use an identifier. If one is unknown then it gets called out and normally dismissed pretty quick as friendly. Just communication. Make eve communicate again?
---
Yes, I rarely listen to it anymore, but it is amazing.
---
Interesting points to consider. I hope it does not turn into more people standing down from uncertainty
---
Muh farmville must be preserved no other playstyles accepted? I like how you assume my position.
---
I hear these guys have a pretty good corp: https://zkillboard.com/character/3019581/
---
Be sure to invite them to all your roams.
---
Who's paying for my chemo?
---
check https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z7dkJrFiKZo4w_xVgJSmWCUyvKQ8Ha8Q/view 
---
It's more for solo. Maybe think a bit of ewar and stuff like that. But just three guys flying stuff that would work solo isn't the worst thing to start off on.
---
I tried to adapt the fits for the eve uni fight club rules once: https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/User:Erwin_madelung/Sandbox
---
Maybe good for low skills as the fight club doesn't allow T2 weapons.
---
OK but the example you gave wasn't really "a risk", it was a pretty much guaranteed welp.
---
Hello from /r/starcitizen.
---
This is hilarious and on point. 
---
Best part is how ED players don't have legs because they haven't programmed them, and SC players don't have legs because the code ate them.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't they get rid of leaving your pod in Eve? None of us can have legs! \o/
---
Seems like this guy fell asleep in the middle of writing and smashed his head ontop of the "post" button
---
That idea is not great but it's not terrible either.
---
I hope some people decides to do some activities in lowsec while this lasts, maybe some will like it and stay there.
---
But to be honest, nothing will really make LS thrive until CCP does some very needed changes to the region. Who knows, maybe this NS shakeup is just a first step and then it will be time for LS changes... one can only hope.
---
ermagerd now I'm skurd pls bring local back!
---
I left that part a little open ended. I know two FC's before hang giving out the fleet size and Doc is very rare. But the ever so elusive solo or say an even odds 1v2 is the kind of even fight I was referring. You know the kind of fight where you don't just GF the second grid loads because you know exactly how it will ended
---
Everyone who is going into nullsec, keep your screen recorders on and put them to Youtube even if you don't have a proper channel. I'll be watching all of them.
---
I'm with the boss theory.
---
He looks pretty good for a being who's one third plant.
---
i love this alliance's comms.
---
amen
---
we never left high-sec, we just made null sec alts to make isk and then shoot people without concord blowing us up, or we join the gank fleets and blow you up in high sec anyway
---
It brought in new game subscriptions. B-R was the catalyst for Brave Newbies to start up.
---
*insert thank you for here*
---
Alliance just exist. There is little in the day to day that requires more then a few people coordinating to maintain that. This will require defense fleets, mining protection fleets. Backup or support fleets. There will actually be things to do and require some communication other then "hey, there is a guy 5 jumps from the pocket"
---
Lol
---
Used solo in low. So I learned that one already
---
There are skills for this.
---
Snuff and init reffed our fort for the second time. We punted armour and then formed max dudes for hull. Max dudes consisted of more than 'some close friends', we had almost 200 in fleet. Snuff appeared to be forming stukas but apparently this was for a test titan in omist, which managed to get away. By the time Snuff was back in Black Rise the fort had about 4 minutes left. With everyone's balls being so very blue we killed our CEOs monitor then everyone went their separate ways.  
---
Feel free to correct me or add to this, I was pretty fucking tired towards the end of fleet.
---
One thing is certain, we can rest assured that CCP hasn't thought about anything beyond just doing the Blackout either way...
---
"hehehehehehe I have a funny story- -"
---
  Shit *mutes*
---
Leaving pods in station yes but you can stil leave pods in space.. thats how corpse collects get them.
---
blow me up in highsec lmao
---
Swing and a miss.
---
Point taken that was a bit of an extreme example. But even if the odds are closer to even with the extra uncertainty of no local do you think fleets will take more fights or less?
---
First time attempting EVE journalism ... let me know how terrible it is :D
---
God forbid the big fleet learns to bait correctly, or... shocking concept here: learn to scalate according to their foe.
---
If only we could have selective muting on twitch so we would not have to hear him during the Meta Show.
---
I'll focus on doing the tutorials for now, but I'll shoot you a DM if that becomes relevant~!
---
Because they are.
---
This comment is like in World War II, when Hitler decided to invade Russia
---
Google pirates little helper, thank me later :P
---
in terms of performance per SP, destroyers are very very good, because most of them do not tie their raw damage to skill train
---
so I might recommend trying out a destroyer group instead....
---
frigate-wise though...  the Incursus and Punisher and quite strong.....
---
Logistics guys &amp; gals are the backbone of all good alliances.
---
I should read discord on my spy alt more often.. Didn't knew you guys were moving.
---
1. don't setup POS
---
2. don't log in.

3. enjoy the outdoors.

4. come back on Monday and collect all the salt from redditors complaining that carebears didn't log on and die.

Nah my alt was at Jita

Holy shit lol

sounds gay.
---
&gt; And definitely not fucking wormhole space since it'll be just like nullsec but without sov and supers and other bullshit.
---
lol.
---
If it lasts long enough without any increased incentive for living in NS, then I believe it will push a lot of people toward LS.
---
Particularly non-mining oriented players who relied on ratting ticks just to get by.... these people IMO will be hit the hardest, pressured the fastest... and may go to faction warfare or other LP-sources for isk making
---
That isn't anywhere near full retard for Durr and PGL.
---
Hold up. Are you saying that Eve players aren't the diehard PVPers they want to make everyone believe they are?
---
Did the NDA expire, thus this release?
---
This. Is. The. Truth.
---
Check out [dotlan](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map) and pick a lowsec region with low activity (few jumps per hour, NPC kills per hour, etc) and there will be tons of data and relic sites.    
---
The value of them will be a lot less than null and wormholes of course.
---
Now ya do! :D
---
I just want to know how you got a [Light Veles Entropic Disintegrator](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98582769/) on a Zealot.
---
Brilliant.
---
Would be hilarious if a huge bunch of people in ibis start writing "yo" "waddup" all around null
---
&gt; As for the transporters, there are a TON of redundant safety features that would never allow something like that to happen
---
And a ton of ways for [other terrible things to happen](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Transporter_accident)

also ... totally thought this would end up on Kotaku but their help section is worth jack poopsicles and it ended up at this weird url instead. Oh well.
---
I've become one with the kiki and can now triglav at will.
---
Just use a fucking Dominix you prick, as if anyone could fucking tell from dscan whether or not you're blue in this obvious ratting ship that is probably hugging a forsaken hub.
---
Except botting rorquals do not make things more expensive, quite the opposite. Botting for ISK sources does.
---
Fit emissions scope sharpener rigs to your ships, and google the rule of 6. Beyond that it’s just a matter of luck/skills

How do I sort by low jumps or npc kills. It only lists most voilent systems in recent stats
---
Agreed, I was searching for a Mexican standoff type gif but I feel like it will be more appropriate for that in a few days.
---
Oh yeah, solo or micro gangs even fights are quite common in Lowsec... but there are no FCs there.
---
Pretty sure d-scan is the V key, so still needs work
---
At the top right there's a drop down menu that lets you sort by stats. Or you can add #jumps or #npc to the url. For example:

thats too much work, i rather a random pve ship just explodes every time i board my recon and i get credited for the kill

This reads like a bad anime quote that you were dying to use somewhere, gave up on finding an appropriate situation, and just selected this comment at random for it.

The forum thread has player after player boasting about how many accounts they have, as they claim they are unsubbing them. 
---
I tell them all good riddance, you never undocked to fight anyways, hid in pocket systems with protective fields of bubbles on the gates. No one knew they were here, no one will miss them.
---
Proud of u, keep it up
---
Most likely they moved a couple Blockade runners with compressed ore and some blueprints, still though amazing effort.
---
It depends greatly on Corp then, because many corps like I said aren't super easy to get into stuff as a newer member because of doctrines. I've offered to Logi for many many different activities and it always came down to "Fleet full" or "that's not doctrine"
---
The other problem is attitudes like yours. Instead of offering advice on better corps for newer members, new players or veteran free agents to get into, people would rather take a condescending tone and blame the newcomers for their difficulty finding a good place in the alliance.

Ah, didn’t know there were specific timers. I just assumed the ref timers started when you bashed it
---
Question: I have a character that primarily does mining. I just looted an implant worth about $50 mil isk running a combat site that gives a +3 to memory. I see that memory is the primary attribute that effects mining, but I don’t know how that actually works. If I plug it in will my mining yield increase every cycle? If so, by how much? Trying to figure out whether to plug it in or sell in Jita. Thanks in advance
---
This is deceptive. You are competitive with long-term players flying cheap T1 frigates. A player with billions of isk and 50+ million SP is going to take their Hecate out and vaporize any newbie in something smaller than a cruiser. Even in cheaper ships the experienced player is likely to have more actual flying skill and the ability to buy an unlimited number of replacements.
---
That being said, a new player can certainly compete over time, especially if they join up with other players. No ship in a fleet is worthless. But a solo newbie in a Merlin is probably not going to be able to go around blapping experienced players how a new player in, say, Call of Duty would be able to get some kills here and there. They'll need to spend some time learning the mechanics and earning some isk to really get into the competitive scene.
---
A new player can absolutely *contribute* to other players and be valuable to corporations. But if they are planning to solo dominate a player who's been playing Eve for 10 years? Unlikely.
---
Ty. But y does low sec give more relic and data sites than null sec? Logically null sec should have the highest density of anomalies per system given the risk involved.
---
Not anymore, that’s how POSes worked but with citadels, defenders get to choose the day and approximate time of the final timer. So if you set up the armor timer to happen on the same day as the final timer will, you’ll have to wait a week for the final timer.
---
Reimbursement ticket:  I lost my carrier.  I kept hitting Y on dscan but nothing ever showed up, even while on grid!
---
&gt;I don't want observatories at all. It's just more junk people have to anchor and maintain and it'll be compulsory.
---
I think a lot of people aren’t seeing the potential that observatories as a series could have. We’re so used to the ubiquity of local that we assume that’s going to be their primary function (not saying you suggested that), or some kind of similar equivalent. There are so many other things they could do with varying degrees of precision and certainty. They don’t have to be limited to existing intel sources.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Some unique types of collections they could do off the top of my head: (keep in mind that there are many ways to make any given intel less powerful, so it doesn’t necessarily have to be the worst imaginable use-case)
---
* Mining volume per day/hour/period
---
* Number of ships logged off in space/in a structure
---
* Lists of structures in a region/constellation/system (ones you would otherwise have to physically search for in space)
---
* Average number of given shiptypes or classes in space/docked over time
---
* Completion of moon chunk pulls
---
* Types of IHUB upgrades active
---
* More robust/customizable intel on existing intel (a chart of NPCs killed per hour over a week, pilots in space over 24hrs, etc)
---
* Usage levels of specific Gates/or structures
---
* Information on what other observatories are collecting
---
* Records of pilots who were in a systemstructure over time
---
* Localized non-NPC locators (like locator agents)
---
* Number of fleets active in a given area
---
* Volume/value of goods entering and exiting an area
---
* Value/classes of goods being produced
---
* Market and trade values of an area
---
The list goes on...
---
Then there is also something that I rarely hear mentioned: intel suppression and spoofing. AFAIK this kind of infowarfare just doesn’t have a real presence in EVE, with the only thing that actually does this being the mobile scan inhibitor. For most other things the best you can do is manipulate your actions to make it less reliable (logging in everyone’s alts to inflate numbers, logging off to hide a presence, etc.). There is so much more that could be done with this.
---
Things like:
---
* Decreasing the range/specificness of dscan
---
* Increasing delay of starmap intel (pilots in space, NPCs killed, jumps)
---
* Supressing certain types of collection from other observatories (making any one of those things above less accurate or more difficult to obtain)
---
* Spoofing intel sources from above to be less reliable
---
* Decreasing probe strengths or increasing cycle times
---
* hiding or misrepresenting connections of jump gates
---
* Removing or delaying the appearance of signatures in the Agency
---
* Disguising a structure as another type of structure
---
* Randomly snagging chats from random systems in eve and cluttering up the local chat to confuse
---
I’m sure I could come up with a thousand other uses cases for both collection and suppression. It’s really a shame that this kind of metagaming is so narrow right now.
---
So much to the myth that only intelligent people play EVE.....

Props to our logistics teams! Super smooth moving my stuff to the new staging.
---
Relic and data sites are considered signatures and are separate from anomalies. So any upgrades in nullsec that increase anomlies per system do not apply to relic/data sites. Likewise there is a respawn time and other factors such as a rumored max number of sites per constellation. So if you're in a great part of nullsec, other explorers may have come through an hour or so ago and cleaned out the place. Some veteran explorers will cherry pick the sites (generally frowned upon, but this is EVE so ymmv) and clear out several systems in minutes. Meanwhile in lowsec, veteran explorers generally don't bother cause of the lower drop value, so a lot of data/relic sites will just sit there for days until a rookie explorer comes along and takes an hour to complete one then logs off for the day.

That was a pretty good read, and as someone who participated in that move with my ratting alt, it's really impressive how everything was coordinated to both leave Geminate safely (well, mostly) and find a lot of infrastructure ready to welcome beans in their new home.
---
That being said, holding few assets and keeping them consolidated in one or two places like I do makes things far more easy. I actively use "only" four characters, and keeping all my ships and assets to the minimum makes having to move with any of them a pretty easy task.
---
The ventures are fitted. There is over 3000 of them. That takes more that "just a few clicks". Takes many. Almost PI cancer many.

I might be wrong, but I remember the initial announcement being "blackout during july" implying that local will be back up at the end of the month. I hope this is their way of testing it to possibly implement permanently, but that's probably too much to hope for.
---
Really? As someone considering returning to EVE after a long break, that's real interesting. Have all the PoS stuff been transferred to the new upwell? Are there replacements for smaller-scale corps and such? I knew there were bigger and better nowadays but I didn't know they were full-on relics.

I'm sorry...what?

Yeah, it's pcgaming.com social journalism shit, but I kind of believe the part about sources conspiring against CCP while at the same time telling them how mundane this is, thus just asking for a citadel to fucking burn. God I hope that's next, or at least they show for stage 2.

DurrHurrDurr is a treasure
---
&gt;The other problem is attitudes like yours
---
As opposed to your attitude of "I'm gonna lie to the newer members".  That's far more helpful.
---
&gt;I've offered to Logi for many many different activities and it always came down to "Fleet full" or "that's not doctrine"
---
If you did this in TEST, you are 1) lying again - we always need more logi on alliance fleets, or 2) slapping a couple reps on a random ship and calling that logi, or 3) attempting to bring the wrong-sized logi - you can't bring a cruiser to a frigate fleet and vice-versa because it doesn't work....but we run a large variety of fleets so you could have easily found a fleet the right size.
---
For example, fly an Osprey.  We'll take you on every fleet that is normally logi'ed by Basilisks.  Need to tweak the fit because your skills are too low for the doctrine fit?  We'll *still* take you, but you may get reduced SRP if you die....but if you say "I'm new" when asking for SRP that will probably be waived if your tweaks make sense.
---
&gt;and blame the newcomers for their difficulty finding a good place in the alliance.
---
The forums literally have a "Careers" sub-forum, which lists what jobs are available and where to sign up for them.
---
There's also multiple mentor and mentor-like programs/places where you can ask questions like "how do I get started in \_\_\_\_\_?".

I think it will at first but won't in the long run.

Everyone is going to play more carefully in the beginning, but the longer the blackout goes the more people will go back to their normal routines (with some adaptations).

---
Selling PLEX under 4 mill is just not profitable at all. It is just plebs doing that.
---
Cyno beacons, jump bridges, all industry, etc have all been moved out of POSes and into upwell stuff. Small corps just live out of Astras, since those are cheap. 
---
The only reason they are still in the game is they serve as a quickly anchored forward operating base. As soon as the upwell equivalent for that is launched POSes will be 100% pointless
---
Reading this gave me stress.

Join nullsec space guild, manufacture whatever they are flying the most, at least 3 reasons:  
---
Most of the time you will get the materials from local industrialists for Jita buy, or even less.  
---
Manufacturing bonuses are greater in nullsec facilities that you'll have access to.  
---
Greater profit margins, especially if you seed fit doctrine ships on contracts.
---
I started in the Eve beta and have been in an out of the game ever since.
---
Cruise missile Blackbird was my favorite!
---
Also miss mines, while they sucked they were great for trolling people. ie: Leave station, drop mines on exit and redock before anyone hits them.
---
I haven't spoken to PGL or Durr in years, so I don't remember who is who.
---
Thanks for the tip

You can only multifit 30 ships at a time.... so... big effort

Then tie in an Asset Safety module for citadels, again only installable at a Corp HQ and only provides AS to corp members.

Now, that would incentivize more corps and breaking the 1000+ person corp.

---
When not living in a Yurt and streaming Netflix on your phone is the bar.
---
People are buying isk from botters because it's cheaper than the legal market. Botting already has a fixed cost: electricity + hardware amortization. Imagine having a variable cost as well that you can't influence: time lost to staying safe + ships lost. If the cost of botting doubles, illegal isk will be at the same value as the legal isk. Guess what people are going to buy.

Pretty sure it was even posted on reddit

Not unsimple isn't not the opposite of the eve way.

Nice read! Well worded and you brought your message across very well. As for the content, I also have to agree. I expected the move to be chaotic at best and extremely costly and time consuming at worst.

Then I moved all my assets in two afternoons and sold the rest. Amazingly simple, and not a single ship died.

So first of all the game can be played for free now (with some limits). So give it a shot as a free player and see if you like it now. There's definitely been improvements made from "years ago." So you might like it now.
---
And there is definitely room for new players. There's plenty of corporations (guilds) that specialize in new players and even some corporations that don't specialize in new players are sometimes willing to take new players and train them up. I actually think the latter is the best option for new players, but that's just imho. Either way, there's definitely room for you in the game
---
Soooo this has been on my mind since ECM went to shit (also thank bob): It is indeed a permajam if the jammed target is beyond their lock range. Hence ECM may be brought somewhat back to life (when it comes to midslot jams, not drones) with a sensor damp + locking range script + possible light damp range bonus for Ewar hulls. Sure you need to sacrifice a mid to achieve, but I think its way better than just using a jam hull from within lock range.

Do...do you work for CCP?

---
It's only profitable in nullsec.
---
Sadly.
---
Almost nothing can be made profitably in highsec.
---
It's really hard to take progods politics seriously for more than a minute or two once you've done it a few times
---
&gt; Particularly non-mining oriented players who relied on ratting ticks just to get by.... these people IMO will be hit the hardest, pressured the fastest... and may go to faction warfare or other LP-sources for isk making
---
Or they can make better, safer money by going to highsec and doing trig content. Or w-space and make good money still with less risk/interruption than lowsec.
---
That will be after the first rorqual lands in a belt..

Why wouldn't you just use a damp bonused ship?
---
I dont see why they couldnt make a modual that activates local chat,it has always seemed silly to me that they were implying the major empires of eve (amarr, gallente, etc) for some reason maintained infrastructure in null sec where they claim they have no influence. 
---
Now i get why there have to be stargates but why local?
---
The installer script is a little outdated now (1 month), but I just submitted a new version which is pending for mod approval. The new will enable DXVK and ESYNC for you during instalment.
---
The Vulcan-ICD has to be set manually since it depends on the GPU card you use. Right click the game in lutris, go to system options and set the loader for your card.
---
&gt;Installer that you linked uses older launcher version, \[...\]
---
The older laucher will download the newer one.
---
&gt;\[...\] after install it just displays tray icon and nothing happens.
---
Make sure you don't start the launcher after instalment. Uncheck 'start laucher' on the end of the installer. The Lutris Installer needs to setup the env after the evelaucher is installed. When the little Console window closed your good to launch the game. If the evelaucher is getting stuck, you can kill all the wine processes through the lutris launcher too.
---
&gt;\[...\] the performance is abysmal (turning camera towards sun and anomaly overlay instantly cuts fps in half).
---
I had to set my cpu governor to 'performance' to fix this when running the 64bit client with dx11. You can change this with the 'cpupower' tool.
---
scenario: dps orbit at 500m, ewar at range. in this case your DPS ships are lockable, even under heavy damps. Light damp + jam in this scenario = permajam. 
---
\^\^ This is the case I am referring to.
---
Well, to be fair, intentional stupidity often leads to some of the best content.
---
So if SC ever came out, you could theoretically buy in for like $50 and never pay a subscription fee. Then your first day, you could join a pirate group and steal whatever ship you wanted to fly... and then just fly it and use all of its capabilities, since there's no skill system.
---
In EVE, on day one you could PLEX to a or whatever ship you wanted... arguably, EVE is worse in terms of P2W.

---
I just heard a flushing noise
---
The sound of your posting
---
&gt;However, why do people bot? People don't just feel like botting just to have a shit load of isk. The same people who bot are also more than likely selling it for real money, or better known as performing RMT.
---
This is nothing more than conjecture, and should be regarded as such. If you haven't spent time botting and talking a lot with other botters, you shouldn't be placing ANY value on your conceptions of why botters bot, or what they're doing with their isk. 
---
Some people bot to RMT. Some people bot because they want to get isk without doing what they consider to be tedious tasks. Some people bot purely because they take satisfaction in cheating. Some people do it because they enjoy the act of creating the script or botting tool itself. 
---
Your attempts to lump them all together into one category (RMT) is frankly quite silly. Don't mistake what I'm saying; botting has no place in eve, and the fewer bots there are, the better. But your analysis of the situation is as flawed as a 14 year old boy trying to give advice to women on going through menopause.
---
Or just firesale all your old stuff and get new stuff at your new home. I clould never be bothered to move much of anything in these sorts of situations.

They can be but why keep them logged in and AFK right now deploying this old strategy of locking down systems with the AFK cloaky?
---
With a delayed local every system is assumed to have enemy eyes in it anyway.
---
To be honest, it’s not that dumb.
---
Tomorrow all they’ll have to do is login at any point of ratting/mining
---
Random theory that they are working on the chat system back end and needed to do a part server shut down to finally fix chat.
---
Nice read
---
Tomorrow when the change goes live, they will be in the systems and don't have to risk being seen at gates.
---
Are you talking about the super pilot not being able to cyno up? Because if he's AFK enough to get bumped off he's probably not going to anyway.
---
If you're talking about the attackers then a 75km + docking ring exclusion zone would still let you drop dreads well within weapons range.
---
r/iamverysmart
---
Find a nearby exploration career agent, and travel to that system. They have tons of super easy sites you can scan down and hack (but no reward for doing so) if you want to "practice" on TQ in safety. 
---
Otherwise, SISI is your best bet as others have already said...besides just going out and trying for real.
---
unless they push it beyond summer i doubt it will. its summer so most people dont play, and many believe it wont go beyond july. so there will be cries but people just wont login and stay away and then come back in august
---
i mean its great thing to do, but there is a reason why they do it in summer when player numbers are low anyway. they dont wanna risk too many players not ever logging back, because in winter there would be too many people who might get burned by this
---
ou well lets see how it goes :)
---
i'm talking about the droppers that wouldn't be able to cyno on the target super
---
&gt; the parts that are impossible to bot?
---
Impossible to bot is not a thing. The statement itself lends only to a lack of understanding or creativity. With a combination of image and text recognition, and sufficiently complex logic, botting can perform any task humans can. It's simply an equation of whether the effort to make the script to bot the task is worth the reward.
---
so, because there will be no local tomorrow means there arent any targets worth dropping today? what?
---
You're breathtaking &lt;3
---
So can I get some ISK and a bit less politics  
---
And get back to the PVP and blowin' up ships
---
In CCP games, no one will hear you
---
Reload all is R.  Anyone who leaves it as ctr+r or changes it to something else is wrong.
---
So why have them all AFK now in local?
---
1. Find an Upwell structure (they are everywhere)
---
2. target
---
3. hack.  
---
4. fail and repeat step 3
---
But, you're skills may just suck.
---
Probably setting up for tomorrow. I’m gonna do the same thing once I get home today
---
I did include this one! :) [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77719870/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77719870/)
---
Thanks! :)
---
How do you think this is a problem for botters? It's easy for them to see when a new signature appears in their pocket. Also easy for them to safe up, while a ship probes the sig just enough to see if it's a wormhole. There are some hazards they won't be able to easily protect themselves from, wormholes aren't one of them, thanks to new signatures being instantly announced.
---
Thanks! Yeah I've an alt in PH. Wasn't a whole ton to move but it was pretty easy.
---
I'm questioning why you would lock down all the systems with AFK cloakies today.
---
I just moved two ships and that was it, I often sell what I'm not using.
---
Thanks! Indeed they don't. I've a new appreciation for them after seeing the wheels turning the past few days.
---
OMG Check the pings!!!!1!
---
Dreddit.  There are 5 ops on the forum over the next day, and our most active subcap doctrines are now using Scimis.
---
Or just leave it all, then always wonder why you have no ISK but your net worth tracker says tens of billions.
---
Wormhole opens, new signature pops up, botters start warping off before wormholers jumping through the hole can even start initiating warp.
---
So the second paragraph applies
---
The first 3 will work great. Wormholes are signatures, which are announced through agency or w/e, meaning they're VERY easy for botters to counter against.
---
Yeah. Not only am I the fool in the article who has moved his assets, I also have a few days of ripping down and resetting up PI ahead of me. 
---
I asked at EVE North about a templates for PI during the AMA. A few of the Devs thought it was a good idea. I really wish it's in the game now. 
---
As much as a pain in the ass hauling that many assets was, resetting up my PI is the real thing I dread now.
---
Local. We dont need no stinking local
---
Clockwork elves were replaced with Machine Elves. Upgraded, you might say.
---
Meta-macros.
---
3k ships thats like what? 300clicks? ever ratted in a carrier? 300clicks are nothing. hell, even updating your pi on a single toon should come close to that amount of clicks...
---
Can confirm. TEST comms can cause multiple different diseases.

The answer is PAPs.
---
&gt; Utterly hilarious and wasteful idiocy.
---
We got you, fam
---
a good example from last month was when i warped into a ceptor sabre falcon drag bubble with my retribution. Had to bounce between the sabre and falcon due to me being scrammed/webbed plus jams. Managed to kill falcon and sabre with my assault frig before the ceptor ran. Damps would not have prevented me from killing the sabre at close range in any case. Jams at range plus a damp would have had the desired affect this lad was after and he wouldn't have gotten egg on his face xD

ProGod did nothing wrong.

haha apparently that guy is an "FC" for the "Bergmann Empire", that must be a real powerhouse right thar.
---
There is a lot you can do with manufacturing. Some people I know do capital manufacturing in lowsec, mined ore needs to go somewhere and people are always getting capitals blown up.
---
As for highsec. Well that depends what you want. If you want super simple, then manufacturing some T1 modules (10/20 Blueprint original, BPO or a Blueprint Copy, BPC with high amount of runs recommended) which is simple as get mineral -&gt; manufacture -&gt; sell for profit.
---
As for something more complex but still simple. You could try building citadels, higher price tractor units/mobile depots, implants from BPC's etc.
---
Always preferrably put up buy orders in tax haven citadels next to Jita and remember to set buy range to 1 jump. If you need just a little bit of something and price difference between Buy &amp; Sell prices as a whole isn't a big one, then just save the effort.
---
Invention/T2 Production is lot more complex, but can also have higher profits due to the amount of T2 items like say Damage Control II's that are used. It really depends a lot on where you get your materials, where you build them, how many you can produce, where to sell for what price etc.
---
BPO's also do not drop if you have your build orders in Citadels. Even if they are being built from.
---
I was thinking two weeks as well :D

3000/30=100 not 300..
---
so multifitting ships 100times is somewhat equal to updating pi on a single toon...
---
def not ''a big effort''
---
Damn, you must be awesome to be around at parties and shit!
---
youve put enough effort to do the math.  try hard.
---
:'D all da crabs rofl
---
yes the spawn rates are terrible an most sites are trash plus people like me will be waiting to hunt them if they havn't been caught by a gate camp already, its basically suicide the only real reliable isk generation in low is from high quality moons that most pvpers cant even be arsed to mine.
---
making isk in lowsec isnt really a thing unless you have a good moon or a pocco empire i cant see the average null pve player being able to make it here
---
because accounts don't spontaneously combust at downtime, and won't be seen taking gates tomorrow
---
A) why do it today?
---
Solid, will check out
---
And that's how you get hundreds of billions in assets that are spread all over the galaxy!
---
It brought them in but they were almost all lost within 30 days. It was a significant topic of discussion for the CSM. CCP showed us the stats, and while B-R was a fantastic recruiter, it was awful in terms of retention
---
Yeah, because it's really hard to send a periodic message in local chat to show up in the user list intentionally to show their presence. They'll surely never think of doing such a thing!
---
Why would they want to do that?
---
Something went fucky I would think. Force close the client and restart it?
---
This is a lot like that "How to fight a bear with brazilian jiu jitsu" image.
---
Interesting. I always found the structure game a good draw for smaller corps, so it's nice to hear the entry level upwells are cheap enough to maintain and fuel. It's probably for the best technically and logistically to just have a larger structure that you fit out than the old POS system, but I will say I'll miss the stupid scattering of anchors in the bubble a bit. o7
---
I’ve done that a lot..
---
Yeah, but a damping boat will always do a better job, since damps aren't RNG.
---
Dude I'm glad you didn't kill Over. Poor guy is just doing his job
---
Holy fuck you're dense.
---
Go youtube and look up "rule of six" - seeing someone else do it is beat practice
---
Just when it was getting good too!!
---
I see what what you mean. I have used a single damp on a jamgu before to beat another jamgu, but I don't think giving ECM ships a bonus to a system that another race uses is a fair balance to Gallente. 
---
Pretty bad for the falcon pilot to get himself tackled though :) nice job
---
Sorry, not downloading a keylogger to my computer fam
---
Now, we never have to worry about this guy running for CSM. Others have been bared for less.
---
OOF
---
Why wouldn't they do it today? They know they are there now. Tomorrow they will not know where they are, how many, or whether they've cyno'd in 200 bombers to any given system regardless of how populated.
---
so they get seen and ppl are more scared and talk about them? just like you made a reddit thread about that so it worked!
---
why wait if you can move your campers today already and maybe get some content out of it? there is no reason not to

Because you either want to be seen and make everyone dock, or you want to not be seen and kill people. You can't do both.

Ah yes the joyous sizzle and the cleansing it brings the heretic is a gift from the Emperor. I see myself as a purist thou, the pleasing *thud* of a mass reactive is something that give me hope for future.
---
The same reason they cloaky camp with immediate local, so people know they are there and change their gameplay based on the fact that they know someone is in system with them that they can't find (and could jump on them at any moment). That's the entire point of cloaky camping, psychological warfare. Hence why if the local only shows them in the list when someone says something in chat, then cloaky campers need only say something when they enter system (and periodically so that new people in the system also see their presence).
---
very good fight regardless of the narrative from SG perspective. I am from avdot so give some information to clear it on the other side.
---
Avdot ends the contract with FRT at the end of June and moves back to lowsec because XIX gave up Rorq mining during +8 TZ and the content was exhausted extremely. We reset the whole WinterCo including SG. Our staging is next to SG's staging so no doubt the conflicts heat up.
---
 we dropped the mach and FAX to attack SG's Athanor and they formed leshak to defend. then both dropped REVs ( both sides have very high thermal and EM resistence so it is hard to kill each other quickly), so avdot decided to drop a few NAGs to add some explosive damage and this was really effective.)Then SG dropped titan/supers to dd our NAGs(very good reaction, otherwise their Rev would die soon). thus, we log in the supers and dropped as well ( YOU JUMP! I JUMP!) both dreads were dead quickly but avdot started to take the advantage and tried to tackle SG's BUS. SG wrapped most of their supers but their subcap fleet made efforts to kill our HICs to rescue their BUS. We only had two HICs on grid so all the maches changed to warp scramblers to keep enough points on BUS. Since both side had very equivalent numbers and power on grid, we determined to inform BBC and told them we temporarily tackled a BUS and honestly told them we were very hard to kill it, then they started forming and moving. in the meanwhile, SG dropped a few FAXs beside the BUS and BUS was trying to move away from our dreads' range. our maches had to keep the warp points on BUS so flew away from our FAXs and be killed fast. After all two HICs and a few maches were dead, we could not tackle it anymore so BUS warpped out successfully. two mins later, BBC arrived on grid and SG retreat their subfleet. in the end, avdot destroyed the Athanor.
---
 
---
 a few clarifications:
---
 1. we didn't batphone anyone, otherwise, I don't think SG would take the risk to drop their supers. BBC's issue was explained in above desc.
---
 2. we didn't want to drop the supers initially (we didn't even login them). Looks like both of us dropped supers based on the escalation of the battlefield situation (i think countering NAGs is the flashpoint).
---
 3. I believe a lot of batphones would happen after this brawl. It is always an issue for lowsec brawl, especially for the final timer.
---
 4. lowsec is not dead. thanks, everyone.
---
Brave of you to assume that I can generate PvP loot.

Ahhh.... early macros.... these multicolored things of beauty used to roam keyboards everywhere.  Varying in size shape and color.  They were eventually killed off by technology, once again moving entire species to extinction...

So glad they gave heads up...and kind of shocked folks weren't locking down entry in the South and East this week. Between myself Corp and Allies and Frienemies  we have about 30 systems already seeded with CovOps Cyno and Cyno alts.
---
Curse is ready....are you?
---
So why move here at the time of backout or it's a coincidence?
---
In nullsec, you will no longer be able to see who's in local unless they speak.

---
Thinking about moving my orca alt to a new account and subbing it...but I'm also afraid I'll open Pandora's box of subbing. I've only ever had one account since 2013 lol
---
Yeah, that article was well done. The one thing it didn't truly capture was historical perspective, beyond Testament saying they've had a lot of practice at this. The move to Geminate from Fade wasn't exactly a smooth one, as a Mach fleet got waterboarded early on, forcing leadership to route many subsequent move ops through wormholes. And the cap move was one-way, leaving a lot of people without enough suitcases to move all their hulls. A lot of stuff got self-destructed in front of the 7X Keepstar as as result.
---
The local chat systems in all of null sec are going to be switched over to work like wormhole chat (i.e. you cannot see who is in system unless they talk)
---
You can read more about it here: 
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/pufecw/48-hour-warning-nullsec-local-blackout
---
Cause you see them now, so you know they will be there tomorrow, and more active than you know.
---
It surely has nothing to do with the fact that there was a recent sale on PLEX and 50% off DLC packs (that also contained PLEX).
---
Also probably a fair few skill farmers bought tons of it when the dip happened because it will make their profit margin on skill injectors that much higher come next extraction cycle.
---
Why not just get rid of invuln timers and have it 100% vulnerable at any point?
---
This week has been an extremely enlightening peek into the minds of players so coddled with carebear mentality that they don't have the slightest clue how PvP works.
---
im genuinely hoping youre trolling
---
Then you structure would get attacked at 3am in the morning.
---
I see absolutely no problem with that.
---
Do you want to get a fleet ping at 3am?
---
I'm not making any judgement about playstyles or grrgon or whatever, I'm just saying the battle of B-R didn't have any measurable effect in increasing subscriptions. It attracted masses of attention, but that attention very quickly faded, for reasons that are more or less obvious. I'm sorry you don't like facts, but there they are.
---
Yay U'K :D
---
Another reason to exterminate tapi
---
Sure why not. Timezone tanking is literally worse than a 0300 fleet ping.
---
Clockwork elves is a bigotted euphemism for chinaman.

Am so confused about this post not being a shit post but an actual thing that you made... that i still believe this is one hell of a shitpost. Like shitpostception 
---
My mind right now is like local tommorrow ...
---
lol at having pings set up to the point where it controls your life
---
just mute pings
---
Not all people who use cloaking devices are cloaky campers. Also, people regularly setup log-ins a few days in advanced. So now when local drops, they can hunt without being seen coming through a gate and alerting anyone who's got cloaky alts watching said gate. They can hunt in perfect secrecy until they uncloak and cyno in a dread bomb.
---
Or they're just going to cloaky camp and say shit in chat to make sure people know they are still there, who knows.
---
dscan doesn't help when 12au/s sabres land on you in about 2 seconds and bubble up. Not to mention the 2s delay between dscans now
---
What a great movie!
---
Because people actually use the terrible default keybinds
---
Have regions based on timezone, where the more activity the region gets the larger the timezone boundary spreads.     
---
For example the regions of Prontera, Valkyrie and Britoniah would have their timers all EUTZ, Geffen, Payon and Balder would be USTZ, Aldebaran is RUTZ and Luina is AUTZ.    
---
Say Luina gets far more USTZ activity than Balder over a period of time, its timers then slowly shifts from USTZ to AUTZ.
---
That depends on how many pilots you have for an ewar wing.  Unbonused isn't the best, but in this case it's good enough.
---
The point is that your space will get trashed if people don’t wake up at 3am. You certainly don’t have to wake up at 3, but somone will
---
Too lazy, but imagine I posted a screenshot of recon description, and their dscan immunity gets zoomed in menacingly
---
I just applied to horde lol
---
I wonder what happened to him in order to derive so much putrid contempt for the pastoral nomads of the world.
---
Why is defending a structure at 3 more fun than attacking one at 3?
---
Not at all. Goons are today adopting tactics that rely on local being in place.
---
Because it's something to do.
---
It's when the electricity goes out and things like lights, kitchen appliances, computers and local don't work.
---
Ok, so it shouldn't have a massive effect
---
If secrecy is their game then why stay logged in in all systems now?

&gt; Since both side had very equivalent numbers and power on grid, we determined to inform BBC
---
&gt;we didn't batphone anyone
---
I feel like i'm missing something here.  Also, how memes it is that you actually concede that you reach out to snuff _because_ the fight was so even.  Nice.
---
Great write up ! Thanks
---
The point stands though; a cloaked ship on grid should be giving zero information about it to any other client on that grid until it decloaks. This isn't related to chat in any way.
---
Yeah I don't envy you that. PI templates would be absolutely glorious. On the flip side, it'd also make it easier to get into &amp; less profitable...

is batphone a kind of "pre" action? oh , maybe we are not on the same page, i am sorry to make you confused.

---
Assuming that you are a newbie and are not trolling me here, it will actually have quite a big effect. Having perfect intel on where hostile pilots are has been the backbone of null money-making, allowing anyone with half a brain (or a bot with about 5 lines of code lol) to know whether or not it is safe to eat/mine. Without local it is almost impossible to know if there are hostile pilots in system with you unless they make themselves known.
---
I don't really think batfoning someone is restricted to something you set up and plan beforehand.  Also, weren't you guys in BL with me when _we worked with snuff in hopes of killing sggrn titans?_   Do you not remember how that ended for us? I cannot begin to understand why you would call snuff to help you, especially when you have supers and titans on grid.

didnt you post this already? it was shit before btw

It will have an enormous impact for most long time nullsec residents, but many new players aren't going to care.
---
Longtime nullbears (pve players who live in nullsec empires because it's safer than anywhere else) rely on intel gathered from the list of players in the local chat to know when to get safe to avoid being ganked. For them this is a huge deal. Hunters love it for obvious reasons. But if you're new and still learning the mechanics then it'll have a minimal impact on your day to day life.
---
Lachesis with 2x Faction Warp Scramblers?
---
Needs more fade to black.
---
yo someone fuck my killboard up with ventures thanks pls i dont wanna krab
---
Forgot about multifit. Still only 30 at a time but yeah true. 
---
I don’t use multifit much. I make components, not the finished product. Otherwise I fit one ship at a time as I need them.
---
Good though last time I was there was a real fun time ^^
---
You ***MONSTER***!
---
I Titan rat because 300 clicks is cancer :P
---
Rendered with Windows 95 Movie Maker.
---
As someone who’s area is always being griefed by Stain, I totally expect them to drop dreads tomorrow.
---
Yeah that's fine for the odd hunter but if 90% are just normal traffic can bots detect that and just still make decent isk
---
Was just a thought
---
There are dscan bots, so yes, they can dscan
---
Tip: they aren't afk.
---
Oh, ok. Is it a temporary thing or what?
---
Bots can D-Scan but Cov Ops and Recon are either invulnerable or can warp cloaked. 
---
Most likely though anyone who actually checks their bots or EVE news will be keeping them docked until Blackout ends.
---
What was your in game name? I wonder if I ever flew with you
---
So why aren't they BLOPsing?
---
And what makes you think those will actually be AFK? 
---
Sorry to break this to you, but some Goon SIGs will definitely roam around TKE for as long as this lasts.
---
Next time, please try to engage your brain before accusing others of not being very bright.
---
F1
---
We're not actually sure, CCP has been silent on that. Best guess is that it's temporary for the Invasion event but a lot of us are treating it as if it's permanent just in case.
---
When ur question is so dumb people think it trolling lol
---
Hell ye :D
---
Did you explain to him that it is impossible for you to be dumb, you play eve.
---
Not everyone who tries eve will stay. No matter how much you pander to them.
---
  I maintain my point that rolling fleets of rorqs parked on rocks doesn't increase player numbers either. Protecting their interests does nothing for player retention oflr player increase. except for more krab alts.
---
ProGodLegend Leader of the KKK?
---
Nah, I’m pretty sure I’m dumb because of that reason.
---
I think an unfit astra is a little under a bil, although the fittings can get expensive if you want it to be useful in combat. If you just want a clone bay it’s not expensive at all
---
&gt; making isk in lowsec isnt really a thing unless you have a good moon or a pocco empire i cant see the average null pve player being able to make it here
---
what the fuck, lowsec has some of the best individual ISK you can make........
---
Im not sure a brain is there to engage judging by his responses to everyone
---
Yeah haha was going to say, could go either way I guess.
---
didn't read any comments or full post; anyone saying no is a pussy
---
Autumngale
---
Ahh yes, i remember that. Ive been talking to Sebastyian recently, I think you can figure out why.
---
I'm not gone yet dipshit or did you just stop reading after the first line in your rush to post?
---
Indeed
---
When I opened to client this morning there was a link to the scope video, a link to the patch notes and a link to the previous announcement all mentioning the blackout and loss of local. Unless they are blind they know.
---
Building a new PC to get back into Eve. Will be running a Ryzen 5 3600 on a B450 Tomahawk with 16gb of RAM. 
---
Can someone recommend a graphics card for me? I want to run up to four clients in full graphics. 
---
hey dude, Avdot was not involved in that incident (bz of timezone problem) so don't put "hat" on us. We did well when we were in BL. Nobody in BL blames or criticizes avdot's contribution and achievement. you should take some lesson from elo on what AVDOT did when BL deployed in north and the Branch campaign.  
---
in addition, Both D&amp;G and AVDOT left BL already so there is no reason I need to listen to your preaching and teaching of how to work with others. 
---
some people hate BBC, some people hate Goons, or maybe some people hate you. hate is a mood that always exists. but, just don't let hate blind our eyes.
---
Cynoing shit on top of ratters doesn't need local.
---
Not to mention, if they wanted to be visible on local, they can be.
---
That make sense.
---
Who the hell are you. You're not even in fedup nor were you in fleet. The other side didn't want to show. Okay, so why are you saltier than the people that actually showed up?
---
If it ends
---
If you are good enough at probing, your target will not see the probe until you are making a single final pass on them. The secret is to master D scanning so you can reliably fire probes at the tightest possible formation within a 5 degree angle, after firing them and moving them are outside the solar system.
---
I was Omega awhile back but left the game for a few years. Currently playing as an Alpha.
---
I've got a lot of skills in drones and I was wondering what might be the next step in PVE after a Vexor? I primarily do lowsec pve with and was thinking of throwing in a bit of null and wh pve as well. My Vexor is really tough enough for some of the harder sites.
---
So whats the next step after the Vexor? VNI? Myrmidon? Thanks!
---
"elite pvpers" show up in null. 
---
"Derp.. Hey.. herrrrp. Where'd all da miners and ratters... DERRRRP! Go??? HERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR"
---
You are one *dense motherfucker*.
---
Yep, already seen a bunch of folks leave for Snuffed so that they can krab in lowsec. I don't know what to think about that.
---
&gt;REEEEEE CCPLSSSSSS
---
I honestly think this could have potential after a few rounds of feedback and tweaking.
---
My big suggestion is to work on the UI to organize the results by type. Ships in one spot, citadels+stations+pos in another, wrecks in a third, miscellaneous in another. Might be worth some kind of special interest category for bubbles and wetus so they don't get mixed in with MTUs and cans.
---
Second thing that would be useful is showing when/what stuff disappears from dscan. That's a strong indicator of activity.
---
perfect you can yell on comms AND tell them what tackled you at the same time. :)
---
Replace all rocks with Mercoxit, and bring back "Spodzilla"
---
&gt; They can be but why keep them logged in and AFK right now deploying this old strategy of locking down systems with the AFK cloaky?
---
To make sure you know they're there, before the blackout?
---
Oh, I didn't even think about big game, more like Isktars and shit, but yeah I suppose you can briefly hold a super with a recon too.
---
This has to be satire right?
---
Because it's the smart thing to do before the blackout, tomorrow.
---
*jumps stargate*
---
  EXPLOSIONS AND SHIT DYING
---
Your contributions to BL when we were there together, and the fact that both DnG and AVDOT are no longer in BL is irrelevant.  I'm simply pointing out that working with snuff to kill supers, when you have supers committed, is a 20 IQ move.  You don't have to wake my word for it.  Just ask literally anyone that has put themselves in that situation... like Elo for example...
---
its cool though because the drifters will kill the sabre
---
Hey, don't insult us carebears like that. We know how this shit works, or we die by it.
---
Gotta be a DBRB alt with this idiotic attempt at misdirection
---
Take your choice of thread, there are *very* clearly people that don't know haha
---
the fact that this is pretty long and with full comms makes it really, really good for learning small gang stuff if you're new to that kind of gameplay
---
lots of things to pick up from this like communication about how points/webs/damps/dps/etc. are spread and applied and a lot of talk about positioning as well as defanging for the keres (because it's super vital to keep keres on grid in fights like this)
---
nice video!
---
The forums hasn't been the same since they got rid of the original ones.
---
There is a HUGE gap between what zkb provides and what local provides.
---
That is spectacular.
---
I am fine you have your stand and hypothesis. We are all adults so we have the capability to commit what we do respectively. 
---
o7. best regards to D&amp;G and fly safe.
---
If your just starting to deal with what jspace dwellers have felt with all along.
---
What’s the blackout?
---
I played eve for ten years and quit because real life called to me, but still follow this sub.
---
Wow, so much originality. I am Stricken so hard. I must retreat.
---
What is? Using local to scare people?
---
Same I use 4 to talk and 5 to scan!
---
Running fleets against OP broken aimless AI while getting literally nothing in return unless you have the fastest ship on grid...
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/pu69gy/nullsec-local-blackout-incoming-during-july
---
Local is being removed in nullsec.... It will be delayed like wormholes and you will only show up if you speak first.
---
Does it hurt?
---
I just want some sort of auto-routing.   
---
A checkbox on a storage unit that says: Whatever a connected factory wants, I will give to them.
---
He can do what he wants, but missions and mining in hisec quickly get repetitive. Some people might enjoy it, but I believe for most it's the fastest way to lose interest in the game.
---
It’s just uninformed, the issue with null intel is ongoing, the blackout, the Drifters and Triglavians are the start of fundamental mechanic changes to combat some things endangering the game world.
---
the IRONY is that he advocated for something that is now a nightmare for him. For something to be unironic, he would have to have done this knowingly as a joke, knowing that it would effect him negatively
---
Lol, pretty edgy.  Obviously this is just typical fucked up bacon bar sperg though.
---
You really are thick as shit.
---
I thought wormholers were proud of the life they chose.. Now you're just idiots who are limiting your reach and hiding.
---
I'd love to chat with the PI guy, I help run a pretty large PI operation in TEST, and would love to compare notes.
---
Dude have you ever been to Delve cos really just really.
---
PM me a discord handle &amp; I'll pass it along :)

Missing the Hel who failed to dock in time and got dread bombed resulting in 70b  in ships dieing in the resulting brawl :p
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/30002472/201907072100/
---
Apparently the FC called to "Primary the Hel" when there were two of them on grid so they split DPS. Might've been able to kill both if he had realized sooner.
---
DHD is awsome
---
oh yeah cloak means your fucked. *aligned out but stopped,* means when you hit the mjd it locks you in the alignment to your safe, or you end up mjding the wrong way
---
I've been reading a lot of William Gibson.
---
They are movinv ? What did i miss ???
---
can I dm you our private teamspeak info?  come chill with us bro.
---
Anything repetitive and annoying bots can do far more reliably than humans.  The idiots screeching about how bots will finally die are just shoving their heads in the sand so they can pretend they’re doing something good by killing people who can’t fight back.
---
Yes.  Bots can dscan
---
alot of clicks are always cancer^^ my point is, that it is nowhere near as much effort as you thought.
---
its infact equal if not easier to do than the most ''known'' cancerclicky shit in eve...
---
way to easy to ruin someones kb/annoy ppl with that if you ask me but hey....
---
Oh no, I’m planning on going out to play while everyone is freaking out and getting their bearings.
---
But I would already assume every system is camped w/ blockout.
---
You try roaming in a dominix, let alone getting through gate camps...
---
Wow.  I haven't don't hisec incursions in a long time, but I understand why it'd cause a bunch of REEEEEE.  I took a bit of a break from eve, it must have happened while I was away.  Too bad I missed all the salt.
---
Hey man, I'm doing a report on people who have never sexually pleasured a woman. Would you mind if I quote some of your posts?
---
Welcome to CCP's idea of everything working fine.
---
Wow that’s incredible
---
I'm sure it'll be real hard for botters to have a cloaky alt at every gate in their system to watch the gates and scan their overview to see who's coming and going. Greatly reducing any measure of cloaking or recon d-scan immunity. As soon as someone takes a gate and decloaks from the gate, the bots will have time to fuck off before they can be caught. Which would only leave wormholes or covert cynos as means of providing a chance at completely silent infiltration into a system.
---
Blops activity is going to now have 100% less local intel
---
This really makes me want to play again
---
People have money to lose.
---
To give some perspective, RMT (generally through botting) is around $3 per billion ISK. The star pack is DIRT CHEAP. And while this looks sus, I came across this when looking into botting.
---
GF slaver scum!  
---
Next time bring less fax and we´ll get into range ... I promise... really... I swear on your imaginary friend!

I always buffer mine.

Blackout is the 'fix' since they can't actually fix chat. 
---
Not broken if it's a 'feature'
---
Hello police? I would like to report a murder
---
Wingspan can deliver your payment in the form of torpedoes, just give them your location and stay in space Friday.
---
are you mentally challenged?
---
Funny part is that there are more of us than locals. I now know why they are removing local so no one realises that the place is a desert where supposed real alliances are.   
---
Today I have sent many a character into Kavala and only one gate was protected by 3 guys. 95% of the systems only had a goon in it. 2% had locals. We need more campers in Kavala to make it feel occupied. So disappointed. EVE is dying. So best hide it by hiding local.   
---
PS can anyone lend me a cup of sugar I forgot it back in Delve.
---
Good shit boys, well done.
---
You misunderstand.
---
We *enjoy* a hard game. Just like how nullseccers used to.
---
Gonna have to watch those episodes again tonight
---
I just want Squadron 42, the Star Sitizen single player game. With how broken the main game is tho I can't see it happening soon :(
---
Come back BB. support postive change.
---
Someones gotta go back and get a shit load of jump fuel!

Yeah this will make Nullsec more interesting. I might resub myself.

I don't think this means what you think it means.
---
I am the exact opposite of risk adverse actually. Brawl or gtfo.
---
Sounds like a fun brawler, I’ll have to give it a shot since my drone skills are way better than my gunnery
---
I think it's a popular way to quit the game. Liquidate all you assets, and fill your cargo hold with plex and injectors and go die.
---
Even better yet dscan doesn't help when the cloaked sabre decloaks and drops a bubble where your not is programmed to warp.
---
PAP?!
---
Did someone say PAP??
---
No really, nobody cares, fuck off.
---
Fucking dingleberry
---
Definitely the myrmidon, I'd say. It would the the Vexor Navy Issue, but their drone bonuses are getting nerfed soon.

Thanks for this. I like it.

Thanks for the quick response! I didn't know the VNI was getting nerfed. Any idea on what kind of fit I should use?

Sounds like Goon's NGSA sig (National Goon surveillance agency, which Boat often talks about on The Meta Show).  They provide cynos and targets for the other Goon combat sigs.

Where are these rorquals you speak of... More Grrr goons than PH.

Hide the absence of pilots by removing local to make they all feel like their numbers are real.

the irony
---
Trash
---
This is as dumb as the other post, the Blackout is getting rid of local but it seems to be also getting rid of people's brain cells too
---
I dont get this
---
This will be the best way, as you can do it safely in highs ec for as long as you want, and even choose your difficulty by hacking different sized structures.
---
You could be really good at STO.

You’d need more than 6 points. It’s + 5 per level for supers

How can I set up a pos the ones with the forcefeild to do industry? I want to do manufacturing in my corps wormhole it's just I am the only one who wants to currently and the stations are to exspensive I'm in a c5. I mainly just want to make my own ships and ammo so I dont have to bring it in. And modules also.
---
You should read the description of warp core strength on a super. You know, on the traits section where it shows bonuses.
---
discord/LSUterusfailures right?
---
Durr is an actually nice dude, his voice can just be super grating. That should be enough info.
---
You think you're spying on everyone, but in fact it's the other way around.
---
Are you wilfully stupid, or does it just come to you naturally?
---
POSes were a pain in the butt if you were the guy who had to manage a dozen of them for your corporation, but otherwise they were great. Citadels are basically too good, it shouldn't be that easy to plop your own station anywhere. I don't like the effect they've had on the game. 
---
And they don't kill people. 
---
And they're way too annoying to kill. Everyone complained about how annoying it was to bash POSes, so CCPs reaction was to make it even more annoying to kill citadels. Don't really get that.
---
next time you should use the glorious example that is Alabama, my home state, and what happened when we decided to grrr immigration and kick out all the immigrants - I'll give you a clue: agriculture + failure - 6,000,000,000(+/-) tax revenue.

Wingspann, don't expect much ;)

DUDE, This is LSU's year.  This is our best team since 2011, maybe even better than that one.  We goin to the ship.
---
they could make it so that you could sell via contract existing setup in a area, K space i mean. then again even WHs have insurance on ship these days so who knows
---
I just came back after 5 years away. What changed with ECM? I used to love flying blackbirds :(
---
Especially these days
---
Program something that hits "V" every second, something pops up and initiate "warp to"

yeah I nuked it cause it’s a shit meme

Tbf this tactic has been used for a long time, albeit with logging the sabre/tackle off in site.
---
If free ISK is Valkorsia's Inner Hell, I don't ever want to go to heaven.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
What DScan doesn't tell you is if the ship on scan is blue or not, compared to local being able say if a new player is "friendly" or not.
---
Sylnn you need to get over this. This level of salt and angst over a videogame isn't healthy have you considered seeing a professional?
---
Eve is a big place and TKE is large too plus horde not fully moved yet.
---
I don't understand why you think an alt in each system is a useful strategy when the locals can't even see local. U can't active hunt with that many chars.
---
And he's in Goons now ;) I'd suggest checking.
---
Some pockets in Drones have used this already for a while, albiet with pods burning away from gate not cloaked ships watching.
---
Definitely. I tried it with a *Runescape* a few years back. I hated it. And I like that game.
---
I'm curious how this will impact the new player experience.  I only started a few months ago.  I'm in the middle ground where cap/super ratting isn't possible, but I have multiple accounts for ratting.  All of my ratting is going on hold for the blackout and I've moved those accounts to abyssals.
---
I imaging most people will do something similar.  I can't see putting a VNI, Ishtar, or Domi out without intel. Maybe the alliance will pay people to put eyes on gates.  Otherwise the krabbing is all going to move to abyssals.  The people that get caught are mostly going to be newbies that haven't been learning who will quickly get frustrated that the meta has shifted to mutliboxing abyssals or cap/super ratting.
---
Wowowow, allow me to adjust the bar then :P
---
Ships being jammed can now target whatever is jamming them. Works with drones too.
---
I look forward to finding some more food in Black Rise if your prediction is correct.
---
Join a corp and avoid PHORDE, Brave, or whatever other nullsec newbie corp they tell you to join. Join a corp that will not funnel you into one of the big sov groups.

Try a wormhole corp, or something like EVE Uni even.
---
When shitppsting on reddit gets boring so you shitpost in game.
---
I heard someone joking about setting up camps... Look how far we've come.

Probably a good idea. He blobs with supers now not cloakies.

He hath ascended :pray:

What are you talking about? Every recording of Durr is a goldmine.
---
\+1 for the Police Squad reference.

Do it! Gather some friends and shitpost in virtual space.
---
oh god no
---
THEY MADE A TV SHOW?!?!?!?!?!
---
A random guy on the Internet is offended that another random guy on the Internet made a dumb post, so he made his own dumb post.
---
This has nothing to do with bots, you could not be more fucking wrong.
---
WAIT WE'RE MOVING!?!?!?

Read Sun Tsu

oh sibire... i told you to hold and be patient.

How long have you known me. 
---
Name *one* time I've done the smart thing.
---
WAIT WE'RE MOVING!?!?
---
unreal blight back in the old days
---
Depends on the ship, in all honesty. For things like frigates/destroyers it's usually more like three times, while if you regularly fly caps you can conceivably fly them without enough liquid ISK to replace them, because at that stage you can probably make up the ISK in a few days of krabbing.
---
Holy cow you are dumb. He owned it, made a promise. Then, he was about to get it smashed so struck a deal to save it, costing him controlling interest. He voted against raising the tax, but there are several other voting members and he was outvoted.
---
He is still has technical ownership, but he signed a treaty giving up ultimate control.
---
It is just like in real life. If Steve Jobs made a promise, but the board decided later to overrule him, that was that. Oh, and guess what, that happened lol.
---
Hell yea brother KKona
---
Sounds like good fun then
---
You can put in a petition through CCP. Some times they do special offers where the first month or two is discounted. But it does not stay discounted permanently. I don’t think I have heard of CCP discount any accounts due to income limitations, other than the F2P alpha accounts
---
Join MCAV, dude. mcav-public. We're a C5 wormhole corp without that kind of BS. No sitting around waiting for assembly, if content is in chain we go for it.
---
So if I just anchor a mobile warp disruptor with a scary name, that'll be enough to chase off the bots and keep 'em docked?
---
you need up to 25 points for a regular super, 30 points for a faction super, 50 points for a titan and 60 points for a faction titan.
---
Yeah, but a fleet of titans would be better.
---
Fuck if I know, never botted. But yeah I guess that would work unless they added some kind of exception. I'm sure it could evolve ya know.
---
you care enough to keep responding and I really appreciate that.
---
They usually have a separate salvage bot going behind them. I'm talking about shooting the wreck as soon as it's generated to make it appear as though you're not ratting
---
Heresy! Praise Bob, that He might deliver us from the dreaded hell that is Serenity! Praise Bob, that He might deliver His Drifters and His Sleepers to the unworthy of k-space, that they might be cleansed in His holy and forgiving light! Praise Bob, that He might cloud local and shield those in system from the attention of the krabs, lest they scatter before His righteous chosen few.
---
Praise be upon Bob!
---
So I don't get it...What's the point of jamming at all then if it doesn't do anything?
---
Nice write-up!
---
The contents of r/eve killed that myth long ago
---
Don’t believe you can even anchor the POS industry modules anymore. 
---
A raitaru with modules shouldn’t be that expensive for a c5 corp and it’s only about 400m a month in fuel for it. Surprised he corp doesn’t want to set that up unless this is a very small corp.
---
Your edits to the graph make absolutely no sense. As cost of playing increases, then what? Are you in BRAVE or something?
---
&gt; It is just like in real life. If Steve Jobs made a promise, but the board decided later to overrule him, that was that. Oh, and guess what, that happened lol.
---
This is exactly what i'm talking about, if he couldn't back it up he didn't really have the authority to make that promise to start with. Which is also a bad position to be in.
---
This little QOL change, adding a "Do not show me again" to the "Board my Corvette" window, would be a pretty great improvement.
---
Last I remember we were in pure blind and fade. How the times change
---
Well said.  I did enjoy the content you provided BL when we were both there together.  Good luck to you my friend. o7
---
6 or 7 days old public news now. Bad spai
---
Not sure if you have played this game in the last year, but it's changing. Simply put, you soon won't be able to play without Plex and "plexing" your sub will no longer be a thing.
---
Just hunt using the flavor of the month, noone will expect a VNI hunting other VNIs
---
fade to gem was painful, not as painful as uvho to fade. personally this move was fantastic compared to others. the guys involved really came together and , imo nailed it
---
The target cant lock anything BUT the ship jamming it. ECM  is now a martyrs tool, still super useful in the right situation
---
I now understand the meaning of Dino-brain
---
This was a super fun fight! Thanks for recording/sharing it with everyone Jokastis.
---
Another great sermon by Rev. Jesus Rambo.
---
And I'll say the same thing. Just because someone enjoys a different play style from yo u doesn't mean it's cancer.
---
we'll see - I'm actually shopping for some dank bama swag to wear on the Saturday of EVE Vegas for Arkansas game, I think they might be not shit this year
---
Yes but now you can't see the sabre in local. It takes a fraction of a second to decloak and drop a bubble that was set up a day ago, even faster than most people can dscan and warp. It takes seconds minimum currently between the time you appear in local and the time the bubble pops. For subs you can bait them into warping to a newly instabubbled structure or getting tackled in site. For carriers you can now bubble faster than they can warp off. The same tactic has been used for years but you usually knew to be a bit more careful and take precautions because you could see that they were around or warp off before they loaded grid during a login trap.
---
No, see I get what you were trying to say. Your graph edits are fucking stupid. The cost of playing should be Y and the X should have remained "Time Played" or whatever.
---
Amen
---
I don't expect special treatment just cause I got low funds, but I was hoping there was a way of paying in pounds instead of euro, like switching my country setting or something, but didn't see anything like that in my account settings.
---
Huh, well that's silly imo. Good thing I don't fly ECM I suppose.
---
holy shit, opsec wtf
---
Still same suggestion: Send a ticket to CCP and ask about it.
---
cringe
---
The same way you get on killmails as pods and freighters.
---
