---
Ideally you would want to had a m3 capacity approach. Displaying A&lt;-&gt;B splits between systems is done to death, so no gains there.. what always suffers in these systems is the hauling between the two.   
---
Lets for example say I'm doing a blockade runner between SystemA and SystemB and i have spare capacity in my cargo... fuck it, im willing to roll the trade dice here and try and make a little profit for the trip. This is where the trade tool hit their stride... price per jump, max load capacity etc.
---
Price + Hauling = Profit.

There is no one on this earth who hates goons more then deadtear.

&gt;have more experience with DirectX
---
DirectX12 is a completely different paradigm from Dx11.  In fact Dx12 and Vulkan are more alike than Dx11 and Dx12 are. 
---
So really I don't understand why if they had to switch API why not simply go for the one with more platform support.
---
With that much SP you could extract skills you dont use and be 6 feet under in isk
---
Im curious to find out more about the Triglavian lore too, and what they look like.  
---
I'm looking for advice on drone mechanics: Let's say I attack my opponent with combat drones. How much does his ship's speed influence the tracking/damage of my drones? Can I increase the damage by webbing him, or the other way around avoid part of his drones' damage by using an afterburner? Also I read that drones have a fixed orbiting speed (relative to the grid?). What happens when my opponent's ship exceeds that orbiting speed? Do the drones have to catch up periodically and thus miss some attacks?
---
The experience you get when shit pops off in EVE is well worth almost any price imo. The best experiences you can have in gaming. 
---
Still you can install a 32bit OS (even by mistake) and you are "reported" as a 32bit user.
---
Who do you think writes shitposts? Great writers?
---
And CCO would be happy cause they can downgrade the servers
---
Absolutely, yes. It's what I do. Bit of solo PvP, some fleet stuff, banter on comms, maybe a gate camp or defend the pocket, some PI (if I remember it exists), and logging on my spy alts or scam alts to cause some trouble or just stir the pot.
---
One more step on the road to "buerocrats online"
---
I think the RP community exist, just not in the FW matters way. Everything is pretty much citadel defense fleets that prevent any proactive rp like taking systems, some sort of internal story where both sides collaborate. Pirate entities don't care if amarr and minmatar are working towards lore etc... 
---
How many loops have you listened too :|

 "people buy ISK from RMTers because it's easier to spend ¬£10 on 2B than spend 6-7 hours smashing out your super ratting" - sure that is why plex goes down on market,oh wait but it goes up? 
---
Creating pve instances to make EVE ratting "Lineage 2" CP system ,what a change!
---
And finally NullSec space is not really a place where you can farm diamond AI NPC bcos pirate gang will rape you together with diamond AI on anomaly everyday..."Welcome to the real world Neo..."
---
You start by not having best-in-slot pve items gated behind a pvp activity that pays out rewards primarily for showing up and winning, and not for performance?
---
No space should be safe for anyone. And newbies don't anchor their own structures. Anchoring a structure is now an act that declares: *I am ready to fight!*
---
Definitely simple. 
---
TFW you take roleplaying to the next level
---
Stores would be in NPC stations mate. And available to all. How is that confusing?
---
Welp, I dont think calling the reddit masses that flock to these threads "bitchbabies" indicates anything other than disdain, but if it makes you feel good to think I'm triggered or whatever that's fine.
---
The reason a lot of the older resources are gone is because CCP redid the external API and got rid of the old limited/full API keys. Then they redid it again to have a modern web api.
---
A lot of things broke and aren't likely to come back.

Botters that seem to be getting kills. Man, that's quite an upgrade. 
---
Yeah, That is one example but without AMD's optimisations on the software side. I have seen a few more that pin it somewhat higher, In the playable ranges but still have a huge performance gulf.
---
You seem very worried about losing ships.
---
You sure Eve is for you?
---
Good for solo roaming,  great for gang roams, great for anti-support in larger fleets. In null, they‚Äôre also useful because of their ability to fit a Defender launcher. 
---
Plus, the in-flight reconfiguration makes it beastly depending on the scenario. 
---
Yea if it fits heh.  They are technically oversized L guns.
---
We can go deeper!
---
These questions were answered pretty well in a recent post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/auvkk5/speed_tanking_drones/
---
Kind of in the same boat. I wanted to do small gang stuff but unfortunately Im not active enough for small corps and usually am asked to leave or just never am on at the right time to go do anything. I didnt want to be an F1 monkey but its seeming like best bet for content is joining a large corp. Any opinions? 
---
Hehe was a good fight bro always appreciate guys for content and give good fights üòçüòç
---
Even if it's based of performance bots would still stomp people. Some people do it just to "win." And people would still do it to get their "main" the "performance" (lets be real, a performance based reward system is subject to it's own problems as well.) rewards anyway.
---
Sure you might objectively de-incintivize botting, but you also do that for players aswell. I think the problem with that system is the fact of giving gear in the rewards in the first place. Even with only performance-based cosmetics you would still have people botting to get the rewards. That doesn't fix anything when it comes to botting.
---
Plan on having various ships for different kinds of fleets; frigates, covops; main line, etc. your FCs will tell you what to bring and they‚Äôll most likely have some ships and ammo pre-stocked if they‚Äôre competent.
---
Also plan on both regular and surprise fleets. I always keep one character back home to crab between op days so I can keep the revenue flowing. 
---
I know it can be hard to accept but not every post needs to be directed to talking about yourself.
---
Basically we have to rely on mass afk cloaking for that privilege. And even then we lose the dreads at a crazy level but at least guarantee a kill in most cases.
---
Sounds like a great fight, thanks for sharing!
---
The only problem I have with current wardec mechanics is people who talk smack but don't have a structure, can do so without repercussions.
---
Also I think the fact that a militia corp can awox and not be deced is another issue, either make awoxing militia impossible or revert the wardecs
---
The term "carebear" can mean anything from someone who likes to mine to someone who only pvps when his fleets numbers are greater. Most people here think their play style is the best. Frankly, I run level 4 missions in a Cerb. No Gila. No Rattlesnake. No VNI. I go against the grain. I pvp because its fun not because I know I'll win. If I could give one piece of advice to anyone in this game... stay solo as long as possible. Then find a small active corp. Avoid the large muff like Goons or Test. They're the ones who ruin this game because of how they play and their ego attitude. 
---
play path of exile instead

Imagine being this dumb

6 months ago you could probably make 400m a month off of a toon but right now there is no way. As of this post if you were to do pricing off of Jita buy you would get the following:
---
Injector: 895m
---
Extrator: 427m
---
MTC: 1,844m
---
You create 3.888 injectors a month exactly so at 895m you make 3,480m income and at 427m an extrator it costs you 1,660m throw on the MTC it will cost you an additional 1,844m a month after some quick maths you are turning out about 24.5m a month per account profit. 
---
This also assumes you are selling directly so you are not paying any taxs, you could potentially make more if you did buy orders on those numbers at the top but I doubt you would consistently crack 100m profit per account.
---
As soon as i realized the above i switched all my accounts over to PI training and when the MTC's lapse on the 17th I am not planning on renewing. If I were you I would consider selling the characters on the Bazaar and maybe make 5b each

If you warp and turn on autopilot in warp (a common tactic for autodocking) the ship will instantly start moving when landing in a bubble.

It really was a blast!

Great video. Any tips for a casual player on finding at least semi fair fights on a consistent bases?

Is that a challenge?
---
Oh hell yes. 
---
You've gotta remember that EVE was designed by a single guy during a 72 acid trip. Well, that's what I like to imagine.
---
A question for the lowsec boys out there, does this sim account for the chance that your kikimora pilot shoots an ally and takes gate guns? No, I'm not speaking from experience.
---
And one for my wormhollers, can this sim take into account wormhole jump mechanics like polarizing the enemy tackle and killing it alone?
---
I'm going to go with a no. Making diplos deal with stupid bullshit rarely puts them in a charitable mood. Regardless of whether you're right or not.
---
Haha no

The anticipation is killing me
---
What scheme? All you're doing is extracting sp ea month to help offset the cost of PLEXing the accounts. Who gives a shit? Also, how is the economy going to shit? Ever heard of Delve? Also, not really a reason. The economy is fine. The only major things that have gone up are anything to do with skill points and then PLEX itself. SP farming didn't cause PLEX to keep going up. It's ALWAYS gone up.
---
A second account is useful waayyy earlier then having a carrier.
---
Join them and see! Make sure you pick the right side though.
---
Are you trying to insult me? 
---
I think it's worth playing if you're with the right group. I use to strive to make enough isk to PLEX. Not worth it. Turns into a job and the game sucks. Pay the sub, make some isk to whelp ships in PvP or go do some exploration or something. Get in on some fleets. Join some NPSI (Not Purple Shoot it) groups like bombers bar (when they don't have internal issues). Go try to blow shit up, it's the most fun in the game honestly. CODE shenanigans are kind of  boring and not nearly as fun as roaming null in delve or something trying to take out a VNI or excavators or go with a small gang to drop on some other small gang.

Are you sure that wasn't Uriel trying to get more information out of DZ?

Dantelion seems to be saying a whole lot of nothing said using many 'I'm being very reasonable' comments. If Gatts is the same person, they belie the professed reasonable position by saying they will work against any(every)thing they think 'wardeccers' want.

Also, if you think the continuum from PL to E-UNI to PIRAT is 'marginally different' I don't think you know enough about the game to have an informed position to propose any change from...

Hey, dude. I know Olmeca is a bit special, but way to launch into multi-paragraph, self-important tirade while ignoring the main point of his post. The sticky only makes it more incredible, holy fuck.
---
Let's forget about the post or Olmeca for a moment. I know just thinking about him makes you very upset, so let's do a little breathing exercise. Close your eyes and imagine there is a feather floating in front of you. Now try to keep it floating in one place by breathing in and out: In...Out...In...Out...That's it...Slower Now...In...Out...In Out...
---
Feeling better? Good. Now answer this question for me. 
---
When you see a post by somebody you dislike, or a post that upsets you, purely for personal reasons, without breaking any rules, have you ever trawled through that person's previous posting history, for any infractions, big or small, that would allow you to temp or perma ban them? How likely are you to do that to somebody you dislike vs just a random a poster? What about fishing through a person's other online accounts, in search of something embarrassing to share with your buds? When you haven't found anything, have you ever purposely provoked somebody to break the rules?
---
You know, as much as it might upset autistic people who are a bit more self-aware, like me, you and the rest of the Goon inner-circle, there is nothing in the subreddit's rules preventing Olmeca from publicly posting his meltdowns. Grow the fuck up. Don't like somebody, stop stalking their posts and jerking yourself off with your mates over your mod status like a fucking creep.
---
Also, /u/Olmeca_Gold. I've been in Elysium long enough to know that Goons don't hesitate from doxxing people and going through their personal online stuff to find a reason to kick them out, for all sort of benign reasons. So that part about doxxing really made me laugh. Jibrish was probably just joking about being able to get away with the same thing here. 
---
Man, I feel so bad that you took his joke the wrong way, I better get him some Reddit Gold.
---
Sometimes you get the shakes even when you do everything right! Good story.
---
Only reason some1 starts his post with "I'm a vet" is because they expect that will somehow give them favourable treatment.
---
So fuck them.
---
Yes, we need more meaningless numbers, ones that interact with noone, add nothing to the game. Are they there or not, noone would spot the difference.
---
Only if you felt insulted. 
---
Simply sharing an opinion. 
---
What does it do?
---
Well I think you are talking about 'scripting or hacking' rather than botting at that point.  
---
One of the primary distinctions is that a bot is player-less, and by nature is usually less-capable than an above average player.
---
Either way, WoW failed because it held to pvp rewards and tried to fight the arms race.

If you jump into lowesec from highsec instead of a cruiser gatecamp you will find 5 supers and 1 Long point dual web tackle

Yes .. fuck yes .. now you have skin in the game .. so Q2 is the stability release.. then what .. like what‚Äôs this building towards .. stability of existing features with content refresh? or is their more to the story .. so cool you‚Äôve bought some  community equity up until Q2 .. with this announcement.. tick .. op success..
---
But why .. why stabilize existing features .. there‚Äôs more to this beyond ‚Äúnow your fights are quicker and graphics look amazing..‚Äù what‚Äôs next 
---
Come Q2 that‚Äôs the only question now that matters .. what‚Äôs Q3 and Q4 ... look like 
---
We can.. but should we? 
---
Ok, got it, thanks
---
generally yes.
---
good if your wanting pvp.
---
but if you don't, it can quickly turn bad.

it was default back in a day. but CCP dev removed it once,

the problem is not the eve client.
---
its the 20 year old single core 32 bit server core.
---
half done brain in the box stuff that never got finished and all decent devs are long gone.
---
i am really worried about eves future because all that client stuff can hide the core issues the game has since launch for so long.
---
and with so many devs gone that did know the code well who can do real work?
---
like fixing the beast that is the overview with bugs that exist since 10+ years.
---
&gt; I generally play PVE, just chilling and running missions to make money to collect more ships. Last I heard, the game was pretty much unplayable for folks like me (carebears who hang out in high sec systems and don't PVP) due to suicide gankers. Anything changed? Or is that what I have to look forward to, once again? 
---
Use some common sense and don't mission in highly popular systems or in/near pipelines. Go out of your way a bit and find a quiet corner. The LP income will not be as good but you'll have relative peace and quiet.
---
Do not join a corp with structures. You will be wardecced and therefore targetted. Do not build any structures if you are in your own solo corp for the same reason.
---
Establish yourself in 2-4 such systems, 1 for each factions or at least 2 of opposite ones so you can rotate your missions if you start incurring too much standing loss and don't have to worry about bringing all your ships, just jumpclone or hop into a fast frigate and zoom right over. Keep an empty (no implants) clone at a player owned citadel to avoid jump timer, or keep one in a station of your choice.
---
Try out Abyss and Triglavian ships. Trig ships are currently the most fun to play in the whole game, doing L4 missions is a hell of a lot better in Drekavac or Vedmak then in anything else, it is not most ISK efficient due to ammo expense, but its very much worth it. When you first start Abyss, make farmign T3s your initial goal, once you get T3s down, scale up to T4s, once you get T4s down go do some 5s. T5 Abyss is challenging and requires investment and you can very easily lose that entire investment, but its a nice payout.
---
In the last 3 years, outside of actual fights I have lost only 1 ship in HS due to gank, and almost lost another and accidentally got myself concorded once. Thats it. 
---
Wait maybe it was you....the handsome English professor looking fella with glasses?
---
Fair point. Now that I think of it, a few years back I used to work on a distribution floor that was entirely run by a Windows 98 PC, because upgrading that would mean having to upgrade everything else. We weren't allowed to touch it because the IT guy was reasonably concerned it might collapse into a pile of dust if you so much as looked at it too harshly.
---
I bwlieve their is....a story so type thing on the forums

I don‚Äôt even understand that sentence.

You have 4 dudes follow you around and do what you do. Sure \*you\* need to actually input stuff, but the 4 other dudes don't. Semantics aside, all of those things ruin games.

I typically just buy them from the market. Look for 'filament' and there are 5 difficulties and 5 types.

Start with 'calm' to learn the structure and how they work, but work your way up based on how strong of a ship you have and how much you want to risk. :)

It‚Äôs actually a bit different. There will be casual references to things in EVE, but I don‚Äôt want it to be a ‚Äòhey, remember this event?‚Äô kind of thing. It‚Äôs going to be a story that plays in New Eden, that has a few surprises, and that will be its own entity.
---
Lore -can- be useful insofar as it explains a few things, but it‚Äôs not about explaining EVE.
---
Templar One and Empyrean Age explained some concepts ‚Äòa Raven-class Battleship‚Äô, but I‚Äôm not doing that. I‚Äôm writing it from the perspective of people who know what these things are. Some of the things will not be easy on outsiders, they are very much going to be something for the cognoscenti.
---
At the same time it will be understood [it is hoped] as a story in its own right, something that has its own internal narrative. I don‚Äôt need to explain every last detail with regards to what happens in New Eden [bleh]. Most concepts will only be referenced in passing.
---
At the same time I‚Äôm not bound by a limit in words, I can elaborate quite extensively on some aspects that are important in the story.
---
I‚Äôm going to stop explaining things. I‚Äôm busy writing the thing.

Had a similar fight where a mate docked with 6% structure left. A stiff breeze would have done him in at that point. Unfortunately no screenshot(s) because it was just "fuck off repair and get back out here!" as it was just him and I versus 5-6 enemies on grid. 
---
same - also kill reels are cool
---
you don't have to pay for both of them, you just have to click the launch buttons for both in rapid succession then do the same in the character selection screen and u'll multibox for free. it's against the tos but so are a whole lot of other things that go unpunished no problem. normally i'd say do it at ur own risk but there's really no risk, the system that's supposed to prevent this is automated and fails if u just click quickly enough lol

64-bit desktop operating systems have been around for about 17 years. Consumer hardware that supports only 32-bit hasn't been a thing for even longer.
---
Ray tracing like most graphics features, can be turned off client side and only turned on for hardware that supports it. Same with DX11 and DX12. DX11 compatibility can be maintained and is in most modern games. DX11 compatible graphics cards have been mainstream for nearly a decade now, and DX12 for almost 7 years.
---
Why should we hold back the entire game because of a tiny tiny minority of people who are using ancient hardware with ancient operating systems?
---
Ahhhh yes. The assets of a lazy boi...at least he probably didn't spend his first 2 years leaving 1 item in every station he went to because he didn't know that you could autolink things.

So all Corp B has to do is call a guy from Corp D, and the second he engaged, Corp C's support guys get blapped off the field? Opens up more avenues for exploits without closing any.

Fit your punisher with autocannons since it doesn't get a damage bonus to lasers and autocannons don't take cap. Also a buffer fit would be good so you don't have to run an active tank. The punisher can field a nasty armor buffer tank with good skills. Other than that you need to move in on top of them in a plex as they are landing so you get your scram and web on them, which generally requires you to be sitting in the plex first.

Idk about that fam, most business use Windows because it's much more cost effective for general work not requiring one of 3 MacOS specific pieces of software.

Most serious content creators are also using Windows because they need to leverage actual professional grade hardware to complete work in a timely manner.

Driver support only goes so far, the main enabling feature is that the tracing of rays happens on dedicated physical hardware separate from the rest of the rendering pipeline specifically optimized to the task. Even then it bottlenecks the traditional pipeline hard.
---
Depends on how many light sources they try to incorporate.
---
e.g. weapons flashes lighting up your hull with Ray tracing would be /splooge but would probably scale poorly. Then again that seems easy enough to set as a High/Low preference and/or set a hard cap on the number of light sources.
---
EveMon works fine for viewing assets, skills and stuff. It is not web based though.

They absolutely will, but not in time for the next generation. Those architecture decisions were set in stone a long time ago and take years to reach fruition.

Now try to keep it floating in one place by breathing in and out: In...Out...In...Out...That's it...Slower Now...In...Out...In Out...
---
Imagine waking up and being this guy that posts shit like this thinking it makes you look good. 
---
more like high effort low reward 1592
---
best way to deal with it. cap booster
---
What about timezone tanking the War HQ?
---
+1
---
War HQ should get wormhole structure reinforcement timers.
---
Events usually happen around 20:00 21:00 so for us tz you can mis out on a lot. There are purple fleets most days (red and blue combined). But for alpha looking for occasionally non committal content its worth it
---
It was fun when they changed i believe billboards in some way and incursions became a slaughter house. God this game is amazing.
---
Sadly the same here.  
---
I had my pod blown up by a Wingspan delivery agent just the other day.  When I saw that I had received a delivery, I did not even know I need, I was very excited.   As an ex employee of the company,  I even sent him a letter acknowledging delivery, but never got a formal document. 
---
I expected a higher level of customer service.   
---
I wonder if their has been a change in ownership since u/Wingspantt was my CEO.  
---
I usually go through every couple of months and trash things that are below like 100m.
---
Everything else (in low or high sec) I just throw on public contract at 80% jita and it'll get picked up in a few hours.
---
There are guys out there that make mad isk buying public contracts in lowsec and jfing them everywhere, especially in asset safety hotspots.
---
This one time me and my friend discovered an astra that had a load of hanger containers floating around it. Long story short he stole a faction/deadspace fit pancake and I 1v1ed a vindi into hull with my stratios orbiting at 500. 
---
Eventually a nutegeddon lands on us and I have to choose between keeping my scram or reps running through cap injections. The vindi warps off in 20% hull and the geddon has no point so I also manage to gtfo...I was at 2% hull.
---
Contract to free alt, biomass alt ocassionally (if desired).
---
There's also services which will just take whatever random garbage you want to throw at them.
---
meh :effort:.
---
I just need another 49" monitor so I can drag that asset list down some more and not need to scroll.
---
I have kept telling  jib he needed too
---
It‚Äôs just a matter of getting used to an order of things. Check this character briefly for x, then move attention to your other account to make sure all is good. It‚Äôs actually quite fun.
---
I recommend you get something like Eve-O Previewer to enhance this experience. You can google search and find an updated version. 
---
I'm curious what the average cost was.
---
i doubt anyone is going to by my ibis collection tbh.
---
Thanks for this response, Falcon.
---
Weird, it's always on as default for me, and I have to always toggle it off.
---
No
---
I have no opinion on the duration of the timer and such, but I personally feel that all structures should have asset safety removed, just as it is in Wormholes.
---
I hear the argument about people losing their stuff isn‚Äôt good, but aren‚Äôt NPC stations good for storing all of King Midas‚Äô gold? Imo Upwell structures should hold strategic value and just because you want to keep a cache of dreads on hand in some strategic location doesn‚Äôt mean that you shouldn‚Äôt have to account for their destruction or being scooped up by whomever decides to kick that castle over.
---
Upwell structures were a mistake, but this is a good remedy to clear lots out and it be worth the time and effort!
---
I like the video. I don't know what it has to do with me, but keep it up :). 
---
I stole lots of drones in your B-7 pocket, but where I also faced strong resistance and reactions last year. o7
---
PS: I am confused why I can still post lol. Pretty sure I received a ban message from the subreddit.
---
NPCs that come and clean up the dark ochre, but are easily blapped if they touch our crok?
---
yes please!
---
I was worried for a second. I am the 1%!
---
I wonder how they come up with precisely those constants.
---
Miss you
---
&gt;Last I heard, the game was pretty much unplayable for folks like me (carebears who hang out in high sec systems and don't PVP) due to suicide gankers. 
---
That's basically never been true,  if you are in  a big hub maybe you want to keep the fittings pretty cheap but a few faction damage mods and a nice booster/rep is probably fine. In some backwater system you can probably fit just about anything seems like years since I've seen anything that even looks like a ganker. 
---
That said there's always the chance some group gets bored and does a random gank but those are pretty rare.  Can look for ganks pretty easily on zkill, just about never see mission ships unless stupidly blinged and usually flying through a trade pipeline https://zkillboard.com/kills/ganked/
---
For mission runners pretty much the last new content was ~4.5 years ago with burners. and before that like 8 years ago or something, pretty sure that's the last time they added a new missions, honestly might have been 10 years ago now. 
---
We shouldn't... But we probably will anyway
---
I'm just curious why they felt the need to take the log of and exponentiate of the same number and multiply it together
---
Magic? Got ya. Unless you want CCP to hire a guy to physically watch over every player‚Äôs shoulder any time they launch an alpha account to make sure they‚Äôre not cheating.
---
This is such a fucking dumb comment. There is a gigantic list of companies that stopped supporting a 32bit binary after they released a 64-bit platform or a ton of games that ONLY run on 64-bit from the get-go. It makes no sense whatsoever to maintain two different architecture types, especially when one hasn't been industry standard for ~10 years and you have almost no playerbase on it. I'd even venture that a big chunk of people still using 32bit clients is people botting on shitty VM's that don't run a 64 bit OS, assuming that the botting software can run on a 32 bit machine. (a lot of Russian/Chinese VM's still offer 32 bit OS for VM's, but I'm not sure about the requirements for whatever botting software is out there).
---
Huh
---
Look, EVE is a place where we all fight and steal eachothers toys. I find Reddit the bar where we all go to have a drink. Thanks for stopping by. I was planning this video for a bit and it coincided with your recent post, to where you talk about propaganda with Goons on Reddit. That is the only connection. See ya around. 
---
maybe see here is the math plotted can help?....[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lQlt8iiXK789L0ZnPb0pXE0gVgwD7ha2CCqyfGnB-58/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lQlt8iiXK789L0ZnPb0pXE0gVgwD7ha2CCqyfGnB-58/edit#gid=0)
---
Right on bud!
---
Jaguars can be pretty nasty in PVP situations, a great choice of ship. :)
---
All this changes are client side, big battles will work as they are now since that's a server-side problem only.
---
Lol, r/eve meta is that eve be dead before Ray tracing mainstream. 
---
If you like PvE and new ships, Triglavian ships are new. Check them out.
---
do you really think that the chinese have no influence over people in korea?
---
This fact is what bothers me the most. They could just go for vulkan and have a similar performance and features on all platforms. Instead, us linux gamers, will have to rely on crapy conversions that won't work as well and might even face being left outside the game altogether. 
---
I really find this infuriating
---
Don't buy the pack, it has bad content in it that's not worth it. Save your real life money until you have more in game understanding of how to use it.
---
Eve is great. As long as you have a goal, there endless possibilities in the game. 
---
Can be a market shark, solo pvp, small gang pvp, fleet pvp, mission running, piracy, list goes on. 
---
I bet MS and/or Nvidia had something to with it.
---
PIRAT,
---
Not even worth the read. Did you know all the shady shit account sharing and RMT that goes on in PIRAT?
---
Corp C's guys get blapped off the field - *if* safeties have been set to red, otherwise your reps just shut off and stop cycling (as they would in a current situation where reps would get you Concordokken'ed with green/yellow safety).
---
And at that point, you've voluntarily taken that risk on yourself and I don't particularly feel sympathy for anyone getting CONCORD'ed in highsec because they shut off safeties.
---
The tears running down your face.
---
Autocannons! 
---
Not worth the read. Who would you rather have insight from? Someone that has a deep knowledge and experience of the mechanics and meta, or some guy that posts half-hatched ideas?
---
I understand the hate - I get it.
---
I understand downvoting - I get it.
---
I understand that it‚Äôs a facet of gameplay you probably find undesirable - I get it.
---
The truth is that I have no idea of the ‚Äúshady shit‚Äù existing in Pirat that you talk about. 
---
- No one is account sharing. 
---
- I don‚Äôt see where the original CEO allegedly botting has any positive effect on Pirat because the whole operation is self-sustaining through contracts and loot drops. He isn‚Äôt involved and if he was / is RMT‚Äôing then that‚Äôs between him and CCP.
---
I like being a centra point of hate and sperging in highsec, but I will be frank. I and others involved have a better idea of the nuances and issues with highsec than some ransoms posting here or on the Eve-O forums. I think if you took the time to remove your hate spectacles and have actual discussions with some of us, then you‚Äôd find that some of our core beliefs aren‚Äôt that outlandish and maybe we‚Äôre not all evil monsters :)
---
Yea totally bots.
---
I love this.
---
Not even just linux gamers, Dx12 is windows 10 only.
---
you must be new here.
---
Isn't this this civ VI (V?) soundtrack?
---
Cool, in which case all your war target has to do is get a random one-man corp set up, have them wardec one of you but not the other, and gave him show up to effectively neutralise half the fleet. 
---
Again, it's opening loopholes to be exploited in order to cater for something _that is not necessary_. As said, form two fleets and just coordinate them to fly together but separate, or form an alliance using the tools in the game. Making things more exploitable for everyone else to cater to two groups who don't want to use the tools available is never going to be a good idea.
---
I'm at year 4 and it's still a pretty good game :D
---
Scram and 10mn afterburner in mids is key to punisher solo pvp, it has large enough power grid for the 10mn which will make you faster than any other ship which is not also using a 10mn (as long as you can get within scram range of any mwd ships).
---
You have to pulse the ab to adjust your direction after each cycle though as the 10mn ab will reduce your ability to turn while active. 
---
As far as guns go, i would run whatever feels right and works with your scram range. Good luck!
---
dont end up in this trap, sp farming sounds really nice on paper, but the reality of it is doing a bunch of repetitive routine things that feel more like a job than a game just for a small profit. actually what I just said right there pretty much describes almost every in game way to earn isk that there is.  they want you to buy plex. they really really want you to. you can try to worm your way around it and invest yourself into however many various scheme to earn isk in game, but at the end of the day its all pain. actually just uninstall this game immediately and run while you still can
---
How long has this been a thing, fml that's so useful
---
More like a thousand. 
---
I would personally stick with lasers to feel like im making the most of the ships bonuses, since you'll be out of neut range with the 10mn you won't have to worry about them using cap.
---
That's it. Who put a quarter in the Wally bot.

hes actually in alot of trouble, thats gevlons newest fit, was not supposed to be here, thats for the lowsec ops, this was in side 0.0
---
Wat? 
---
The important thing is a CONDOR COUNTRY condor got the final blow on the Fort.
---
I like bouncing from highsec to low. When I get bored with missions, well let go explo/belt-rat/run sites while avoiding getting ganked. 
---
My god and I thought I destroyed english.... 
---
ttttttttttttttttttttttttttt

WGEN I PRESS SHIFT T I HEAR BEEP

its a concept called lowsec. gotta be lowsec to understand lowsec.

They say in the blog it's around 100mill
---
my wife told me to shut up, i was giggling too hard, ty all for pretending to take this seriously like a bunch of fucking retards, lmao. really made my night, wow relaly cool kanye, hahahhaa
---
Jesus christ when will someone finally step up to the snuff menace and end this shit?
---
Was good fight. Thanks for bringing it everyone. Sad horde left so early :(
---
Ok, that aar is confusing... Thomas Lear the FC of the Liberty  Squad (Imperium squad) fleet got word that a timer/fight was going down in Kamela so we linked up with BL(we already engaged PH earlier in the night and decided to join the fight. Liberty Squad jumped off of Elo's titan to a system a couple jumps put of Kamela. We enter system and a couple warps later we are on the fortizar grid. We try and engage horde fleet, they warp off. We then warp to them at 0 and a brawl starts with BL attacking horde as well, that fight seemed evenish and then horde warps to the fort grid. We follow and eventually engage horde again and that seemed to me that we killed more horde than us, they warp off grid for good.
---
We then engage the rattlesnake fleet and kill a bunch of them. They eventually warped off and then we tried to engage the abaddons but they warped most of that fleet before we could get a lot of damage to that fleet. We then engaged the fort to kill it off. We noticed an Aeon on grid, we bump it off tether and a couple people go to reship into hics, some do and get on grid. Thomas calls in NSH with a dread bomb to kill the Aeon, apostle and a nizanu and we finish the fort kill.
---
I think the funniest part about tonight was when we headed home and saw a BL muinin got tackled when we jumped into the next gate and we save it from a harpy fleet.
---
Was fun, 10/10 would do again.
---
I have maybe a few months of actual play time. Thanks for the positive words 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfrwxcm6kp0

Olmeca would type a minimum 500 words thread how he has done it, how he prepared everything and how it was all the fault of Goons.
---
Since Chance is not the Youtube Posterboy anymore Wingspan is dead anyways.... but still more alive then PL and HK tbh.....
---
Now you've triggered Olmecas Dunning Kruger :/ He will create a thread with not less then 1000 Words how much impact he got, and that he is very relevant!
---
P.S. I got promised Bovril would kill Goons, WHEN ?
---
Ok that make sense and I am on my third ship tonight... the pled I was just I had battlecrusier rats that just took forever for me to kill think I need to add a heat sink. I stoped scanning for like 1 sec and got jumped dead then poded in warp back to the gate ( not even sure what happened 
---
You need to stop feeding let alone feeding retards like aangspun

Citadel unanchored. Not a fight home slice
---
I feel so sad that we are the only real existing content for everyone in New Eden :( 
---
Thanks for the advise maybe ship 4 I will acually get to fight someone rather then being stuck and helpless. 
---
We fight SG/SC constantly. We've blued them on multi occasions to shoot a bigger dude.
---
This is our lowsec to shit up.
---
Abyssal sites are pretty awesome if you're a mission runner. Way better income too.
---
Somebody else mentioned missioning in a marshal. Don't do that. Just use a marauder like normal hisec carebears *and don't afk ever*. 
---
I'm one of the hisec mission runners who sometimes get ganked, but usually it's because I fall asleep with my ship on a gate. Inside a mission pocket you're pretty much fine, especially if you're flying something with a half decent tank.
---
Also like you I'm a +100m sp player who enjoys just hanging out in hisec most of the time so if you want to pm me I can give further advice or information.
---
Jep Marshy and Olmeca doing a great job and fighting 3rd Party Users with 3rd Party Tools. As we dont have to proove anything these days its a fact Marshy and Olmeca are bots !

The 3 biggest titan engagement this game had since b-r were plagued with this issue, i don't know the numbers, but I will assume based on the experience i heard from others that every single time there was a titan volley, at least a few hundred people would crash due to their client hiting the 4gb limit. 
---
And due to that, I think its safe to say that a big reason why the 3 biggest titan fights this game had since b-r had very little impact outside of the eve playerbase, is mostly because the vast majority of people who were recording with settings that actually allowed you to see  the Doomsdays would crash every few minutes due to their client reaching the 4gb limit, thus making it pretty much impossible to compile any decent footage of the fight.
---
Not even mentioning streaming, I feel sorry for the people who saw "oh hey eve is having a big titan brawl" to go to watch one of the streams that weren't in potato mode and all they got to watch was the login screen, and the ocasional slideshow of what could look like a beautiful game.
---
This game main attractive quality to people who don't know anything about eve have always been its big fights, yet if the game can't even handle those fights, how can ccp hope to attract enugh eye balls to keep the player base numbers healthy?
---
Therefore I think their urgency to update eve to x64 and even their goal of introducing cutting edge graphics technology like Ray Tracing to be an understandable one, they know what gets people talking about this game, the fights, and the amazing videos that players make about those fights.

I could literally see the stroke settling in over the course of your post. You started mostly coherent, but by the end, all blood flow had been cut off and your brain was using up its last seconds of oxygen. You must have summoned the last of your strength to press the submit button as everything went black.
---
o7 capsuleer, the cyno is now lit.
---
Oh I am smiling, I almost feel bad for some of them, and I am being honest here.
---
Ultimately, the WarHQ is what matters, despite what they say they have advocated against it and I know how much the idea ass-pains them, "hahah we wanted it all along...", yea sure..
---
But yeah, doesn't take a genius to see that those kind of behaviors come from something lacking IRL.
---
Reported.

CCPRound()
---
I played around with it slightly, and even in this environment there can be massive differences in outcomes based on target priority.  
---
In alliance matches, there was the 100 KM boundary, so it is unrealistic for some fleet designs to kite indefinitely.  
---
You also have differences in:  
---
\- Multiple target priority  
---
\- Target Switches  
---
\- Pilot Skill  
---
\- EWAR  
---
Though, it looks pretty cool to fiddle around with.
---
Used to only be on with no option to be off many years ago. Long before we had the "inventory" window.
---
Maybe try a medium Corp that is in your time zone. That way you don't make or break their plans. In a larger group there are people who work in specialist groups for recon, hunting, logistics etc so you can be more than an f1 hitter. But up to you.
---
Shut up wally
---
r/eveporn ?
---
Exactly ! You need to set yourself a goal
---
No that's just that one guy that played Tetris way too much and can fit more in a space than is physically possible.
---
We are done talking, I had that discussion with your group enough times and I'm done with it.
---
All I can say is you guys show your short-sightedness again, this is only a first step, I will personally advocate for a stratification of corps and structures in High-Sec so that you will be affected.
---
I eagerly anticipate your arguments then. Although I bet they will be like that post of yours, lacking.
---
Load up an industrial while its your current ship, switch to a different ship, see that one being totally overloaded because bonuses are calculated when you are in it and not in hangar bay.
---
Was fully expecting to ISBoxer
---
This guy is spot on. My Meme punisher is auto cannon with two 400mm plates, an enam, and a gyrostab. 100% passive with around 15k ehp. You can also push it to 20k+ with a slave set and be a real douche. 
---
BL wasn't defending shit. We made sure that forti stayed paused, started by killing horde muninns, then killed Hullpen apocs, then killed DHSJ rattlesnakes, then helped kill fortizar. DHSJ decided to dread bomb on the aeon who thought it a good idea to chill on the edge of tether, then launch fighters to untether. BL shot that too.
---
Oh no!!1!
---
[I am the man who arranges the blocks.](https://youtu.be/hWTFG3J1CP8)
---
You‚Äôve yet to have a discussion with me though. I‚Äôm capable of having one without calling you a retard or a carebear.
---
You do realize that I‚Äôm in Pirat, right? The structure change benefits us the MOST. The changes in the dev blog do nothing to empower smaller groups or solo wardeccers or balance anything on that lower end. What this does is further solidified that it‚Äôs beneficial to be in a larger group - a group that will blanket dec, camp hubs and pipes, and persist to be the bane of Highsec.
---
So since we know you hate wars, please will you have a discussion with me? You know how I feel based on my previous response, but will you tell me how Highsec being a cosmic paradise fits into the theme of a sandbox mmo? 
---
They forgot a zero or two.
---
48 hours already 
---
omg.... 
---
I just wanted to do you all a favour... buy shares in kleenex and hold my beer.
---
Lol, when a nyx is dropped on by a bunch of formerly blue supers/titans, and responds by warping to his next site and starting up again.....pretty sure it's a bad bot.
---
There are a new class of mods you might run into, Abyssal mods. They're mods created from a new type of item (a mutaplasmid) that randomizes the characteristics of the mod they're used on within certain percentage values of where the mods start from.
---
I mention this because one of the mods that can be modified are shield boosters, and high-end Guristas shield boosters -- since they start from very good percentage values -- are both good targets for these mutaplasmids and since they're relatively cheap, using one doesn't make you much more of a gank target.
---
Something you might want to look into adding to your mission ship, particularly since the Machariel has been rebalanced since you left to use +1 Mid, -1 Low.
---
The mutaplasmids themselves come from "Abyssal deadspace", a new type of PvE area that you also might be interested in looking into.
---
You can learn more about it here: https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Abyssal_Deadspace

Wally, It was us and Panic. BL was not part of us in this fight.
---
Super was a yolo for shits and giggles.
---
True AAR and not Wallys bad memes. (short and sweet version)
---
\-Hullpen decides to go have one last fight on our fort. We knew it was going to die eventually but why not go down and atleast have a fight out of it and bring a few toys.
---
\-DHSJ Forms Rattlesnakes and basi's.
---
\-Hull Pen/ Panic is in Navpocs with Fax support.
---
\-Hull Pen drops fax and a few haw dreads
---
\-DHSJ Drops 2 Minos.
---
\-No clue where PH/BL/Goons came from but hey the more the merrier.
---
\-Isn't doing much but hey, insurance free insurance money on caps collecting dust.
---
\-One guy not in fleet/comms wants to yolo his Aeon and watch it go out in a ball of fire, props for him to having the balls to just throw it out there.
---
\-Hull Pen fort dies after almost a year of getting hit by DHSJ finally. 
---
GF's 
---
It was actually a pretty interesting fight. We didn't show up to kill the structure it kinda just happened when we were the only ones left on grid.
---
It looks your assets and ships window into your right hand station panel. It's neat if you own less then 3 ships, garbage otherwise.
---
i guess botting is fine if hes blue 
---
if only, so we wouldn't have to read his posts in the past
---
To be honest rvb is nowhere near what it used to be for fast pvp content. It has dropped activity a lot past years following more generally the trend of HS and LS space. Nevertheless all you really need is a couple of people active at your usual hours so it might match well enough. In any case nobody is going to reject you later because you‚Äôve been in RvB so why not just try it and see by yourself.
---
;)
---
You will notice near main hubs a SHITLOAD of new structures owned by corps/alliances (though not in the main trade hub systems, they are too crowded most of the time anyways). These you can dock up if they let you, use their services etc. They are pretty much like the normal NPC stations but are specialized (for combat, for industry etc).
---
If you end up eventually getting to Delve region of Null Sec either roaming, a wormhole or joining Imperium, you will see literally thousands of them in the region. Even as a Goon and Imperium member I think it's disgusting how populated teh regions gotten.
---
1) Highsec pvp
---
2) Neutral Alt
---
3) Fighting on Station and docking.

Snore.

i'm coming back after 6.5 years, i've been wardecced in the years i've been gone for some reason.
---
what changes are there to wardecs?
---
I would say none should have a cap.
---
Did OP suffer a stroke midway through?
---
I suggested a CONCORD office in a defined structure which controlled all the war decs above five wardecs and if the structure was destroyed only five war decs were left live.   The CONCORD agent would supply location and online status as per locator agents by asking in person and had limitations.    They completely refused to accept this idea at all, one of them because it made them too vulnerable to nullsec blocks.    
---
Another eye opener was the locator agents when I suggested that if I had good standings with the locator agent they used he would give me the heads up that I was being asked about.   It was like we have to have all the tools to benefit them.
---
Also when I joined the war dec discord I made it clear that I had not war decked much, but had observed them a hell of a lot and had been war decked a few times including a successful counter play on a couple of wars.   I was there to give them a view of the other side.   And all I would get was being told I was not a war decker which was odd because I was quite clear about that.
---
Sol is not a war decker, he is a ganker and when he joined which was part of the way through my time there he really made it all about his own issues.    Dom for a brief period when I was there was actually OK, but when Sol turned up he seemed to go like Sol.
---
Faylee Faye was very open, he was combative which was fine, but he would listen and think it through.
---
My objective during my period there was to try to see how we can get the defender to start getting involved in the content to have fun with it, but they hated that.   And you see that in a number of your discussions, most notably Sol who has decided that for the carebears in hisec the game should never be fun.
---
I came away from the place that apart from Toxic Yaken, Faylee Faye, the guy who was running FEDUP and Commande Aze the people there were living on past glory and were unable to change at all.   I realized that it was a totally zero sum game trying to make them think, especially as I was spending more time fending off more and more hysterical and personal attacks by Sol and Dom aided in part by Noregen.   It became not worth my time so I walked.    I told them that CCP would do the HQ system in some way and so it has been proved, I told them to push for that rather than end up with some silly capture the flag type game which was not Eve.    Thankfully Bric seems to have done a very good job on this.
---
I can confirm that Faylee did agree with the war dec HQ in some sort of form, he was receptive to what I suggested and was interested in what could happen.
---
Imagine deleting hostile structures one dd volley At a time.
---
Super capital deployments would be much shorter
---
I was expecting holoreels w/ exotic dancers in animal costumes   
---
 
---
&gt;if you think im spouting mad nonsense, welcome to eve lore 
---
Sadly Faylee was extracted and biomassed in an attempt to quit around November. I lasted until a few weeks ago. :)
---
Having fun though, so that‚Äôs important. I will be on Open Comms tonight on Twitch, you should check it out!
---
I mean you'd still have three timers, they just wouldn't take 45 minutes to deal with a structure worth 500mil.

Damn, sorry to hear that.   And you did well I lasted three weeks on my last break, lol.
---
I am having fun at the moment, pity that the war dec thing I tried to go with went in a different direction to what I wanted but it happens.
---
Depends what time it is, you have great ideas so would be good to listen in, but wife might be accommodating to that.
---
No reason apart being able to choose when to inject themselves into the fight and avoid being primary. 
---
The only reason not to use them currently is that you don't have them. 
---
They partially addressed it, but they didn't go far enough
---
rip wally
---
Yeah it was a fun fight! :)
---
I didn‚Äôt realize Cannibal Kane was back. Was a surprise to see him. I‚Äôm playing on Robocop.. I guess it‚Äôll be my new main. 
---
Think thats actually a good suggestion! :)  
---
We will look into this and try to make a good solution which could be suitable for this kind of use.
---
I do think we will add a new field in the search query where you can give in the amount of m3 you have left in your ship. The system will try to search for the best possible matches where the best profit could be made (calculated as ISK per Jump - 7.5% (average) fee).
---
Is this something you might use?
---
those arent condors, those are EAGLES 
---
can you write for the NER? i want this to be read out by someone in a serious report 
---
no this is actual content, you dont want that sharked over someone posting a zkill and not bothering to write a word about it 
---
No AAR or is this just merely an extremely lazy shitpost?
---
not worth time to explain eve players economics, they are too dumb for it. they have no idea what is faucet and sink anyway
---
Ships with remote repair start locking as soon as a friendly starts taking damage.  
---
After that they cycle the repairs, repairing at the start of the cycle for shields or the end for armor/hull.  
---
Target resistance is factored in for the repair.  
---
There's also a system in place to avoid massively over repairing and having the target die bewtween cycles.  
---
Currently each fit will position independently, selecting it's own anchor and following it around.  
---
Logi tries to take as little damage as possible while staying in repair range.  
---
Support ships try and take as little damage as possible while also applying their ewar.  
---
If required support ships will also unanchor in order to keep applying ewar to their target/s.  
---
It's particularly common to see this when support ships are trying to spread scrams across the opposing fleet.  
---
All other ships try to keep *damage done / damage taken* as high as possible.  
---
They will also keep application at 30% or higher if at all possible, so they won't shoot from deep falloff just because the ratio is higher.  
---
In terms of implementation each fit type tests to work out the best possible range every 10 simulated seconds.  
---
I can explain how exactly they do that but it gets [heavy on the math](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent's_method) very fast.  
---
Hmmm perhaps on the target switching.  
---
Outside of people setting bad target priorities, what's the use case?  
---
It's not overly hard for the AI to pick the best primaries but it would really limit user control.
---
both should be sharked
---
there is shitposting and then there's intentionally being a dumbass. this falls more in the latter (imo).
---
Ok, now i get it. :)
---
I'm fairly sure people would just run everything 2-3 times and find it annoying.
---
Thomas is hands down my favorite person in this game. NSH merging into goons 2020
---
Kane is really chill and a great guy to be around, though he does not like people who whine about their stupid choices publicly, which I can agree with, then he is all hard and aggressive which is fun to see, explosions tend to happen...
---
I have some ideas on developing stuff but it is not going to be easy, my biggest issue as I have said to others is that my time of play is not suited to running stuff as most of the major stuff happens when I am not able to play.
---
I think as we discussed before that hisec PvP and wars can develop into something fun, I know you don't like my botting comments on PIRAT and I understand you on that, but that aside I see PIRAT as something to aim at and fight, a big challenge and they really know their stuff.    However it just rubs me a little up the wrong way that they used bots to get tooled up to such a degree.   We should not fight over that, just understand each other.
---
I was hoping that we can see regional blocs develop in hisec, what do you think?
---
in example
---
Remove the cargo holds in space or put in some reinforced bulkheads with a mobile depot and this can happen. I don‚Äôt think you can warp overloaded tho
---
Take it easy
---
Steal everything you can and post it to reddit?
---
Real talk, medium (small?) structures shouldn't exist period
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
For about the same cost as a non-poverty fleet fitted leshak, you can spam another shitty little roach motel complete with tether, free repair, docking, fitting services, jump clone services, 3 damage capped reinforce sessions, the list goes on. 
---
Hell, plop a shitty little athanor on a decent moon and you can pay off the entire investment and then some after what, a week?  2 weeks?
---
How does this make any sense from an isk per utility perspective, especially when isk inflation is so out of control?  If CCP announced tomorrow that all of these shitty little structures were going to be yeeted out of new eden with the next patch, I'd be pretty stoked. Have them automatically returned to corp hangars and initiate NPC buy orders for the damned things.  I don't care. These little things are cancer. Make people pay some real isk for the benefits citadels afford, and make timers mean something again.
---
They probably kept toying with numbers until other factors were balanced out and that was the magic number that worked for them.
---
That or if they didn't use that specific number for that specific equation than it would cause an error somewhere else.
---
What do you mean by regional blocs? Coalitions that are bound to a region? Sounds kinda like Faction Warfare ;) 
---

---
Well, is that done now?
---
&gt;  jump clone services
---
those are extra, the hull of an astra is 700ish, but you need the mods too 
---
Well it's at 67% upvoted right now, so it's pretty mixed. ¬Ø\\(„ÉÑ)/¬Ø
---
Also there is a difference between garbled nonsense and suit and tie, nobody wants or expects someone to come in here with pre-formatted walls of text 5k words long to describe a fight. 
---
I mean, half the stuff in the AAR is just (knowingly) false - that alone should be enough to have it nixed.
---
Heh, great hit.
---
FC said we were going to do Faction Warfare. Instead we fought goons on a fort. Then we fought goons on the sun. We were killing em pretty hard until Elo came in and started shooting us too. We warped back to the fort, whored on a dread, declared ourselves isk positive and went home. 
---
F
---
Alliances or coalitions trying to develop their stuff in certain regions, but it needs the more peaceful type of hisec player to realise that they can in fact fight and if they put their minds to it rather well.   No forced capture the flag stuff, just based around mutual defense of their structures.    And that is my sole issue with the war dec change in that I wanted allies to be able to rep each other.   I want to create a more loose type coalition type structure.
---
I think you might have noticed in the war dec that I only saw neutral RR as stopping the skirmish type fights in hisec, but because the focus is on moving towards objective based HQ type conflict in hisec CCP just screwed over the defenders in a major way with this decision.   Arrendis gave a great example in the forum thread on the war dec changes in terms of PIE.
---
Another issue is the fact you cannot ally without a structure.
---
Both neutral RR and the ally mechanic are turned into a real nightmare of complexity by blanket war deckers.    I think that I would just go for something that hits the multiple war deckers to attack that complexity rather than hurt the defenders.
---
Understand that this is more based on trying to develop people to fight and like anything can be scaled back and adjusted.    But creating a regional bloc to defend interests is purely player play.
---
&gt; Also there is a difference between garbled nonsense and suit and tie
---
ofc there is, that is what i was getting at  
---
&gt;I mean, half the stuff in the AAR is just (knowingly) false - that alone should be enough to have it nixed.   
---
true i suppose, but it was a fun read (atleast i had a chuckle) and everyone knows that this is not a serious AAR, meaning noone will be upset about the facts being bent here, i mean its not nazguhl level of silly writing, but its still silly writing   
---
&gt;Well it's at 67% upvoted right now, so it's pretty mixed. ¬Ø\(„ÉÑ)/¬Ø   
---
i guess im part of that 67%, early votes are often a bit lower imo (i had posts that where at 30% for half a day but later ended as 80% upvoted posts) 
---
i think im just antifun today.
---
Sure, because the structures that are the weakest to the reason why there is a dmg cap, shouldn't have a dmg cap, right?  
---
That doesn't make any sense at all. If you don't like the dmg cap, I can totally understand that. But removing it from the structures that need it the most, I don't know how you got the idea that would be a good thing.  
---
This is the first time I see it working another way.
---
Calm down Dom.
---
Because people would then go back to using POS's Best reason I can think of.
---
Oh, that is funny.  FB though?  Do you have a link?
---
dont worry, its friday and you can have a nice fun (or atleast relaxing) weekend soon 
---
Also, be careful of one thing : when you land near or in the bubble of an ESS, there will be a system-wide message showing up in Local, telling everyone that you‚Äôre in range of the ESS. And if you want to steal the bounties just for yourself, you need sometimes of being in range, so everyone can just warp a combat ship and get you.
---
If you‚Äôre not bothered by losing your pod, you can try to do it in a cheap frigate and cross your fingers, or a bigger PVP ship. But since you‚Äôll probably be in an Alliance space... You could get dropped on. Another way to do it is using a nullified frigate or Tech III cruiser, since they will always warp directly on top of the ESS, and won‚Äôt have to burn out of the bubble.
---
Damn. Looks like citadel pewing is gonna cost me even more. Already costs relatively much for a lone player
---
what does OP mean by this? 
---
We‚Äôve got a few content patches here and there. Player owned structures like Citadels have gotten an improvement, and we got instanced pvp and pve in the form of Abyssal space. Few ship balance tweaks, couple QOL changes.
---
The nullsec meta has arguably degraded with the proliferation of Rorqual mining and Supercapitals. Some play styles can ignore some of these of course (or benefit if you‚Äôre really into mining) but it‚Äôs honestly not a good state for the meta. 
---
it even has a red arrow, 10/10 
---
I‚Äôd rather see a 24H deploy timer with a 12H structure vulnerability window added to it. 
---
Is the blue donut still prevelant?
---
1. The Corp Snuff Box is not on that BR
---
2. The Alliance Snuffed Out is also not on that BR (in case you mixed the 2 snuffs up)
---
3. Pen is out is not on that BR
---
4. Templis is not on that BR
---
How are you able to fuck up a BR that much!?
---
What kind of T3C cruiser need a training time as long as a capital -.-
---
I have trained a Loki, have good support skills, every subsystems to V and T2 guns and tank. You just need two months for the hull, then sixteen days for the subsystems, and twenty more days for good Gunnery skills (with T2 racks). That‚Äôs way less then a whole year.
---
AAR to come
---
How is that a trick? clickbait much? It's just one of many config parameters. Nothing tricky about it.
---
contract em all to me, ill take em 
---
Because the plot happens to look nice when you do that.
---
There‚Äôs been a bit of a mix up with smaller regional conflicts like the ongoing China v Russia as well as the North/South divide of TAPI+Goons vs Panfam but there‚Äôs nothing really promising to shake things up further. Supercaps still get tossed around and all that.
---
The emergence of SkillUrself and eviction of the DRF has been a major political shift though, but the exact political alignments aren‚Äôt the most clear. 
---
It makes perfect sense when you factor in the value of the asset. Medium structures are basically the same value as a pimped out battleship, should they have a damage cap? Remove their damage cap, buff their HP by 50%, and make them remote repairable. Forcing 30+ people to sit there for 45 minutes shooting an undefended structure is not good game play. Hell, make the damage cap a button someone has to push. I'd be fine with that.
---
So people would go back to the thing that citadels are meant to replace? Sounds like a good balance change to me then.
---
Last I was told, buying the pack was costing you more money than buying a hurricane on market.
---
Yes but the anchoring structure still has the damage cap...
---
off topic but brilliant
---
Let‚Äôs be honest. Not having a damage cap is really stupid. 
---
&gt;jump 5 titans out of the 500 your alliance has.
---
&gt;DD
---
&gt;ref/kill citadel instant
---
&gt;warp off
---
&gt;have some fax/supers ready just in case. 
---
Well, I didn't engage much on the discord server and lost interest in the so called "wardec community" very fast. I don't know many happenings but from my short time being there (and trying to argue with people on the eve forums about my wardec proposal), I can only say the picture drawn by OP makes sense to me.  
---
The Wardec community seems to be formed mostly by the people (ab-)using the wardecs currently, so it is no wonder they do have a very specific point of view on the mechanics and their solutions. The problem is, that a lot of them also don't like other opinions. So if try to throw in something new, they either play the veteran card "we have heard that a thousand times already" or find reasons why you can't know anything about wardecs at all. At least, that was my experience. Seeing them planned-picking on people in the forums is no suprise to me, especially when you think about what they are doing in the game :D  
---
So, yeah. I really like to see that CCP doesn't shy away from actions that are against the ideas of a big part of the "wardec community".
---
Fun fact, this screen shot was taken mid warp.
---
If you're actually moon mining a fit and rigged athanor actually runs you 2.5-6bil depending. Perhaps the answer here is in order to get a damage cap, you have to be fully fit? I'm just sick of the random "Hey I'll just anchor this raitaru and if it dies who cares cause it's 500mil."
---
I will forever dream of walking in stations coming back. I miss my captains quarters still to this day. I wish they just kept a piece of the code i can run on the side while im docked still
---
Came expecting salt about the proposed changes. Was happy to discover a much more reasonable post and one I can agree with. There are some truly toxic shitheads in high sec who are too pussy to venture out of high sec but just love to stomp those not ready to or capable of fighting back. Wars are great. High sec wars could also be great but change has been needed for a long time to limit the level of abuse the system has recieved.
---
wut
---
Hey Allbur, long time no see. How's NS treating you?
---
__why come this guy not can read good, is has not good?__
---
Yes lets be honest. People complain about supers/titans damage application to small targets, while simultaneously defending their inability to effectively siege large ones. Damage cap or not, if we decide to drop 500 titans on it, it's fucking dead. Forcing players to wait some arbitrary time period isn't really benefiting anyone. It's giving you the illusion that the structure is somehow defend-able, and it's not. Your only option is to completely force the enemy fleet off the field. So really what is wrong with deleting a 500 mil raitaru? Hell mining drones cost twice as much as that.
---
Well, first of all that is a better proposal than just "remove dmg cap".
---
Second of all, no. Especially on smaller structures it's important to have that cap to no let it get blobbed away by big groups. Being there for some times makes sure the defenders can start an engagement (and have time to organize reinforcements etc, if something happens they haven't planned for).
---
Yes, sitting there for 45minutes is really bad, allowing someone to nuke a structure would be really bad. The "button press" thing is not a totally bad idea though, make it at least that someone needs to be active. Make the cap dmg something that is an active module on the structure like a weapon that needs to be pushed down etc.
---
I could also imagine some sort of a dmg cap that grows if constantly reached. Something like every minute the dmg cap is completely triggered, it increases by 25% or smth. That way the bashing would be a lot(!) faster and the defender would still be motivated to try to break the enemy dps to safe the structure.
---
But again, removing it won't be a good thing. 
---
You really think there weren't many bots 3 years ago?
---
It's also assuming that theres no price increases month to month, as theres a delay between expenses and payback, in which the price can rise.
---
oh hai thur
---
"Cultural problem" Dude you're getting bullied because you act like a sperg and people make fun of you for it. Your response is to sperg even harder and play the victim. Honestly, what did you *expect* to happen? 
---
Clicking on that link on mobile opens a "Congrats Iphone user, you just won..." site that you cannot leave.
---
Is that reddits or CCP's issue?
---
MANY WELPS
---
And what do you think this would solve? The citadel spam of big alliances? Maybe..
---
It would also mean that small corps would get deleted out of every piece of space because big alliances ‚Äúnuke‚Äù their citadels.
---
Citadels also provoke fights which is definately something that makes people entertained. Tired of people dropping citadels in your space? Just destroy them on the hull timer. Takes 5 people in leshaks to reach dps, get some. Coffee and do the dishes and it‚Äôs gone. 
---
Mental illness is no joke. He's been at this for over a year now.

I for one appreciate you appreciating Drek fleets!

If you do the sites properly it is unlikely you're going to lose your ship and your pod unless you get DC'd or you do something stupid like run a higher tier site 1000km off Jita 4-4 and turn suspect
---
I would suggest doing lower tier sites in a less blingy ship until you're confident enough to tackle the ones with the best payout.
---
&gt;words on a screen make me have bad fee fees

That awkward moment  it happened in Kor Azor :p

Reddit's, probably. It's a direct link to CCP's site, which doesn't have advertising on it.

Eve's Server has been 64 bit since 2010. (bits have been 64 bit for a decade)

Yes. If you dont waste time in pve.

Beating up newbros and hiding like a bitch when they fight back is not insight. It's pathetic.
---
It's a group of a scumbags taking advantage of a poorly designed system. Also pathetic.
---
It's jumping PIRAT taking out a few dudes and they never wardec you again because of it. Really pathetic.
---
Basically pathetic.
---
Kneelo knight doing goons bidding

true for all MMOs really. Good luck to us all

Not *quite*.

That‚Äôs true, a sale or two could swing the profitability of SP farms. I was just showing that investment vs return isn‚Äôt really there anymore until the markets change

I could probably find something to Ebay for $15 a month, with about 1 hours total effort. lol

---
Another highsec pvp that u might not snore. 
---
Only 2 mids on the punisher, friendo
---
Yes! So my first day back in Pirat was that armor timer for the Galeh (sp?) Fortizar. The fight was horribly one-sided aside from the fact that the FC pulled a Leeroy Jenkins with his Bhaalgorn. It was the most fun I had had in a war since... the last fight we had on a structure (we lost). So when the fight was over in Galeh it took all of an hour before their ‚Äúanti-Pirat‚Äù coalition crumbled and I believe one group imploded. 
---
Afterwards we were chuckling on TS and I said to everyone, ‚Äúcrazy how one loss cause them to disband their coalition and an alliance to split up‚Äù. Then another member chimed in and said, ‚Äúyeah unfortunately we just shot ourselves in the foot for that type of content from them‚Äù. I was left afterwards wondering if we should have held back. Should we have down shipped? Maybe we should have honeypotted the fight hoping there was a 3rd party we could escalate against and warp in the rest of the fleet?
---
All of us had fun on our end, and we were a bit bummed when we realized that they were no longer going to bring a fight. I would love and support anything that incentivized people to work together.
---
Being able to rep people that share a mutual war just makes sense. 
---
Looks like Wyvern and Chimera killed by nano-gay RagnaHel and bunch of caps
---
sorry. Next one will be better.
---
For anyone wondering they they typoed gigabytes, they didn't.
---
A gigabyte, strictly, is 1000 megabytes, which is 1000 kilobytes, which is 1000 bytes. Hard drives use this definition.
---
a gibibyte is 1024 mebibytes, which is 1024 kibibytes, which is 1024 bytes.
---
*Most* people mean gibibytes, when they say gigabytes. because gibibyte sounds dumb.
---
you know the cause of the boot.ini issue?
---
They literally have super losses to NPCs
---
Is fitting any of the Assault Cruisers with 100mn AB a good idea or is the MWD penalty reduction big enough that it's not justified to use AB?
---
You have to look at it from the defenders point of view and anything that makes them more likely to fight and RR is an important part of that so if you bring a load of disparate groups in to fight and they are all bit part players with small groups of contained logi within each group on major fights then they will lose.   There is no if's about it.   So CCP went for objectives but then tied both hands behind their back.    I like these changes but overall but this one kills it for me in terms of getting people able and willing to fight and that is the real battle as your return example shows.
---
And couldn't be replaced without replacing *everything* else at the cost of hundreds of thousands, I suspect.
---
said structure worth 500 mill takes 1/3rd the length of time you claim
---
&gt; I suggested a CONCORD office in a defined structure which controlled all the war decs above five wardecs and if the structure was destroyed only five war decs were left live.
---
I think this is a good next step for WarDecs, there is an inherent flaw in the design right now in that the current citadel we have are not designed with wars in mind, the anchoring and reinforcing times are inconvenient, and they set too high a barrier to many entity to participate in warfare and that shouldn't be the case in High-Sec.
---
Anyway, there is work to be done, and that goes in that direction in my opinion.
---
&gt; Also when I joined the war dec discord I made it clear that I had not war decked much
---
The point was that even though we had not wardecced much, our opinion of the thing was not worthless. But we know how that turned out, it was pretty clear it was merely a talking point to prevent any work being done on WarDec, they were the experts so only them could tell what needed to happen, and more of the same was what was needed.
---
&gt; I realized that it was a totally zero sum game trying to make them think, especially as I was spending more time fending off more and more hysterical and personal attacks by Sol and Dom aided in part by Noregen.
---
&gt; Noragen
---
Oh yes, that guy.
---
I actually went pretty light on him, he was certainly an enabler for their attitude. I think I should make him the subject of my next shitpost, we have time before the week-end :p.
---
&gt; Thankfully Bric seems to have done a very good job on this
---
Brisc took some shit too, pretty well remember that, I have seen some of their conversations with Sol and Imawreckyou, that was special lol.
---
But hey, it's part of his obligations as CSM so I guess he should be okay with that. But yeah for the common person at one point it's no longer worth it.
---
OP means original poster =D
---
Thanks and I technically you can but you'd have to do it manually so it's pretty tedious.  
---
If I were to add pvp it would be alongside a point system, real time controls, accounts, elo, some form of progression and verification for fleets ect.  
---
I've got a pretty good idea how I'd set it up but sadly it's not practical.  
---
It would take an awful lot of time to do well and the way it uses pyfa would make the server costs really painful for something with zero monetization.
---
You mean cringespam?
---
Per timer, sure. But there are 3 timers. What is 3 times 1/3 again?
---
Are we beating up new bros? CCP has data that shows that new players aren‚Äôt being targeted by wardecs.
---
You call it poorly designed, and I can say that yes it‚Äôs not perfect, but it serves as a catalyst for conflict in a sandbox. Lots of people use wars for lots of different reasons.
---
If you think an aggressor is pathetic for losing some ships and not re-upp‚Äôing the war then why don‚Äôt you put in a dec to get more content? I assume you had fun or thought it was entertaining, so why limit it?
---
It‚Äôs obvious that not all wars are about standup fights. Like most others we like to fight on our own terms and when it makes sense to us. Of course people get lax or a group puts forth the effort to snare us in a trap and it is great! I‚Äôm sorry we couldn‚Äôt give you the fight or content that you wanted, but I would love for us to be at war again! Maybe when the War HQ goes live you can bring a fleet and try to replicate last times encounter.
---
I‚Äôm personally excited about all these people that talk shit about Pirat because I for one am eager to see what they are made of when we both have proper fleets going at it.
---
just imagine things in the summer
---
I enjoy exploring so much.
---
You have good taste

CCP: Lets make EVE new player friendly by getting rid of the wardec mechanics
---
CODE: Literally ganking noobs and vets everywhere in highsec for salt causing them to quit.
---
CSM: Good job CCP
---
on a low power structure? about 2/5? I don't know why we'd be having this conversation about a high power structure
---
thanks captain obvius 
---
yeah, sure. But both, 64 bit software and dx12, aren't outdated from what i understand.
---
Stop inserting new assumptions just to try to prove your point.
---
Ah. Makes potato mode unnecessary... That'd make more sense, yeah.
---
The main problem here is the having pyfa process the fits without it either being painful or needing a centralized server.  
---
Although now that I think about it Squizz would likely be very pissed off if every client does that.
---
IE exactly what the guy I replied to did? lol. 
---
Will you undock and fight though? Or just hours of station games again.
---
Don't read too much into the newbros aren't being deced statement. There has been a ton of misinformation with who said what when and why.
---
As for putting a war Dec on PIRAT, why bother TBH. Way easier ways to get blue balled. Plus we are rarely if ever in HS. We prefer targets that shoot back.
---
Listen just go somewhere else less scetchy. Anywhere any other corp HS or otherwise. PIRAT is pure garbage tier.
---
You do fly some shiny ass ships though.
---
Also do you know how hard it was for us to set traps to kill you guys. We literally had to find another corp you guys decced because you wouldn't undock with us around. We had him fly right through you. We had to find a WH that was open to a spot you frequented. We had to hold guys back for when you popped your neutral logi.
---
I mean fuck man. Your so risk averse it's painful. Your t ash tier non elite pilots absolutely praying on new bros that don't know any better.
---
Why?
---
I don't actually hate wars, this is something some of the people in the discord attributed to me for obvious reasons.
---
What I want is very much a High-Sec full of conflicts, pretty like what FW was in its glory days, and that for a very simple reason, because that's what made me discover EVE's potential when I was that close to quitting.
---
But since it's High-Sec you have to adapt it to a new and coming population, *that's the core of my claim*, you can't just ignore the fact that it is the zone where our newbies spawn, that's why I am adamantly against the elitist take that is wanted for High-Sec, that's the worst place for that.
---
You are right that the structure change will probably benefit you the most, there are some aspects of their current design I have discussed plenty with other people and one of those is that it gives a clear monopoly to who has the biggest keep (literally) and who has the biggest wrecking machine.
---
But there are ways to remedy to this problem.
---
Anyway, I eagerly anticipate your talk tonight, Godspeed.
---
I'd assume that their server side client will also benefit from this rewrite, or I'm hoping at least
---
I still think changing the tracking units from rads/sec to whatever it is now is a travesty. 
---
you need to tab back in to your ferox fleet and shoot the newly broadcasted target.
---
If there's a super vulnerable in this warzone, the first group that can dial up the dreads will send em in.
---
How do you find the website on mobile?  
---
It does already adjust the layout for phones and tablets.  
---
It can be built as an android app but it's just a wrapper around the website so it feels a bit pointless.
---
hey no problem my man...i'm a giver, i like to help when i can..
---
Most def. I mean Red Frog pilots in high sec for example may use this to top up between their hauls to give a bit of extra coin in a typical courier haul.
---
Definitely useful.
---
actually fyi IE stands for id est, which is latin for "that is".
---
Because he would have to put more effort in order to luldunk someone.
---
Yeah I totally see your point. So I think this issue is an important one to hammer out before the actual iteration among the following:
---
- Revamped locator agents / some form of limited functioning watchlist
---
- When running a locate on someone in a citadel it returns the result as them being in space (this is how it is currently and it needs fixing)
---
- More diverse tactical play (Booshing)
---
I think these are good starting points for CCP to work on including the repping allies point. 
---
:)
---
I think it was a worthwhile exercise to go onto that Discord, I get the impression you were trying to do something similar to me which was to at least give them the view of the other side and to try to make them think outside of their own box, but they seemed to take it as something super offensive and acted accordingly.
---
Noragen, the sly one.  :-)  I still rather like him because at least with Rabble he did something, but my god he did like pushing the buttons. Sol is amusingly batshit crazy, while Dom..., poor Dom is the best way of saying it.
---
If we keep on banging away at the facts it will work its way through, though your screen prints were very much in line with my experience.
---
Because it doesn't make any sense ? I mean you can currently get 3 cruisers AND a carrier with fighters, the only difference being that you can't jump to a cyno with the cruisers without a titan (or a BLOPS bridge if those are covops cruisers). You can reship from a carrier already with fleet hangar if you are in a pod.
---
And of all things, carriers are already among the strongest multi-purpose platform in the game, they should be last in receiving gimmicky jump mechanics for cruisers.
---
Wingspan are just bunch of hs dudes pretend to be wormholers. Meh. 
---
It does for the weapons.  
---
I haven't added it for the reps as they are new and pretty niche.
---
Good to know.

That means people i learned it from are using it wrong. :(

You can use bridge but:
---
-You can't jump back.
---
-If you die, the pod moves way too slow and can die too apnd won't respawn in a carrier that is in the middle of a fight.
---
How?  
---
A structure does take 45 minutes to deal with for a 500m killmail lol
---
As a member of the Signal Cartel, I would like to say something..  
---
  
---
I like to explore, and place rescue caches.   
---
Yes and those are fair restriction because the game isn't about introducing gimmick cool sounding feature but balanced one.
---
I felt it would make it much harder to tell what's going on.  
---
It would also be extremely resource intensive and kinda messy on smaller screens.
---
We need to have some sort of watch list capability and Toxic Yaken came up with a very good one on the Eve thread.
---
The Citadel one is giving away free intel, I hear what you say but...
---
Booshing, I rather like it, however in hisec it will get very messy, if we cannot sort out RR or boosts then booshing is just another mess.

I had lots of fun back then with this combo, if your enemy is trying to kill your DPS Frig because he thinks Punisher = low DPS and brick tank &gt; bad idea. The other way round even bad idea ;)

But why? Whelping is fun.

You do know that South Korea isn't a dictatorship.... right? And that China borders with North Korea, not South Korea.... yes? Pearl Abyss is a South Korean company and so it nor it's home country borders with China. 
---
You appear to be getting your panties all bunched up over a fabricated conspiracy theory that only you appear to be able to see. Probably best you just accept you're on your own here, buddy.
---
Never thought of using the autopilot for this. I learned something today.
---
You can reship from ship hanger even if you are in a ship. So long as the current ship doesn't break the rules for being stored in there the 2 ships just switch.
---
The upcoming War HQ will be your opportunity to make us put up or shut up. I hope you take advantage of it.
---
There are a lot of different kinds of players within Pirat. Some are more risk averse than I prefer, while others are gung ho for a fight. I can best relate it to a wormhole group deciding to roll their connection because they don‚Äôt have enough pilots on... or maybe there‚Äôs no interest in a fight at the time?
---
The data I‚Äôm referring to is CCP pilling the data that shows new players do not die at a higher rate to wars than other players... in fact it‚Äôs less. 
---
https://www.evedata.org/killmailStatistics
---
So yes we have players that aren‚Äôt interested in putting their ship at risk and only want to chase the easy shit around Jita, but we also have the ones that do want a fight... but they aren‚Äôt going to willingly walk into your trap. It will be a fight on their terms, and I see nothing wrong with that.
---
A major issue is that numbers we field are really whacky at times. A lot of the times you may think we have a whole gang of pilots but in reality we may have anywhere from 1 - 3, and can you blame them for not wanting to walk into a death trap? The name of the game is about forcing engagements, and dude what you just talked about is something I‚Äôve been complaining about for years. You have no idea how bad I‚Äôve wanted to have a proper fight with Marmite, Riot, and plenty of other groups that used to exist in highsec in the past. This is why I‚Äôm happy about these structure changes... we can hopefully get the fight we have been wanting without the fucking headache of exactly what you‚Äôre talking about.
---
So I appreciate your hostility and the way you view us. It doesn‚Äôt bother me in the least because I‚Äôm playing my game and you‚Äôre playing yours. 
---
Abyssals!

Dear Customer(s),
---
This may as well act as an open letter to all WiNGSPAN Customers. I deeply apologize for the lack of our signature handwritten notes that so many of you have come to look forward to with your deliveries. I would like the qualm any concerns that you may have of illicit business activities due to improper record keeping. We have self-submitted to audits from the Caldari Business Tribunal and the Gallente Commerce Association to demonstrate our transparency and dedication to proper commercial behavior. Both audits show that our business practices are ethical and all proper paperwork is being completed.
---
Due to changes in staffing we have begun to rely on our electronic delivery receipts more often as the staff was having difficulty organizing our handwritten notes (these are found under your character sheet -&gt; interactions -&gt; combat log -&gt; show losses (returns are under the kills tab)). As you can see, we are still sending you all necessary information for your deliveries.
---
*However*, I want to be the first to admit that this has been a failure of our Customer Service V policy as these changes were not fully communicated nor the desires of our customers taken into account with the partial change of delivery receipts. I will be passing this information to the highest levels of management. Your needs and desires matter a lot to us! People have come to expect the Handwritten Delivery Note with every order, and with good reason. I openly admit that we have failed you as customers and that I plan to push for a complete staffing revamp to prevent this in the future. Understand that this will be an ongoing process and if you notice any other issues with our receipt system that you should report it to an agent or via our customer satisfaction survey immediately. 
---
I will be working tirelessly to reorganize and fix these issues because, as always, *"We're Not Happy Until You're Content"*
---
I've just written an open response to the community. These changes in receipts have been due to oversights in a staffing change and I am working as we speak to fix these issues.
---

The Augorors are trying to repair anything on their side that takes damage.  
---
The repairs don't land until they lock the target and in the case of armor reach the end of the repair cycle.  
---
So if you have enough ships they will kill each other before they catch reps.  
---
The Thorax kill each other at lower numbers because the default Thorax fits have awful EHP and resists.
---
Launch a warp to, offline cargo extender during warp.
---
What kind of magic is this ?
---
Thank you for reporting this missed receipt. We have not had any management changes recently, the issues with receipts has been due to staffing changes with improper analysis of the effects it would have on our customers. I wrote an open response to this post that goes into more detail. I do apologize for our failure to serve you as a valued customer.

---
Personally I would push you to try exploring instead of mining. I personally find mining repetitive, boring, and damaging to my game experience. I suggest exploring because it can be very high risk with high rewards as well. One successful run can pay for ten of your ships easily. Consider joining the in-game channel EvE-Scout. There are many experienced players that are willing to help with exploration in that channel.
---
HANDLE IT!

On the flipside, Needlessly popping ten mil of blue pill is annoying, I've got twitchy about a situation and done that waay too many times

Is this some kind of RP?

If you are buffer fit, use a nos instead of a neut in the highs.

If you get the cycle off, you will be able to hold scram on him even while neuted out.

Combine that with Autocannons that are capless and you should at least be able to stand a fighting chance.

Man that reminded me of this one time I was on a completely fresh toon, noticed some fancy faction drones in space, and was like a 1k isk short for buying a full set of combat probes, had to make do with 7.

I wouldnt go minning in high sec in a coveter. Number 1 you will get ganked (use the procure instead). Number 2 its very boring and only encourages bad habbits(going afk thinking you are safe). You will make more isk and learn better surivial skills by doing exploration in low/null

Wouldn't  remove Carriers from pvp as they would work the same without that module equipped.

I appreciate your vision and while I don‚Äôt know what it was like in FW back then, I can imagine it was nice. 
---
I totally understand that Highsec is where our new players start and while I admit that are / were some groups that specifically and exclusively targeted the low-hanging fruit - Eve Onlines new players. Really what the issue is in my opinion is that the content and pvp in highsec should mean something. It‚Äôs hard to get pvp-minded people to want to pvp in highsec because of how high the barrier to entry is. I admit that it‚Äôs of our own manufacturing when we have all we have at our disposal and to compete you gotta be on par... but if CCP managed to bring reason and cause into highsec and the will / want to pvp and defend your stuff then maybe it wouldn‚Äôt just be the lions preying in the antelope. Maybe there would be more lions around that like to go after other packs of lions...
---
It would be easy to say that we are retards and that we just need to go to another area of space, but understand that at least for me (and I know many many others that share my sentiment) I don‚Äôt really feel like being forced to compete in Capitals Online. I like being able to have relative control of the engagement and I feel that type of experience is one that is non-existent in other areas of space. The only exception to this is Wormholes, and it‚Äôs an area of space that I absolutely love. If something were to happen to our ability to enjoy what we do in Highsec I would hope my friends would adapt and shift towards wormholes.
---
Try getting some of those stem cells and not reading Carrier posts anymore.

Abyssal modules. Theres now more choice for damage amplification modules, which will be relevant for your PVE boat. You'll be able to check them out on contracts, and depending on how good the rolls are, you may find modules far better than what you would have fit previously,etc.
---
I agree only if we remove supers from the game.
---
literally unplayable

Why dont you just get your 3 friends to bring actual cruisers? Oh its because your tackled in a haven and they wont come unless cyno'd directly on you. Terrible idea.

This is a tough one actually if your casually playing i imagine you dont have much time to roam your best bet is sitting in a plex in a hot spot system or near one i.e huola/Kourm/Kamala but i find its pretty 50/50 there as to whether you will get a fair fight. What i tend to do is do laps of the whole Minmmatar/Amarr war zone which results in average around 2 fights an hour.
---
Tried it for about a month, found that it was always one side just station camping the other side and mocking them when they died 5 vs 1.  After all the good I heard was very disappointing.
---
I never got tackled and was thinking that this idea would promote small gang fights instead of caps with just npc fighters dropped.
---
This can happen if you over overheat your cargo expanders.
---
does that mean we are making fits together again? =D
---
Disappointing.
---
&gt; Players are not permitted to make adjustments to the overview settings or hotkeys, they must fly with the default setup provided.
---
Hahaha, that's so insanely stupid.
---
Yeah, more or less. Also the speed of warping off by having the bookmark preselected is nice
---
I will check out Toxics proposal on that.
---
I disagree that it‚Äôs free intel. Currently if you run a locate on a player that is in a station it will tell you that he‚Äôs in whatever station. The same should be for Upwell structures, instead of having to consider the possibility that they are just cloaked in space somewhere. Running a locate on someone that is in a Citadel should return the same kind of result as someone in a station - not just say that they are somewhere in space.
---
Booshing! I don‚Äôt think it has to be messy. I think it can be accomplished with some conditional statement programming. We already have modules that function this way, such as a HIC bubble and other things that aren‚Äôt allowed in Highsec.
---
The way I imagine it working would be as so:
---
Let‚Äôs say you have 5 pilots around you in your Command Destroyer. You have a limited engagement with 1 via a duel, are at war with 2, and the other 2 are neutral scouts or something. You spool up your boosh and away you go with the 3 pilots that you had clear, legal aggression with (able to engage with a green safety).
---
If legal aggression=yes; then boosh
---
The other option is to openly allow Booshing but make it a criminal level offense that starts from the moment you activate your boosh. I don‚Äôt necessarily think it‚Äôs good gameplay to have to sacrifice a ship like a CD to accomplish a tactical goal or advantage, but it‚Äôs necessary I can justify the cost. I agree that this is the messy way to do it, but you gotta admit that the chaos would be great!
---
It also opens up counter-play to a specific ganking mechanic you dislike ;)
---
That depends on a few more things. First of all it depends on your skills, some of the trading skills are exclusive to omega accounts so even if you have them all maxed they don't count in alpha status. Then it depends where you are trading, in NPC station the standing towards the owner faction matters and in citadels the taxes set by the owner can be a big factor.
---
A quick selection that got me when i returned: 
---
1) EFT is not longer a thing :( but in some good news theres a reasonable in-game fitting tool (simulate) it takes some getting used too, multi-buy also helps you quickly purchase your fits(beware using this with faction mods etc... you can end up accidently over paying). There are some offline alternatives that offer more information like damage profiles that would help a mission runner (PY? forgot its name).
---
2) Scan interface/Abnormalities have changed. You'll see them appear on your overview which was a little weird.
---
3) Burner missions. You might have seen these before you quit. These involve a single super frig, These come in 4 configurations (once you know which one your fighting, match your resist profiles) but almost always have super speed/tank and dps. You can dodge these missions but they are kinda fun and a change of pace.
---
Another little tip if your worrried about unfair fights or people calling backup to your 1v1 run a ship with a lot of range control that way you can perhaps pull range to escape i.e. Arty dual web firetail/Dual web vigil fleet/Dual web Merlin and kestrel basically anything with dual webs and a ab granted you need to watch out for bait with dual webs but this is pretty rare in my experiences.
---
I‚Äôd be willing to bet it *didn‚Äôt* work pretty ducking well before, just nobody bothered doing it with trial accounts. And how do you suggest CCP stop people from using VPNs or multiple computers?

---
This issue presents itself with any non-zero tax rate. It's pretty serious as 10K ISK could go a long way.
---
It will have no effect server side, unless you count reducing mass disconnect/reconnect in big fights due to the clients crashing from limited memory. 
---
DX12 should also improve graphics preformance if they optimize it well.
---
But it wont do much to reduce server load or anything like that. The main simulation thread of EVE is still a single thread. You cant multithread a 4k+ fleet fight. 
---
The only thing they could do is rewrite the server code in something more efficient than stackless python... Which would basically mean rewriting all of EVE's code from scratch. 
---
Unfortunate that only ticket holders can participate in a tournament of a spaceship internet MMO.
---
Additionally, this reads to me that AT is going to be dead forever and will maybe replaced by something:
---
&gt;To be clear, this series is not designed nor intended to replace or fill  the gap made by the Alliance Tournament taking a break in 2019. Rest  assured, CCP is committed to carrying on the tradition of yearly Alliance contests in the future that many players get to love.  
---
might have better luck with a Tormentor? Dunno where you're fighting but it's a fucking beast in lowsec :)

Many thanks, that sounds acceptable.

Just trade hubs travelling and trying to clean up but other characters are unavailable for this work so using an alpha.

as the other poster said 1%, if its around that then its ok.

Funny enough the punisher gets a bonus to armor resist but No laser bonus.  Which is why auto cannons are viable 
---
I've thought about a few ways of simplifying the UI with regards to the overview and all the other parts of the UI that stuff appears on (directional scanner, watch list) but it just gets complicated fast. Basically rolling everything into the overview, adding the extra functionality like directional scan, watchlist then allowing as many overviews as we need. 
---
Improving the UI and particularly the overview is gonna be particularly impossible.
---
I was thinking the other day that the sort by on the overview should be by tab. Like you I think shifting some stuff to by tab would be useful but could at this point cause confusion for some of the player base.
---
Should come out this year.
---
CCP rarely cancels projects that other people are working and paying for.

i just told it from my point of view so i stand with it. Iam least i can be glad to made you a good laugh with it :)

Still i dont get whats funny about making terrible rl jokes to harras a person on a lvl to harm their mind. And mostly when i see it happen it is someone from GSF and other major block alliances involved. Like the retarded jokes about Vile rat. I personaly didnt know him even while i played in the same time he was alive but this shit is stuff which dosnt belong in a conversation no matter where this conversation is happening.

I just wanted to be honest.

Probably forgotten like alliance tournament.
---
You can still access your ships through inventory if you find it easier, it really just gives you more options and in most cases is a very handy shortcut even with a ton of ships.
---
Or you can just not be shit and fly 4 Haw dreads
---
Also you have this ability on titans and rorquals and literally no one uses it because its trash
---
I got lost in YouTube after seeing this comment. Ended with college humor‚Äôs Tetris god. 
---
&gt;In the future. 
---
Lol they don't even bother pretending the at is goinng to be back in 2020.
---
Hold the fucking phone, mobile Eve for reals? I thought it was a troll. Thanks mobile Runescape, but you are no longer needed.
---
This sound a lot like bullshit.
---
Bugs are fine but dont break the game for an update is what im saying.  Look at the local comms system great on paper terrible in practice, but didnt break the game, just gave null a wormhole feeling.. Which was kinda fun
---
Well of course you don‚Äôt *need* slaves but it‚Äôs way more hilarious with them plugged in. Also interesting choice going prop-less. I do a compact 1mn for a tid bit of versatility but I would still get screwed by a smart MWD kiter. 
---
I'll second that. of course its personal preference, but exploration (especially if you go to null or wspace) is the most thrilling thing to do as a new player. and its still thrilling even if you have some experience. 
---
i never said s korea bordered with china. i never said south korea was a dictatorship. if you think that china has no influence in south korea, you arent kidding anyone but yourself
---
Thanks!
---
Well I didn't know that, but I was referring to the TiDi thing
---
Tech 1 cant melt 800mm reinforced steel plates. Self destruct was an inside job.
---
Reeeee
---
Have you heard of this thing RL? It happens there too, lol.
---
Let me help you with that... No SLI and 2 games that support rtx but are not playable with RTX Enabled...
---
Is this a troll post? 
---
I have a hard time seeing a mobile derivate of EvE not being a full-blown P2W digital dickpicfest pissing on everything we loved and cared about from EvE. 
---
There is a slim chance it will not be this bad. But i will not believe until i see that.
---
Careful. We'll end up with mutaplasmid expanders next, and people hauling carriers through niarja.
---
However multithreading has nothing to do with 64bit architecture... The newer architecture will allow more memory to be allocated to the game, so not having to swap between ssd and ram, so things like jumping into 6000 plus people might not crash the game... But will not speed up Tidi in anyway possible.. 
---
I just listened tp that 4 times in a row. What have you done to me?
---
New Goon mod removed this ban to keep you posting.         
---
When did you check the mod list last time?
---
well yeah, that's totally a bait fit to hold people while your 40k players coalition come fuck the target up, but I've had some hilarious solo kills with it in the past, mostly from brawlers that get outbrawled.
---
I think Borvil is to busty mining to cause enough drama. 
---
?
---
I can picture a Triglavian industrial with a cargo hold that gets bigger the longer it's flown around.
---
How not to do damage control 101
---
Or tethering.
---
Yea. Against test or goons right? Or any alliance with more than 10
---
Members
---
Where were you when r/eve went full retard on "CCP USING RESOURCES FOR MOBILE GAMES REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE" right after CCP said it's being paid and developed by TenCent?
---
Right, I was talking about the small energy turret activation cost bonus. For some reason I can't resist wanting to make the most of it. Autocannons have more flexible ammo so maybe I should just get over it but idk &gt;w&lt;
---
Because as well all know TEST and goons live in low sec which is already soooo ‚Äúovercrowded‚Äù
---
Guess snuff structures will do then?
---
Yeah but apparently it's set in an "alternate New Eden" https://youtu.be/kw6BcQtszj0
---
One of many new ships, few new classes like t3 destroyer and few new factions, like triglavian, sisters of eve and whatever the Marshall comes under 
---
Because apparently whole LS is filled only with Snuff structures, just take a random  trip through LS it‚Äôs full of low powered citadels
---
&gt;going back to a predecesor that‚Äôs about to be phased out
---
&gt;good thing
---
ah alright, gonna wait patiently then i guess :) 
---
Just started playing last week, after 7 years playing ONLY Guild Wars 2. And I am 100% loving the complexity of Eve. It is so amazing how much there is to explore!! 
---
oh no this is no troll post, im genuinely excited to experience eve on mobile. it may sound strange to you but i don't have much free time to spend with a pc nowadays 
---
Nah, not really resource intensive. Considering it's just a replay that'd not be an issue and the gfx are absolutely not out of reach of webgl2. CCP even provides literally everything needed for this in their webgl-library.
---
The real issue is the effort of making a 3d battle simulator a thing and actually getting it right enough to make sense visually.
---
Unfueled structures should NOT have tether.EVER.
---
 Change MY mind.
---
some stuff should spill out of your cargo if that happens 
---
&gt; the tradition of yearly Alliance contests in the future that many players get to love.
---
Who said anything about PvP contest ? Mining ledgers competition ladies and gentlemen !
---
OK, i admire your hope that it would be a decent game. 
---
The use case for switching targets is that sometimes you want to thin out the hostile dps ships first, then switch to their logi once that starts to slow down, then mop up the rest of the hostile fleet. You could try making it an option that people could use?
---
Also, some more feedback;
---
- it'd be awesome to see some more data during the battle, like the range between the nearest ships of both fleets, the current damage application, etcetera
---
- It'd be nice to get some tooltips for things like range, speed with/without propmod, etcetera. 
---
- It'd be cool to have a list of imported fits like in the ship selection where you can easily remove or rename them. Right now you have to select a fit from the dropdown menu to delete it, but if two fits have the same name you don't know which is which.
---
I'm not huge on the "Eve is dead if there is no AT", but that's pretty bad in the terms of "see we still care" side.
---
+
---
uh..."expensive cruisers"?
---
unless your refering to t2 cruisers, or blinged out t1.   fighters typically more expensive. specially if you use t2 fighters
---
Yes, blinged T2
---
You can now make a tax evasion corp and as long as you do not own structures you can't be war decced is a change you might notice in high sec. As with everything in HS if the isk total fitted to your ship is above 2x the cost to gank it then you will have a high risk of being ganked.
---
Fuck everyone sells out to ten cent nowadays huh?
---
This. It's no fun staring at 100+ days of skills that don't get you into any new ships/weapons.
---
For the OP, check out https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Support_skills#The_80.2F20_Rule_of_Skill_Training
---
They'll just use the inevitable failure of this shitty tournament as an excuse not to have to organize another AT
---
Highsec wardeccers used to whine that carebears that wanted changes to the mechanics should harden up and fight them.
---
Now with the War HQ mechanism, they have a chance to put their money where their mouth is and see if they can defend against organized war targets striking their structures,rather than just farming ganks.
---
Day 1370: They know I have no idea what I am doing and they still want me in charge of things.

CCP:"A literal 1:1 copy of eve online but it's for mobile.
---
... Oh, by the way it only uses the singularity server."
---
Trial accounts were 3 weeks max before and there were no injectors, I have no doubt that it happened before but it was a much bigger pain in the ass to do and the available activities were severely limited. 
---
T2 Amarr explosive resist is its highest resist, and the rats do omni damage so keep the EANM. 
---
Personally I go dual webs only in dark filaments and 1 web 1 missile guidance computer w/ missile precision script for everything else, hadn't actually thought of a TP.
---
T2s in a Sac are stupidly easy too, so you can drop a repper for another ballistic control system and fit a 50mn MWD and as long as you shoot the right stuff first and fly it semi-decently you will have no real issues, I get wanting to be tanky as fuck but once you get a feel for it it's something to consider as it will significantly reduce your clear times.
---
You know what? I will. I wil do that because that‚Äôs gonna save me alot of isk if that‚Äôs the case. Just gotta find a way to get out loot.
---
Seriously good write-up of the Drifter lore. Thank you! 
---
I think it's to do with Chinese licensing laws, they're super strict on foreign companies setting up shop without shitloads of conceasions so it's probably easier for game companies to hook up with established Chinese producers to get that sweet sweet Asian market.
---
tldr
---
Yeahh you‚Äôre probably right. Lot easier to censor everything once you own everything
---
Nah, what we need is resistance on capitals to small weapons.         
---
&gt;Like you can waste as much 9mm ammo on this tank ... but you will not do much damage. 
---
Wally this confirms your a retard
---
Check out eve valkyrie. 
---
A Shuttle bus concept for moving pods has been brought up several times by players before now, bit of a pinata for suicide gankers though. 
---
‚ÄúMake them repairable‚Äù
---
No. Fuck you. POS repping is fucking toxic contagious cancer even with FAXes to do it.
---
Lan tournament without qual-games + for ticket holders only. Nice one, gl to stream 1 drunk drake vs. 2 slashers from highsec belts. 
---
I wouldn't boost torp damage specifically, but rather large weapons that would be specific for anti capital work. 1400mm artillery. Large rails. Cruise missiles. Heavy beams. The idea of a bomber doing 3k dps to a carrier is fun and all, but the notion of 3 men in bombers flatlining a carrier in a minute is a bit extreme.
---
G‚Äôday man!
---
Things are going great.  
---
Lots of mining and super capitals.  Pretty much what we do in Delve these days. That said, every time a WH opens up in my system I check my Rorquals to see if I need a munitions delivery from my old friends at WDS. :-!
---
Hope things are going great for you as well.   I will be at EveVegas and Eve Down Under this year so hopefully you all will be there. 
---
yea lol. 
---
No but i mean they could work like very limited (because of the hangar limit)  and more dangerous to use (because of bunching things together)  titan bridges.   
---
Aside for these technical/design issues - do you think they will impact gameplay that much ?
---
Yep maybe it is also good idea.         
---
You need to use heavy ships to take down a carrier, but carrier cannot do much to you (and vice versa) if you are in some small ship (cruiser and below)
---
Remove tether from current upwell structures that are dockable and add something for caps that provides something closer to pos shields (so you can eject and "safely" leave a ship behind) as forward staging.
---
This could be another interesting "mobile base idea".   
---
But I was thinking more like fitting some sort of "proper docking" system on the current carriers without modifying any other of their properties.   
---
You would just be able to "dock" in them with your ship, like at a station, instead of just depositing your ship like it is now. You could dock within the available fleet hangar space, of course. 
---
Nope.
---
That's embarrassing https://zkillboard.com/kill/75397972/
---
&gt;Forcing 30+ people to sit there for 45 minutes shooting an undefended structure is not good game play.
---
lol, this has always been EVE
---
It also just made the math easier lol 2^(64-30)
---
We have to have something amusing to read while zombie mining.
---
Less confusing BR with sorted entities, BL and CFC together as 3rd party.
---
Thanks
---
I've changed the setup, can run stable 
---
Now to try it out, I'm pretty hopeless shooting the right stuff first, that's my problem :)

I imagine something like panic or capital EDC modules to stretch out the timer by x (5?) minutes if manually pressed. It gives an active defender some extra time to get their shit in order and into position for an organized defense but otherwise the attacker can just blap it.
---
But it puts ships on grid that are engagable. 
---
What do you mean by autolink things? I'm new and I think what you might say could be huge for me.
---
I'm not the one doing the cherry picking hahahah
---
That "mud" you had on us really is just puddle water üòÇ
---
I‚Äôd love the idea. Might not see much use for big groups but can very effectively be used for smaller gang like the old
---
Days where you had a small fleet and maybe 1 cap, 
---
You already stated some of the bigger issues which would need to be fixed correctly but overall I really dig the idea of a carrier being able
---
To carry other ships for capsuleers for example.
---
&gt;A selection of pre-determined ships and fittings that will be different each time and announce 48 hours before the tournament start.
---
lmao
---
Russia 
---
How many small groups currently hold strucutres in hostile space of big alliances?     
---
There might be some who use it a forward staging for harassment. But they write the structure off as soon as deployed right now amyway. 
---
And most of those groups don't bother and use NPC stations in proximity of their target space. 
---
If you want loot from Citadels, you have to go to a wormhole. K-Space Citadels have asset safety and thus no loot. Except you call the cheap fit crap from med sized low power citas loot as this is the only drop.
---
Everything in its place.
---
This is pretty close.  I missed the first half of this liberty fleet, but managed to catch it on it's way back through our staging system.  We started going in the opposite direction from where I'm usually used to shooting things, and I knew I was in for a ride.
---
The hilarious part is we basically showed up and shot phorde, phorde, and then some rattlesnakes.  Everyone shooting the fort left, so we were like uh, okay?  I guess we have to kill this now?  Bumping the Aeon out of tether just made it even more surreal.  LSH showing up as the dreadbomb \*not\* shooting us basically put us in an alternate dimension.  Quite possibly the weirdest and most fun fleet I've been on in a long time.   
---
Fort was apparently same alliance/guy as the aeon, and as far as I know he whored on his own super loss.  
---
Mhh... I definately like the idea that the defense must be active. If you dont fight for it, it shouldnt be a pain in the ass to deal with it.
---
Although CCP has done a lot in that direction, there is still room for improvements.
---
this week my best eve friend became my boyfriend (‚óï‚Äø‚óï‚úø)
---
i don‚Äôt have any unrealistic expectations that this is going to last forever or be easy, but i love him very much and think we‚Äôre going to do our best to make it work.
---
here‚Äôs to you, u/Tikktokk &lt;3
---
i hope ccp actually fixes their game, i started playing again and it's almost on par with what i expected going in!
---
Have you tried reading your ideas out loud to yourself before inflicting them on the rest of us?
---
*looks at the top of the page, confirms we are still on reddit, looks around uncomfortably*
---
it's a trap, run, you fools...
---
No, you aim to please a specific group not the whole population...
---
Yes they sounded very good, have you ever thought you are just panicked of the idea of change?
---
trump\_wrong.mp3
---
[https://www.evedata.org/killmailStatistics](https://www.evedata.org/killmailStatistics)
---
The mooring that ccp first proposed would be nice
---
Yea I think it will also add a bit to the "deception" part of things which is commonly used for small gang fights. Would I engage this carrier? It says it has 4 people logged in - are they in cruisers? Are they in battleships? etc.   
---
You could maybe scan that but it will just tell you all the ships in there not the ones actively occupied so an extra layer of deception.   
---
Idk, I expect someone to come around with a very obvious reason as to why this is completely retarded but so far I haven't been able to come up with one :) 
---
Just remove them
---
So uhm, I know this is friendship thread but...  PL is dead and NC doesnt undock. Thanks for reading, have a nice day.
---
I do both, but since wormholes are too scary for me, I can only go hunting like once a week because I need my kills to get off the front page of my zkill to have a chance. 
---
Tbh it already looks smoother and better designed than eve. RIP Eve 2.0
---
You talking about the workout holoreel?

---
honestly, while having capitals do that would be a bit much. it does bring up some ideas.
---
capitals can already carry ships, in the ship maintence bay.
---
but having a ship designed around carrying clones (bit like the revival ship of Battlestar galactica)  would make things like nomadic mercenaries alot more feasable.  and add a level of non static combat movement that has been small scale for a while.
---
might be fun to look into something like it.  
---
The flag only comes up after you have repped someone, at the start of the engagement there is no suspect flag and if your neutral logi reps someone with no damage to give themselves a flag your doing it wrong. 
---
By the time the logo is repping, they normally position themselves out of your range and the opposition can change to the logi it is not fair that the neutral logi can decide when they enter the fight.
---
I have given you some incredibly-valuable advice. If you want kind words ask your mommy, your therapist, or some feel-good subreddit where people validate your feelings for you. 
---
We already had something similar with Supers way back in the day.
---
You can still do it with a Titan, you just can't be a poor.
---
I don't believe anything I said was wrong. If it's the "goon overlord" line that (still) makes you salty, ask yourself this: If the rest of Imperium were to suddenly declare war on INIT, do you think your alliance would stand their ground? Not win, but at least give a fight?
---
You'd dissolve your alliance and join as a corp in goons in an instant
---
[Mfw I agree with Stainguy](https://i.redd.it/f46azqiqcg411.jpg)... 
---
This is happening way too often. I'm scared ;_;
---
You're hitting diminishing returns on the DPS rigs with 3 BCS on already. I don't know for sure if application rigs would help more with heavies or not.
---
eh, carriers in their current state na.   but dreadnoughts sure. they already have a harsh enough penalty with the 5 minute immobile, 
---
I don‚Äôt have enough power for a 10mn without dropping other mods. Am I missing a skill?
---
AMA Request: the furious bastard who came up with the original formula
---
I mean, why would they say no when a company wants to lease rights to make an eve spinoff for their own market?
---
this is the 4th time. at this point i've settled on the fact that from time to time his insanity either becomes contagious, or is just crazy enough to work
---
Jeah but prevent ppl from taking out shit once it's reinforced an make it drop all the loot 
---
Autocannons have a 100% cap reduction when ya think about it 
---
I believe this is the ancient magic of "rounding error".
---
Try undocking now.  Good luck 
---
Let's be honest. Unless a dread (s) wins the field, it's not getting out 9 times out of 10.
---
wizardry!!
---
I WORK DURING THE WEEKEND !!
---
I CANNOT PLAY EVE AT WORK !!
---

---
I hope ya'll will have a nice and chill weekend before i come to ruin it.
---
Oh wow here‚Äôs the ‚Äúcute newbie‚Äù shitpost of the day. Why don‚Äôt mods ban these posts?
---
&gt;CCP rarely cancels projects that other people are working and paying for
---
Yeah. Usually the people working and paying them are the ones who cancel them. 
---
Maybe 1% of the time this will be both true and relevant. The other 99% of the time it‚Äôs just going to be ships reverse-bashing a structure with the least engaging gameplay ever invented.
---
You can replace IE with ‚Äúthat is to say‚Äù usually. People like to use it interchangeably with EG which is wrong. EG could be replaced with ‚Äúfor example‚Äù
---
f
---
well..not exactly.
---
my Haw phoenix vs frigates and dessy gangs (yeah....not the most ideal)
---
they'll pull out to 30-40km range, leaving a few tackles closer in and when i come out of siege, if i havent put a dent in them, i'll usually align out if the tackle dead.
---
having built in warp stabs would be nice to encourage more of them to come in range in case i go out of siege and align out.  
---
either that or they could give dreads their role of siege ships again by  changing fking citadels &lt;.&lt;  
---
All that effort for a reference only a dozen people will remember. Tip of the hat to you right there.
---
Hi wally
---
&gt;For those of you who cannot directly participate in the competition, we have prepared a Prediction Bracket Challenge. This little contest will let everyone submit their predictions for a chance to win one of five prizes consisting of swag and codes for digital items in EVE Online.
---
Welcome back betting. Seems like all that "unassailable wealth" reason wasnjust bullshit then? 
---
Yeah, good example. Have a couple of slots for caps anf fewer for supers and titans.
---
Or different sizes.
---
I have four Upwell structures and I still use my POS. Automated defense is a huge asset for me as a tiny Corp. In the 4+ years we've been setup no one has attacked our POS. For comparison, within weeks of anchoring a Fort we were seeded and the fort was destroyed on our next holiday vacation :( 
---
Attackers claim they want fights, but moreover they want easy wins 
---
Where are you running missions in highsec so we can come help you?
---
No, I was just moving some stuff. I actually use the praxis for mining.
---
Also I'm pretty sure they initially had this thing as I can see no explanation for the huge fleet hangar bays they now have. 
---
Wouldn't they just take a wh?
---
They can just leave the auto repair in. If nothing happens, just leave it to auto complete.
---
Back to EvE playlists on youtube I go.
---
Yeah, i have googled that after you pointed it out. Thank you for new knowledge. :)
---
Lear/Wheeler bromance confirmed
---
How do you deploy a bubble on their citadels without them noticing xD
---
I run level 4s in a Cerberus with heavy assaults. 2 BCS IIs and 2 missile guidance IIs in the lows. I switch to javelins for frigs. I'm also running 3 salvage drones. I don't use painters or webs at all and if you okay the mission right you'll be fine. 
---
You should consider rapid light launchers for level 2 missions and light or med drones. Your fibres can take car of the smaller ships. But I wouldn't use 2 webs. If anything just 1 painter. 
---
^^:whispers:
---
Man I wish I was this good. I am just a lonely imperium Skirmish Commander :)
---
Nah, didn‚Äôt you read last week where they flew to a different country to meet up? 
---
I‚Äôve been flying a Charon on auto pilot ferrying shit worth about 1bi for over a year now. Have never gotten targeted.
---
That's another change of the past couple years, the Chinese server got shut down and several Chinese groups (the most relevant being Fraternity) have established themselves on Tranquility.
---
That's far from betting, and they have done it on the AT after betting was banned. If you guess right you get into a sort of lottery with other people for some shitty fixed rewards.
---
FYI you can shift click the ships &amp; item windows, a window will appear that windows setting is kept if you dock/undock in any station.
---
&gt; A selection of pre-determined ships and fittings that will be different each time and announce 48 hours before the tournament start.
---
Nope, it doesn't.
---
i miss playing eve but I don't have the time but i hope you guys enjoy playing
---
If CCP is making fits there's going to be shit like rocket slashers and 1mn ab rail Drakes.
---
This sounds like they're getting rid of the "biomass" description for deleting characters. I hope I'm wrong. What would even be the purpose of that?
---
Pirates form together to protect other pirates. 
---
He bends the very fabric of space and time, like the Talocan.
---
i too use a praxis to move my tritanium, pyerite and salvage around.
---
So the point is to force defenders to bring logo specifically to rep the structure...during the fight only?
---
From **"The untimely death of fellow {corpName} member"** to **"{[character]charID.name, linkify} has retired from active status as a capsuleer"**        
---
With the addition of this :         
---
&gt;Their callsign is now free for use by future graduates from capsule pilot training who wish to be licensed as independent capsuleers.
---
It sounds like a fairly terrible idea, but I guess you can already take someone else's name if you sell them a character.
---
I think the potential for claiming a previous character's name without their direct involvement is pretty iffy. 
---
biomassing already releases the name, they're just rewriting the notification
---
Reduce all structures to this timer imo
---
...
---
i really like the changes
---
big LOL to PIRAT noobs, now they cannot hide in station if a fleet comes to fight...
---
PIRAT and other highsec wardec noob corps can only kill poor victims... its some kind of PvC (player vs carebear)
---
now they have to defend the War HQ or the war is over :)
---
What was that? 
---
Not disputing ypur conclusion, just elaborating.
---
Webs and paints do different things. 
---
Webs obviously slow tje target down, so you don't need as a high explosion velocity on your rockets.
---
Paints bloom the targets signature which does tje same but fpe the explosion radius.
---
Both are important parts of the missile damage formular. But which you need more depends on wether your target is exceedingly slow or small.
---
That only is for missiles. Turrets use a different formular, which i think favors webs more in most cases. 
---
Thank you for the reply
---
Awww, that's so cute :')
---
Good luck you two! 
---
Yeah this. ATM its hardly worth the effort to kill them
---
Hi, i have a Cerb, could you share me your full setup please, thanks
---
a movable clone bay and bowhead/carrier
---
it could be pretty sick to have a swarm of frigs come out of a carrier after they got podded
---
shipping in large swarms of small ships in the middle of a fight and have ppl jump right back in action could be a good counter. fights usualy die down because reshipping takes too long to affect the battle.
---
it will also work great for deployments - jump in several carriers with frigs and cloak up then when the time comes you jump in a "meatwagon" full of pilots that then grab a ship from the carriers and you got a full invasion fleet.
---
it could make a roaming nomad life possible for non sov groups
---
Can we get a part 2? maybe with the back story to do this? https://zkillboard.com/kill/75451335/
---
Try a Micro Auxiliary Power Core 
---
Not sure why you're being downvoted, have an orange arrow! 
---
Damage cap should be an activatable module like an adc. Burns out after 10min or so but it requires an active gunner
---
I used my cloaked Orca's maintenance shed to store angry cloak tengus while I hid in enemy wormholes for months. Fun, but sadly not profitable.
---
yea
---
So any word on treating allies in a wars logi as part of the war? Or are we just going to slap a concord sticker on that and file it under too much effort?
---
U could be right,  Icould either change a BCS for 'C3 xx' this gives more damage to the drones or add another hardner depending on the damage I'll take
---
I think the chances of someone dying in range of a carrier, or not being bubbled, are so low that it's not worth it.
---
It would be so awful to try to pod over to a carrier and reship. It'd be easier to deathclone back, reship and take a bridge.
---
I think pirat will be just fine tbh
---
props to "Pulstar" and their "BarBargain" buddy for fighting us (Even better with friends) yesterday. after a nice roam and getting a phoenix dropped on our amazing 6-man fleet it was a great way to end our roam with that fight. I especially liked the back and fourth until only one guy from us and you were left to fight it out 1v1. great stuff and feel free to join us on "EBWF public" ingame anytime. gf and o7
---
Horrible things. You are doomed. Surrender to your fate.
---
IMO the golden era was just after the back of the technetium stranglehold was broken by redistribution of the r64s, and just before the first iteration of jump fatigue. c.2014 I want to say.
---
üëåüçÜüê∫üí¶
---
Yes you can. Cap boosters can go in sma. Why do you think everyone throws hoarders in their sma.
---
IM JUST CURIOUS ENOUGH TO POST THE SAME QUESTION AGAUN BUT NOT CURIOUS ENOUGH TO READ THE ANSWER. 
---
Man, fuck off with your lazy shit. 
---
Yea, after I wrote that I thought about it for more than half a second. You're right.
---
That's why I said 9 out of 10 times. I too have a fun HAW dread. But also, they need to be mindful of balance when you consider they are used en masse normally. So making them more powerful against citadels on a 1v1 case might look good, but when 200 drop? Well, there are damage caps for a reason I suppose.
---
Do what? What communist wonderland do you live in?
---
Freeing up old names is fine; I just take issue with the (minor and unimportant) bit where they remove the whole "capsuleer is ground into a fine meat paste" bit. 
---
muh grimdark!
---
cuz a astrahus is 1/3 the price and infinitely tankier/larger/safer.
---
Dreads and faxes are usually loaded with haulers loaded with cap booster 3200s.
---
There have been several community proposals over the years about actual supercarrier styled ships which would serve as FOBs providing limited tethering and a huge corporate and fleet hanger, but no offensive weaponry. 
---
&gt;Players are not permitted to make adjustments to the overview settings or hotkeys, they must fly with the default setup provided.
---
Forcing people to use the default overview the the most CCP thing ever.
---
I expected a dismissive response to a presumptive question and I got exactly what I wanted, with a cherry on top. What does that make it?
---
Naw they still drop salvage and jobs.
---
So not gonna lie, 2019 has been a pretty fun year for EVE so far. The AT news was a pretty nasty blow to morale but most of everything else CCP has been doing seems to be moving the game in the right direction (conveniently we will not talk about the Guardians event at all since it basically didn't happen).
---
Lets hope for lots more fun brawls in the near future!
---
Basically like tethering is now, but only for a set number of ships at a time.  It would also persist and 'lock' the ship from others while you ejected and did something else.  
---
I forgot why they bailed on that concept in favor of current tethering.
---
Triglavian Pi haulers? :o
---
I think the best way to deal with the rediculous ammount of citadels in space, remove a damage cap if low power.  That means that if they want their structure to be safe, they have to actually be fueling and using it.  Would remove the whole lel this structure looks nice here but im never going to use it again thing. 
---
Otherwise known as the No One Cares Cup.
---
Hmm tbh, last time i checked it moved char to Doomheim - (at least one that was coming from omega account, alpha acts differently ) but this don't do this often.      
---
New tournament just announced friendo
---
&gt;One thing I really like, is to zoom out, so I can hear the solar wind gusting to and fro. 
---
Lol nice homage there.
---
Yes hopefully it's in addition to the future AT, rather than instead of, since it is in a bit of a different format!
---
Like 200 dreads vs 1 capital ship assembly array pre 2009?
---
Welcome to eve.
---
Of coarse, we could balance it by letting logi rep it
---
i want to say thanks to u/WallymartsEve for being the best poster on reddit
---
also many thanks to novac cone and gofis for being bros and flying lokis with us
---
Most of the times when you die - you will get podded just after.      
---
But on rare occasions people use capitals this way - in bit older days people used carriers sitting in pos shields to reship dictor alts or similar small stuff. 
---
i was really sad when i got sick halfway through our week together (-Ôπè-„ÄÇ)  
---
then you skillfully feathered my heart by taking care of me ‚ô°(‚à©ÀÉoÀÇ‚à©)

love you a bunch and hope we can conquer the atlantic together! /^-^(^ ^*)/

I miss 2007, too.

Not married, no kid, no law school debt, no cancer, no reddit.

Mom's still alive, grandmother's still alive, cat's still alive. 
---
Fuck 2019. This year sucks. 
---
I believe Wingspan switched deliveries. When the delivery man/woman approached me I kindly told them I had ordered drones and antimatter. NOT TORPEDOES!! They threw the torpedoes at me anyways. I am a person of great patience, however your corporation may persuade me to give you a negative yelp review. I hope it will not come to this but I will do what I must to protect other customers.
---
Hey, I like the chuuni shit sometimes. What of it?
---
Better than nothing but I suppose that's not the reddit way.
---
Or am I the only one who read the part about supporting player run tournaments.
---
Remember Anger Games last year?
---
Yeah, me neither.
---
You'll get there dude. Chin up.
---
I hope you quit tomorrow. Eve isn‚Äôt for you. 
---
You are right I should quit because I don‚Äôt want to be a dick on Reddit 
---
I would like if they kept the meat paste but there's a disinformation campaign by Victims of Capsuleers United to convince people that pushing that button actually sends you to a relaxing retirement.
---
So many retarded ideas in one day.
---
I run T4s in a HAM Cerb as well, but I prefer the web over missile guidance comps, especially in Darks. You just blast through things, and Caldari Navy missiles + webbed frigate is usually a 2-3 shot frigate. Plus, having 3 BCSes in the lows increases clear time a lot.
---
The point is to discourage sending 30+ people to take my small Keepstar.

Wally you've outdone yourself this time, smashing journalistic work!

I think they're  heavily over estimating the level of interest in this.

soylent viridi humanum est!
---
This isn't an uncommon feeling. Only rarely is a person looking at a current game and thinking "this is the best gaming experience of my life so far."

For most of us, that experience is in the past somewhere and we're looking to either recapture that feeling or surpass it.

welcome to eve buddy, unplayable without 2 accounts. 3accounts youll feel spoilt.
---
some have so many accounts its wrong.
---
if you love the game i reccomend 2 accounts and if both omega can be active on the one pc at the same time, i do this often,

Wow, way to steal what i said. I literally said all that. Nice copy paste.

Just be cautious.  I hear his favorite ships are the Rapier and the Kinkymora.
---
tfw the tldr is the first sentence
---
That was a great read. I wish CCP would be developing the drifter arc more actively.
---
We're not changing the way that we free up names.
---
This is just a replacement for the old "RIP Corporation Member {[character]charID.name, linkify}" EVEmail that's sent when someone deletes a character when they're part of a player corporation.
---
I requested this change personally and wrote the text for the new EVEmail as we've had a couple of instances recently where players who's first languages weren't English or one of our supported languages were confused.
---
There was a couple of incidents where corporation members contacted me via discord/DM on twitter to ask if a member of the corporation was okay in real life given the EVEmail, so we wanted to make sure we alleviated any worry.
---
EVE is at the age now where sadly the occasional passing of a member of the community is something that happens, so I wanted to change this mail to be different to avoid confusion.
---
The new EVEmail reads as follows in full:
---
&gt; Corporation member [CHARACTERNAME] has retired!
---
&gt; This notification is provided by CONCORD to inform all members of [CORPORATIONNAME] that former member [CHARACTERNAME] has retired from active service as a capsuleer.
---
&gt; Their callsign is now free for use by another individual who graduates from capsuleer training, and their CISC (CONCORD Identification Serial Code) has been removed from the CONCORD Assembly‚Äôs capsuleer tracking database.
---
&gt; Both CONCORD and [CORPORATIONNAME] would like to wish [CHARACTERNAME] all the best in their future endeavours.

RvB has something going every day of the week, either an event or a scheduled low sec roam usually.  It's always casual and fun.  The main difference between RvB and other groups is that RvB is NOT goal-oriented PVP... just PVP for fun.  Low sec fleets hit 20+ and arranged cruiser/BC fights in high sec are often 10 v 10.  1v1s are common and not interfered with. 
---
As others have mentioned in this thread, just join and try it.  We allow people to come and go as they please with no hard feelings, pressure, or hassle to leave/rejoin.  Give it a week, keep an eye on the schedule in RvB Community channel, and grab reships from Jita (only 3 jumps away).  Easy.

See... This is what I'm talking about. It's the little things that made Wingspan a pleasure to do business with! If I wanted just the plain jane audit log receipts I could just go to Goons or Horde for my munitions needs. It's the painstaking craftsmanship and attention to details that make Wingspan a PREMIUM munitions delivery service!

If you lose that... Well then you'd become "just another grey delivery truck".

Ships in the ship maintenance dont get skills applied to increasing cargo hold until you sit in them. Cant put 100 cap booster in an iteron mark v. Also something about a huge pain to eject it out and grab more before someone decides to blap your storage can.

I‚Äôd argue the best Eve years in general were when npc space wasn‚Äôt worthless; nullsec as a whole felt more alive even though there were fewer people playing, since people could carve out a living in nullsec without having to plop down stuctures only to have them be stomped by the bigger fish in the sea.

We use 10mn Muninns sometimes, so in certain scenarios it definitely makes sense. But I haven‚Äôt actually gone on one of those fleets as a Muninn, so I can‚Äôt say much more

If you are very passionate about EVE and want to be around that feel the same, I highly recommend it. As far as the people that you will see at an event, you will see people from all different walks of life. It is also a great place to find a group of players that you would enjoy flying with. 
---
I have been to EVE Vegas a few times and enjoyed it minus the last one I went to but that was because of the venue. 
---
....yes.
---
Just give me an Astrahaus with a jump drive and we gucci.

Could you go around looting them with a ceptor, since you could easily warp in, loot, and run before the rats lock you? Or is there a mechanic to prevent this

Well there was an odd dude in 2014 who spent the whole first day flying a chimera model around
---
it is very good to hear people will receive retirement benefits instead of being killed irl for quitting eve
---
imagine your structure getting 1 shotted by a super fleet though...
---
cause citadels are literally everywhere, even enemy space.
---
cheaper, have free 3 day fuel, reinforce timers, dmg caps, and can store unlimited with perfect asset saftey.
---
so need to reship?  dock at the closest one, usually in system.
---
want to deny enemy access to a citadel?  to bad. in the time it took for you to wait out the reinforce timer, they placed 3 more cause they cheaper than ships.
---
Oh yes, it did take quite a while, but I believe I scored ~10 or 20 mil for them. Cha-ching.
---
2009-2011 here. Wormholes were truly a new, strange frontier to explore that wasn't theorized to death by the launch date. Nullsec was a chaotic mess of alignments roughly broken into 5-6-ish factions, thrown into turmoil by Dominion. The incursion live events crossed community lines to deliver fun.
---
...then came mid-2011 and Incarna.
---
This is dumb.
---
How have I never seen this masterpiece before?!
---
Been to fanfest twice.
---
If you've never done it, I'd say it's worth it. I always do a few extra days so I can do some sight seeing etc so it's a proper holiday.
---
So, if meeting eve nerds doesn't give me value for money, being a tourist does.
---
I would think the developers can generate themselves unassailable (in-game) wealth anyway...
---
It's not a player run being site, whose owners pocket the revenue of. 
---
Does anyone know roughly when the next Singularity mirror is expected? 
---
I kinda think about this whenever T2 Titans come up.
---
So basically, when the player flying the thing is logged on, it's more or less a Titan with a siege module that people can dock in and clone to with a decent amount of HP. Like killable, but can't be instablapped.  Maybe give it a resistance to DDs.
---
When you set siege, it more or less becomes a manned Astrahaus.   Give it a RF timer or two, and IDK about a damage cap.  It should be killable, but not trivial to kill.
---
Also, it should be a shorter spool up then anchoring citadels, but not so short that if you get caught, you can set siege to save yourself.  This one I can't figure out because I think you would want to be able to jump into hostile space and anchor under fire, but not use anchoring to save you from a gank.
---
If the player logs off in space with out an aggro timer, it stays in space and behaves like it's sieged (sieged or not) with RF timers and shit.  If it has aggro, it's just like any other ship until the timer is up.
---
It should behave like a citadel when it dies; anyone docked is kicked out in whatever they are in, and any of their shit follows asset safety rules.  Also, it can't dock with anyone logged off or docked in it. Maybe have the option to kick everyone out and asset safety all their shit.  I'm kinda torn on if it should be able to dock at all, but I feel like if you make it stays in space logged off, you should be able to dock it.
---
Maybe if it logs sieged, it stays in space, but if it logs off out of siege, it kicks everyone out and leaves space.
---
Whatever.  This is just some shit I was thinking about. I think it would be fun to replace the POS you used to drop in a hostile system to stage from in the early parts of an invasion.
---
Not even a madlad. That's the standard BRAVE capital doctrine.
---
In the same boat, dont have time no more with school happening 
---
I don't see what's wrong with War HQ at all...
---
This post but unironically
---
Yep for POWERED Refineries and EC above Raitarus, Astras usually have no jobs running, and most Raitarus also not. as soon as they are low power there can be no jobs and thus no loot except salvage
---
Err,  Ghost riding? 
---
I never once, in 14 years, repped a pos while there were friendly ships to rep or enemies to shoot at. The best defense for a defender POS is to just kill the enemy.
---
same
---
Probably because of POS code or something.
---
Doesn‚Äôt the damage cap do exactly that?
---
same ):
---
Your flair makes my eyes hurt. I love it
---
Makes sense. 
---
Can you clarify the meaning behind the "Their callsign is now free for use by future graduates from capsule pilot training who wish to be licensed as independent capsuleers." 
---
"Now free" suggests the name is immediately released. 
---
Thanks it takes your eyes off my terrible postings 
---
post pictures of your mom please
---
something tells me the both are the opposite of soft when they dock
---
I'm constantly trying new games looking for that high again. I find myself just sitting at my computer for an hour not knowing what to play, and then I just lay down and read. Maby I'm just losing interest in the scene, Maby a new game hasent captivated me yet.
---
theres a bubble around it so anything nullified makes it quite easy i think
---
I always put fleet doctrine sabres in my capital SMAs.
---
Kind of. 
---
There are too many structure bashes  without any player interaction and it doesn't scale in any way. 
---
Really? I kept haulers with stront and lo and boosters in supers but never in regular caps. Regular caps just had sabres and maybe ceptors.
---
if you actually mean 100mn i believe for cruisers those are used for special situations and often require fits that compensate for an oversized ab. As far as mwd vs ab of the right size, depends on situation and how you are engaging
---
&gt; I forgot why they bailed on that concept in favor of current tethering.
---
Mooring wasn't just a prototype for tethering, it was docking for supercaps.
---
Those were ideas from early in the process, before they decided on asset safety or that the biggest stations could dock supercaps. It was a cool idea, but wasn't really compatible with asset safety. The idea with mooring was that supercaps would drop if the structure was destroyed.
---
A related cool idea that they don't have enough development resources to do: having the engineering structures [show supercaps in build](https://content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/70592/1/Engineering_Complex_11.jpg) on the model.
---
Same as always, when you delete a character, the character name becomes available for use again.
---
This has always been the case, and will always continue to be the case.
---
feel the same, best era was from introduction of wormholes with Apocrypha until the backpaddling on jump fatigue after Phoebe patch. With a small downside after Dominion during OTEC. Wormholes were such a thrill and fun mechanic at the start to explore, Tiericide was letting small/med gang meta blossom to its unprecedented high, after Phoebe moonmining was accessible to local entities, letting small/med-size lowsec warfare blossom to the max because you did not need to join a Blob to afford SRP-Programs and so on....
---
Not pastebin, i use a third party programm, like "Windows notepad" to store what you call "trash". I really love spreading my happiness to everyone :)

I've been to many meets, Vegas and Fanfest. I really enjoy it.

There is a bit of awkwardness at first when you arrive and speak with EVE people in RL.  It takes just a moment of adjustment and suddenly you are with your tribe. 
---
You'll meet all kind of EVE players and hear stories and learn new things.  There will probably be a few people that you don't want to hang with, but for the most part everyone is open and nice.

Here is a video I made about attending EVE events: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi0zZ4aW5pw

Removing duplicate post.

ahahaha PIRAT
---
You're objectively more risk averse than high sec miners. In procurers/skiffs. Inside a 1.0 system.
---
Agree. Should also be able to refit in space using a citadels fitting servuce Wasnt that supposed to be one of the benefits to mooring supers on citadels?
---
Can we Kickstart to buy ccp back from the Chinese, preferably also break the current owners knees? 
---
Cyclone pilot here, agreed, this was an amusing fight. Definitely a case of too much tank, not enough dps. We wanted to break the confessor first, naturally, but the hyperion is blaster fit, and the confessor was smart enough not to come too close even when I started kiting him around the hyp.
---
Eventually I also ran out of cap boosters, and didn't have nearly enough natural tank, so I had to bugger off myself back to the citadel.
---
We didn't have to pay for repairs though, so isk positive!
---
On a related note, the ridiculous number of good fights we've had over the last couple weeks is truly impressive. We spent a year and a half in goonswarm as a corp, and we've had more good fights here in highsec the last two weeks than we did in the entire time we were in goons.
---
Off and on player returning...again. All I ever did was mine (HS/LS/NS) previously. Nothing wrong with that but forcing myself to do more. Recently joined a Wormhole Corp and started Exploration and PVP. Still training cloak, can't wait to be that guy I always hated in this game....muwahahahaha
---
What's view boting?
---
For those of us not up to date with the parlance of the times.
---
Literally who...
---
Yep.
---
The guy had over 350 viewers   
---
Avg 200/300 On a brand new stream  
---
View botting is using software and inflating you viewers numbers,
---
It's against the TOS
---
&gt;Sucks i didn't redeem more stuff lol
---
Wasn't that the guy who was RMTing through twitch? If so, that kind of makes you a knowing participant in RMT.
---
Hell yeah
---
Are there any plans to ever release names of inactive characters? :P
---
You needs new flair bait
---
who
---
*Wooo* It's your **5th Cakeday** cordelia_clopton! ^(hug)
---
Was he doing RMT. I didnt know about that tbh i just know u were watching him and he gave you items in game wich is not RMT bcs u coulnd't get items tru money right? Or is that RMT?
---
You could've just googled it. Someone is viewbotting when he pays for a service that brings viewers to his channel that aren't actual humans.
---
Lol, one per region
---
&gt; On a related note, the ridiculous number of good fights we've had over the last couple weeks is truly impressive. We spent a year and a half in goonswarm as a corp, and we've had more good fights here in highsec the last two weeks than we did in the entire time we were in goons.
---
yeah, it's definitely been fun. i was being kinda a dick at the start of the war with disrespect cans etc and i regret that because you guys are alright and we've had a lot of fun. word on the street is that the war will be ending soon, i hope we do it again sometime though
---
Who?
---
Added more information for you guys 
---
Actually makes a lot of sense. It would decrease the effect of timezone tanking, because the first reinforcement will be faster/easier for the attackers.
---
Having 300 viewers is nothing on twitch, so again who?
---
Check the update on the post i just posted is store/ channel
---
no thx
---
That's not how any of this works
---
Life is like a gate camp, sometimes 
---
Yeah, I noticed that but want sure if the equipment and skins made it worthwhile.
---
Any idea about whether Resource War sites are soloable?
---
he *is* very good at dual-boxing, if you know what i mean ;)
---
Did you check is viewers cout? He went from avg 7 viewers to avg over 250 out of nowhere. Doing nothing but having a BRB Screen.
---
It's still valuable (although not as easily comparable), but it'd be better as millirads/s, I think. It'd also make it more 'like' the tracking number for comparison
---
Hmm. Learn something new every day. I thought they were doomheimed and remained as in-use names.
---
&gt; u were watching him and he gave you items in game wich is not RMT bcs u coulnd't get items tru money right?
---
The way the ships were bought was with his "raider points" which could be bought by subbing or donating to his channel. Because subbing and donating both involve real money, that makes it RMT.
---
What happens if a job was running when it runs out of fuel?
---
The upcoming sleeper/drifter event should be interesting
---
Glorious and inspiring. Top notch musical choice.
---
Bumped him off
---
You were also getting points by just sitting on is channel

I'm sorry man.

It's really hard to track technically and there's no way to seperate wars, you could just make a new corporation for your neutral logistic alts, wardec another friendly/alt corporation with your main corp then bring the neutral logi corp in as allys, and have a situation where no-one can engage your logistics corp since the only war in common would be the friendly corp one. So it's complicated. 
---
1 year player here and i fucking love this game more than any other I've ever played
---
Rvb red fed pilot Here.
---
I play now for 3 years from wormhole over nullsec elite ploc.
---
The last 7 month in Rvb are the best in eve ever.
---
I learned solo pvp and  small gang in this awesome ally. 
---
Now I started fcing. You have no pressure there. 
---
No mandatory things. Fleets fits etc. 
---
Only thing have fun and don't be an asshole
---
That's all
---
Alot of old very good pilots are still in rvb and yOu can learn as much as you want from them.
---
That must be a longer time a go? 
---
Technically, it's still "RMT" (even though it doesn't involve realworld money) because it violates the eve terms of service.
---
&gt;You may not market, sell, advertise, promote, solicit or otherwise arrange for the exchange or transfer of items in the game or other game services unless it is for in-game sales of in-game services or items.
---
Condor fleet on the bl dude
---
Ahhhhhhhhhh make sense :D thanks
---
Just like every event they've ever had where they had a prize, they just randomly pair people off and expect a good fight. I remember last fanfest I had to fly with a a couple of dudes and one of them was a guy sole job in eve had been high sec hauling. I literally had to explain to him 5 minutes before the fight started how to fly a vexor. We managed to get through one round, but got roundly smashed right after that. ggwp CCP, thanks for zero fun.
---
cause he can make ad revenue.   
---
tbh, idk
---
Eve is a sandbox.  
---
Dude, as a past corpmate I can tell you.. do it!
---
Every Eve event I have been to has been a blast. 
---
Not just reminiscing with friends and enemies about those good fights, but also meeting players outside your circle of play.
---
Every game sub tbh
---
What did he say?
---
Mid-2011 and incarna?
---
You know it changed a few months ago?
---
Great quote.
---
And to OP, it will get better. 
---
Why should the attacker be stalled if nobody is willing to defend a citadel?
---
jesus fucking christ
---
They're not randomly pairing people off. Unless you can't find someone to pair with.
---
Go take a look at the blog.
---
:thonking: I mean it was a nice 100 hacs (you and BL) vs. my 45. I put on my big boy pants and took the fight since if I didn't I'd spend an hour warping around Kamela being chased by you and Elo. after losing 30/45 Muninns I decided that was enough and went home.
---
Making the enemy defend the structure is what caused many fights in the first place.
---
It's not really bait. I was with inPanic from the beginning right until the end.
---
I just never updated it.
---
god bless you
---
Only thing you can accomplish is giving credibility to the other ideas by posting this shit here.
---
Supercaps should be immune to remote reps, putting them on par with in-combat dreads and triage
---
Nhhe... The novelty of that animation wears off too quickly! &gt;.&gt;
---
He could have googled it and had his answer, and then someone else would have asked. It's okay to ask easy questions, we are socializing :)
---
Delete fax, allow caps to rep each other (reduced amount compared to what we had in the past  though). Bring back combat refitting - it was a lot of fun.
---
&gt;scram and web
---
&gt;punisher
---
lmbo
---
Yeah. Wouldn't it be glorious? How successfully can an astra be defended from 250 titans today?
---
Sounds like you had a great fight and learned a lot! One thing I've learned to do is to keep a tiny separate window with just my boosters, pinned in a corner. It takes up a little bit of screen space, but ensures that you won't forget to use it. It almost looks like a mod on your ship!
---
I know what they do. Which is exactly why I said what I said. 
---
It all makes sense now, Olmeca and Mar5hy aren't doesn't have an obsession bordering on mental illness with goons, all their work is to prevent the Palatine Keepstar, they foresaw the decadence and corruption this would bring upon the game. Heroes mocked and punished for trying to save us all.
---
I can totally get behind this
---
this is so pathetic its not even funny
---
2nd favourite suggestion after removing damage cap, and better than removing damage cap for unfueled structures.
---
Just because I noticed some sidetracking here and I kinda wanted to get my idea straight :  
---
The process would be like   
---
1. You get close to your friendly Nyx 
---
2. It is out of combat so it has the possibility to dock you 
---
3. You dock up - you see what looks like the interior of a station, you can spin your ship 
---
4. Options are undock/look outside like in a citadel. You can also set your respawn clone here which you do.
---
5. Your Nidhoggur jumps at a cyno - undock and look outside are disabled for the jump duration
---
6. The nid lands in the middle of a battle 
---
7. You "look outside" and see it might be good to undock now 
---
8. You click Undock and you get out in your ship and all 
---
9. if you and the nid don't have pvp timers you can dock again
---
10. If you get killed you will respawn in the Nyx 
---
You are in teh Nyx and it gets killed - you get popped outside in your current ship 
---
You are in the Nyx and it goes offline - you get popped outside in your current ship 
---
You are in the Nyx and log off - you get popped outside in your current ship and follow regular logoff procedure afterwards
---
Dominion after space aids was miles better. There was a universe wide blue doughnut in 2014.
---
Supers aren't the problem, panic module is.
---
I do think so, but not as many as now.
---
Structures shouldn't have tethering at all and never should have. That was a first step to Risk Aversion: Online
---
That might be exactly why it's done. 
---
* Player wants to make sure no one can impersonate them.
---
* Player never biomasses their character.
---
* Player can always return to the game and become a paying customer again.
---
Structures can't be DD'd.
---
To be clear, they fired literally nobody last year who helped EVE_NT
---
Aren't they really slow and difficult compared to other 6/10s?
---
O fuck me too.  Tbh good year
---
Agreed. Right about when Bombers bar was not the thing it is today and RvB ganked was hot fire still.
---
Spectre was just formed around then from what I remember too.
---
And what if the specific group CCP picks doesn‚Äôt include you? what if they, for example, decided the group they should please at the exclusion of ever one else was high sec Care Bears?
---
re: EFT, just use Pyfa for ship fitting, it also has a way to add abyssal mods (you can individually modify values) to verify that certain fits work.  Abyssal boosters/ AB / damage modules are on contract and can get really expensive, however, if you need less cpu (mostly) to make item fit, then they can be a pretty nice option and even cheaper than the original module was to purchase.
---
Well I actually enjoy being hunted. ;)
---
When I want pvp, I do low sec and get in a combat ship

We've done this once before, no plans to do it again at this stage.

&gt; Have you considered suicide?

Or some fucked up shit like that.
---
So we upvote /u/CCP_Falcon to make this top comment. 
---
I usually upvote him on principle, since he knows what‚Äôs actually happening more than we do. 
---
This is it, boys
---
Most supers will carry their nestor for a quick refit and a blockade runner for the quick access to a fleet hanger for 3200 and what ever else. Other ships are in hanger are fight specific called by fc.
---
because shit this retarded is often that
---
'find your wingman' is very different to flying with the dudes you know, fly with, and fight with day in, day out, against other people who have and do fly together in an alliance. To pretend this is anything like a competitive match is laughable
---
lol scrub, Delve and the possibilities of PvE Multiboxing ARE the reason atm for economy going to shit. And the thing I laugh about most is that Delve inhabitants are the ones crying loudest about it, Ore too cheap, PLEX to expansive, and always these damn guys who did not realize that this is FarmVille now and PvP is condemned ...
---
AOE DD's hit them just fine.
---
Three years here, and the charm hasn't worn off in the least.
---
Why don‚Äôt people use capital ships as busses with jump clones now?
---
Agreed, there is some truth to the conclusion that Snuff are actually pretty shit at anything other than Titan blobbing or bending the knee, open mouth to goons.
---
Last week's fight on a blue Tatara, saw Snuff drop 25 titans on a LS Voltron sub cap fleet that was already out numbered by Snuff's own sub-cap fleet.
---
https://br.inyour.space/?s=2066&amp;b=8491680&amp;e=150&amp;t=qffG
---
There are definitely regions that arent as titan focused. depending on the timezone, there will be 100 man fleet fights where i live (provi-bloc). we sometimes get blopped by more people/bigger stuff. As Providence is close to empire space there are many roamers around and often there is a police fleet trying to catch them.
---
In the grand scale of things i would say titan alliances are the dominating factors of eve.
---
So back on CSM when all this Citadel stuff was getting sorted out, there was a lot of talk about how powerful these new structures should be. The overall agreement was "We need people to actively want to leave POSes and outposts and even stations behind if we're going to fulfill all the promises we've made about our long-term space future." So it made sense that you release structures that are probably a little too powerful. 
---
If you undershot and nobody ever anchored or used them, the whole thing was a wash. You could always tone them down later AFTER they'd been widely adopted and there was no longer an alternative.
---
Well, that point is now. Outposts are gone, POSes are deprecated and soon to be retired. Now we can afford to do things like remove tethering on low power structures, re-assess damage caps, etc.
---
thank you, i am the top of something
---
&gt;My question is, are there any corps or alliances that are not involved into the big mess between the titans and that are far away from them?
---
I mean most wormhole groups will generally be away from them. 
---
&gt; What I picture in my mind is a medium sized alliance at war with another medium sized alliance, little skirmishes every now and then, group fights and not a whole zerg of 100s and 1000s of people.
---
‚ÄãSounds like wormhole space, keep in mind Wormhole space includes a lot of fight for fun, so not all fights are really everything on the line where bored and rolled into you is often good enough of a reason for like medium size ( 10 to 50 dudes ) engagements. 
---
&gt;When I first joined my current corp, I thought I will learn a lot, I will be safe and that I will be able to make a lot of isk due to the amount of territory owned by the alliance, but I feel like I was wrong, also there is so many newbies like myself that I feel like at this point most are not bothered to deal with us anymore.
---
Did i talk about wormhole space already ? 
---
Like often corps are smaller it also means there more depended on pilots, like don't get me wrong your always gonna tell people you need help because nobody is a mind reader.
---
But often when groups take in newbro's they will do some degree of education given there often lots of disconnected groups like there is no universal policy and you may have to ask groups a bit to find your fit. 
---
&gt; I'm not sure if other people were in the same situation when they first started, but I'm having a hard time finding myself a home, I made a post not so long ago asking for recommendations but this is what came up out of that.
---
Like going into more small gangs isn't a bad idea, it's gonna be more personal, the smaller the closure the group often is or there just bad it's often hard to tell that's why advice on particular small groups is hard. 
---
General rules: 
---
If you not having fun leave nobody is gonna expect you to sit there being frustrated. 
---
If you're told to buy plex to buy injectors or otherwise forced to do actions that cost RL money FUCKING RUN, there is nothing wrong with doing it but there is something wrong with leadership forcing it. 
---
Try to account for how the corp is run and what the offer you, because there are small groups out there that will exploit you for grinding and don't care try to identify those.
---
CCP had been promising a "walking in stations" expansion for years by that point, and in fact had demo'd a playable version at Fanfest 2009. This had been severely delayed from then on, until finally it rolled out in the Summer 2011 expansion, "Incarna". Incarna was, to put it lightly, a disaster:
---
- Players were thus rather upset to discover that instead of the fully-fledged, fully-customizable station interiors we had been promised, we instead got a tiny, totally un-customizable "captain's quarters" hotel room (and the somewhat dingy, rusty Minmatar version at that).
---
- The launch version of Incarna was also hilariously unoptimized, heating peoples' graphics cards up to dangerous points.
---
- Customizable character clothes/accessories also launched. For "micro" transactions, they were horribly overpriced - virtual jeans cost ~$20, and the prized virtual monocle $60!
---
- At the same time, an article was leaked from CCP's internal magazine discussing how gameplay-modifying microtransactions ("pay to win") would be a positive thing to add to the game. It later turned out the article was taken out of context - it was an argument for the sake of argument, and a corresponding anti-P2W article had also run. But the damage was already done.
---
- To top it all off, the first response to player outrage from CCP was basically "We're sorry that you're upset, but not for what we did."
---
It was a perfect storm of failed promises, bad pricing choices, and leaks. The result was a real riot - people assembled in Jita and other market hubs to bombard indestructable objects as a form of protest. Honestly, it was the first time we really felt like CCP had breached our trust as a playerbase.
---
How do capital ships cary other ships currently?
---
The price of getting old. Shit happens. 
---
I could easily say "2019 is better - got a wife, got a kid, law degree, new dog coming, wife beat cancer, etc."
---
But looking at the past, everything is rosier. 
---
This would have pissed off a LOT of people. Tethering was a concession to both POS owners and/or capital pilots who wanted POS shield functionality.
---
That said I'm 100% behind weaker/limited tethering.
---
This is the goon rmt streamer that was called out last week. Good to see his twitch is suspended although the known rmt'er has yet to be removed from goons.
---
The one issue with that is anchoring keepstars/forts are low power. I really don't have an issue with expensive assets being difficult to kill. It's the little cheap ones that I find stupid.
---
I'm sure it was just one of my wormholer friends being friendly. 
---
Summer of Rage v1.0 
---
i like this
---
Before jump fatigue? I remember playing Dust and hearing everyone complain about how someone couldn‚Äôt take two steps outside and not be jumped on by capitals from across the game. It was horrible for players who were not part of the super coalitions.
---
so salty
---
This is the third post you've made about your current situation. Drop the corp, pick up elsewhere. Check out /r/evejobs but be wary of vulture corps in NS that promise you everything.
---
As already stated, you might wanna give wormholes a go. Check out some low-class corps that live in C4s (and fight other wormholers) or C2s (that generally roam in small gangs of 3-8 pilots and fight in their nullsec).
---
If you're not sure about wormhole space, check out EVE University's Wormhole Campus.
---
I just wanted to point out that this a great example of friendship friday.  First we kill Did he say Jump dudes, then they help us kill an Aeon.  I was a bit misty eyed.
---
That would have been cool, but it's way too late to implement now given the current cap meta (and probably wasn't ever *really* feasible).
---
You think structure spam is bad now?  Just wait until structures have a hard limit on docked caps and you have to drop twenty of them in order to forward-deploy an entire cap fleet.
---
It made sense in the context of CCP's original vision in which a large alliance had a *few* supercaps, but it the only thing it would accomplish now is increasing citadel spam while producing a pile of un-fun, un-engaging busywork for everyone involved.
---
this is definitely not competitive, but don't pretend it's random - you can pick your partner all you want if you can both go to an event
---
I take it you weren't around for POSes?
---
Or did you just forget that experience?
---
If we want to go off historic structure hp:isk ratios, they need to at least triple medium structure ehp.
---
So your solution to an in game issue of something undefended taking too long to kill....is to not play the game? You don't see the problem there? I was killing an anchoring Raitru the other night, and literally went and made a steak. That's not good gameplay. 
---
On your other note about the "Little guy", it's a fallacy. If ANY of the major alliances want a structure dead, it's dead. With the current mechanics you just feed loss mails until it dies. Making it "annoying" isn't a good solution.
---
Yes this was the goon RMT streamer called out last week
---
First post was asking for advice on which Corp to look into, this one I‚Äôm basically asking if everything revolves around the big alliances, I was curious if small corps can do their own thing and stay out of the way of the Titans without getting bullied if you get what I‚Äôm trying to say..
---
The biggest reason for poses honestly even for bigger groups is the quick anchor, like 24h is often way to long to wait on your FOB and a pos + orca has like 80% of the functionality. 
---
This is exactly why the damage caps exist.
---
The idea is not to let the astra win the fight against 250 titans.
---
Its to make it so 250 titans don't just smash every structure one mid away for shits and giggles, preventing any real method for a small group to fight them.
---
The painful grind *is* the defense, as it is for most anti-blob mechanics.
---
I really appreciate your comment, very informative. I‚Äôll look into wormhole corps. I was thinking about it but I thought I‚Äôd be better off to leave it for later on when I get better at the game. 
---
Also about the Corp leadership exploiting their members, that was my very first Corp experience. Thankfully one of the main guys exposed the leader so I managed to get out in time.
---
&gt; Not disputing your conclusion, just elaborating.
---
That's what i led my reply with.      
---
It was not even directed at you, just in context to your reply so someone who does *not* know might find it.
---
Why should the defender be handicapped by being forced to bring extra logi just for the structure?
---
See you think that is the case, however it really isn't. Big groups hate structure bashes. Unless it results in a large fight, it's really boring content. The only reason we would bother to kill your little low sec astrahaus or whatever is if it's being used by our enemies to tether on or something. Provided your structure is high power, and has guns on it, that prevents any small group from taking it on. I would even be in favor of buffing the weapons on structures to make them more difficult to destroy when actively gunned. 
---
I see, so basically unless you‚Äôre a wormholer you can‚Äôt really avoid getting ‚Äúblopped‚Äù is that right? 
---
Or I guess highsec too but that‚Äôs no fun.
---
Sure,  
---
But a much more effective way of restricting structures per system could be done through limits on how much is anchorable in a system. While tedious, the old POS system gave this limitation by restricting the amount of structures to the amount of moons.
---
What if the server side needs those mass disconnects
---
I don't think anyone has a clue wtf you were trying to say
---
I'll have to experiment. I use the low slot missile guidance. My mids are for tank and ab. I find using javelins work well. What drones do you use?
---
[deleted]
---
Eh i think Tethering has a bad rep as it was introduced at the time where eve just felt getting like it was getting safer and safer.
---
I understand the concession but it's actually not. It was when they thought about the locking of ships which hasn't happened.
---
Super / Titan pilots still need stay in their ships even when tether so quite frankly it's a pointless safety mechanic for people who forget to dock (Yes i know you can bump them off).
---
You realize thats a Reddit meme and I'm literally the sexiest man in Eve?
---
Pretty sure a bunch of clients popping in and out over and over doesnt help. Not that there arent already a fuckload of socket closures and other problems. At least this will highlight the server side issues and not be bottlenecked by the client anymore.
---
Gotcha. Sorry.  I use mids on the Cerb for my tank and AB. No room for for much more. I tried web and painters. But the tank suffered. 
---
Please excuse me while i suicide dreads/ABCs/dessies or run boosh doctrines to kill your keepstar without any intent to engage defenders,  then drop my own keepstar in a random ADM 6 system of yours to deny your supercapital fleet docking facilities for a week.  
---
Rinse repeat for other structures in each system, making sure to put final timers at a weekday AUTZ to maximize your grind to regain use of your own space.
---
Or as defender, put enough raitarus in every system to prevent hostile beachheads from ever forming.
---
Structure caps WILL be abused to the maximum extent possible.
---
TBQFH - the more localisation CCP brings to EVE the better are the chances of attracting new players and having a hope of retaining them.
---
Use that PA money for improved outreach.
---
I think that's just the "Cold Ice Skin" CCP is working on
---
That is easily changeable.
---
How has that worked out so far?
---
why did they not just farm out the at to Eve nt? 
---
my plaque would probably be a stiletto not tackling shit.
---
you still have access to your server where you run the tournaments then?
---
If a defender is interested in defending a structure they are almost always guaranteed to have logi with them. Alternatively you can maintain a shield regen, just like POS have, or the insta-heal ability of citadels today.
---
However, the point is to force people to not simply spam out citadels they do not intend to defend, and to punish them for choosing not to defend them.
---
didn't they also want service modules to show on the city model
---
wormholers often go roam in NS and get blopped.
---
But they go there via unsuspected ways, they can take some kills and moon walk before the capitals arrived 
---
no SwordlessBunny, though.
---
Its the only reason the structures have a chance of living, just as it was for POSes.  The reason large groups do not exterminate anyone smaller than them in range is the pain.
---
For reference, with 240 titans, you could now kill 960 astras in 3 1 hour sessions, with less than 8 minutes vulnerable on grid in each session.  
---
It becomes laughably easy to just burn everything within a couple mids.
---
thanks for making such good joke to cheer me up today (‚úø‚ó†‚Äø‚ó†)
---
Rip the guy who didn't have enough fuel and the one who tried to help him. Also, is two a handful? 
---
Eve uni WH Campus are realy good guys.
---
In my experience, they nerver not take the bait.
---
Often fly in some cheap and low skill T1 doctrines.
---
I mean, why not let them be DD'd? Personally I would like to see the single target DD revert to being usable on everything a gun can be used on. 
---
Lmao I was wondering why 400 people were watching some guy mine in highsec :thinking:
---
Hi , low or null? Is there a an ongoing war? Is concord involved?
---
incorrect
---
yep
---
&gt;I'm sure your an ok guy but don't talk shit when you have absolutely nothing to back it up with.
---
Bahahahahahhaahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahaha....\*deep breath\* Bahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahhahhahahahahahahahahahhahaha
---
Structures that need it most? These structures are cheap as dirt, there is no reason they should be so strong. You should get way you pay for. If these structures are easily spammable and so cheap they should be very easy to remove as well. Damage cap on fighter squadrons also needs to removed 
---
We weren't part of a supercoalition vOv. In fact we lived behind hostile lines, and in Venal.
---
Force projection was definitely a thing (people literally showed up from across the map for Asakai) but fights were a lot more regional and organic; the nature of moon mining meant you had to spread your holdings thinner, rather than ultra-concentrate in a couple of regions.
---

nope nope nope (unless it's got a hard/log cap at like 5-10 fax worth)

Spidertanked RR carriers were turboaids in the old days, they made big superfleets invincible except against bigger superfleets
---
Mass fax reps are turboaids today, they make big titanfleets invincible except against DD volleys from bigger titanfleets
---
Supercaps have always been super imba because they can't be beat except by having more of the same thing, which is why all the main powerblocs have holed up in a galactic corner rorqmining like crazy to try and outbuild each other. Until we make supers/titans vulnerable to something else (preferably dread fleets) they're gonna keep megafucking the entire sovnull meta.

thats not awkward at all...
---
Fairly well since theres lots of structures on the periphery of most big groups' space and there's a post complaining about damage caps at least once each month.
---
I mean shit, my corp has 6 titans, it will cost about 60 mill to DD astras (40 mill for raitarus), and we could kill 8 astras per hour or 12 raitarus (average of 3 hours for all timers), so even if theyre unfitted we'd look at about 2.4 bill of salvage in an hour, so about 210 mill/hour/person earnings to kill them while also shutting down droppers and roamers.  We'd keep everything within a mid or two empty, since thats in the vicinity of ratting income with the occasional fitting drop, and far less boring.

I remember a chronicle that briefly mentioned a skillbook and what it is. Like, it's a program that's downloaded and over time it rewires your brain to be better at controlling different aspects of the ship, or something like that.

Love Fanfest. I went to an Iceland one and, not just the EVE folks, but everybody in Iceland was awesome. Love that it's in my hometown this time and I will certainly be going. Indeed, I would go to every single one of them if I could.
---
Highlights are, EVERYBODY wants to talk about EVE!!! Hearing insights from people about how to play different aspects of the game. Uber swag. Year's quota of sunlight traveling to the event. Apparently these people have actual lives and can be great connections.
---
So, to each their own, but I certainly enjoy them. :)

I‚Äôm not sure, but you can do /copyskills in any chat window to copy over your skills from the normal server.

how could you go from cat to dog though???

Yeah, resource wars overall was badly implemented imo and (wasn't/ isn't) worth the time and effort
---
No titans or supers in Wormhole space :) There's a couple groups that accept newer pilots (my alliance, Wormhole Society being one of them) you might want to check them out.
---
Be aware though, theres very little if any afk friendly playstyles in jspace. You need to actually be playing the game, in comms, using your dscan etc. Sure its great to go solo, scan the chain, run all the relic/data sites you can find, make a couple bil a week and come back, but most of the time its.playing as a group, finding people to fight, scanning a ton, keeping eyes out for targets etc. Its a blast and i love it, but its very much make your own content, not having it spoonfed to you like in null.

---
Sure you can, if you're willing to think outside of the box.  
---
An example of that would be that for every structure over the threshold, their upkeep increases dramatically. 
---
Another example would be to set a system wide maximum defined by size and by celestials. Not a 1:1 conversion, mind you. But say you have 10 moons, 3 planets. You'd be limited to X structures based on whatever metric you use as baseline. Something like ADM ratings but differently.  
---
I am just writing this quickly from the shitter, imagine if you'd spend time to come with an actual proposal which is thought out. There are ways that could benefit all.

After the tractor beam pulls the moon chunk from the moon, the athanor structure will blow it in small pieces, so a mining fleet can park in and start mining

That math doesn't hold for so many reasons. Have you ever gated 240 titans? I promise you 10 will bounce off and need protecting. That's also 1200 warps, which take about 2 minutes each. Jump Fatigue, etc. Not to mention if you put 240 titans on grid, anywhere in eve, people will come for them. 
---
Now you're going to say "Well you could just split the titans up!". You will lose trillions in titan losses. Not to mention an astra with anti-capital guns on it is actually able to fight off a single titan.
---
Now you got your answer :D
---
The first one is the past, the second is the future.
---
Isn't the reason structure bashing boring is because of the damage cap?
---
Anyways, something being boring doesn't mean that people wont do it for schadenfreude. See many gate camps for good examples.
---
Nvidia doesn't have a proprietary solution. Their hardware is accessible through DXR or Vulkan ray tracing API.
---
Hey fuck you buddy
---
They hate structure bashes BECAUSE of the damage cap though mainly, right? If you could throw a ball of 200 guys in DPS ships at an Astra and have it reinforced in a few minutes, I think we'd see a lot more toppling of sandcastles, in my opinion.
---
An astra with anti-capital guns cannot tackle a titan.  That's 3 titans firing lances to reinforce each astra in 10 second spool up + 15 seconds damage (astras won't even dent a titan in that time-frame), then a using the remainder of the 4 minute CD to cap up and travel to the next target.  Combat-fit titans with cynos would have plenty of access to FAX reinforcements (especially since you would do this to clear out small, meaningless groups, not forces capable of matching your escalation), and you can even keep them anti-tackle fit since your damage to the astras is from DDs, not guns.  To be fair, that would mean keeping 240 FAX alts on standby, and probably a dozen ceptors for warp-ins, but point stands that it actually earns a halfway decent income while securing your space to a degree that is painful to do today.
---
If you honestly believe groups won't do that, then more power to you, but I already have volunteers from my alliance to join me if CCP ever makes that change.  I will concede that risk-averse nullbears with hangar trophy titans will probably decline to participate, so 240 titans is unlikely to materialize short of a group making a CTA out of it.
---
Found the cure newbie 
---
Nah, having it be literally impossible to prevent a blob volleying your structure is not fun.
---
What they shouldn't have is probably two reinforce timers. Or 2 day timers everywhere.
---
Yeh, I guess roach motel kinda insinuates that it would be unfitted but I actually mean fitted astras - which cost about 1.3bil ish defending on how u fit them - about the same cost as a fleet fitted leshak

Buffing is irrelevant to big groups. 100 people roll up, 1 shot the astrahaus and move on to the next structure.

You aren't buffing gun strength enough to deal with that.

I went to EVE Vegas a few years ago and had a blast.  But I also made sure that I saw other things in Vegas, took roadtrip etc.  There is such a thing as "too much EVE Nerds".  
---
If you going to Toronto, reserve time to visit this really awesome town.  Lots to see and do that is not related to spaceships... 
---
looking at it, at least converting from Polish, British, and Euro to USD.
---
they've all decreased in value vs the US Dollar.
---
including the Iceland Krona.
---
so steam is probably just trying to stay on the USD for now as its actually gaining value rather than lowering.(and USD is Steam's base currency)
---
they'll probably adjust it eventually to match the new currency equivalents....eventually.
---
this is what happens when theres a 12 to 20% decrease in currency value vs anothers.
---
Very cool!

Hope life is treating you fair and I will keep my eyes open for you in Vegas.

Yes, that is why I use non-Steam clients and pay Steam to PLEX my accounts :D
---
POSs have lots of advantages. Upwell structures don't really replace POSs, they replace player deployed stations.
---
With a POS:
---
- Anchor time is near-instant
---
- They are cheap
---
- They defend themselves against AFK oracles
---
- But, if you bring a real force to one, you can remove it in a reasonable time
---
- They aren't infinitely spammable (one per moon limit) and you can't play silly grid games with them

It's highly unlikely he was banned for viewbotting, as close to zero streamers total have actually been shown to actually have been banned because of viewbotting- it was much more likely he broke the rule in twitch that states "You're not allowed to break the Terms of Service of any game you're playing" which he clearly did in eve.

I'd argue the best years in EVE were before everyone had a capital.

I strongly feel that "the EVE Brand Experience" is not just the look and feel of EVE alone, but the **WHAT YOU DO MATTERS BECAUSE SINGLE SHARD** aspect.
---
By creating a separate mobile experience,  it dilutes the EVE brand. People WILL be confused by the separate platforms.
---
Dust 514 was the best idea ever. Orbital bombardment from space from the other game!?! SWEET! .... aaaaand they killed it by making it a PS3 exclusive &gt;\_&lt;
---
Then along came Gunjack and Valkyrie which occurred in their own universes, instead of Gunjack being "control a turret on a ship in TQ" or Valkyrie being actually flying a fighter launched out of an EVE player's actual carrier. 
---
Yes, I realize that's insane, but that would have fit EVE better. Imagine if Valkyrie players were basically "smart drones" launched out of your ships?
---
Godspeed.
---
Why can't they just let the value of caps continue to drop? Instead of going back, just introduce some kind of mega titan and do some work to ensure scarcity.
---
Eh, I think it could sort of work if applied to smaller structures.
---
Keep letting supercaps dock in keepstars, let 2-3 supers 'moor' to a fort, and let 2-3 regular caps moor to an astra. But if the structure is destroyed, moored ships would break free and anyone could hop in them and take them. 
---
Would give smaller groups that don't have the resources to defend a keepstars or forts a way to safely store capital assets.
---
That the game has changed alot and for the better in most areas. And 90% of the bitching on Reddit is just people dick riding others cause they are afraid to just enjoy the game that's in front of them.
---
Even if the do, like its 500 mill down you dump 10 billion in wardecs on top of it and it's likely totally a trivial cost ( and with 100 mill decs it might end up being cheaper then it is right now ). 
---
To save the killboard you put it in a structure holding corp, that you move out after day 7 and repeat the process, you need to cycle corps a bit but meh alpha's are free.
---
&gt; Rest assured, CCP is committed to carrying on the tradition of yearly  Alliance contests in the future that many players get to love.  
---
So not having an AT is their way of showing commitment? Drunken 2v2 single elimination format ftw!
---
Great idea. Instead of working towards fixing the problem, let's double down on stupidity and introduce more capitals.
---
But it's ok because these ones are larger and "harder to get."
---
Ion please beat this man like the red headed step child he is

---
blue because you can do something with it, grey because you can't. I assume.

Which is precisely why cats are the appropriate pet for an EvE player. HTFU

Thanks for the idea I‚Äôll look into it, that‚Äôs something I had in mind :)
---
UK prices are uk prices, not the USD price, converted.
---
Euro is probably the same.
---
Other prices are probably converted at some point.
---
And this will, most likely, be steam rather than CCP.
---
You could join a larger group that attracts predators and thus content. It‚Äôs what I did. I play three or four nights a week after the family has gone to bed and I am greatly enjoying a lot of chaotic small gang home defence stuff.
---
Because flying those ships takes a pilot and there's no situation in a capital fight where a subcap is more useful than another capital. The people who'd be pulling those ships for a subcap fight will just be in another carrier (or FAX).
---
It's another manifestation of the 'caps are too good at everything' problem.
---
I live in Argentina mate, and our currency is constantly droping in comparison to u$d; it's not the game that's getting more expensive, is our own coin that loses value compared to it.
---
Dogs are simpler in every way. Both animals have their merits; dogs are far higher maintenance but can be trained. Cats let you do what you want but if you put effort into the lovins, they'll put that much effort in as well. I look at it as a "servant" vs "companion"

There are many advantages to small and medium corps/alliances, but you need to make sure the content and activity are there. Don‚Äôt talk yourself out of trying to join an active Corp because you think you ‚Äòaren‚Äôt experienced enough‚Äô or ‚Äòwanna learn in a shit group‚Äô because you never will, and you‚Äôll not find the game fun. In my experience almost any group is just looking for more dudes to interact with and play the game. 
---
I‚Äôm biased towards unspoken bc that‚Äôs who I fly with these days. 
---
If you are in our timezone DM me, or join our in game public channel.
---
I mean, I feel like it's well past the point of no return already. Wasn't the original point of capitals was to have a large, expensive weapon at the disposal of large entities? If they're no longer large and expensive, meaning that the only way to project force is to just have a bajillion of them, then why wouldn't introducing a larger, more expensive weapon work? As long as there are controls in place to keep the situation from going the way of the titans again, I would think things would work out.
---
You are probably 100% correct, but that problem could be fixed by the right kind of balance patch.

If you run Darks (the Sacrilege is one of the few ships that can reliably run the Dark sites which have much cheaper filament costs) you'll want the double webs.  Otherwise, the web+tp will help you apply better for ships within webrange. 
---
You'll also probably want to move over to Heavy Assault Missiles, as the DPS increase is higher not only on paper but also in practice - the ship can run L4s with ease, and L5s with a bit of practice (and pimping out the gear helps, too).  The range is significantly shorter, but in Dark sites your ship is quite nimble and able to get into range quite easily.
---
"then why wouldn't introducing a larger, more expensive weapon work?"
---
The problem with this is endless escalation. All thats going to happen here is the supposed "hard to get" ships will become easier to get and the cycle of stupidity (not you, CCP) continues. We will then have 50 people on the field with super titans than can kill 10 titans, 40 supers and 100 capitals every 10 mins.
---
The retarded part about this is CCP will put this forward as "balance" and the idiots among the player-base will eat this shit up and suppress anyone with a dissenting opinion.

I agree, but it‚Äôs only if you biomass the character that the name becomes available again. That was always the case. If you just let the character go inactive, the name is yours pretty much forever. (It‚Äôs unlikely CCP will release these names as  a) define inactive period,  and b) people come back to the game after years and you‚Äôd lose these players.
---
1% doesn't mean you'll make 1% less though, some items, especially some of the quickest moving stuff like plex, has a profit margin of only a few percent or even less than a percent. While Omega traders can make a profit on these (and it's compensated for by how quickly the trades move) you'll make significantly less or not even be profitable. ie if the profit margin is 2%, you making 1% less on the total means your profit is halved

Because then Goons, Snuffed or whomever can field a boatload of titans can just go to a structure, instantly reinforce it, and do it on another structure in 5 minutes, and repeat as often as they need. If you can't field enough titans or batphone enough coalitions who can, all you can do is form a sacrificial fleet and hope that a good feed will satisfy the attacker.

Being 64 bit from the get-go and migrating a 15 year old game full of spaghetti code are two VERY different things.  I have been through quite a few games that have migrated from 32 bit to 64 bit, and basically all of them will release the clients side-by-side until bugs are worked out.  In almost every case, there have been major bugs for a substantial portion of the playerbases where the fix was "use the 32 bit client until its fixed".  
---
CCP is demonstrably terrible at rolling our new software bug-free, so not having a fallback could potentially cause some people to not be able to play at all for weeks (months(years?)).
---
Had a friend lose his carrier with a Widow in the hangar, that he had forgotten about.
---
It isn't uncommon to have a spare HIC, DIC, or cyno ship in the hangar, and industrials with many piles of cap charges or strontium (so that some drops in the wreck).
---
Thanks for the feedbacks guys, i appreciate it, i am gonna give it a try...
---
It provides for the possibility of a defense fleet and the possibility for the defense fleet to do some good. Without that you'll just get 200 people show up, ignore the defender, kill the struct and then decide whether to extract or kill the defenders.
---
Back then supercaps were immune to ewar. Today they are not. I think deleting fax and returning to pre-2015 supercaps eve with ewar vulnerability would be vastly different to what it was like at the time.
---
One day I pay 33 PLN for Omega time month, which was about 5 days ago, and yesterday I learned I would pay like 56 PLN. According to my calculations that's about 72%.
---
yeah, that's the way to handle this. fuck you 
---
Also, I paid CCP 100 PLN to move my character to Steam just to pay less for my Omega time (and start paying, too). So far I've been buying my PLEX for ISK. Now I'm considering dropping EVE altogether if they don't fix that pricebug.
---
Reminds me of:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_73I5RuJCAk

Wow, is that the way you talk about former "Valued allies"? Naughty naughty :).

I was a fetus in 2007

" Once set, it will be possible to log into the account using the new  account name and password within the game launcher as well, should a log  in through STEAM not be possible for any reason. "
---
I've already voted with my wallet and unsubbed my accounts due to citadels and panic module. 
---
Because they have a weird hardon for monochrome.  It's terrible, but seems to be their unwavering vision on all things EVE.  I expect the entire game to be greyscale at some point.
---
Okay, then how are they superior at plotting to kill their owner?
---
CHECKMATE DOGGO LOVER
---
He was in Rate my ticks before goons.
---
D:
---
I mean whatever floats your boat I guess but why are you here then? Go, be free. Don‚Äôt dwell here in misery with those of us still chained to the stone.
---
It's also great to have rules 48h before so you don't have to deal with practicing, you know have all these fair and interesting fights on schedule for weeks/months in advance... Definitely worthless game content compared to awesome high sec propless spec tanked ferox f1 brawls.
---
Too many "Janusz" people onioned their way to steam to pay CCP less.
---
Thanks for the setup, you say lvl 4, you mean standard lvl 4 missions or abyss lvl 4s? 
---
Someone is lifebotting when he pays for a service that brings lifes to his channel that aren't actual humans.
---
This isn't accurate anymore, you've been able to set an account name and password for steam accounts for a while now.
---
Showing support for a bro, and wishing the game would return to a state where I could play it again.
---
yeah i'd submit a ticket on CCP's site so they can tell steam to fix their shit.
---
CCP's customer service is usually pretty good about fixing that fast
---
I live 30 mins outside of Toronto, and have lived in the city since birth pretty much, not much I haven't seen here. 
---
I am an electric in the local film union, I can light the place up, but don't know how to work a camera.
---
lol so true
---
Cheaper
---
Fair enough on supporting friends but there‚Äôs some rose tinted lenses if you really want to go backwards.
---
Question is a little vague, but with smaller corps and alliances I know everyone in our fleets, I know what everyone can fly, how well they can fill the role. We can form up fairly quick, don‚Äôt have to explain multiple times how to buy ships on contracts etc. guys are excited to get meaningful content, actually fly their ships. 
---
So yes, your synopsis is fairly accurate. :-)
---
FFS are you actually the new Falcon? Imagine not even get paid to spin that firing Logibro doesn't count because it was more than 365 days ago. 
---
Except dogs are way more companion like lmao. The hell are you talking about?
---
I can't tell are you yelling at jay, gay for jay hoping he turns around to leave, or yelling at a cloud, old man?
---
Sweet Corvus, thanks for the info Ringo or any Bloc guys going? 
---
I doubt people bothered figuring out fits to solo it at high tier
---
Would have been better if you'd been using a 64-bit graphics package.
---
I mean, kinda sounds like he doesn't actually play the game sooo
---
honestly, the halloween war was the best experience I ever had in the game.
---
Kor-Azor Low Sec s just another name for Southern Khanid
---
true story
---
It's strange - when you look at Eve today with all of the QoL features, activities and quite amazing visuals, we should be over the moon and playercount should be at an all time high
---
I see a companion as someone/something that I don't have to worry about or can do things on their own but they'll come hang out or bug me for attention and leave me alone when I want to be left alone. Dogs...dogs are always there ready for you to do \*anything\* in my experience. I know you can train them out of their separation anxiety, but idk. Just not my style.
---
To each their own, in the end. I dig cats more than dogs, but i definitely love dogs too.
---
I would tell you, best way to learn is to mess up and learn from it. 
---
There for honestly you not gonna get wormhole experience without living there so you might as well live there. ( i'm not gonna direct you to any corp because honestly i would advice you to talk to HR of as many as you can ask loads of questions and see what answers you like the best ). 
---
In general, if your fit doesn't fit and you wonder if it's because of skills, just paste it into pyfa with all skills set to 5. You can then manually adjust skills to see how far you need to train if that is the case.
---
Also remember that CPU/PG implants are a thing, and the 1-3% are relatively cheap (and besides it is hard toget podded in low sec if you know what you're doing)
---
Amen!

Here is part 5: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjpgEDTfx2w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjpgEDTfx2w)
---
Doubtful, as we mostly US or EU.
---
Safoi from Templis CALSF is from there so he should be attending.
---
Why did EvE Radio close? 
---
lol xd suicide gank 200m hauler 
---
eLIte GoN btw
---
&gt;ections to people hunting them down.  You want to play like an NPC?  Then you shall suffer as all NPCs have suffered bef
---
Yeah, I always criticized people who only play AFK or just farm. They don't explore other aspects of the game. Why are you playing if are just gonna farm or play AFK?
---
I have the same access as everyone else, though "the guy" you're talking about (former CCP Logibro) wasn't working for CCP during the last AT.
---
EVE NT can handle the broadcast side of things, but the resources to have a good tournament (practice server, iterated rules, etc) are on CCP's side and I guess they didn't have the right amount of resources with their entire team running around the world for Fanfest On the Run or w/e it is.
---
Part 5! This one is kinda funny!
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjpgEDTfx2w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjpgEDTfx2w)
---
I was talking about the eve_nt's own tournament, not the AT.
---
I still waiting for 'remove duplicates' button in bookmarks. So I can trade all my bookmarks from one account to the other copy them to my bookmarks and remove duplicates.

 Not to mention tethering is one of the main contributors to todo 
---
Might as well just give them 20k ehp shield with a 2000 ehp/s peak regen at that point. Cause citadels are almost never going to be manned when the shield are being shot.
---
Us and Canada are pretty much the same thing. I'm msg safoi in game, thx
---
You misspelled crabbing 
---
It's actually the law in China that any foreign company must partner with a domestic company, not an option.
---
Flatterers, the lot of you!
---
aww, lovely, enjoy yourselves ‚ú®‚ô•Ô∏è
---
We will! :)
---
Current system is worse. Grind isk with rorquals and inject more rorqual pilots with isk and grind more isk with rorquals. Boring as hell. It's totally different game that what I started playing back in the day. How the fuck did we come to this?
---
fuck brisc rubal!
---
Dude's twitch sucked. Bleh PvE content and a weird vibe of fame desperation-driven giveaways.
---
I don‚Äôt particularly see what the point of removing panic is ultimately except to make it easier for people to kill rorqs with hazing fleets. That removes content as it prevents a real response.
---
Guy tells me to kill myself and suddenly it‚Äôs my fault. 
---
well, in that case, go! 
---
Ummm, Pearl Abyss is a South Korean based company. 
---
It was a NSH/DHSJ dread bomb. The same guys in the rattles who you guys were shooting. lol
---
I actually solo pvp'ed before joining a null blob fest, without doing too terribly.
---
On fleets however I derp way harder than I did solo, because I often fall between "autistically do what FC says no matter what" and "what the fuck are you/he doing, just play as you normally would", and end up making decisions that are worse than if I picked either alternative.
---
Local Is Primary was fleeted with BL. for this.
---
11 year player here; I've burned out a few times, but still love the game and find myself coming back for more.
---
You will be fine.  War decs are in the process of being changed and suicide gankers are overblown.
---
There is also new abyssal PvE sites that may be your alley.  
---
I would also suggest you look into joining a low sec group.  Yes you may lose some ships but you will have fun and will have access to DED sites that can be run with a cloaky  t3.  
---
Nice try CCP..... I almost fell for it. I still wont forgive you for the fact your main keynote of Eve Vegas had nothing to do with Eve. 
---
Wait, Netease the email/news site Netease?
---
It didn't say commitment to the AT, they said the 'tradition' of 'alliance contests' which was clearly worded very deliberately.
---
Congrats on being born youngling!
---
Stay away from everybody wearing black (so like 95% of the EVE nerds) and bring lots of deodorant, not for you, but for other EVE nerds because they never seem to fucking put any on.
---
Right after the cruiser buffs, that was the best time ever.
---
eve community really needs to grow up, I appreciate for many of you eve is all you have down in that basement where you can pretend to be.. something other than your sad little self but it is probably about time you took a step forward, leave the house and let the sun hot your face for longer than 5 seconds.  
---
 "he banned you because you PM'd mod mail every single time"  
---
seriously? so basically he banned someone because he personally found them annoying? well shit if that's not an abuse of power (LOL power..) I don't know what is.  
---
"If you all want an example of the kinds of shit Olmeca wastes our time with" no you fucking moronic monkey of a man, if I wanted that sort of attention..  
---
id want to be a moderator. If you cant take the heat, don't be a mod; idiot.  
---
"Maybe it's because you cry in modmail when someone calls you lonely?"  Aaaaawwww‚Ä¶ with statements like that how do you actually expect anyone in real life to take you seriously? Honestly your not the only tool here but fuck me I can't imagine how socially inept all you people are in normal social circles; is this why your all such .. I don't know retarded I guess, some shit like that like honestly how many of you actually talk to people like that on road??  
---
get a fucking grip jesus, you have no business talking to people like this if you don't walk the walk.  
---
kids these days..
---
I miss 2003... fuck I feel old.
---
Maybe on biomass the account can redeem a "Can of green soylent"?
---
That's what I always assumed
---
Much pew pew to be had. DHSJ wanted to formup to keep shoosting you guys, didnt work out &lt;/3.
---
Oh I remember the Anger Games, motherfucking CCP.
---
The supercap inflation we have today is directly caused by two things: the amount of ore mined by rorqual fleets; and the fact that industry citadels have the ability to have an infinite amount of ships in build simultaneously (limited only by the number of industry toons and skills).
---
Rorquals right now, under a supercap umbrella, are essentially invulnerable unless the pilot is a dribbling retard or nobody decides to come rescue them. Even if the pilot is a dribbling retard and allows an inhib to activate before lighting cyno, the duration of the panic is long enough to allow caps to gate to the victim (this has actually happened to me on some of my bomber fleets in Delve).
---
The only way to guarantee a rorqual kill is to have a larger supercap fleet than the defender in range of the rorqual, and that is a very high bar to reach.
---
The supercap proliferation we have today combined with the oppressive nature of the panic module actually removes content by making high concentrations of Rorquals in a single region essentially immune to hostiles.
---
Well if they're fueled, they can use the damage cap for the armor and structure timers, which they'll know about and can prepare for. Why not make shields easy to burn through and set up fights? 
---
I went to the Eve AT viewing party last year (in Nottingham). Despite going alone and knowing no-one I had a great time, I met some real friendly people.
---
A career pivot into customer service would be a bold move with my near decade of graduate school efforts, but thanks for your insight.  
---
But 
---
&gt;Meanwhile they fired everyone last year who helped with the biggest player run tournament: eve_nt
---
As the ~e-sports director for EVE NT~ I wanted to clarify that statement: they legit didn't fire anyone who helped run the tournament last year.  They did fire the guy who put oodles of work into the tournament for the year *before* that (and before that, and before that, and before that).  
---
That was another thought I was worried about, going solo. Glad to hear you had a good time.
---
Ah my bad.  Though I'm pretty sure that EVE NT will host a tournament of some type this calendar year.
---
why would you do that? :(
---
If it's anything like the events they ran previously, they have a standard PvP overview.  It's not the garbage default overview.  Fingers crossed, otherwise lmao
---
South China, west Chiba who cares all chinese look the same anyway /s
---
Biomass yourself and remake your account for proof
---
It just throws me off every time, since it was the reverse before.
---
One could easily justify the other side. Blue because "launchable", grey because already launched.
---
If EVE Echoe's was linked with actual EVE online, I think people would be way more receptive to that. Being able to use your phone as a client would help tremendously on a lot of things. Just being able to farm ore or something while you're on your break at work etc. 
---
It would also introduce a huge new player base into our world in EVE, but separating the 2 clients from each other means we are in competition with that market, and they can easily crush us, so this is why we are more less against it.
---
What huge chunk of pvp ?
---
I literally just made a post saying the same thing. If the clients were linked to the single shard on eve, literally no one would have an issue and I think people would actually be excited to see how many new players would fill our universe.
---
That's clever. You'd think america would have that kind of law but no fuck us apparently. 
---
Can confirm, I run the only powered citadels where I live
---
I'm sure. Not a moon miner myself though. A friend told me his corp was popping a moon, and I've never seen it before, so I figured I'd swing by.
---
They are the on the front lines in terms of nonconsensual PVP. Primary targets of all ganks, freighter ganks, gate camps, mission ganks, I mean we are gonna act like that would exist if these people didn't play the game?
---
tldr:  Init wants to assert themselves from being another pet in the pound.  Goes to Hakonen, camps Jan gate.  Hilarity ensues
---
Is this 2023. ?
---
all i can say is that this is good for bitcoin
---
I'm curious what you're referring to. the only thing  I've read so far about skills was theboption to buy them from the menu would be a slight markup to keep skillbook trading profitavle. 
---
While I am sure that this unfortunate incident has been an uncomfortable disruption in their delivery of missiles and missile-related products, I am confident  their team will recover.
---
If you didn‚Äôt redeem more stuff before his suspension than you‚Äôd know he wasn‚Äôt suspended for View botting or RMT. 
---
You‚Äôll get your chance to redeem more items, he‚Äôs back. He was given a 24 hour suspension for having the ‚ÄúBe back shortly‚Äù sign up too long while afk with the stream running. 
---
No violation of EVE rules, just a Twitch rule broken. He works remotely from home, with a decent rig set up, while streaming simple PvE content and routinely has to mute to handle work related business. 
---
Far from the great evil that‚Äôs portrayed and I am sure not the first or last streamer to receive such a suspension.  
---
i linked in main post

"Wow Para how do you afford it?"

"Easy, I don't pay rent!"

that's the great part of eve online, even if you exclusively pve for 10 years without a single kill your hauling alt can still be killed against your consent and contribute to the actual in game world https://zkillboard.com/kill/75457292/

Must've missed some of that when i was gkancing through yesterday

In ship hangers, they are ejected then a capsuleer has to warp in and board them.

who's ray, and why is he being traced

It will help not only server performance, it will help your pc performance. 32bit has a memory limit. While 64 technically has one also, it‚Äôs alot larger than 32bit.
---
I‚Äôve tried to look in w-space but had a hard time to find and low power ships. And as a solo player it is hard to fight a group of say, 5 people let alone with one of them gunning a 5K dps. Citadel
---
This change will be great. It will add a larger isk sink which will help the economy. 
---
There's too much free isk in game due to "Skill Farm: Online".  Skill price changes were bound to happen sooner or later...

This guy is 97% balls.

Hey at least we aren't eating planets with rourqs yet \*winks\*

If you'd have a look at his discord, he told why he is suspended. He's been afk, cause he didn't feel good. Someone reported him beeing afk, but streaming, and this is why he has been suspended for a single day. He'll be back online tomorrow ;)
---
Man you guys needs to chill.  This is literally just a continuation of an annual niche event, not a replacement for anything.  
---
Every official EVE event has some sort of PvP contest that's slapped together by the Community team.  Last year at Fanfest it was pre-made ships for the Caldari Cup.  The year before that it was Gnossis duos that you had a minute to fit from a random selection of  mods, and a year or two before that it was some Dust-Eve tie in that kinda made no sense at all.  I won a case of beer, it was pretty dope.
---
It's not ~elite competitive EVE gameplay~, but it's not trying to masquerade as that either.  It's literally just "hey, what's a good way to get autists to actually socialize at these social events...oh yea let's make them play the game together that'll be a good autist-breaker".  They even said "yo this isn't a replacement for the AT, we're not trying to make it that".  If you wanna cry ~but muh optics, the timing, too s00n~ the first event starts in 3 weeks lmao

The new devblogs look promising. Keep it up you guys!

Not gonna lie, I was suprised by how much I like the content in the upcoming updates. I'm pretty hopeful about the future.

aaaand the prices are going up based on speculation now lol

Very interesting and I‚Äôm sure that will come in handy. I should have clarified that I just started playing again, so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to login to Sisi at all until the next mirror happens

You'd think it would be simpler to keep everyone else the same and lower the rates for USD.

Yeah what's so amusing? Do you think a keepstar ever 5 jumps is good for Eve?

I'm actually more shocked that you were able to get PvP content in a Maelstrom.  One of my fav ships all time to fly because of the button mashing adrenaline.

Never not shaky hands

Amen.

The Jag is a BEAST, good choice.

Who can?

Dreads are big. How many fit in *your* hand?
---
I wasn't there, only heard second-hand. Which is why the vague wording.
---
It changes the outcome majorly.
---
Now instead of reinforcing 60 astrahauses in a few hours they can only do 4 or 5.
---
The mechanics of no limits is already abused. Actually ANY mechanic will be abused given time.  That's why devs supposed to keep churning the Meta. Sadly Eve devs Haven done anything relevant in terms of forcing players to adapt recently

I surely hope a receipt was written up.

\*Runs to market to buy Titan and Capital books\*
---
and then there were spaceship explosions riiiiggghht?
---
I can't imagine they would raise the cost of capital books that high (four times the current cost). The higher proliferation of caps and Titans than whenever the books were priced kind of justifies the lower cost.
---
Unless if CCP did it to deliberately reduce capital and Titan proliferation. That would be pretty surprising though to be honest

You're welcome for all of the SOE probes and launchers.

poland is stagnating, not in a depression like germany, but it might get pulled in, like the rest of the EU atm.

then we have prices in asia and....yeah.

it becoems easier to use your home country as a "base" currency to base everything else off of.

So how do you propose to reduce the current citadel spam? Isn't the ability to kill lots of them quickly needed to solve that problem?

I was being sarcastic. Mac is good for home use and playing iTunes. It's very difficult to network and centrally manage macs in an enterprise environment.

Tethering stops content, period.

Full removal might be strong, but inst-saftey is still bullshit if you manage to get into warp. Tethering should not be an invulnerability beam

The memories I've made while playing Eve are so great. 
---
The people I've become friends and enemies with will surely rest in my mind til the day I die.

I'll always come back to Eve.

I love all the industry in Eve.

See you all in space &lt;3
---
Folks purchase them and bring them to trade hubs lel.
---
If you load up the itty while your sitting in it you can fill it to your max capacity then you just leave the ship
---
The fact of the matter is nothing stays the same in eve that's why we love it. RvB style was amazing when it hit the game at the right time. 
---
Those endless welps of ships crashing into each other hour after hour have most definitely past. What it has left is a community that doesn't fear undocking and taking any fight. If we win or lose it doesn't matter we will fight on.
---
In eve you must adapt or you will die, sadly the old style of game play we had isn't wanted in the eyes of everyone or if it was they would all be in RvB it's that simple. 
---
What is left is a strong light hearted community that still values what RvB stood for but applies them to the world which is eve today not what it was 20 odd patch days ago.
---
So please come join the mad house if you don't like it at least you can say you have been!
---
Not sure, was hoping someone would see this post and let us know.
---
I've only heard of a few being busted by twitch for this and it's almost all the upper tier popular streamers, not nickel and dime eve streamers. He got busted for something else, likely TOS like you say.
---
Where do they drop? Any specific mission?
---
Only AC that would be good with a 100mn AB would be the Ishtar, but other ships like the VNI, scythe fleet issue and T3 cruisers benefit more from it.
---
Npc seeded plenty of those. 
---
they never did it maybe it is time for it.

Operation NPC slap was a complete success. There wasn't even any rep cost since I didn't actually do any relevant damage to them. Made 45 million isk today from the one asteroid belt today. It usually runs closer to 30 million isk if the NPC miners don't show up too early.

WHY ARE YOU UPVOTING THIS THREAD HI-SEC IS A NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE; HOW DO YOU THINK I ENDED UP LIKE I AM
---
What you said may be a lot of things but it's not economics.
---
Pretty sure all t1/meta mods are random chance for mission and anom rats
---
Are you just pretending the new default overview is still complete garbage? 
---
Where does the 0.3% for buying come from?
---
I mean why would you quit, like the more math i do the subject the more this seem like a reduction in your operating cost, i mean maybe the neutral logi but even that like hurts both sides really ( it rewards less preparation before you take a fight ). 
---
At least they are not a bunch of miss nancy multiboxing botting in null-sec with their carriers and navy vexors and acting superior.
---
How does the 64bit client boost server performance?
---
&gt;  They even said "yo this isn't a replacement for the AT, we're not trying to make it that"
---
Isnt this the exact problem though? saying they are committed while doing the exact opposite?
---
Third is why you get them both at the same time.
---
Dog keeps the cat in check lol
---
yay! you're welcome!

I want to thank all the PVPers that try and have killed my highsec and lowsec mining fleets. I dont play in those places to be safe.. i play there for the randomness that comes with it. All of you are part of that randomness and are all appreciated :)

60% in highsec, no way!
---
yeah it's a great ship for sure. 6 people treid to blob me the other day and i was just totally fine, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS03BFbJfhE
---
Literally unplayable. 
---
No, instead they multibox 30 bot alpha mining battleships and use 1 omega orca account to scoop the jet cans with mtu/tractors (also a bot)
---
You didn't hear it from me, but Brave faxes have to carry at least one set of salvage drones in order to be eligible for SRP.
---
How does it work exactly? Is a titan like a mobile citadel?
---
Pretty sure loot tables aren't based on missions but race and size.  
---
For the FS-9's, you're more likely to get them from shield rats, so that means shooting Guristas. 
---
Actually, I have anthem and B5, and both are completely playable with RTX enabled... They patched the issues they were having.
---
Skill farm online does not add more isk into the game. It just changes hands from 1 player to the other. In fact, it takes isk out of the game through brokers fees and taxes. 
---
literally will not change my post or my BR even in the slightest.
---
I've been to a bunch of EVE Dublin's at this point and thoroughly enjoyed every time so far. Similar to other stories here I knew nobody going in - just met random people and talked about whatever. It's great craic.
---
It doesn‚Äôt. The server is 64bit, already.
---
Regarding the radio station itself, the website was down for a few days.
---
Glad to say that it's back up on its normal domain, Eve-Radio.com
---
(I have no formal affiliation with Eve Radio)
---
New Tardis ship confirmed.
---
Where do you do missions for SOE stuff? 
---
Yeah it's supercarriers online that really does the inflation.
---
Dry runs have been done. Tons of work by the administration team lead by Ivy for Evenorth has been her baby for a long time now. She has been doing gods work and the team leaders have done an amazing job getting out to th3 vendors and such. Mix that with a "dry run" last night by about 12 of the administration team and team leaders, was a great success. We ironed out a few details and as we get closer and closer, the little things will become less and less. 
---
Between the great food, amazing environment that our admin team brings to our beloved Toronto meet ups. Evenorth lead by Ivy and CCP will be nothing short of rivaling Iceland.  
---
love good fights like that, sadly too far and few it seems for most.
---
 I wonder if HS will actually become the best place for small gang and solo fights, I mean no capitals is defanatly a plus for that!
---
 Worst shakes I've ever had during pvp I was actually dragging modules around trying to  activate them lol, spastic mouse hand.
---
I actually think this is one area of the game that needs serious attention. Both mining and missioning are very legacy systems and the content is pretty cringy.
---
I suspect if they invested some time in these systems (and maybe didn't make mission running a hi-sec only activity) they'd see an uptick in engagement and DAU. This could lead into low/nullsec population increases overtime.
---
As it stands new players enter the game through these very old systems and game mechanics only to filter out  rapidly due to the staleness. Instead they should serve to funnel fresh players through the on-boarding experience and outward to the more dangerous and dynamic corners of the game.
---
I don't know, there surely is no silver bullet but I do wish the first things my friends did when entering the game weren't these aspects. Also sorry for kind of hijacking, I too am glad there is still a large population of people occupying the core.
---
it's the reinforcement timers. A structure bash with a boom at the end is generally more fun. 
---
&gt; People are saying that new price for capital book will be 2bil and around 20bil for a titan book. 
---
People say a lot of things. Most of them extremely wrong. 
---
&gt;...  do you think that CCP will hurt this way people without the capital skills? 
---
500m vs 2b doesn't really make a huge difference for caps in the long run, to be honest. It's a slightly higher barrier, but a couple of billion ISK aren't what they used to be. Even high-sec scrubs can accumulate that now in reasonable time.
---
20b for a Titan book would be slightly excessive, in my opinion, but people going for Titans are usually pretty determined and won't be deterred by that. Large null empires will probably provide that to pilots if necessary if it adds +1 to their Titan fleet.
---
CCP tend to make all changes with the largest null-sec blocs in mind. And in this meta, where people are unironically Titan ratting in many null-sec areas, this probably seems like a perfectly reasonable change. Of course people who aren't part of the null empires will suffer most by the changes, but that's normal in EVE.

Last years eve Vegas was my first. I found it a very rewarding experience to meet and chat with randoms about their playstyle and history (being an 07 player I was able to tell them stories about things they only read about). You know how when you meet a stranger there's sometimes an awkward pause? Not with eve people because you automatically have a topic of conversation to dive into.
---
Also met several corp members I've played with since 2009.
---
A big misconception is that eve players are straight you need to make all your articles slightly erotic in a gay way to appeal to your audience. E.g instead of XIX got dumpstered you write they got anally penetrated.
---
can you write a battle report on me versus depression
---
Im sorry for your loss
---
Higher level missions pop in Lowsec.
---
You don't have to bring them with you. Its a thought they can always be there but nul is almost like printing isk
---
yeah man, send me some context.
---
ok
---
Is the game worth getting (back) into right now?
---
I never really enjoyed/was good at pvp, i mostly just played it as a space sim vs the pirates.
---
Have about 1.3 bil + a couple of pirate BShips. Fully fitted, though minimal faction mods. I could take on most or all 'normal' t4 missions solo - the few times i tried the frigate assassinations, i got my ass utterly handed to me.
---
Haven't played for realz in about 5 years, just dabbled a little on a low-skill alt flying a ulgos in t1 mishes.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/EV0pPpG](https://imgur.com/a/EV0pPpG)
---
it's 100% speculation and would be a really awful idea because the mega alliances already have the resources they need to force feed more titan pilots if they need them. 2bil 20bil 200bil for a skillbook won't mean anything. 
---
The change won't affect people who can afford to pay the new price and it won't affect people who already have it. The only thing that changing the price upwards could do is harm the newer players and put them even further behind.
---
Problem is not the deodorant. But people not showering at all for weeks. As long as you shower every day there is no way you'll smell like 5 day old sweat walking around. 
---
I don't really expect the overall prices to change that much; instead I think they're going to remove some of the weird price spikes that at currently present. I don't see any reason for example why the dread book is 100m when the carrier and rorq book is 500m.
---
I was seriously havin' withdrawl. I missed this game and the mofos I'd grown to love so much.

If they change the price of skill books, even for things like Titan skill books - the wealth folks will just buy a shitload at the current prices and make huge profits over time.

eve is a drug.

i would love to meme this, however its pretty unethical and immoral. Good luck with the road ahead man.

You realize that is exactly what happens today with the damage cap right? You can toss one dread (4 for a keepstar) on a structure and just pause the timer. As I've stated multiple times in this thread, as long as you're willing to eat a few lossmails structures are un-defendable. All the damage cap does is make killing small undefended structures annoying as hell.

Are hisec DED sites still viable? What can you expect to make per site? There are all these videos of people walking out with 50m isk faction modules, but it seems likely that those are rare drops, and prices have dropped since then. 
---
lasted longer than last test campaign tbf
---
Thank you! I transport probes to null with heavy markups. Very good margin.
---
I‚Äôm assuming that this is for faction warfare lowsec in which case the best advice is...don‚Äôt use a Punisher. It is a terrible solo ship because the 2 mid slots means you lack any range control and will lose to anyone who isn‚Äôt terrible.

Try a Tormentor instead, you can find a fit from my zkill (same as my reddit name)

You're not wrong. The people are intoxicating. Even if you're the one fucking people up.

a while back i was getting deployed a lot. Came back to my wife having a boyfriend, life is strange man, and depression really sneaks in later too, that shit sucks. Im glad its better for you
---
uncontested structure bashes have always been boring for most members of large groups, the dominion sov system was designed to greatly reduce the number of structure bashes that had to be done in order to take space because the biggest issue that people had been complaining about for the longest time was having to clear 5-100 structures for every system whenever they invaded a region.
---
No-one likes being forced to do something where the only game play involves making sure you turn your guns on every time they reload. Giving small easily spamed structures a damage cap doesn't make it more likely that something exciting will happen, it just means that people are forced to spend more time doing uncontested structure bashes instead of interesting things.
---
:(( I sympathize. The last couple weeks I've been doing nothing but watching Stargate: SG1.......... AND ATLANTIS! That's how long my shiz been broke.
---
2b lost, someone call fox news
---
I think so yeah.
---
Yep, no other game like it
---
We didn't even shoot a damn thing on this fleet but it felt so good to be back and get shhhhhhh'd in voice. That feeling of being part of something huge is just so fun. :D (j/k no one had to shhh me this time, I'm learning!)
---
Think the point their making is to but before the price increase.
---
You can multi box with alphas?
---
Who said Eve Radio closed in the first place? Because if Phreakbee, the ER manager, did not inform you it was closed, or going to close down, then what you heard was a lie. Sometimes, the sites data can get all borked. There are a lot of things that make the site run. SSR had the same issue as well. 
---
I know it might be hard to believe but sometimes I get too excited.
---
I'm starter corp and have a supercarrier so isk is kind of meh be it supers in general are far to common.

Thanks I wish I would have know this before blowing up 4 punishers last night.... tonight we torment?!

Well‚Ä¶ that and just being the majority of players, thus keeping the lights on for the rest of us.
---
It's a start.  Good behavior should be rewarded so that further good behavior can flourish.  /u/jintaan, it is a start.  We like the start, but we would like more better.  
---
&gt;  Being there for some times makes sure the defenders can start an engagement 
---
How does a damage cap accomplish that goal better than a reinforcement timer?
---
suggestion, join a null alliance and mine with them, be safer, have more fun, make more isk, and be able to go on awesome fleets. 
---
Brave and Horde are v good. Im personally in horde and i love it

correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the best way to help diversity to NOT isolate LGBT into one alliance?

How lucrative is titan rating?
---
True, true but we have to start somewhere. :P
---
Yeah, you just have to start each of the accounts really quickly.
---
big day today. our corp citadel's final timer is running out in less than 24 hours but we won't go down without a fight. 
---
&gt;fired.
---
I've seen people stream themselves Titan ratting. One goon I watched was making around 150m isk per tick. (450m/hr)
---
Yeah, you didn‚Äôt know alphas can run incursions now?
---
Of course!
---

---
There is already a big alliance full of LGBT people called Northern Coalition

---
Great fun fleet would do again...
---
we need good isk sinks - this was long overdue
---
What is the character name?
---
You should take a screenshot with the estimated prices on it.
---
So once the CCP boosts the prices everyone will try to sell them and the market will adjust the price to be \~5% higher than it is now.
---
Okay, I guess it's my turn to be "that guy" but here we go:    
---
Coming back after a bit over a year, where can I get updated on what has happened since then in the best way. (instead of going through 1year worth of patch notes. :/    
---
Just the main things are enough I guess.   
---
New ships, new content, changes to politics/war/sov, etc.    
---
Anything really worth mentioning? Assault frigates still a meme?     
---
Still mad-hotdropping in lowsec? (you know the "let's drop some carriers on that solo vexor" stuff)
---
what has happened with aeons and xlsma?
---
No changes to Cap tossing? :/ That's a downer for sure.
---
prices are npc
---
geez. I AM out of the loop.
---
I dont think there is any grey area here. they are NOT having a yearly Alliance contest. Regardless of the angle you approach this, they are spitting in the face of the Alliance Tournament community while telling them they actually do care. Personally I wait each year to see if the perfect storm of availability time and other circumstances will allow me to compete once more. But no, CCP kick us in the nuts by pulling the AT, then add insult to injury by claiming it has AT at heart. this genuinely has me questioning why i continue to support CCP and usually i'm not so alarmist, especially in regard to CCP.

To expand on what Falcon said, they freed up names used in trial accounts that had never subbed some time back in (I think) late 2014/early 2015. This was pre-Alpha so at the time they could easily spot a large number of names being held by trial accounts which were never used.
---
In the lead up to Alphas, CCP backpedaled on the name emancipation so old trial characters regained their old names unless someone else had stepped in and made a new character with the name.
---
With Alphas now a thing it'd be hard to realistically identify an abandoned character.
---
I like this idea, I War declaration module.  Worth a lot, and you have to lock in a weeks worth of the fuel with it. You can add more though for continued wardecs.
---
That way defenders have more of a financial incentive to attack their attacker‚Äôs HQ
---
And it creates an isk sync that feeds off the economy more, rather than just paying into the empty void. 
---
and those high level ones are deffo using it as an excuse

This is a desperate attempt by a highly toxic entity (who btw are widely known for their elite skills at turbobotting, destroying tiny alliances, and beating on mining corps )  to boost declining numbers through rebranding. This is nothing short of USING LGBT people, who are welcome in any corp, to further the goals of an already failed break-away offshoot of Shadow Cartel known as Shoot First.
---
We just released version 1.0.7 which has a more advanced trade tool. You now can give in the volume (m3) what is available in your ship and it will give results for that.

---
The reinforcement timer states the time for battle, the cap stats the (minimum and maximum) time the battle can last
---
/r/Evejobs is that way. 
---
That's what I'm saying though, you add another big gun but actually include good controls from keeping them rare and expensive. Maybe introduce a blueprint that only appears when there are 10 or fewer megatitans in the world, or, I don't know, maybe they literally just fucking self destruct a few days after being created, meaning that you have to constantly build new ones and can't build a real fleet of them. There's got to be a way to do it that isn't a stupid repeat of the past. 
---
OfSoundMind might be right up your alley
---
&gt; they are NOT having a yearly Alliance contest
---
they're certainly not having a yearly AT, but the wording suggests they will run some kind of scuffed arranged combat much like these "invasion tournaments" and call it a continuation of the tradition.
---
What you're saying makes sense. However, I have zero confidence CCP can implement something like this without fucking up balance, even more that it currently is.
---
Only he is in clear violation of CCP TOS with his RMT. Before long he will be streaming Fortnite because he has no Eve Online accounts.

Omg alert the media! Goons destroyed 4 billion worth of ships.

90% of the territory north of Toronto is populated by less than 1 human per 2 kilometers.  But I bet it's just *full* of Eve players.

---
&gt;You guys, and the high sec mining/indy guys, play a huge role in the content in EVE. People like myself love talking about the pvp aspect, but without you guys playing and enjoying the pve aspects of the game the game would be missing out a huge chunk of pvp that goes on every day.  
---
&gt;Among the many changes going on in eve right now, I hope they do give better incentives for players in high sec considering like 60% of the population play there.
---
Not to mention a lot of these players are single or double subbed accounts and PLEX suppliers via their occasional purchases. I don't need to point out what happens if they start leaving right ?
---
Where'd the goonswarm bee come from?
---
I see you have the GSF tag. Did you read the wiki? I mean, you are probably the guy that asked this on the forums rather recently too.
---
bring up Agency, you'll see some drop down filters. select SOE, select agent level, agent type, etc. 
---
Can you AAR the sex we had last night? 
---
Careful you don't cut yourself on all that edge or mommy might deduct Good Boy Points from you.
---
They do need attention. There has been a lot of talk about how brainded some of tehse things are, but many people forget that a chunk of players that run these do not have full level 5 skills, are still alphas or do not fly blinged ships.
---
If you do this content on their level, then that difficulty takes on a whole new meaning. And they do need the content, they can't stay in game and not do it while waiting on 20+ days ques for level 5 skills.
---
&gt;Isnt this the exact problem though? this 2v2 format in no way relates to the AT.
---
It's a PvP competition with a prize, announced 2 weeks after the AT was put on hiatus.  It's not a far stretch for DOOM AND GOOMERS (aka EVEs entire playbase) to assume that CCP were trying to make this a replacement for the AT
---
&gt;Maybe i need to disparage people to make my point in your eye, eh elise?
---
There are some, yes. But I have to say, the amount of these sort of bots in comparison with NS bots is ultra low. Even the distribution bots as well. 
---
The reason being these are basically NS bots without their skills up to par yet, so the bot owner makes the most use of them while they are still in training.
---
I'm ok with this.
---
While I agree - capitals that could serve this function would be awesome (and personally something I expected way back when, but was disappointed to find out wasn't a thing) - I think balancing it would definitely be problematic.
---
A small change like simply allowing pilots to "dock" into the ship maintenance bay would be nice. I'm not sure how it would balance, but leaving the ship maintenance bay sizes unchanged could still facilitate gangs fairly well.
---
But in terms of balance - whether a capsuleer uses a titan bridge or gets jumped while docked in a carrier/supercarrier/titan they should still get a fatigue timer.
---
And what all would the change apply to? I feel like docking in a dread doesn't really fit, whereas docking in a carrier makes perfect sense. Also, docking in a Rorq or even an Orca makes sense as well, TBH.
---
But also - how would docking dynamics play out? You wouldn't get a hangar like you would in a citadel - I'd say it just boots you into the ship view (like viewing the external view on a citadel) and you can wait or undock. If the carrier pilot logs off you would get ejected.
---
But in the long run, I think this sort of change just adds too much work. This being said, they are bringing a rapid deployment citadel are they not? A forward operating base - a FLEX Structure. If you remember the announcement: [https://www.eveonline.com/article/phs7yj/navigation-structures-inbound](https://www.eveonline.com/article/phs7yj/navigation-structures-inbound)
---
&gt; Upwell is investigating other potential uses for the FLEX structure technology, including potential capsuleers advertisement/propaganda structures and potential capsuleer-built forward operating bases. 
---
It's not confirmed, but if they do make a FLEX FOB it would be awesome as well for different reasons.
---
I don't frequent the forums, and... shit, there's a goonswarm wiki?
---
...my comrades were not forthcoming in this regard
---
I don't venture into Null often. So, whenever I saw these types of comments, I kind of shrugged them off thinking it was just few bad apples that did this. However, a buddy of mine and I took a couple low cost frigs out for random fun and the amount of this exact shit that we saw was mind boggling. I started feeling like the only human player. It was rather eerie. Systems with 40+ people saying nothing in local when I would say something. VNIs warping back to their structures. Nyx's sitting tethered for the entire duration I was in a systrm. I don't get it.
---
You mean you really have to talk about sexual preferences in corp chat? Why?
---
Oh sorry. Agent level 4s. But shouldn't be a problem for abyss lvl 2s 
---
You clearly haven't heard about Tikle.
---
Yes, a PVP game with a player based economy can only function if there are people who enjoy keeping the economy going and providing prey for the PVPers. It's important that CCP keeps these people happy and engaged.
---
A revamp of missions and anomalies is long overdue. One aspect of that is making them harder to bot or AFK in nullsec, which we often talk about, but making them more interesting for players who enjoy PVE as an active playstyle is also important.
---
fair enough. try using the deadeye guided missile projection, target navigation prediction  and rapid launch. 3s should be about 20mil a pop and do help quite a bit, but i use 5s which of course are pricey. 
---
People can't make distinctions
---
Check pyfa or zkillboard.
---
Official forums also have some great entries under ships and modules.
---
 If they do, then it's working lol.  
---
But seriously though, just the thought that someone somewhere in the game, even if I never see them, would appreciate that I'm playing the game, makes me really want to start paying this game. 
---
gallente cruiser prices increased 1000x to slow botters
---
I knew i named my vni money printer for a reason
---
Yeah, forums are overratted, same with jabber and mumble. Who needs that in a alliance when you have a corp discord to chatz in

[Your mama's so ugly...](https://i.imgur.com/De0XJa7.jpg)
---
That‚Äôs absolutely insane, he must have been using implants, full skills, faction mods, and neglected safety measures (align to safety instead of the next site).
---
Aspiring super ratters can not expect to make this amount of isk.
---
&gt; In the lead up to Alphas, CCP backpedaled on the name emancipation so old trial characters regained their old names unless someone else had stepped in and made a new character with the name.
---
That isn't true, I had a character that was in that state and I had to petition to get her name back.
---
&gt; With Alphas now a thing it'd be hard to realistically identify an abandoned character.
---
X days without logging into the account. You'd want X to be quite long (5 years?), but it seems pretty easy to detect.
---
Great thank you!  
---
and the price will steadily go up after the next update since you won't be able to pull lvl4-5 missions from alpha accounts anymore
---
you are aware RMT stands for Real Money Trading and therefore cannot happen if real money never enters the equation.
---
The problem is this game can not capture a new player it needs a big meta shift and better first month mechanics for a new player. They need to add a few mods that make some of the cheese pvp builds less face roll
---
We have had our differences in Vastly with other Alliances but that is the nature of EVE.
---
Wait what jump mechanic?
---
That's.... likely now how it works. 
---
If anything, lots of clients crashing randomly puts more stress on the servers. Lots of clients trying to re-login at the same time, all trying to load-grid simultaneously, etc. 
---
Client stability is what you want here. 
---
yes, 10mn ab is oversized prop mod, and will generally require you do make sacrifices on other slots.
---
I would say they could be tiered like this:
---
Dreads - small fleet bay half or less than what- they already have like 300k m3 which is three cruisers or so iirc
---
Carriers - larger fleet bay, like they have it now - 1mil m3 - thats two battleships, or 10 cruisers 
---
supercarriers - the largest fleet hangar size - 2.5 mil now afaik
---
titans - smaller fleet size but you can also install a clone and reapawn to it when you die.
---
Tbh with these changes you might also remove regular  bridging and keep just the covops one.
---
Ships docked in should not get fatigue - you could project subcaps a lot, with the drawback that you need to expose a cap/supercap if ypu want to.
---
Osmon!

Our alliance chat is pretty normal. It is just in local we have been called the flying f.a.\*.g.o.t.s. and that is just plain uncalled for.
---
Given people(bots) dick each other over .01 isk I can see it.
---
get out of potato mode...
---
dread books more expensive?  
---
Like there is no reason to make capital skillbooks more expensive.          
---
It is not that **they are expensive now**
---
I don't know the finer details of super/titan ratting - having never done it myself - but this dude was streaming himself doing it so he was definitely achieving it somehow.
---
Noob
---
But I can do something with it just fine. I can stop it just like I could start it. It makes no sense to be gray. 
---
P.S. and while you are at it bring back the colored icons in the neocom! This minimalist $hit has gotten old before it started....
---
I dunno what it is.. I enjoy the carebear life.
---
Played for 2 years and lost three dozen ships or so, I was giddy the other day when I landed a shot on a pirate who jumped my wormhole pve fleet and got on a kill mail.
---
I'm only 99% snuggly now, so watch out New Eden!
---
that, and have a limit of one structure currently anchoring per system... maybe even have the mechanic so that the initial 15 minutes, it's not protected by concord either, so either you get a quiet time/place, or you have to be able to defend the structure during the initial pre-anchoring vuln; but i'm not actually familiar with how things currently go in hs, so that part might just be bs
---
Yeah I forgot about that part, which just makes it even *weirder*.
---
Don't remind me of the pain of 10m Y-T8's and 25m IFFAs (back when plex were 200m). 
---
the answer is not as it was a 1 day suspension for "miscategorized content"
---
Technically your pod‚Äôs shell has been breached. That should be a clone jump.
---
Don't Look Back in Anger.
---
Sounds like your having fun.  i really wish more newbro's were like you.  You said you lost 2 or 3 ships when out exploring New Eden.  You didn't get butt hurt over it.  You approached it with a level head and looked at what you could of improved and learnt a few things from those situations; instead of thinking the game owed you something.  
---
A little research and knowledge has set you back on the right track and your now off exploring the game again.  Take every situation as a learning experience and think of ways to overcome each situation and you will have a lot of fun or achieve your goals.
---
Good luck on your journey.
---
so buff structures that they can actually kill a reasonable solo dread? i mean, it's kinda ridiculus that they can't already, at least below a fortizar
---
I agree, I have been to 2 fanfests and EVE vegas. I will go again.   
---
Also, Canadians are nicest people ever, (except for Elo).
---
Better yet, a Trig JF whose jump range increases with each jump.  Over do it, and you end up in some random corner of wormhole space.
---
Just dont do firestorms
---
Sorry cloudspit, "goes on to say something unrelated to cloudspit"
---
Look cloudspit, EVE is a place where we circlejerk all day while Reddit is where we REeeeaeeeeEeeeee all over the place. I was planning this shitpost for a bit and it coincided with your shit video where I jerk my corpmates off for 15 minutes.
---
"Goon streamer, not goon streamer"
---
What?
---
At a certain point damage is more important for quickly burning down things that will kill you such as triglavians. Also you should be using pretty much only thermal missiles and hammerheads for a firestorm. That 50% damage buff is no joke.
---
Well the battles require Network changes as well as client..so....
