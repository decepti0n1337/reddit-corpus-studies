Yes you can.

That was the last good war in Querious.  And the beginning of the end for ole FIX.
---
I was titan ratting in a -.1 truesec system with only 2 rock havens at around 100-120m ticks with like 5 button clicks ever 4 minutes.  Maybe the mega population of regions like delve worked against you nerds here, but honestly the sparse systems like the ones in provi were superb and I made a pretty substantial amount of isk with almost no effort.  So from my experience the pve nerf was where it was aimed. But whatever, I think it's a weird nerf regardless of pve or pvp focused that won't change the landscape very much.

l know that .. but hes no boat l miss my Jumping Squeaky Bee wearing boat and the WW2 references were am they .... lol

I'm amazed sp hoarding is apparently an actual thing.
---

---
Let alone - whatever kind of hoarding this is. Redemption hoarding?
---
I guess I can sort of see the value of having sp lying around ready to go in case you need it for something right this second later - but why *wouldn't* you at least redeem it?
---
Are people actually this lazy or am I completely missing the point as usual?
---
Even if that were the case, it would take them about as much time to adapt to that as it has taken me to write this comment.
---
I have dipshit. It doesn't work like that. It doesn't even make sense what you're saying.
---
what lol.... I fail to see how putting titans directly next to targets is problematic.  I assert the problem wasn't that the weapon was dangerous and unbalanced, but rather that the umbrella and megablobs that people use to justify safely using them haphazardly are cancerous.
---
why do you call it 300m/hr when it takes 3 toons thats still 100m per toon.
---
Could the font size option apply to the conversation panel as well as the member list (on a per channel basis)?
---
Literally everyone else gets it, so you might want to take a remedial english class.

---
Yes, the game is still enjoyable. It is what you make it, so just dive in and play your game.
---
There are plenty of corps recruiting, which one is right for you ultimately depends on your play style.
---
At least credit Lex with this meme
---
are you allied with GOTG by any chance?
---
Powerful interview full of key information that should benefit all eve players.
---
Facts
---
shall i ref more stuff until you pay me my 25b?
---
We aren't allied with anybody. Just a small NPC null Alliance that is not affiliated with any of the major coalitions.
---
Is it really dank though? I can't figure out why anyone would use the prophecy. Seems quite shit to me.
---
You have to push F to make drones mine, not F1.
---
Also this one: https://zkillboard.com/alliance/173714703/
---
Is there anyone in China to report this to? I wanna see how cowardly CCP actually is.
---
Back in the day, in eve- A larger ship struggled to fight a smaller hull. A battleship's guns can't track a frigate, unless they get lucky. 
---
  A dreadnought wasn't able to hit a cruiser
---
  etc
---
  Caps and supers were designed to fight other caps and supers. 
---
  AOE DD's were removed because they were too OP as titans became more of a thing.
---
  Single shot DD's became the norm- Because they were designed to swing the battle over by instantly destroying a target with a single strike.
---
  Now titans can use cone AOE DD weapons. 
---
  They can fit HAW guns- designed to track and hit subcaps.
---
  You don't see this is a problem?
---
  A titan should NOT be able to mass wipe an entire frigate gang in one shot.
---
  And it should not be able to track frigates/cruisers easily.
---
Why get your hands dirty when you can just padlock the fire exit...
---
Also, I assume that T3  must have had a point to prevent them warping off right?
---
Oh shit I honestly never considered doing this. If you neut someone would the sleepers start primarying you or would the continue to primary the other dude since he'd be using weapons?
---
Honestly they switch targets a lot
---
Ah ok, I was thinking that might be the case. Now I'm wondering what's the best way to go and try this shenanigans in a neuty legion.
---
Why, when there is other screens?
---
I think you can orbit something and your ship will remain in orbit during the DC.  Helps if you know you have DC issues.
---
I can only vote in local elections, not national ones, as I hold permanent residency but not citizenship.
---
Also, our current President is Mun Jaein, a progressive, so it's infinitely better than our conservative dictator Bak Geunhye we had before. Threw her ass in prison.
---
Good.
---
For me this incident was so random as I never had any issues with server at all before this. My alt was hauling fine only toon in abyssal got dc’ed on other client same pc.
---
Thank you!
---
there's a lot worse than my shitposting to keep you from trying eve again, let me tell you.
---
 Statement given earlier today in Vlillirier VII Roden Shipyards Factory Station:
---
Today, friends, colleagues, and citizens of the Federated Union of Gallente Prime, we prepare for a new presidential election. As strong as our Federation remains, whoever leads us forward will face challenges like no others in our history. We are confronted by new mysteries as the Triglavians rise. Our Federal government has kept us in the dark. CONCORD has perpetuated a Tyranny of Lies, releasing barely enough information to puppeteer New Eden into submission. We face crippling corruption in the ranks of the Federal Defense Union. To fight all of these dire threats to our freedom, I announce my candidacy for the Presidency of the Gallente Federation. (...)
---
Then what's the problem? Stop being a pussy.
---
throw out bait then cyno onto him when he attacks you. 
---
Oh wow that was hard.
---
if you know he has a 40man loki fleet why don't you get a fleet ready to bridge to your bait :thonking:
---
Good QOL change
---
Not CCP. National thing. Saw it on the news a bit ago.
---
Just send in a support ticket asking for clarification. And since you arent supposed to share ccp conversations, i guess everyone who wants to know should send in a ticket.
---
We could not use them in geminate, we are only just catching up in terms  of the titan meta because of this.
---
This change does neuter us before we even get started.
---
If you split the rewards you split the reputation gain.
---
God forbid you have to sit actual characters on in gates to your ratting system, right?
---
No, you must have the instant availability of local, or it's not worth. Like I said...welcome to the attitude of 99% of PvErs in Eve 2019
---
lets put it simply, and not count buffs nerfs, cause nullsec has been buffed once, nerfed 100 times and still is OP.   
---
1) Nullsec never had endgame PVE, never. The most isk you could make was carrier ratting and about \~150m/hour with sentries at that time, wormholes/incursions/l5's/fw bombers made more. On the first change hels could do 300m TICKS. This has been nerfed a couple of times and u can still make 100m ticks, thats like double isk/h you could do before. All in all a place that can be accessed by the vast majority of players with ease, with the best logistics in the game, the most players and the biggest safety, should not be endgame income.  
---
2) Safety with citadels, imagine a place where you cant be correctly stop bubbled, has amazing defensive options and in some cases your super can dock in them, now compare that to stations and poses of old, a single sabre warping on a station/known pos would stop you in 90% of occasions, not anymore the case, let alone stuff like keepstar DD etc.       
---
3) Income escalation, you let it too op for so long, that everyone made so much isk they were able to plex/make multiple alts to further fuck the economy and raise their wallet. The fact that in 2019 there is a ship with a GOD mode and you think it is fine explains the state of the game. Rorquals should never have joined in the belts unless it was for links, rorqs and skill injectors are the biggest destroyers of the game/economy.
---
dumpstered* Fucking Grammarly
---
What if I told you that your ship health bars and the targeting system display health drop from right to left?
---
Honestly drones should just have a single form of tank like fighters and just the one health bar. Would be nice.
---
It was a good fight, thanks for the content boys!
---
Factions are like a parent corporation for corporations.
---
If you have good faction standings it kinda overwrites Corp standings if you don't have great Corp standings. This is great if you want to do missions for another Corp but don't want to grind low level missions to get good Corp standings to unlock better agents.
---
This is a pet peeve of mine, when companies swap the order of scaling prices.  It's super easy for someone to click on the $249 when they're used to $39 or similar.  Feels scummy.
---
Biomass yourself
---
For me it’s not about playing suboptimally. It is about acknowledging that CCP is actively trying to provide a balanced good game. And although midmaxing is an important part of eve culture it is also why we see a lot of the issue we see.
---
If in an effort to fight blue donuts CCP announced tomorrow Corps would be capped at 500 player, and alliances at 5 corps and removed the standings mechanic. Within a day we would have used out of game resources to provide lists of who we can and cannot shoot. 
---
Yes that would be the most effective safest thing for people to do, can’t fault them for that. It would also not help the game.
---
Yeah it sucks. At least ccp refunds you if you make the wrong purchase.
---
Instead of giving isk to recruits most people use that isk to stock hangars full of stuff that is for giving out to new players for free. This is less exploitable and ensures that new players get ships to replace their losses so that they don't hurt as bad.
---
Simple answer: No, that's dumb.
---
Good use of motion tracking 10/10!
---
o7
---
I'm not suggesting that change. That's a strawman can you wheel it back out into the yard where it belongs and come back inside when you are ready to have a discussion.
---
Why do people always claim that "THIS ISOLATED THING IS THE ONLY THING KILLING EVE" like sure it's a contributing factor, so treat it as such.
---
The problems come from a wide variety of sources: citadels, capitals, sovereignity, ship balance, quantity of players and kind of players, game mechanics (local etc). Pretending that it all stems from one place is silly.
---
This must be one of the most stupid things I've read on r/eve for quite a while. Who came up with this brilliant idea of giving new players so much money that everything they can do will feel completely useless?
---
It is different in that we want an open world sandbox game. We are supposed to have a degree of control on what happens. 
---
If eve had nothing but matchmaking pvp, no null sec, no player run groups, then sure its problems would be purely development issues. 
---
If a bicycle manufacturer made a bike that was designed to be module so it could be used for a variety of different situations. Add the rider desired to take a wheel of it to make it lighter. Then yes it would be the riders fault when he eats shit.
---
Well also just web convention.
---
Smaller packages are on the left.
---
Regardless of repeat users.
---
&gt; It's not players responsibility to fix this it's ccp's.
---
But it IS the player's responsibility to nerdrage and unsub when the slightest thing inconveniences them even when it is a change to make the game healthier.
---
Shit post is real. Can we please get this deleted?
---
&gt; If it breaks when you play it, the design is shitty.
---
Except we want a sandbox.
---
There isn't really a way to make a sandbox game that isn't particularly broken without providing a heavy set of restrictions. Which is what EVE players don't want.
---
Make sure you comment about it on the official thread on the forum. That's where they check, I had the same complaint, I don't want to reorganize my screen again. No local really cleared up screen space. Then the big local really messed me up.
---
Little known fact... Walter has a brother named Gordon Freeman. Gordon works at Black Mesa, but no one knows what he does there... Or why he and many others never came home that day.
---
Linking the image.
---
YOUR MY BOY BLUE!!!
---
1. Why was this changed? Could it be that people barely lived in that space and it was changed for content? And how long ago was that ago? A decade or so? Cant really use that as grounds for not having something today.
---
2. Ye lets not pretend you couldnt warp straight to a POS and no fking sabre would magically be in place. Sabres didnt teleport into position before or am I missing something? Also there were no restrictions on the amount of POSs outside of moons right? So this entire premise is kinda shit. Fact is POSs were instasafes which citadels are not for carriers/supers for instance. And defensive options? Come on, they are kinda shit outside of the bigger ones and a keepstar DD, how many times have you even seen one fired, cause I havent seen it too many times. Everyone keeps talking like theyre all manned all the time and just instawape everything in sight. Thats BS. And POSs had/have weaponry that automatically engages right?
---
3. The game is 17 years old dude, that shit was gonna happen sooner or later. Dont put words in my mouth, I have never ever said Rorqs are fine. Im one of the few people that always mentions Rorqs need fixing in every "what needs to be fixed in Eve suggestions". Rorqs are imo the main thing wrong with the current Eve, I sincerely believe if we remove excavators and/or put a vicinity blocker on the indy core (cant siege another within 1000km or so) will fix so many of our other problems.
---
But most believe everything else is the problem so they sit there and complain about tether mechanics (even tho POSs were more OP), income nerfs to NS (even tho there wouldnt be people in that space to hunt if there wasnt a reasonable reward which it really isnt anymore outside of a few select ships), blackout (dumbest shit ever), umbrellas (uhh supers are too OP), cynos (uhh the slowest and most expensive ships have a jump drive which theyve always had) and so on.
---
If you nerf too much, people will just leave. Thats just how it works dude. Nobody is forcing anyone to play this game (I think). And just constantly nerfing shit makes people want to leave because guess what, sometimes people want good news and not a constant stream of bad ones. Thats how people work.
---
And plenty of people in NS dont Rorq mine, I would say the majority even. So why the fk would you burn everyone else because of that stupidly broken ship? Instead of just fixing that one fking ship?
---
TL:DR Fix the fking Rorq and you will get a chain reaction, 1. umbrellas wont be needed in the same sense, 2. more killable ships in space which is much better content than the Rorq (imo we should get a new capital barge that mines less than the current Rorq but has no defenses outside of the regular ones, mainly EHP, so that blops can actually become viable again) and bla bla bla.
---
But dont just neuter everything else simply because of 1 broken ship because you kill the will for players to play the game.
---
i fucken lold take my upvote you magnificent bastard
---
Finally.
---
I kinda like it. I don't think it is that big of a deal even if you don't like it tbh.
---
I hope they will form their own thing in nullsec once they learned the game and not join the blue donut of test
---
nice scam
---
cloaky campers are literally smallest issue or even no issue at all in this game.
---
stop being bad
---
Oh, i read there was a bounty system implemented in 2017, but there were some serious complaints about how it was done. Maybe they removed it? What a shame.
---
everything you think you can take (and sometimes things you cant )
---
What is your pimped thorax fit? I'm used an OK thorax for L2 missions but I thought I needed to upgrade for L3
---
PANIC was a mistake. Change my mind.
---
It's not removed you just won't get rewarded for bounty hunting really
---
Maybe keep them to remember him?
---
&gt; CCP shouldn't have sold their company to a shit Korean company
---
Well, tough luck. Can't turn back time. And can't ignore the laws. So you'll have to live with this crap until you force your government to change the silly law or until PA sells off CCP to someone else.
---
Yeah it is quite hard to see at the end there - it's easier to see how the fleet was split in the first part of the vid.  You can probably tell a bit better from the neut graphics (I think it's the white-ish one), how many Augs were on something in the BS fight...
---
Due to potential for exploitation the bounty system pays out a maximum of 10% of the value of the destroyed ship (minus drops, so only from what was actually destroyed in the loss.) This means that looting the wrecks of the people you kill is going to be a lot more lucrative than the bounties themselves.
---
I would significantly agree with you.
---
But they also can't go so hard that everyone quits before they get it right.
---
WTF, there's shit in this game I haven't run for?
---
Interesting opinion, but, no? I started playing when i was under 18. And many others including alliance leaders have done the same.
---
Or better yet, have tabs vertically instead of horizontally
---
Ehm, no, but thanks.
---
This was kind of a meta joke apparently you missed.
---
Did you log in to EVE today?
---
Certain highsec dwellers will pay you to suicinde gank people they don't like. I'd say, ganking is the closest to bountiy hunting you can get. Plus, the loot can be pretty nice.
---
It's not totally bullshit, but the timer is to long and if you not bring like 100 Bombers or 20 Leshaks or so, it doesn't even need to panic as the tank is insane. Fun Fact: the Tank Bonus of the Industrial Core is higher than the tank bonus of the Triage Module.
---
Not yet no.
---
Well, you'll see soon enough.
---
The game now has a age warning splash screen.
---
Lol, yeah okay, missed that joke then.
---
It's possible to fit a dual rep Ikitursa that is cap stable with a MWD and a stack of small neut. Cap stable with every single module running I mean. It ain't cheap, but if the fight goes long that beast can spool up to 1000+DPS.
---
&gt; Bear in mind CCP aren't listening to us when it comes to changes. 
---
Fixed that for you.
---
You are forced to ball up in large groups (not everybody likes to play in anonymous lemming hordes) to even contest 1 Rorqual. So maybe 100 pilots in Bombers are necessary to put a single pilot in a Rorq at risk. Sounds like good balance to me. And even the 100 Bombers get fucked when he PANICs and has a cyno ready ...
---
just fly a maurauder, you’ll be fine(tm)
---
order of drone hp has also swapped. 
---
coincidence? i think not
---
This is bad and you should feel bad.
---
Lul, economic arguments. You dont know what inflation means. Cause according to CCPs internal numbers (check the MER, any of them) weve had deflation and a somewhat steady rate in the past 6 years. 
---
Dont fking use PLEX as a indicator for inflation, thats what sunday economists do. No one with actual knowledge of economy would use a sole indicator for inflation, thats literally the first thing you learn.
---
So today you learned something new, Im happy to have been part of your learning experience:)
---
Confused me ar first, that's what I get for skipping patch notes, should always read them all even if you think you know what's coming!
---
completely AFKable and scalable until you run out of CPU time
---
lets see ...
---
2016 before Citadels/Injectors/Rorq-Moonmining: Saturday prime Logins at 60.000 without hundreds of Multibox-Miners and SP-Farms
---
2019 BEFORE blackout: Saturday prime Logins 30.000 including large bulks of ISBoxed multibox-mining-setups 
---
Inflation rate of ISK since PLEX introduction: 600 %
---
All looking totally healthy ....
---
miners died easily to my rifter back in '09. oh how the times  have changed.
---
OMF. Big F to that! o7
---
&gt; Where are you that cloaking hurt you so much?
---
The main issue is disparity of effort.
---
Cloaks allow someone complete safety in space with no interactions, at the cost of "not being able to do anything" besides collect all the information they want. Information is a pretty important resource and having an information advantage over the other side is extremely powerful.
---
&gt; even if I was limited to carrying 2 hours of Cloak Cream™️, that’s going to make zero difference
---
It would make a good bit of difference, because someone who AFK cloaks would have to log off while they are at work or sleeping, otherwise they decloak after 2 hours and can be probed down and killed. Even if they are at keyboard, they would either have to jump back to their staging in order to fill up on cloak cream, store the stuff in a can (scannable), or log in a hauler alt with cream/move a hauler into system. All of these activities would add some semblance of risk to 23/7 surveillance.
---
Sorry for your loss but are you sure you won't regret giving these personal art pieces away to some random?
---
Thanks, man. Regarding #1, I was under the impression that the grid holding the acceleration gate could NOT have a cyno lit on it. Am I incorrect? I know this is true for many combat sites. Are DED sites an exception?
---
if my math checks out, that gang only did ~400dps...
---
We’ll be coming down the road! 
---
13.00 sit at the bar
---
00.00 leave the bar
---
Yes but why is shield last?
---
Mind sharing the killmail?
---
it was once possible but then CCP changed the mechanic for worse and bounty hunting became a thing of the past.
---
another dead niche playstyle
---
I'd love the art myself, but this is the right response.
---
The Energy Nosferatu has a skull icon, I'm not sure that's a no-go in China. CCP probably censored it because of that.
---
Also, fuck the Chinese government.
---
Not until instant local gets addressed
---
Hey, I'm mostly full of good ideas!
---
But yup, if they lose it (lets face it, most newbros will easily lose 800m because they'll spend it all on a super great battleship they can barely fly and don't know how to fit) they'll be like "Wow, 800m lost in an instant....how long will it take to get it back?.....100000 hours?!?!??!? this is bullshit!"
---
&gt;OK lets trade dotlan/camping for local?
---
Removing both would be pretty interesting. Zkillboard too perhaps, that shows a ton of PvP data that you wouldn't know otherwise, but people are too attached at this point. 
---
&gt;I have 45 afk campers. 
---
&gt;I don't like AFK playstyles 
---
45 accounts suggest otherwise. Your money though, you do you. That's not a way I would ever play the game. I don't AFK rat or mine or camp, I prefer being awake when I play.
---
&gt;Managing that many accounts is excruciating. It just happens to be the only way to counter your instant free intel.
---
It's the same intel you benefit from by cloaky camping? You get to see who's in system, check killboards, pick targets.  But who are we kidding. If every intel method was removed, be it local, Skill, dotlan, etc. People would still cry that there was a WhatsApp/Discord somewhere with hostiles being pinged/ gatecamps everywhere.
---
No.  If you want to pve, go to null sec.  I hear they have farmville there.
---
&gt; You say that like that's not the single greatest advantage in the game or in fact in any game.
---
Hardly. It still requires the enemy giving a beneficial opportunity.
---
Just because you get to choose when to engage doesn't guarantee any good opportunity will arise.
---
WHat's next my alt has to wear a headscarf because of saudi arabian localization? the fuck out of here.
---
but look on the bright side, they changed the drone damage window...no?
---
That's fine. The joke entertained me.
---
I mean you could always grab the models and print them through thingiverse.
---
&gt; It still requires the enemy giving a beneficial opportunity.
---
Whenever a crab has to be in space to make money, that's the opportunity. The crab is in a ship with inferior combat capability, you can take as long as you want to organize 100 bombers on a blops, you can have as long as you want to observe the crab and plan around their behavior and actions. The crab can take no active actions against you until you decide to take active actions against them, giving you complete initiative.
---
This one is "The Iron Tide" that was created by an EVE player years ago. 
---
CCP (Creaters of EVE) loved it so much that they put it in store for a while. I loved it so much I bought one and hung it up on my wall.
---
Anyways, sorry for your loss.
---
Better set it up on r/MemeEconomy/
---
Just because you do not like my idea doesn't proof me wrong.
---
LowSec needs something to make it worthwhile. Either more security or more rewards.
---
I mean... why now, when EVE already failed in China?
---
That´s not fully correct. NPCs prioritize ships that are the closest to their own size, tending to attack one that is larger than smaller then temselves. Also they tend to switch the longer they were shooting at the same target. So when you warp with your Cruiser into a site where the NPCs are attacking a Battleship, it´s very likely that the NPC Frigattes will switch to the Cruiser, as it´s a more fitting target for them
---
&gt;Epic
---
no
---
Its probably for the Korean localization, as they have protection laws like that aswell afaik. For example, the whole blue blood thing in some shooter games
---
You're doing it wrong
---
How will this make it more mobile friendly....  What ever happened to HTFU?
---
yeah but also like rl if your makeing mistakes you can loose money real fast.
---
I work have wife and kid and not so much free time. So when I log in I want some quick pvp... Everything in game is so fucking expensive. I pay sub its ok but if you lose t3d or bs in yolo action thats 500to 1 bil ISK. Dont tell me you can pvp in t1 frigate cuz i find that boring. Pi is time consuming clickfest and you need to haul your goods to Jita , DED sites are boring akf ratting is boring basically any pve action is boring and you making yourself target for hunters . I have no tried incursions but every kind of pve or money grind is boring as f.... . I like eve but i hate to grind so I stopped until some better times. R64 mining pays well but its boring as hell, active pvp require lots of ISK and I dont want to pay to grind or pay to not play ( waiting for skills to train etc.)
---
&gt;No shit. And you can tell when the camper is active by taking 2 seconds to look them up on zkill to find their timezone. If it's their timezone either A) choose another system, B) set up bait and counter drop them, C)
---
Finding their timezone lmao. Also you must only ever have solo players drop on you if you think bait someone who drops a fleet when they do drop.
---
&gt;C) accept that goku don't get to krab in perfect safety you fucking pansy.
---
I don't know what you mean by Goku, but how am I the pansy when you're the cloaked coward who doesn't want his afk button to be less afk? I'm not talking about hunting, I'm talking about being able to hide forever.
---
&gt;Oh but I do so enjoy calling you out for being the cancer that is killing Eve. How could I resist?
---
 
---
Disliking afk gameplay is killing eve? Your stupidity is breathtaking. Tell you what, why don't you just go AFK on Reddit instead of in game?
---
&gt; I would even say that there is in fact more PvP happening in HighSec at any given day than in LowSec.
---
I would even say that there is in fact more PvP happening in HighSec at any given day than literally any other area of space, and there's still more PvP happening in ls than ns judging by the top regions.

Dear CCP,

Localization is cool.  However, you can make it actually local to Korea and not the rest of the planet please.
---
Ingame they still have skulls.
---
The image server has been having issues for a while already (big changes for it https://developers.eveonline.com/blog/article/from-image-server-to-a-whole-new-image-service-1)
---
Maybe something got mixed up and the imageserver is serving china assets instead of TQ assets?  
---
Though BR doen't return the sencored china logo https://images.evetech.net/corporations/500012/logo. Maybe only items have this problem.
---
believe it or not a lot of people did. New player feedback identified it as an area new players had trouble with since it goes left to right here, and right to left there. CCP picked one and made it match the other.

Actually no it didnt. The Blackout was never a full time change. What sped up the end of Blackout wasnt complaints from die hards with years ingame it was to massive drop in daily player count which was going to kill the game befire the end of the year if left inplace.
---
Nope, besides the ability to jump and the tank (if you have good sec), the marshal is pretty mediocre.

Not complaining about anything.

This IS the cost of Pi. These ARE the ratios. This is the amount of resources that goes into the production chain.
---
ok

popcorn interaction intensifies
---
This is what I'm asking about so thanks for giving an answer.
---
But now how to consider what are reasonable production rates? 
---
All the factory setups I can find barely fuel 3 p4 factories. Usually because of some bias to control at least some of the p1-&gt;p3 input chain. 
---
Secondarily because of a need to import efficiently and that eats up a lot of cpu for a colony in Launch Pads.

Always gotta upvote a fellow loyalist (or maybe heretic, or even xenos, I don't discriminate). Yes, that would be utterly atrocious if the Chinese censorship got hold of 40k :(

I wonder what they are going to do with boosters, freedom fighters, and militants considering Chinese localization.

This has to be a troll. No one is actually this thick.
---
Just ask him
---
You could spend the first 2-3 months without it, but after that you will want it.

Imagine walking around all the time with a fully automatic shotgun, getting into a fight with a dude armed with a 9mm pistol and him asking you to put the shotgun down and get your 9mm.

prime example of spodbrain...

Theta dont jump in anything smaller them a supercarrier. But yes a similar thing happened to a guy doing abyssals Yesterday, and also to me.
---
Well i got angry and just fed a dread and some other ships too but well such is life
---
Yep sadly you are correct
---
Buy high, sell low.
---
You got any pictures ? And where are you located ?
---
I wasn't the one that died idiot, I think it's retarded that the Stratios can jump in through a cyno when it's a very low skill/cheap ship after they made only specialized ships be able to use the cyno I think they should work on the ships that can go through it damn it

Offensive in China.

Tiananmen Square Waifu hasn't either

ha, 4 and 9 (pronounced the same than death and suffering) in japanese. Thanks wikipedia

I did not know about 888, good to know (I guess, I'm sure I'll find use of that one day)

Tethered pods on gates can only gather information on the gate grid. Once you are off the gate grid the things do nothing.

Instant Item Delievery to any station or cargo hold of your choice on any of 3 characters in the game.

Its OP as fuck, and I keep everything in my redeem system as long as possible.
---
Why do Bombers fit Laserpointers?
---
I get fleet doctrins where those Targetpainters are usefull on a 100man Bomberfleet... but solo their application is so fcking useless.

and \~300 dps.  bring friends :)

reading is hard

They were previously rewards and drops during seasonal events. I don’t think there is a supply outside of that.

The best advice I can give you is start up and play around with a your ship for a week and then get involved with a solid null sec group. My recommendation is Horde. They literally accept anyone and run classes, newbean welcome packages, friendly roams. They have it all for you. I've been playing the game for a very long time and have a decent amount of isk but regularly fly a 50 mil ship.
---
The best thing you cold do is spend $20 in real life money and buy some plex and get like a Billion + in isk and just fly cheap stuff all you want. That will last you for a very long time.
---
Lol
---
id love it to be with colors
---
may look shitty but its so nice to navigate
---
Make a dual-fit PVE/PVP Astero, explore and hack outside of high sec to make isk, and blap fellow explorers while doing it. You get the best of both worlds, and the Astero is a tanky beast.
---
Odd, my facts say that more and more people want to play.[Absolute proof I am right](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2Ff%2Ff9%2FE12_values_graph.svg%2F1024px-E12_values_graph.svg.png&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1)

Ontario Canada, and I will send a few in a bit!
---
But your modules are on the right so it dose make sense. How about you let me chose the orientation then?
---
What system?
---
In watchlist it makes sense as the name is on the left, in the HUD it makes sense as the modules are on the right. Why not just let me chose it? 
---
And where are these new players you speak of?

Play as alpha for a bit till you learn the game, the game on its own is pretty dull, but the community of ppl you play with on a daily basis in the Corp you end up in, is what makes it fun
