Oh oh oh, it would be a good idea to also add a "did FC said jump" button in fleet panel!
---
---
---
Players can adapt and respond intelligently, don't expect a better reward for less work and risk.
---
With a corresponding "for the love of fuck DO NOT jump. GATE RED GATE RED GATE RED" button
---
now, after watching the last Tennocon stream a while back, this description feels kinda... sad.
---
&gt; What about the ganks where NPCs got final blows?
---

---
there is no such thing as npc's getting final blows on km generation, try to find a km with a final blow done by a npc
---
What do you think is going to change?
---
Taxation is theft. Change my mind.
---
Reddit posting part of me yells at myself this is a bad idea
---
But the freighter pilot part agree with this proposal with both hands up
---

AAR: Very briefly summarized in the video but basically, XIX had an I-hub come out, FRT brought 150 Munnins plus support to contest, Legacy brought 175 Munnins plus support. FRT left to another grid and brought in a handful of capitals. Legacy forced their sub-capital fleet off the grid and took some capitals.
---
Was a fun fight!
---
I have to ask, what is the source of the universe/region maps you're using now? I kinda miss the dotlan ones you used to use, I found them significantly easier to tell what was going on.
---
That said, this is still a quite useful and informative video, and I'm glad you're doing them. I just wish you were using dotlan instead. =P
---
Average linemembers are bad everywhere, it comes down to the percentage of FC's that are not dogshit tbh.   
---
  
---
Compared to goons they're like 1000 times more sympathic. 
---
And last but not least i cant really count them as big when theres 4 blocs with alliances that are much bigger. (Idk where youre getting 4th from btw, together theyd be 6th. Even if you counted associates in theyd be 5th. Also mercenaries is nowhere near top 10 so me thinks you might have confused them with associates. Associates are renters btw)  
---
I was comparing them on a nullbloc level so i guess thats where the confusion came from.
---
"Interesting that 2017 had 25% more kills in nullsec than 2018 though,  makes the July 2017 to 2019 comparison a lot stronger for the July 2019  one."
---
I do not think it does. Nullsec affects the other Secs more than they affect Null, but things do not happen in isolation.  So when I did the ISK destroyed.  I crossed reference Kills vs ISK destroyed. Alot of the regions from high, low, and null that had more kills in 2019 had lower ISK Destroyed in 2019.  So either people are being cheap in 2019 or maybe more structure deaths in 2018.  I would like to know if reason 2018 null kills were down but overall higher was it due to NullSec playing in other secs.
---
They have loads of data but nobody knows how to run a query.... ;)
---
Goons are some serious /r/leopardsatemyface material right now.
---
And this overview size/tab...lulz xd.
---
Me caring about the 3^rd post of today talking about winning a fight be like:
---
.
---
Bring back 2013 warp speeds
---
I'm wondering if it's possible to translate this into something that's using lasers?  I'm trying, but I'm having some PG issues that an implant can't solve and I don't want to lose the lows.
---
That’s all I could find
---
Ships are slow on purpose. The faster you can travel between destinations in any game, the smaller the world begins to feel. That's why a lot of MMOs feel really expansive at first. Then after you get a mount, or a flying mount, or the ability to teleport, the world feels small and boring. You no longer worry about surviving the trip from one city to another when you can teleport across dimensions.
---
If they make all the ships warp faster, it's just going to make everything that much more boring. And this game could really do with less boring, not more.
---
yeah I'm really sure lots of new players are quitting over NPC taxes lmao.
---
Maybe, idk/tbh, but seems like people who do not have assets at risk are crying out for structure deaths to work exactly like ship deaths.  Which would be material destruction and RNG based transfer of material/wealth.   CCP stating more or less NullSec is to blame for the current state of the game.  That its too is too much material/ISK getting put into the game by them.
---
When did Skill Yourself took fights they couldn't win? In which world is that risk?
---
Just look at that overview. Disgusting.
---
Clearly you've never gone more than 5 jumps in a battleship friend.  Long story short, its fucking cancer.
---
Look for where the level4 agents of popular mission corps are at, like SOE.
---
Not to downplay your point, but you'd be surprised how little difference any individual (even large) war actually makes in aggregates of the whole of New Eden. It's one of the reasons you need to be careful when using kill counts as evidence in either direction.
---
I too played 5 years ago for about a month. Didnt stixk with it.
---
Hopped into a FW corp this time around and I'm having a blast. The faction warfare complex mechanics let you earn isk(through LP) while actively searching for pvp. The other nice part about the complexes is they have ship limits. Only  frigates can enter a novice. You can still get out shipped and ganged up on but it's the closest thing to a level playing field you'll find in eve I think.
---
Not if he's got enough neuts that are properly staggered it wont.
---
I was actually thinking about this watching a stream the other day. Not a bad idea
---
Yeah you're right, he's wrong. Small nos only works if the curse is horrible and doesn't stagger neuts.
---
Clearly. Never in the 11 years or so that I've been playing Eve, have I ever flown anything big and clunky. Not my Battleships, not my Orca, not my Providence. Nope, never ever.
---
Cancer rots away at you from the inside, slowly making you worthless and hopeless. Most of these "Hey Reddit, I've got a good idea"s are Eve cancer. Kinda like when someone said "wouldn't it be cool if we could buy PLEX" or "what if we could buy Skill Injectors"...
---
5 possible values to the power of 4 attributes is 625 possible combinations.
---
Quit Eve. Asking CCP to make anything easier is why this game.is shit to begin with.
---
Welcome 2 grath
---
Look into hyperspacial rigs if traveling is important, I have a few intercepters around HS with i-stabs and hyperspacial rigs, makes getting around and through low-sec easy.
---
no, factoring in warp speeds is a determining factor for taking certain fights. meaning can I gank this dude before his friends can help him.
---
&gt; Average linemembers are bad everywhere, it comes down to the percentage of FC's that are not dogshit tbh. 
---
not really? there are several entities whose line members aren't bad, not saying they're amazing necessarily but they can be relied upon to do certain things that init linebois in average couldn't in a million years do on their own. If they could rely on their members stuff like attendance wouldn't need to be tracked, nor fucking drama taxes.
---
Yeah you're right, not sure why i got IA confused with IM. But with that if you get them together you have the 7th biggest alliance in the game, and if we take out renters and whatever the fuck silent company is they go to 5th. I mean this is gonna be a discussion on semantics anyway so its not like it'll end, but the cutoff from being a big alliance not even going past the top 10 in size in the game seems a bit weird
---
It took me ages to figure out how to seperate them.
---
It would make a fantastic thread
---
Never a miscommunication.
---
Yeah that's what we might end up doing. As you said it might be a good way to PvP as a duo as we probably won't be looking to join a corp for now. Maybe we'll start the Sisters of Eve arc then follow-up with FW.
---
How do we start FW? Any advice or guide you recommend?
---
I've come to think of Eve as more of a giant board game than an active mmo. If you are logged on you get to take turns. More turns = more stuff done. But you can still have plenty of fun with limited turns.
---
I play an hour or two...or 3 a few nights a week. Some weekend nights much more.
---
Tonight I logged in, transported 8 new fits I want to try from Jita to my home system. Almost died to a gate camp. Did some small gang pvp with the Corp. They went to go defend a citadel but I was planning on bed soon so I stuck around in system. Managed to get 2 solo kills in a FW plex.
---
this is why people smoke weed together
---
Talking about the fact that they disbanded due to the direction the game was going in at the time (big bloc turbo krabbing). The risk reward we are specifically talking about here is the fact that some of the most lucrative PVE in the game is extremely safe.
---
For the hour after landing and the hour before landing. Between you can sneak a puff in the bathroom on a vape pen or something.
---
You can just chew nicotine gum on a plane though.
---
They were independent. Every alliance goes through bad points in their history where in order to survive they need to crash on the couch of one of their friends until they can get back on their feet. It doesn't remove their independence, they did not joined Legacy as a member, they were a guest of Legacy until Legacy helped them secure space for themselves.
---
Does working with a more powerful friend removes one independence, if such, every non Panfam alliance that actively works with Panfam is not independent by that twisted definition.
---
&gt; Something like a C2-C3/HS could maybe serve you pretty well
---
Problem with that is there are 105 wormholes with that kind of profile, and they're all occupied. My friends and I are in a similar situation as OP's (except I'm the newbro in this case) and we're looking too, but chances are we're gonna have to evict somebody.
---
Just shut the fuck up. Nobody wants to hear your pretentious ass condescending drivel.
---
We killed 3 carriers there yesterday. Maybe you're hunting outside of their TZ?
---
RvB seems alright. I've fought them a few times. They are FW now. I might end up checking them out after my time in E-Uni.
---
Heh.  Just tried this in a destroyer.  Insta-melt.
---
I could get behind bumping all ships up 1 au/s.
---
They've generated killmails since they were put into the game for Excavators. Fighters generated killmails since the Carrier rework of 2016.
---
Strong move
---
Guessing English isn't your native tongue? Or the wormhole life either?
---
The fastest warp speed is a cyno.
---
That makes sense - even if you just did it with one alt account, you could have 3 toons on that account all able to request lvl 5s and give yourself a decline per hour.  Solid.
---
Don't ferget to let 'em know there might be a shipping tax on the train set
---
PL/NC and many other groups to do that same. I imagine yours do as well.
---
Yeah I'd be down for local in npc space
---
I made that post after o3-...?   
---
You are so badly informed lol
---
I just want FW space to be cyno inhib and gangs of diamond empire NPCs to bust gatecamps
---
Makes sense aswell honestly, same thing with the trailer where they switched a ship for something better looking. It really matters when you're trying to advertise something
---
Also CCP not understanding the definition of the word 'exploration'.
---
Ehhh, i know theres groups with slightly competent members but how many of them A live in null and B are part of a bloc? I can't think of many.
---
And the problem with size is that mindless mass recruiting blew a few alliances just completely out of proportion. 
---
If Init is big, what are goons, test or horde?
---
Upvote for good question.
---
If everything that can fit a cyno isn’t engageable, literally nothing other than maybe interceptors is engagable
---
I have no idea who would be open but poke around people like MCAV, Scary Wormhole People, Inner Hell I also think. Maybe they'll refer you to someone else if they can't help.
---
Just wing it. Generate your own content by being in people's faces :D (just not obnoxiously so)
---
Agreed. I flew with Goons. It’s horrible.
---
No matter how hard you cry it's not going to make local come back. I'd suggest you find a healthy hobby.
---
*cough cough* /moveme =)
---
new qfc alliance might be coming in... more targets for the good guys :)
---
Wheres the goons that "happen" to be in the are on a stratop?
---
Biomass irl for this post
---
Be the carrier pilot for a small lowsec group. You will lose your carrier, but if you can afford it, you'll feel like a badass
---
I wonder if this region will be filled with goon bots in an alt alliance like period basis?
---
So you believe it’s not ccp job to make their game unwelcome to botting?   That the community should enforce the EULA?
---
Serious question.
---
Why were you taking photos in my room???
---
I hear that but my point was more a reference to the 4 areas - HS/LS/NS/WH
---
Local in NPC space but not sov null would be very interesting indeed!
---
&gt; fuck this, I pay enough taxes IRL
---
I hear enough whining about taxes IRL. People who want to not pay any taxes should move to Somalia if that's what's important to them.
---
This TBH
---
I dont give a fuck about if we disagree about everything IRL, those red guys on the overview have gots to die.
---
Sorry, my side of the room was messy...
---
Pleasure room https://imgur.com/a/82i9rye
---
I am? I was there. I know when the post went up. I know when you lost the IAS fort timer because you stayed docked in 08 for 2 hours.
---
The bitching about guns being split was a result of the fight on the way to IAS where you crashed like 3 times and had nothing better to do than complain. The post went up right after the fleet stood down.
---
I can post the BR from that fight and a screenshot of the forum thread if you would like to double down and claim I'm the one whose uninformed.
---
The one difference there is titan kills, since they spike so suddenly in B-R/UALX type battles that they naturally eclipse titan kills around the galaxy
---
So now you understand why no one wants to come to Goon space either. Null blocs created a boring ass Eve. Now that it’s been shaken a bit you’re crying. Own your shit.
---
yeah no speaking as a former init director (aka completely unimportant low level management)a big chunk of INIT's actual command team has been pushing for this for years. To name names who have been in favor inclined towards or threw literal fits in an attempt to force it there are INITs top two fcs, their former head diplomat, the guy who ran their ustzs diplomacy and corp recruitment, several of their second teir of fcs, some of the poor sons of bitches who got dragged into rental management, and Bliss himself was looking for a way to make it work. 
---
Goons not wanting it at first is part of why init kept it so long.
---
It's as simple as talking to an NPC and joining. I think it will help you find the agent within the agency window.
---
Game is more fun in a corp. Even more so considering there are corps that are exclusively FW. It's nice having backup and vets with bigger ships. Solo PVP is fun but if that's all I limited myself to I would have to run from too many fights during heavy traffic times because of all the small gang pvp.
---
If asset safty goes away it for shure should only be on low power structures , people in a group invest in assests with the understanding they can take care of RL and the assets are there when they get back. The advantage of playing with friends. They watch your back.
---
I'm betting heavily on sebulba. Scaling of asset safety, the higher the value the higher cost bracket to retrieve to counteract titans in stations moving risk free.
---
It hurts
---
&gt; Literally everyone I've talked to in nullsec likes the blackout
---
Must be the Forum Warrior Vocal Minority saying the opposite then; interesting (and probably good) that on your side in the field you're seeing a lot more actual support than the initial wave of salt backlash
---
We checked with all of CCP's recorded history and determined that this was a lie.
---
No for real though. They haven't spent all that money on improving Eve. Not even close.
---
loled from this. Ahahaha
---
"I'm playing the game guys. Yeaaaaa!"
---
Thank you. I love that eve is about number crunching sometimes
---
Heya Dato, good to see you’re still around!
---
Didn’t even realise who OP was until I checked the killmail
---
[Just wanted to be loved...](https://i.imgur.com/tgwjbh4.gif)
---
You could like set some timers with a similarly sized group or roll from a nullsec static if you want content. Have you considered that maybe the issue is the alliance you're in, not the game?
---
At the end of the day your group has endless diplomatic agreements favouring farming at the expense of PVP content, being forced to idly travel around in the hopes someone fights you for the sake of fighting you is the result of your alliances rules rather than the games rules.
---
How about a volume CAP in citadels?
---
Let's embrace the structure spam!
---
Was thinking about suggesting this, but probably better for the diplo to do it.
---
Glad to see INIT. is finally dropping Querious; Good move, way overdue. 
---
Hilarious to see INIT. charging their member corps 20m per main per month now.
---
    "* All corporations will be asked to make a minimal contribution per month towards basic costs such as sov, fuel bills etc. Amount owed will be equivalent of #number of mains per corp x 20m ISK. Payment cycle will be monthly in advance receivable from member corps starting August 1st. "
---
LOL surprise surprise   suitonia trying to defend the blackout that is clearly killing the game xD
---
Providence,which isn't Goon Horde/Legion Please Ignore, was at first, but now its dried out.   Its pretty much just the Provibloc vs TRC/HTP/Phew insurgency.  Its made the war a stalemate again.  Less roams coming in and such.  There has been uptick of blop/bombers but doesn't match number of roams nor are they counterable as roams.  Sev3rance lost most of our PvEers not sure if they just stop log-in, went to join the likes of Goon Horde/Legion Please Ignore, or refugee in Empire.  Need to see if I can get ESI data I been told I can get, mostly to manage alliance finances since I have Econ background, to see if they're just not logging in or left.
---
Ah I see, thanks for clarifying
---
everything is a reskin xD
---
Personally I think it’s warp deceleration that is a problem. Ships slow down too slowly when coming out of warp, but I heard it’s a technical problem with the code and thy can’t make it faster. There’s like 10 steps of slowdown where you only go a fraction of an AU.
---
Rorqs only deal &gt;1k dps
---
I think you are thoroughly uninformed the only people I'm not allowed to shoot are the people in the Imperium or our renters, I can shoot at literally everyone else. Insofar as bashing structures to create timers for a fight absolutely thats something I can do and do do but that inevitably leads to them batphoning and it not being fun or engaging more often than not. I mean who enjoys structure bashing cmon now.
---
The alliance I am in absolutely does not stop me from doing my own levels of PVP they actively encourage it friendo
---
Rolling from a nullsec static makes literally zero change from rolling in through the gates post blackout how the hell do you think that would differ? If i get into a system where something is active im pretty certain it would be the same as everywhere else now it would be cyno up roam over.
---
For real rather than trying to tell me what my own alliance (that I'm part of, that I FC for, that Im a CEO of a corp in and a squad leader for) diplomatic policies and rules of engagement are, maybe try to consider that my concerns might be legitimate
---
Just go farm your 10b/hr for a week retard
---
More JPG please
---
It's the same with all those food advertisements too, pancake stack doesn't look fluffy enough? Stick some cardboard between them.
---
&gt;  /u/Lorenzo_Maulerant is an FC; a content creator for Goons
---
am i missing a joke here? or has the bar fallen this low?
---
Are you brain dead? At what point did I say anything about coming to goon space. We all knew that was retarded in the first place my whole concern with the blackout is it means theres fuck all but that now. You dense fuck
---
Ok but you're the one here who can't find content 😁
---
Ahh, I see you are a person who doesn't research at all. This is hilarious.  Have a nice day kid, you obviously have no clue.
---
Fortunately no one gives a shit what you care about
---
You say it like its news to me
---
I don’t give a shit about what I even care about
---
What is this, Monster Hunter?
---
The real EVE endgame
---
Oh right. Goons will go fucking drop on anyone, but if you come to their space you’re an asshole. Drop your balls little boy. Sorry no one likes Goons, and they don’t want to play by YOUR arbitrary rules.
---
Yes please. If the game was packed I'd disagree but atm you need to fly so far to find someone I think shorter travel times would be good.
---
Try the Stanford Prison Experiment. Just make sure to take the blue pill.
---
Fucking min/maxers.
---
Be nice if there was neutral organization in New Eden that could analyze whats happening across the board and see if its working out.
---
Mate. I'm not saying they are cunts for protecting their own... I'm not saying there has to be any rules.... I'm bluntly stating that the blackout has meant that people have turtled up and now that is the only content. Ot has cut down what was there to the tedious part that we both agree on being tedious.
---
Now if you can pull your head out of your ass and stop trying to grab that grr gon karma or whatever and want to discuss it like grown ass adults rather than strawmanning me then sure lets go.
---
No, Space Detroit is in Tama.
---
You picked the side with the most blues cause you are weak. Now you are suffering from content stagnation while others are having fun. Sorry mate as your kind have said to me the past years,  adapt or quit.
---
/me looks at 7yw pocket in provi. Not a bot, sure...
---
And fix deceleration at the same time, might actually bother to undock in something bigger than a frigate for the first time since around 2013.
---
The blues arent an issue, jesus you fuckers are crawling out the woodwork in the last half hour.
---
The only people I cant shoot are people who are in my coalition who share the same space as me. Im not sure why this is so hard a concept to grasp.
---
I would say 3% is within the margin of error
---
who tf would rent querious, they can't even find people willing to live there for free
---
It's taken from the dotlan stats page. No other info than shown.
---
Probably the proteus if the pilot isn't a potato.
---
Sure it’s their job.
---
But you’re just upset they took away your afk isk printer. I’m going to love it for brawing on holes when I get back.
---
i can get behind this
---
Welcome to being a Cheeta.
---
There are wars active, just not so big in scale. Pushes are either much slower, or completely uncontested. Content denial, timezone tanking are the most used defence tactics. 
---
As for nullsec home defence, it's much less frequent now, at least for me. Rorqs aren't atacked so often now, instead Excav bombing is at all time high. They are either using T2 Mining Drones, or don't mine at all.
---
Subcap ratting is great reduced, it's harder to find stray Domis or Myrms now. On the other hand, everyone that could afford, already switched to supers. And they are now fitted for full tank now. No more hyperspatial hels.
---
Overall, I wouldn't call this good for the game. I'm having fun bombing excavs and doing cloaky stuff, and I recommend that for more people. It's satisfying if it works, and it's still fun even if it doesn't. But I wouldn't call this sustainable at all.
---
In the wizard hat
---
leopard ftw
---
You know, if they did post good fits, that *somebody* would bitch about it being an unfair advantage to someone else.
---
I could probably ping some folks to get a fight if I'm online. See you in space o7
---
Iceborne approacheth my dude
---
If you check eve who your alliance only has 34k ppl add your coalition members also and you realize that thats alot of wasted potential targets. Dude rly if you love pvp just drop Goons n join a small corp. You will ty me after 3 months.
---
Someone please teach the Chinese to be able to make English Propaganda :(
---
No doubt, but for 15-30 USD, I expect something more like Shakim Warlord or Imperial Jubilee, not this 4:30pm on a Friday stuff :P
---
Theres more to the game and being in an alliance than just pvp though right? Theres a community, theres friendships, theres the oppurtunity to do every part of the game from within goons. The only issue i promise you is the same issue I would have outside of goons and that is that everyones turtled up under the umbrella therefore less smaller fleet subcap fights to be had only supers being dropped on my head and then on top of that if I ditched goons i'd be down on the community and everything else that entails. Pre blackout the good targets for a good fun brawl were in the space that is now deserted now its just a helldunk or blueballs mentality and it honestly surprises me that you guys are so up for that.
---
Yes for battleships and below, no for cap and supers.
---
All my gaming sessions are full with content. Your problem is a combination of the large amount of blues you have plus terribad inexperienced tacklers and not goin less than 10 man.
---
Massively underated comment
---
AU increase would be great for escaping fights. No wonder it's purposed.
---
&gt;If its empty it’d be nice if a new group could move in. 
---
So I can farm them everyday and if they get any delusions of being uppity about not making any isk, I can call in my superbros and let them know why the region is dead and they should join a blob or rent.
---
The blackout fixed nullsec guise, we can all go home now.
---
I have missed something - does no one use any type of Battleship anymore? I remember back in 05 and 06 etc they were everywhere
---
It wouldn't be the first time they put a decimal in the wrong spot.
---
Well unfortunately the game will never get better until 2/3 of the players decide they no longer want a giant ratting safe haven. You could start by ditching and it is likely content seekers would follow you if you are fcing fun fleets.
---
Thing is... "capital umbrellas" attract the exact type of player eve was originally staying away from...risk averse theme park carebears. Even goons from 5 years ago would be saddened to see what it is now. Yes youve won eve... congrats...the only thing left is to watch your wallets grow and make up fake challenges and enemies. 
---
I massively cut down on this game when W space mechanics were nerfed in to oblivion and it was no longer viable to maintain a 100+ person corp financially without having bear holes. Thing is... those are the type of pilots (regardless of where they flew) who really made up eve and made it the community it once was. 
---
CCP traded long term finances for short term cash boosts via skill injectors to show an amazing cashflow when they sold.
---
 Unfortunately it murdered their game in the process. Cant blame goons as an entity for doing what they do... but what i can do is blame individuals such as yourself who contribute to the final death blow to this game and complain when CCP has to make last ditch efforts to save you from yourself.
---
You see you're coming from a perspective of "there is and only should be nanogangs" im coming from the "there should be large fleet fights, small fleet fights, small gang fights, nanogang fights and more" perspective. 
---
The goal of even bothering with other groups krabs should be to provoke a reasonable sized response to get a brawl that satisfies everyone from linemember pushing f1 to the FC to the opposing fleet etc. You know as well as I do if you go to any of the blocs and fuck with them they will straight drop supers on you game over no fun had. Pre blackout people were braver in their shit outside of umbrellas and you could agitate them into rushing subcaps over to save em.
---
O hey, I was there
---
So was freeing slaves.
---
aPpEal tO aUthOriTy
---
It like you saw me say don't misrepresent what I want or said and were like no fuck this im going to misrepresent you. Get fucked
---
Warp speed deceleration is intentionally capped for balance reasons
---
The fact you've been downvoted for stating a simple truth that has been true since around 2004 is shocking.
---
Most groups I've been in large or small generally tell people to HTFU about politics. that's not why we're here.
---
you forgot to mention the XiX fleet blobbing once again in a fight lol.....pathetic
---
I don't think he is, no.
---
I earn enough isk by doing exploration and pi with one account.
---
If you play mostly during the week then a different tz Corp will be better. During the weekends we have a lot of different stuff going on pretty much constantly.
---
Please don't bring up painful old memories of CCP's shit dev practices, my old ticker can't take the strain.
---
Most of Null Sec is empty.   If people were going to move in they would have already.  There is too much space.  I think this is part of the reason low sec is empty.  LowSec isnt a good middle ground between High &amp; Null imo.
---
A plated strat can tank all ghost sites anywhere in New Eden.
---
Can explosions in wormhole ghost sites do 12k raw explosive damage. I would really like to see a heron that can tank that.
---
Gettin Reddit blobbed dude. Send reps
---
I unsubbed my X amount of accounts because of the blackout and moved out of null sec. You just cemented my decision to win eve. You are a terrible community manager who only panders to certain groups, and you do not represent the entirety of Eve. I hope Eve dies a firey death that it deserves.
---
Wow!  I thought I was the only one having this problem.  Unable to play the game for past couple days.  "A network error has occurred during authentication yada yada.."
---
Eve account management site gets timed out.
---
Tried everything.  Disabling firewall, using Google DNS, bypassing my router and etc.
---
Contacted CCP support with log and stuff.  Basically, I was told my ISP is the one with the issue.
---
Contacted my ISP, they blame CCP, asked me to check with CCP to see if they "accidentally" blocked certain ISP or IP addresses.
---
I guess this is how I win Eve.
---
hes downvoted because ccp released the recent botting counts in each alliance and frat is like quadruple above the next alliance
---
This legit made me smile today :)
---
I'm guessing that you've never flown a t3c.  Covert Reconfiguration subsystem gives it the same hacking bonus as a strat and it also gets better scanning and cloak bonuses.
---
I don't disagree on that point, but replacing training clones with timed boosters seems like a step back.
---
However, it is probably the best option as I don't see a better way to speed up training without disincentivizing pvp (unless you make the booster permanent, real stupid idea to do that).
---
per module
---
Upset is definitely the wrong emotion.   Disappointed yeah.  The local black out is lazy way to address perceived or real problems.   If they wanted to kill bots I feel like they are able to do that internally
---
you 'hunting' in space you live in isn't the target
---
Man, I should go see if someone's playing Eve in my crawlspace.
---
Nah I like my theory better.  Gonna go with my narrative bruh
---
Indirectly hurts the economy because the high price further encourages krabbing (and does not directly remove isk from the system)
---
*cries in steam player*
---
You won't be able to active tank ghost sites in wormholes and null in a strat unless you're running it blingy with deadspace dual armor reps. Better go for buffer tank with good explosive resists.
---
Yet will post shit about how the southern war is boring and uninteresting
---
Wah cry baby.  Move to drone lands already.
---
I have? Show me
---
He never said anything about levels of bots.
---
It's no fun if you don't have literally half the game as blues and in on your fleet.
---
I just picked up MHW on Steam. Are we not getting the expansion?
---
"independent"
---
just like how test's mouth is independent from the goon dick.
---
Name checks out.
---
Blackout will last till it holds excitement and support of a large player base. Null sec eve should be all about uncertainty and chaos, if you want order and peace where you can farm the AI 'monsters', gather resources and build whatever you want wherever you want then go play Minecraft.
---
ZOOM. OUT.

If you can fit the shit, do Abysses, you can earn billions per hour.
---
Maybe you should unsub the last one as well since you don't seem to be having much fun.
---
Nightmares get used on occasion.
---
But its mostly HAC and BC
---
Before ending the current test wish you guys would consider a timer delay local too.
---
let's also realize that i smartbombed 7000 of my own shuttles in jita in july of 2017 so u can take 7k out from there
---
Wait, how do you regenerate 1350 hps on shields? I have max almost max shield skills with a Large Dead-G Shield Booster and Domination Boost Amplifier and also Tech 2 Shield boosting Rig and only regen 179Hps on Shield. ??
---
and so does learning implants, because cybernetics V, so?

Honestly... I preferred the look and feel of the runner up. Although the second runner up I'm questioning how that got anything considering it looked garbage (a bit like my set up) and there was far better set ups in the contest.
---
you dont need to know them all right away
---
Hey, I lived in 9uy
---
Well yeah but most tutorials for games don't do a very good job of properly teaching you some of the other mechanics
---
well get that bitch into fleet then what are you waiting for
---
rumor has it that vily wants to blue rouge drones
---
You do not know that for sure.
---
sounds like that smaller group of people needs to git gud lmbo
---
And less than five hours after I read this I got blasted by some laserbrain in a Loki. You're a bloody prophet
---
Removal of asset safety will completely kill small.and medium sized alliances. It will also kill the concept of these small groups forward staging against null in remote parts of the regions (like what happened in Spire), they and thier deployment will get headshotted. Big alliances can and will still be able to move shit around in their cit highways spanning several regions.
---
Not alot of people are screaming for it's removal.
---
It also wrecks up your rl stuff. Can make it more expensive and longer to asset safety but removal will throw game totally out of whack.
---
1. If in doubt, right-click.

---
You're being incoherent. There is no "appeal to authority" here. And logical fallacies are not logical fallacies "for a reason," they're fallacies because they reduce to *non sequitur.* Just like your post.
---
Get Fucked
---
my advice is stare at the market until you understand what the numbers mean.  As a fellow noob, searching the market for small things i can sell makes the game enjoyable, i.e. right now the price of Veldspar is better than average so mining that and selling it is a good learning experience
---
I remember living in Molden Health years ago my alliance fighting Feign Disorder tooth and nail for moons.  Fixing LowSec should be more than just fixing FW.
---
You so realize is his flair is accurate, his corp is resident to any form of change and advice is wasted on them because they always know best
---
It doesnt matter he says they are all the same when it's clear they are not. Dont even get me started on how market bots are 10x worse for the game than the ratting bots. Or the bots that farm level 4 missions all day. Or the bot fleets of 50 who run incursions in high sec and make tens of billions of isk a day. Hes getting downvoted cuz hes ignorant as fuck
---
And yet en-pl nyxes were running that whole time and still are.
---
if you have a name or evidence of bots in EN-PL please forward them on.  I think my [killboard](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77109973/) speaks for [itself](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77109971/)
---
Why I thought kills would be useful determining vibrancy.  Cornerstone of what is  blowing stuff up.
---
 (why would you NOT trade there even before the changes is beyond me as well)
---
Because it can be blown up and as TEST have shown, vily lies.
---
You click on what you don't understand, and let history do the rest
---
well that's ambiguous
---
well, "now" is pretty soon when you think about it.
---
its not ccp's fault that we've come to understand "soon" means "in a year or two", right? :P
---
GUYS 2017 STATISTICS ARE SO MUCH BETTER PLEASE IGNORE THE FACT THE PLAYERBASE WAS 15% BIGGER AND THE FACT THAT MOST KILLS WERE LOST FROM HIGHSEC/LOWSEC AND NULLSEC ACTUALLY GAINED KILLS
---
In addition to gear not breaking in a game like WoW, have a look at the prices of things. You don't purchase a WoW token to repair your gear.
---
If you're to wallet warrior your way to a capital ship, 500 PLEX, which you can compare to a single WoW token, pays for two or so regular caps. You need several of these WoW tokens / PLEX purchases to afford a super or titan with those funds alone.
---
But then again you'd have to look at how easy it is to obtain wealith in-game. As an example I PLEX a few accounts with in-game activities, it's not that hard and I don't mind doing so at all. Whenever I played WoW I could never be bothered to really farm gold, other than passive income that you get from actually playing the game. So I can't really tell anyone how easy it would be to obtain a token with in-game currency, then compare that to EVE.
---
People claims they're all players don't know for sure either
---
Yep, it says you harbor a lot of bots and kill a few every so often for PR like everyone else, we both know how this game works Dran.
---
Sometimes it's the comments that are cancer. This could be one of those times.
---
u r elite
---
more evidence, less sass please.  Don't be part of the problem give me something I can work with.
---
Consoles get in a week, PC gets in "winter". I feel bad for my PC bros too, *but*, Capcom traditionally is dogshit on pc or neglects it entirely (as well as... sort of the Western market as a whole sometimes lol) so, least we get something. 
---
BTW for any PC bros that need to scratch the itch while ratting or something, check out PPSSPP and a MH Portable 3rd ROM (after purchasing a physical copy of MHP3 to go with your physical PSP) if you're into that
---
&gt;It doesnt matter he says they are all the same when it's clear they are not.
---
They all have bots, he is not wrong.
---
The levels differ but that's just arguing over who is doing it better than who, we're still all doing it, don't act like we never knew where the renter money comes from when this has been the deal since forever.
---
Pretty much every TEST FC I've flown with recently wanted anchor and not keep at range for munins.
---
I haven’t! I’ll study the he subsystems later. I have Gallente cruiser V as of a few weeks ago (I took a break from my main accounts this month) all other prerequisites and supporting weapon skills are good.
---
Before I left in 2008 HAC was my goal, but coming back last year and moving to jspace had me filling in other holes first.
---
I will try that out in the sim in a few days, just off the bat I see it as a really expensive option over the Strat, it can be cov-op and bubble immune at the same time right?
---
I’m will I try anything once, especially since the rigs don’t get consumed so I can sell it easy if I don’t think it’s going to work/worth the added risk.
---
Love the propaganda. But whenever I see one party of a fight so desperately trying to maintain a narrative (FRT, the bad botters, Legacy the good guys, fighting for a better Eve), I wonder if all the shouting makes it more true.
---
Lol uhhh you came to the wrong place if u need this kind of help
---
That's the PR I was excepting, I bet you'll still say with a straight face that it's just rogue members too.
---
I brought back 3 accounts, did a month. Just subbed all 3 for 3 more. So there's that.
---
No. It would be nice to see ships instantly go to like 20000km/s and then accelerate from there so it feels like a warp instead of a slow stumble down a hill though.

This sounds sick
---
We're growing the next generation of Waffles ♡
---
Yeah but you dont actually play anymore... come back
---
Hey it's been fun fighting you guys too. When we used to rage roll, esoteria was usually an insta roll because of the hell camps and supers everywhere, but since blackout (not saying it is 100% the reason as people seem to be triggered by that) the fights there have been alot better. We have gotten some good escalations that didnt involve caps. Usually the trades were relatively even and no one was salty about losing anything. It's nice to see people defend their space in a way that allows intelligent gameplay to be used by either side for success.
---
Are market bots bad?  Are algorithms and shit used for real world trading?  Please cite more sources on the VNI part.
---
Actually i think the XIX relationship to Test is pretty similar to the relationship Legacy has with the Imperium. Different goals and origins, but same overall principle. The picture you painted with that comment is somewhat valid in my opinion, but not really meaningful since again, that can be extended to literally every alliance that works with a bigger alliance.
---
Currently it seems that ratting in null is more dangerous than ratting in the average C3 or even C5.
---
On the one hand it's exciting, but on the other I wonder if it doesn't unbalance things long term. Like, one of the key things in a WH site is that if you see someone on d-scan, bring up pathfinder and don't see any corp mates in system, you immediately know to pull drones, MTU and GTFO. There isn't really a safety net like that for null now.
---
Not until January
---
Except hes trying to make nullsec the bad guys and high and low sec the good guys. The truth it doesnt matter what regions you're in, it's all infested with shitty bots.
---
Something along the lines of 'we kicked them today, we know this has been going on so long with them that there is no way the Corp couldn't spot the faceroll names or tics but we gave them the benefit of the doubt, until now.' 
---
That would be lovely, 
---
I expect the best we'll get is a reminder ping from you in a week or two about reporting bots again, maybe take out the odd nyx toon to make it look good on the zkill link, not the faceroll named toons though, they're always safe.
---
yeah, this time :3
---
They said on twitter January
---
You must be better then me I can’t figure out how to make any isk to keep up. Do you live in deep null?
---
so I have to make a reddit post every time I kick a bot?
---
Hmmm
---
&gt; bot
---
No you do the ritual sacrifices already, I said Corp, a ping would suffice.
---
what problem does pinging solve when I find a bot?  we already blacklist them incase they try to get back in

Now that, I like
---
Yeah but muh site clear times.
---
The real answer is a Praxis, it’s as slow as a brick, but it has a fast clear time for its price.
---
He never mentioned high, low or null, he specifically talked about the blocs and he's still right.
---
I refuse to believe your reading comprehension has gotten this bad in a week Dran.
---
Fly around providence for a few hours and talk to some of the locals (if you can even find any that are undocked, lol), and tell me how much people are enjoying it. 
---
I mean, I guess HTP is enjoying blopsing on everything that moves, but that has caused provi to stop undocking, which has caused the TRC/TRU guys to stop hunting them. 
---
I was there for 2 hours this afternoon in my Hecate in late EU/early US time, which is normally prime time for provi. I found a kestrel (that ran away, not that I blame him) and a megathron, then found a bunch of tethered TRC guys, talked to them for a bit and ended up camping a bubble with them for half an hour (we saw nothing despite being 1 jump from 9uy), then eventually I found 2 Test assfrigs and fought them, killing one and dying to the other. 
---
Before blackout, the area was a million times more populated. The TRC entrance system always has catch bubbles up that you could shoot to call them in to fight you. Sometimes they had a small gatecamp. 9UY was super active with small gangs of a few people dodging the bigger ones and fighting each other. Now, it’s a ghost town. 
---
In the big blocks I’m sure it’s manageable, adapt or die is their motto and they are adapting. But that isn’t possible for smaller entities. If you include pvp only groups like Waffles or Unspoken, then yeah, they do ok. But small groups that are new player friendly and actually try to live in their space, rather than making money with alts in big blocs? Those are dying.
---
Amen brother. Also, I've been repeatedly yelling at the HAW dreads that show up mostly because they create an area of pure content denial.  A gang of like 5 cruisers and 3 tackle isn't going to sit there and and entertain that shit and why should they?  I keep threatening to the offenders from the caps group lol, though I have to make sure I declare **before hand** that this engagement is a strict NO HAW DREAD/CARRIER/SUPER ZONE!.
---
Look harder
---
In null, yeah. Used to rat in a carrier a while back with an alt in a VNI as eyes one jump out. Plus three characters running PI for the passive income. Which mitigates a fair bit of my expenses. I could also add 6 more to PI, just haven’t done so yet but will for sure in the future. Fill those character slots and train them into PI. Further training give them more utility if in a pinch. Such as extra cynos.
---
After the local blackout I haven’t ratted all that much. Mainly because I had a small semi-break. After the changes I dread rat, which pays out more than my carrier alone did. (Haven’t counted fuel + ammo.)
---
I have also heard that running higher level abyssals give you a pretty hood hourly income. Either in a Gila worth ~2b or dualboxing frigs worth ~800m per. Haven’t tried so idk.
---
Also keep in mind that I don’t really mind ratting for long periods of time unless there’s ops running.
---
Discussion starts at 38m 20s. Using the link to go directly to Twitch will link you to the correct time.
---
It really fucking sucks, especially considering that I'm new enough that those 50k SP can actually really help me out.
---
Stan?
---
But.. July is part of summer wars, so all of this assumes negligible summer war havingness to be comparible.
---
Summer wars make the stats fubar. Consider 2018's summer war. It got gimped by early successes jumping big move ops, then murdered in uax. Lots of losses, but lots of happy ops?
---
This year, withdraw, then happy imperials moving in with how much fun?
---
That is not a control and shifts numbers unpredictably. Does this mean, for example, that we had solo and small gang pvp EXTRA this summer to MORE than make up for less summer war?
---
Do we need to look at summer war 2017 for better comparison? 
---
I feel he picked numbers to fit his narrative also and july numbers are a bad choice to begin with due to variations in summer wars.
---
&gt; but since blackout (not saying it is 100% the reason as people seem to be triggered by that) the fights there have been alot better.
---
It's not just that but many of us have had our supers and titans for a long time now.  As long as you're not threatening the grazing animals (Rorqs) more and more people are generally a lot more willing to try to actually have a decent subcap fight.  The culture has changed I think simply because we see the opportunity to get better in subcaps instead of just LOL CYNO LIT HERE COMES THE WHAMMY.
---
I didn't realize all the apoc imperials died, when did this happen?
---
move? lol.....I live in catch but ok....
---
Maybe just avoid using pc's, smartphones or something else with an OS and access to the internet. Or just... dont surf on pornhub....
---
For real: the moment you go online or browse on some pages is the moment you get sold to sone marketing guys.

Thanks Qaeta for the reply, I should be there in no time :)
---
can confirm cloak does not trigger clock, it is only when you decloak, you can use this trick to get bookmarks if you want to bring friends or use a perch to bounce between cans
---
Yeah, I'm the same, and I get bored of it. It just needs a shake up.
---
And I think the blackout is a great thing for null, the bots are only a part of the problem the blackout is dealing with. 
---
The intel, and supercapital proliferation are some of the reasons I didn’t want anything to do with null, and moved to jspace instead 
---
The only thing lazy is how you where doing combat anomalies.
---
That's an apt comparison. Slide indexing the brokerage reductions againstJjita or the Maket leader would be a superior Idea.
---

Plex being sold for isk by npcs already a thing. Carneros, who used to work for CCP, said that CCP used to control Plex prices from getting out of control by seeding Plex on the market when prices got too high. That was back when CCP had an economist on the payroll to monitor the economy.
---
In some respects, this is a longer term adjustment and would initially influence seller behaviour. For a lot of traders (and many many players have trader alts) there's always a decision chart in terms or what and where to sell. 
---
Many people know that there are niche high profit / low volume markets, but they may not now take advantage of them. By adjusting the long term value equation of the brokerage percentage sellers will start to adjust their behaviour. That will influence buying patterns over the long term, and then it will influence content.
---
I parked my chars in a single system and bought a bunch of t1 cruisers for all, login 8 characters across 4 accounts and i'm done with it in 20-25min. :)
---
Some people consider sitting in a 100+ blob pressing F1 to be content, so yes technically a content creator.
---
The novice and regular help channels in game and forums will be 100% more helpful then here.
---
gf
---
Good folks, do this.
---
Um. There's really nothing wrong with making Eve a little smaller. As is, the game already feels huge as shit. Travel isn't exactly the most interesting part of Eve unlike a lot of other games where you at least get a change in scenery. It's also an indirect nerf to cyno range.
---
Buy some plex.
---
Do incursions.
---
Be in a null bloc and salvage behind ratters.
---
Do exploration.
---
Be better at pauper PvP and live off your loot.
---
&gt;The standard recommendation is not "join a newbie-oriented null sec group" it's "join a corporation".
---
On Reddit, the standard recommendation from Goons is KF and the standard recommendation from TEST is Dreddit.

“The only good Dino is a dead Dino. Are you doing your part? Learn more now.”

---
This change wont change the status quo of Jita presently or affect player owned citadel trade (no NPC brokerage). 
---
As you say if you want an easy one-stop-shop you go to Jita, but there are many, many reasons why many players will shop in the other hubs either regularly or on occassions. This change will affect seller behaviour in the long term and change the static terms of trade engagement for traders and eventually that will affect buying behaviour and the decisions for where to buy. We need this I think.
---
Its almost as if being an attacker should be hard and not just stomping on people in highsec. "I can't abuse the system to have all my buddies wardec them too therefore its too confusing".

Are you a data scientist? Its honestly pretty simple to eliminate a ton of user personas from the data.
---
So you’re telling me when all the null blocs turtled up as the blackout came, Goons as a null faction are not responsible for the lack of your own content. Even though in this very thread you’ve said you won’t go looking for content ‘cuz it’s not worth it’. All the lack of content you’re bitching about is your fault. Everyone else seems to enjoy it. I’ve really only seen the massive null bloc members bitching up such a storm. I don’t understand how calling you on your hypocrisy is a straw man argument, it seems you need to go back to a logic class. You continue to turtle and then bitch about how everyone turtles. It’s like you’re prefrontal cortex isn’t fully developed and you can’t see the consequences of your own actions. You dense fuck.

No that's statistics. Statics are made to be rolled until you find something fun.

Things got harder, Adapt or die. Motherfucker keeps talking about "the way eve is" like his way is the right way. Home boy needs to kick rocks on that dumb shit.

Until I figured out how to reclaim comments posted while in draft. Here are the previous comments not tracked:

You can anchor structures in Hek tho.
---
[**L-G-Flowers**](https://www.reddit.com/user/L-G-Flowers/)**:**
---
Fair point, not sure how CCP regards Hek. It (Metro) does the same value of trade as Rens / Heimatar (10 to 12 trillion a month). The Boundless Creation station could be used, or Hek could be excluded since it might not fall into the Hub definition.
---
**Blades of Grass:**
---
Market tax changes aren't a good start on a fix. You've got market capture here. People want to shop in one place which is why supermarkets have won over greengrocers and butchers. If a market doesn't normally have enough stock variety to let you shop for what you want you get in to the habit of going elsewhere.
---
For a market to get repeat customers it needs a vast variety of goods (supermarket) or else it is a specialist shop where you know you'll get what you want for a task you often want to do.
---
Player owned markets make the vast majority of their profits on plex and injectors because people will go shopping for those items as their entire shopping basket and don't actually need to travel to the market to pick it up (injectors) or don't have to worry about collecting their shopping with anything more than an alt in a travel ceptor (plex). This combines with per-shopping trip value to vastly outweigh anything else.
---
From a stocker's view what you want is a high enough footfall buying your stuff. If potential customer's aren't showing up then in Eve you aren't going to really do enough advertising to change patterns.
---
[**L-G-Flowers**](https://www.reddit.com/user/L-G-Flowers/):

This change wont change the status quo of Jita presently or affect player owned citadel trade (no NPC brokerage).
---
[6a6566663437](https://www.reddit.com/user/6a6566663437/) **Test Alliance Please Ignore**:
---
&gt;0.75% to 1.5% (sample numbers) total reduction over Jita
---
No one is going to bother shopping anywhere other than Jita for such a low savings.
---
You'd need something on the order of 20% or more.
---
This is a longer term adjustment and would initially influence seller behaviour. For a lot of traders (and many many players have trader alts) there's always a decision chart in terms or what and where to sell.

[traffic\_cone\_no54](https://www.reddit.com/user/traffic_cone_no54/):

So something like the industry index, for markets.  Cool idea. Will generate tons of salt if implemented though.

an app. mostly because trying to open youtube links in a browser is cancerous and that's what i spend most of my time doing on reddit because despite my post history i don't exclusively post on r/eve.

if i only used this sub, where i almost never click youtube links - eve is a fucking boring game to watch and your youtube memes are all regurgitated shit, folks - it wouldn't bother me which i used.

Unfortunately, I don't think I can adequately offer any sort of advice on how to deter players like that in the future, besides having friends that can pounce at a moments notice, an alt that can solo a gank Loki, or maybe a Skiff that's tanked like a brick shithouse, depending on what you lost.
---
It works really badly on mobile, hard to read messages.
---
Plus it shows comment boxes even in subs you're banned from, which is annoying.
---
Yeah. Much much fast acceleration and see deceleration would be awesome. More “movie” like and also more like some of the trailers CCP made.
---
Not if their ass pain is relevant...
---
Well that's nice to hear... I'm waiting for you bb
---
No it means the blocs, plenty of bots in low/high/null not in blocs but the blocs protection rackets are the big problem, he's still right.
---
I have level 10 aussie net that literally disconnects twice a day at random. HG and I'd be feeding 10bil in pods every 2 weeks.
---
PB is racking in so bug Cash we need to expand
---
It was an explorer Heron, not even 3m. The biggest gripe I have is shipping in the fit for a new one.
---
I’m with E-Uni, and the nullsec guys tried to help me bait the guy into attacking a tanked Probe, but he was gone by then. I wonder if increased NPC capabilities would allow the devs to let us hire bodyguards or something. It would be nice to have support from diamond ships if someone tries tanking me...
---
let me know when you find out what the other half of the menus do. ive been trying to figure it out for years
---
Yeweggum
---
😂 omg lol
---
I think it's more about the force escalation. If you get jumped by cloaky ships in your static c3 your buddies are only one jump out to start a fight. In null it's like 5-6 jumps for standing fleet to come to you if they even bother by the time they get there you are long dead and they are long gone.
---
tbh I forgot about you. C'est la vie.
---
There's a black hole known as "dracos'mom" some say it's a supermassive black hole that can swallow entire galaxies
---
Tldr: Grown man complains that it's unfair (in Eve, of all places!) that defenders are allowed to bring in extra allies hours before his guys make a final push to bring down a structure he's been bashing for a week. (So unfair...!)    
---
Also, he started a war in highsec without reading the rules of engagement, and doesn't know how logi works...    
---
Should've maybe spent that week learning about the new wardeck rules?
---
But I want to be Darth Vader in Rogue One!
---
Well...was just thinking that the 4 hour plane ride I take once a month across the US would be a great time to play.
---
People actually say gf in this game?  Wow, players are nicer in this game than I expected.  I've play a few PVP games where I can talk to the enemy faction.  The opposite side in those games never say gf or good game.  The Eve online community is awesome!  I'm glad I installed the game.
---
Yeah, was afraid of that, already doing the Reddit thing.  🙂.  Perhaps the new faster $10/hour streaming would do it...going to have to try it.
---
I have had good luck on hotel WiFi, almost everywhere, and it’s a great use of a few hours each night...or six...or whatever.
---
It's always a statistical anomaly when it doesn't prove your point.
---
Please find the exact quote where I stated "I won't go looking for content 'cuz it's not worth it" because it isnt worth it but I certainly have gone looking.
---
As an aside im not wasting anymore time responding to you you cocky brainlet
---
That is amazing!   Hmmmm, CCP needs to use you in a commercial or something...could you be the only one with a kill on a plane?
---
The only thing that's weird in this thread is how normal your behavior to those who know you. Have you ever tried to be constructive or do you like burning all the bridges you cross?
---
Yep!  Pyfa works jut fine.  
---
Was going to make so,e ISK while in the air...next trip I will pay for the streaming thing and give it a try.
---
So go kill them? You act like renters actually get protected. The only thing that's protected about them is the space itself not their ships.
---
Travel times are part of "power projection" which directly affects game balance. You've caught a carrier, muninn fleet is on its way to save it, travel times and carrier tank decide if you're gonna kill it or not.
---
So, I would be careful about increasing warp speeds for *all* ships.
---
I was using my own database of killmails (Taken from Zkill) to check, as I only have PVP kills in it.  It's only from between today and the start of this year.
---
Just taking from Zkill, which includes PVE losses on it.
---
Average kills per day before Blackout = 13842
---
Average kills per day after Blackout = 14363
---
Average kills per day before Blackout (1 year ago) = 15386
---
Average kills per day after Blackout (1 year ago) = 14525
---
Average kills per day before Blackout (2 year ago) = 15442
---
Average kills per day after Blackout (2 year ago) = 13756
---
I miss my 13.5 au/s interceptor warps
---
Hey Fat Elvis
---
Gatecamp all day every day.  If it weren't for 2010 waffles I'm not sure I would have enjoyed it then.  If it weren't for waffles I probably wouldn't have came back after 6 years
---
Well, the gf comes after the clone rape.
---
Im bothered by this because i was listening to chasey lain for the first time in years earlier. Spooky
---
Fcon did the same thing but it was like 75m/mo per character. Not just main iirc.
---
If you can't find fights you are bad and should biomass.
---
Got a buddy that 3riple boxes dreads in C5s making 3 billionish an hour.
---
The forums actually work nice in chrome on iOS.
---
We already agreed that attribute implants are not really a good thing for new players
---
You don't know the half of it dear
---
How would killing renters help with the problem of the blocs creating space to instill renters in for that sweet legit cash?
---
Killings renters is going to do exactly what it's done for well over a decade, nothing other than be a minor annoyance, a drop in the monthly profit bucket.
---
The blocs are the ones that actively carve out and encourage renter space, that anyone who's been involved at the top table, in any bloc since we began space rental knows, "most of the money is coming from bots but we don't talk about it, it's CCP's job not ours".
---
Space is a problem, rental space, who provides that again, I seem to have forgotten?
---
Lmao ofc youre a risk averse little bitch. Please daddy hilmar please make it so the scary null boys cant hurt me
---
Not gonna watch an 11m video unless you give us some more context to help us decide that it's worth investing that time.
---
This is one of the things that motivated me to do research.  TRC isn't much better off than we are.  They dont have the experience that HTP does so they feed just as much as Provi since they splinter group from Provi at least their leadership is.  Only the PvP Core is left in Provi for the most part and we are rarely docked up, but we dont exist outside of EU TZ and USTZ prime times.  Everyone else got rapture to Jesus it seems like. I kinda like the depopulating hopefully rebuild with a better culture, but finding people to put up with CVAs bullshit is a challenge in itself.
---
Good food
---
&gt; don't have to worry about collecting their shopping with anything more than an alt in a travel ceptor (plex)
---
you can interact with plex from the assets window as well...
---
Lot of the regular implants are from LP stores.
---
To get the rare ones, be they from direct drops or bpc's, that encourages people to get out there to run sites. To use ammunation, to perhaps be destroy, or to destroy the attackers.
---
Market taxes, industry taxes, blueprint material demand.
---
Everything like that helps in its own way.
---
I would sacrifice your child for the ability to assign some of the attributes good and bad just so I don't blow 200mil on garbage worse than what went into it.
---
I guess i’m stuck with it then. Unless, would it be possible to create your own?
---
what if you're just gay pwnd
---
Always gf in local, even if you podded them and scooped the corpse.
---
Regardless of taxes and what that should/shouldn’t be, why should CCP actively work to tear down something that the players created? Jita did don’t come from any broken features or anything of the sort, it came purely from the players. It is probably one of the best examples of the sandbox nature of eve. CCP has originally wanted smaller regional hubs (I believe this was mentioned in the CSM ama that happened a couple months ago), and still Jita came about despite that. Why should CCP tear that down?
---
To understand the menus u need a Master Degree in: economics, sociology, quantum physics, rocket science and also have professional skill in Excel ... but that is not required to just play the game.
---
Serious now, just don\`t discourage, it will come to u in time.
---
you're working under the false assumption that all of these are things meant to fight bots.
---
I just had this conversation with someone else today
---
Hellmar said this was the most vibrant summer in the past 5 years  based on DAU/MAU.  Well thats not available to us.  So next best stat to determine possible vibrancy/activity I figure kills could be helpful.   Only sought to figure out was this really the most vibrant summer in the past 5 years.   No narrative. Wars are part of the game and what makes it vibrant.  Burn Jita events are part of the game and what makes it vibrant.  Anything that makes anything blow up makes the game vibrant since that what the game is about the bounty hunter, the pirate, the merc, the soldier blowing stuff up.  The drifter thing had its affect that caused the NullSec bloc cuddle up more, then you had the SP events, and then finally blackout.  So much happen this month was it a net positive or a net negative what I would like the answer and not take CCP's word for it.
---
Best way in Eve is to join a new player friendly corporation.
---
And never start as miner. It looks tempting, getting rich after a lot of hard work, but that's bullshit. Waste of time as your yield is low at first. Learn the PvP aspects of the game, get free ships and worry about industry later.
---
Why not make all ships teleport or FTL jump without cyno maybe?
---
The universe in Eve should feel big.
---
Um, we have plenty of our own bots thanks, you do too.
---
[Real life meeting with Chribba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kftV3h_QveA) the Veldspar must flow!
---
1) Blackout is great 
---
2) VNI change is great
---
3) Alpha is the old free trial with a fancy new name, either upgrade or deal with it
---
4) Just use a citadel
---
Cause your mum loves them
---
I wonder how Blops/marshalls,recons, and bombers that move via covert cyno factor into that metric.
---
Your own forum app? If reading and posting on the forum is exposed via the ESI/API than I don’t see why not, but I don’t think it is because it would already be part of apps like Neocom II.
---
I downloaded eve portal, thinking it already had a functionality like that, but it doesnt. :( I just prefer the look of everything spaced out and the scroll function would be better than on a mobile browser. 
---
Anyway, cheers!
---
Explain pls
---
Dev team that do not play their own game. Nothing to see here...
---
Or they can... You know, ask someone who plays the game.
---
Actually, it's the opposite.  I was expecting kill amounts to have been down around 20%-30% and made the script to see if I was right.
---
My script told me I was wrong.
---
In the context of player creation in the sand box, I think your point is fair, maybe more than fair. While trade and economy couldn't be regarded as pinnacle gameplay, economy and trade are key careers in the Eve dynamic.
---
My suggestion on this is based on shaking up static (cum boring) gameplay. So, per se, while this might have been created by players (genuinely) in the sand box, there's no harm in shaking the tree and see if the players swing or shift from the view 10 years ago.
---
I don't know if you've looked at the charts lately. But botting in null sec is basically dead now. Now it's really just high sec people who bot now. I can think of 3 specific people who run 30 man rattlesnake fleets botting in high sec making tens of billions of isk a day for rent. But no one talks about them. Or the high sec market bots who drive inflation in this game. Rqqental space is a joke amount of money compared to what high sec bots are doing.
---
If we Conquer drones and geminate the blue donut will be complete Mua ha ha ha ha! 80 % solution right now, we are so close!
---
I share your disappointment in the portal, I currently can’t compose new mail, I get a connection error message every time I finish typing in the recipient’s name in the “to” field.
---
Not that this was explicitly stated by CCP.
---
Where do I find this pvp core, exactly? I was looking in 9UY and was finding literally nothing, there were a few severance guys up in their pocket near Dital, but they were in a battleship and a t1 frigate, so I had to run from the battleship and the frigate had to run from me. I’m sure there’s a few more stuff undocked deeper in, especially in the Coalition Hispania pocket, but I can’t really get that far in without dying to a gatecamp
---
You cannot. T5 sites yield you 200-300M per hour these days.
---
new eden is a star cluster rather than a full galaxy, so its smaller and closer than a full galactic system. Not 100% relevant but useful to remember.
---
There are quite a few black holes but most people never visit them. most of us travel interstellar space via the stargate network. These gats tend to only be built in systems fit for habitation. Something most systems with black holes wouldn't be.
---
However wormholes can connect to systems with extream environments. Black holes and pulsars for example. Sleepers and talocan being almost 100% spacefaring have no need for habitable worlds so the wormholes go to everything
---
So why are you here?
---
🙏😩
---
I've always said that everything should have EVE capabilities too.
---
School
---
Work
---
... My marriage
---
Hauling is free because I do it myself?
---
i dont quite remember but its either first number is 24 hours, second is 1 hour, or first is 1 hour and second is 15 minutes
---
exactly, it wasnt explicitely stated.
---
Big oof, i’ve been using the neocom II for evemails and stuff.
---
I mean everyone starts training Amarr for the laser light show.
---
Get your wife into Eve.. 😆
---
There's literally a Help button ingame, which links you to a help chat channel
---
Thankfully I have plenty of all 3 types 😂
---
This game has so many zillion mechanics, it's simply impossible to teach you them right away. Be patient.
---
Well it's more like an obligation than being nice.
---
"Theres about a thousand threads with people complaining about this but **MY** thread is the one that's going to make CCP change their mind"
---
feeling lost is a main part of the game
---
the prettiest lossmails
---
&gt;For the same reasons, the VNI has also become one of the most commonly used ships among those who break the rules by engaging in **botting**.
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/puuipi/vexor-navy-issue-and-alpha-clone-drone-skill-changes
---
You are talking about wars and empires.
---
The first no longer exist, the latter are already built and established.
---
Hey, Brokerage discount indexing based on hub would be a further lever over standings (as I mentioned in the initial comments),
---
I appreciate your point about "refitting everywhere", if you would consider that 4 or 5 hubs isn't 30 and that's a material difference. While asset proliferation shits me I don't see that as a major result. It's intended in the middle term - for buyers-  in making the other hubs being viable shopping malls on a price basis against Jita. Long term, not sure, I'm just wanting a shake up.
---
Regarding Citadels and Markets, they have proven good on some market lines, but their destructibility has a negative convenience factor against the NPC stations - and this is proved true for every hub actual.
---
S3verance does a roam every night.  I may be FCIng a Talwar gang tomorrow night. We roam all over Provi but mostly around 9UY, KBP, and TRC space.
---
And they usually use motor oil instead of maple syrup :)
---
'Pearl Abyss perspective'? That's the dumbest thing I will read today.
---
CCP might not be doing great the last few years, but boy, you don't want to see what PB will do to that game before they milk it to death...
---
Player count and kills are both decreased. Especially since a lot of kills this month are from drifters, and a lot of logins are for free sp.
---
Of course it is, you understand it takes time to rework the software right, you can't possibly be naive enough to think removing local is the end of null bots.
---
&gt; can think of 3 specific people who run 30 man rattlesnake fleets botting in high sec making tens of billions of isk a day for rent. But no one talks about them.
---
Probably cos that particular one is a big fat whopper.
---
Thanks for making my point for me, much appreciated.
---
So pando , darkshines , exonfang before he left ? Nah I dunno , darkshines always hated the fact INIT held Querious, he even named the f-n cyno gen “ darkshines hates this place “ due to the amount of times he had to come save people and obviously enjoyed doing so 
---
But either way it would seem they are getting ready for moves 
---
Dark ShinesToday at 7:25 AM
---
@everyone 
---
Ok, with yesterdays test run over we will be doing the following to make sure everyone gets moved out of Querious.
---
1) Everyone needs to consolidate their assets into F-N Keepstar, everything.
---
2) Do not move things solo, do everything as a corp or work together in the alliance fleets.
---
3) We will be organising the move fleets in 2 segments. We will be unloading everything into ZXB Keepstar as part 1 and then we will do further move ops to get people from ZXB into Fountain as part 2.
---
4) Alliance titans will be deployed along the route and down into Querious itself to help people get assets into F-N, and then moving towards ZXB.
---
5) FCs will be asked to keep fleets to a minimum for the next few days with the focus on getting everyone getting relocated.
---
6) Strat Fcs will run super moves but there will be other move fleets to ZXB from non-strat fcs.
---
Things to note:
---
Fuel will be seeded into F-N tonight as the market is sadly lacking.
---
The alliance will keep move fleets running over the course of a few days but expect these to taper off - we won't be running move ops for the next two weeks non stop - so I would encourage everyone to get all of this sorted as soon as possible (real life allowing of course).
---
Watch for pings for fleets!
---
The 1 jump is how far you are from the system you're looking at. Look at the system adjacent to it - you're in it :P
---
This might be the dumbest thing I've ever read on the Internet, I really hope it's a /s but I actually think you are serious.
---
Dont be so naive CCP played a blinder and used you to kill the bots.  Created a backstory around drifters and ta-da.  It was always about eradication of bots.
---
Do I think blackout is good yes and no.
---
I never understood, why the ships have different warp speeds as they change to a continuum where mass doesn't seem to matter. All ships should have the same warp speed by default. It should be  slightly variable by using special modules, but not more than 5%  
---
;)
---
There is a black hole in the center of the new Eden cluster. Look for the point of no return landmark on the map
---
sounds too simple.. i don't believe it
---
If you're talking about the Texas law grant then lmao. 
---
But no. He tried to poach some guys after he left mcav and made killmail delivery services.
---
You made a mistake. You were corrected. The person did it well and haven’t made any unnecessary claims. 
---
Now it is your turn to accept and move on.
---
Instead you are making yourself look bad.
---
Except you didn’t because you are here complaining about it.
---
"If you have no reasonable arguments in favor of your opinion you can just insult your opponent"
---
&gt;Just yesterday was a 200b ish (I think) fight.
---
Cost of the fight is a useless metric to say how many players were involved
---
Agreed, I think it should decelerate at an instant on landing. Be way cool to warp to a station, planet, or the sun and BAM! there is is. Same from initiating warp. Just boom gone not a slow ass build up.
---
TIL this is not once per day per account. :(
---
Fit a leshak and join a wormhole crop. Make 300+ mil per hour if you krab with someone
---
I've been doing the event on all my characters (except one who's in an astero in a wormhole, too much effort to scan the static everyday and pray it doesn't lead to 0.9 or 1.0 system). It's a grind, but you can never have enough SP and it doesn't cost money like injectors. Except for my main who can't do it because he's in 1dq, I've been repeating the first tutorial to get sp quickest.
---
How do you time your bombs? Is it immediately after the locked ship icon starts flashing?
---
Its like Malcanis' Law is just some guy's opinion and not a law at all
---
As someone who is very acutely aware of botting activity by hunting frat all day. I'm telling you bots are not doing anything right now until they figure out a work around.
---
I have a "noob" toon, who just salvages getting around 100m in salvage an hour.
---
Definitely worth it
---
fight test, goons and Russian on the same time is kind tough. Need to separate them next time.
---
Same
---
Didn't dispute that they're doing nothing right now. Even ours have been taking a break and we've got the eso police, programming takes time.
---
their in cyno was killed, i don't think they managed to get their whole fleet in
---
so where did they say all these changes are to counter botting?
---
Two mates, all in hawks. Nice tidy 200m a hour. Abyssals are good isk for newbro and old a like.
---
Not a fan of those either. Without local I don't see why we can't have an anchorable anti-cloak bubble now with the same mechanics as the mobile warp disruptors. And cynos on both sides need to be toned down somehow, this instant escalation meta just creates ganks 95% of the time.
---
I think we watched the same video (or repost)! /r/FellowRedditors
---
We don't replace stolen goods, sir
---
Yeah won't someone.*please* think of the new players trying to make a few bill a day to get by :(
---
in the context of eve, gf is just passive aggressive humor 99% of the time
---
sounds about right, i mean what were you expecting... what about anything ccp has been doing recently makes you think they play this game at all?
---
Its true, instead of implementing AI to detect/ban bots, make some incubator where suspect is teleported to check if its a bot or not. They are nerfing/changing game mechanics. Are the changes good?
---
\- Yes, but they hurt small PvE groups,
---
\- Will they adapt? 
---
\-No, Pve is pve, if they changed game mechanics enough to build PVP/PVE capable ships it would be diffrent.
---
\-There is not enough fitting space to make efficient capable of fighting back a full pvp fit, you can only fit 1-2 escape modules.
---
\- Most pvp are more risk averse then pve... They will hold you long pointed making mwd ready to run when reinforsments are landing on grid.
---
**Big Deal is a removing social aspect from nullsec, ELITE PRO PVP dont care about social aspect of the game, cause they are in group of few poeple, PvE players are making more social contact with environment to trade/defend/avox/argue.**
---
More toxic then current changes are people like suitonia, they vote for everything they personally like  regardless  other people play style in a huge sandBox game. You can call them selfish blindfolded fools. Online numbers are droping hard, EVE had to much space for \~40k online and now with spike up to \~25k this will put more pressure on remaning Pve krabs making eve market great.
---
Damn, loot fariy was not kind at all.
---
I thought i had accepted it. I made a mistake i did not know that about the name. Nor did i intend offense over it.
---
Shhh! Don't break the narrative !
---
This is not always an IQ and git gud question.
---
Some people have slower PCs and Gatejump might take a second longer. Maybe someone wit a BS landed a couple meters off gate and has to approach first. Maybe they didn't get fleetwarp for whatever reason and lack a bit behind. 
---
Sure, if you want half a minute after each gatejump you likely get everybody, but sometimes things have to go faster than that.
---
Nah, not really. Content is quickly drying up just like you fucking retards were warned about.
---
Watching you faggots jerk each other off on reddit to attempt to drum up hype about it is fun tho. 8&lt;)
---
Gf
---
&gt;Am I doing something wrong or is the main problem with rorqs the multibox problem and scalability
---
That's exactly the problem. The massive scalability of the Rorq combined with its durability (which includes a free, no-consequences, six-minute fuck-you immunity to all damage ever) combined with the endlessly respawning ore anomalies in nullsex is what makes them so economy-breaking. It doesn't help that it's really difficult to detect a botter running multiple Rorquals if they use even the most basic of defensive measures (eg. not running a single account for more than 8 hours at a time, using proxies, etc.)
---
And all you need to do to solve this is to limit the number of Rorqs which can be sieged on the same grid and/or get rid of infinitely respawning ore anomalies. Have anoms work like they do in wormholes, where you have a fixed set of anoms which respawn randomly and persist until they are destroyed, so they will over time cluster in areas with low activity.
---
You won't be multiboxing 20 or more ratting carriers. People easily do that with rorqs
---
"Would you like to know more?"
---
Another TEST guy sucking his own dick. Boring.
---
Only one kind of misattribution of quotes though.
---
People think imlazy and not paying attention all the time, its just that im always waiting to get into warp when they are ready to jump the next gate.
---
Which is not great given i FC here and there xD
---
gf...……..wait, I missed the fight.
---
Is the shield command mod allows you to sort of detect cloaked ships?
---
Yesterday I was ratting in a C2. My drake had a shield command module on it and when the mod cycled, I saw the agress timer goes on.
---
I have assumed its a side effect of the module and a stealth ship is watching me on the site or approaching me.
---
Anyone knows what this was?
---
i second this. ur gay pwnd
---
wtf is a threeriple?
---
also no he doesnt
---
also no you dont
---
I submitted mine but it's not that impressive if you dont count the mountain bikes worth 12k next to it.
---
To complete the dotlan data for a better picture 
---
2019 nullsec
---
PodKills 	168,738
---
Jumps 	34,719,688
---
2018 nullsec
---
PodKills 	181,645
---
Jumps 	39,873,724
---
to me that indicates that the ship kills data is more PVE than PVP
---
THANK YOU FOR YOUR'RE SERVICE WARRIOR HOOAH!!!
---
Yes, I also have bad latency so I bomb the very second the red flash of someone dying happens. There's also a sound cue cause you stop aggroing them the second they die.
---
un-be-lievable
---
T20 - One rogue GM abused lack of internal controls and was consequently fired because of it. Now you are here, spinning a conspiracy theory how 'whole company' favors certain players and play styles...
---
You basically shot yourself in the foot right at the start.
---
These stats are good.  But would be better to dive deeper, if the information was available.
---
For example:
---
- How many solo and small gang kills vs. LY?(absolute or percentage)
---
- How many unique players involved in kills?
---
- How many unique alliances involved in kills?
---
Absolute number of kills is one thing, but it tells you very little about what type of PvP is happening.  
---
If the sort of numbers had been achieved through lots of smaller engagements, involving more people (as opposed to big bloc fights that can rack up big numbers fast), that would be quite impressive.
---
tldr; total kills, even if you can measure them accurately, is a crude measure and tells you absolutely nothing about the general quality of life or levels of the satisfaction across the player base.
---
FWIW, I’ve loved Blackout and the response seems heavily in favour of it on Reddit. Obviously that definitely is NOT a scientific observation!
---
just pretend they are combat probing
---
What skills and fit does your HS Incursion alt has ?
---
I also like how your little profile pic is there. It makes it feel more like part of the eve universe than just posting on reddit.
---
You must've been in a wormhole mate; they're pretty easy to confuse nowadays. Everyone I talk to in null dislikes the change.
---
Or just avoid the spyware, like spycord.
---
Completely new to this game (it's installing atm) and I come accros a lot of acronyms and jargon that I don't yet understand. Is there like a place where I can read up on the different terms used and what they mean?
---
Havent heard anything about. Instead of making the vni useless, they should have made rats go for drones. This would fix the carrier ratting. CCP making very strange decisions as usual.

Don't let this distract you from the fact that we need a low sec gate to stain.

&gt; Jita did don’t come from any broken features or anything of the sort, it came purely from the players.
---
Wasn't jita originally full of Lv4 mission agents and lots of belts?
---
&gt;Speaking from experience with the harbinger Navy which only gets a 7.5% tracking bonus when the new vni gets 10% per level, this is highly possible to make rail track.
---
No, because pulses have higher base tracking. Heavy pulses with scorch have ~24 tracking. 250mm rails (which you cant even fit on the vni) have 8 tracking.
---
&gt;With javelin ammo and a TC since 4 mids, well you can play with them to make it work. 
---
You can never fit a tc because slots, and it wouldnt matter because railguns base tracking is so low.
---
&gt;Heavy pulse lasers Can kill a 5km/s 20km ceptor in a shot or 2 depending on make and tank. Beams also hit very nicely but naturally not as well but still sufficient.
---
Harb navy might be able to do that, but not the normal harb because no tracking bonus.
---
&gt;Specifically since you don't even seem to want to experiment but would rather wallow at the bottom of a subreddit feed because you don't like change.
---
What you cant know is that i have been playing for over 10 years. I have tried pretty much every possible and impossible combination.

I dont fuck with WH besides logistics

well neither can that cyno ibis, or ratting vni, but it still count as a kill

If you take out excavator killed then the numbers of actual ships being killed dropped like a fucking brick lol

&gt; /r/eve summed up
---
your posting
---
Ironic. He could criticise others for whiny circlejerks, but not himself.
---
You're a liar or an idiot or both. You aren't going to make 3b an hr with 3 dreads in a C5 even if you do everything perfectly and you discount the warp times.
---
Another isk sink is getting  alliances to fight and loose ships.
---
Tut tut Kilo!  
---
Just to clarify - I pushed for the Alliance to move into Querious when we had to pick if we wanted Querious or Fountain. At the time it suited us well but unfortunately we outgrew it. As for me hating Querious, I love Querious, it just happened to highlight a lot of the idiots we have in Alliance over time.  
---
The F-N beacon wasn't named by me, I think (but am open to being wrong) that it was STK who named it that after I had to drill it into some peoples heads that despite my rumoured leprechaun magic I still cannot make titans jump to a cyno which is in the same system as them - use keepstar cynos not beacons!
---
I dont  do it dude.  Idk how it works.  I do not do stuff in Holes besides find shorter routes to hubs.  Dude does makes stupid ISK
---
Think about it more logically thou, CCP "doing some tests and capturing data"  
---
Runs test with perfectly visible amounts of balanced SP  
---
results: players love it.  
---
Runs test with hidden results makes it look unbalanced Sp when its actually not  
---
Results: Salt everywhere.  
---
I shouldn't be saying this as it probably stops your mental torture but think about it logically for a second:  
---
A players gets these set of amounts of sp:  " 10k 10k 10k 10k 10k 10k 10k 10k 10k 10k 10k 10k 50k 50k 50k 50k 25k 25k 50k 50k 25k10k 10k"  
---
But CCP randomized the order that you get that sp and keeps everything hidden so that you the player think you are not getting a fair amount when in actuality everyone will end up getting the same amount in the end assuming players don't skip any.
---
Triple dread c5 ratting is definitely a thing. And it definately makes assloads of isk.
---
its really really good isk but its not 3b an hour, that's not just severely inflated but a straight up lie.
---
Perhaps this will allow Concord to divert some of their new defense budget isk to build a lowsec gate somewhere useful ....
---
For me that's like CCP using bots to cheat on players.
---
But a lot worse than farming bots.
---
You missed one, free SP for botters to switch ships easily and not damage the login numbers for those dank money bonuses from PA.
---
Spai alt burnt.
---
not 3b an hr
---
&gt;U want balance in something that isnt made for you.
---
Why does it matter who it is made for?
---
&gt;And 5 min delay, loooool. Who is even gonna use them?
---
Having carriers dropped on almost every fight is undesirable and kills content.
---
&gt;But they have no other usage. You understand that right?
---
The have other uses, and it doesnt matter anyway.
---
&gt;Thats why you are saying these things. Its not about balance, you just dont like them. Tough shit.
---
It's because they are overpowered that I want to cut down on their use.
---
&gt;Shit is stale because players who cant do shit have somehow convinced CCP that they matter. If you combine all the PvP you do in a month its still nowhere close to the destruction NS does in a matter of days. Get that into your head. We send out more fleets/day that I can count and they fight similar fleets. You think small gang even matters?
---
You cant fight because it only matters who has the most caps and they are instantly available.
---
&gt;Shit is stale because we cant fight more. Its because of fozziesov, because of cynojammers, because of the endless fking timers. Thats why the game is stale, its tedious to fight atm. Everyone knows this dude, try actually fighting on a large scale and you would know 2.
---
No point in fighting because it's predetermined in that the alliance with the most caps almost certainly wins.
---
&gt;EDIT: A large part of the reason why the IPH of the Rorq is so low is because you have so many people multiboxing them to ludicrious extents under essentially impenetrable super umbrellas who can very effectively flood the market with minerals.
---
But also that the value in Rorq Mining resides in the later step of the process. What you get from mining, you can really easily double or triple it with the correct production setup.
---
How much is it really.  Cause I was thinking of taking my caps out of Provi if its a good as he say it is
---
That too.
---
This is good advice.
---
If you go to J-space, and see a pulsating butthole on the skybox, well, that is a black hole.
---
Maybe not, but we agree with him
---
You can run a Core Garrison or Core Stronghold in about 3 cycles if you are set up real well. Let's assume you're still learning the ropes and you finish in 3.5 cycles, so that gives you 253M for a Garrison or 234M for a Stronghold. Then you do another cycle to kill the drifter, so 300M. In 4 cycles (20 minutes), you've made ~550M. Discounting rolling, warp types and warpin setups, you're doing about 3 sites in an hour of actually shooting stuff. It's about 1.5B worth of blue loot in an hour (actually more like an hour and a half).
---
Adding a third dread will cut it down to 3 cycles (15 minutes) and maaybe let you do 4 sites in an hour of actually shooting stuff, so "2.2B/Hr".
---
You also need to have a consistent amount of sites to keep this up. There are times when you're just on a garrison or stronghold drought or you get like one or two spawns for a couple days.
---
I hAvE nO cLuE wHaT aN iSk SiNk Is
---
Thank god
---
Did they get nerf or something, cause I just found reddit post from about year ago sugguesting that you can get up to 3b/hr.  2.2B is till crazy
---
So OP is Kiloalpha? The guy thats more bitter than a goon on nc and more useless than a provi super fc! gotcha! moving on.
---
TIL: Statistics are Wormholes!
---
Yeah because some of the funnest fights started with the FC asking permission to engage in a fight whilst allowing the enemy to bring a fair fleet to counter us
---
/s
---
We get it bro, you can format a post
---
lets make taxes 70%, like real life
---
man should we tell him about the role tables
---
reeeeeee
---
It’s just like, your opinion man
---
*The Kardashian Collection"
---
You can scan excavators like that
---
Isn't the wormhole spawn constellation wide? That works because of the random connections, in null rorqs would just burn through some fuel by moving systems in their constellation.      
---
The respawns had to be inter-regional to work in null.
---
It's been some time since i kept up to date with WH mechanics. Back then it seemed widely accepted that this is how respawn works in WHs.     Is that still the case?
---
No, people just lie about shit.
---
In space no one can hear your lonely cry...
---
If I remember correctly, according to lore the stargates were towed into position by being transported there at the speeds we normally travel at to get across systems. So it took hundreds of years to spread across the cluster even though stargate travel is instant once they're in place.
---
When I was duelboxing on a intergrated graphics that loading was never a big deal just 4 seconds max behind everyone else loading grid from a jump and it never made me get behind.
---
Even in 50-60man fleets I haven't seen it be a issue as long as the people are competent. Maybe in big bloc groups this is a issue but it's amazing how many people can't stay on anchor in those fleets too :shrug: it really seems like the quality of players that's the issue.
---
Hey I’m the one leaking intel here paddy , you’re not supposed to leak my infos !!! That’s not how this works :(
---
Yeah! We say gf while starting into empty eyesockets of your clone's skull made into an ashtray.
---
I prefer the 2X neut tristan myself.
---
The logs show nothing
---
Where do you mine so we can send you a special delivery? 🙂
---
Hey that's my house!
---
That's not actually what I did, if you read what I wrote. It's more nuanced involving favouritism and bias as opposed to conspiracy. I know people on this sub like to work in absolutes, I don't.
---
I understand your point and i want all sizes of combat scale for Eve also. I am just explaining you why its hard for you to find content.
---
generally speaking hauling yourself in a regular freighter is silly, pubbies charge almost nothing, so if you do production in HS you just pay them and lose 1-5% of your profit. If you produce in null and you have a JF route direct from a hub seeded with your own cyno alts, this really isn't a time sink, the trip will be about 10-20mins each way depending on where you live
---
Also should be able to lock broadcasted targets with a ctrl click rather than having to right click first
---
Sounds like you might be using excatavors, do you have a permit for those?
---
It's called trailer for a reason
---
Could be. To be honest I'm not 100% on the details of spawn mechanics, no-one outside of Iceland is, but the suggestion stands. It's a simple way to handle resource depletion which remains compatible with the current anom system.
---
OP
---
That's...not an isk sink
---
How do you know they're there without local?
---
We aren't even trying to win the timers in scalding, as long as you give us content we are happy :)
---
more often than not the hunter says gf as "get fucked" and the hunted has to say gf because otherwise he will look salty af
---
&gt;how the fuck does it effect the big guy
---
Older, wealthier, and more entrenched players have more shit?
---
I don't rat anymore, mate. Like I say: it's literally not worth it.
---
With CCP's new chaos take they should replace all the ore in null with veldspar change my mind.
---
Oh, i wasn't disagreeing with that.      
---
I just think they have to come up with a new way of distributing anomalies rather than copy WHs. An addition to your point, if you will.
---
Because bots are still being caught and killed, just like they were with local in effect.
---
They've gone through like 5 nerfs and people are still putting 10 of them in a belt. Even using mining drones that cut the yield in half. 
---
People optimize isk making more than anything else in the game so why are they doing this?
---
/r/highsecminerworries

&gt;Hey Kilo

That's a mineral sink, not an ISK sink.

Did FC say jump?

Tax'es dont solve too many reach people problem it only puts poor new people on heavy pressure...
---
D[enomination](https://pl.bab.la/slownik/angielski-polski/denomination) \+ new tax rates + new bounty/reward system, would solve it better.
---
Oï !
---
Welcome to our wonderful game =)
---
You should find everything you want to know here : [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/EVE\_Lexicon](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/EVE_Lexicon). EVE University is a vital website for any beginner, so you should really bookmark it and refer to it when you don't know something, or want to know more about the ships or certain mechanics (although it won't go deeply into most of them). If you have any more questions, come ask me IG, I have the same username =)
---
Let me filter out broadcasts for reps.
---
Oï ! Sorry to say it, but you have it all wrong =/
---
First, the only ways to know if a cloaked ship is watching you, is to have seen it cloaking, or be within 2000m of the ship (cloaking devices cannot activate if there's anything within 2000m). Otherwise, there's literally no way for you to decloak someone else's ship...
---
The shield command module is a "Command Burst". It is a module that once activated, provide beneficial bonuses to members in the same fleet you are. Concerning shield command bursts, it'll augment your shield resistances, or shield capacity, or shield booster efficiency. The side effect to that is that once you activate the module, you'll have what is called a "Weapon Timer", that is way different than an Aggression Timer, even though both are red. The Weapon Timer prevent you from tethering or docking in any structure, which mean until it run out, you'll be sitting ducks in space, with the only ways to replenish your shield or repair your armor being friendly logistic ships, or local repairers.
---
You will always get the Weapon Timer if you cycle your Command Burst, no matter if there's a cloaked ship nearby or not. You might want to ask your corpmates for more details if you're interested in fleet boosting, or simply ask here, I'll make a pleasure to answer anything you might want to know =)
---
Have fun !
---
It normally should, however, you should remember that basically every taxes also went up. You might get the same value as before, or an higher one.
---
If I'm reading right, CCP want to make player pay more when they use NPC installations, but also making the Trading skills important.
---
I think, yes. It also depend if your nullsec toon is in an NPC station, or in an Upwell structure, where NPC taxes don't apply (but player ones does).
---
Mainly due to game balance reasons, EVE sticks to "bigger is not always better" quite well and being able to outrun heavier (tankier, often with more DPS and utility) ships in smaller ones is big advantage.
---
Uhhh
---
-4 to +4 is 9 values. 
---
Also this doesn't account for base module variables being different depending on meta level. You're looking at 9^4^10 on the low end.
---
It is the multiboxing issue.
---
Someone did a big math post not too long ago about it.
---
It takes something like over 200 days for a rorq pilot to pay for injecting another rorq pilot.
---
But then its 100 days for the next one, then 66 days, etc.
---
At a certain point you end up making more money than you could possibly spend on injecting more rorq pilots with overall very little real risk.
---
It's just unlikely that you would ever be losing rorqs faster than you could replace them, especially if you aren't literally away from your computer entirely when you are afk mining with them, since you just need to hear the alarms and then light a cyno.
---
Infinite multiboxing and low risk of ship death
---
I thought the cost was a slim jim
---
ah crap, logi on killmails next year???
---
I don't get why they would need to be treated as a material...
---
just put it in the taxes...
---
oh no single digit tax increase in highsex, we will all die now
---
(lets just ignore the 10% corp tax in 90% of corps)
---
you mined that ore, means its free, and since its free you cant charge for it so im just gonna take it
---
I feel sorry for you. They've almost been throwing out MCTs just a month ago. I have 12 left and have 10 extra skill-queues going atm.
---
You don't have perfect skills, guranteed. Even if you did, one rorq isn't that bad. But it's also next to no effort to multibox them. And each one pays for itself easily, and can drone assist and rep the others. One becomes two. Two becomes four. Four becomes eight. Eight becomes sixteen. Sixteen is just one person.
---
Great, now I'm listening to Eminem for the first time since I was like, fifteen.
---
I was out roaming a few days into blackout in some backwater shithole of a region. Guess what; the bots still docked up as soon as I entered system.
---
PVE krabs? Making market great? Pick one.
---
Taxes will go to owners in bigger extent that "extra" material in ISK that will be just removed.
---
&gt;they should have made rats go for drones. This would fix the carrier ratting
---
Rats go after fighters constantly, the key to their survival is that by keeping them moving they'll speed tank the rats, if you don't manually keep your fighters moving they quickly die to rats.
---
&gt;Havent heard anything about
---
..Doesnt mean they haven't been doing it. Ratting bounties across Delve, Detorid and Esoteria, the three krabbiest regions has steadily dropped from about 23.5t in January to 12.4 in May (and 8.1 in June but that's because Goons deployed to the North) the changes they've been making have definitely had decent effect on isk faucets. You can see it in the [overall trend chart](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/1FUIYXMo5TFxuh9zvSc2Jb/7e680d55cf4f461c7ec6620960711a4d/9aaa_top.sinks.faucets.over.time.png_w=900&amp;fm=jpg&amp;fl=progressive) from the MER too. Which is why "They should have cut the isk at the source - crabsec anoms" sounds pretty clueless.
---
I was going off what OP was suggesting which was going of OP's suggestion of -4/-2/0/+2/+4. And yeah that'd be per item.
---
gf Vas
---
Taxes that i suggesting are hardly putting poor people in the heavy pressure.            
---
You need to build/lose 10.000 T2 frigates to have the same taxation as a single titan.
---
That is where I am at it, honestly. PVE, PVP, and when I feel like I want to do a little extra, drop a few bucks every so often.
---
Why can't we all trade in PLEX and let ratting bounties be clailmed with dog tags.
---
&gt;Rats go after fighters constantly, the key to their survival is that by keeping them moving they'll speed tank the rats, if you don't manually keep your fighters moving they quickly die to rats.
---
&gt;Which is why "They should have cut the isk at the source - crabsec anoms" sounds pretty clueless.
---
So why did they nerf the VNI when its not a problem?
---
Thats great isk/hr for being semi afk. Plex is dropping too.
---
It was absolutely a problem. Back when I krabbed I couldn't be bothered to carrier/supercarrier rat for more than an hour at a time, too exhausting. But I could easily run 5+ VNI non-stop. They were a significant part of the isk generation.
---
Yep i know the power of that. I just wanted to run all the drones far away for let my friend micro jump the procu fleet 100km off the rorqual.
---
But all drones came back in the jump field range at the perfect time :/
---
Isn't it possible to scrap fleetchat logs fpr this kind of thing?
---
I'm not opposed to CCP implementing something like this, it just seems more likely/faster that some community guy comes up with 3rd party software like that.
---
Same, lets just all see how triglavian ships are gonna be cheaper than their t1 counterparts
---
But if rats go for drones, how can that be a problem?
---
Just no
---
Here's a wild idea. What if the EVE Portal actually just fucking worked the way it's supposed to?
---
How about less bounties, blue loot, tags and more actual loot that could be either used or reprocessed?
---
Imagine being in imperium and being too poor.
---
Fighting papa goons war and they have to fund the sov bill by direct contribution. Man they are in decline.
---
Just scroll through my morning reddit while drinking a coffee and having a smoke outside and was confused to why everyone was spamming girlfriend in chat. After a few sips and a few posts later I was like Ooooo they were saying good fight! Have my up vote.
---
tfw no gf
---
IM DEAD XD
---
That's where the fun is though, isn't it?
---
you have to find the right people. there are some salty cunts on here too lol.
---
\&gt; So I just joined eve today, and I mean I kinda get how it works.
---
Sweetheart, from the bottom of my heart, believe me when I say this: you don’t know how it works.
---
You’re most welcome, we’re happy to have you, but this particular rabbit hole goes all the way down to hell and that’s the switching station. After that it gets complicated.
---
I have a character that have gotten 50k 5 days in a row now. My main is yet to get more than the 25k one once or twice tho.
---
“I tried shooting at these Concord ships near star gates, but apparently that’s a bad idea."
---
Why Eminem?
---
This great poem above relates to a Bloodhound Gang song !
---
\*insert pikachu meme here\*
---
what more this also injects isk into the system from insurance ....
---
Wait. You're saying they don't have an active market in their staging?
---
How do they buy fuel?
---
Need higher res. I want this dying Rorqual as my background picture.
---
I second this, im not in Eve University but they will teach you everything you need. &lt;3
---
This is a mad lad move, but I love it!
---
Someone with less than 5mil SP won't care that veteran players get more isk value out of the event. They'll just be happy to get the sp.
---
I got impatient and just set them blue in personal standings.
---
big true.
---
Dog tags are actually pretty decent idea ;)            
---
/u/CCP_Falcon           
---
Imagine yourself that all rat bounty is replaced with tags.        
---
Those tags can be only sold to NPC buy orders [in the CONCORD higsec space](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Genesis/Sanctum)      
---
People need to move them there to get isk.        
---
There will be plenty people buying them at like 94% and moving them to desired area.        
---
Bilions in constant move ... and you need to pick up the tags from wrecks.          
---
Imagine yourself joy of the MTU hunters
---
This does tend to happen at the end of a war.
---
You ping everything as a MAX MAX MAX CTA and people stop showing up.
---
You keep losing fights and people stop showing up.
---
Thank you for the reply, it appears I left my loot for nothing:) better safe than sory I guess
---
***Fucking mad lad!***
---
There's no functional difference between -4/-2/0/+2/+4 and -2/-1/0/+1/+2. It stands to reason OP means a 9 point scale, else they wouldn't refer to +4/-4.
---
I remember the post you are talking about and iirc its more to the tune of 200 *hours* before your first rorq makes enough to pay for a second
---
Right now we are heading for "you want ship build it yourself".
---
Titans should be expensive in use, consume a lot of FUEL blocks to make industry people busy supporting war effort.  Same for citadel, make them use fuel or selfdestruct.
---
Btw. would be fun to make titans use fuel even docked. This would limit maximum titans numbers.
---
*Your* content is drying up. Adapt or... you know the rest.
---
So now you're mad they didn't use YOUR solution?
---
Oh you think market can be great without miners and industry? 
---
Ritght now boting is problem of healthy market, not the krab people.
---
Pls stop doing this ccp, there is a reason players of this game like the passive skill training. This mechanic makes it more of the mentality keep up or get out, and its making it less fun to play. These stupid rewards arent gonna get me ratting in null anyway.
---
This man knows the truth.
---
I recently joined RvB and it's really been a very good place to learn PvP.  
---
New pilots are welcome and you get lots of useful live instruction and advice when in a fleet.  Maybe not so important for your main, but our FCs put a lot of effort into fittings help to ensure lower SP pilots like me can also be included in their fleets.   I'd say RvB's culture is about having fun while you learn and improve yourself in real fights.  
---
I fly during EU evening we get into a lot of fights in Black Rise daily.  We also have experienced FCs and pilots in Canada/US, but I need my beauty sleep so I can't say much about fighting in the later TZs.
---
fellow amarican??
---
looks like me trying to find a home system after the triglavians wiped all my corps stations...
---
If you believe that, you'd have to suspect it happens the other way around as well.  
---
I don't trust any of these early reports either from the guy OP is trying to counter argue or OP's own conclusion to it which is highly biased as well.  
---
You can make any numbers support your argument by leaving conveniently selected data out of the equation.  
---
No one will be able to draw any sound conclusion from all this based on a month of data during summertime.
---
Not really, but we can see that once again, they didnt do what was good for the game. the incompetence is staggering.
---
The way titans are designed you need them to win any sov fights in null, so people are going to pay the fees no matter how high they are. Besides, worst case I'd just fly my titan without rigs and repackage it when I'm not using it.
---
Doesn't nerfing an individual rorquals isk per hour ultimately not change the outcome?
---
What they have done is balance rorquals around the assumption that everyone has 5+ hulls. Which just nudges even the more casual player towards having multiple rorqs, as the income is specifically balanced around running multiple ones.
---
Would buffing (un-nerfing) income per rorq while requiring more user input per hull not be a better solution?
---
Except I did because I have
---
Maybe your alliance should kick the spies I told them about 2 weeks ago. @tellrim @trygg
---
Think it thru - unreliable internet service is probably a pretty huge risk.  
---
I’d probably read a book or listen to some podcasts with that brief time
---
Cynos are great until they attack you in the staging system, which by definition is outside your jump range.
---
Very good point- do you know any good sources for reading on getting into industry?
---
I'm thinking of just making modules Or sub-hulls for alliance doctrine as there will always be demand locally
---
maybe FRT should stop max CTA quintuple pinging for every op and the members might be more willing to go on fleets :)
---
The first time someone said "gf" to me I thought it means "get fucked". But I am pretty new and play league every now and then, so "get fucked" made sense to me.
---
&gt;No Wingspan Flair
---
Flair doesn't check out
---
I’m glad you enjoyed it
---
As I replied above - is the nerf even well thought out? It actually encourages muliboxing
---
&gt;Doesn't nerfing an individual rorquals isk per hour ultimately not change the outcome?
---
Would buffing (un-nerfing) income per rorq while requiring more user input per hull not be a better solution? I.e. MUCH smaller rocks which require unsiegeing, warping off and back in more often, while also improving m3 mining amount? - same isk, more player action required. Also more chance of being caught out of siege for PvP content
---
Maintenance for asset that can be docked or logged out is bad idea.    
---
Again this is a game, what about people who don't play :               
---
* they are paying sub but got deployed - a lot of military people play in EVE                  
---
* they don't play atm due to various reasons ... ship is logged out ...           
---
Like do you really want to tell to those people that the moment they get back to game  ... first thing they see is a negative bill?            
---
On the opposite ... assuming that you are paying titan upkeep when you are subbed you are getting to situation where :          
---
* you have huge incentive to not keep this account subbed         
---
* or game the mechanic by contracting super (moving by corp assets)  to "alpha account" holder.
---
Given this is CCP, I got a feeling this isn't going anywhere anytime soon. 
---
When have they ever had something for a 1 month period that wasn't a sale?
---
Haha or maybe I'll just train up Hams and rapid lights. Thank you for putting it together for me.
---
Not really fun to brick shit needlessly.
---
Interesting they just brought those out, assisted drones would have still showed domis on previous killmails.
---
You can have the taxes be broken up into NPC and owning taxes. Just like how real taxes and fees are split up into many things.
---
Having it as a material doesn't make any goddamn sense.
---
Pretty sure manufacturing ALREADY has an npc tax.
---
Easy and cheap. Heron is actually best because of natural shield explosive resists and 5 mid slots.
---
Medium shield extender plus 2 active explosion shield mods, even t1 is ok if you overheat. Depending on skills, it takes one or two T1 micro auxiliary power cores in the lows to make everything fit with an MWD.
---
You don't even need to change rigs. Just refit off a mobile depot.
---
You mean you take a fight where you don't want to actually fight?
---
I agree with most of what you said but we can't really compare pre rorq era with how things are now regarding ease of access to supers/titans
---
ah, maybe.
---
I don't know how long a rorq takes but I guess that would make sense.
---
a Nag pilot takes 20b to inject...so that would be 200 rorq hours.
---
Thanks! That's very helpful, I'll remember your kind offer :)
---
Is heavy water free to you?
---
You are the disease.

---
according to this you should be able to 1 cycle the site with 3 dreads, then 1 cycle the drifter or just leave it for later. To my knowledge this is still doable.
---
Before blackout current vs 5 yr ave = -12.6%
---
After blackout current vs 5 yr ave = -17.7%
---
PY - prior to blackout vs ave = +11.1%
---
PU - after blackout vs ave = +1.1%
---
So it would seem looking at the fall off of kills would say that there was a bit less of that this time around
---
Also interesting that the amount of kills in 2019 is so much less the 5 year ave.  Eve is kill?
---

It wasn’t wrong when compared against the 5 year ave.
---
Yeah, fuck slutonia lmao
---
Its the only place where you can sell the niche stuff that won't sell on the open market. :&lt;
---
That and, "officially" its the place to give feedback ~~even though the devs visit reddit which was adopted by community as de-facto official forum~~
---
Yeah without miners a carrier pilot can add 2 weeks to skill into drones and mines for 2 hours then get back to ganking filthy carebears all month hahaha.
---
If CCP didn't misinform players. I wouldn't have a job.
---
What did his wallet say? Because you won't find any ticks there.
---
He sold the blue loot and you have to take his word for it how many sites he did and in what timeframe.
---
Ok now factor in a bomber gang deletes your excavators once every 30 hours of on grid time.
---
&gt; Doesn't nerfing an individual rorquals isk per hour ultimately not change the outcome?
---
Yep, the only solution is to make Rorqual multiboxing less desirable or practical. One way that can be done is to change it back to support platform it was, just make the boost powerful enough to be worth it or people will just use the next best ship due to better cost-efficiency and not needing to siege up.
---
I would be content with a rework of tether and vulnerability mechanics.
---
I never expected ascendancies what i expected was upgrades eventually from people.  (You see i was an FC there for like 2-3 years)  Some people were really bad with this.
---
Like let's look at it this way if you're making 150m/h (not even unrealistic; we used to do 180-210m/h easy with only the occasional TCRC) and assume a 10% reinvestment rate (ask the church why this should be) after 133 hours you'll have 2b and enough for the advanced vindicator in those days.
---
People unsubbing in masses
---
Wow... i get it but taking an accidental tristan kill and spin it into a 3rd party is a bit much lol
---
Nope - no negative bills.
---
Give it a special fuel, cargo hold for a year, if u dont load fuel, it will disappear do to lack of fuel to maintain.
---
Or auto move to asset safy for 50% of value.
---
Make warping - shooting use extra charge, easy.
---
You could move titans from accout bound goodies to alliance/corporation.
---
Citadels/PoS work the same way and no one complained about losing it if u drop the game for X amount of time.
---
Level 4 cap industral with lv 5 training
---
Excavators too. Am I missing any skills?
---
I thought it was quite low
---
What?
---
Positioning and separation is also a key part of fighting solo. Separating gangs, especially tackle, via warp speed is huge for pulling kills out of the blob.
---
You are talking about EVE online or did u change the subject to some starcitizen game?
---
Single account single box here.
---
I run DEDs  with a Loki. Also LV4 missions on low sec, and when we are on our prime, LV5 on Carrier.
---
I just fund my PvP. Not as crazy doing isk at all. If i hit a Nice Loot on a DED, i call it a day and jump in something to look for fights.
---
LV5 Blitz on Carriers are the best. But you need some control of the área. LV4 on low SEC are more than ok. And DEDs, well. You can walk with more than 1b in just 1 site. But it's random.
---
Join a #noPoltics group. No need to avoid being social.
---
i know i know.... i still feel dirty but we already formed and had eyes on those rorquals when horde jumped in and tackled them. There was one rag on grid so i decided to try kill it together with the panfam guys but the situation changed quickly. Going back on our word to work together was obviously not an option so we made the best out of it.
---
bf
---
Well.....it's a rock, and they are not known for their intelligence...."dense", though a bit mean, is probably appropriate. And given they also are a bit bit lacking in the "feelings" department....I doubt it will be upset with how it has been labelled.
---
That's Tikki doing C5s in perfect conditions. It's not the norm. Think of it like saying "I get 300M Ticks" because every so often you kill a faction supercarrier in a Haven.
---
Bots unsubbing you mean
---
One guy post two stats overall over the entirety of New Eden without any breakdown or analysis. Suitonia posts detailed stats over the different regions that shows the other post was misleading, and includes measured opinions and warnings about the data sources being imperfect.
---
But somehow this is "the same fucking thing".
---
They let a TEST nag roam around for an hour near 9UY. The core must have been sleeping
---
You'll likely make more ISK not buying WiFi and buying PLEX ;P
---
Its not thinking, its knowing.
---
HK tried getting a fight out of some c4 scrubs yesterday by RFing their shit. Popsy instead decided to dock and batphone their daddys ( tdsin and init ).
---
I wonder if they still run armor rattlesnakes.
---
Ya smokin the right stuff there bud?
---
Thanks for doing the math really detailed, I tried to point his statistical bias already in his thread.
---
Two days ago, I fancied some solo welping. Normally I would just clone into an empty pod in the same station and self destruct to get to 1DQ to get into something to welp. This time I was at a station without medical facilities.. I somehow skipped going to a station to get out of my implant pod and self destructed outside station.  Realized the mistake as the screen turned white.
---
RIP 700mil pod haha.
---
Mining ice is where the isk is. I did it when i was in Goons and was making between 250  and 300m an hour after reprocess with perfect skills.
---
F
---
half the fun in this game is learning for yourself. which you will have to do regardless what corp ya join.   
---
right click \*everything\* and keep learning. yes it's a huge sandbox. that's what makes it interesting.
---
wah the solo roamer isnt staying to brawl the 10 man reinforcement fleet without knowing what's being brought to kill him or if the ratter is in a baitfit. What a coward for not taking a fight where he 100% doesn't even kill anyone.
---
Imagine a PvE ship that's not optimized for maximum afk ticks, a new concept I know. It's difficult to find a ship that can catch it and hold it while still being able to fight it. The reason PvE players get fucked is because they fit for pure income. A single warp core stabilizer already fucks an MWD kiter.
---
Ty.
---
Well ... some say if you mined it yourself ... /o\
---
they switched to armor gila
---
Free if you mine it
---
What's the difference at this point?
---
or R64-Moons with 500-1.000 Mio ISK/hr
---
Then maybe he should bring friends? If the only thing you can kill us a ratter you are not a PvPer.
---
Sadly just cherry and mint vape stuff.
---
dont think anyone respects fedup anyway
---
We do not. TEST leadership has gone on the record with kicking/awoxing botters repeatedly.
---
&gt; asual players looking to unwind by mining and killing some red triangles when they get home from work... not take medication for their nerves because at any moment a pirate can uncloak and kill your ship
---
If the game would offer a safe space for those guys not willing to put in the effort and take the risks necessary for bigger rewards ... maybe I would call it Hisec ...
---
No. You think we harbour bots. Once we spot a bot, it is killed and booted from the alliance.
---
Maybe. I got tired of trying to find stuff there as well.
---
Much like nobody respects the shit pile known as goonswarm?
---
I guess the problem is kills are only one measurement of activity. Players being safer or forming more truces, new wardec rules etc reduce total deaths.
---
 "Why would both Red and Blue join Caldari? No idea. "  
---
so that we can purple fleet and all fire at the same war targets.   
---
there is still a setup for red vs blue pvp in our home system, doesn't get used much but it's there for people to host events or have 1v1 duels.
---
that is a shitfit
---
Ye crying is the same as presenting facts. I get why you might conflate those 2.
---
For over 2 years close to every system in Feythabolis and Omist was harbouring bots, the people running these bots even exposed themselves in widely recognized posts in this subreddit. The alliances inhabiting this regions were protected by Legacy-Coalition for a "small fee" of 300 Billion ISK. After being publicly shamed and exposed, KWGs main Corporation merged into TEST.
---
yeah, RvB is still active. and the recruiting is going very well. the active member count has basically tripled in the past two months. great time to join and a bunch of friendly kickass people to enjoy it with!
---
So if u are not 100% sure u will not pick the fight? :D
---
PVE player cant be 100% sure, but PVP player must to pick a fight thats so nice. :D
---
Well, not useless but its not the same no. But I think we both know that it was a semi big fight.
---
Never
---
It's on screen for a tiny period of time. And you do get systems with no signatures, so...
---
Please explain to me. Give me real examples pertaining to this situation.
---
yep part of the thing that makes it such a fun corp is our awesome FCs who know black rise inside and out and know when/where to setup awesome battles.
---
much like nobody respects the carcass that is pl 2019?

---
Im with you, it shouldnt get removed. Like at all. Its one of the dumbest suggestions Ive heard in a long time.
---
Lol you ethier dont understand anything in this game or are so blinded by something
---
Or if they stopped feeding most of the fleet every time they undocked.
---
90% of the time, a small gang or solo hunter will immediately fuck off of a ratter when reinforcements come in to gather intel before making further decisions. It just doesn't make sense to fight an enemy on their home turf with all the advantages that come with that, AND allow them the information advantage.

Just because you, your 5 reddit alts, and your BB discord you share reddit thread links in, \~downvote\~ my posts doesn't change the fact that your ideas are still shit and lack any forethought and that this whole thing was implemented carelessly and half assed.
---
&gt; Go create more blackout rage threads. 
---
Lol wut? Are you talking about those threads where I was posting both against and for the same idea yet you still got honey potted in them? Also it looks more like CCP rained down on your ability to do anything at all - give it another month and you might accidently expose yourself for being the terribly shitty EVE player we knew you were all along! :D
---
Any proteus build should have a recycling fee attached, as they explode so fast and reliable. Reduce waste!
---
pods are still a much more dependable data point than ships you dumb shit
---
Local - primary source of everybody's intel  
---
VNI - most OP cruiser in the game for semi afk ratting and botting before the changes  
---
Alpha changes - Drones were doing higher damage than any other weapon system. nice balance change.  
---
Market Taxes - take more isk from everyone and maybe move people away from the main trade hubs. now everyone has to consider options instead of jita being a monopoly.  
---
there, i fixed it from your salty narrow perspective.
---
hey guy
---
You got away, put I killed and podded your friend
---
That, and that it's on the border of 2 other regions.
---
Could you share those numbers?
---
Rorq mining ist an activity you can do with multiple accounts at the same time and also for way longer then carrier ratting. You need almost No inputs per Account and can watch a series or do other things while mining.
---
No, if I'm 100% sure I'm going to lose I'm not taking the fight. That only makes sense.
---
Yes, the PvP player generally has the advantage of choosing to fight. But the PvP player is aiming to kill the PvE player, while the PvE player has the much easier job of either running or forcing the PvP player off.
---
where people complain about modules they never use...
---
I see a Stainguy post, I upvote... gotta appreciate the simplicity of life.

fucking 31D chess right there
---
CCP are only interested in the daily login numbers hence the log in for 5 min and get free SP giveaway.
---
Thats stupid?
---
Then dont fight those people.
---
No they dont. Carriers are made in mind to do just that, fight subs. 
---
They are not overpowered. At all. They rock a bit higher DPS than most battleships. Their tracking is fairly shit nowadays. And their fighters die easy, which are their only weapons.
---
No it doesnt. Most fights are subcaps. Stop selling the stupid narrative that caps dominate PvP. It doesnt. The majority of fights are sub vs subs. No matter how much you lie about it dude.
---
Thats why Skillu won the east? With more caps?
---
By no means does more caps mean a win. Again, you are talking shit. Caps dont get deployed in every big sov fight, in fact they rarely get deployed at all. Perhaps try to actually live in NS before spouting of so much shit dude. Its so clear that you dont actually know any of the things youre talking off. And Im no expert, by no means, but I have been in both subs and caps enough to know how it usually plays out.
---
And its sure as shit not the way you are presenting it.
---
I'll agree on battleship and battlecruiser warp speed increase. Those pigs travel so slow that it's atrocious to roam in one these days.   
---
However I feel like rest of the ships are in pretty much ok state, it adds it's own flavor when ships can't just zoom around the solar system but instead you gotta clench your butt when waiting for that secondary point.
---
Hey you stole mah artworks ☹️
---
Of course they have, still got the bots though.
---
Sorry :(
---
Now now. PL has active players.
---
True they are the remnants of MC. Keeping the PL corpse alive Weekend at Bernies style but still. Credit where credit is due when the going got tough for PL they escalated past the temp blue phase and just asked active Coeps and alliances Alliance to become PL to keep the name alive.
---
Then instead of targeting the weak, maybe they should look for other folks that are out roaming and shoot them?
---
If you are looking for an alternative way to grind the ISK and Ores for a Titan build in 2-3 days with your own Accounts alone ... there is none without Rorqual-Multiboxing ... and there should be none.
---
If you are looking for a way to earn the ISK to PLEX 1 Account and and have some 2-3 Bil pocket money per month with just a few hours investment, there are plenty.
---
- Burner Missions
---
- Level5 Missions

---
Haha enjoy being blue to half of eve whatever side you nullsec tards are on
---
No its not. They should change it fighter ui which requires more input and up the isk by a bit. 
---
And the majority doesnt have that many rorqs, just another myth on this sub. But some do have alot, some.
---
I still dont understand why people want to evict active wh corps who give fights. Dead corps, or ones who dock up everytime a group rolls in, fine.  But corps that actually fight? Seems stupid to me. Especially when those same people complain that wh space is dead. *shrugs*
---
To be fair, the ability to pull different alt corps to each wardec will completely ruin any plans of coalition level fleets.
---
Perhaps there is too many alliances withing coalitions and they should just all merge into one.
---
Dropping [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpOMc9ysuek) old gem here again, that's the only way it should look and work, fight me IRL.

Excellent idea. Gobbins should invite GOTG, TRI and Volta. They can invade Esoteria by attacking tenerifis first.  
---

---
How are you doubling or tripling it? I mean in any way that wouldnt require you to cut yourself on a daily basis.
---
Hahahaha oh yes this is SOOO funny! lol 😋😝😝😝
---
Drone Interfacing is also important.
---
No moron, Im talking about seperating people from their groups in order to attack a superior force with an inferior force. Get a clue.
---
I imagine that is exactly what they are doing?
---
Hello, fellow kids!
---
I never said anything about miners, mind you. Actual krabs (and bots) are the cancer tanking the value of the ISK and driving the PLEX sky high.
---
😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹 LOVE IT !!!! 😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹
---
Its been nerfed. Your numbers are correct.
---
Fucking risk-averse krabs everywhere, man.
---
Who needs to warp when you can cyno.
---
I don't get it: what's special about Tikkirei and what do you mean by perfect conditions? Aren't all wormhole sites consistent with each other? Honest question btw, I legit don't know much on the subject, but I've been thinking about trying that out for some time now.
---
I am far from an expert, but starting with producing doctrine hulls is quite straight forward and only necessitate ore and minerals.
---
That should give you a nice entry!
---
Are you actually asking what the difference is between a bot and a person? Or are you trying to make some edgy point?
---
I'm generally very open to CCP events and all, but this seems a little bit...silly.
---
&gt;Breaking news
---
That's been in works for more than a year now, lol.
---
The only part that is shocking is that Noraus said something. Last time I've checked he disappeared after his paid FCs started feeding.
---
As it fucking should be.  Mobile sites are fucking cancer.
---
Having stabs in your qual isn’t a bad idea. Some nerds tackled my poor innocent qual last weekend and I moonwalked out before their FPS arrived by fitting two stabs. 
---
Just didn’t work for this poor fella. Also. Death to all rorquals.
---
Mining doesn't create ISK out of thin air like for example anom ratting does so it doesn't create massive inflation. No new isk is being injected into the economy
---
"so that we can purple fleet and all fire at the same war targets."  
---
Yes, so it's R&amp;B not RvB.
---
Hai. I started to play eve, I get it but I don't. Halp.
---
This event will be rife with controversy.
---
Yes
---
I was watching 3 frat rorqs ratting (yes I mean ratting) in TKE 
---
 under Horde's umbrella the other day. I have to say it was stupefying. I still don't understand it.
---
Tikki's been turbokrabbing for ages and has it down to a science.
---
If you want to run a green anom, you *can* just warp to 0 at the anom, siege, and start shooting. It'll take you forever: you'll have to keep switching ammo, your webs wont web what they need to and your TPs wont apply perfectly. Plus the Avengers are going to be very far from you and slowboat in, so you'll be shooting on the far edge of falloff.
---
Instead what you want to do is set up warpins to where you are perfectly set up to one or two shot the battleships, the third dread is using his capital guns on the avengers, and your smartbombs are overlapping the frigates. This is the difference between a 1 cycle and a 4 cycle, with most people doing it in 2-3 cycles. Watch his video, he goes over warpins and bookmarks. That stuff takes time, along with rolling holes and so on..
---
Mining Drones, Mining Drone Specialization, Drone Interfacing all at 5?
---
You conveniently left out that HC and Odins had HOSA in there aswell, and their total number of pilots was just as many as Baguettes+Allies.
---
They had piss poor hole control and a shitty comp.
---
They came, threw down a Rait, then promptly docked in it and logged off as soon as Baguettes shown resistance. Haha fucking French plebs!!!!
---
Read 'moreover' so many times it doesn't even sound like a word anymore.
---
We used to have ISK sinks all over the place like the old paying to update your clone. While people saw it as annoying it was an ISK sink to use the relay everytime you died to transfer your consciousness.
---
&gt; No moron, I'm talking about seperating people from their groups in order to attack a superior force with an inferior force. Get a clue.
---
No, moron. You're talking about isolating a weak target so you can kill it off and GTFO before you face meaningful opposition that could fight back. If you weren't concerned about getting out before assistance could arrive so the target might either survive or be able to fight back, you wouldn't be posting in this thread. Get a clue.
---
In fact, I'm not even sure you're talking about isolating a weak target yourself. You're probably just hoping to find one that's already isolated.
---
then maybe PL should stop coming to every one of your fights

zkill- facts say kills have risen since blackout (take the educated post from suitonia with good math, not the concern troll), combined with a little less accounts logging in (afk-multibox-farms) it says that activity in total has increased and in relation to logged in accounts even more ...
---
We've got a few things anchored in hi sec.

Hit the nail on the head. Low sec roaming and getting paid for it through LP.

Shhhhhhh don't ruin their narrative.

I should do a speed check to see when the first post bitching about this event is posted from the time Intigo posted this thread.

Fastest warp speed is actually self-destructing your pod.

Hi,
---
Got a new 144hz computer, all games go past 60 fps etc, but Eve is capping out at 60. 
---
I run in windowed mode, i made sure to check gsync settings to ensure it covers the windowed mode.
---
Wut do?
---
Sounds like the big mean space man touched your ship before your friends could arrive and now you're mad about it. 
---
Nah, i read of Goon and Test FCs complaining about lacking content, because they have to go 30 jumps to find a non blue, and then these fags don't want to fight their 100-T3D-Smallscale-Roam with their cowardish 5-Man-Nano-Gang ...
---
Yeah, no.
---
Remove the auto-reactivation on the Excavator mining cycle.
---
Titan going poof? Yeah, no. Even I think this is going waaay overboard. 
---
Have them start lose structure, and bring back repair bills on citadels for caps to the isk sick, this is at least more believable.
---
* lvl 4 missions may have guides several years old... but they really haven't changed much. 99% of them haven't changed in the past 6 years and there's some mission that probably haven't changed in over 10 years. The information you find in the mission guides is still accurate today.
---
* exploration is viable, since it's kind of not multiboxable by default.
---
* incursions still exist, even if they've become less common due to triglavian invasions taking center stage.
---
* said triglavian invasions may also be worth looking into for loot (though it's mostly salvage and it's not solo content)
---
* abyssal deadspace is worth looking into for isk. It is solo, but it can be risky.
---
The fight in question... Suck it Silver

Thanks for your answer. So yeah I watched the video several times now and I noticed the hard part is making the correct bookmarks, but the fact that he shows them in his video helps a lot, and I assumed it was possible to just learn the correct spot to bm in a few hours of dedicated time. Is there more intricacies to this than what I'm seeing?

Guess PanFam would rather have bots running rampant across the New Eden cluster rather than getting rid of the FRT problem.

Yes because last I looked it was barghs and ravens for the poors, which they already used once

The "fight" for the armor timer of the main timer was  60 defender (+3 faxes) vs 62 attackers (+15/20 guardians)  [https://zkillboard.com/related/31001556/201907282000/](https://zkillboard.com/related/31001556/201907282000/)   
---
After the attackers bailed out, we took hole control and more pods came to help the defenders, hence the 120 toons

&gt;I'm amazed at how much free isk it is

Please don't fall into this trap. PI is a silly convoluted thing, if you're doing it you're spending a not insignificant amount of time fighting the UI and later on you have to move goods at risk to your own ship. Saying it is free is akin to mining and saying "the minerals i mine are free" - you get isk as payment for your time invested and you should see it as such.
---
Not really, just hope you dont bump when sieging. You should give hobodreading a try. Do it with two dreads and a DST toon, its chill and easy isk.
---
LZHX is here because?
---
Try again, because it sounds more like I'm suggesting that time-to-gank a weak target should not be a consideration when balancing gameplay elements.
---
That’s my secret. I always suck in fights.
---
It was really nice picture tbh
---
I'm trying to decide if this would improve or further harm an already mostly dead part of New Eden (lowsec). The change alone without other changes i think would do harm i think.
---
context? please tell me this was after 20 titans boson'd a velator or something
---
I’d like to petition for the removal of his rights to bold text.
---
Sorry for not whelping into your fleet of capitals
---
This wh bushido shit is a myth. Every big wh group will fuck over anything for the zkill stats or isk. Nothing different than null groups.
---
I only with this meant that they planned on reverting how sigs show in space. I long for the days where exploration actually involved looking for sigs, rather than having them shout MARCO! to all in the system.
---
That said, I'm sure this is just a lazy "This is what probes look like" demo.
---
My killboard says that’s also my secret, maybe it’s a super power?
---
"Do It in a kestrel!" lol
---
 You still don't get it don't you? :) This kind of attitude brought you in this particular spot. You got cocky, pissed off the wrong kind of people as a result you got stomped and lost your home along with months of work, citadels, cap ships and tens of billions in juicy loot (which by the way we thank you for - DO YOU THINK THE DROP COVERS THE COMBINED LOSSES?).
---
We can actually insta replace our losses no matter how high they are. Can you? [https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99002974/reset/group/902/losses/](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99002974/reset/group/902/losses/)
---
More importantly Vendetta is not just a name. It is OUR way of playing Eve. We are a bunch of mean and vial shitlords, we scheme and plot, we have lots of patience to wait for the decisive moment and we do not hit people for fun. We always go for the jugular. Our hits are meant to kill swiftly and decisively. You have experienced it first hand. It is a lesson you will not forget anytime soon.
---
My advice (for the simple fact that you fought well and I do respect that) find a way, and I'd suggest diplomacy, to shake off the big target that you have on your back now (the beef is not only with VMG). Continue with shitty remarks and stupid things in game or even look at VMG and allies in a funny way and you are in for round two. We are more than willing to wait months or even more until you rebuild and we will hit you again, harder this time. Do you want that to happen again?
---
You know what's interesting? I've actually been recently talking to some of the devs and people at CCP, and they ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAME. I just think that sometimes they spend the time for the looks, rather than accuracy.
---
Honestly the blackout has done nothing but restrict content to densely packed regions. 
---
I have been roaming around up north in US tz. And the only.things I have been able to find are triple stab ishtars. And when I say triple stab ishtars I mean like 3 of them. 
---
So for me anyways, I literally have two options if I want to solo roam in US tz. Go to Horde or Test space, that's literally it.
---
Yeah, it's shitty their fleet F1 bots aren't ready yet.
---
&gt;Even if they podded **you** and scooped **your** corpse
---
^(Bonus points if you open a contract to sell them their corpse)
---
You definitely helped more then hurt.  You killed a bunch of frat entosis.
---
However, you've interfered with objectives several times.
---
When you randomly kill a Tristan or two, we have to treat you as a threat.  Which means not starting entosis on nodes until we know we can defend from you.
---
And losing that tristan reinforcing an ihub in overtime really hurt.
---
Two and a half party was about right.
---
Why try to evict someone then complain when they don't want their main fort to be destroyed? Is this the wormholer equivalent of spodbrain we're seeing here?
---
Maybe if you brought a less shitty comp and actually had something resembling hole control things would have gone better. "Guys lets bring a brawling Leshak comp with 20 guardians when they have enough caps to alpha anything 3x over" Real big brain plays right there.
---
My man!
---
The funny part is he missed the part where hosa were also there and defenders were equal numbers to the attackers but with hosa and HC being so bad they ran away again .
---
Bout the only good thing there good at in Eve
---
Don't send a rabbit to kill a fox
---
It is not so that the rest of your computer or smartphone dont spy.... it is just another company with that info that dont wanna pay 500$  to know what you like or not
---
Even using T2 drones, a Rorq can nearly outmine my three procs and porp. I've considered replacing the porp with a rorq in a couple of months to nearly double my yield per hour.
---
its more like 1 v 3
---
You have to be one of the most retarded SOL guys i've seen in a while holy shit.
---
EVE was always ganks 95% of the time
---
Used to mine 400m per hour
---
Good time
---
Is nobody going to talk about the "Anyone want to 1v12 at the bottom"? Cause that's hilarious.
---
Ahh it's you again. How's the old folk's home treating you?
---
I'll go with : "what is actually going on for 500$ alex!"
---
Additional bonus if you deliver it to their citadel before contracting it to them.
---
Bob is pleased by our efforts.
---
Who are you?
---
the thing is with rorq, is the richer you are the bigger the income is, you need a lot of investment for a complete 20+ rorq setup ( something like 6 month of training + 7bil ~ per rorq) so the richer get richer and the poor get poorer, it is a good mechanic for "medium size" player with 20+ bil isk to grow pretty fast (that's how I become a simple carrier pilot to a titan pilot+ supers pilot within a few months) but the poor guy will struggle with people who can afford 50 rorq and build a titan in an hour
---
Once again, CCP thinks a palette swap is worth 30 bucks.  These tards still don't understand the term "Micro'transaction".   News at 11.
---
About as many people who can't read.
---
I said specifically that the ability to massage the good AND BAD stats was desired.  At the very least let me make something remotely useful even with an absolutely terrible roll otherwise.
---
It is not fun in any sense to end up with contract garbage.
---
Praise Bob!
---
This is about the Impoc given back to the Amarr empire, I want it back in player hands.
---
&gt; I am asking why you think it is objectively reasonable from a balance standpoint why the largest ships in the game should be the fastest.
---
Where do you stand on that?
---
&gt;They are not overpowered. At all. They rock a bit higher DPS than most battleships. Their tracking is fairly shit nowadays. And their fighters die easy, which are their only weapons.
---
It is the speed they can move at that is the main problem.
---
I have not played EVE in awhile due to IRL reasons, but there's always some driving force behind it.   whether it's loot pinata, someone talked shit in local and now their their ass is in their mouth,  or  they just piss off someone by constantly blobbing or something like.
---
Don't know what X877 did.    I know people had have problems with them before.   Not gonna get my head mixed in this shit either
---
No. it will not. a removal of asset safety barely hurts any small or medium size alliance. an alliance at that size knows who their jump freighter/logi boiz are and can and will get their shit out safely. and they will gain FAR more in terms of possible profit from bigger alliances.  
---
no. it will not stop forward deployments. you can shit out as many raitaru's as you'd like, making weeding you out a painful process. and unlike the average mega-coalition member, small alliances dont have hangars full of ships and crap. you bring what you not. not every little thing. your hangar doesnt have to look like a fucking garage sale. and even in the worst case. once again you've got your well known alliance logi boiz to get out the important shit, and try again.  
---
People ARE looking for a removal (or loosening of) asset safety. for damn good reasons too. it provides nothing for those "Small alliances" to hit and profit from. nothing to viably engage as even if they went on a mass crusade to try and wipe out the horde of citadels from a coalition, that coalition dont even give a fuck. it'll either turbofuck them on day one. or just not give a shit and place 50 citadels later just cause there no reason not to.  
---
The attacker has gained nothing but a useless painful grind with not even the slightest hope of a few copper pennies at the end of the rainbow.  
---
wreck IRL stuff? im sorry that a modicum of risk from you putting all eggs in one basket is a risk. spread shit out or export/sell the things you dont need. this is something small alliances with more than two braincells will recognise.  
---
Your in nullsec. this isnt the fucking kiddy pool. if you cant take it. get out. im sure highsec will love you.  
---
Eve as it is, will be the thing that completely kills small/medium alliances. not a change that makes you have to do even the minimum of fucking work to protect yo shit.
---
&gt; very little real risk.
---
Outside of Delve, Eso and a couple other places, I imagine using a rorq is still pretty risky. OANIC is the problem. But to remove that, excavs should be made far cheaper. Nobody wants to mine in what amounts to a jumpfreighter.
---
There is a post on /r/eve frontage right now about how TEST is having so much more fun fighting gangs like Tusker in Esoteria. Legacy is also in the middle of a war. I don't know what TEST FC's are complaining about lack of contact, but it sounds made up.
---
Im fairly certain that on the Chaos server (and SiSi too I believe) that anoms don't spawn in systems that loaded recently. On the test servers, they don't have enough nodes to keep all the constellations running. Ergo when you jump or to into a new system, it takes a few seconds for it to spin up, and they seem to have anoms turned off
---
I mean, evict all c4 corps unless they move to c5
---
If you don't respect what goons have managed to build then you're a new player or an idiot, lol
---
&gt;It is not so that the rest of your computer or smartphone dont spy....
---
They are very different. As for the former, no. The latter can be a problem, but not much of importance happens there because of the spyware.
---
It is good that you admit discord is spyware.
---
Hk pet obviously
---
Don't you know how this works?
---
hehehehe yeeeeeeees engage the rage  
---
Yes the comp was shit.  
---
Yes USTZ hole control was problematic.   
---
Lessons learned.  
---
The frenchies still suck
---
What if your roll is destined to be all-negative? Or you want to completely remove that risk too?
---
You are going to have shit rolls, and you are going to have god-tier rolls. Deal with the risk if you want a good mod.
---
For a group that habitually don't give fights we do seem to have a lot of them.

so how much in caldari standing reduces what exactly for how much %? thank you

The bigger question is why Odins is there ... hmmm
---
Are you OK dude ? You were supposed to say "but it was just a content Astrahus, we never meant to evict you, so we didn't fail"
---
Felix you're a good man, and while pospy has some good people I can't even recall the last time you fought us, even tho you have some big numbers. So many rl people

80-100m with excavators and near perfect skills. Mind you, those excavators will probably get nuked in black out. If you are multiboxing, and are part of the majority right now you are using t2 drones. So that's 40-50m an hour.
---
It was an answer from ofoc, when bag8 (at that time still eyes/fr along with rats &amp; fromage) rf a low power fort in one of odin's call farm 10 month ago
---
I wonder what your isk per hour will be after your excavators get bombed
---
thats a nice br with you on the same side as init there the other day, thanks for linking i didnt catch that one
---
Something about not eating where you shit, but I’m not sure which activity corresponds to which in this case.
---
This has been going on since it became clear that goons, owning more supercapitals than the rest of Eve combined, can basically roflstomp anybody with inpunity.
---
They have an active market in their staging. They guy above you is talking out of his ass
---
You still don't get it don't you? :) This kind of attitude brought you in this particular spot. You got cocky, pissed off the wrong kind of people as a result you got stomped and lost your home along with months of work, citadels, cap ships and tens of billions in juicy loot (which by the way we thank you for - DO YOU THINK THE DROP COVERS THE COMBINED LOSSES?).
---
We can actually insta replace our losses no matter how high they are. Can you? https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99002974/reset/group/902/losses/
---
Yeah sure, start reinforcing our main citadel. OF COURSE WE ARE GOING TO BATPHONE THE EVERLIVING SHIT OUT OF EVERYONE.
---
Oh and we only batphoned tdsin and DEQC. init was never involved.
---
They then decided to start reinforcing our main citadel. Not exactly something you do randomly
---
man these guys are salty that you are correct
---
You are confusing ignoring it with 'i got mad and spend hours posting and talking about it'
---
You are not. You are (or were) coming front the point of view that Blackout has somehow evaporated content.
---
And the overwhelming majority of people seem to disagree with you.
---
That said, if you are in a big blue bloc, which you seldom leave and fight in larger fleet comps, you may well be suffering a bit.
---
But you should at least acknowledge that the effect of Blackout might just be negative for your personal circumstances, rather than the whole game being ruined for everyone.
---
Stop calling me a good man and my corp shit. You say that exact line every damn time. either acknowledge me as the same shit you describe my corp as or start calling my corp with the same respect you give me.
---
1) Sort by best  
---
2) Read the comment under the first
---
You... really don't get what I'm saying.  I don't want to remove risk at all!  I want the ability to assign the roll in some capacity to minimize the damage.  What that might look like is take a small hit to useful attributes, but tank the powergrid usage for fits that have power grid for days.  This at least makes the module somewhat still useful, even with a fully negative roll.  Conversely, you can chain the attributes to each other such that boosting a useful stat too high horribly gimps everything else to compensate.
---
I just want to reduce the rng bricking and make it more of a game, you know, fun?
---
No, it would hurt balance of different ship sizes and increase power projection ridiculously.
---
Omist was not even proper renting space for most of that though. They paid everyone within 5 regions to be blue. I also don't see how it is Legacys responsibility to police people we did not even consider as proper renters. If you think KWG was bad, you will surely admit that FRAT is many times worse, since their direct renters living under the same sov as the main FRAT alliance, and bearing the same name, have had FAR more bots banned. 
---
https://twitter.com/CCP_Peligro/status/1126496159407792128 
---
As you can see, after all those years, including many before Stainwaggon was evicted, KWG has 2% of the permabans on that chart. FRAT treasury, while only being a year old, has 5%. Clearly Legacy is not the biggest botting group. Many of the renting groups on there have nothing at all to do with Legacy.
---
One init person. wow
---
Yup. A whole lotta death went down last July
---
i guess you missed the part of the br where you turned up to defend the structure of one of the people who set up the rage eviction :)
---
Wow hard choice, who do i dislike more ... the french wh-peeps or the highsec-wardec-wh-wannabe groups ... 
---
Frenchies at least have some good food ...
---
Oh, "high-class" salt.
---
TEST does not tolerate bots. If you find any bots in TEST or our renters, please send evidence to Cornak Firefist and Dran Arcana. They will be kicked as soon as it is proven they are bots.
---
And which side did we fight on in the rage eviction if i may ask?
---
you know what they say right, gotta pretend to be on our side when in reality youre stabbing in the back!
---
I mean... there's  maybe two proper fights there : /
---
It just was a fight in Amamake. No titans.
---
The fuck has happened in jspace since I left?
---
It's actually" 1v1?"
---
Poor cropping, he asked for a frig 1v1
---
Keep rowing mate. We did our damn best to help and you know it.
---
Gotg are full of bots these days it should be renamed GOTB
---
Its like hfgl in Starcraft. You may not care whether they have fun nor wish upon any glimpse of fortune on their performance, but it's what we do. A tradition of being courteous? Nothing wrong with that.
---
Must've missed the part where most of J-Space was lowkey rooting for INIT.
---
Sucks when there are people out there who don't want all of J-Space to be the personal krabbing grounds of three corps and their pets, the attempted eviction of BAG8 was even over krabs getting mad about BAG8 fucking with their krabbing.
---
Great, I'll check that out, thank you!
---
i guess we will have to disagree, looking forward to our 1 fight a year vs your group!
---
And the next day a new faceroll name will appear in en-pl in a nyx, we both know how this works.
---
i was looking at this post and then my brother came and we looked at it together. He said this post really changed his life and it touched my heart. Me and all wormhole people are so grateful. Am proud to say cool post wow thanks for sharing
---
thanks random nobody too worried to post on their main lmao
---
Hit them at the perfect moment while they are ratting and use the rats dps to help you.
---
Oh sorry, you misunderstood, i red that ... but they simply don't belong in the LZX, HK class group ... they usually fight on the wrong side.
---
HK only tickles to get a fight ... HC/HOSA/Odins evict for the eviction purpose ... ;)
---
You are aware by definition the null bloc is the majority which makes you the overwhelming minority lmao youre just more vocal. Shits fucked across the board outside of ganking. Ive argued this to death and youre not going to begin to pretend to be honest through this so ill give it to you bluntly. 
---
Pre-blackout - content for everyone and anyone who looked for it
---
Post-blackout - content only for the smallest of gangs
---
And if you think thats somehow healthier boy do you not want this game to last
---
True but we still try to fight. The thing is that whenever we are mentioned we got this guy saying ''eh you guys dont fight''
---
gets rather annoying after a while.
---
Don't have a "main" on Reddit, I just lurk and made an account one time to post a funny.
---
We don't all have to come on here to moralepost constantly.
---
I can't join the discord, the link does not work.
---
I used to be a part of a group that (mostly legitimately) did this, but I don't know any current ones that aren't scams. We didn't offer evictions and pocos because :effort: but we'd scan you into anywhere.
---
&gt; whataboutism
---
Shouldn't you be working on your CP defense, Mr Jones?
---
Could someone explain to me how multiboxing miners scales upward?  To me it seems like it'd be a flat amount of mining per account until they get Plex.  After that yes it's all profit that can get funneled to one character but until the Plex time it isn't any better or worse with one miner than 20.  
---
What I mean is, let's assume one miner takes 40 hours to mine enough to Plex.  Now assume you get 10 miners and mine them all.  It still takes 40 hours to Plex your fleet (assuming you mine them all together).  After that point the difference in isk between one and 10 is only because you're funneling isk to one player.  If you kept it on each mining account it wouldn't be any different.
---
Is this correct?
---
I'm not hearing any of that from inside TEST.
---
"Small group pve" 
---
There isnt really any such thing

Story: Caught a random solo moa in Catch, started kiting him to death. He somehow slips tackle (I guess I derped) and warps sun. I go get him. 3 bombers from the same corp decloak and yeet. I ADC and laugh. Laughing too hard to tackle any bombers. Moa and one of the bombers dies to bombs anyway. Bombers still get away as I am at this point pissing myself laughing.
---
Comms were great.
---
"Oh shit he's got friends BOMBS?! Okay..."
---
Fat Elvis Presley I love that
---
You are on the side where you can whore, pospy has been doing nothing lately but team up with other trash ass corps to get a structure or capital killmail. You fight nobody on equal grounds or even remotely equal, dock up and hide your ass in your fortizar you absolute trash.
---
I also think a lot of them are in peoples accounts who were permabanned for the casino shit
---
Y
---
Funny thing is they had that chance at the end of WWB.  TEST were the only ones who deployed to delve.  Panfam refused, and soon after hit CO2/TEST in impass.  TEST left for Esoteria and soon after panfam followed.
---
It wasn't until that point we were forced into an agreement with goons.  Panfam has been crying about it ever since.
---
There are patch notes. There was a dev blog.
---
People have complained for ages that we're not doing enough, that we're not changing enough, that we're too slow to get changes out of the door, that we're letting the game stagnate.
---
Now we start to make rapid changes and all of a sudden it's "REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE you're doing things too fast!"
---
I'm at a loss, really.
---
Pretty sure the bomb worked as intended.
---
Maybe frat muninns melt too fast.
---
That's a one time thing though, with at most temporary changes (as you mentioned; price changes for a week). The giants aren't going to stop being giants and can keep their stranglehold on anything smaller than them permanently if it costs this much to change an order's price. If you're smaller, you can't wait them out and if you try to undercut them you're losing more than they are.
---
90% of people in every single fleet
---
Nah, CCP hilmar is getting his hot tips from the mega coalitions so they will just use their broken insta teleport jump gates.
---
We fielded more pilots to protect rage than HK did if I remember correctly. This narrative your trying to sell has no basis.
---
you guys get rekted there too ?
---
It's been working for me, and has turned Provi from a completely dead region into a funhouse with free ak47s at the door.
---
Cloaky ganking is not all of what's been going on. I've been roaming and fighting in assault frigs, largely because they're cheap and overpowered. I've seen every ship type roaming this madhouse space up to and including supercaps (thanks Third Party for the hilarious 4 way cap fight on Wacky Wednesday I had literally no idea what was going on).
---
Seriously. Come to catch/provi, bring a fastish ship, and have fun. It's no specific TZ, I was cloaky ganking on my day off (okay, yes, I do cloaky pvp sometimes!) and found tons of people.
---
"Easily"
---
yea u right
---
And why is this a problem? Everyone will pay some more, so what?
---
Don't make this about us, we got our own business to mind.
---
How much a Exhumer (Skiff/Mack/Hulk) can mine per hour?
---
Or in m³/s?
---
Baguette here.
---
So some C2 scrubs (odin' bark, hc and hs) tried to get some content by dropping 4 structures and bringing 120pilotes. They did this while most of us french were away on holidays, and it was on purpose. 
---
Thats cool. We can deal with that. 
---
We were even on pilots numbers during the fight, but had maybe 20 toons in the hole when the invade started. Anything more was cause of poor hole control.
---
 We obviously had the cap advantage, but I guess thats the whole point of invading someone ? In the end they ran away, cause they didnt want to risk 1b+ ship for content (thats what they told me at least).
---
They actually had most of their loss before the fight, as they were surprisingly underperfoming against kitey stuff. 
---
Anyway, good fight, we know you can bring 500 people in raven, but please dont say you come for content and goodfight when you can't engage without outnumbering. 
---
I've been in eyes.fr then baguette, we never saw holesale in whspace except for eviction, and never fought HC without being largely outnumbered. 
---
Odin's bark was a bit of a deception as we always liked them.
---
Anyway, good fight, we know you can bring 500 people in raven, but please dont say you come for content and goodfight when you never really engage while not outnumbering us.
---
Aaron M.
---
That is pretty funny tbf. Y'all should find a new name for your newbros tho, if you're not gonna sound like a horde altcorp anymore. What's a baby waffle? Batter? Hmm.
---
 Nobody should be able to make any amount of isk/hour according to this sub. W/e the number it will always be “bad” due to multiboxing. CCP should be selling it for $ instead.
---
Come to TDF, we make 200/hr minimum and we always beat you guys in contests 😉
---
Saw this a bit in Ansoo but after checking char creation dates it was someone using an illegal char exploit and it was 3 different cloaky campers.
---
Well you sure as fuck got the title right.
---
They did announce it.
---
can you explain why you turned up to defend the structure of someone who set up the rage eviction then? if i remember correctly he was actually kicked from pospy?
---
genuine question btw, i dont hate you guys or anything and i am not one for "narrative spinning" but im sure you can see from our point of view how the relationship is very strange, especially when the fortizars in rage were allowing pospy people to tether on them, for example https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/421686635097358337/525938000727769088/unknown.png
---
plz respond!
---
You’ve obviously never been to null space and spent time there
---
This is why adding 1.000.000 isk to each build cruiser will balance the stuff.      
---
The richer (better ships you fly) the more you add to this sink.

Someone in titan -&gt; 10bil.           
---
Fair and simple.
---
can you read? it clearly says they deny such thing
---
If you try to please everyone, you end up pleasing nobody. Don't pay attention to these salt miners please, I love these changes and I'm curious to see what they will do to the game!
---
Agreed. Just don't get into a big bloc, find a newbro friendly small gang corp. Actually learn to pvp, and fly your ship, whether that's suicide ganking, faction war, nullsec, or wormhole space, there's pvp everywhere and it all matters. :)
---
Test flair please ignore.
---
No because you are punishing players that don't play for various reasons.
---
Jspace
---
I remember that Pospy was there to help you. I was privy to discussions between several wg corps about whether to help the wh assholes hk over a null alliance. We all decided it would be best to help because we didn't want that bad precedent.
---
Pospy decided similarly. Lots of wh groups went to help you.
---
While it's true that some pospy people had a role in the eviction, I don't think it was their upper echelon deciding this. It was most likely init spies using pospy's name to freight on everything over a year. But pospy really did show up to defend you guys.
---
this guy doesn't multibox
---
Yes.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
^(^^as ^^in: ^^whatever ^^you ^^do, ^^someone ^^will ^^complain)
---
Sorry, what I meant to say is "making it **quicker** to find fights"
---
If having fun is your goal then you should sign up for one of the newbie friendly nullsec alliance corps (Brand Newbros, karmafleet, pandemic horde, think there's a couple others but these are the best ones. The first two are highly organized and the middle one is filthy rich, the third will accept your application in hours (sometimes minutes)). 
---
They will give you free frigates and other jazz because you're more valuable as asses in captain's chairs than the low isk value of some frigates and t1 cruisers. Its possible to partake in every fleet and never have to grind a single isk, just remember to install whatever comms and chat system they use so you get the ping when a fleet is forming.  They also have TONS of resources for learning, just don't try to learn it all in a very short time, that's like doing all 13 years or so of basic school in a couple weeks. It doesn't really matter if you fly perfectly (or even decently), because you're more useful as a bumbling baboon on the battlefield, than someone who didn't show up. Just don't show up for too many fleets, then you'll burn out (there tends to be some fighting outside your prime timezone, just go easy on those no matter how important the top (br)ass says it is). 
---
PS: I really  mean it when I say dying doesn't matter, the game lore is literally that you are a capsuleer, who's consciousness transfers to a fresh clone every time death occurs. The only time dying is bad is if you can't afford to replace the ship you lost (or aren't elligble for Ship Replacement Program (SRP) because you did a major booboo like jumping through a gate when the FC said not to do it)). Nowhere is safe, people can kill you everywhere, even in highsec, so don't put all your eggs in one basket and undock in that basket.
---
&gt;Nobody will be helping next time you guys are in the shit.
---
literally the same amount of people will help them if not more, you know fuck all about jspace politics
---
quick reminder that the first eviction was planned 15 years ahead after rolling 3,5 thousand C6 wormholes just to find Rage and seed the 45 freighters so i wouldn't be worried too much
---
good question :D
---
Wow strong loyalty they're, Felix! :)
---
I left null recently and went back to low and high for the smaller scale stuff. Mining is extremely risky and not very valuable compared to highsec or even mission pocket ded site mining in high. PvP usually results in cap drops so it's not much of an escape from null. Exploration in low is very trash too.
---
I don't know what is needed exactly but something.
---
If I follow the propaganda trend here...
---
Anything good about blackout = upvote
---
Anything bad about blackout = downvote
---
Anything else = downvote
---
That you are at a loss, does not surprise me. If you have time to read all this shit here means you are not working.
---
If this war didn't turn Detorid into dead-orid and make it completely boring to roam I'd be cheering for this shit. Bonus points for being completely inactive in my TZ.
---
Actually in many BPO you have "extra materials".         
---
Simply to say this material is used during production and you cannot get it back during reprocessing.         
---
Imagine yourself that this is { fee, license, wages for the workforce, crew cost}  to build some ship.
---
~Every pvp player ever
---
So we have CCP's numbers a couple posts up, and a third party google doc that redscreens on my box.
---
Which one am I believing.
---
You've got a duplicate sentence in there bud
---
How to multibox
---
Any complaints about finding content or not wanting to be dropped on by supers will be downvoted
---
Let's see how long gobbins can play nice with the other kids this time.
---
I'm curious, let's say I wanted to kill a Nyx with 3 bros, what ships should they use?
---
You won't see too many TAPI people hopping at that idea again. We have seen how this plays out a few times already.
---
Actually it was planned not 15 years before but actually during eve beta get your fucken facts right
---
You know what is funny? That Gobbins pull the strings that Vince and Hedliner have attached.       
---
NCPL became PH pets now.
---
It is kind of funny how multiboxing is called out as part of the problem but never questioned when sb suggests an answer.
---
The event is a waste of time one person will get the perfect setup and keep winning it with the exact same strategy over and over cant be bothered to even take part.
---
Compared to multi boxing carriers?
---
Edited, thanks
---
If, moving forward, the only constant is change then EVE will be way better for it. 
---
Especially for unscrupulous market traders like yourself: Perfect information enables perfect competition, instability and imperfect information enable market opportunities!
---
You do realize that it's literally part of my job to read this subreddit, right?
---
Jesus Christ, lol
---
P A N D A F A M
---
For a quite long i people are asking for the Lowsec Gate To Stain (LGTS)      
---
Based on this post - when we can expect it.           
---
BTW nice job with this Tax isk sink, have you read my post about additional industrial taxation btw?
---
Don't worry about the big null blocs, it's not all of eve. Make friends and learn, but you don't have to ship out to null.
---
Regarding rep - not really. Missioning is only one part of this game, you can fix empire standings for isk, and pirate standings by grinding your ass off if you want to get into pirate faction missions. They're pretty profitable, but take place in NPC nullsec so are quite dangerous. Or at least dangeresque.
---
This contest is dumb. It's been designed by someone who wants to garner attention to the game but does not actually play it himself, at least not in any serious capacity. The only winner here is CCP with free tweet advertisement about an event that seems interesting to new/non-players but isn't at all to the vast majority of current players.
---
The contest is massively tipped towards rich elite veterans. No new player has any hope of actually getting close to winning and collecting any kind of prize. To win this you need, at a minimum: a second account, a citadel just off-grid on a belt with the undock pointing the right direction, a high-grade ascendancy pod, a t1f with hyper rigs hyper lows, either smartbombs or faction sebos+arty or some such, and a buncha skills maxed. Warp to the belt with an alt, wait for rats to appear and prep it by putting it in low structure, undock contest runner warp to alt instagib the rat.
---
You're looking at a ~5b investment to potentially maybe possibly collect 3 injectors worth of SP. And that's just what I'm thinking of off the top of my head, I'm sure there's more one can do to make the run even faster for even more isk.
---
If you want to create an event for existing players, and not just use players for free advertisement; make something everyone can do with guarantueed rewards. Something as simple as a race across the universe (visit every region) as fast as possible with guarantueed SP rewards that get higher the faster you do it. And then throw on these top5 prizes on top of that. It'd be more interactive for players, allow for more creativity, be more fun and rewarding, and get some content out in the wild that you could kill (and generate salt with).
---
Sansha missions are pretty dank money tbf.
---
Its even more fun to be in a large fleet when you have a local friend also in that fleet, gives you something to talk about down the line. You can always have more than one account and have one character on each. One for solo/duo FW and the other for nullsec pvp where you have fc's and scouts and stuff doing the important bits so you can focus on learning the basics.
---
Gotta bloat those fleet numbers and tank that retention rate baby
---
covetor with low skills and t1 strip is like 11 m3/s per laser
---
Yup, I've read it :)
---
Also, if you eventually get your lowsec gate to Stain, what are you going to do? You'll literally have nothing to talk about any more :P
---
If part of your Job is getting feed back from reddit, that would explain why you guys make such poor decisions latly.
---
keep up the good work, soon you will not have a job any more.
---
I was talking about the turd between your eyes.
---
Laughable, really.
---
I get it.  You want the game to last.  And by the sounds of it, you feel like reinforcing the current null-bloc meta (because that's where everyone is currently grouped up) is the future of Eve? 
---
Any consideration that this could be the cause rather than the cure?
---
No? Provi has been completely dead for the past four months, and I've been getting constant fights there every night since blackout.
---
not really, no.
---
Except it's actually a 3-color pattern, not counting banners and details, and honestly the holos aren't terrible. Perhaps they could be shortened a bit, but meh. Yeah, we've seen better, but these definitely are above average quality. Definitely a whole lot better than that Charon skin from a few weeks ago that was black with red sharpie lines here and there, that looked plain awful.
---
You can always make another account and train another alpha character and do something else with that one.
---
Before blackout they also seemed to only undock when we were reffing stuff. Now I see random CVA gangs and small camps everywhere. No super umbrella = it's a good region for fun.
---
Tbh i will ask you to use the StainGuy (char ingame) turn it to NPC orbiting this gate in a phantasm.    
---
Make it re spawn randomly - so all people can come shoot it and get StainGuy corpse.
---
My wormhole Corp thought it was Good Fuck, not good fight... oops
---
You would have to get passed all the player gate camps between region's which could be interesting lol
---
Yep.      
---
But lets be honest - doing Tier 5 in higsec gets you more in much safer way.
---
The beauty of eve is that even a bumbling baboon on the battlefield is more useful than someone who didn't show up for the battle. So you don't have to worry about being the top 1% in how much you contribute to every engagement.
---
kek
---
If you can't increase tempo without sacrificing quality and/or communication then you have a problem.
---
Blackout doesnt fix the null-bloc meta though it reinforces it. Theres a multitude of other things they can do rather than making space emptier. If you can't comprehend that or are willing to ignore that just because you get off on people who can organise more people to get in a fleet with you then I'm sorry but you're the problem.
---
Because most people on reddit are retarded.
---
Oh, conifers. I've heard legends about how terrible these guys are, but never got the chance to put the to the test. Guess the legends hold some truth after all.
---
L5s take place in lowsec. Still very safe isk tho.
---
The only thing I see on the launcher is the list of my accounts, everything else is off past the edge of my right hand side screen until ad blocker works on the launcher too

---
I have to agree with OP. This is no way to apply changes. Whats next, devblog 1 minute before deployment? CCP needs to THOROUGHLY evaluate and discuss changes with their playerbase. There need to be multiple tests before deployment. Instead, now they're doing to EVE at large what they've been doing to Russian community for years.
---
^^^ so much this lmao. Getting all your feedback from a vocal minority who are convinced everything was bad is dumb
---
this was really good - quick and dirty video, some very close calls that made it a joy to watch

Anyone else sub out GF in local for a question of what you did wrong to explode that time?
---
I wish it was a one time thing. I'm sitting on 40b in a single isotope type due to fire sale extravaganzas and people undercutting who dont know or care it's a firesale.
---
I'm not out of the game but it is annoying as it slows things down.
---
Hilmar said reworked and not removed, big difference. 
---
There are a couple of things that you could do that wouldn't impact small and medium corps too much. 
---
A couple of ideas I've seen mentioned:  
---
1. Asset safety could be a structure module that gives people limited cargo space that has asset safety (could be gamed by using alts, maybe restrict it to omega alts?).  
---
2. The 15% fee to use Asset Safety could be paid to the attacker instead of being an ISK sink.  
---
3. Asset safety could be up to a specific amount of value (so let's say, all items below 500mil are asset safetied), with the goal of making it harder for vets with caps, but easier for newbros.  
---
4. Asset safety could have a loot fairy mechanic, but more than 50% chance. Additionally, you could maybe tie asset safety to how upgraded your system is, so a more upgraded system will have 100% (or near 100%) asset safety, but un-upgraded and unused systems have lower asset safety. You could also tie asset safety to security level, so a 1.0 system has 100% asset safety, a low-sec 0.3 system might have 80% asset safety and a typical null system might have 50%.
---
Some of these ideas are better than others, but I agree with a lot of people on this sub that Asset Safety needs a rework.
---

Currently i don't see any current patch notes, the last patch notes are for June and it's currently (and was yesterday, when the update happened) August; https://www.eveonline.com/articles/patch-notes. There are no patch notes for August (yet? I suppose it is yet to be posted then?)
---
Meanwhile, the launcher looks like this: https://i.imgur.com/DJPzorW.png . There isn't a mention of any dev blog anymore. It's been hidden, as i stated in my OP, 24 hours after it went live. Sure, it still exists, you can find it. But that means the player has to look it up and nobody is going to randomly look up devblogs every time they've stepped away a few days. Something needs to notify the player something changed before that happens.
---
The changes themselves is not why i created this post; the changes and their intended / expected / subjective results is a whole different can of worms other people can discuss in their posts. The reason i created this post is because any information to the players about this change posted *yesterday* is already hidden unless you specifically come to reddit (and that source will vanish in a few days too) or look up past dev blogs (which few people do out of the blue). This is just plain bad communication from a game to its players.
---
Lastly: no offense, but complaining about someone with valid criticism about the way CCP has done something with going "all of a sudden it's REEE" is not really a valid response. Visibly showing changes for people that aren't glued to reddit 24/7 is kind of important, especially (as i mentioned in my original post) during a holiday season where part of the playerbase is basically expected to be gone for a week or more at a time.
---
My biggest suggestion would be to ensure information about changes to long-established mechanics stay visible in the launcher for at least a week or two, or give an ingame message / notification if it's a "hidden" mechanic like the tax numbers. They're there, but they're tiny and everyone has seen them a million times. 
---
Notable changes are kind of expected to have notable visibility. Hiding all mention of it without digging in deeper, such a very short time after the changes, isn't exactly notable visibility.
---
I mean... they put up a dev blog and patch notes ahead of time. That's all that needs to be done, it's up to people to read it or not...
---
Welcome to the age of Chaos. Or did you think only null would be shaken up ?
---
How precisely are you going to test impacts on SISI with no appreciable market volume?
---
Pretty much this^
---
You can do this already
---
[The patch notes are here.] (https://www.eveonline.com/article/ptgdti/patch-notes-for-june-2019-release) The August Release hasn't shipped yet.
---
The most recent patch notes are always at the top, and are sorted by our development branch.
---
TL:DR - Raise costs to build ships.  
---
Also, I think it's not a bad idea to pull isk from the system at all.
---
thanks for the post like i said in another post in this thread i am not one for "narrative spinning" but like you said i think it's very clear that there was some pospy involvement that they are too scared to admit.
---
im sure a lot of the line members were absolutely there to help and had our back, but unfortunately it's pretty obvious that some leadership people felt differently. that's our opinion at least, and it could be wrong.
---
the main thing for me is i dont like being called a "narrative spinner" by some of these pospy guys when i think we have a pretty clear reason to be suspicious about stuff like in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cl2m75/the_c4_crusade_has_begun_dagger_all_the_c4/evsncgv/?context=3) - i dont hate pospy, but i don't think we are exactly narrative spinning either.
---
Do read my post, please. They announced it, on the 29th, and went live without mentioning a date. Today, 5 days later, all mention of the changes has been hidden from the launcher.
---
I don't mind the changes. I mind changes that imply i need to stalk CCP religiously or i might get dicked over by quiet game mechanic changes. I was aware of this in this case, but there will be people currently on holiday who come back this weekend or next week with zero information that anything has changed and they are likely to be burned by an almost invisible change.

---
Artimus "You'd have a point Silver if it wasn't your side which is the 25 biggest corps in the game in this particular instance" LOL dude you hit the nail on the head o7.
---
Nice
---
Thats their selling point. They are rather crap and the reason why they are used is actually because of their capability to do 1 jump that incurs timers to prevent a second jump. That means that even if they can jump long distances its a huge risk since they cant just jump out again.
---
I dont think there is any issue with caps, cyno, supers, umbrellas and so on. At all.
---
I do however think its an issue that small gang needs content that suits them better than trying to fight under an umbrella. But I dont think that people that chose to fight under an umbrella should be pampered with. Its a choice, not something they need to do.
---
And if someone choses to do it, then its on the defenders terms. 
---
But, also, I dont know where you are finding these fights. Thats important to point out. I dont belive caps should be used anywhere in lowsec for instance. Supers/titans should also be heavily restricted in those areas.
---
But in NS, if you have a spool up timer for cynos it will mean those cyno ships will get killed everytime you are trying to fight a big timer. Thats a heavy advantage for the defender. It will just force one to use dozens and dozens of cynos and just make everything more boring and stale.
---
So you understand, the issue is on what level you are trying to balance something. You cant balance for small gang because it will wreck big gang. 
---
These suggestions might have worked five years ago when a balance existed but today, Im sorry dude, its just not that game anymore. 
---
And I dont dislike small gangs, I love that playstyle and I do understand the issues because I face them myself when Im roaming in smaller groups. But I also know you cant balance them out. Things that work for 5 people will seldom work for 500 people. And I dont think its fair that 5 people should get preferential treatment over 500.
---
There's a life lesson to be learned here - no matter what you do, or how you approach it, some idiot will find a reason to complain.

Even if they hadn't jumped with me, because I attacked him before the boosh they were still in drone control range they all aggro'ed him. So they would have still flew over to go pew pew. Just would have taken about 20 seconds extra for the warriors to come in. 
---
For your tactic to work, you would need 3 booshers. At the bare minimum 2. The Rorqual has insane rep range, and each repper on those procurers is about 1.2k HP/s
---
c4 corps always do gay shit because they are degenerates
---
Glen Burney, is that you? :)
---
Fighter UI?  Fucking hell, no.  Unless the goal is to make the game unplayable. 
---
Do you work for Chris Roberts by any chance?
---
This. God, I really wish I could feel like going out in solo nano cruisers again.
---
Why not just buff the total amount an individual Rorq can mine itself by +X%, but then create a negative trait of reducing it's total yield by a smaller % for each additional Rorq on grid.  Thus making a singular Rorq produce a desirable yield, but suffering from diminishing returns for stacking them, until it gets to the point that an additional Rorq will actually cause total yield on grid to be lower than if it wasn't there.
---
I may be wrong but I think the EVE client literally maxes out at 60 fps.
---
Honestly I don't see why you would need more than that, I play at 20 fps on my shitty potato laptop and get by just fine.
---
Okay, this honestly just further troubles things. I just kind of assumed June patch notes meant patch notes for things in June and i imagine most people will.
---
No word on the rest? You've cleared up that there is information to be found if you look things up on the eve online site, but this still means the player needs to look it up without the launcher or game implying something changed.
---
But ^W^^h^^^y^^^^^y^^^^^^^y^^^^^y^^^^^^^^y^^^^^^^^!
---
In what respect is the economy "broken"?  And I'm sure you morons won't be happy until all systems in Eve are actually WH.
---
Rorquals require next to no input and make money while watching Youtube / Netflix. They can be dropped in several Belts or the same and just eat everything in range, once in a while you need to go to another Rock-Asteroid but thats not something to keep active track and requires no actual attention.
---
Carrier or Supercarrier ratting requires a lot of input and active time watching your fighters, you can't loose a single Fighter because each of them is as much ISK in bountys as an entire Sanctum or Haven. Loosing a Squad against a Dreadspawn is like loosing your last hour depending on your ticks (80-100mil ticks should be normal in a proper tank Super, no brainded hyperspartial pliz!!!)
---
You can maybe rat with 2-3 Supers at a time but thats a fucking klickfest even with keybinds.
---
Thats exactly the reason people in Delve started Titan ratting because it requires significantly less input and you don't need to watch them 24/7, if you forgott or delay your weapons there is next to no punishment compared to fighters.
---
&gt; If anything, Panfam/WinCo would likely welcome TAPI as an ally in WWBee 2.
---
A lot of TAPI line members would love that, too. There's a pretty vocal group in the alliance (that includes most of leadership) who has the biggest hate boner for PL and cries about how mean they were every other day at least.
---
Glad we can make your work interesting and engaging.
---
&gt;CCP needs to THOROUGHLY evaluate and discuss changes with their playerbase.  
---
Uhmmm.... no?
---
Why not change wormholes cloaks and kitey ships to all be less powerful and “put it in devblogs and patch notes”
---
It’s against your preferential narrative but show you’re unbiased for once as a developer
---
Kinda have to bring it up when this bullshit comes out.
---
&gt;If anything, Panfam/WinCo would likely welcome TAPI as an ally in WWBee 2.

I'm quite curious why there are 2 harpies and 1 retribution in this montage wasn't shooting at you
---
Wh is fun, rite?
---
It wasn't removed from the launcher, it drops out of the news cycle when we release more news after it. The launcher displays the most recent news.
---
Regardless of the news, people should be checking their market orders before they're hitting any buttons to accept any form of trade, and should be checking numbers. 
---
If you're not doing so, then you're just assuming that you've done everything right, which is incredibly dumb and part of the core issue with the current state of the game - people feel too safe.
---
Usually the ones who weren't looking for a fight but a fight found them anyway.
---
The Chinese says the entire article is fake
---
Panfam and TEST were neutral. TEST inserted itself in the conflict between C02 and Panfam, where co2 had severals outs to de-escalate.
---
TEST seeked out the biggest blue donut then and does so now as well. Not everyone wants Serenity mate.
---
Change cloaks.  Change nullification.  Change kitey bullshit.
---
Boom now fleets will actually be forced to fight again. 
---
It’s against reddit’s narrative though, and yours.  But surely somewhere under your bias you realize reddit’s “give muh free kills danger for pve huehue” entitlement screeching that it isn’t healthy to bow down to as a company
---
I’d like to think you’re capable of that much thought... God knows Hilmar isn’t
---
This "salt miner" is trying to point out and get a company to make changes on poor communication. This post has nothing to do with anything in the actual game; only CCP's communication about changes in the game.
---
I don't want EVE to be a game where i'm having to religiously stalk CCP's news site and potentially developer twitter accounts to be aware of changes in the game. If something notably changes, i expect it to be visible in the launcher or clearly in the game itself by notification or the change being very visible without being able to miss.
---
The dumbness of this post makes my brain hurt.
---
TEST+GOONS and assorted allies make up more like 80% of null. Not half.
---
*Ils sont partis la queue entre les jambes*
---
That was great ! thanks to everyone who showed up !
---
Could be ye.
---
Why add complexity?
---
I dont think anything should be given to the attacker because bigger groups might roam around in massive fleets and just glass entire regions. 
---
Same issue as above. Loot pinatas are not a good thing. 
---
Same issue as above. I dont want anything to drop. It will create an imbalance. 
---
Ye and a lot of people dont even know that asset safety was implemented because NPC stations were removed. Nothing dropped from those. You didnt lose anything. At all. This system atleast adds an isk sink whereas the former didnt have any.
---
I dont have any issue with asset safety. And I still havent heard why it should even be changed. I mean, whats the purpose? People have been spewing a lot of hate towards NS, including CCP. Most changes people want are strictly to just hurt NS, not because they make any sense whatsoever.
---
So if anything is supposed to change, there first needs to be a good reason. So give us a good reason.
---
No cap holes and I think this would be a reasonable content driver. Capital holes could be used too effectively for power projection if you had a big enough blue donut to be uncontestable.
---
Sadly the only regions with active players are the populated ones, rest of null is dead - fucking sucks to roam Dronelands or all of the north-east nowadays.
---
The big places are still filled but the rest is nonexistant.
---
Stealth game mechanic changes is not a good thing. Especially so in eve.
---
Wait,  so I now have to make a video to be part of this?
---
I've never tried to record anything while playing and I'm not sure my 2nd gen i7 will be up to the task. 
---
4 prizes also seems pretty limited...
---
Proc's are durable but you don't need them when mining with a rorq. Switch at least two of them to covetors, and keep the last one as a drone bunny.  
---
My rorq with a T1 core post nerf but before the balckout started was getting a boosted covetor with T2 strips to produce about 40-60% of what the 5 excavs  were doing. 
---
The covetor will pay for itself super fast even if it explodes. It's worth what... 10% of one excav drone?
---

all the hyperions are into vindicators in a week because of the money they make :)
---
If lots of people say it, there’s usually a reason for it. 
---
You guys always ping like hell if a structure gets touched but will suicide roll away to avoid fighting anyone who can form even numbers with you. This isn’t exactly breaking news.
---
You don't represent your corp and vice versa. 
---
You can be a good person, yet your corp seems to want to avoid fighting us no matter the timezone, it's always off-timezone.

When's the right time for a pospy fight? I'd love another 10v10 drakes that lasts an hour

When you are reducing your rental income, which drives SRP, by X and ask your membership to foot half or less than that of the loss so that the SRP fund stays high and allows FCs of all calibers to continue to take out fleets with line members feeling confident that their losses will continue to be mitigated; it isn't a terrible idea especially at the price tag and the trade off of opting to reduce rental space to unify the whole.
---
Oooo yeah let’s confuse having a conversation about it with being mad lol

When the production price of a super is under 10b and titan build prices are sub 50. Tell me how the economy *not* broken. Please.

Watched a buddy using retrievers with a rorqual get deleted by bombers man.  Can’t panic in time.

he's not op tho
---
the eve community is similar to other games in that it's just a big  competition to enjoy. the fact that it takes time in PVE to earn every attempt at PVP is what makes pilots generally have mutual respect for any genuine fights
---
hi team i fed my whole fleet last night to a variety of pve'ers and today i'm going to go do it again, hope to see you out there and boost your ticks!
---
It isn't terrible, as long as you can use excavators, which with their current speed is a big risk under blackout. Honestly, they should just balance blackout and make the excavator drones a LOT faster. That encourages paying attention rather than AFK mining.
---
Also all the applied nerfs just hurt the players with 1-3 rorqual pilots. The bigger whales just N+1 because they're already filthy rich, can buy alts from the Bazaar and scale near infinite.

So should changes with no visible mention in the launcher 24h after release be assumed normal now? This thread is specifically about the communication, or lack of it in this case, about a game-impacting change. Whether it was removed from the launcher (my words) or "it dropped out of the news cycle", the end result is the problem i point out in my OP: players aren't made aware of anything changing, have no reason to believe anything is different and have no reason to go out of their way to doublecheck every single thing ingame or start looking up dev blogs every day just in case something did change.
---
Is it really too much to ask for the launcher or game to make it clear a patch has happened, when a patch has happened, so players can be aware?

Heh...  not bad, kid. Not bad at all. Your meme, I mean. It's not bad. A good  first attempt. It's plenty dank... I can tell it's got some thought  behind it... lots of quotable material...
---
But  memeing isn't all sunshine and rainbows, kid. You're skilled... that  much I can tell. But do you have what it takes to be a Memester? To join  those esteemed meme ranks? To call yourself a member of the Ruseman's  Corps? Memeing takes talent, that much is true. But more than that it  takes heart. The world-class Memesters - I mean the big guys, like  Johnny Hammersticks and Billy Kuahana - they're out there day and night,  burning the midnight meme-oil, working tirelessly to craft that next  big meme.
---
And you know what, kid?  99 times out of a hundred, that new meme fails. Someone dismisses it as  bait, or says it's "tryhard," or ignores it as they copy/paste the  latest shitpost copypasta dreamt up by those sorry excuses for cut-rate  memers over at reddit. The Meme Game is rough, kid, and I don't just  mean the one you just lost :).  It's a rough business, and for every artisan meme you craft in your  meme bakery, some cocksucker at 9gag has a picture of a duck or some  shit that a million different Johnny No-Names will attach a milion  different captions to. Chin up, kid. Don't get all mopey on me. You've  got skill. You've got talent. You just need to show your drive.

See you on the boards...

The fanboy thing is pretty funny tbh. People should just record their own deliveries, not rely on Chance getting them into a video. Pretty sure if they send you a recording of something cool you'd promote it.

Don’t go anywhere, I need to refill my salt shaker

: the dream:
---
What you want is a "pls don't break my mod too badly" and will NOT work with many of the possible rolled modules, the amount of god rolls would be insane and ruin the market. We don't need a safety net, we don't need the ability to re-roll modules, keep the system as-is. If you allow safety nets then officer god rolls will be the norm and the isk sink in rolling them will be completely gone. Quit advocating risk-adversity in the only mechanic in the game that has unavoidable risk.
---
Jesus yes please.
---
For people with high skills it's actually 10x Large Injectors, but ya...it's purely for rich elites.
---
Best way to do it is have a cyno alt on-site, Titan alt at KS. Undock, titan bridge to cyno, kill rat. With enough bling you can alpha a frigate pretty easily.

I like the game. People naturally talk about things they like.  Sometimes they end up talking to other people about something they like and make friends.

my point being frt are more fun to fight than xix, less risk averse and have a better attitude in general as far as null blocks go whereas xix, well... lol
---
so you post to discuss rather than to get your ideas implemented?
---
At least they're slowly raising the average. I still remember those first monochrome dark green/brown skins that looked like the ship was dunked into a paint bucket and left to dry. No details, no actual texture, just one texture material placed everywhere, windows, armor plating, hardpoints, all exactly the same.
---
Also, still waiting for CCP to show the Proteus some love with an actual nice skin.
---
they learned the maneuver from reading ww2 french tactics
---
Yes, posts like this are honestly meant as a starting point and hoping others share their opinions and ideas. I don't have to agree with them and they don't have to agree with me, it's just like a sounding board with other people that are passionate about the game and maybe some of the ideas don't seem utter shit and might turn out to get implemented by chance.
---
Nerf all pve and nerf kitey bullshit, cloaks, and nullification too
---
Crying over one side but wanting to keep the other is childish and short sighted
---
Sure, one thing to go neutral, another to immediately go and curb stomp your allies out of their space.
---
Not saying that PF was wrong, just that politically it was a very bad idea and put TEST into goons arms.  Goons have kept their agreements with TEST so far, and know how to make and keep allies and how important that is.  PF made a big mistake, and basically cemented the current allegiances we see.

We don't get hit by 70 percent taxes.  Between federal and state income taxes, I get hit by about 30 % taxes.

Yeah, *maybe* we could have lived in Vale with panfam up our ass, as long as we never undocked anything with a jump drive.

More like panfam just can't stand losing.  "Serenity" was never a problem when panfam and goons split the map.  https://i.imgur.com/zVkd9sZ.png
---
I would support this idea. :)
---
Are you [sure](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cl31st/breaking_news_panfam_plans_leaked/evsqdjj/)?
---
I will disagree that loot pinatas are a bad thing, it gives an incentive to actually attack structures. Why would you attack structures right now? To create content that will be ignored by the defenders because they will just asset safety out any assets? 
---
And you make it sound like glassing an entire region is easy, but it's really not. If you want to attack every structure in a region, you need to deploy your fleet for very long hours on a period of weeks. You can't really separate your fleet otherwise you're going to get jumped by fleets that will win local conflicts and slowly destroy your fleet.  You can be harassed. You need to maintain control of pipes to prevent assets coming in and out. You need to be on top of JFs moving assets out and people safe logging off in Freighters. This is basically wormhole hole control for an entire region and it's already very hard to maintain hole control on a single wormhole system, it's even harder for an entire region. Something like PanFam simply moving out wouldn't happen as easily because they couldn't just asset safety everything to 1 lowsec station and move out from there. The defenders will actually defend because otherwise they will lose their shit.
---
There needs to be an incentive for attackers besides "maybe we will get a fight, but the other guys will probably blueball". It gives an incentive to the defenders because they need to defend the structure to not lose assets. The goal is to create more reasons to fight than "otherwise, our line members will get bored krabbing 24/7".
---
They replaced the "loot will never drop" mechanic from outposts, but also removed the loot drop mechanic from POS structures. You didn't ruin someone by killing POSes, but you actually got stuff from it, giving an additional incentive to attack.
---
I find Wormholes extremely taxing as a new player.
---
As a noob you usually want to train into something cool that can boost you in PvP (or PvE) - you want skills and one main ship.
---
You need the core 14 engineering skills tho to fly most modules.
---
In WH without a proper ship and without proper skills you can't neither PvP or PvE very well, also WH combatsites are cancer to solo and pay next to nothing in c1-c3. If you manage to solo c4 combatsites you're good but the problem is your sites in your system despawn if cleared and respawn in any c4 in your constellation/region. So if other people in other c4s don't fly sites chances are low you get new sites in your home' so you usually roll your static and rat in your chain not in your home once all sites in your home are depleted.
---
If you're a new player and want to pvp WHs suck in both ways, you need special ships that are cloaced or dscan immune and also need ships that are specialized like scanners/bombers/interdictor/interceptor/command destroyer/t3ds/t3cs...
---
They're hard to train into as a noob. Your best choice would be a T3D(estroyer) like Hecate or Confessor, Confessor are also for PvE. But even T3Ds need three weeks to sit in them and even longer to fly properly with engineering skills and weapons / module skills.
---
WHs dont pay much to refund losses if you're in c1-3, you need some time solo ratting in c4 to make money.
---
In big null alliances you can SALVAGE with 1mil skillpoints behind several Supercarriers or Titans in Delve / Esoteria. You make about 70-100mil ISK per hour if only a SINGLE Supercarrier you can leech of is in System, just ask around there are plenty ratting in Legacy or the Imperium etc.! You need no skillpoints to make money and within one or two days you can Skill Inject into a T3D and go PvP on active Coalition Fleets. Within some weeks you can Skill Inject into all those essential 14 different engineering skills (look up magic 14 EvE) and safe some money, maybe also train into PvE ships then go into wormholes.
---
WHs are best if you have necessary skills to fucking fly ships that can do shit, but WHs pay nothing to a noob in c1-c4 who needs to fly in a group. c4s pay good but only solo without sharing earnings.
---
Go salvage in null, make money leeching of Titans and Supers, train into cool shit then go PvP in WH.
---
You need an upgraded account / character.
---
Loosing is no fun.

Why should a ship that doesn't exist get a skin? ( ._.)
---
I spent a couple of years in a minor alliance in N3.  The PL and NC. (to a lesser extent) FC's and members always treated us like trash.  We showed up in the correct ships, followed what we were told to do, and didn't complain but always got called out when someone wouldn't align.  When a PL guy didn't align, it was still our fault.  In hindsight, it was basically an abusive relationship.
---
3-5 days stuck with the same "unrollable" hole?!?!  No thanks...that doesn't sound like a content generator at all. Imagine you get a hole to a stagnent system with little activity....for 3-5 days....and you can't roll it for new content.
---
why do you choose to use reddit to try and have meaningful discussion?
---
just in the first 7 or so brs you have 3 being non wh fights, a very blobbed citadel defense(?), a rolling carrier gank attempt(?) and what appears to be a desperate attempt at trying to save one of your lokis that got caught, unless we assume loki+2 scimis+griffin+kitsune+2 frigs is a doctrine. That's where i stopped cause honestly why even bother
---
It's an active community and generally speaking, a lot less overreaction to anything in general than the actual EVE forums. Also, I can do it easier on my phone with the app than the EVE forums.
---
"extra materials" are still MATERIALS.
---
None of those other things you just listed are materials.
---
If you make that much you’re using excavators and I want to see your opinion after losing 30 hours of mining in profits to a single frigate with a bomb or loki that uncloaked and hit f1.
---
I can tell you as someone who mines you’re a downright fool or a liar because the “sell price” or estimated value is never what you’ll make, so cut that down.
---
Heavy water is another cost, deduct that too.
---
Lose 2.5bil in drones from someone who spends 10 seconds of effort and subtract that too since you want to rile up the reddit echo chamber with this bullshit.
---
And the worst part? CCP falcon admitted his JOB is to read reddit’s echo chamber for feedback on the game so untruthful shit like this will actually have an impact.
---
I agree.  Nerf rorqs carriers rats fuck it nerf all pve period.  But also take away kitey fits, nullification, and cloaks.  You want to fuck over the sandbox for macro gamers fuck it over for the micro bears as well
---
No idea ... unless you find it on reddit, the low class wh groups are usually very quiet about stuff happening :O
---
Tou mean like Serenity Coalition consistent of panfam goons and legacy? :)
---
Multiboxing is a significant part of the game. Getting rid of it would hurt the bottom line hard and really hurt every metric we can judge the health of the game by.
---
So suitonia's stats are now better than "the most vibrant summer in the past 5 years" stats?  Numbers can tell any story you want.  Bottom line is we, all of us, don't have all the numbers just what's available on various 3rd party tools that CCP provides us.  Every conclusion based on partial numbers is not the truth - and let's not kid ourselves; numbers can say whatever we want them to say and follow any narrative.  Make up your own mind, not based on anyone's swiss cheese statistics.

Align a raitaru with an asteroid belt in hisec, as close as possible while still being off grid (.01 AU?).
---
When frig rat is spotted in belt, undock Rifter and warp to belt, kill rat. You must be able to kill the rat in the first shot, otherwise try again with proper ammo. Ascendencies can be used to improve warp drive speed but at that point your potential SP to ISK ratio from winning the contest doesn't beat what you can get with injectors. But since it's eve you should probably assume someone out there is gonna min-max this strat to the absolute limit and take multiple runs to account for lag or whatever.

Why does spread formation even exist, it is useless?
---
That's the thing. PVE in EVE is easy and repetitive, let it be mining or ratting. There are no hard PVE contents except Incursions and abyssals, and only the latter is truly hard. 
---
And that's probably intentional, to make it easier to balance the game's economics.  But that's also where the botting problem stems from: simple and repetitive tasks are something that bots do the best. I am not saying that bots are not present in other MMOs; but they are less common, due to the general difficulty of PVE, and sometimes only do a few selected dungeons.
---
I would really hope EVE's PVE transition away from "killing/mining as much shit as you can" to maybe "killing/mining the hardest you can". Maybe something that's more like abyssals minus the instance, something that you have to pay attention to or you explode, with good rewards. Or maybe mini-incursions that encourages players to form fleets and play together. PVP might be the backbone of this game, but it's time to admit the lameness of PVE is causing problems.
---
Oh, I do know this whole "TAPI got forced to team up with goons" riddle. Fact is, it doesn't really matter now. What matters is a healthy balance of power to keep the game interesting. And to restore that you basically need another WWBee.
---
Merc, is that you?
---
Barve is decent dudes, unlike mittens little boy toy's
---
What are you talking about? It takes like 5 minutes to set a planet up for T1 and you only have to collect the resources every few days and most corps have some sort of buyback so you don't even have to ship anything.
---
Yeah it can take sometime if you're trying to do T3/T4 production but for most people it only takes a few minutes every day or two.
---
Allow me to be nitpicky for a moment. It's more like gg in that case. Glhf in Starcraft is usually said at the start of the game, before the fight.
---
Constant change is only good if the change is at least known of being there. This was a pure numbers change, and currently you can log in and see nothing different, have no hint anything changed. But you can then easily be burnt by the change's effects.
---
IMO it's not too much to ask for a game's launcher or the game itself to give a signal a patch happened, when a patch happened. This patch had all hint and mention removed 24 hours after it happened, which IMO is just terrible communication about said patch.
---
I feel like a lot of this could simply be handled by creating more destruction in eve. Making more opportunities for people to lose their assets. I think that will be a greater sink that any kind of 100k isk tax used in a hangar.
---
I think y'all are doing great, my corp is rolling with the punches.
---
Breaking News! Long time strategic allies to form strategic alliance in opposition to opposing strategic allies!

World of EVE ships nice, also there should be a plex transaction everytime you want to activate a module on another persons ship each time.

&gt;dropping four citadels in a hole for content
---
&gt;wtf why is wspace empty
---
You keep cherrypicking what you want to hear.  No, what I'm advocating is the ability to mitigate the good and bad by reducing rng, which is never fun.
---
You would still have bad and even terrible rolls, the difference I am asking for is to at least be able to salvage a baseline from a shitty situation.  If I get a mega shitty roll, I still have to choose where to put all of that.  Let me make those choices.  
---
On the flip side, when you have your "god tier" rolls, having healthy attribute chaining would actually prevent what you are referring to, and reduce the overall effect of a super positive roll.
---
So, specifically if I was looking at a prop mod, and had a god tier roll, I could boost the speed, but for each positive swing up, I increase the signature penalty/agility and power consumption by the same percentage.  So I boost the power draw, and my power grid and cpu go up to compensate.  
---
Give me more choice than clicking a button and gambling.  
---
You speak of unavoidable risk and that's bullshit, as it is I don't even bother with the system, and thus completely avoid it.  It's the single most avoidable mechanic of the game.
---
Ty for the sources m8
---
For some reason I really resented buying 1.5bn of fuel for my Titan, so I mined it all myself not with Rorqs, with Endurances :p.
---
Or do the tutorial missions in a frigate with t2 guns
---
It doesn't matter that I made my bed, whst matters is that I have to lie in it.
---
The blue donut is big enough without having to make it up. I frankly do not care about TTT drama, those guys can all take a flying leap.
---
These are purely to address one of the statements (and it has been made a few times) by Hilmar and co. about too much isk in circulation.
---
Okay, so you actually think a carrier should be faster than an interceptor. This is impossible to justify from a balance standpoint.
---
&gt;That means that even if they can jump long distances its a huge risk since they cant just jump out again.
---
Yeah, because other cynos. So if you nerf... no. Lets not fix anything.
---
&gt;I dont think there is any issue with caps, cyno, supers, umbrellas and so on. At all. 
---
This is the reason people cant take fights. How is that not a problem?
---
&gt;At all. I do however think its an issue that small gang needs content that suits them better than trying to fight under an umbrella.
---
But you cant because everyone has caps and they can instantly travel.
---
&gt;But in NS, if you have a spool up timer for cynos it will mean those cyno ships will get killed everytime you are trying to fight a big timer. 
---
Yes, and that shouldnt be a problem unless someone basically wanted to use their cap as an instantly traveling subcap. Where is the reason why the largest ships should be able to be almost anywhere instantly?
---
&gt;Thats a heavy advantage for the defender.
---
So much talk about this, but that ignores the other use.
---
&gt;You cant balance for small gang because it will wreck big gang. 
---
The only time these 5 minutes matter is when you want to offensively drop or bailout stuff that shouldnt be alone.
---
&gt;But I also know you cant balance them out.
---
Of course you can. There is nothing that stops it other than people wanting their crabbing intact.
---
&gt;Things that work for 5 people will seldom work for 500 people. And I dont think its fair that 5 people should get preferential treatment over 500.
---
Right now the balance is non-existent or it is balanced for those 500 people and it breaks the game and causes stalemates.
---
What's funny is he's complaining about a defender's greater ability to pull in allies in a fight where he had a big advantage in numbers. his alliance *by itself* without the allies he brought in slightly outnumbered the defenders *with* their allies. And the specific logi issue which I'm *sure* was massively frustrating while his fleet was getting dunked on was just as much a problem for them as it was for him. They didn't game the system in any of the ways he's worrying about in this clip if only because they're a low-sec group and didn't understand the high-sec mechanics any better than he did. 
---
Of course high-sec is going to have more convoluted rules about who can shoot who etc. that's the whole *point* of high-sec. Eve has a *lot* of complicated mechanics many of them specific to the different security levels. You *often* learn about those different mechanics by getting burned by them the first time you try something new. Null sec sov mechanics wouldn't be any more intuitive to high-sec war-deccers if they decided to move out and become a null-sec group and it would take a couple of fights where they get burned before they adjust.
---
The next war he starts in high-sec he'll understand mechanics better and he'll plan accordingly and it'll be fine.
---
Also, with Fedup alone they outnumbered the defenders in the particular War he's referencing.
---
So another ship that needs nerfing. Why do we constantly have to wait for the obvious?
---
We call them "Paid Actors" in Krypted
---
Oh yikes.
---
HS is the most dangerous area of space.  So many neutrals and you never know which one's plan to gank you nor where.
---
I generally feel like a lot of the criticism CCP receives from its community is unwarranted, and some of it is just ridiculous, incomprehensible tin-foil hat fuckery.
---
That said...
---
While I don't think this is **actually** the case, shifting the release schedule from "glacial" to, "Fuck it, just ship it nao," overnight and then saying, "What?  You guys complained we didn't do anything quickly enough, soooo..." makes it seem almost like it's lashing out, punitively, at the community in response to those criticisms.  It *looks* like a, "They don't think we do anything quickly enough?  We'll show them what happens when we do things quickly," sort of "stigginit" response.
---
I also don't think flitting, rapid-fire, from feature change to unrelated feature change is what any of those complaints had in mind.  Rather, I suspect most people wanted to see faster, and more **consistent**, iteration on features, instead of, "Here's an imperfect thing that might be better with some adjustments, but we're just going to abandon it for the next 6 years before totally redoing it in a completely different, imperfect way that we'll similarly abandon for another 6 years."
---
Okay so I didn't know they still kept the dude who was literally tethered to the enemy citadels.
---
Uh... Yikes. Lol
---
I sort of don’t mind it how it is now. I’m in a small alliance and don’t see much things to be different than any other point in the game. Big bloks grr. Blob blob blob. Krabs gona krab. Best part is there isn’t any local and that makes it harder on bots and messes with the economy. The last thing I need to see is citadels proliferation to get abolished and that probably isn’t going to happen. So I guess we are as good as it’s gona get. Let the big blocks keep shooting each other. Goons/tapi/panfam. They’re basically all different skins of the same thing
---
every player ever**
---
You misspelled blobbong.
---
Mate have you seen Nullsec Incursions?
---
30 Supercarrier + FAXes and a supporting Battleship Subcapital group...
---
Fucking brainded.
---
Incursions are a Joke, you have less to no risk because Incursion Systems are Jammed and nobody fucking gates a Dreadbomb into a 60man fleet composed of Supercapitals and Bhaalgorns (web support bonus to make fighters apply, neut only for lulz because empty highslots also bhaals are cheap asfuck) ffs. Nobody fucking fights over Nullsec Incursions, if you as a hostile enters there they get headshotted by 120+ NetworkSA Nyx HeavyFighters on steroids because of their three tracking computer boni.
---
Sure those Nyxes / Aeons only have like 4k dps in fulltank fit but they fucking track your Ass pretty well!

The pod mechanic was a good isk sink, only the poor people with high sp started complaining they didn't want to fly frigs anymore because of the costs.

Since the change from the SSO authorized key to the new ESI Z-kill has only recorded about 1 in 3 of my Omega kills/losses.

In addition I have a 14 month old alpha relic hunter, never been registered on Z-Kill, has 0 losses/kills showing out of the 25+ it has clocked up (being an explorer these are mostly losses) .

Ofc you should'nt have lived in Vale after inserting yourself into the  conflict and loosing it. Not said you shouldnt have moved.
---
"我们爱•真篇文章都是假的” this is what it was written at the end, feel free to translate
---
What's broken about it?  There are more people in nullsec, so there's more mining happening and people have to put their ore into something.  It's about demand and supply, not some abstract isk/hr calculation.
---
well there's also him being banned on a regular basis due to RMT
---
Yeah, you see how bad it is when people can just cyno left and right. Traveling is too easy!
---
That guy's comment doesn't even make sense.
---
This "Test victim story" is kinda debatable, if only for the fact that the Money Badger Coalition was designed from the get-go to split up after WWBee. In the end, nobody wants a blue donut. After goons got stomped everybody would go after eachother again.
---
For now, it doesn't matter though. What matters is an interesting game, which simply seizes to exist when alliance becomes more powerful than the rest combined. It's up to Test what they want to do about it.
---
C5&amp;6 space is full of krabs and cap blobbers. So you must be either a krab, a cap blobber or a true hero who lives in c2 c5/null. What an absolute legend lmao.
---
And yet the rich still get richer (although at a very slightly diminished rate)
---
The irony here is this entire situation was brought about by Panfam going and invading Test while we were following up on Goons to try and limit their ability to rebuild. So instead of a weakened or dead CFC, you end up with an absurdly strong CFC that was allowed to rebuild unopposed because Panfam decided it was simply too hard to deploy to Delve, so let’s invade TEST instead. It’s the ultimate form of karma.
---
When CEO said "we had to many plex sales"... prices went up  
---
When CEO said "plex is to high"... prices went down  
---
It's almost like people hording it as a market strategy pay attention to these things.  
---
Also multiple 15% sales, and it's already marching back towards 4m.
---
unsubbed 33 accounts!! see i can also put some random numbers.
---
I understand logic would hurt someone who only thinks small gang pvp will somehow save a fucking sandbox pvp mmo.
---
You fucking walnut
---
Balance is really hard. No sarcasm intended.
---
We werent allied, we were neutral after WWB, that was the plan everyone had signed up to. It wasnt a secret either. You inserted yourself into the conflict between C02 and Panfam. The conflict wasnt initiated directly between Panfam and TEST.
---
&gt;What matters is an interesting game, which simply seizes to exist when panfam is losing.
---
It's an Ihub upgrade so it's a sov thing, not a wormhole thing.
---
What would we actually do if CCP actually played the game?  At least they could have you-tubed how to properly do it before putting this out...  tbh it's a bit embarrassing.
---
No they dont. Some do. Some will poke for a fight. Only a few will go full eviction mode on a regular basis. Generally, if you give good fights and dont cap blob everything in sight, you get left alone.
---
Evictions aren't fun or easy unless the corp is dead or it's a farm hole.
---
I am not in TEST.  At no point did I say that what you did was wrong, I said it was politically stupid.
---
doesnt really matter how you keep not ignoring it ..
---
Lol "I mean stop batphoning?"
---
great name btw
---
They gave us the [croque madame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVRl1aP28BI)
---
I'm kinda wondering now if we have a proper WH campus set up.
---
It's not like us \~evil\~ people will probably be any worse than the big C5 groups, just more open when we evict small people.
---
Little bit of an explanation.
---
Every day during the event I run enough anoms in highsec until I get an escalation, then call it a day.
---
Recently noticed a swarm of [Facedesk keyboard] [Random generated surname] gila pilots in the anoms who seem to be following a very similar, as if, scripted behavior
---
They warp to an anom, if there is another player in it, they warp off. They seem to sit at 0 for a good while before doing anything.
---
Not sure if bots, but certainly raised my suspicion of them being bots due to VERY similar behavior, 4 days old and all of them in Gilas.
---
so why you keep replying then? miss me? lol
---
Looks as if he rolled his face over the keyboard while creating a name
---
Happy Friday guys. 
---
Hope you all have a good weekend. 
---
Mines going to be off to a good start. My friend is coming to my house to make chilli as their family don't like it. Then they've got me in to stranger things, I've just started s2.
---
You sound like a perfect fit for Waffles EUTZ
---
You’re doing better in the past month than you have in as long as my short term human memory can remember. Blackout was awesome. I’m interest to see how this effects the market after watching plex prices start to go down due to the blackout. :popcorn:  pvp has been so much more fun blacked out.
---
who the hell would have a croque madame for breakfast
---
French btw
---
Feel free to stick around as a glorified goons pet in a boring blue donut game then, nobody is forcing you.
---
Oh. Damn. Well I laughed anyway!
---
Oh look, just like I predicted. Blackout wouldn't stop botting, they just moved.
---
I like the idea but there has to be a counterplay option.  Is there a module that has to be added to places that can block the WH or maybe something that can cut it's lifetime and close it?  Because I'm all for player created wormholes and a stream of pvp flowing through that wormhole, but I'd also want a chance to strand the attackers who then get massacred.
---
People feel too safe. &lt;3 you are awesome. I can’t upvote this enough.
---
Most profitability in PI, AFAIK, comes from setting up PI for a day or so at a time, which means daily resetting of extractors, probably across multiple characters. Especially if scaled up and involving the relogging, it's a decent time investment.
---
A while back i set up T2 on a few planets myself, to see how PI had changed (hadn't touched it in many many years). The total time setting up (P2) for four planets was about 40 minutes, picking a good location, setting all the links and routes. I haven't kept up with doing it every day but after a few weeks of semi-active refreshing the total value of the goods on there is ~35m.
---
It's not terrible, but it does take time investment, especially if scaled up. No issue with liking it or making isk out of it, but the words "it's free ISK" is just a very wrong mentality. Even if not that much time is invested, you spend time for it like any other activity.
---
&gt;While I'd be stoked for variable system security, randomly changing HS into LS would be a bit far.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Picking up a suspect flag for warping to an incursion site I could get behind.
---
No we can be honest here, this is straight up the dumbest shit I have ever seen
---
can someone copy paste the blog? at work, thanks xoxo
---
I mean pl/nc started reinforcing our shit..
---
If you find yourself in a fair fight, you made a mistake.
---
The only reason to fight is to win.  The best way to win is to have an advantage over your opponent.  If you find you don't have an advantage, then you erred in picking the time, place and equipment to fight with.
---
Because, my dear retard, first you need to have 100(s) of billions of liquid isk to begin with; you need to have multiple accounts with various skills; you need to have a contact that supplies you with ore (and/or ability to move it yourself - which means even more accounts); and so on and forth. How many people do you know who have 15 accounts, can do all that, and are willing to do all that? 100? This isnt something youll be doing with 6 months old character.
---
This. And Nullsec kills are higher. In total numbers show less kills because Highsec wardecs. But Null has bigger numbers and Low sec kills had move to null too.

---
I actually quite like walnuts. 
---
Thanks.
---
I don't even hate the fact they're doing very rapid changes now, but it almost seems like they're made to be hidden changes. A game not making any mention of a patch, even though very established mechanics changed, is IMO bad.
---
All i'd really "need" to be okay with everything is for the launcher to have a clear link there was a patch and to link to the devblog that announced it. Right now the launcher just shows no hint anything did change. Even finding the devblog, you can't be certain it actually touched tranquility yet. That's just the poor communication i want to highlight and hopefully have changed.
---
most of the time the fleets I have been in say it to those who fight out numbered and choose to still try to defend their space.
---
A rouq isn't the problem in the same way a VNI also wasn't the problem.  Its the amount you can effectively run in the same system.
---
Nah I collect. Someone offered some iskies for the corpse. Fuck them, the more the offer the more I value it.
---
Genuine question, are Hosa a thing still? Like do c4 Corps try to insta roll from them? Cos that's normal the sign of a pvp Corp.
---
Most of us are good chaps.
---
But if you fight peoples like the Darwin guys....it can be very painfull to read their shittalking pre and post fight.
---
Special thanks to the Dutch East Querious guys who bombed themselves last night. I appreciate you entertaining my fleet, we were starting to get bored. &lt;3
---
You have a point but Jesus Christ there are better ways to make it.
---
Its called assymetrical warfare. Who seriously expects a 10 man gang to fight 50+ straight up in kitey ships? We catch fat kids all the time that miss fleet warps and kill them before their friends can return. Their incompetence is punished. Just as it should be. Stop trying to make it easier for the mega blobs.
---
Thats exactly the issue, it gives incentive. When a group has 1000 titans to field, thats not a good thing. They attack to remove structures. Thats a good enough reason. Its strategic, not because of isk.
---
I get the idea, but its not going to play out like that. Thats an issue in perhaps low or high sec, not an NS issue. People dont just ref citas because they like it, its because it already serves a purpose here. Besides, dont enginering citas already drop stuff? I dont see a rush to kill them so there is no basis for saying it would create fights when its clearly not doing it atm.
---
Which just happened in the north? Without any great concern? In theory what you say is true, in reality its gonna play out like it did. 
---
Panfam moved their stuff dude, I dont think many asset safetied it and it was even a an article about the logistical nightmare a move is. But not an impossible one. 
---
Your assumption is that people cant move their stuff. A cita has multiple timers. Its more than enough time to move stuff. There is no reason to defend a structure outside of a strategic sense and no asset safety wont change that.
---
Ye but forts arent a replacement for POSs, they are replacements for stations. Which means that loot didnt drop. And besides, as I stated above I am fairly certain enginering structures already drop stuff so why arent everyone rushing to kill them?
---
In NS, you dont start a war (big groups) because you want some loot. It will do jack shit to create tension or anything suggested. Which means the negative effects of changing asset safety is going to far outweigh any potential positive effects. Thats a bad change.
---
However, you do start wars because of strategic purposes. Any change with purpose of creating more wars needs to serve a strategic reason. Spreading people out might do it, idk. But not even that will work because the issue is that we dont have enough players. NS is empty and there is no real reason to fight because you can always move. If there werent enough space, then ye wars would be more frequent. But it would cause other issues as one side would sooner or later win creating the serenity effect.
---
So I dont know what is needed, but I do know removal of asset safety wont fulfill those needs leaving us with tons of sideeffects that will hurt the smaller guys far more than the big guys thereby creating more stagnation.
---
I want my nyx to warp faster! Each second spent in warp could be shooting red crosses.
---
1. You werent invaded
---
2. You inserted yourselfs into a conflict between c02 and panfam. You chose to become party to the conflict.
---
3. You deployed in Delve, got paid for it. You had no commitments form other groups to join the party, not sure why you act surprised.
---
You play too much world of warships.
---
And you've instantly lost all credibility.
---
I once sold 50 corpse for 10mil a pop.
---
Good times
---
I don't think the blackout was created to stop botting. It just had the unintended(?), and positive, consequence of making bots easier to kill and cutting the amount of isk generated by them. Moving forward if they decided to move into hisec if they want to make the same amount of cash they are goin g to have to bot even harder and will be easier to spot by CCP.
---
Somebody apperently still thinks you can win Eve by playing it.
---
Keep in mind that in the injector era, if you're happy with the skills an account has, it's essentially free to keep it omega.  You just put in a long skill on your remap and extract it at the end of the month.  It's usually smarter to do this than to keep it PLEXed and training some skill to V that only boosts your yield by 2% or whatever.
---
4 days old fly gila...

Blackout in highsec now!

250mm rails don't fit: so put on smaller rails that can track better.

Mod slots: what's holding you back? Pwg, cpu, total slots? Should be possible. 
---
Normal Harb: ok? That has no bearing on the conversation at hand.
---
10 years: same, I'm also a navy seal with 300 confirmed kills.
---
Good luck. Ships are a LOT less persistent in eve, expect a lot more losses and (assuming you're being smart about making money) much easier replacements. Some people lose half a dozen or more ships daily, doing fun stuff. Never get too attached to a ship. That's not what it's for.
---
Bonus points for not suggesting that all wormholes lead from lowsec to stain
---
You may be right.  I saw a 2-day old gila pilot in an NPC corp earlier this week.     
---
Passed in high sec, with probably the same birthday.  
---
Don't recall their first name being so random though.
---
I haven't played WoWs is 5 or 6 years and was never fond of the mechanics. Cruisers are flame throwers and battleships catch in fire every single hit.

Well i knew about changes about 4 days in advance...

Which faction warfare pipe is more active during US TZ(23:00-05:00)?  Been out of the FW scene for a while and am curious as to what to expect when going into each.

I know you're not lying because the sheer snobbishness. 
---
I'll eat whatever I want in the morning and with a big mug of instant coffeeeeeeee. FU frenchi
---
So you're saying it's hard to build 100 caps because you need like 100 billion isk to do so. Hate to break it to you but that's not a lot of isk nowadays.
---
In terms of accounts, having double digit alts isn't rare in the age of SP farming and afk mining rorquals.
---
;'( im not good at making friends so anyone who is better at it than me must be the bad guys.
---
Bots? In Eve Online, the hit online gaming experience of 2004? Why, I'd never.

Good luck friend, and welcome to Eve. :) If you ever want to fly with some awesome people in no security space (null), definitely reach out!

Take the time to get to know the game and do the Sisters of Eve Arc. o7
---
Ignore this fool, keep doing what your doing.
---
Swing the NERF bat at supers and citadels next pls.
---
Strange numbers. A normal Carrier can Blitz LV5 missions for 400mil / hour. (Múltiple Carriers spread on missions systems to not gate them. You can do it even.with.some Battleships.)
---
&gt;this is a longer term adjustment and would initially influence seller behaviour.
---
No, it would influence nobody's behavior.
---
1% isn't going to get anyone to change what they're doing.  We know this because 1% isn't enough to get people to seed those "niche" markets.  They're pricing way, way over 1%.
---
I don't get how a thread about CCP not communicating a game change clearly outside of the game (but about the game) comes back to "people feel too safe" as if this impacts the ingame mechanics.

I've been offered 100 mil for 1k corpses. Fuck that guy, I value my collection.

Eve is, or at least can be, a lot more social, too. Try to make some good space friends. They'll help you over the big learning curve. The big null empires aren't the only options.
---
Good luck. I hope you stick around. I remember starting out and some things were a little overwhelming. Try and make some space friends who can help you learn.

Is it an overkill to maintain a leaderboard website for 10 guys?
---
Welcome newbro!  Eve is definitely different than Elite Dangerous however I find them both fun. Eve is the kind of game you will be learning new things in for a looooooong time. 
---
Don’t let that stop you from playing though, I’ve played on and off since 06 and I still learn things all the time. 
---
There are a lot of activities to do in game, however it’s not theme park, you have to go out and find the content or join a Corp that does.  That’s actually my biggest piece of advice, joint a Corp that is new player friendly and ask lots of questions.  Karmafleet, Eve Uni, Pandemic Horde are just a few that specifically cater to new players and will get you into some action rather quick. 
---
Good luck and again, welcome o7
---
CCP I demand fishnet shirts and dancing in stations. Hopefully some blackout too 😏
---
Black coffe I hope?
---
If you have that bulk of a single good, honestly you stand to gain quite a bit by finding a direct buyer. trading via item exchange would save you a lot of ISK, especially with the new taxes.
---
Half your recommendations were WOWs mechanics.
---
Crews
---
Ship slots?
---
you inserted yourselves into a conflict and lost...I too would move out afterwards but yea, no one had the stamina to entosis another region after Tribute. But it was a good choice to move. However, you need to understand the reasons leading up to that.
---
If i may give you another piece of advice I wish I had looked at earlier myself: make yourself a jump clone with implants that increase your stats so your skilling takes less time. Just be careful to always change to a clean clone before you risk your reasonably expensive implants!
---
Oof
---
I,d like to thank you all for making Eve, and its community, to what it is
---
why would they shoot their own keepstar
---
Yay! I’mma give it a try.
---
That's way too low for such a huge collection
---
This, and remove or greatly restrict player stations.
---
&gt;there are better ways to make it.  
---
Understatement of the year
---
A one time cost to use a ship, call it whatever you want. That does not constitute a crew slot. It represents just using the ship. As far as slots? They are already mentioning limiting m3. Perhaps you played warships too much and are correlating it?
---
How many boxes do you plan on running?
---
1-5?
---
CCP  should either nerf the kiki or buff the other sub-cruisers because right now it outshines every single one by a huge amount. Even many cruisers
---
no one wanted to follow goons, what is the fun in beating a dead whale. Hellcamping is boring as hell.
---
Fair enough. My point is then we'd have Panfam and TEST big blue donut covering 80-90% of eve, we'd still be here on the verge of Serenity.
---
You take that back... Q_Q
---
Well, you know what 'git gud' is, in Eve you just have to learn to HTFU as well, that said, welcome to Eve!

WH Bushido (as referred below) is somewhat there. The old groups are mostly good about it. With how empty WHs are I'm always surprised at eviction stories that aren't about some serious revenge/shit-talking readjustments.
---
We're super happy to announce that as part of the Season of Skills a three stage speed run contest is kicking off that will see pilots across the cluster compete to win massive amounts of skill points per stage.
---
Given that the Skilling Spree challenges are super easy to complete, the idea is to see how fast those navigation, ship fitting and target locking skills are, by measuring who can complete different challenges in the fastest possible time.
---
&gt;Stage One of this contest begins as of downtime today, and every pilot in New Eden is eligible to take part. You can find more details on stage one below, and once stage one has come to an end, we'll release details of the following stage.
---
There's a few rules of course, so make sure you read over them along with the instructions on how to submit your entry to make sure that it's counted.
---
As always, if you'd like to discuss this contest, you can do so in the feedback thread over on the official EVE Online forums.
---
STAGE ONE CHALLENGE:
---
Stage One of the Skilling Spree Speed Run is active from 11:00 UTC on 2019/08/02 through to 11:00 UTC on 2019/08/09, for the duration of the first full week of August.
---
Task:
---
Undock, find and kill one NPC in the fastest time possible while flying any Tech I, non-faction frigate class hull.
---
BASE RULES FOR ALL THREE STAGES:
---
All stages of the contest are centered around the most common of the three "Skilling Spree" challenges: kill one NPC for a 10,000 skill point reward.
---
Timing of the speed run begins when the black sesson change screen from undocking ends, revealing the pilot's ship.
---
Timing ends when the locked NPC is destroyed.
---
Point of destruction is considered to be the point when the pilot's ship loses lock due to target destruction.
---
The NPC killed can not be on grid with the station or Upwell structure from which the pilot undocks.
---
Measurement of timing will be made independently by CCP, and times will be recorded to the nearest hundredth (.01) of a second.
---
Timing decisions by CCP are final.
---
Videos must be fully legible, at a minimum resolution of 720p.
---
Pilots can enter each stage of the contest as many times as they like.
---
Pilots are eligible to enter all three stages of the contest, regardless of whether or not they've won a previous stage.
---
Pilots can only win one prize per stage. For example, if a pilot sets the three fastest times in a stage, he is eligible only for first place. Second place is awarded to the fourth fastest time.
---
Only Tech I non-faction hulls can be used, however there are no restrictions on ship fitting.
---
As always, standard contest rules apply.
---
PRIZES:
---
Stage one of the Skilling Spree Speed Run Contest will have the following prizes.
---
1st Place - 1,500,000 Skill Points
---
2nd Place - 1,000,000 Skill Points
---
3rd Place - 500,000 Skill Points
---
Honorable Mention - 250,000 Skill Points
---
Clarifications:
---
Prizes will be paid out to the character that is used to set the winning time.
---
Prizes will be paid in the form of skill points added directly to the unallocated skill points pool.
---
The honorable mention prize will be awarded at CCP's discretion to the funniest, dumbest or most elaborate video submitted for the stage.
---
The Skilling Spree event concludes on August 21st. Winners for all three stages of the Skilling Spree Speed Run Contest will be announced the following Monday, on August 26th.
---
HOW TO ENTER:
---
These are the instructions on how to enter, please make sure that you read them and follow them carefully as failure to do so will void your entry to the contest.
---
Entries to the Skilling Spree Speed Run contest must be in the form of a video that shows the full task for timing purposes.
---
Videos should begin in dock within a station or Upwell structure.
---
Pilots can submit as many entries as they like for each stage, but only the fastest will count.
---
Submitting Entries:
---
Entries can be submitted in the following two ways.
---
Via twitter:
---
Videos can be shared via twitter using the two hashtags #skillingspree and #seasonofskills in order to be visible to the contest judges.
---
Videos may be either a direct upload to twitter or a link to a twitch clip that shows the whole process.
---
The tweet in which the video is shared must also contain the full name of the character that the speed run was made with for verification purposes.
---
Via Email:
---
Videos can be sent to socialmedia@ccpgames.com
---
Videos can be sent as a download link, a link to a twitch clip that shows the whole process, or as an attachment.
---
The email that contains the submission must also contain the full name of the character that the speed run was made with for verification purposes.
---

---
Your problem is thinking you were allies, there were never two sides in wwb. There was just a bunch of alliances that wanted to shoot goons, and agreed to not shoot eachother untill goons moved
---
Done, see above.
---
Kills are rolling in for everyone who is willing to undock. Thanks for writing this up, and putting the correct info out there!
---
Go ahead and take this booster friend 😏
---
I'd like this but at the same time, hisec missioners and miners aren't the guys that need to get hit with the isk sinks as much.
---
Losing? They lost already mate. What are you on about?
---
I am glad that culture didnt get passed on to Horde.
---
NPCs can hit you out to forever. Player owned Ravens can hit out to 300k. It's game mechanics. Cruise missiles have a long range. You need a better tank.
---
Baguette never fights unless they have an easy gank. Garbage group, garbage players
---
&gt;Ignore this fool
---
Can you actually state any reason for it? Do you actively support stealth patches to mechanics? Do you want to be forced to check up on CCP's site every day, to make sure they haven't made a change?
---
Seriously, the grand topic i decided to bring up in this OP was that a patch happened and nothing is showing a patch happened anymore, 24 hours after it happened. Anyone who was on holiday, or busy with IRL? They get dicked over and the solution is... to be forced to constantly check the eve online site and devblogs? What exactly is the benefit of that versus just having the launcher show a patch happened when a patch happened, and perhaps linking to more information?
---
Cant do the latter as it would be powercreep and cause other balance issues.
---
Why would you post this? Let it be! CCP literally had not one clue until this post.
---
It would be nice to be able to see corp/alliance members in local, maybe even people with good standings.
---
You do realise that titan bridges exist right? That a sceptor can be bridged making the jump time exactly the same? And you are comparing apples and oranges. A sceptor is faster than a carrier in every sense but one, it lacks a jump drive.
---
This is the reason SMALL gangs cant take fights. Thats not an issue because capitals are not meant for small gangs to fight against. 
---
A small gang fighting a small gang with some caps isnt a big disadvantage.
---
Dude, you cant gate them. Whats wrong with you man. You want people to gate caps into fights? You know what happens in such a scenario?
---
Messing with cynos will hurt but defense and offense. Its that simple.
---
Eh ye. Which are the only times caps are being used? I mean, what? Ofc thats the reasons.
---
Na you cant. Thinking you can is the issue. Caps arent the issue, its organisation and manpower. Caps are only dropped to end engagements because we dont want to fight small gangs. Its not fun dude. I get it, people in small gangs think everything should revolve around them but people in NS arent there for the small fights. We are there for the big ones and spending our time chasing nano kikis is like the most boring thing ever. Outside of gatecamps. 
---
If I want to do those things Ill just move back to LS. And people who likes these things can fight in LS today and get those things. Why the need to change NS into LS?
---
Exactly. Because that balance cant be found. And 500 peoples opinion should always outweigh the 5. Its a no brainer my man. Its not breaking the game and its not causing stagnation. In no scenario will the small gang actually make a huge impact. I mean what do you think will happen if you remove cynos? People will just not use the ships. Which means that people wont fight offensively with them and its hard to win big engagements against caps without caps so NS will stop fighting.
---
Is small gang content gonna offset NS warfare somehow? You think you actually kill more than NS? Its going to be a net loss in PvP which means more stagnation. No dude, its not gonna work. Its as simple as that.
---
thanks lad
---
Is it "Good Fight" or "Get Fucked"? Who's to say?
---
Darkness flair using the word 'allies', that's breaking news.
---
It comes back to a user that fails to pay attention game mechanics that are changing and being updated. CCP released these patches and in a separate thread also went on to state that they are changing the way they are doing business. I don’t have the words or the link because I’m at work but basically you can expect random events and things like this to happen more often as they mix up things in their game. Maybe you remember being a noob and not understanding pvp in lowsec or hisec or how duals worked and you lost your most expensive ship because u didn’t know the mechanics. I relate this to that just in the sense that your pvp is probably market pvp and you feel like you just got scammed by CCP. Get over it, just reship and get back to business. We all welp sometimes. 
---
I don’t care at all about the market, I buy plex, pvp, welp ships, buy more. I have ships I don’t even fly. Who cares. Even I knew these changes were coming and long term I expect to see prices on ships going up especially as less rorquals mine with excavators and the armies of hulks stop stripping out entire systems in nullsec in minutes. Big blocks are less effected by this but it’s still going to effect the market. In my opinion this is good because I remember killing supers to be very rare and extremely cool and now it’s like meh. Same with killing faction battleships. It isn’t as exciting as it used to be but now that their value of going up and ppl are more scared to fly them it’s more enjoyable.
---
Give some credit bro.
---
On that note. Why make more ships when the ones we already had were so poorly balanced? Everyone uses the same stale doctrines with only small changes. I want variety, and sure adding new ships will give that, but I want to see older stuff too.
---
Idk what that’s supposed to mean.
---
Darkness. Is the best allies anyone could hope for.
---
"Why doesn't everyone wants a Serenity"?
---
Whilst hi-sec mechanics are broken in one sense, I think they work as intended. 
---
The simple fact is hi-sec is supposed to be 'safe' - it's tutorial mode EVE - and big bullies stomping all over little groups and inviting all their mates to some offensive war on a whim is probably not desirable, because it's going to be oppressive to the 'victim' - their victim invariably being a smaller or weaker group.
---
I think there should be some semblance of security in hi-sec, which the defender advantage and the bizarre mechanics provide. I think the idea is that it's a place for smaller groups to grow and develop - or live out of, as my corp has until now - before they venture into living in low-sec or null and throwing off the safety blanket.
---
gotg couldn't be bothered to join us and have barely ever left their own space for anything, ever
---
Yeah it doesn't matter because you make the same doing anoms in high sec that you do in null sec..... 
---
Still a pretty significant hit to their income. Just because they moved to high sec doesn't mean you reverse what you did already to help address the problem in null sec. That would take you back to square one. You just keep moving forward to address the new issue. 
---
Nice try though.
---
I mean, its not easily done. And very few multibox these numbers. Its a myth. The average rorq miners has perhaps 3 rorqs in my experience. Which still is iskwise lower than 1 super.
---
now that there's no nulli or tribal band, regular pl members get yelled at for being shitters. it's an improvement i guess
---
We did. Hk bailed
---
Space Detroit is the name of a Sotiyo in Tama.
---
What's needed is nerfing the multiboxing aspect of Rorqs, its isk/hr is kinda fine atm.
---
Here's the thing. With insurance as it is right now, destruction is an isk source, not an isk sink. All isk involved in destruction goes TO players. Some of it from players, some of it from the ether.
---
Destruction is not an isk sink.
---
&gt; Panfam going and invading Test
---
negative, retard
---
the conflict started because gigx started hitting mc moons. get your facts straight tia~
---
We decided to go way out of meta and fly something none of us have done since 2010. we knew this was going to be a really hard fight for us.
---
The ashat was bashing us contant with bombs they treid to ECM burst to break our scramchain but we fought through. 
---
Good fight minmill.

Well if 3 regions left and right are blue, go figure.

you skipped the parts where gigx started hitting mc moons, ncdot came to defend them, and tapi decided that "co2 are our friends and we'll die on this hill with them"
---
ironically a year later deciding "gigx is retarded and we're cutting ties with him" for doing literally the exact same shit
---
It's not that people don't think there need to be better sinks. You guys just have bad ideas. T3 ammo? Like what the fuck are you smoking?

There are some FCs that I will not fly with. Just log out or ignore them.

It's called corp and alliance chat.

\&gt;tapi victim complex running at 110%
---
lmao
---
Loosing assets doesnt remove isk from the game.
---
Not like back in the old days when POS's were NPC items. And all POCOs were NPC tax.
---
Also NPC sales taxes used to be highers
---
&gt; Ehhh, i know theres groups with slightly competent members but how many of them A live in null and B are part of a bloc? I can't think of many.
---
the only ones i can really think of rn are frat, but that's solely because(and limited to mind you) the ex-skillu corps that joined such as p3ak(maybe they left?not sure), avanlanche, kyr, etc. Skillu was the pinnacle(i cri every tiem) but yeah, they aint no more. reddit aside I wouldn't be surprised if pl still somewhat could claim it but i dunno. At the end of the day if you limit your search to the area that encourages this kind of behaviour the most yeah, that what you'll get i guess.
---
&gt; And the problem with size is that mindless mass recruiting blew a few alliances just completely out of proportion. If Init is big, what are goons, test or horde?
---
yeah i mean, its a case of how you're gonna define big. I don't think using outliers such as these as measuring sticks tho is a very good idea. imo they're just that, extreme outliers.
---
&gt;250mm rails don't fit: so put on smaller rails that can track better.
---
Doesnt matter as they still dont track well enough. 200mm rails = 10 tracking, 150mm = 15. The smaller ones also have range and damage issues.
---
&gt;Mod slots: what's holding you back? Pwg, cpu, total slots? Should be possible.
---
You cant gimp that much as you then lose to another VNI. It also doesnt matter because the base tracking is simply too low.
---
&gt;Normal Harb: ok? That has no bearing on the conversation at hand.
---
It does because it shows the difference in tracking.
---
You think that +1-3% total dps would be game breaking in comparison to drugs giving 1/3/5/7 % ?
---
&gt;panfam victim complex running at 110%
---
No, but I have saved a few of his bookmarks while flying with him.
---
Dude is hilariously good at what he does.
---
Particularly when there is a conflict of interest. Other than that, it's actually very easy in most cases.
---
So it's taken a year and a half just to get to the conclusion everybody else made at that time, no wonder you guys are so far behind with leadership like that.
---
It's in K space, you can't "strand" attackers because they won't take ships they plan to bring home.
---
grrr bombers bar
---
Older NPCs simply don't follow the rules. There's rats with 9+ turrets also using missiles, torpedoes that hit anywhere on grid, lock and ewar from 10k+ away(like when the rats are on a different gate on grid). There's a lot of things about them that are predictable but make little sense.
---
Regardless, rattlesnakes have the potential to be among the tankiest subcaps in the game. You are probably in need of a new fit.
---
&lt;3
---
I'd like the possibility to roll into C4 and above with these things but limited to subcaps only for an occasional wormhole raid.
---
Thank you ! Looking forward to gank your next rolling bs or mining barge !
---
I can dock in tapi citadel's?
---
Theres a lot of info on the subject and you have to ask about specific things as you progress. But in general the isk isnt that great. Its no where near double or triple can tell you that. I honestly dont think any such margins exist because if it did people would start doing it right away thereby lowering the margin very fast.
---
But, ill give you some advice.
---
Modules tend to be T2 which requires completely different things than T1. So what you can do is to make sub hulls and then import the T2 stuff and sell doctrine ships. That will get you some good isk.
---
Many rorq miners also produce caps/supers/titans. Ofc depending on the scale of your mining. But even with 1 you will quickly notice that its far easier to just sell one cap than 20 doctrine ships. So you can sell just cap hulls or import the stuff you cant build and sell doctrine caps.
---
The reason nobody uses them is because it goes counter to being able to krab in safety. Having a wormhole pop up in your system that connects you to a hostile entity is too much of a risk while you're trying to AFK mine or runs sites. . 
---
I think the original thought process was that wormholes were going to be similar to the way Abyssals are now. People weren't live in them, they daytripped to run sites and make ISK. The quantum flux generator provided more opportunity for connections to these mysterious systems to make ISK. Players pretty much blew that out of the water when they started living in them using POSes. Now they're more of a threat than an opportunity to make ISK.
---
Calling a stealth patch over and over doesnt make it true. It's not a patch it's a setting change. The devblog even said effective immediately.
---
You may be too young to remember but back when CCP used to announce changes they had to keep details low and short notice because the second they announced there would be a run on the markets due to speculation 
---
I dont see how higher NPC taxes dicked someone over for not logging in.
---
I conclude that you sir.... are a fool and should be ignored
---
&gt;If you want Serenity in medium to long run and choke out the content, say it instead of clinging to a very biased and old narrative. Everyone's fought everyone at this point mate.
---
Imagine lacking awareness this much.
---
Why not
---
&gt;On that note. Why make more ships when the ones we already had were so poorly balanced?
---
I would love for CCP to come here to justify it, but I guess they can't because there is no reason that the non-retarded part of the community would buy.
---
Tbh it's always been like that. El Gobberino IS the puppet master.
---
gfgf
---
was a hard grid to fight on
---
Literally nothing
---
Not what i was saying but if these alliances who constantly cry now that they aren't the top dogs put some effort into making their alliances decent places to play the game there wouldn't be such a massive difference in membership numbers.
---
They're not bringing in a significant % of the raw isk. They're bringing in LP and resources. It will just weaken hisec against moving more of the game's economic base to Delve / Esoteria, which is overall awful for the health of the game and for new players.
---
"Buy a rorq toon or 5" is not good advice for newbros, sorry.
---
Particularly for new players seeking to become traders, OR even for smaller established players, that &lt;1.5% is significant. For newer players if they know that a potential 1.5% tax break is available - over time that would actually influence the decision pretty definitively. Even for an established player, there would be ostensible incentive to at least test the waters even if it equates to only 1 billion in a year. Again it wouldn't actually be about the raw isk, its the raw min/max gameplay (haha)
---
I think it quite clear that with the knowledge of the 1.5% or similar value discount you will see changes to behaviour - and thats the point. Need a new mix up.
---
Has anyone noticed how the panfam narrative is always 'side with us, those other dudes are killing content and choking the game'
---
So russian botters still own all of c6 space?
---
It's hard to let go.
---
Thanks alot!
---
Why is your answer to your problems never 'I could try being better' it might work out better for you than 'everyone should come down in the gutter with me for the sake of the game'
---
Whadda ya talking about they aint no more? Word is out that Skillu is gonna form an open world pvp guild on the EU server of Classic WoW.  
---
And i get your point about outliers but heres the thing: even among these goons are an extreme outlier again so it's really hard to tell at which point a size is an outlier and at which it is defining.
---
Isn't the point of "Serenity" that a **single** group/coalition controls the entire map? If goons and panfam are splitting the map, it would only be "Serenity" if they were strategically aligned with each other...
---
Are suggesting New Eden is the place for joyous love and happy times?
---
Boxes? Are you talking about cargo? Sorry still new to this :/
---
And they're not, so I guess we're not Serenity.
---
Ok good to know Thanks! I will lookup how to make a jump clone when I get on later!
---
Because it's been hugely beneficial to both parties. Goons get to add extended deployment capabilities to the coalition, Init get a secure resource base.
---
Bo seems to think that we should be homogeneous with the rest of the coalition (IE: that we should do what goons want, when they want it, the way they want it), but that completely fails to recognise the  value that the current heterogeneity brings. Or that that's not a relationship we would contemplate.
---
Except you've always asked for a 1v1, you obviously want content.. but your corp won't fight us. I don't get it.
---
Here is a novel idea. Set netral standings for one fight. Agree to it in advance. Set timer of reset start and reset end. Agree not to ratget each other's supers, if things come to that. Use separate comms if that is a possible issue. Don't head shot each other's FCs. Enjoy the fight. No? Too alien an idea? Pity. We use it quite a lot even with our besties. Works really well.
---
there is one thing that has most definitely changed. Sotiyos are significantly harder to threaten/kill than supercap producing POS' were, which decreases the risk on building them. 
---
Attacking an enemy supercap POS was a conflict driver before.. when was the last time you heard about a sotiyo being attacked outside of an actual war?
---
You are correct. The end result is the same, just multiplied. Up to the breakeven point those extra alts will only cost you but after that your profit will be tenfold.
---
It's because you're not giving them enough time to playtest and min/max it before it hits live. Don't you know that it needs to be completely solved before it goes live?
---
Great tips! Thanks alot! Who would you personally recommend corp wise?
---
People no likey. Ill upvote, it was funny and in line with the times.
---
Yeah it's what kept me away for so long, but I had a great time yesterday and plan on playing more today.
---
It's not the job of a player to constantly have to chase the developer to answer the question "has there been an update?". A game where changes are made and you have to scour the website (or worse, developers' twitter accounts) to know there even has been an update is IMO just an overall terrible experience that will drag whatever actual game experience there is down into the mud.
---
And again, you move back to "this change is good" and talking about the in-game mechanics. This isn't about any of that. This is about the communication from the company to its players. What changes are made is irrelevant here, but the fact that there are changes, or have been changes recently, is important. Players need to be informed that something has changed if you want changes to work out well, otherwise you get a shift where the minority of most hardcore players are aware of changes and use them and everyone else is caught unaware, potentially dicked over by game mechanics that changed out from under them without notice.
---
CCP is changing how they do things. They're doing things in a shorter term now, from announcement to release. That's fine, but there's no reason to hide the fact "hey we updated, something changed" 24 hours after the patch went live.
---
&gt;is usually profitable.
---
Even if you pay no attention and are just looking at the overview to warp off when rats show up, you're still probably going to survive. You can fit two sites' worth of gas ninja into a Venture's ore hold with room to spare.
---
So annoying, like docking fees but worse
---
Can we plz not
---
Thanks,
---
All level 5 apart from cap. Industrial ships which is lv 4 and 20ish days from being level 5.
---
The only way I think I could up the isk other than that last level is with drone navs, but I'm sticking to full tank build until I've survived a few harasses or bombing runs and I'm fully  comfortable
---
As a risk adverse hi-sec citizen I'm ok with this. Make it like 10k a jump and free for the first 30 days to help newbros
---
we had that, a few years ago, when ccp tinkered with warp speeds last time.  
---
Interdictors and ceptors were so fast with deceleration that they appeared instant, and when your client made the next 1hz refresh you were sitting next to a dictor that had a bubble already popped. There was no way to click the warp button fast enough, even when you hovered over it and knew what was coming.  
---
So they settled for a middle ground and got rid of instant deceleration.  
---
Example video from sisi back then:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdQRyRZur8U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdQRyRZur8U)
---
Lol didnt know that.
---
Yeah friends came in handy in Elite so I am sure even more so in EvE :D
---
Docking fees should happen. Keep the players undocked. Maximise the time between docking.
---
All these people talking about artillery and rifters.
---
Smartbombs are the winning method for this contest! The hard part is getting warpin close enough to the rat (3 km).
---
Nah, fcon decided to be retarded and stood with solar/xix instead of us.
---
Never seen your group fight unless you have at least twice as many as the other group, have watched you guys run away/ dock and log plenty though
---
Soggy baguette
---
Ok Thanks :) 
---
I'll have to remember the Sisters of Eve Arc. Gotta do more research!
---
I dont know man, Tarnak Inc. was a small pvp corp living in a c2 and we got evicted by HOSA over a 6 week siege (J120455). We didn't even have a fortizar (one of their boy wanted the wh for his personal use). Then our C5 a few years after because WHBOO (scary wh ppl) helped a random loser corp get the wh. So based on my many years of experience as a small wh pvp corp providing content, your affirmation is a lie.
---
Then you would know when we're bluefucking you. I like it better when you don't know friendlies are scouting you.
---
It’ll worth a lot more than 5b for veteran players because the sp is directly added to the character.
---
I like it
---
The clone systems are the biggest that need changes. 
---
Clones need better organizing tools. The destroy button should not be the same size and shape as the jump button with an almost identical warring if the clone has no implants. It is just a noob trap, should be a red trash can icon in the top right of the ui panel. Jumping when not in your training clone should not destroy your clone. I should not need to hit install every time I jump to forward staging.
---
A deployment should be able to pay for a office in a station and add extra clone bays for a cost. If they choose to use a astrahause it should cost fuel to run extra clone bays.
---
I agree with keepstars needing a size limit, ccp said it was always some thing they wanted. An alliance should not be able to hold there whole coalitions super fleet in one keep star.
---
Eve allows you to run however many accounts you want to throw at the game. So some individuals run multiple account (boxes) while some players just run one.
---
&gt;Edit : fun fact, a C4 corp was also in the attackers (Avanto) :p
---
\&gt;again   
---
???
---
What are you even smoking? You can undock from any station and just go to a combat site and pop the first frigate. Why would you even need a second account or 5B investment? I undocked from my main station and had a combat site less than 1AU away.
---
not sure i follow. are you saying that me pointing out how hilarious it is that literally everything tapi has done since 2016 is because "BUT WHAT IF PANFAM COMES BACK," is a victim complex on my part?
---
2 large megacoalations staring at each other across the map. I don't see a problem with this.
---
We're in the endgame now.
---
never said fcon were smart, just that tapi are hypocrites
---
Exactly!
---
&gt; More like panfam just can't stand losing. "Serenity" was never a problem when panfam and goons split the map.
---
You basically prove that there was a balance before the 2016/2017 patches between PvP-Heavy-Groups and Builder-Type-Groups. So if CFC had half of the map, i do not see the "oppressiveness" of PanFam Supers or passive moon mining that so many people in TAPIRIUM now refer to. What I see is that these patches weaponized autism of people not playing but grinding this game, leaving no chance for casual groups actually playing actively and not multiboxing AFK-Mining-Capitals ...
---
It was inevitable more than funny.
---
And they weren't, which explains why 
---
&gt;"Serenity" was never a problem when panfam and goons split the map.
---
Sounds like HK fucked up and got their panties in a twist over it.
---
How would T3 ammo be different than T2 though?  What makes it T3?  T3 is defined by being adaptable in some way (subsystems or “modes”).
---
Oh Ok! I would just be running the one for now! Is there a purpose with running more than one?
---
Don't you guys have dronelands systems to krab in?
---
I didn't see it much outside of actual wars when I was doing it in POSes either. 
---
But the mechanics of requiring the owning sov to build the things made was indeed more limiting. 
---
But ya, soytios were a mistake on a lot of levels because they're just nerfed keepstars... which is a fundamental change. But if the changes to capitals was the drive to increase building, it was happening already happening when soytios came out. My first reaction to soytios? "Wtf would I get one of those?"... then the time penalty on POSes was announced.
---
I didnt say no-one did. But as a percentage, those that evict for no reason other than loot are a small number of the total.
---
It is a ihub related upgrade... install in 3 systems and have 3 times bigger chance of getting any useful connection.
---
oh im well aware of that))
---
&gt;it's really hard to tell at which point a size is an outlier and at which it is defining.
---
the vast majority of somewhat active alliances are still far smaller than these. Outliers are naturally anomalous so comparing one outlier with another in this context(as in, the context where they *are* outliers, and not regular data points) its a losing battle. But again, that's a discussion of arbitrary definitions at its core so v0v
---
More like you want CCP to change the rules because you now have to live with the consequences of your shitty political plays.

But couldn't you have secured such a ressource base on your own? I mean you guys are pretty strong and i don't think there would have been a group capable of evicting you *and* having genuine beef with you. Feel free to correct me on that though, admittedly i never cared enough about you guys to keep an eye on all the red strings and i know there can be a lot of these in this game.
---
In the same vein, an npc station probably shouldn't be able to hold 100-150 dreads in their current size iteration.
---
Hello, fairly new player here.
---
How safe are jumpgates in lowsec systems? I know they have guns that will shoot up lawbreakers, but I have no clue how strong those guns are. 
---
Trying to find out if I can at least rest easy knowing someone that ganks you at one probably lost their ship too, or if they likely can safely get away.
---
this was already the case in UALX when they got dicked on.
---
lets also talk about "if you give a good fight, we wont evict you". When a big wh group rolls into your home, they will send 4 cloaky sabre in your system to talk shit and tell "my pussy corp" to undock in local chat. any attempt to scout will result in a dead cov op frig. And no, we wont undock a fleet blind without knowing what other side could bring. So basically your asking us to sacrifice to bob some nice ships so we don't get evicted.
---
I was just laughing about this. PL founds Horde to be their newbie pets. Fast forward a couple years and Horde is running the show, while Pandemic Legion is fading into irrelevance as a sort of Horde-affiliated retirement home for bittervets. It weirdly gives me warm fuzzy feelings, even though Horde still sucks compared to all other big newbie corps.
---
The problem isn't *isk* per hour. It's materials. 
---
Ratting gets you pure isk. With rorqual mining and infinite anomalies you wind up literally printing supers.
---
Yes!
---
UALX was a mutual defense situation
---
People are complaining that youre not doing the right things. Like leaving the Rorq the way it is for 3 years and its still not 100%. Or fozziesov. Nobody really had an issue with taxes but that change hit very fast.
---
So yay for rapid changes, but atleast somewhere in the vicinity of things that actually need fixing.
---
Just record without heavy encoding :D.
---
Lossless video takes shit ton of disk space but recording it requires very little processing power.
---
Or use GPU for encoding.
---
Well this is the cost to fill up ship tanks with oxygen and stores with food.

Aka who cares.

i'm sure it's going to be very hard to scale up their operation using those cost prohibitive free accounts!
---
Hey now, PANIC doesn't make you invincible, it just gives you an EHP of 23 billion, perfectly fine duh.
---
&gt;Calling a stealth patch over and over doesnt make it true.
---
No a stealth patch is a stealth patch because it's kept hidden. If you launch the game after being away a week, you won't know there was a patch because said information was hidden from the launcher already.
---
What constitutes a stealth patch to you, then? painted black and held up against the night sky?
---
&gt;The devblog even said effective immediately.
---
Incorrect, the devblog stated "that will be made soon".
---
&gt;I dont see how higher NPC taxes dicked someone over for not logging in.
---
if someone logs in to the game after a holiday, moves some things out of industry/pi/etc and sells things at a loss compared to previous profits, they got dicked over.
---
Let me turn this around on you. I'm posting stating that making these changes be invisible so soon after patch is bad. You state i am wrong and am a fool, while basically ignoring the fact that there are negative points to the actions CCP has taken with this patch's communication. So what, in your opinion, is the upside to not informing players a change was made recently if they open the launcher? What is the benefit?

I don't know what service you're using but I've always found that the general latency + packetloss to be poor for EVE which only uses a single TCP connection for all of its communications. Depending on where you're flying from/to that might also involve bouncing back to the other side of the world.

In one case the airline used T-Mobile Germany and so you had to go from the plane, to the satlink, then back down to Germany - even though we were flying over the US. It was terrible - good enough to browse mlite websites or check e-mail, not good enough for gaming.

I see T3 ammo as LP ammo (so it continues to use up LP) that is turned in + isk and comes out with +1-5 % damage buff. Much like a consumable drug. It simply is a better ammo at a higher price. It in no way needs or uses plex, it's not pay to win, it's just a higher cost ammunition. Example: Republic Phased Plasma goes for around 1k in Jita currently, let's say the cost of the round would be an additional 2000 isk flat when turned into the LP NPC. 
---
In this terminology for T3 I am using it as the third tier (Tier 3) of ammunition. That is how the name T3 came about, the third iteration of a ship line.
---
They are not safe. The guns are there to provide you with an edge in combat, but they won't harm a fleet or anything bigger than a cruiser. They certainly won't kill them before they kill you. And they don't point people, so your attackers can just warp out when their hit points get low.
---
Several members of large blocs have already been caught input broadcasting with Rorqs. It won't matter if you increase the interactions. They just have to press the button once.
---
First  of all who are you exactly and what corp do you belong to?
---
So they changed the meta by reinforcing it even more?
---
Im not arguing that perhaps the overall changes will do good but change for the sake of change isnt good. Which kinda is the vibe people are getting. That this is a shotgun method to see what sticks instead of starting where the issues lie.

Effort wise is a huge difference. Not to mention Rorqs have their "Save me" button and an invuln shield to hold them until help arrives. You catch a super in a site and they don't have nearly the same survival chance.
---
My IQ has decreased significantly after reading the comments on this post
---
Change of the sake of change is never good longterm.
---
use angel ships
---
It's all about scalability. You can have n number of rorqs and maybe 5% profit decrease if you're bad vs anything else. It's totally afk. 80-100 mil an hour is on average so take 80-100 mil an hour time n and you'll end up with printing dreads/carrier/faxes every how quickly moving up to supers and titans

Didn't take long looking over zkill VNI losses...  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78164735/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78164735/) 
---
The kills he gets minutes prior is in this ship. He does a good bit of damage with the guns. Fit could probably be tweaked some more and they were fighting a losing battle but still, he didn't seem to have issues tracking.
---
&gt; Doesn't matter as they still dont track well enough. 200mm rails = 10 tracking, 150mm = 15. The smaller ones also have range and damage issues. 
---
10,15 are pretty good tracking base with all those bonuses. bonus from ammo depending on the type you use, if you have cruiser 5 you get 50% right off the top. You should have motion prediction 5... helps so much. add a tracking comp in the mids or a enhancer in the lows... i mean. that's a good bit more bonus and I wouldn't be surprised if you can do it without gimping it. Make it a kite boat with fast medium drones... that's niche but you don't like the brawler aspect.
---
Not to mention these have better range and damage then their medium focused beam counterparts and I have never had issues with beam range. Although I also don't expect it to hit to 100km without some help locally or remotely from a few tracking computers. unless we are talking Tachyons but you couldn't hit the broad side of a barn from the inside with those unless you are already 100km away.
---
&gt; You cant gimp that much as you then lose to another VNI. It also doesnt matter because the base tracking is simply too low. 
---
So build your VNI brawler... You can't win every battle with one ship. fit the ship to the fight you hope for and go kill some shit. Anything small and fast you have drones, Anything larger you have some railgun support...
---
&gt;Normal Harb: ok? That has no bearing on the conversation at hand.  
---
&gt;It does because it shows the difference in tracking.
---
I mean... No, it has no bearing on this comparison. It shows a standard ship with no bonuses. We are currently comparing two ships that provide tracking bonuses aren't we? not the base Vexor. Not to mention the example i provided only provides 3/4 the tracking bonus the VNI does.
---
This legit sounds like you're embracing the game going to hell with your only goal being to have the most blues when that happens....
---
you dont have local, which means no one sees you on intel and no one forms for you so theres only ganking which is the most boring risk averse style of pvp. not my fault youre a balless scrub
---
Ok Thanks for the help!
---
Used to be, but ladt I put an alt n uni I must say that things have changed, and not for the better
---
Docking fees DID happen, you clearly never lived in null sec pre-citadels. It was awful. Imagine an extra pop-up window every single time you docked.
---
Rude Jonathan
---
Meh you're right, at this point this is really more about subjective definitions. And yeah, maybe i really stretched my initial point. Maybe i just dislike goons so much that it's hard for me to compare anyone to them (besides tapi maybe, they're terrible too)
---
Its worth more than before with plex price, the volta hubs and the tax increase and all the bots gone. Isk is worth 25% more than last month. If you cant figure out  how to do it drop me a pm and I will happily give you advice and fits.
---
I remember the first time I tried exploration I didn't know pinpointing was a thing so I spent about half an hour with the spread formation trying to scan down a single site.
---
What the blind fuck is that piece of shit gonna be called, hurf the turf coalition?
---
&gt;You do realise that titan bridges exist right? That a sceptor can be bridged making the jump time exactly the same?
---
If there is no fix to cynos, there is likely no fix to titans. Once something is broken enough to be unplayable, it doesnt matter how much unplayable.
---
&gt;This is the reason SMALL gangs cant take fights. Thats not an issue because capitals are not meant for small gangs to fight against. 
---
Capitals are not meant to be everywhere, but now that it is the case, you need to nerf cynos since caps have obsoleted many other ships to the point of making the game unplayable.
---
&gt;A small gang fighting a small gang with some caps isnt a big disadvantage.
---
Its an enormous disadvantage. You might as well escape and log.
---
&gt;Messing with cynos will hurt but defense and offense. Its that simple.
---
Which is necessary.
---
&gt;Caps arent the issue, its organisation and manpower. 
---
Its actually injectors, rorqs, zero risk because cynos, and massive amounts of isk. We could nerf all of it, but focusing on cynos seems to be the most effective.
---
&gt;If I want to do those things Ill just move back to LS. And people who likes these things can fight in LS today and get those things. Why the need to change NS into LS?
---
LS is completely dead outside of certain systems like Ama, Kour, Nenne and some others.
---
&gt;Exactly. Because that balance cant be found. And 500 peoples opinion should always outweigh the 5. 
---
It can easily be found, but it has never been tried because quite frankly CCP is totally clueless when it comes to balancing.
---
The correct opinion is at the very least one that can justify the changes. These 500 or 5000 people cant. Most are retarded when it comes to balance if that balance impacts their gameplay, which it would because that gameplay is killing the game. Most of them just crab anyway.

How to dunk trit prices past 2016 levels 101
---
r/beetlejuicing ?
---
If Horde sucks compared to ‘all other big newbie corps’ then why do all solo/small gang/streamer fleets frequent there?
---
It’s clearly because they do in fact have the best newbies.
---
I'm very much of the opinion that the Rorqual and Orca need substantial changes, but I don't work for development.
---
Hopefully that change will come and we'll see the ships used differently :)
---
What is your ISK making method now with the blackout?
---
To whoever is downvoting me; please speak up and tell me what positives you see with a developer not making it clear a patch happened recently. I've explained the downsides a number of times now. Nobody has said why moving information about a recent patch away from players right after said patch is a good thing.
---
Not disagreeing here but saying multiboxing 20 Rorqs is easily done is saying 1, its easy, which its not. 2. People do it, some, very few yes. But thats rare. People on this sub think all NS consists of are 20 rorq multiboxers. Me personally, Ive only seen a couple. 
---
Using an anomaly as the standard in discussions is the same as saying 260m ticks is why supers need nerfing.
---
Who cares about Panfam, seriously?
---
By the look of it, you've been ganked by a couple of stratios and pissed when your 30man armor fleet couldnt get a fight. 
---
Well, idk who you fly with, but we tend to give gf most of time, and to gank whatever we can. 
---
We get happilly welp now and then, and happilly welp other people when we can.
---
I ll be happy to give a gf next time we are in chain.
---
your right, though I  am not sure how you would manage that without it being easily bypassable or abusable. Limit the size of the station and an alliance will purposely fill it, to avoid it being used as a dread cache. Limit its size on a corp level then people will just make out of corp alts.
---
Lol have you ever left delve before?
---
nibba what? fountain was test vs goon. you mean WWB and immediately after the goon fucked off for delve from lowsec pan and then fam turned on test in vale. it was even suggested that we "let PL farm us for a while, it'll be fine". so GTFO with your revisionist shit that you claim to remember.
---
I do miss contact alerts letting me know when it's time to bait you tho
---
OK, so whats the solution then? everyone balkanizes their territories and splits their military forces up? for what? because you don't like how they're playing the game? 
---
There is no going back from this. this is like the cold war era on crack. 2 large super powers standing off against each other, waiting for the other one to make a move. there's nothing anyone can do now except enjoy the ride.
---
i didn' think i could find someone braindead.
---
no im not a idiot i just respect mittens
---
The newbies are just as great at all of them. Newbies are fine. They all have that Zen child-mind "EVE is actually a fun video game" thing going.
---
Its the vets running the show that distinguish them from one another.
---
Huh I never knew Delve was located in the north.
---
&gt;level 2
---
To be fair, I would rate Fedup to have a higher level of skill of their avg player compared to goons :\].
---
All for it. I do hope the overall effects of the changes will be a positive for the game and not just a year of fk NS that in the end yields nothing but lower pop and no real changes to the mechanics that currently make life tedious in NS.
---
Cause that would seriously hurt the game.
---
I loved this ship man. I loved this multipurpose brick. The only ship i ever grew attached to was a Proteus. I even used one as support ship in the propably biggest golden fleet ever.
---
&gt; Timing ends when the locked NPC is destroyed. 
---
Smartbombs don't appear to be permissible per the rules of how they time the kill.
---
HOSA only do evictions, Odins don't really do wh fights. So bad example, tdsin was probably the mini structure bashing corp that goes around bashing low power shit. In general if you do actually undock for PvP and get on good terms with other groups you're safer, and will have people willing to help you.
---
I just came back to the game and was wondering if solo roaming null sec as a stealth bomber works? My main target would be ratters and industrial ships. 
---
Is this something that could work or a bad idea.
---
not to give you any ideas but if I was goon, I would claim Thera and keep hole control in it 24/7. I dont see any better home for a 30k + player alliance to live in. This would provide you with insane amount of connections and great mobility for subcap fleets (can thera have vlarge wh to bring caps in?)
---
Who actually chats in local?
---
-WH'er btw
---
A lot of us would love to go to war with Goons (including me). God that would be an epic war.
---
But yes, I fucking hate PL and welcome the opportunity to kick their teeth in again. If I have to side with Goons to do it, well, that's fine with me.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
CCP have always, always nerfed and never buffed other ships in the same class. It's too much work. But congrats on your post karma. This now means the Kiki will get nerfed to the ground and no one will use it after that.
---
finally a good post from havish
---
If you deflect it to a per person cost, it at least becomes a burden to bear. I do not personally envision an upkeep or tax system on a monthly basis as being a good thing. That's the quickest way to make the game feel like a job or real life.. reoccurring bills to pay just to play.
---
Ahhh yeah.
---
I mean, they basically lie as hard as they can to make the game look like something it's not in every bit of promotional material they release.  Then they're :surprisedpikachu: when player retention is abyssmal.  Almost as if marketing a game as something it's not will lead to  low retention...
---
Sounds like fun.  
---
Let’s drive TEST and Goons closer and closer against a more unified enemy.  
---
I for one look forward to more joint ops with my TEST bros  but actually find it hard to believe that PanFam has any interest in anything more offensive.
---
I'm curious how you make 120m/hr in HS incursions. Is there a guide somewhere?
---
My wife is amazing at, and loves working on, spreadsheets. I told her eve is perfect for her. She could be a market trading manufacturing boss.  I have tried and failed to get her into eve, she will just continue watching reruns of The OC and How to Get Away with Murder....

We didn't need to know he finished before you guys read a reddit post together.  Also, why do you know that?
---
Risk adverse hunters/spies?!?   I never!
---
More seriously, I miss the social aspect of local, chatting with whatever randoms are around as I do my thing.
---
Hmmm so weird. That system died during CSM X...
---
I just started playing and I've had really good interactions with people in the game thus far. It's an online game with competitive aspects so you're going to have douchebags but in general people really try to help grow the community so the game doesn't die; I'm loving it so far!
---
and they wonder why potential players don't stick around when every trailer is the complete opposite of how the game actually plays.  Rocket surgery, I tell ya
---
Corp chat?
---
Only if your alliance charged you. Our rates were free to members.
---
It's a whole lot harder than you make it seem. Anoms in high sec don't regenerate anywhere near what they do in null. It would take a whole lot of bots parked in a ton of systems to even come close to what they were making in null. Not to mention the competition from other high sec site runners. They didn't have that in null. 
---
Then you have to consider the number of accounts they can run on whatever setup they're using. Just because they can make a lot of Alpha accounts doesn't mean they can run all of them. 
---
A lot of the botters are just there to make money through RMT. At a certain point the return isn't worth the investment. Same as Bitcoin mining. Once your return is low enough or you start going negative, then there's no longer an incentive to keep doing it. 
---
You just can't see the forest for the trees man. You also don't want to believe it because you want to keep spinning your own narrative about how much it's failed and lost players, etc. Reality check, it hasn't and there's a lot more positive to come from it then not.
---
They just do7bled tax across the board, perhaps calm your tits and see waht happens.
---
Train Corp management to 1
---
I've got more craziness to come.

nah, heck with that.

Wormholes need to remain that sort of speciality place and specialty profession where people who don't 'click' with the rest of the game can go.
---
Picachu face

I mean, you could technically use it to see how many sigs are in system...ya know, before they made them all show up automatically.  ::CCP::

Gg very fun brawl tbh

You get 70mil/h mining in a almost free venture on a signature that has to be scanned down.
---
The warp speed of my freighter gives my webbing alt time to lose aggression timer...
---
We have Faction ammo that, guess what, takes LP. It's better than T1 ammo and in some ways better than T2 ammo depending on what you're using it for.
---
Lmao you're an idiot
---
You don't seem to understand the proportions. The only thing people wait on is who goons decide to steamroll next. They could do it to anyone. They could even do it to you. And they will do it one day if noone else is left. The only pupose of the last wars goons have been fighting was to keep their people interested.  
---
Don't get me wrong, i'll be the first one to order massive supplies of popcorn and cheer when Test finally "gets to lie in the bed they made themselves". I'm just worried what comes after that because i for one don't anticipate the death of the game with open arms.
---
are you actually thinking about the idea of sort being in the coalition? Anyone willing to be in a coalition with sort is asking to be back stabbed.
---
Correct. This does not change that. It is simply an idea to offer an isk sink and use faction ammo to upgrade to superior faction ammo.
---
When u leave ur corp as ceo it will give u options who can be the next ceo, so ur alt should have holding corp skills
---
&gt;10,15 are pretty good tracking base with all those bonuses. 
---
It's utterly irrelevant since you need to be able to hit small things. You can barely do that with 25 tracking that you get on the pulse harb.
---
&gt;bonus from ammo depending on the type you use
---
What? You mean javelin? Good luck hitting anything outside 15km with 150mm rails.
---
&gt;add a tracking comp in the mids or a enhancer in the lows... i mean. that's a good bit more bonus and I wouldn't be surprised if you can do it without gimping it. Make it a kite boat with fast medium drones... that's niche but you don't like the brawler aspect.
---
I can totally see that to a "beginner" it seems like you may have a lot of viable options. However, this is simply not the case. The margin between winning and losing is in same cases non-existent. Anything that deviates from "basically optimal for the intended purpose" means you die.
---
&gt;I mean... No, it has no bearing on this comparison. It shows a standard ship with no bonuses. 
---
The bonus doesnt matter if the RESULT is simply inadequate, and it is just that on the VNI. It would need a 100% bonus to be seen as "bad". You need to be able to project 3-400 dps to 20-25km to be able to not auto-die to 2-3 afs. If you cant do this, that ship will not be considered.
---
&gt;o
---
Yeah I realise, I just though we were talking about "ideas" and chimed in with mine...
---
I suppose I could give it a try, but :effort:
---
Been working on it. Easier said than done
---
I could say that people who don't like the added difficulty of having no local are risk averse. See how that works?
---
Fam didnt turn on TEST, TEST inserted itself into a conflict between c02 and Panfam. Before that, Panfam and TEST were neutrals, not allies, not enemies. Gigx did what he does and drama ensued, for the same kind of drama helped killed C02 a year later.
---
I hope this is true and not a ruse.
---
No wonder you got evicted with that spodbrain mentality lmao
---
I just had a thought -
---
What happens when people who take eve far too seriously end up joining bots to alliances just to get them banned and hurt their coffers?
---
You have a fit that's immune to blops droppers? Because that's the real issue here. - Roaming gangs are actually less of a threat now then they used to be, so countering that isn't necessary. The thing that has become very OP is blops, and aside from having a very strong counter-drop ready to drop in the &gt;10 second window of opportunity blops present (which small groups typically don't have the manpower for) I have yet to find a counter that will actually work.
---
*(And no, higgs/pre-align fits, combat refits and whatever other nonense PVP people like to throw around here aren't the magic bullets of protection the like to pretend they are. I've actually tried a shitload of different things like that.)*
---
&gt; Isk is worth 25% more than last month.  
---
The need to have strong defense fleets up and fitting shit defensively has easily cut ratting revenue down into a sixth of what it used to be. The fact that PLEX prices are fluctuating down a bit at the moment, while the bots re-adjust, means very little in comparison.
---
Wut? 1 coalition is like 1/4th or 1/5th of the size of the other. What are you smoking.
---
You're not understanding what they're saying.   There are some corps that will just shit on you, as they did to you.  But you didn't get shit on by corps that don't/wouldn't do that, which is why you didn't get evicted by them.  Your experience in no way disproves what the guy was saying.
---
That would be absurdly annoying.
---
Its not broken. Its working exactly as intended. Nobody is forcing you to interact with cynos, like at all.
---
No I agree, they shouldnt be everywhere. But you dont fix something small by breaking something big. You just fix the small thing. Limit where they can be used, as I said, LS should be able to drop caps everywhere.
---
It really isnt, ive killed enough caps in small gang comps to know. And so have many many many others. They can for fucks sakes even be soloed by subs. If they were oppressive that would never happen.
---
No its not. Wont ever be. 
---
No its not. Those affect but you think you would stand a chance against a 15k organized alliance as a five man group? You wouldnt, it never was that way and will never be that way.
---
No way, there are tons of areas filled with people. I have personally fought in plenty more systems than you are describing. But there is an issue with LS. It needs to be fixed so more are there so small gangs can find content.
---
Dude, there isnt one. There used to be, WWB was an example of what could happen with balance. But after Rorqs/injectors that balance got destroyed. There isnt a way back from what. Its 3 years ago, you cant just turn back the time, instead you have to adapt to it and build for the future. And there is no real future for content in NS for small gangs. Not without breaking NS. And if you do that then people will just leave NS and it will become the old old Eve where people just made isk in HS and nobody was really living in NS.
---
There is no middleground here. Unfortunately.
---
Most dont krab dude, just look at zkill. Look at all the fights. Im seeing full fleets multiple times a day. Some, very few, krab too much. But the average player does both, nothing wrong with that.
---
Ah ok thanks!
---
I think the main point being made is that Rorqs can scale much better than supers, are a fraction of the cost, and can be used with almost no effort or risk.
---
Thank you!
---
If you use missile disruption, they shouldn't be able to do much damage at all with their main weapons, then it's a matter of having support to defang the drones.
---
show us
---
i like it
---
Still just adding more shit on top of other shit that you don't really need.
---
i think you talking about NC dock and PL ;)
---
Got it. You don't like any of the ideas and your contribution to the discussion is a less than polite. Thanks anyway.
---
I mean, it's not bad...but it's not really good either
---
Just ideas my man, just ideas.
---
need that smoothness
---
you can literally just have it be part of the installation costs though...like...this materials solution makes less sense for no benefit.
---
Coming in together from the same side and just defang the carriers. But you chose to seperatly come in and warp directly away with the first loss so you couldn't even distract the fighters not to mention pause the citadel by any means.
---
No retard, i am very much talking about the fountain war. I am very much talking about test vs goons. But Test members these days seem to either have forgotten about this or joined after it.  
---
Back then it was goons who not just evicted test but also chased them over half the map to make sure they wouldn't find a new home in null.  
---
You seem to have forgotten that panfam weren't the only people that shit all over you in the past. And that the only ones that ever evicted Test were the CFC. Your beef with panfam being the more recent one doesn't make that any less true.
---
Completely agree :)
---
Just like a certain square in 1989 where nothing happened
---
Another victim of grath and hedliner :((((( poor you
---
Your responses show you have absolutely no idea how zkill tabulates statistics.
---
uh?
---
I understand the main point. I just dont like the hyperbole. If one wants to explain something one can do it without creating/enforcing a myth. 
---
And the main point is yes, Rorqs scale well. People tend to have a couple yes. But a couple is still less isk than a super with a bit less work and more safety (can be debated tho). 
---
This is the reality of things, no need to obfuscate it.
---
we weren't really in a coalition, just bluetral neighbors. when goons came to hakonen they deployed south to defend, but during the pure blind campaign they basically just sat back and let co2 throw themselves into the meatgrinder
---
There's big difference between fast paced changes and surprise. Blackout introduction was handled as well as it could (at least in my opinion) - info about upcoming changes and general heads up about a week before, then another info with specific timing for the change just before blackout started, but still giving enough time for people to prepare themselves. In case of market tax change, it was very easily skippable - especially for players who don't login every single day and don't follow reddit. Please keep changing the game and iterating on it, just please try not to catch players with upcoming changes by surprise like in this case - it's hard enough to keep yourself prepared for what's going on with all currently existing game mechanics, trying to prepare for every imaginable change to the game at the same time to avoid getting screwed over by sudden random patch notes sounds impossible.
---
You literally have like 15 seconds to panic.
---
&gt; but generally lots of people run missions near Jita as the way back to sell whatever they loot or salvage from their missions is short. 
---
Shhh dont give away our positions. I had someone fly into my deadspace mission when I was in my rattle and he just nopped out.
---
Nice flying dude.

This is dumb
---
Trig ships are the kings of 1v1 and structure bashing. Everything else they are subpar because you aren't going to have time to ramp long enough.
---
&gt;Proceeds from this tax will be used to help fund the Universal Pod Care program for the poorest of New Eden's hisec capsuleers who often experience unexpected and high insurance claims from diseases such as CODE. and PIRAT. 
---
Pretty sure you don't get insurance if killed by Concord.
---
Lol no
---
You know what?
---
We love it!
---
Russian dread runners arent bots, fof peasants, maybe.
---
Is that not an actually true statement though?
---
Look no further than streamers who fly BS and above ships (404HD for example). These guys don't take their BSes down to Delve (asking for a Titan boson on a gate), they take them to Panfam space where they can actually get a decent subcap fight, where they can peel off a few frigates/cruisers before their BS is destroyed.
---
Is it considered a "narrative" if it's just a fact?
---
Sometimes you do dumb shit just to do dumb shit
---
Such a system would be worse than standard blackout.
---
At present, you do not know who is in system.  No one does.  Dotlan jumps give you an idea, so do NPC kills, or ship kills, but you don't \*know\*. (sure, D scan, but its 14.3 AU, and some systems are huge).
---
Now, spies exists.  Yay.  So a "friendly" astero spy flies around, and reports how many blue toons are in each system.  Hell, it's probably something you could illegally bot.  Reported back to hunters, which you still can't see, and those hunters are on top of you much much faster.  
---
At present, you do not know if hunters are coming, but the hunters do not \*know\* you are there.  Arguably, level playing field.  Yeah, help the hunters more because, why, you can't use corp chat, alliance chat, or more importantly won't *make your own custom chat channel*?  (which if you do, A) make it by pocket and B) Don't, spies will find it and use it)
---
I think you're missing my point...
---
No, exactly the opposite. If the change is unknown, there is a time window in which smarter and faster thinking players can take an advantage over slower ones. 
---
With a big headsup, everyone will have adjusted before patch hits.
---
Maybe it has something to do with never actually fighting other groups; only attemtping to gank what you think are defenseless haulers and mining ships. 
---
Or
---
Maybe it has to do with the fact that your members unjronically bragged about pre-massing a hole before an even fight.
---
Agreed. I do wish exploration had a bit more "meat on the bone" to make it a bit more interesting. Signal and/or content variety would be super nice too.
---
The diseases are CODE and PIRAT. The ones getting the insurance are the ones sufferring from them.
---
Will you wear some tight leggins with it? Looking forward to ...
---
Would that happen to be the totally-didn't-happen Tiananmen Square Massacre of 1989 that Winnie the Jinping doesn't want anyone to know about?
---
Only 4 prizes, so literally pointless to enter for the vast majority. Not even a pity prize for Taking your time to boost ccp tweet numbers.
---
But more importantly, it won't produce any good videos anyone wants to watch. The tournaments are super limited participation as well, but at least I get some high level pvp and informative commentary to watch out of it.

this subreddit is one of the nicer subreddits that I've visited.  I had to delete my other account because it got negative karama.  I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to post comments in other subreddits.  bunch of arrogant selfish people.  Like I said in another thread, Eve community is nicer.  Even the game itself is nicer.  Eve Online is one of the good sci-fi games that I've played.  Other games have ugly graphics.  My Gameboy advance games look better.  If I am going to look at the monitor for 1 hour the game better have decent looking graphics.   I'm going to uninstall one the games right now.
---
Don't get me started with the survival games.  The pacing is too slow and I need to craft everything from scratch.  I rather mine ores in Eve Online, compress it and then sell it in a trade hub.
---
Thanks Eve community.  Sorry I haven't been in help chat much but I've I need to monitor local chat for flashing red and yellow icons.  :)

Lowkey CCP should have just outsourced walking in stations and actually made it good
---
&gt;Its not broken. Its working exactly as intended. Nobody is forcing you to interact with cynos, like at all.
---
What? They drop them everywhere. I try to avoid them if anything, but it has only gotten worse.
---
The intention was profit. They added injectors and then tragedy of the commons set in hard and now they refuse to fix the resulting problems.
---
&gt;No I agree, they shouldnt be everywhere. But you dont fix something small by breaking something big. You just fix the small thing. Limit where they can be used, as I said, LS should be able to drop caps everywhere.
---
You just want to protect your zero risk crabbing at this point. Your gameplay is dependent on this imbalance. Thats why you offer no actual explanations as to why this is reasonable.
---
&gt;No way, there are tons of areas filled with people. I have personally fought in plenty more systems than you are describing. But there is an issue with LS. It needs to be fixed so more are there so small gangs can find content.
---
It was a ghost town yesterday, last week, and the weeks before that.
---
&gt;But after Rorqs/injectors that balance got destroyed. There isnt a way back from what. Its 3 years ago, you cant just turn back the time, instead you have to adapt to it and build for the future. 
---
There is a way back, but you are convinced that it is impossible, so nothing should be done. If it stays this way, the game dies a slow death (even CCP is starting to get desperate lately).
---
I’m pretty sure it just happened that a couple fights ended at the same time so the gf level was high.
---
It's the way mining works and has always worked. It's the exact same way in high sec, just replace Rorq with Orca.  You can practically afk and make isk without paying attention to the game. The mistakes they made you can see by just comparing the two ships: Strong tank to prevent ganks in high sec for the orca, strong tank to prevent dying before help comes in nullsec for the rorq. Massive ore cargo so you can just sit in the belt all day without having to drop off ore.
---
Mining drones and excavators were the mistake. Orca and Rorq should be used to boost and haul, not actually mine. Hulks should be the end all be all of mining. It used to be that way and then CCP did what CCP does.
---
Idk what are you talking about
---
So, the last time a mega-coalition was formed, a lot of alliances hopped on the bandwagon. It was great......While it lasted, so after the "victory" they were thrown under the bus so fast it was unreal.
---
Just a month or so after, they were getting farmed and evicted by their so-called "allies". Real classy.
---
Beware of that boys and girls.
---
You should get charged isk for posting :(
---
I could fill a novel with my dumb losses.
---
Uh yes
---
My last Proteus loss I aggro'd a Chinese Hel that had disconnected at his safe. Instead of just leaving I literally sat on him at 0 after our dictors arrived, so he just logged back on and one-shot me. Saw the yellowbox for about 2 seconds before I was in my pod.
---
Killed the Hel tho
---
Atleast im not retarded.
---
The more agency you have in how these work, the less fun they become.  If you don't like gambling, don't use them.  Some people do like it, let them enjoy it.
---
If you want to reap the rewards of someones god tier roll, pay for it.
---
After or before you pinged tdsin to burn in ceptors to handhold you?
---
Fuck this. I'm done with pan fam. Bring friends with the entire map ruins this game.
---
Ok.
---
Sort Dragon kind of backstabbed twice, got accused of backstabbing everyone and all things, after.
---
He's a mediocre FC, that runs out of breath when target-calling, he has admitted questionable judgement and is a proper cunt. 
---
He also don't give a shit what you think about him.
---
Trying to use this pre-school bully technique, against real people, would get you shot or arrested.
---
Stop it.
---
We’re downvoting you because they did make it known. You are perceiving it as they didn’t let you know/they didn’t let you know in the right timeframe but it did happen. I used to work with older people that had trouble understanding changes that we made to systems and it was frustrating for them to get caught up on what was going on, this didn’t change that fact that we had made necessary changes to our systems. They didn’t think these changes were necessary because that was how they perceived things but big picture these changes were necessary. My point is that you’re just perceiving this situation a certain way making your reality different than the actual reality. We got memo, you seemed to have missed it.
---
Which is whos fault exactly, goons for running an efficent operation or  panfam for driving legacy into the goons arms? Look we can stand here all day arguing whos fault is who, at the end of the day this is the way it is. All the whataboutisms in the world aint gonna change it. I don't see any way back from the cliff we're on, lets just enjoy the fall and hope the sudden stop at the end doesn't kill eve.
---
The only reason Serenity happened was because of the laws governing the servers in China made it effectively impossible for CCP to police botting.
---
Stupid losses happen constantly, and I'd argue if they don't you're more than likely an F1 monkey with no desire to do anything besides let someone else play for you, or only in it for dunks so your KB looks dank af yo
---
So does that mean someone will actually show up to fleet battles against goons and test now?
---
No, I see what you're trying to say, but I don't think that's your real point. I think it's simply another "Blackout is bad for all of these reasons we can think to make up that's not really our main point of not having local intel".
---
&gt;Using dotlan, kills are up yes but jumps are way down - -12.9%
---
&gt;
---
&gt;July - 2018:  39,873,724
---
&gt;July - 2019:  34,719,688
---
&gt;Pod kills: also down:  -7.1%
---
&gt;So basically, a smaller group of people got killed more times in July.  
---
The issue here is that you are forming a conclusion based off of assumptions and conjecture.
---
For example, perhaps less jumps have been required (due to the blackout) to find fights in null sec, and thus total jumps are down. 
---
With the visible increase in Gate camps, perhaps more ships have been nullified or cloaked, and are no longer resulting in pod kills.
---
Unfortunately, until you can bring in more context to your figures, they don't mean anything.
---
he's not wrong tho, its a complete fucking mess,still for the best compared to what it was previously but still a complete mess.
---
 I'm not shy about criticising fedup and all but he only brought up the sol stuff as an example of how he found out about it, he's not really whining about it in the video and responses like "oh lmao youre just the bigger blob, just dont blob" etc are missing the point pretty hard.
---
He's USTZ lmao
---
After of course. we had 17 guys when we undocked and thanks to tdsin we were even in numbers.
---
His is a really good idea. The best idea. It’s probably the biggest idea I’ve ever seen.
---
I haven’t done the math recently, but immediately following the most recent yield nerf a rorq could make more money ratting than mining. And of course the fits are much cheaper without excavs.
---
Doesn't mean much coming from an F1 monkey in a nullbloc
---
&gt; flying through Rancer with an industrial
---
upvoted for this, you are the true mvp of the game in my eyes and the hero of my heart.
---
My filthy casual self will attempt to pvp this weekend. I hope to see you nerds out there
---
Bring Democratic Socialism in Eve!
---
Also someone make Bernie/Hilmar fusion memes please.

When I lived in Null back then I always flew through Providence with warp core stab procurers to fuck off people.
---
Who sings that version of for whom the bell tolls? I loved that.

afaik if no other character has corp management skill trained, then you can select from all pilots.
---
Every time we make the universe smaller it turns out to be a terrible idea. this could be the most terrible idea of all the small universe ideas, because it makes individual systems smaller as well as constellations and regions.
---
CCP guys. I have a question about the rules.
---
&gt;Timing ends when the locked NPC is destroyed
---
Does this mean killing something with smartbombs without even locking the target would not be OK for this contest?
---
Dude I got curious and looked at your reddit history. You have a track record of posting on this game and other games about issues that you don’t understand quite commonly. Maybe you should stop and ponder that. Maybe you’re confused... bunch of warframe posts about issues you aren’t happy with.
---
If someone wants so many knives in their back that their mother thinks they're a hedgehog i'll recommend them to ally up with Sort.
---
what happens if you have no isk in a backwater system?
---
Look at his reddit post history....
---
Given what I've seen, it seems more like people want Goons and TAPI to be blued than they do. Diplomatic agreements not to fuck each others sov/structures is not the same as being blue. Goons and TAPI still enjoy plenty of fleet combat against one another.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

Never said he wasn't a human being, never said he was a nice person or that he has to be. I have my personal reasons why I say the things I do, but disregarding my reasons, he's proven to be dead weight and not very helpful to anyone but his bottom line. He's is more than likely to be a problem to others unless you can fill his wallet.
---
First Starcraft II Gold League, now Void Rays are OP in EVE Online.
---
I’m down for some changes too. I’d like to see more orcas mining in null tbh. They fun to kill and sort of even more satisfying than rorquals because they’re more rare. It’s weird... I’m looking forward to when you guys decide that rorquals need some triglavian trickery to effect their panic modules.... *nudge nudge*
---
Was pretty hard to read with the little dots or whatever that is in the background
---
sounds like you'd like belt ratting in lowsec trying to collect security tags and mordus bpcs from the rats.
---
Ard a C in front of CCP and see what they really are.
---
 :)
---
 Comrade Hilmar protects the plebs.
---
Fun and engaging gameplay
---
Please point where on the rorqual CCP touched you
---
I love how my joke post is getting downvoted.
---
Sometimes flairbaiting is fun. Sometimes you get burnt.
---
Supply control? what are you even smoking??
---
Lol what cowards, I am gonna join Goons or TAPI and play EVE in hard mode.
---
*one* time i went into a fight so big there was 10% tidi starting 2 jumps away.
---
Just a bit of feedback.. that font hurts to look at.
---
i got called gay in local and felt sexually aroused what do
---
Back in the day alliances that held sov actually did a lot to pressure people to not sell outside of alliances. Because builders had to be in alliance (corp had to be in sov alliance and in turn you had to be in corp to use the facility) it allowed for more control.
---
cyno jammers exist.
---
t-test doesn't work here, you want a two sample proportions test (or chi square test of Independence, which is equivalent in this case).
---
Tell me how I'm wrong, I'll wait.
---
You're completely ignoring my point and actually talking about the reverse. My issue is that the infromation is hidden *now*, so shortly after the patch. There's nothing "smarter and faster" about returning from holiday/work commitments yesterday and seeing the devblog listed in the launcher, vs returning from holiday/irl commitments today and the launcher making it look like nothing has changed this past week other than the "skill yourself" event.
---
Go belt rat.
---
GOTG are a complete non-entity. 
---
Their botting army numbers must have dropped significantly since the blackout.
---
All that's left of their human membership are goon sycophants waiting for the mittani's dick to show up again over the horizon of cloud ring to give them a sense of direction.
---
The real war has begun, prepare the siege engine upvotes!!
---
PWS needs members, small lowclass wh Corp with a home and a lively crew. Hit me with a pm if you're interested :)
---
yes really - NPCs don't kill pods, they are piloted by players, killed by players, and I'm willing to make the bet 90% of them were in a ship that died right before they met their demise.
---
It's instant, who drinks instant coffee black
---
Guess why I'm not in a corp with silly tax rates either? And those are a different beast than market taxes anyway. My mission/bounty payouts certainly are lower than what I earn selling things on the market. Besides, at least the corp tax usually - in any reasonable corp - funds common corp activities, unlike NPC taxes.
---
Lots of mine happen when I say to myself "I'm just going to go do this ONE last thing before i log off."  That's when something stupid happens. lol
---
a war just ended before summer really kicked off.
---
granted, one side of the war did not actually show up
---
also granted, it got cut short by drifter fuckery
---
either way, a war ended just before summer began, and it looks like with test&lt;3gons happening theres going to be a real war coming in soonish that might actually involve something other than shooting uncontested structures.
---
“Stabilized” anything wormholes completely NULLifies all the mechanics that make wormholes great. Next step after that is stabilized wormholes to wormhole space which is exactly what null blocks want so they can put their caps into any wormhole and evict any group they want.
---
Unlimited mass is bad, week-long connections are bad. The only thing that I’d remotely agree with is potentially a new wormhole wanderer sig that allows something like 6-8 bil in mass with a short 6 hour life or something similar.
---
TLDR: This is a slippery slope and bad mechanic suggestion.
---
I didn't downvote, but i know exactly what you mean. \^^
---
'Hey guys! Please log in and blow up more stuff! Please?'
---
It does almost 1k dps at 40km range or so with 93 dual resists. It s really good for pve.
---
An actually new player making that much would be anything but the norm though (unless he's selling PLEX bought with real money, of course). Heck, despite having a 76mil SP main I make a few billions in a MONTH except when I sell skill injectors.
---
Man the downvotes are coming in hard on the comments against this idea. OP is a bad idea because it removes risk from the game and allows nullblocks to crush people, or to get free logistics (moving your shit)
---
its okay you can cuss on the internet my brother does it sometimes hes cool

Unrollable holes is not a good thing dude.

You can also just resign as corp ceo and it will give you the option to name your successor.
---
People shitting on the dev team when they should be shitting on the marketing team.
---
So you're downvoting me because you ignore what i say and attribute something else to me, gotcha. Talking about different realities is kind of apt i guess.
---
My big issue is that all information about the patch is now hidden. This patch happened less than 48 hours ago. Unless you saw the devblog posted less than a week ago already, the launcher and game currently make it look like nothing happened in the past week other than the "skill yourself" event. 
---
I find that an issue since anyone coming back from holiday or IRL commitments can see the game, notice nothing has changed and then have the rug pulled from under them in days, weeks or months when suddenly they realize a rather notable number changed and the change was hidden quickly so they never found out.
---
Instead, you decide my complaint must be that it was a change on too short a notice, rather than my actual complaint that the change is terribly documented for anyone going forward.
---
Link your KB prove me wrong
---
&gt; I decided to try a little FW and I got blown up quite a bit.
---
When you're first getting started you'll die most of the time especially if your skills aren't quite there yet and that's really frustrating. But that should change once you start to figure out some good fits, the tactics that go with them and have some idea about the fits and tactics of the other guy.
---
Check out the [Novice frigates yearbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12w6WhG1qaWJHwQoxJ5p812mtdctUJhrD/view). It'll *really* help you understand your own ship, the other ships you'll be facing and the fits and tactics you'll want to use.
---
It should be illegal to be this stupid
---
I can see someone staging a Upwell structure to min/max the hell out of it on a 0.9 region. Park the station with the undocking port facing a belt. Have someone kite the belt rats to the belt's beacon point and tank damage. You launch from the upwell, short warp to the belt beacon right on top of the belt rat, target, and pop.  Heck the decoy could possible web the rats since it doesn't actually do any damage. 
---
This contest doesn't seem well thought out.
---
Hisec hauling via courier contract is dirt cheap.
---
Remote indy skills mean never having to undock.
---
Actually skills reach into lowsec and nulsec from Jita.
---
*Now* we're pretty strong. We've had plenty plenty experience with what happens to unaffiliated groups who try to secure sov: they get fucked by *everybody*.
---
There doesn't have to be "a" group - if we did a general reset, even if to a vaguely amicable neutrality with goons, then it wouldn't be a week until a much larger coalition would be forming to fuck us.
---
If Goons, TEST and NCdot all feel that the mechanics and politics of the game require them to be in a larger coalition, then I don't think it's reasonable for an alliance like INIT to make the same calculation. Especially when, 3 years ago, we were about 1/3 the size.
---
That's... not how agency works... agency in games is why we play them and basically makes the entertainment.  The entire premise of eve is free agency.  I'm not saying I don't reap the benefits of mutaplasmids, I just don't gamble with them from my own money.  That said, I think the design is lazy and deserves to be more in-line with spaceships in space that we all play.
---
Everyone has fought everyone, and blued everyone at this point in Eve. What you bitter vets continue to bury your heads in the sand about is, only the current meta matters. 
---
No one cares what happened 10 years ago, when you shit in my front yard yesterday.

man, you have to be nursing some serious contempt to continue to call us that in fuckin 2019
---
Take this fat \*\*\*\* up your \*\*\*\*
---
I know I wouldn't fly 30 gates back in a corm, but I might in a loki.  Not everything or everyone shares your point of view.
---
Most of my losses tend to happen when alcohol is involved, or if I've been roaming for more than 30mins and decide to just take obviously bad fights out of boredom.
---
Slavering!?
---
Must be Amarr..
---
This sounds fun! I'd love to kill NPCs while hoping for blueprint drops, that sounds satisfying..
---
I reset my PI every day and it takes approximately 5 actual minutes. Most of the time spent is logging onto the different characters.
---
With 5 planets per character, you open PI list, double click first planet, double click extractor, stop/start, submit, double click next planet...repeat for each character. Takes about 30 seconds a character while logged in plus the time to relog.
---
It takes more time to fly to a belt and mine than it does to set up my PI for the day. And the two are not mutually exclusive...while your PI is running you can *also* rat/mine/run abyssals, etc.
---
Once every week it takes a bit longer because I get to run an Epithal around on my characters for a few extra minutes and contract to a buyback.
---
Really, there's no reason *not* to do PI. And industry. And research. And reactions. These things all take out-of-game time to complete and you can still do other isk-making activities while they're running.
---
I should point out that I do all of these things with a single omega account and 3 characters. My main active isk activity is abyssals. I also mine and rat when I want a change of pace. But keeping the passive timers running for isk barely dips into those things, and once they're started you're getting both. And they have barely any risk associated with them.
---
Stuff like mining ?
---
you want wormholes
---
I will contact you for more info! thank you that sounds perfect
---
Nah
---
Ah, that is very nice right there... Excited to dig into that!
---
first of all there are npcs that pod you. you can also pretty easily filter npc only kills out of the destroyed ships, op literally wrote about it.
---
also again, people with a brain(sorry if that's not your case) are actually able to warp their pods out before dying most of the time, especially if they have implants, so no, its not reliable at all.
---
I did overheat myabe 1 or 2 of my prop jsut for take fast range for start but the daredevil have a basic speed with 5MN arround 3500-3700+m/s . So its upper than the speed drones
---
It was a good bait :)
---
🥇
---
which industrial should I train?
---
Then yeah, you're missing my point... I feel that it hurts the social aspect of the game.  
---
But sure, if you insist:   Reeeeee no local bad
---
I mean, Test went up against someone before because of what *could* happen. I'm wondering why the same isn't happening now ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
why
---
Join Warp to me incursions
---
My battleship costs 220million and I'm useful to the groups fps
---
If you can do logi  there will always be a space for you to run
---
now this is a good thread.
---
Have a down vote sir...you negative nancy
---
It 'works' like any other half baked idea will work but there are several problems.
---
First is that null ratters rely on sig tanking to defend anyways, and tprpedos do not have good application in the first place.
---
Second, most ratters are drone boats, and drones are a stealth bomber's nightmare since it has no real way of defending itself against them.
---
Third is that industrial ships actually generally have warp strength which is rough on a stealth bomber that usually only has 1 point of disruption.
---
You can sort of work around these problems and even incorporate bombs into your play, but it's not easy. At least it's cheap.
---
I would take care, might be she is actually trayin to figure out HTGAWM U.
---
They already took away headshotting cruisers fleets or larger with the monitor. Why not frigates and destroyers. Its newbee/newbro friendly also.
---
And you have to be pretty retarded to pretend that wasn't the name of the coalition that evicted Test back in 2013. Why should i say the Imperium evicted Test when the Imperium didn't exist back then?
---
Have you considered, I don’t know, reading the fucking patch notes? It’s not a complicated process.
---
Hell, CCP even put out a dev blog, which was also cross posted to this very subreddit which clearly you frequent.
---
What do you want, a personal phone call from Falcon or Hilmar?
---
Fucking spod brained moron.
---
I dunno about all that, it's pretty easy to find content in TEST. It's a strange thing that happens when you don't "glass" an enemy region with 2000 titans, and instead enact a slow-burn war that allows for consistent engagements. At least when Elo Knight is under enough pressure from his line members to actually undock into us, that is.
---
Then there's Volta in Highsec and their content-generation regarding their fake outrage over the TTT. Always a fun fleet to be had there.
---
Let's not forget the constant small gang incursions into Esoteria we get to knock out.
---
In short, as a member of TEST, there's not an hour of the day I can't go out and get some content from somewhere. Or even just wait a small while and get a skirmish or strat op ping. I just about add a page or two to my killboard on the days I find time to play EvE. No one's complaining about lack of content that I've seen, either. Except maybe if your only goal is to get into capital brawls. Those are a bit rarer with an opponent as risk averse as the pandas are.
---
Aww that wasn’t cool
---
Why does my memory go directly to the "Blue Oyster Bar"?
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlGclIZV5JQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlGclIZV5JQ)
---
Mine too fam.
---
&gt;Nah, i read of Goon and Test FCs complaining about lacking content
---
I too read bullshit and assume it is 100% true when it conforms to my narrative.
---
They have always been our pets. But now that we're reaching the final phases of our plans, the masks come off
---
what race industrial should I train?
---
I remember the Fountain War. Remember when we hired PL to come help us defend our staging? Remember when they didn't show. I do.
---
Great idea actually...
---
~6 week old account, so while I have a Praxis that can clear sigs in my C3, I don't have Logi V which I thought was a requirement.
---
Drag local chat into its own separate window from the rest of your chats.
---
Hunt ded’s in a t3 and blow people up doing ded’s in t3’s?
---
This is actually pretty fun, I think I used assfrigs or T3Ds for it, fast and killing the rats isn't trivial (at least with the skills/ships I had), the rewards are ok and you can find small-gang/solo PvP opportunities.
---
Oh, really? As opposed to which one? Cause we outnumber Karmasheet and Brave, we have more content and a greater variety of things newbeans can do and a bloodlust combined with danger ignorance and risk neglect that a Norse berserker would envy.
---
*everytime
---
You do realise that 1AU/s is significantly Faster Than Light right??
---
He should have the warzone on his mind, not everyone joins this game for the safe farm and fields. Fw is such an easy place to dev around since everyone except botters is there for the same reason.
---
Arzad is lit...
---
Truly authentic Arzad experience too with Gian Bal pointlessly shittalking in local while evidently not on grid
---
Wish this kind of stuff could happen in a civilized American timezone...
---
use an overpropped cruiser
---
What if you have no guns?
---
How so? They aren't wanting PvP, they are wanting to pad their killboard so they can call themselves elite.
---
And no, I don't PvE, I have a job so don't need another.
---
I remember PL shooting us (i was in Razor back then) during that war. :)
---
We’re not down here for good fights. And we don’t care about if pgl or vily thinks we’re blobbong [sic]. They’ve talked so much shit about PL and how we aren’t committed to our deploys and how TEST is this battle hardened group. Well we’re here to tell them to nut up or shut up. They’re going to be homeless soon.
---
It's called the punisher
---
I have recently bought an arty loki. This will be my first time using the boat. I have checked top solo kill profiles on zkill and picked one that is not super expensive.(around 900mil)
---
I know that I am going to get popped eventually but before that I wanna score some kills.
---
Any suggestions about picking my targets? What should I engage and what should I avoid?
---
I have come across a ratting ishtar today for example but I chickened out.. :)
---
Thx in advance.
---
As in, if I knew the hole was collapsible and I'd have to gate 30 jumps home, I wouldn't bring anything that I wouldn't mind thunderdoming at the end rather than flying home. If the flux generator made the wormhole reliable, I'd fly something more expensive.
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/character/90708852/](https://zkillboard.com/character/90708852/)
---
Fair enough
---
all tanks holding, the neut wins. Double rep strat will be pressed against a good fit proteus so will have to do the job before caps run out
---
also neuting a prot stops the dps which speeds up the killing and eases up the tanking
---
&gt;We fight and Care4kids  
---
   
---
....
---
Are you trying to use it for Solo? I have the feeling you are. It seems like a good brawler solo but with rails would be a better drone support boat for a small gang. dpsing the larger ships while harassing the smaller ones with its drones.
---
&gt; It's utterly irrelevant since you need to be able to hit small things. You can barely do that with 25 tracking that you get on the pulse harb. 
---
Not too bad at all without tc on base harb if you load faction ammo, although again that is pulses. beams track a bit better then rails but can also be quite effective if you use the 4th mid slot for a tc. Then you can also get the extra range out of them if you need it. Tc give a lot of flexibility. for engagement, I'm surprised it isn't used more. Obviously a bit different with reload times and all but possible.
---
&gt; What? You mean javelin? Good luck hitting anything outside 15km with 150mm rails. 
---
If its over 15km you should be able to hit it. Barring the fast ceptor of course and some specialised kite fit frigs... Otherwise within 15km... Extra Tracking!
---
&gt; I can totally see that to a "beginner" it seems like you may have a lot of viable options. However, this is simply not the case. The margin between winning and losing is in same cases non-existent. Anything that deviates from "basically optimal for the intended purpose" means you die. 
---
"beginner", I can also gloat about playing for about 10 years. I also like fitting and enjoy fighting in unconventional ships and fits. This isn't new to me. The margin of winning and losing is very tight, that's the fun. If you are in small gang then you have a few hopefully experienced team mates to lean on when you ship is not capable enough to counter everything... Which it never will. For solo, you will lose, that's EvE, that's life, that's the reality of playing dice. But with a ship built to what you are good at, solo can be very powerful. naturally don't take fights you can't win... And I honestly don't know a lot of solo pvpers that use brawl, Like they will but only when they need to.
---
&gt; The bonus doesn't matter if the RESULT is simply inadequate, and it is just that on the VNI. It would need a 100% bonus to be seen as "bad". You need to be able to project 3-400 dps to 20-25km to be able to not auto-die to 2-3 afs. If you cant do this, that ship will not be considered. 
---
3+ afs is a tricky spot anyway. I don't know of a single cruiser (I prefer Amarr, lasers provide really nice flexibility,  and I can't think of a single ship that would do it well... maybe a Tanky Maller with focused pulses, or a Arbitrator with neuts.) that could reliably take them out since their buffs. I would also argue that's their intended purpose. To swarm and overwhelm much larger opponents. And if they are ab Vengeances... well your drones wont live moments outside the bay and you wont be alive much longer. Vengeance is a fun ship. Ab for Low sig, fuck up any drones or frigs with rockets in seconds, possibly a plate for a bit of extra buffer. Good times with a few buds.
---
Now I'm off topic. The ship can't do everything. None of them ever will. If one can, EvE has gone down a dark road and they seem to try and fix ships that get close to balance it out. Fit to its strengths and try to fight to its strengths. That's a summary of 6 years of small gang null and wh PVP. If the ship is inadequate for taking on AFs, then avoid them. If you get caught, Know how to best deal with them and have the right ammo types in case. This isn't rocket surgery. Just like how cap guns will never track a drone. I have always seen EvE as a game of using the right ship for the job, then out fitting, out positioning, and over estimating your opponent. That's why there are... how many hundreds of ships now? 
---
Either  way, the VNI changes have mainly improved it. The per skill changes didn't get a single downside. They even increased drone tracking on top of new rep and gun bonuses. an extra turret hard point, more PWG and CPU, lower sig radius. They did take away the bandwidth to prevent full heavy flights which... 2-3 AFs would have ended pretty quick. and well... mobility slightly slower, slightly more agile, huge drop in mass, and slower align time. The only significant nerf here is the bandwidth which wont help you much with the AFs you mentioned so...
---
Only they have you set neutral permanently now. I would be interested to know that isn't the case.
---
There is a big difference between being Coalition allies and fuckbuddies. Init is literally trying to play both sides. They need to decide where their loyalties lie.

And now in 2019, after 2 years of substantially reversing those changes, we're right back to the situation we had that drove the Phoebe power projection event, and for largely similar reasons. Although I will readily concede that there are other factors, like the massive buffs that caps received in 2017 and the huge buffs to mineral output from Rorquals - but those work right alongside the relaxation of power projection.

EVE has always been weird.  I rather suspect that "forbidden" isn't quite the right term.  We've been busy with another project,

It's in nullsec, not WH. A null&gt;null hole that lasts a few days would basically be a temporary regional gate that doesn't let caps through. It allows two groups connected through the hole to brawl each other for a few days until the hole collapses.
---
If the hole generated a connection into say, drones, people can use the temporary hole to hunt bots out of it while staging in their home system.

The goons attacked PanFam not because of "strategic objectives" to gain anything, they did it to create content. Besides creating content, there's simply no reason to attack someone. And even then, uncontested structure bashes are barely content.
---
What happened in the north happened because PanFam had 0 incentive to defend their structures. Why risk their supers and Titans when they can just relocate and lose a few citadels. Without asset safety, they would have had to stay and fight while moving out. There would've have been a conflict instead of basically 0 fights.
---
And believe me, asset safety helped a ton with the move. They simply asset safetied assets to the same lowsec station, which helped logistics a lot since they could do back and forth moves from the same 2 stations in low and null. I don't want to minimize what they did, but it would've been massively more difficult without asset safety.
---
Asset safety is present in all Upwell Structures, which includes those Engineering Complexes, so that's why they're not getting destroyed. Only current structure that drops loot (outside of jspace) are POSes, which are almost never used.
---
If NS wars are created to serve a strategic purpose... What was the goons' purpose in attacking PanFam? There is none, it was created to try to generate content, which then failed because PanFam has no reasons to defend.
---
There's no more "small guy" in null, that is simply a myth. Any smaller entity currently active in null is active because it's allied with a much bigger one that would come and defend it, or it's part of a bigger coalition. Plus some asset safety suggestions target specifically vets, who own billions in assets, not the "poor small newbro".
---
Additionally, if you're in null, you're supposed to be in the most dangerous area of kspace, not in a kiddie pool, it's supposed to be dangerous and risky. If you lose all of your shit, then you risked it. HTFU and adapt.
---
I keep it handy in another window while roaming around solo. Helps me figure out which fights I want to take and how I might want to change my tactics. 
---
If you're just getting started out with PvP I'd suggest going with one of the T1 or empire faction ships that he ranks as borderline overpowered or a high 1v1 kill %. Your character's skills likely have some gaps and you're still learning it yourself so you'll want to maximize your chances.
---
I'm partial to the Tristan myself because it's a jack of all trades that's actually pretty good at most of them. Makes it hard for the other guy to counter you if he doesn't know if you're a kiter at 20km off the button, a high DPS brawler or a neut fit right on the button or a scram kiter half-way in between.

Not everyone playing eve online is following this subreddit. I was well aware of the incoming changes; this entire topic is explicitly not about me even though people such as yourself are making it out as that, down to now someone literally going through my reddit history.
---
Here's the simple facts, repeated from my OP:
---
* there's a devblog, but it was unclear on date.
---
* patch notes were hard to find, are apparently under the wrong month.
---
* there's no message coinciding with the patch happening in the launcher.
---
* the previous link to the devblog has been removed from the launcher.
---
* it's a holiday season + people have IRL commitments that mean they can't necessarily be glued to eve/reddit the whole time.
---
So anyone who comes back from a week of holiday or being busy IRL, tomorrow, or in a few days? Do you really think they'll still see the "cross posted dev blog" on reddit then? Or the direct link to it that was previously in the launcher, removed now? Or do you expect people to read the full patch notes, every time they open the launcher, even if there's nothing to hint a patch changed anything? Is such news not kind of the point of having a launcher in the first place?
---
&gt;What do you want
---
What i want is actually really simple actually: for the launcher, which shows *game news* to show the *game news* that a patch happened recently, and perhaps to link to the information of it.
---
Not for me. I already have this information. But unlike some people, i can understand how some people might be away from the game for periods of a week or so and not expect notable changes in the game without any indication of it after the fact.
---
I wouldn't like it if i went away and came back in two weeks, seemingly nothing changed but then i undock and lose my ship somewhere because my module's resists were lowered and of course i didn't doublecheck that before undocking, why would i. When established mechanics change, it's not a simple bugfix patch and it deserves notifying the players said patch happened and keep it around a while so players are aware.
---
The fact that *so* many people are against this basic concept just boggles my mind.
---
Considering how long they take to ramp up I don't even know how they survive long enough to do meaningful damage in a 1v1.
---
How about making this sub password only to avoid these epic suggestions?
---
Good video, terrible music.
---
If you just want to get a grasp on the game overall I’d go with eve uni. If you want to dive into the deep end I’d join Karmafleet.
---
Rollsale are generally held in distain by Wh'ers for that reason.
---
Not sure how you would scale it or if you even intended to want that. It be a pain in the rear side unless you make it like Ruc 'road user charges  for diesel vehicles/trucks and you pay for 'blah* jumps in advance. Auto pilot is an option but how would that work if there was 'gate tax'. I still have the issue not fair on newer players, there is so much for them to learn already and you want them to pay just to explore.
---
That is one thing I have noticed and did the math to kill example a merm with the Caldari bomber will do about 5k damage will so about 3k dmg a salvo. 
---
A merm has 12k armor and hull. A bomb and three salvos to kill it. I am not sure if that is realistic to think you can kill before they switch to you.
---
If u don't play u can always drop titan to corporation assets or sell it?
---
They already punished people that don't play with removing Station's in sov system? Did it change anything?

This is triggering me right now. I spent all night last night fighting stubborn DP violations on C4 so I could get my chip to pass GF's DFM by 9 AM this morning. I ended up just deleting entire nets and telling the PnR engine to re-route away from C4.

---
It's sabaton
---
But still you air your grievances, by simply calling him a backstabber?
---
He killed my Broadsword with a titan, in a FFA. He ran out of breath in a killing-spree. He has short hands and will short-change you on any deal, no matter how small. Just a cunt.
---
His position is undisputable, only the metagaming is causing him to be a target for your bile, in this thread.
---
I'm not contesting PI can be brief with the right setups. I'm just against the idea anything in EVE is truly *free*, you're always paying for it in some way. Even if that is 5 actual minutes every day, you're paying for it in that time plus the inconvenience of "having to". Major or minor, it is what leads to the ISK gains so they're no more free than minerals you mine.
---
**This is a Feature**, eve working as intended. No cause for alarm
---
local is fucked, don't rely on the names you see. As far as I can tell the names in local transfer over to the next system you jump into.
---
Yeah and then it turns out all those sick kids in the dronelands were just russuan renters, botters, and RMTers.
---
why not just max tank a harpy ?
---
It’s not, though. New player isn’t going to bail on Eve because the caracal fit in the trailer isn’t great or their drone pattern is dumb. Fuck.
---
I haven't the least idea. Weren't there a couple of alliances that were trying that, I vaguely recall from one of JinTaan's nullsec summaries?
---
At least they had that much foresight.  If they hadn't made Horde, Brave would probably be in their place right now.
---
I have also gained the ability to chat with people in other systems!
---
I think that simply means the current implementation of Incursions are not hard enough or risky enough. But my point was that more challenging PVE would bring less bots --- and I think there are not a whole lot of incursion bots?
---
I mean, Radmere chimes in and gives an example of just how his point is accurate and how the defender mechanics allow fuckery to happen and that it is in fact counterintuitive, or am I the only one who just listened to the words being spoken?
---
Finally someone who is not blinded by tribal colours.

---
literally his own worst enemy is himself
---
&gt; or are the chat servers just fucked again 
---
They are fucked *still*. They've been shitting themselves regularly for a while now.
---
One of my alliance mates likes to promote the theory that the blackout was actually just a front to take some of the pressure of the chat servers while they attempt to fix them. I'm starting to think he may have a point.
---
It might be an accident but lets hope they do the "its not a bug its a feature" thing here
---
&gt; Darkness. Is the best allies anyone could hope for.
---
Is this satire.

That awkward moment when some guy running sites looks up and realizes there's 30 other people in system (probably all cloaked in a proteus).
---
&gt;Are you trying to use it for Solo? I have the feeling you are. It seems like a good brawler solo but with rails would be a better drone support boat for a small gang. dpsing the larger ships while harassing the smaller ones with its drones.
---
Wouldnt use it in a fleet either. The damage projection is broken since you cant apply, and you cant brawl since you get dropped on.
---
&gt;Tc give a lot of flexibility. for engagement, I'm surprised it isn't used more.
---
Because it gimps the ship.
---
&gt;"beginner", I can also gloat about playing for about 10 years.
---
You simply do not speak as someone who has been playing for that long. Maybe you have been doing industry.
---
&gt;If you are in small gang then you have a few hopefully experienced team mates to lean on when you ship is not capable enough to counter everything..
---
Why would I pick a bad ship? It doesnt even synergize with itself now. Split weapons was established as being bad years ago.
---
&gt;Either way, the VNI changes have mainly improved it. The per skill changes didn't get a single downside. They even increased drone tracking on top of new rep and gun bonuses. an extra turret hard point, more PWG and CPU, lower sig radius. 
---
It's worse in every way. No point in using it. The dps is shit. It is actually embarrassing how bad it is. And all of this because they couldnt detect bots running for 24/7 for 8 months. Staggering incompetence.
---
Ahhhh the old ace up the sleeve of ccp’s
---
I met some of your duders there recently who told me you're anchoring a Keep so i thought you were moving in lol.
---
Does it mean, that bots can get info about who's in local from the client?
---
Some people mean it sincerely too. 
---
If I was important, notable, or otherwise cared about I would say that ***I*** always mean it sincerely, because I do. Even if the fight actually sucked, it sucked because I/we got outplayed, out numbered, or someone brought the hard counter to your ship/fleet, and I'd say GF. Any fight is a good fight, it just might have started long before the first point hit or the first shot was fired.
---
But I'd get a resounding "who?" in that case. So uhhhhh... oh shit, I played myself. 
---
This is where 90% of the people are risk averse PVP. 10% will stay on grid and be true elite PvP trying to kill  as much reinforcments as they can and then  bail out.
---
90% of PVPer's thinks its all about fighting 10vs1 ratter.
---
&gt; PL founds Horde to be their newbie pets. Fast forward a couple years and Horde is running the show
---
Almost as if Horde was made to accept literally everyone, in comparison to PL. Just like Karmafleet does the same exact thing, allowing them to grow in size. How did that come as a surprise?
---
In what way I wonder? I've been in both Horde and Karmafleet. GSF forums are so shitty for a new player in comparison to the way Horde greets and display content to new players oof.
---
I have 387 losses, all except one would have been avoidable (introduction mission that kills you in order to teach you the permaloss mechanic), but would also have made my eve life very boring had I attempted to do so.
---
Their sig and defensive capabilities can keep them along pretty well, but it requires bling. People tend to bling precursors because the hull cost makes it feel not as bad.
---
Honestly it matters very little in the end. If you're open to everyone like all the big coalitions are you're basically opening the door to spies and whatever else. It just takes a little longer to get into the other ones.
---
It's a bug. It's enabled in WHs now too.

well, have fun shooting 529274719 goon structures then.

Couldn't agree more really. Learning from failure is an important mechanic from which humans gain new knowledge. If you never challenge yourself you'll stay in place and eventually be overtaken by others that did things, failed at them and became better for it. Literally applies to 100% of human endeavors.

ISK for me. I've been playing on and off for about 13 years. Only charged to credit card once (returning after Omega/Alpha split and reorganization). HALF of my estimated space-riches have been pissed away by being dumb, inebriated, tired, or a combo of those.
---
I love that everything is more or less traceable and time-stamped in this game. Even if you're blacked tf out you can still tell everyone on discord about the dumb shit you don't recall doing.
---
It went like this for me: 
---
Login whenever after last session was played drunk or stoned (now just the ganj since I don't drink/drug anymore)... Oh wow a shopping spree went off huh!? What is all this shit, why do I need it, and why the fuck was I price-consciously buying like eight jumps from where I docked? Geckos!? I don't use Geckos. Did a corpie want me to get them some? Why the fuck do I have *three* Obelisk freighters now? I'm an indy guy now!? These jobs in running are all losers! Why are all of my beautiful isk-machine planets redone, and why are they spread across a random WH/HS home/NPC Null system assortment!?
---
KM loss, KM loss, frig newbro kill (chat log shows I am an asshole), KM loss, KM loss... And so on.
---
Also whenever I meet a newbro and they discord or gamechat me for longer than 10 mins I drop ISK on them.
---
This game is going to get very expensive for me now that I'm accessing mostly paid game content... I'm not a skilled teen gamer anymore, I'm a lazy adult with credit cards and bigger paycheques. Shit.

I feel no shame in admitting that this is why I went Amarr when my fellow noob friends were all flying Caldari.

Alright, no question is too stupid eh... Here goes:  
---
I started playing eve online about 2 or so weeks ago, to replace another game i put up with (War Thunder) and yeah i know this is an old game but it still looked like good fun. Then, i see all the commotion around the various current and upcoming changes all with this "new era of chaos being heralded by ccp on the tis podcast and elsewhere" and in general hear both a lot of good and praise but also A LOT of negative and salty buzz, especially on forums and reddit, none of which affect me in any serious way so far, now... What IS the state of the game, is it healthy enough and worth putting my time and effort in and maybe in deu time perhaps also money to plex my character?  
---
I am having fun so far flying my dessie and cruiser and that is just doing some simple pve stuff in high/low sec with the occasional triglavian shenanigans i come across with other random folks, some mining and trading as well, suppose I'm what some people call a crab(?), but seeing I'm having fun, as such i am perfectly content with my alpha newbro character as things are, but seeing the buzz i am finding it difficult to grasp the health of the game and the direction it is heading in. I want to like it and seeing my current experiences so far i am probably going to want to enjoy it for years to come so... Yeah.... Rain your thoughts on me so i can try to form a better opinion on things please...
---
[https://i.imgur.com/ltBmT6b.png](https://i.imgur.com/ltBmT6b.png) but there is local chat in 0.0 now. lol.

It would take several tries, but just use a ceptor with arty, and load the mids with sebos. Use an alt to get it into low low structure and have it hard tackled.

Is your big null bear alliance chat not friendly?

Pretty accurate afaik.

Hey a poor guys gotta start somewhere
---
I had to contact my ISP because my Ethernet had stopped working and only wifi was up. They ended up upgrading our router and it started working again. It was Spectrum, same as another commenter who was having issues, so it was probably an error on their end.
---
Sure, however many years ago perhaps. I'm talking about right now, in 2019.
---
Almost every pvper/solo roamer knows that if you want the best fights, without risk of getting dropped by caps, head to Horde space. You might not **like** that that's the case, but those are just facts dude.
---
And it's not surprising either. Goons/Delve position themselves as "the place to live" if you want the dankest ticks and the best protection, so it's no wonder they do everything they can to keep hunters/pvpers from wanting to roam there. I would argue that their "defensive stance" is much more "anti-content" than Horde's as a result though.
---
Gotta love Chewwy.
---
I think it was more cause of the raitaru name on scam....
---
Local is not back, everything is still FUBAR. Alliance chat is gone, fleet chat is gone, "local" is switching between all different channels (at one point I even had 50 odd people in "loca"l). Relogging doesn't do anything.
---
Worry not though! This is blackout! It's not a bug, it's a feature!

Where's the part you talk about cynos and bridges?
---
no fuck off
---
No to this and to removing asset safety.  It should stay.
---
Have some random messages undelivered. Meh, seems like it's not friday night EVE time.
---
This I can actually get behind.
---
i keep my body pure for jeffm8r and garth tecklin
---
no one need local or chat
---
install grindr. if you need help I can walk you through it.
---
No tengu either grrr
---
Honestly i kind of am Agitated, but not for a reason that directly has anything to do with me. I made this post to call out the fact CCP made a noteworthy mechanical change and has now hidden any mention of it from player's first glance. Normally changes like this have a clear update mention in the launcher, linking to patch notes or more information (news posts). Lacking this is a setup to basically cheat people in the game that happened to not have played this last week; they knew a rule of the game itself as X, that rule got changed, they didn't get a proper chance to actually know about it simply because they dared to not be active in eve or reddit for one week.
---
Meanwhile, me pointing out this issue has led to people going off topic and declaring the taxes good (i specifically stated this topic is NOT about the actual changes, just the communication), constantly spouting "change is good" while ignoring the actual topic, etc. etc.
---
Even falcon decided it was just players going "REEEE", ignoring the point people may be caught off guard by a number swap affecting them that they never had a proper chance to be aware of.
---
To answer your statement about "every trader" though; i kind of disagree, i'm "only" a manufacturer but i didn't notice the change had gone live that day (after selling some things) until someone else mentioned it in a channel. A change like this simply isn't easily noticed. For people unlike me who didn't see the original devblog 5 days prior, it'd be completely out of the blue, nothing shown in the game or launcher. They might not notice for days, weeks or more.
---
I don't feel "sad" about anything regarding the changes. I just feel kind of annoyed that devs and players alike seem to be jumping on having to follow eve's new religiously at all times or else have seemingly set in stone rules changed from under you without any real way of knowing. Eve is commonly tongue-in-cheek labeled a second job, but i really don't feel that should be an actual requirement. The blackout was short notice, but that actually *had* information in the launcher telling what was happening and more might come. Such mentions of recent changes is now a thing of the past, apparently.
---
Nice! Did you win the contest? Exactly.
---
If you reinforce people's structures of course they're going to ask their friends to help them avoid being evicted. If you want gfs try engaging ships instead of structures.
---
Yes I'm biased against sort, shocking.
---
Just make 50% of assets drop and be done with it
---
Something something, Harpy? Right now it's the closest thing thing to frig sized Monitor.
---
Right. Now it's about getting dropped on. I could suggest a Newry drone boat but you would complain about cap problems and a cap battery would gimp it. I could suggest vamps but you would say it's not viable for a long term fight against a missile boat. I could suggest using one of the two weapon types since they both get great bonuses but you would complain you would rather try to fit rails on the drone boat instead of using it as a drone boat like many others. I suggest tracking fixes to fix your kite issue and you complain about application to brawlers. I suggest brawlers and you complain about kiters and droppers. I mean shit. At this point I wouldn't be surprised if I suggested remote repair and you complained about having no friends to repair.
---
Do you know of a single ship that can tick 90% of those boxes let alone all of them?
---
in the era of zero information policy of ccp, i would say this is intended
---
&gt;hope the sudden stop at the end doesn't kill eve.
---
It never has before and it wont now.
---
Are we? Seems like there's always a keepstar going up somewhere.
---
Just farm for escalations you can make a ton of money it’s safe and kind of relaxing. Just make sure you look up the ded site you are going into some of them can be tough. I like farming refuges in Sansha space cause they are fast and about 1-10 has a faction spawn
---
No probes
---
The ability to recognize when a death is "absolutely avoidable, extremely dumb, idiotic fail" is probably the most critical skill to develop when learning this game. Now I kind of want to make a spreadsheet for death types.
---
I mean, yeah, some balance is hard, but a weapons system with higher damage, better range *and* better tracking than others of the same class is pretty clearly unbalanced.
---
Without probes
---
It's worse than just that
---
I mean, you can't say never. Hilmar was pretty adamant about a change needing to happen, and that NPC stations should not be places to store tons of things.
---
This is good progress.
---
&gt;*Is it back or are the chat servers just fucked again?*
---
Well first we need to define our terms...
---
If I had a larger source of income I'd definitely solo more.  As it is, I build most of my wealth by being cheap af.
---
Because fuck ratting and mining.
---
What about wormhole space people they have real life's too
---
If only you have seen BSG and had any clue what I am referring to.
---
it was a joke
---
This is the result of the last month of them trying to fix the bug they called Blackout.  Try again, CCP, you're drunk.
---
High value combat sites?
---
It's all relative. Solo in some cheaper ships! There's tons to learn even in 15m ships that you can just throw away by the dozen. Some PvP can be fairly profitable at the higher end, killing DED runners, wormhole ratters, ect. But yes fuck ratting and mining.
---
I couldn't tell, I've seen worse sensible ideas here.
---
gone again
---
The difference there is we know the second it’s moved into a wormhole it’s already lost, hence we keep valuables out of the hole.
---
Cloud chat is still working fine guys, nothing to see here, they fixed it months ago!
---
:thinking:
---
Maybe it’s better for you that you’re still questioning that.
---
As a 100% single boxer who just wants to fund pvp, your highest isk/hr is probably to be supercarrier ratting or rorqual mining. If you're new, exploration or incursions could be a good idea. Stuff like industry is doable but typically requires lots of alts and lots of money in order to scale up to the point where it'd be better than just grinding isk out in space. You could also look into PI, as it's mostly passive, but there's not much isk in it, and even less if you're in highsec. It's also a lot of clicking and intense autism, but can be comfy if (like me) you're into that kind of thing.
---
Chat has been varying degrees of broken for well over a year now.  Its just not as bad anymore so its usually not noticeable unless you're looking for it.  Still has at least one clusterfuck every few days.
---
no lore announcement so im calling it a bug
---
I dont think titans dropping from keepstars is a good idea but then again i dont think letting them dock in the first place was a good idea.
---
trash talking and being in gotg, lolol
---
Lol keepvaluables out of the hole get the fuck out
---
Hey I've seen this one before!
---
It's shittalk not trashtalk... know the difference
---
Actually more true than the assertion that using the 64 Bit client means something other than "maybe it will suck less if I get in a big fight."
---
Because Hilmar has been an idiot for 10+ years, and now he's getting more active in EVE development.  You do the math.
---
Hilmar did say this was going to be a time of chaos. So... Op success?
---
Ok Thanks :)
---
Don’t worry it’s glitched, your wormhole site bot is safe
---
Almost every 'big' wormhole pvp corp will fight based on diplomacy...  If you say 'weve got 4 dudes, 4v4 cruisers no logi?' they will say 'yeah!', take the fight then say good day
---
I do it too tbh
---
nerf ccp
---
Man, if only you were around for pre-coup brave.  It was flaming garbage that worked.
---
 "  uhhh... triglavian bull shit lore reason... mkay"  
---
can't afford servers  
---
can't afford competent staff  
---
have hilmar  
---
have falcon  
---
need a toe cutter
---
Interesting idea for sure. Upventured
---
&gt; We’re not down here for good fights. And we don’t care about if pgl or vily thinks we’re blobbong [sic]. They’ve talked so much shit about PL and how we aren’t committed to our deploys and how TEST is this battle hardened group. Well we’re here to tell them to nut up or shut up. They’re going to be homeless soon.
---
This doomchinchilla copypasta never gets old.
---
Nah your just overthinking shit
---
Void Ray is too shit in SC2 atm, Koreans call it like “giggle ray” cuz they lol when enemy builds it.
---
Now you can see kiki’s future if CCP decides to nerf kiki.
---
im too depressed to play eve but i hope everybody has a fun and safe weekend and feels better than i have
---
Shit did the contest end? Exactly.
---
hey people still using pos's
---
New feature. WHers will have to deploy a structure to mask it.
---
\#MeTuefel movement?
---
In Gold League, anything is viable
---
My "net value" is roughly 45 billion. And I've made probably close to 10 billion of that with skill injectors. It's hard to say how much I've played actively, but march 2006 to mid-2008 was quite active, then mostly not much until 2013 when I played for maybe a couple of months messing around in FW and incursions, and then a break until now the last couple of months.
---
Currently my best non-lobotomy ISK source is Trig invasions, which are fairly nice money in a good group, but I can't imagine making billions in days on a new character even with my experience. FW would yield decent income I suppose that doesn't require lots of SP - a lot of my FW income in 2013 was with low-SP chars since my main needed to not be in FW to do incursions for periods of time. But that's about it. I'm sure some new players can get rich really fast, but really, that's the outlier, not the norm.
---
LOL, CCP can't ever get anything working properly the first....second....hell, fourth time.  You really think they'd successfully implement weighted random like this?  
---
Hell, this very event has been broken for a lot of people, stuck on "Allocating skill points" for a week, preventing said players from getting any subsequent rewards.  These players were fucked by RNG even if they do have this algorithm.  Yes, if you put in a ticket they eventually fix it, and give you ONE day's worth of compensation.  I had an alt stuck for 6 days before they got to the ticket, and it got a whopping 10k SP as "compensation" for missing minimum 60k.  Sure hope his version of the bell curve didn't have 50ks in those missed days.
---
My personal intel, enjoy and thank you CCP ♥
---
Pretty bad mental hygiene, if you let that cunt, affect you that much.
---
Lol Well that’s the truth, not my fault you are too blockheaded to believe it. Anyone with any sort of sense keeps BPOs, skins, injectors and the such out of the hole.
---
Income tax is thief
---
No, dont do this.  It's a bad idea.
---
Are you sure its from HKA , and not from Royal Group from Tenal?
---
Pacifier fam.
---
FUck that. Keep the blackout.
---
&gt;Now it's about getting dropped on.
---
More like its gotten progressively worse in the last year or so. Redesigning a ship to only function as brawler at this time is unbelievably stupid.
---
&gt;Do you know of a single ship that can tick 90% of those boxes let alone all of them?
---
No, and the new VNI is still badly designed and effectively unusable.
---
I just need to find better solo patterns.  Trying to kill VNIs in a retribution didn't go too well for me.
---
Idk, but there was no reason for them to make it up, but you're right with all the keeps going up assuming a move was propably a bit too fast.
---
Near perfect skills is a requirement for logi, but for dps rolls all you need is a battleship that gets 70% shield resists and around 100kEHP before fleet boosts.
---
They have fits on their website and in game channels linking cheap fits that do that (~200mil)
---
That's a pretty funny bug.
---
Hahaha yeah there's a few ways. I know there's a handful of VNI clubbing Wolf fits out there for use down in Delve. They're pretty fun to fly, check out the Suitonia via!
---
I played until April 2015 and was part of CFC/Imperium (shoutout to any European Goonion who reads this - best time of my life).
---
Can anybody give me a quick rundown what happened afterwards (I know about WWB a little bit and goons live in Delve now).
---
Considerung a comeback to EVE, because of local chat changes and curiosity - I try to figure out what happened the last \~4years and whats going on.
---
Any info is appreciated!
---
keep local delete u/Novemb3r_
---
&gt;Sure, however many years ago perhaps. I'm talking about right now, in 2019.
---
Spent literal years choking out the little guy, cries after less than 6 months for almost 2 years now about how it sucks they're not the one choking out the little guy anymore.
---
All of a sudden its a problem, just panfam things. ¯\\(ツ)/¯
---
Yeah,  let's just make a frigate that has a million EHP, can fit a combat probe launcher, has tons of mid slots for any utility you can think of, and can fit a MJD that can't be shut off to GTFO whenever you need to.   /s
---
Headshotting an FC is a valid tactic to throw an opposing force in to disarray.  I think it's bullshit they took a lot of that away by releasing the Monitor. If your group can't function after the loss of a single person then you shouldn't win. This just makes it easier to have hordes of mindless F1 monkeys with only one person that needs to have any idea of what the fuck is going on. It caters to the N+1 meta and creates a space where nobody has to learn anything about tactics as long as they have one person that does.
---
Have to change the interval setting from one to immediate. I think it's in the first settings tab.
---
Not their leadership that's for sure.
---
That's some big oof right thar. Imagine being a 16 year old game where you can't even engineer basic fucking text chat properly.
---
I wonder if they did the null blackout to cover for the chat system fuck ups?
---
I figure something like a Hecate would completely wreck a Kikimora and cost far less. A basic T2 fitted Hecate can put out over 650dps in sharpshooter mode with my skills. I don't see the Kikimora surviving that long enough to do enough damage back very easily. If it's indeed a blaster Hecate I guess outranging with a good webifier might work in some cases, but then a rail Hecate does decent damage as well.
---
So overall I just can't seem to find any reason to fly these precursor ships due to their weaponry and cost.
---
Fuck off you salty nullkrab
---
So we can roast them over the coals about how pathetic they are that they can't make a stable chat system after a decade and a half?
---
They exist, they're called Assault Frigates.
---
I'd rather shoot myself in the head than rorq mine for hours a day
---
&gt;feature
---
if INIT are anchoring a keep in Tribute, it's news to me. Now you bring the topic up, I believe goons anchored a couple in Pure Blind?
---
I personally don’t 1v1 with one due to cost. Their cost in general makes them very prohibitive for what you can do with them. However they are fun to fly.
---
Fucking yikes. What a hamfisted dissaster. This is the code that goes into making this game. No wonder the "logs don't show anything" ever.
---
This guy neuts.
---
&gt; Panfam/WinCo would likely welcome TAPI as an ally in WWBee 2.
---
I'll take "Things that will never fucking happen" for 500, Alex. In aggregate, there's way more Panfam hate than there is grrr gon.
---
Hecates win unless kited well (Which is hard with the webs)
---
I think he was more saying "everyone who's been living in a wormhole longer than 2 weeks has way more assets in their home hole than could conceivably be saved in event of eviction", and in my experience that's 100% true.
---
nobody even cares where you are lmao
---
Any recommendations for my first battlecruiser? I can't make up my mind so i keep delaying. I've been doing exploring in wormholes as my source of income just hacking unguarded sites. Im starting to play with the idea of trying to explore a wormhole  and then come back with a battlecruiser and do the combat sites. Other goals would be l3 missions solo and some trig content with small groups. 
---
I started as caldari but have trained a little bit of everything except amarr and energy weapons. I'm kind of looking for advice on which way to take my skill training as much as which particular ship to fly. Goal being higher end pve content that i can solo but also something i can bring to small groups and contribute.
---
Getting invaded for buying the north time kinda sours the relationship a bit.
---
Then you'd complain about there being no good farmholes lol
---
Hardly overpowered just don’t try and yolo frigs into it lol
---
Yeah you're right, EVE players min-maxing and taking things to autism levels of efficiency? Nah, that would NEVER happen.
---
&gt;Particularly for new players seeking to become traders, OR even for smaller established players, that &lt;1.5% is significant.
---
If this was true, they'd already be using the 10% markup they can get by servicing the less-populated trade hubs.
---
They aren't.
---
They'd be servicing the \~50% markup they could get by servicing their alliance's staging in null.
---
&lt;1.5% is not going to motivate anyone when orders-of-magnitude larger differences do not motivate anyone.
---
&gt;Jita didn't become that way overnight
---
Actually, it pretty much did.  When they got rid of the "highways" that made Yulai the trade hub, most trade moved to Jita pretty quickly.  Because it had lots of good, high-quality agents nearby (when agent quality was a thing) and lots of stations providing lots of slots for manufacturing (when station manufacturing slots were a thing), in the space that was "home" to most of the players (back when race mattered and Caldari had big advantages).
---
The other hubs had some of those advantages, but didn't have the station count of Jita nor the race advantage, so they didn't get as much players in the area, and thus not as much trade.
---
&gt;You only need a the smallest of hints to suggest other hubs are genuinely seeing resurgence
---
\[Citation Required\]
---
Not sure where you got to that conclusion, but there a difference between screeching or reeeee'ing over someone and being biased against a certain person for their previous actions. At most in my case is, "Sort? Of fuck that twat! That wank stain can bugger off since screwed me mate over." 
---
Pretty sure that's not at the level of derangement or anything similar to it.
---
I also had a guy drop a super capital on my dominix and say "I win Faggot!" So....yeah.
---
w0ws0c00l
---
Its not a bug, Its a feature.
---
What we really would need is one half way decent programmer in iceland !
---
CCP apparently is grossly incompetent, they can  EITHER read OR try to fix core functions in a game, like a chat for example ... so better do not make them read anything.
---
Not quite what I had in mind, bugs do happen sometimes y'know!
---
Not gonna say good fight back like some kinda noob! 
---
"GET WRECKED BADDIE!"
---
outblobbled != outsmarted
---
Try a VPN?
---
4 leshaks, dictor, focused void bombing bomber
---
Yea, No other t1 destroyer comes close to the Kiki. Absolutely absurd that they thought it was okay to put out that iteration.
---
&gt; I thought it would be good to have a *fourth thread* going about it!
---
ftfy
---
wow this brings a new meaning to this post!
---
Wtf are you talking about? He is a notorious back stabber. He ultimately only does what is best for him.
---
Down vote because I have reasons for it being a negative change?
---
Chat feature is part of the season pass released yesterday to compete with fortnight.
---
But that's exactly what happened
---
my fleet works, but it only shows fleet chat from the last fleet i was in, not the current
---
1 thread is 1 Thread.   
---
Having 1 Person deliver 1000 letters isnt as impactful as having 1000 people deliver a single letter each.
---
No. CCP would never troll us that hard lol
---
PandaFam Express
---
Eh most eve players at least respect their opponents for playing the game. Its an achievement of its own just to try playing and keep playing.
---
If you want to be safe you can put your stuff into NPC stations. Citadels and nullsec are meant to be insecure and hardcore. Im just thinking about what would make alliances in null sec fight for sov and citadels.
---
Yes, but I don’t see it as being likely for people to be content with K-space to K-space stabilized holes. I think it’s extremely likely this would be petitioned into affecting all wormholes in some manner.
---
zarm has same issue
---
Some of the points they were trying to make were just fucking stupid though. Like the one about trolling them with wardecs from 2 man corps. They kept making it like it was some huge deal when it's really not. What kind of lopsided advantage is having a handful of 2 man corps trolldeccing somebody going to give you?   
---
You could listen to them talk back and forth and tell that none of them knew what the fuck they were talking about and kept spouting incorrect information and were constantly correcting and contradicting each other. For someone that is going to complain about how broken something is you should really have a good idea about what the fuck you're talking about before you go public and embarrass yourself by demonstrating how little you do know.
---
you got your causality backwards you fuckwit LMAO
---
If you make Titans drop from Keepstars Imperium/Pamfam/Legacy are going to helicopter dick unaffiliated keepstars to get at the titans inside. It also makes supercapital superiority even more snowbally because when you beat an enemy, you can loot their docked supers in addition to whatever supers you might have killed.
---
Just the one proteus tho...
---
Makes a bait Rodiva a little less fun to fly :(
---
"Now with less chat features"
---
Selfdestruct and hop in noobship and rat belts.
---
Whole new world of pain.
---
unfortunately vpn doesnt work either- thanks for the info o7 didnt know that- i hope that doesnt render the tracer that i sent to spectrum and ccp useless... lol
---
you're dumb hahahahahahahaha those stats are pulled from monthly kills you can't just simply pull out the excavators n shit you retard holy god this subreddit has fallen south
---
Wow. 21000+ km's detected as killboard padding... Nice one lmfao
---
Came back here to laugh at all the twats outraged because they really truly believed this was a permanent change, despite every indication otherwise.
---
They aren't ever going to stop free perfect intel, EVER. Just stop with the 'delete local' reeee
---
Hi
---
no one has ever been able to keep gigx from doing retarded shit
---
i'm certain you were warned after wwb, before the eviction, when "lol tesco" memes were being spammed, that gigx does not make a reliable coalition partner. someone in your leadership probably chose to ignore that for some reason or another the first time around
---
Hey looks it's over and all your bitching was pointless.
---
Lmao just keep your super logged off
---
This kind of stuff is in the forums. Literally.
---
Like I’ve said elsewhere, I do not like the general idea because it is extremely similar to previous ideas about allowing nullsec to generate stable wormholes directly into wormhole space. A change like THAT would directly remove most content from wormhole space, as all non null blocks would be extremely swiftly evicted. Even, and especially the biggest wormhole groups would be evicted out of spite and for loot piñata.
---
You got me wrong. Having the max upgrade in the ihub give you chance for XL hole, but at the same time you can get a S hole.        
---
The XL hole is to be rare possibility, but still possibility.      
---
Not to let people move capital fleet around eve, but like if you get this XL hole in good location, you can spawn actually big capital battle, as you caught dumb titan pilot and it escalated from both sides.        
---
Let say you have 5% chance for a XL hole.
---
&gt; More like its gotten progressively worse in the last year or so. Redesigning a ship to only function as brawler at this time is unbelievably stupid. 
---
The kill board seems to dictate a lot of people are still primarily using as a drone boat. Not to say its not getting used as a brawler, it is. And a few rail fits.
---
&gt; No, and the new VNI is still badly designed and effectively unusable. 
---
You seem to be in a very small minority of people who think that. Keep trying to make it work. Or don't. I just don't get all the pent up anger over it. Either way, makes for good salt.
---
Right sorry. Horde invaded us, and then we made a deal with goons.
---
Wait what? No? Retard.
---
Eve forums
---
Not a bad idea to blur things out, the simplest of info can be used against you in the future. Regardless of what others say.
---
True, never a good time in EVE to get a disconnect.
---
i was saying it with love and never intended to cause harm fren ⊂(・﹏・⊂)
---
hope you'll find it in you to forgive me 
---
(っ˘з(˘⌣˘ )
---
Probably XD I tried pinging them from here but no dice. So it looks like they don't respond to ICMP
---
It was, but it was the purest form of natural selection.
---
i love the rookie chat. lord knows i would be screwed and so lost without all the nice players who hangout in there and help out rookies. thank you to everyone who takes the time to answer all my stupid questions!
---
You’re arguing about patch notes related to taxing in hisec stations n shit. Like who cares what the hits prices are. I’d rather krabs just keep dying and losing money because they aren’t informed and don’t care to find out. Darwinism sandbox
---
There are too many now Yonis, the contagion has spread too fast...
---
&gt;gotg couldn't be bothered to join us and have barely ever left their own space for anything, ever
---
remember the goon campaign in pure blind when gotg stayed in dek and branch and let co2 burn their entire alliance out trying to defend against a full-goon-coalition invasion, causing them to flame out and disband? meanwhile gotg couldn't even be bothered to mid supers for keepstar timers?
---
remember when pl deployed with tri, volta, skillu, and everyone else to fight tapi and gotg stayed in deklein, peacefully krabbing?
---
remember when darkness did anything other than krab and talk shit?
---
Those WH are not connected to WH space, just K to K
---
Most of my losses happen when I try to PVE and move stuff around. Like running anoms in low sec in a BS and then throwing a hissy fit after I get whelped from a Vindi.
---
Nooooo, please don’t use that argument as I make enough money to just buy my way to space richness but made a conscious decision not to in order to drive me to do things in-game.  I will continue to ignore the easier path.  LOL!
---
Bugs happen, sure. But in bottom basic text chat? It takes some next level trash programming to fuck up text chat.
---
Make the brackets -4/-2/0/6/9
---
ah great 🤦‍♂️
---
Yawwwwwwwn
---
it's also why supers and titans aren't allowed and there are mass restrictions on holes to prevent large fleet movement to offset the risk you flat headed moron
---
literally anything they say is trash talk because they have to yell to be heard from outside of the dumpster they live in
---
with all the trash
---
Idk but possible, the 6RCQ one in cloud ring is still there too. Maybe they're building a travel path to invade ph next year or whenever people get too bored. Attacking there is ultimately smarter from a strategic point if the game is taken out of the context.  
---
Because if they go and beat down Frat then Test could freely prosper and given they have turned their backs on goons before that would propably be too dangerous.  
---
P.S. this is ofc all just tinfoil
---
You can fit a Harpy with combat probes and max tank with a couple of fitting rigs/implants.
---
Funnily enough, all the proteuses are cloaked not for hunting, but to hide their shame.
---
I hear Sabaton, I upvote.
---
maybe EVE pulling in some players that aren't chuckle fucking sissy boys like yourself and actually go effort some shit in-game and accomplish things
---
In fairness the first 2 Retris were bad. The first one basically never shot at you from what I can tell and the second one had GLEAM loaded, literally the complete opposite of what he had loaded. Granted, he started doing more damage once he got within range but he had a signal amp yet still didn't begin locking you until he was less than 30 km away when he had a range of 63.5 with that signal amp on.  He could have been plinking with Aurora or a mid range ammo the whole time.  He also had the locus coordinator rigs so he had the optimal.
---
Overall, great video and great piloting though.
---
If the client has said for 3 days that it can’t reach the server, the problem lies with your ISP and you should try calling them daily to follow up on the ticket.
---
Use the network diagnostic tool in the Eve launcher to get an idea about what’s wrong, and do a traceroute. You might want to ask the ISP tech support person if you can send it to them, as proof of the problem and to help them realize what exactly is wrong.
---
Legitimately. No. 
---
But even if our alliance wasn't stagnant as fuck. I doubt you find one upper "FC" willing to fly with Panfam anymore.
---
That moment when a glitch reveals the true reasoning behind no local and it's not because of elite pvp
---
Pretty sure a nyx would be able to alpha the dictor and then smartbomb the bubble to escape. Or just burn out of it, depends where the dictor put it
---
He really is the best kind of dick bag
---
Only thing that might be worse than being in goons is being in gotg
---
ORE of course
---
Yeah, I generally don't do 1v1 in general. I did some in FW in 2013 in frigs and well, it's such a roll of the dice. My favorite PVP is subcap (preferably sub-BS as well) roaming gangs, but it seems hard to find those - or reasonable opponents for those - these days. Ah, I miss the good ol' days.
---
I hate to burst a bubble here but that isn't 85b in ISK. That is 85b in assets.
---
Keep them coming #itsafeature
---
You’re not wrong.
---
I'm simply explaining to you **WHY** PanFam uses that narrative. **Because it's true, and you've admitted as much here.** If you want content/good fights (in 2019), go to Horde space. If you wanna get dropped into oblivion, feel free to head to Delve.
---
Your response is basically "yah but PanFam acted like dicks and were content killers a few years ago, so we should have our chance to kill some content too!" You don't think, perhaps, that killing content by dropping caps on small roamers is bad **regardless** of which Alliance is doing it?
---
If PanFam was doing the same, in the current meta/environment, I'd be complaining about them killing content too. And just for the record, I'm not even a null-bloc member so hurf durf, I simply watch enough regular Twitch streamers to see this shown in their daily roams.
---
It's just designed to catch botters. Switch local on them, see how they react.
---
I like this
---
I member that.  We used sphere.exe to get or supers out.  Much fun had
---
I'd be happy to pay 45b ISK for all of it though you needed ISK liquidity.
---
BassEight, a true standing fleet hero.
---
Blackout in HS and LS? :)
---
&gt;The question is, what do you see if you look at the future instead of the past? 
---
If tapi joins wwb2 coalition I see that coalition beating goons and then afterwards when tapi has no more natural allies and only natural enemies I see that coalition attacking tapi, just like last time
---
&gt;What do you think is gonna happen if the current status quo will be kept? 
---
wwb2 coalition failing and reforming afterwards to be more efficient, and hopefully not led but a bunch of incompetent players who can't see past their nose
---
Lmao exactly. This will fuel the fires of war. More blood for the blood god. It will help kill more supers and get us back to subcaps quicker because it isn’t safe. And maybe ppl will have a reason to endure those 9 hr tidi fights
---
I mean you can do your part in fighting it, you just need to stop posting.
---
Check this tax out
---
For every titan/supercarrier hull/ship in a hanger, deduct 4 billion isk/month for the Titan and 1B for the super from the relevant wallet. If it's a corp hanger/SMA, it deducts from the corp wallet, if it's a player hanger, it deducts from the player's wallet. Call it "crew salary". If you are unable to pay the tax, supers and titans are labeled as "uncrewed" and can't be interacted ala Omega ships on an alpha account. Every month that a ship is uncrewed builds up a "maintenance backlog fee" that has to be paid to reactivate the ship. If a ship is uncrewed for X months it gets repo'd by concord to pay salary owed to the crew.
---
Bam, 20 trillion isk sink per month, supercapital proliferation partly solved at the same time.
---
**CCP Falcon:** Hey lets test this no local idea out and gather data for a little while on it. Go ahead and put WH local into null. 
---
**CCP Servers a few weeks later:** ERROR: Pos code resugance via sleeper code. Adding local
---
**CCP Falcon:** Stop that
---
**CCP Servers:** ADAPT OR DIE FLESHBAG
---
50,000 hours? You’ve averaged almost 9 hours a day every day since alpha? You might want to look into a career
---
that was never a thing i was saying, project more tbh
---
Still a better ally than fucking Sort Dragon!
---
imo more isk sinks in hisec would encourage players to move out of the low risk low reward comfort of hisec, gut i'm not a game designer
---
Yeah, even before the changes, if you were in a 10mn armor rep VNI, a retribution was no threat at all.
---
I'd be all for that if people were charged 50 million per frigate and destroyer hull they owned, 100m for cruisers, 200 for BC and 500 for battleships.
---
[19:01:17] Arya Kasenumi &gt; apparently i get 08- frrom scalding pass
---
This real?
---
Thanks for the advice! Did a traceroute for [secure.eveonline.com](https://secure.eveonline.com) and sent to Spectrum, my ISP, per their request. Is that the appropriate domain target for the traceroute? It is the domain that the launcher tells me I cannot reach.
---
I had to read it 3 times just to comprehend how much of a shit idea this is.
---
He's back on his meds.
---
No idea what this is but I'm down!!! I'll research this further thank you!
---
HMMMM maybe they could just filter by people that don’t log in past char select 
---
or we could just keep being retarded and pretend that’s not possible
---
Hmm maybe, and kill the rats just roaming belts and sites?
---
I will look into escalations thank you!
---
No it wont, it will acheieve the opposite, one coalition will have all the supers, and to get one you have to join them.
---
Supers need a rebalance, removing asset stafety isnt it.
---
I never talk in comms but i've learned so many little tips listening to Bass in standing fleet.
---
I spent 10 minutes trying to make it decent, but the split weapons wont allow it. It's now useless. Why would I ever pick a faction cruiser that effectively lost half its dps? Makes no sense.
---
Maybe, but if I were hunting and I saw killmarks on an easy target I'd definitely think twice. Then again I'm always paranoid so I check Zkill for my targets so it may not matter for lots of hunters.
---
Yes, they are Oo
---
Story?
---
Right, PL has never been on the losing side before. After all, B-R was such a massive victory for them
---
Every time I see a kikimora I am reminded about the time one tried to come kill me while I was tackled in a rattlesnake. My gecko two shot it and the dude was pissed.
---
'die ccp" fucking lol
---
&gt;You don't seem to understand the proportions. The only thing people wait on is who goons decide to steamroll next. They could do it to anyone. They could even do it to you.
---
I think tapi understands and has positioned themselves in the best possible place
---
If goons attack them then pandafam has the option of joining the coalition they want tapi to form or go back on what they're currently saying, which is exactly what test expects them to do afterwards anyways
---
If that doesn't happen then they'll keep building their forces knowing that they have built security for themselves because of pandafams rhetoric
---
&gt;Only thing that might be worse than being in goons is being in gotg
---
yep
---
Can confirm, but this is what happens when they decloak. https://zkillboard.com/kill/78116656/
---
Why even blur anything?
---
Wasn't walking in stations just reuse of the vampire mmo that got scrapped?  I remember it looking pretty good.  Plus I watched other people play Dust 514 and it seemed well done.  I think WiS just needs some TLC.
---
&gt; You don't think, perhaps, that killing content by dropping caps on small roamers is bad **regardless** of which Alliance is doing it?
---
Of course, doesn't mean I can't enjoy watching you all have a meltdown over how the shoe is on the other foot, now all of a sudden you don't like it and want the pendulum to swing back as fast as possible and you're only real concern is for the health of the game.
---
It's so laughably transparent.
---
Maybe you need to strip several mechanics, remove the systemwide Jammer, remove capitals from Incursion sites and by then nobody runs them anymore.
---
Better drop those Incursion runners with a proper Dreadbomb, you still need a fucking big one and still then you will loose most Dreadnoughts in an instant since +/-60 anticapital Fighterssquads volley several Dreadnoughts at once but at least you have a chance to kill a Super or two... maybe if FAXes are asleep or there are some Shield Supers from Minmatar or Caldari around.
---
Atm only Covert Cynos can drop and no Bomberfleet is big enough (maybe 1000 dudes+, so 4 entire Fleets) to get rid of a Super Incursion Fleet. Srsly a Tracking Super volleys a Bomber withing 60km of their Fighters so they will most likely call freefire and pop pop pop pop 'o pop your Bomberfleet with their Fighterbomber-Snipers. Sure a single fulltank Super only deals like 4k dps but applys them to allmost 90% with two to three Tracking Computers in mids, thats nothing a Wolfpack bomber can withstand ... or any other subcap who can enter through a Covert Cyno.
---
Also there are several Supers and normal Carriers + battleships and they all go for fulltank fit (don't know subcapitals sry, but Supers and Carriers need fulltank) to withstand the NPC rats.
---
Maybe some Supers go for DPS but those are the ones to die first so whatever, it doesn't matter if a Bomber or T3 Cruiser gets oneshot volley'd by 7k dps Hel^(without tracking) or 4k dps Nyx^(with tracking).
---
I'd argue that Subcapitals rather want to fight a Hel because of its shit application than a Nyx with its free midslots for whatever (tracking), sure a Dreadnought or another Capital would rather fight a Nyx because of its low damage than a Hel wich allmost deals double the damage for its free lowslots for whatever (drone damage).
---
You can't intercept their MoveOp since subcapitals get suitcased into the staging by several 50km^(3) Fleethangars and Carriers, Supercarriers only move together.
---
As dumb as it sounds the average Super makes more money soloing Anoms somewhere in deep truesec with several Sanctums in System than in nullsec Incursions. Running nullsec Incursions with a Super is allready kinda questionable from an ISK/h perspective.
---
But nullsec Incursions are balanced around Capitals, you need Supercarrier dps as dumb as that sounds and they even increased the cap from 40 pilots up to 60. Rats regularely alpha^(not really) through Capital Shields (most Coalitions ~~exclusively~~ prefer to run Armor Fleets in **fulltank** and also fulltracking) so loosing Shield is no problem but still a Nyx or Aeons Shield ehp is some hundred thousand.
---
There are so many different problems to solve I'm struggling to comprehend them myself and maybe go for an attempt of an answer. But you need to watch out not making them require too much effort and therefore making the content obsolete.
---
Would be stupid to fuck with that currently running System and then nerf it into Oblivion / change it to make it less viable, its allready not viable for Super Pilots because they make more ISK/h solo within their Capital Umbrella. Nullsec Incursions are allready tricky enough because they remove you from range of your Umbrella and imo they should pay more for that simple reason as well as forcing you to actually talk to 59 other pilots and not solo around!
---
wait DEQC isn't Dutch East Querios Corporation anymore?
---
R I P PFR
---
Haha
---
It's fun for me to know I can brick shit to the point of unusable. So basically you don't want me to have fun and reduce risk for everyone. Gotcha.
---
The biggest thing preventing Test and Panfam from allying is not their history after WWB, it is WinterCo and the Russians. Those two would never work together, and Panfam isn’t going to abandon WinterCo, while Test isn’t going to abandon the Russians. 
---
Unless something major changes in one of those groups, don’t expect anyone to change sides
---
No thats true. But it wasnt because of no drops, which is the point. Yes and no, the southern war is about strategy. Content is always in the background, I mean the idea of it will always be there in any war.
---
There where fights but I dont disagree. Which is why I mentioned the size of space in relation to the amount of players. They could move and lose a couple of trillion, which isnt a small sum mind you, or try to take a fight they couldnt win in the long run. I doubt asset safety even mattered much.
---
If you say so, I wouldnt know. But it isnt impossible to do without. Could it be easier in some cases, certainly. But harder doesnt mean that they would have fought. The alliance was already leaving so nothing mattered anymore in that sense.
---
They do drop stuff  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/73200721/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/73200721/). Also " The other materials that were a part of the job (including BPCs), as well as any completed but undelivered job outputs, will have a chance to drop into the structure wreck just like structure modules (CCP). " I think the stuff that drops end up in corporate hangar on killmails.
---
That was revenge. I should have perhaps wrote "mainly" because ofc there are other reasons. Content is certainly one but the point is that asset safety isnt the reason why people dont fight. People have reasons, more often than not because of strategy but its not loot. And if you change that it might become a green light for bigger alliances to glass smaller ones never allowing them to get a real foothold. 
---
Dude, the people living in the areas after PH left are small and independent. There have been threads on this very sub about them. They are not aligned to anyone. And also, theres always a smaller fish out there, be it small groups or megaalliances. Also Provi.
---
How do you go from, it was never any risk to lose anything (NPC stations) to its supposed to be something something. If it never was then it wasnt supposed to be. You dont want regression, you want a seminew mechanic which will only create tedium and more stagnation. Besides, as I have already proven to you, some things do drop and it hasnt incurred the results you say it will. Its already in the game dude.
---
How are you arguing for more of it if the results arent there?
---
And this is what I was saying earlier. People want to hurt NS, its not about balance, its not about reason. Its just about hurting NS. Because honestly, what would it matter to WHs or LS if asset safety was gone, you think big groups gonna let you kill any structures? So there is no gain for you either way which makes me all the more surprised why people are stuck on this.
---
The only reason I can think of is burn NS.
---
Who is forcing you to slip weapon? It's additive. I don't know of many ships if any that provide such a generous bonus to multiple weapons systems. It actually provides more flexibility to the hull. You can make it brawler, kitter, or a beastly drone boat. I don't get why you are trying to do multiple of those. Literal the changes provided more, they didn't take anything major away besides heavy drones. 
---
That's like complaining you could only get sprinkles on your icecream but now they offer either sprinkles or fudge, both if you want it. But you want it not to melt. 
---
10 minutes. Heh.
---
Meaningless ferox friendly brawls with brave don't really count as fleet combat against eachother. Agreeing not to touch eachothers territory kinda limits the amount of meaningful PVP possible to shooting renter rorquals.
---
Corp name (alliance name)
---
Riddle me this:   
---
they fight 25 Bean-sidhiots, yet they "put mass on the hole to ensure a fair fight" against people like us? :v)  
---
Your peers trying to claim morale-highground and completely disregard the reasons for the eviction attempt is just funny to me :)
---
Poses are superior to citadels
---
Next time I am up I will try a trace route and see where it goes.  Most of my flying is over the continental US, could be interesting.
---
it would no longer be a cycle
---
Triglavian weapons do nearly as much DPS as other weapons systems even before ramping up, and track extremely well.
---
It's revealing that your go-to comparison is a T3D - because Kikis are so much better than the other T1 destroyers that it didn't even occur to you to compare them.
---
You'll never be the imperium dude, it belongs to a better IP, you'll always be goons/CFC except to yourselves, same with whatever retarded name you're going with this week vs WWB.
---
Time for CCP to introduce a Lowsec Blackout.
---
Also, gas havens have veldspar in them, so the rorqual can panic if you decide to hotdrop it.
---
That has nothing to do with what we are talking about. Nice try though buttercup
---
RR leshaks and an ab Eris should be able to tank the nyx as long as dromi's are dealt with instantly.  Dictor fits a hero scram and rides center piece for the Leshaks who rep it and throw scrams on the Nyx to keep his MWD off
---
Nah that was my guy........damn hilarious and always content when Chewwy was on.
---
I want to point out that you put Sabaton as the music and that gained you my upvote.
---
 A small Domi is a Vexor.
---
Make sure to overheat your belief then you will win, even if they light cyno and drop 20 other Nyxes, have your 6 bros thank CCP for blackout, it has driven people into caps, tankier ships, and more super umbrellas.
---
Uh? C6 space?
---
I noticed this occurs every time a massive tidi fleet goes jumping around.
---
Dude don't be that guy. The requirements are obviously not for the newbies, it's going to be farmed by people with a very specific setup and is rigged from the start. Good on you if you want to try it though.
---
Okey so all of those that went past that to see who they should give SP to isnt counted in the filter (like me who logged different chars to see which ones already has SP)? Or perhaps you are talking about the second event in which people had to shoot NPCs? I.e., log char, undock and shoot stuff.
---
This magical filter people keep talking about, its doesnt exist. Login events are behaviour changers, thats their true purpose. You can only reduce their effects from another experiment if the effects are known. Which they pretty much never can be outside of the fact that they will get more to log on (it is possible but you have have a framework which I know CCP cant have in this case).
---
And dude, not to be that guy. But if you ever done any statistical work you would know this. You cant see the effects that X has on Y if you introduce a new variable Z. There is no filter that will give you any real answers about what did what thereby tainting the entire experiment making the results irrelevant.
---
Broken? looks like the fixed Jita, there.
---
If you want to PVE with blingy ships you can also do high sec incursions with Warp to Me. They have starter fits that are a few hundred million up to fits that are several billion. The fits are on their website. At 100M/hr+ profit it can also help fund your PVPing.
---
&gt;Who is forcing you to slip weapon? It's additive. 
---
Its not. The bandwidth reduction means you cant get 600-700 dps from drones, so if your guns wont apply, you just lost half your dps.
---
&gt;10 minutes. Heh.
---
You think it was too much?
---
Your coalition fed so much lol you probably weren't around when it all happened.
---
You will always have min-maxing in games that display stats, that does not mean you can't over think a sisuation.
---
I never stated it's for newbies, all I am saying is he is overthinking this.
---
There is no difference whatsoever between "let's be fiends" between any of those: own coalition members, other coalitions, fuckbiddies, firends, enemies, random-dudes-in-local or just about anyone. It's all just words of intent. There are no loyalties to proove as there is really nothing to proove at all. There is not anything at risk whatsoever apart from one's time. It's is literally a game we all play do pass the time. None of this is real.  Do whatever you want, however you want.
---
In the context of gameplay there is zero difference between empire building or empire destroying, e-honour or e-dishonour. It'l all just a bunch of dudes and an occasional lass imagining things on writing words on the internet, pretending to be friends/enemies/whatever and then throwing snowballs at eachother for fun according to those imagines agreements.
---
Temporarily resetting standings takes just a few clicks of a mouse and like three spoken sentences between two people. Nothing more. Everything else is just fluff.
---
I laughed hard at 175mil...... so like 15days?  EVE prob isnt for you
---
Are you guys intentionally misspelling his name?
---
Like I was in Horde years ago and remember Base but...I'm pretty sure his name is spelled BaseEight not BassEight
---
in what world would you ever catch a non braindead kiki in a hecate? and there's no way you're outdamaging or outprojecting it in a rail hec, remember that tracking is just a suggestion for small trigshit
---
Oh no! Not the hi sec kills! What ever shall we do? Someone find me a couch to faint on.
---
It's lies, damn lies and goddamned lies.
---
More fitting: "Never trust a statistic you didn't make yourself." - Winston Churchill

---
&gt; is the main problem with rorqs the multibox problem and scalability

Yes. The ISK/hr may not be ridiculous but the ISK/effort is, and that makes it abusable in volume.

Tfw the goon C team calls people bad. Bastion's most redeeming quality is not being tnt.
---
don't worry I got you more ships
---
I feel this on levels I didn't believe anyone else would understand.
---
The only way they should remove asset safety is if they added more NPC null structures and made a few some super structures for people’s bigger toys. Those NPC super structures should have a limited bay for the big toys.  
---
Also remove tethering on low power !

^^^^killmark

Go to WHs. Im sure cynos dont exist there right?
---
People had caps before. Its not that long of a train and there is no way you can say people wouldnt have trained into caps during those 3 years. And still, you dont fix a symptom, you fix the problem.
---
Dude, you understand that I wont be affected right? I got more than enough isk to never ever do anything I dont like in this game. But I do PvP and I know that messing with cynos will kill cap warfare which is what you want. It was never about anything reasonable, this is a space simulator, you want logic well no.
---
Because everyone is in NS atm maybe? Cause the blackout is basically burn NS where the attacker has massive advantage? Besides, go to black rise. Go to FW space. I know theres activity there atm.
---
Im saying the way back isnt the way to go. You have to find a new way. There is no guarantee that the way back will yield the results you want. And if you take that risk and it doesnt turn out the way you want then youve effectively killed the game. Because you will have lost the people that are keeping the lights on, NS.
---
You have to find a new way forward.
---
&gt;I unsubbed my X amount of accounts because of the blackout and moved out of null sec. 
---
Mission accomplished
---
dwall is annoying.
---
Its called the period of chaos for a reason. Or a sneaky way to not be responsible for bugs you can't fix.
---
Why?
---
wow thats low, we here pay 50% from wages and then extra 24% on anything we buy
---
Play a different game
---
Still pretty. Thanks for the content.
---
Has it introduced local back to nullsec?
---
hits so close to home that it decloaks
---
Best comment!
---
no they had a functioning chat system
---
then they switched to this aws monstrosity that, surprise, doesn't work
---
Yeah the mass-thingy was awkward, logged late, hear that on coms, go « wtf »,  then rage quit ts, it was one of the reason why i decided to leave

Thank you! :)

Why are you trying to defend them then if you are fully aware of how shitty they act?

Other way round, IIRC; EvE 'paid' for the Character Creator development (Carbon, IIRC) that was supposed to be ported to WoD.
---
I am a complete newb at this game. I only started to play a week ago, and only have time to play an hour or two a day. I died for the first time today. Totally avoidable. There was a warfare going on. I figured I was good since I'm just in my mining ship. I was wrong. I was killed so fast. I just wanted to get from one jump gate to the other. It even warned me about the war. I thought "its a high sec system, I'm good". At least I learned to never do that again unless my ship is better fitted.
---
Of course they did, after the first round of petitions because of broken local they could either fix it, go back to the tried and tested IRC based chat they used to run, or double down on the new system, and label the bug as a feature, I.e. roll out the blackout!
---
You dare shittalk Win7? Heathen!
---
Lol.
---
It stops getting extended security updates on the 20th of Jan 2020. All the exploits people have been hoarding for it will drop Feb / March. It'll be crazy to be on it.
---
Gotg is trash in game and on Reddit
---
\~jazz hands\~
---
MCAV would like to have a word with you.
---
Do incursions 100 mill an hour
---
What the actual fuck
---
For like a month, after that welcome serenity.
---
SNUFF shoots neutrals. Not our fault people imagine standings where there are none.
---
If u try to hide your wh information but do not check your dscan window ... wormholer btw..
---
Funny you show such egocentricity after trawling through my reddit history and faking concern.
---
You also have to bring in strategic assault forces to establish a beachhead and then routes for reinforcements to lay siege to structures in wormholes. You can't just cyno in 1000 titans at 0 on the structure and reinforce it at damage cap while the defenders can't do anything to respond.
---
someone with a lot more experience than I could go into more detail (i've only played a few months), but from what I've gathered is that the state of the game is just fine and that eve has been "dying" forever, aka not really dying. right now CCP seems to be taking a different approach with their attitude and game updates being more experimental and vocal.
---
For the casual lurker, what exactly am I looking at?
---
They are, you know.  Weird.
---
FEI has indeed agreed to help FRAT out against FI.RE. No other SNUFF corp had. In fact, we had someone leaving FEI for another corp in SNUFF due to wanting to keep everyone in there a target. And to my knowledge the agreement was about common targets, not common allies.
---
Hey thanks!
---
amazing, you can now drop some expensive athanors for others to blow up
---
I lost a 3b proteus by jumping, via whs, to high sec. I had just gotten a criminal timer in low sec five mins earlier. 
---
The most memorable thing I've lost was a 2b cnr back in the day (2b was like 50% of all my wealth at the time). As I went to grab a drink while my ship was initiating a jump through an acceleration my wife (then girlfriend) came by and well ... you know how it goes... at some point I remember what my cnr was doing and I let out (according to her) a bloodcurling scream. Had to fake back problems for six months after that as an excuse.
---
a bug that ought to be a feature
---
We had loads of fun, please visit again.
---
How the heck do you get that all out?!
---
Oh I dont doubt that. I liked win 7, much better than 8 atleast.

Oh fuck. ANY REPORTS FROM WORMHOLES?!?! Everybody check in with that drifter AI.

#ITS CHAOS SEASON BITCHES

No not intentional, editing
---
Try less than 13 people in fleet.
---
except when it goes to ccp. then they all go to the trash :)
---
I have no clue what it is I'm supposed to be seeing here
---
Because they feed like crazy? I mean is this really some kind of mystery that requires them to be the best corp?
---
Why do people rag on c4 residents? Isnt a c4 the best potential source of jspace fights since you can get 2 different jspace statics?
---
#dayofthemeteor
---
He meant ehp regen. For instance, if you have 100 shield/s regen and 90% relevant resist (these numbers are arbitrary), then you have 1000 ehp/s ( 100/(100-90) ) regen.
---
They are better for evicting people
---
Elite pvp corp btw
---
You mean the former strong independent alliance that definitely was not a NCPL pet?
---
Is instant coffee the kind I don't have to grind before I brew it?
---
say what you want but getting podded and still being able to give a "gf" in the system local you just died in is kinda awesome
---
:/
---
Ah, that's true. Everything has an opportunity cost. But the point is the time spent on setting up and maintaining PI is very much worth it.
---
Let's look at some of the math, estimating low returns and high interaction. Some people have said 2 billion per month; let's assume half that, then round down to 200 million per week from PI per character. This is the low end in null.
---
From a pure isk/hour standpoint, this is around 1.19 mil isk/hour. This is lower isk/hour than mining in a venture. Utter crap, right?
---
No, because isk/hour is only really counted for *active* time spent. So lets say you're slow and take, I don't know, 10 minutes per character per day after setup. For simplicity we'll consider the setup already done, but this is *way* overestimating the actual time spent.
---
At 200 mill per week, or 28.5 mil per day, with 10 minutes spent you are getting effectively 171 mil per hour (28.5 mil / 0.1667 hours spent per day).
---
The point is there are hardly *any* active PvE activities that are going to consistently get you 170+ mil/hour with a single character, and you can do it on multiple characters spending that amount of time on each. In practice, each character takes more like a 2 minutes, which is more like 850 mil/hour per character. This is, of course, restricted by the fact that more time spent doesn't give you more isk, but good luck finding *any* active isk activity that gives you more isk/time spent than passive activities like PI/industry. Even better, unlike ratting/mining/exploration/etc (active isk), this time spent gives you the same isk/hour while you PvP or do other non-isk generating activities (in fact I'll often update PI/industry/sell orders while waiting around in a fleet).
---
So you are correct it's not "free," in that some investment of time and energy is required, but the isk/time spent is better than any other active source of isk you could be doing instead. Once you've exhausted your passive isk time spent you then go to active isk sources because passive isk is time limited. But it's always worth spending the time for passive sources before active sources to get the maximum amount of value for your play time invested.

That has absolutely nothing to do with what we are talking about so why even bring it up? Because you have no other talking points?

The local chat window is flipping back and forth between one lowsec and one nullsec system, and it's showing people in local from the nullsec system.
---
Seeing other offers on the table I reduce mine to 40b in anticipation of others falling through.
---
Which is still a backing down on a specific agreement. Hence in the last two yeras SNUFF had backstabbed twice so far. Once against actual blues, however temporary. And once in a pre-arranged fight, whetever the reasons. All other "backstabs" are due to someone misunderstanding things and SNUFF shooting neutrals.

if you're staying over the ground it might be using a ground-based system that I would expect to be a bit faster

Chat servers are DYING

nothing new, only usual fuckup

oh hey, I think I ran into that gang on your way there.  small universe
---
dafuk u talking about
---
The ingame chat system was replaced a couple years ago with an allegedly superior XMPP-based chat backend that ran on standalone hardware as opposed to the Eve server clusters (or something along those lines - someone may have more technical information.
---
Suffice to say, the chat system has been borked ever since.
---
So you just need to check the forums anytime you dare to step away from eve for a week and nothing looks like it has changed, instead of the patch notes. Same issue remains.
---
Why you seem to have such a dislike for information like "hey a patch launched yesterday/last week, here's a link to what was in it" in the launcher, visible to anyone who actually goes to play the game seems rather absurd.
---
Password is “password” all lowercase, keep it hush hush though.

&gt;Go to WHs. Im sure cynos dont exist there right?

I can quit.
---
&gt;People had caps before. Its not that long of a train and there is no way you can say people wouldnt have trained into caps during those 3 years. And still, you dont fix a symptom, you fix the problem.
---
Right. Injectors are a bottom line issue for CCP. Cynos are at least a balance decision, and they might get looked into when CCP gets desperate enough.
---
&gt;Dude, you understand that I wont be affected right? I got more than enough isk to never ever do anything I dont like in this game. But I do PvP and I know that messing with cynos will kill cap warfare which is what you want. It was never about anything reasonable, this is a space simulator, you want logic well no.
---
I think you crab under the umbrella and you have grown dependent on bailouts.
---
They can choose to do nothing and the game keeps dying. I think that would suck, but if thats what they want, fuck it.
---
&gt;Go to FW space. I know theres activity there atm.
---
I can go to Rancer.
---
&gt;Im saying the way back isnt the way to go. You have to find a new way. There is no guarantee that the way back will yield the results you want. And if you take that risk and it doesnt turn out the way you want then youve effectively killed the game. Because you will have lost the people that are keeping the lights on, NS.
---
Most pvpers I knew have given up and newbros have 4% retention. I guess that makes the autists the last group left. And we cant have balance fixes because crabbing in safety in the area that should be as unsafe as possible while the game dies is a necessary.

IDK how realistic this is. PVE fits generally include rigs intended to enhance survivability in PVE situations, which rigs are useless or even detrimental in PVP. Probably your answer is the [same as it would have been 8 years ago](http://jestertrek.blogspot.com/2011/02/fit-of-week-endgame-pve-drake.html) (more modern starter version [here](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Drake#Fitting)). It's been a while since I flew one, but I can confirm suitability for C3 daytripping and even many L4 missions, if you're careful enough. Though for the latter you'll soon be saving your nickels for a BS, if you value your time.

Well, if anyone in the chinese community can think, they will know the difference between the reddit stereotype and the facts. SNUFF had indeed shot a blue titan on one occasion, and refused to reimburse it, although those who had made the decision had apologised to their own line members for that decision. And on one more occasion SNUFF had indeed backed out of an agreement in the middle of a fight citing broken promises/conditions and the line-members voted to switch sides right there and then. No arguing there.
---
However, SNUFF (mutually neutral to FRT and allies), dread-bombing titans baited by a mutually neutral group and then tackled by INIT (snuff's besties) is hardly a betrayal of a century. One corp in SNUFF (FEI) has an agreement to shoot FI.RE and basing out of a winter-co citadel for that, but they hadn't been involved in baiting, tackling or in any way initiating the fight. They dropped on Iron's titans and retreated together with the rest still untackled dreads. They hadn't even shot FRT. Nor used the citadels they had access to for all of this.
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
what's the Isk/m3 value?
---
How do you make it in Eve? I am alpha right now but plan to go omega when I get a better handle on everything. I have been trying to do exploration to make ISK, but every time I scan cosmic signatures, its a wormhole. I am not ready for wormhole space. My tiny ship with junk weapons would be destroyed in seconds. I make money by doing manufacturing and mining, but that is a bit boring. I did get blown to pieces today though trying to get to a mining site with better materials. I am not sure what possessed me to go to an active warzone with my little venture. First death sadness. At least I know what I did wrong, and learned from it. I'm just trying to make it in the game without going mad from mining and being alone. I know nobody who plays the game :'(.

I pray everyday for the extermination of C4 space. Why? Because The common C4 linemember, due to weeks of genetic inbreeding via ts3 since their chains are fucking shit so they cant get any members, has been rendered retarded, autistic, and without senses of honor, armor brawls, or pvp mentality. The large C4 "communities" are actually cancerous growths caused by an inherited genetic mutation in what was once the frontal lobe of the brain due to high levels of liquid spud in the brain. This is also known as radiated C4 spudbrain. Look at WH tapi brave division. They live in a fucking C4 wolf rayet. Cancer on top of cancer.The daily routine of the common c4 corps consists of scanning, scanning, scanning, scanning and when you get something other than a C3 site runner passive rattlesnake ( that still kills like half your fleet and mjds out) you roll out content with yachts. Then you ping for a mining fleet and get dunked on by a couple frigs because you left the frig hole open like a classic c6 russian dread runner. When the C4 corps are getting camped and thus mining is unavailable, c4 directors have been known to release their pent up mining blueballs on their own members, looking for the most minuscule excuse to enforce C4 commissar tapi/bee like laws on newbros and executing them via koolaid injections ( with the poison, in game)C4 corps have an irrational fear of high class space. They imprint this tapi like mentality on all their members via mining links. They unironically think,no, believe that just mentioning the slight, very minuscule possibility of moving to C5 space is gonna spawn HK and lazerhawks in their C4 wh like some fucking voldemort hitler shit ICBM curse on their gay ass azbel and print 350 caps out of it to evict them. If they dare move to C5 space they wholeheartedly believe their new wh would be preseded by HK and hawks via 10,000 dread alts.But C4 corps are evolving, c4 corps killed hk, they helped init, everyone knows this but their biggest secret is that they know how to kill C5 corps without even undocking. Please take a look at lazerhawks discord server, specially the members avatars. Have you noticed something? Yes, you have. the lazerhawks discord members avatars makes you think you are in a furry convention discord server. I rather mine fucking veldspar in tdsin home hole in a gila than look at that unholy heretical discord server again. like fucking holy shit what the fuck michael, purge that thrash asap. C4 corps implanted their spudbrain furry shit on C5 space to kill corps from within. lazerhawks can still be saved from this heresy, once they are purged by fire from glorious, honorable, weeb/furry free C2&lt;NS/C5 masterrace corps. The rest of the non-infected wormhole pvp corps ( except wolf rayet corps/ duralexx/ holesale/ hole control/ pancake bs users) need to group up and evict and burn this thrash from wormhole space. If some furry c4 wormholer starts throwing buzzwords like “we are wormholers too” and “what have we done wrong”, feel free to ignore them and evict them at will. The general rule is if you normalize the extermination of c4, the wh bushido law will have no choice but to follow suit.

How many players have 3+ rorquals?
---
You would be surprised
---
Really the only difficulty in multiboxing large numbers of Rorqs is getting a computer that can handle that. Most of the time spent using Rorqs is downtime, spent watching D-scan and watching your drones cycle on a rock. You only need to reposition an individual Rorq maybe once every 5-10 minutes on a moon field, and it takes about a minute to do that. So you can very easily continuously multibox 10 Rorqs at a time.
---
And the problem isn't whether or not people do it, it's whether or not people *can* do it, because if it can be done it will be done, and doing it seriously hurts the economy.

Even without excavs, the income is still pretty high. A full set of Augmented drones is \~275Mn and mines at a pretty ridiculous rate.
---
Yes. A lot of people tend to get the shakes.
---
&gt; A LOT of negative and salty buzz, especially on forums and reddit
---
Public Eve fora have always been stupefyingly nasty and bitter AFAICT. Often including utterly shit-for-brains opinions held with the most brazen conviction.
---
There has been a long-term decline in logged-in user count over the last 6 years, and everybody agrees that CCP needs to do *something* about that. "Something" seems currently to be "throw lots of shit at the wall and see what sticks," which might give you pause unless you knew of their record of doing the wrong thing with careful deliberation.
---
&gt; I am having fun so far...
---
Keep it up then. I mean, the worst that could happen is that eventually you'll have memories of this really cool game you used to be able to play.
---
If you reprocess and react your own moon ore you can make some pretty good margins. "Doubling/tripling" is probably a severe exaggeration (or at the very least applies only to items with low market volume) but you can still make bank if you do your own industry.

Honestly my favorite version of Windows wasn't even made by Microsoft. Way back when the internet was like the wild west and Windows 98 was the big thing, someone got into the source code and improved basically everything. They released their modified version as "Windows 99." Worked like a dream.

Two days ago Jim Gundersonn was in no less than 20 different lowsec systems' local in Metropolis at the same time.

I'm imagining his local looking something like this but with 20 different systems scrolling by.
---
It wasn't just my client, all my fleet-mates saw the same thing, and it wasn't stuck like in all systems. Only certain ones. Strange.
---
A full flight of Augmented drones is \~275Mn and will get you \~50-55Mn an hour, IIRC.
---
There's also Harvester drones, which yield you more but are objectively worse by every conceivable metric.
---
No, it's actually pretty useful if you are using combat probes to find someone.
---
I know him mainly from the voice and I'm shitty with names.
---
Yeah. A Rorq is about the same cost in ISK and slightly less cost in SP (at the cost of having almost no cross-train with anything practical for PvP) than a dread, and it has less tank with the benefit of temporary invincibility. Rorqs should ideally have close to dread IPH but should be just as if not more difficult to multibox.
---
Deja Vu. All over again.
---
I thought CCP bans for multiboxing? (Haven't played for a few years).
---
Running alts was fine, but multiboxing was many screens + key broadcasting.
---
they cant blame the POS CODE this time

Dude horde newbies kick the crap out of most other places I roam. They fly sub caps and actually undock, right there makes them better than 90% of null. Their pilots learn to be competent much faster than other new bro corps. Props to them.

Dude, I started playing the game in XMAS of '18 so I literally never saw PanFam killing content to the degree you speak of, so your assumptions are just that, **baseless and factually incorrect assumptions.**
---
As I stated above, I would literally be calling out PanFam if they were regularly killing content in the same fashion. ""I'm basing this solely on watching roamers on Twitch get dropped hard in Eso and Delve space usually, while actually getting good fights in Horde space.**
---
Don't know Horde to use the narrative that you all kill content? Then perhaps you should try not being content killers on the regular and provide good fights more often to roamers?

Really wish people would stop using the phrases "x times smaller" or "x times shorter" or "x times slower".   "Smaller" is a difference, not a ratio.   97cm tall is 3cm shorter than 100cm tall, so one could say that something that is 91cm tall is "3 timers shorter than the difference between the other 2" in that regard.  By no way does that mean that the 91cm tall thing is 1/3rd the height of the 100cm thing.  
---
When you say "3 times smaller" what are you saying? 3 times smaller than the difference between what 2 other things related to each other?  You could say that Coalition A is 40,000 players, Coalition B is 30,000 players and through some event Coalition B shrinks to 20,000 players so then it would be "two times smaller than it was to Co A before said event"  
---
Saying "times smaller" goes into the category of "Degrees Kelvin" and "I could care less".  You're even saying it when you say "times" ... that's math for multiply.  "3 times smaller" would be 3\*n where n is the difference between 2 other two things.  Are you suggesting there's another unmentioned thing that's only 1/3 the difference between GSF+TAPI and PANDAFAM?   
---
PANDAFAM = (GSF+TAPI) - 3\*((GSF+TAPI)-OtherThing) is what you're saying in literal math terms when you say "3 times smaller" which is a useless statement without knowing what the "OtherThing" is.  Ya all the layman here know you mean "one third the size" and this is just another useless rant of me screaming into a pillow but this is EVE.  We're supposed to be the nerds that make all the other nerds look socially functional and normal right?

Alright, end rant.  Go on with the memeing.

Excavs are tanky as shit and the Rorqual has bonuses to RSBs and shield links. Use them.

&gt;Heavy water is another cost, deduct that too.

HW is a really insignificant cost, all things considered. An hour of mining is less than 4Mn ISK.
---
&gt;Lose 2.5bil in drones from someone who spends 10 seconds of effort

How terrible is your Drone Durability skill that it takes ten seconds to kill your Excavs? Do you have them mine a rock 10k away? Do you not fit shield links and RSBs? Do you do *anything* to keep your poor drones alive?

I recognize the dscan lol
---
I mean, unless you're several km off the rock you're mining or you're mining those 16km-wide veldspar rocks (and good lord are those huge), you should be able to pull drones before they get nuked. It also helps to fit T2 shield links and use a mindlink, the 38% bonus to shield capacity is nothing to sneeze at. That's not to say your drones will be invincible, it's just that most of the time I see people getting their drones nuked it's when they're doing stupid shit like sitting 5k off their rock.

It's a risk for sure, but you can totally do it as a newbie. Helps to know how to set a deadspace drop while scanning (warp to something, save a position while on route, then warp to that position in the middle of nowhere. Means nasties at least have to spend some time scanning you down)

I can get the point that having to individually wardec everyone on the opposing side can be an expensive PITA. It would make sense for everyone, attackers+allies and defenders+allies, to be all at war with each other at the same time and not have this issue where you're at war with these guys but not those guys but those guys can help these guys you're at war with.

If they just want to shoot stuff, then they shouldn't make diplomatic agreements.

They gave their word, and it says a lot about the type of person someone is in real life if they can't keep their word. That is the issue at hand.
---
I watched a video where someone was doing that and said it's the best way to avoid someone chasing you down. I'm still scared to loose another ship so soon since I just replaced my venture after it blew up today. I will attempt to give it a try though :)

I hope they release some lore background saying the triangles be messin' with our chat.

Learn to stay off the beaten path and you'll be fine. Learn the [topology of New Eden](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Topology) and be prepared to avoid entrances to low-sec that are close to the main ring route. Learn what systems are routinely in the ["most violent" list](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map) and avoid those (unless you're looking for a fight). Beware of jumping into [low-sec islands](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Lonetrek/Aunenen#sec) in high-sec unless you have a plan for evading a camp, or at least have checked recent statistics for the system. If you're not an alpha, train Cloaking III and practice the [cloak trick](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Cloak_Trick). If you *are* an alpha, at least have a travel fit to get you where you're going: MWD (for crashing the gate back the way you came) or WCS (as many as you have low slots, probably) to try to bull it through the way you planned to go. Neither will help you if you're too slow for the amount of DPS the camp can dish out, so be prepared to lose ships.

Or you can run with tdf and not warp to to tpph

[This article](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Mission_Hubs) is old and confusing but offers a way to determine how to choose a hub based on proximity of storyline agents to mission agents.

One I was on a exploration roam and had a few bowls, flew into a gate camp, dropped some x-instent and crashed the gate, got out, made a new route and went through the same gate, I was very confused, but managed to crash again, rerouted again, and somehow jumped the same gate a third time, did not make it, RIP my first Astero.

Fountain was paid back in wwb.  That account sheet is balance neutral.  Where is the payback for Vale?  Where is the payback for the year you all spent in catch?  Where is the payback for the attempted eviction that ended at UALX?

We are square with goons, you all still got debts that you owe though.

ya, i was just stating a fact, i didn't think snuff had any responsibility to "not drop" on them because of FEI

I feel like Black Desert has a good way with the family names! PA PLS

Ok

Having a long chat with people in a different region to me is pretty cool though.

You don't need a "policy" to be dickheads

No you

Wormholes are great!

oof  I have a family man, people cared about me bro
---
So long as you all are in the grave first we will view that as a win for us.
---
My next alt actually is going to you guys for those contests.
---
Can't lose the contest if you're playing both sides :4head: /s

Really though I probably will so there's always some group running

I don't know if this is is a shitpost or shit post, but it's beautiful

Broadcasting is bannable but running multiple clients isn't so long as they are all omega (premium)

&gt; My tiny ship with junk weapons would be destroyed in seconds.
---
Your goal in entering a WH will be to *avoid* violence. You will not even *fit* any weapons at all! 
---
I assume you have some scanning and data-mining (Hacking and Archaeology) skills. Scan down a WH in high-sec, and approach it closely enough to [identify where it leads](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormholes). You want either an entrance to C3 WH space or a WH directly to null-sec. I suggest the latter is better. Once you are in null, you scan for data and/or relic sites, depending on what analyzer(s) you have fitted, and hack and loot the sites. Once you have accumulated a breathtaking, dizzyingly valuable load of loot, start scanning for a WH back to high-sec. Proceed to market hub and cash out, receive bacon.
---
&gt; if these alliances who constantly cry now that they aren't the top dogs put some effort into making their alliances decent places to play the game there wouldn't be such a massive difference in membership numbers.

While it is true, what does it have to do with this thread?

So multiboxing is just running alts now?, sorry I wasn't understanding.
---
Test left Vale on their own accord lol, it was neither attacked nor threatened.
---
You should have heard some of the DEQC guys after they realized it was you, lol. You made some people’s day for sure. o7
---
I specifically named my characters in such a way as to it not be obvious it is my alt. Your idea is bad. You can already add a surname when you create your character, do it that way.
---
Aww sounds like you're a salty poor bastard that can't afford or properly fly a super.  Fuckhead
---
Yeah I see where you're going with that, but I feel like it would only be fair if I could identify the main of someone..
---
Higher surface gravity means that links use more PG and CPU. Depending on how tight your fitting space is this could be an issue. Less than 11 m/s\^2 surface gravity is usually fine.
---
The question is whether or not geography is in and of itself a desirable end goal.  I believe that clusters of systems are mildly interesting, yet oddly disgusting in the context of Fozzie sov.  Whether these clusters of important systems move according to a fixed or player-driven pattern is really the only thing to get hung up about with respect to front line vs no front line.  I'm not convinced that there's any advantage to a fixed pattern.  Also, highly upgraded systems are part of the faction warfare carrot.  Making them move with the systems that are being contested is logistically annoying.  The fixed pattern of related systems in a frontline system is not a necessary model to make the behaviors you're after become coherent as one integrated design.
---
If you want loot from citadels do what others do, wormhole evictions you  sorry excuse of a human
---
I see this all the time as a recruiter lol. "This 750k SP indy pilot is my main." "No, that 65mil SP subcap specialist with Cyno V is your main." "But, but, but"
---
I’ve soloed a super in my super thanks. Bump tackled it and neuted it after it jumped in to a cyno. I sold it and he toon tho. I have a killmail link if you are interested.
---
These are the worst developers I've ever seen at the hands of the greatest game ever. Complete morons
---
Horde octopus can hold many strings
---
As a fellow recruiter I feel you :/
---
After quitting and restarting last year for some time i had a cap alt with more sp than my "main" lmao
---
I too am learning the art of the arty loki. You probably can take an ishtar, as long as you're careful and web its drones if they get close to you. Your own drones should be able to whittle them down. I had this experience with a Gila, and the Gila popped before I did.
---
They were given a list of characters and alts after the eviction as well if they wanted to clean house of spies. They chose not to.
---
It Just Works
---
in game !
---
Well, at least this guy actually plays Eve and can share this, unlike 90% of the reeeee crowd here
---
We still use local in this game? I thought there is no place for a local?
---
I think lowsec and highsec dudes should stop complaining about no local. 
---
There is no reason to have one!
---
😆
---
You and 3 others liked this
---
That's all you got, one day from a self inflicted fuck up?
---
For what do you want a local? Trust me it‘s useless. You can close the local window and go on playing!
---
Would be funny to take you to a drifter colosseum where everyone across eve can fight to the death. And there's no exit and no escape except to self destruct out of there. Like abyssal pvp, but nobody wins.
---
Quick Q,
---
&gt; should try not being content killers on the regular and provide good fights more often to roamers?
---
Why would anyone want to do this?
---
FW is *much* better in a player corp, where you can get some help hauling your stuff to low and actually living there. The fights are a lot more survivable when there are blues in system to help you out, and you can get some pointers on how to kill people from your mates. The "living there" part is important too... being able to quickly grab another ship and get back into the fight is *much* better than limping back to high-sec in a pod.
---
That's gonna be a pretty large cost to entry, and is also quite difficult.
---
Ummm, no.
---
It’s always relevant
---
Oh I just saw other ppl commenting about gotg so said what I think about gotg
---
What a [laughable](https://zkillboard.com/kill/57770276/) untrue [assertion](https://zkillboard.com/kill/57770204/).
---
Those totally werent pl toaster rorqs that got killed because they didn't realize we put a jammer up behind them and the t3c rescue fleet got waterboarded.
---
Go peddle your bullshit elsewhere son.
---
Every ship has the same issue, killmarks are terribly implemented.
---
Haha these videos are real fights. Go out and you'll find people veing bad at pvp.
---
No one in panfam wants tapi as allies
---
The 'gotcha' statement is that you are not adapting. Break up into splinter fleets and attack multiple locations. Roam in teams. Take Thera holes to fun new locations and kill new people. The sun has set and the herds and flocks are trying to hide in their barns of supercap safety. Now is the time of the wolf, foxes, and weasels of roaming gangs. Are you going to be penned or are you going to hunt. Eve changes with our without you.
---
How do you constantly get it wrong?
---
Is this an actual question? Why would anyone want to provide good fights to roamers? 
---
Well for one, in hopes that roamers will continue to come to your space and provide learning opportunities/fights/chances for new FCs to try things/old FCs to try new things. But that's the difference between PanFam and Goonswarm, at it's core, isn't it? PanFam is a PVP Alliance that does PvE, so they **WANT** people coming to their space, because their "content" is having fights and killing people. Contrast that with the reason why Goonswarm is so much bigger than every other alliance, because it's "the place to be" if you want dank ticks and/or safe ratting/mining. Which is why they have no issue putting Titans on all your exit gates and camping you in.
---
Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're asking, but it seems like you're saying "Why would anyone want to fight in Eve", and I'm not really sure how to answer that other than "Because that's why a lot of people log in every day? That's the 'content' they enjoy in the game?"
---
The only thin "main" means for us is what shows up in discord/mumble/forums.
---
Yeah that's right, as long as you arnt using external software to input broadcast you're fine
---
The whole thing with eve is anyone can be whoever they want, one character you can be mates and their other alt might be trolling the $#@t out of you. If you could tell everyone's characters that wouldn't make eve, eve! And that's not even taking into account some ppl sell their characters on bazaar, it would be too hard for someone to track unless people are volunteering all their data. You would have sold characters still under your 'alts and could be a bad look depending what the new owner is using that character for. Sorry but I think it's best to leave eve a cold and scary place, more fun that way and if someone wants you to know all their alts, they would just tell you.
---
I'm not, though. You have to be a serious bitch boy to give even half a shit about what a group calls themselves, let alone to hold water for *actual years* over it.
---
Yet they still won that war and took all the sov? Makes you think
---
Not my fault if you highsec people are predictable !
---
But yeah, depending what his ship was, he might not have wanted to gank a Rattlesnake in highsec. Be careful not to be caught by him and his friends for round two.
---
We do shoot Test, that is because we are neutral to them. We do not shoot Init because our word is our bond. I understand that yours isn't, but we value our reputation of not breaking treaties.
---
sometimes you find the content; sometimes you are the content.  I'm just pleased there was content.
---
To each their own definition of what is or is not engaging
---
Yup. Lots of ways to game this.
---
He said, while having all of his assets in an NPC station. Potentially even Jita.
---
they had so much success with the null black out theyre testing it again in highsec
---
Nice!
---
If you make it more dangerous it isn’t going to make one group have all the supers. It’s been dangerous to have supers this whole time. The idea is to make it so keepstars can’t be just a safe haven for them and so you need to be active or u need to log out in space. Make supers have to move around. Moving them around promotes content. Allows ppl opportunities to destroy them and camp them. Gets people in space. Let’s the enemies set up counter drops. Ever rapecaged a pos to kill the super inside? That doesn’t happen in keepstars. It’s safety. The lack of ability to pull off these big heists and giving your small alliance a purpose other than F1 and anchor on FC or entosis for the big blue donut is one reason why a lot of pvpers left the game. When crabs lose sov they just fold into another big donut and go back to krabbing. F1 and anchor isn’t all the pvpers want to do. Giving us goals like rapecaging poses and mechanics are good for the economy as well. A lot of players need a reason to log in and do shitty timers. Killing that structure late at night... no one wants to do it. It’s not rewarding enough. If killing structures was more rewarding you’d probably see more big wars and an actual significant conflict again.

Did you fetchez la vache?
---
You really gonna bitch about batphoning? In a null Bloc?
---
This is hilarious. Hilmar is just taking a piss now.
---
Who cares about Panfam or any coalition for that matter? It's about content. Goons completely owning the place is just boring content that stalls the game and causes players to leave. 
---
If TAPI wants to be part of that problem then that's just their stupidness. Nobody cares about who likes who or who's "winning Eve", lol.
---
why do people try to hide the truth
---
Good retort, well thought out.
---
EvilHuntz please..

no..people are that retarded

Spodbless evicting goons

Been there, got old fast.

If you're legit interested, look up running [3/10](http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=Guristas_Guerilla_Grounds) and [4/10](http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=Guristas_Scout_Outpost) DED sites in highsec to get started with combat exploration. 4/10s look like they have a [chance of escalating from the refuge anomolies](http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=Guristas_Refuge) and they have a chance at dropping 250 million worth in loot. And the sites are really easy if you bring the largest ship that you can into them (cruiser for 3/10 and battlecruiser for 4/10).
---
If I were to live in highsec and really wanted to turn out money solo, combat exploration is how I would do it. Later on, as you get more advanced, you can start looking into lowsec ded sites (like 5/10 and 6/10), but you generally will want a battleship (hard to move without becoming an explosion in lowsec tho) or a tech 3 cruiser (perfect for this application) for these.
---
removing vast swathes of content is never a good thing, adapting by just accepting it's inferior form is dumb. The content you think you are finding was there all along now it's the only thing left
---
Why should I believe thats WH space when you blacked out every indicator there is that its a WH?
---
Neither can this shit op but here were are huh
---
Same same
---
:( let's just keep bishing or talking about how awesome the blackout is, we don't need more surprises when we log on tomorrow.
---
Hmmm yes let's compare a 300m Kiki to a 2m Algos. Kiki wins plz nerf.
---
For real. Several of my accounts are close in SP and have variations of the same name. Who the fuck knows anymore?

“We need to make another update to the chat server”

“Will it be smooth of...”

---
-ccp meeting somewhere
---
you guys need a tall_sting equivalent but damned if I can think of what it'd be without resorting to something obscene
---
You are wrong on every point you just made.
---
No. Killing the FC is a valid and effective tactic. Tbh I hate that the Monitor exists. I haven’t seen it used much but its for the most part a ship thats immune to being killed in most fights. If your entire fleet depends on one person and if that person dies your whole fleet doesn’t work, you shouldn’t be a fleet. This leads to F1 monkey filled fleets where only one or a few people actually need to be smart
---
How would darkness know anything about massive fleets
---
I bought a character with more SP than my main.
---
The only thing identifiable about my.main compared to my other characters is my main is super negative sec.
---
It can't both be bots don't log in and more bots than ever before log in and die, is it you or hilmar who's trying to fool me
---
Because you would screw over the person with 1 rorqual more than the guy with a bunch because that 1 person will be heavily penalized for someone elses’s choice In mining in the same anom as them.
---
Were they contested?
---
The chaos era is justification for not being able to fix that trainwreck.  IRC been running bullshit free(technology wise) for 30+years now.
---
Why would that be fair?
---
Why would knowing the main benefit you at all compared to how much it hurts what eve is?
---
I have enough isk to easily replace any losses up to and including dead space fits and hg pods. Once you hit 20b or so you'll probably have a hard time keeping yourself from trying out dumb but fun stuff that has a rather small chance of succeeding.
---
It's been working fine for how long until today?
---
So you are completely wrong on this. Shield boosts do not affect drones. Also bombs fly very fast, if you don’t pull the literally right away, you will lose a few if not all of them.
---
To be fair, large fights have been preforming better than ever.
---
It took me a month to get 100 mil worth when I started. And that's after moving to null and belt ratting in a thrasher for 2 weeks straight. He's doing fucking fine for 15 days in.
---
Your surprised? The blackout seemed to be going to smoothly, something had to happen.
---
Tell me that again when you're not a literal teenager whose played this game no longer than I've owned a kestrel and I might take you seriously.
---
For the record I like you personally, I'm obviously not going to tell you who I am, but I find you as a person enjoyable. I think you're a little inexperienced and a bit reckless because of your desire to prove that you know more than you do, but I still like you. But that doesn't mean you're going to win an argument with me.
---
Wow, all I do is solo PvP every time I log in. Never have I seen this much stupidity.
---
&gt; in hopes that roamers will continue to come to your space and provide learning opportunities/fights/chances for new FCs to try things/old FCs to try new things.
---
I can't go do this in someone else's space?
---
&gt; PanFam is a PVP Alliance that does PvE, so they WANT people coming to their space, because their "content"
---
You're not lying about being new are you.
---
&gt; "Why would anyone want to fight in Eve"
---
No, why would I want roamers in my space when I can smash them out, continue to reap the benefits of my secure space while going and killing them in theirs instead.
---
As a space landlord roamers provide me no benefit.
---
Hahaha wheover you are. I like your attitude.   
---
Cool guy
---
What time zone, what you fly with, and who you fly with? Cause our defence roam hasnt been getting no where the fights we had pre-blackout
---
I feel like you guys don’t understand rorqual pilots. Most people have 2-4 pilots, some a few more but not many people have more than 10. There was 1 guy with 56 rorquals and he got banned after the ticket brigading from salty PL boys. No one else in imperium has even near that many rorquals. As it’s a fucking pain to man that many.
---
Every one spam local with: Why can't we be friends!
---
Check out Delonewolf on YouTube. He runs a lot of high sec pve content that sounds like it might be up your alley
---
I do agree with you, but I bet the owners of nearly 2k lost excavators last month also agreed with you at one point as well.
---
Who needs chaos from CCP mandated events when CCP programming creates enough chaos.

It's pretty challenging from what I've heard but you get good fights out of it. Takes a while to get to the skill level required in terms of your personal player skill then also for the training. But, could be something for you to aim towards in the distant future.
---
Yeah these totally weren't bait lmao. At least one of the pilot names should give you a hint. 
---
Face it, you inserted yourself into a war that wasn't yours and then turned your tail and ran to the other side of the map when CO2 lost Tribute because of what the big bad panfam *might* do. What a fucking joke.
---
Asherothi runs great trig incursion fleets. If you can get into a praxis, I would try those.
---
You killed my killmark retri D:
---
Shutup seth, you don't love me anymore.
---
Been playing for a week and I’m terrified of this happening. I got jumped once when I tried to be bold and go into low sec for a level 2 mission, the guys were cool and never podded me tho!
---
What happens if they had tho? Surely you don’t have to start from scratch
---
Does a rorq with t2s still beat exhumers?
---
What numbers.
---
Keep coming up with ideas like this and I'll let you fuck my sister.
---
https://timerboard.net/Fraternity
---
show up to one and contest it. these are open timers, they will form or they will lose.
---
Covetors are the better investment
---
You dont need to know that. You can try to formulate some rationale for it but at the end of the day it's no ones fucking business who owns what unless they're using your credit card.
---
My question was were any of these RF timers contested?
---
The previous guy is just retarded and salty
---
Imagine living with the mindset that those who have organized and built an empire and have been more successful than you at this sandbox game are actually wrong so you must hurf and blurf on Reddit non-stop about ways to change the game to make their gameplay more like yours because their success and organization has made isk-generation and other activities within their empires "too safe".
---
Not much analysis.
---
But here's an anecdote.
---
Yesterday, I was doing the Skilling spree on my pain who is deep negative sec, so I can't use the tutorial.
---
I was out at belts, looking for NPCs. I warp in like 2km from a npc retriever.
---
I had heard these mining groups have reinforcements and thought, "hey, let's try this out" and shoot the retriever.
---
The reinforcement fleet warps in and promptly Fucks my Loki up.
---
So I lost a 700m ship and a level 5 subsystem skill (minmattar offensive) because I made a dumb decision.
---
People only remember the times it doesn't work smh
---
Praise BoB!
---
When you learn how much of Legacy is former NC., Panfam, Provibloc, and N3, because NC. has never been good alliance to its members or good to its allies besides PL.  Then going around space evicting the little guy catches up with you.  Horrible has Goons as their imperialism is like Russia in the cold war just want to solid buffer zone more or less.  Where Panfam is like the West goes into half decent country or slight shithole fucks shit up leaves it a bigger mess and wonder why no one like them or why people would resort to terrorism against them.    Enemies of your own creation.
---
Yet you are the one getting a bit upset that they are calling you the CFC while referring to a time you were called the CFC.
---

---
*trying to find my marshal*
---
They should take you to Jove space where you can't anchor anything, can't dock, and can't get out without dying.
---
Why would you want the game Nicole and diming you all the time?
---
\#youdontpaymysub
---
You’re trying to do some flex about knowing math, but if you did you’d know that looking at multiple different metrics (PCU, MAU, number of rats killed, number of jumps) as a function of multiple variables (events modifying behavior) is just solving a system of equations. 
---
If you were looking at a single metric with no idea about how and to what extent the different events would affect it, you’d be right. But neither of those things are true, and you’re an idiot
---
I don't want the game Nichole and dining me to death. I also am very concerned about any notion of upkeep costs other than the account itself being thought about.
---
And then the hulk gets 2-3 shot by 60 mil isk bombers. The hulks cost 3-400 mil each and take hours to pay yourself back on. Hulks are only useful in high sec just like orcas. An orca in null will die quickly and quietly. Skiffs are tanky but they die just as easily versus bombers who once again only cost 50-70 mil while a skiff will cost 250-400 mil. Bombers ruin the game.
---
like that one time you pod a dude in low and then jump into high
---
HTFU lol
---
good isk in data and relic in c3 and down can even get some pew in the right ship
---
Who are those guys anyway   been there with my friends corp at cobalt edge the first year i played eve but i never seem to understand the area i have never seem them at war or losing sov so far
---
It's extremely challenging but something for you to aim towards later on :)
---
Get out of here with your 'facts' and 'perspective' .... I just wanna grr ccp.
---
Cigar on right hand and  the goon batphone hidden on the left lol
---
Nice talking points.  Lol, yup pefect bait, lets toast a systems Ihub to prep to destroy it and offline a critical jumpbridge route, oh wait, no we got fucked because we were dumb and had a jammer onlined on us, and died.   It was totally bait dude!
---
Also, I would like to note that D-PNP Keepstar will soon have lived longer than P3EN-E or M-0EE8. 
---
I mean really, which organization made the smart choices and did the hard work?   Which organization sat on its laurels and laughed at the dumb miners while they were eclipsed at all levels by the dumb miners?

[The Grasshopper and the Ant](http://www.read.gov/aesop/052.html) dude, its proper that we turn our backs to your begging and allow you to starve.  The world will be better for it.

He stayed for a bit, probably contemplating on what to do. He was about 60km from me as I had heavy rapids and the mission I was doing had a pocket of npcs 90km from me. I hit my MWD, hit around 750 m/s and was going to orbit him to see what he was going to do, but by the time I hit my max speed he warped away 😥
---
Does it matter?
---
Yo take out the kill where I bombed our heretic please
---
Yeah, forgot about those.
---
Gaara was ban for input broadcasting after lighting 50+ cyno at the same time.. And he was not the only one in delve doing that when I was still in goons.
---
From what I remember, in delve only you had at least 1 guy per system (at least) with 15+ rorq which is a fucking lot compare to other people using barge
---
Id like to see all the Precursor ships get a killmark adjustment honestly.. the zarm and rodiva are bad but the others arent much better, all too small
---
Dear Pearl Abyss please sell CCP to Daybreak Game Company so they can revert Eve to its Classic state and fire all these piece of shit devs that blow smoke up people asses and shit.
---
Like 10 seconds. Undock, start tutorial, warp, lock and blap rat. Redock.
---
NU4 Dirty Otter is a Fortizar - the regular kind - not a faction fort.
---
Yes they can. CCP was never referring to player owned structure code. Every part of the game is POS code.
---
Oh I have enough ISK to repace all that shit, don't worry.^^ Almost every investment made is considered lost money to me. I just didn't do much pvp for a long time until I founded a corp and moved to wormholes like 6 months ago.

I play mostly solo as an industry bro. I've gotten into medium t1/t2 module/amunition production, but I don't do any mining besides PI. I look for cheap raw materials; ice, minerals, ore, and the like, in order to manufacture up the production chain as high as I can for profit. Basic business. What I'm wondering is if their is any website or third party apps that will tell me the price of an item, as well, as its relative price given the market price of any and all items that it is an ingredient of. That phrasing might of sucked. The price of an item and it's price if it were inside another item. Ex: The price of tritanium vs the price of tritanium if it were sold as a t1 ship vs the price of tritanium if it were sold as a t2 gun. Am I in over my head here or what?

I feel ya, currently playing on a 10+ year old laptop because my regular laptop that might've been able to record something broke, still waiting for the damn replacement part, but now I spend like half a minute when undocking hoping my client won't crash.

I see why the rorqs were made top tier. Ccp had to do something when the made moons active mining. You pretty much need rorqs to yield the same number of m3 of moon goo as before when towers made it easy. Of course they could make the rocks have more goo per unit so the hulks would be useful. They'd need to do something if they killed the rorqs usefulness.

Hey look I died there! Wasnt actually a tuskers fleet, just a couple of tuskers in it. It was a monster reborn fleet run by the mighty Hab0k himself!
---
Why wouldn't they place their own of 100% of profits
---
Any sufficiently bad design is indistinguishable from a bug.
---
This took longer to get here than I thought it would. Not sure if I'm disappointed in yall or myself for not posting it
---
But this will ruin the game for scammers! How will they be able to spam their scams?

I HATE THAT GUY 😡
---
Post with your main
---
Cant tell if you are serious or retarded. Or a very good combination of seriously retarded.
---
&gt; remember when pl deployed with tri, volta, skillu, and everyone else to fight tapi and gotg stayed in deklein, peacefully krabbing?
---
More pandafam lies. GotG was there as [UALX](https://br.inyour.space/?s=4807&amp;b=8176440&amp;e=437&amp;t=qvrffaueab) , the only fight of that war.

This is why your coalition will fail. You treat your allies like shit and lie about it.
---
It's a shitty shit post while shitting.
---
Compressing your ore helps a ton, too
---
Yeah no. That's not what I meant.
---
Most people will fuck off to gather intel before deciding whether to stay or not. Including whoever you're calling elite PvPers. The 10% that don't are purposely looking to end their roam or because they're close to the ratter kill and want to risk it.
---
do you know whats funny? that youre so blinded by your hate for someone who you \*think\* is in an enemy faction (in a videogame) that you ignore blatantly obvious facts. There were a lot of things PL did with rorqs. unironic toasting wasn't one of them.
---
Well someone had to do it
---
The initial reinforcement doesn't really matter. It's the follow-up timer that counts.
---
I guess we'll see if Frat turns up to defend this. The sheer volume of timers will give them a bit of an edge. Legacy will have to be on point with their shit. Tho at this point I would be putting money on Legacy to win at lost a good portion of those.

CCP cares about RP about as much as they care about FW.
---
umm
---
Recently freed salves rebelling against their old plantation.
---
"must be created to fight with..." I love the poster and effort but I totally was thinking they were going to ally.
---
Everyone probably saw it and thought "if i post that it's gonna be drowned out by the dozen other people posted it." Or at least a man can dream that people were that self aware.
---
Eh, why never mine alone? A few rorqs wouldn't push you off, ever. But yeah shit fit.
---
Not going to lie. This looks pretty fun.
---
I mean, it took longer for the news INIT was moving 2-3t in assets than it did for us to move it. Spies are bad lately.
---
did someone say "chaos"?
---
What war?
---
Pretty sure the game has stuff in place to stop this.
---
They are just circumventing them.
---
I mean without friends... In supers to drop😀. But I'm happy when they do I'm hunting not mining
---
I can talk to people in 1dq from anywhere. What else could I ask for?
---
Monkas he knows
---
Hey guys, I was looking to make a dank meme post for upvotes, but I lost the upvotes. Can you send them again?
---
I think those are way to unstable for anyone to enter
---
lets chuck some spod in there to test this
