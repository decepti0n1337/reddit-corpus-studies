Remove from overview.

Woosh

So this could go both ways depending on how the timer lines up with your schedule as a player. Personally I think that a 12h timer is more likely to go unnoticed. The don't log in for one afternoon and you ahve your kill. This is so circumstansial though. I prefer the pre-change 12h just because it means less effort on the part of the attacker in most cases.
---
In a system with 50 moons you CANNOT have 50 small belts per day. They have a minimum cycle time of like 6 days or so? Sure you could have 50 in 1 day or spread them out however you like, but moons don't create daily belts.

I LOVE THE BOWHEAD \*.\*

---
But now it is gone. And i went down with it. A good captain never leaves the ship ‚ô•
---
Now i am in Utopia, forever.  The dreamland. Although it  is so dark in here, and cold :(
---
And i am all alone, in between the wrecks of my beloved bowhead, unable to escape. Damned to haunt this place forever \*sniff\*

yeah well i go outside and have sex between f1 pushes lol
---
Yes, I am talking about evicted without a fight instead of a fighting with the attacker. The ability to choose your defending days outweights the of extra defensive day. 
---
We have a multi hundred pilot alliance that could easily fight against any size of attack. But after the change I feel the risk of losing everything by simple not being able (work, holidays, etc.) log in my characters on weekdays is too much of an risk to keep defensive ships in the system.
---
Most reasonable adaption to this is just go from defended wormhole into assetless wormhole. Since the defensive fleet is much more expensive that few farming ships which you can just SD on the tether and proceed to log off for 12+ months with the rest of the valuables.
---
Clearly tl;dr for you
---
Calling us colalteral damage is hilarious considering my propsal can be implemented without even touching nullsec.
---
Thank you for the explanation!
---
I have had none of these issues. Still don't love the bookmark changes tho.
---
imagine using ingame chat in TYOOL 2k19.
---
You wormholers really are wild.
---
ccp actually make more money from plex being used in game than a monthly sub
---
Why not? Nobody has a problem with J space timers.
---
I'm pretty sure it's not how you guys did it, but that is exactly what the trail of a perfect tackle would look like.
---
&gt; Azbels get blobbed just because they're an easy 4 billion+ killmail and a raitaru can easily have its timer done by a single guy with three characters. 
---
Adding to this, these changes are even more of an incentive (in case you needed another...) to use multiple Raitarus over one Azbel.
---
Especially with player numbers down, one person can shoot an industry index up pretty high on their own in a single system now.
---
&gt;as op wants too, and wormholers will be happy as well
---
Yea null has the problem, not J space. We blow stuff up perfectly fine
---
Nery nice guy -

&gt;if someone wants to evict you then you're probably getting evicted. In the context of bigger groups
---
There is no context. If some wants to evict you then you're 100% getting evicted full stop

Pester your ISP till they send a tech out and simplify the cabling on your house, make them check signal levels, buy your own modem and a good router/AP and drop thier POS gateway all-in-ones.
---
All the BR is missing is an entosis marauder
---
I know they're botting, but shit's so confusing. We had a branch hole and roamed around the same 15-20 system circle for 4 hours and they just KEPT undocking and ratting in systems we literally just left. We'd have a guy lag behind a jump, we'd leave a system, he'd go into it, and then call "landing on an ishtar" 
---
Are they just really bad? Are their bots that garbage? Are they just not reading intel period?
---
whoever decided, out of all possible choices, to use a format of 2v2 fights with glorified tank and spank fits, needs a stern talking to
---
Make a wormhole corp, make way more money than in K space, roll for nullsec holes, learn to fly nano, and then crap on a solid 80% of players in the game.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
Any decent corp will require third party services. You basically need to be on voice comms to play Eve in a group, and using discord just isn't possible with how big groups get. So, you need to use mumble/TS, and then there needs to be forums for posting communications that are designed to be useful over a long period of time and easy to read when they are old. And then they need a system to auto-kick you from all of those services when you leave the corp. Honestly, a corp not requiring any sort of third party services would be a huge red flag, because without those there's just a pretty big limit on what you can do, and any corp with leadership that's too lazy to set those up probably doesn't have leadership that's going to be active in providing content.
---
Yes that‚Äôs the number one rule I‚Äôve read this far. I can afford to replace the ships I‚Äôve lost. 
---
I equate it to mining stone for an hour just to lose it all to a gunshot in the back of the head when you forgot to check your corners (I come from Rust which is a brutal pvp survival game) 
---
I can roll with the punches.
---
Thank you for your response. 
---
I pay for the games I like, 15 a month won‚Äôt kill me.
---
You are talented as hecc, my dude.  Thanks for posting your art for us to enjoy.  o7
---
Curious: do you paint specific ships for any particular reason, like personal experience with them, or is it just a 'whatever looks right' sort of thing?
---
If you want to stay get integration now. Double training speed is worth a lot
---
Oooooh that ! I saw that video a long time ago, I love that mechanic :D
---
Yes, indeed, why not also bring back all bugs !
---
FYI you start by complaining about N+1 and then suggest nerfing every class into gray oblivion where only N+1 makes a difference anymore.
---
Poor guy actually put some thought into this.
---
He suggests buffing haw damage. I can assure you he did not.
---
I didn‚Äôt say good thought üòè
---
Just wondered why aren‚Äôt that corp make structure holding corp or make another corp to avoid war dec, even though they have not small number.
---
I don't see it that way. As it stands now we have some classes that are fantastic to the point of being the only choice, and other classes that aren't used at all. When did you last see the Deimos get used? I saw Snuffed out use Zealots for some "small" gang fleets, and Eagles are alright. But other than that it's Munnins if you want to get down to business. Black Ops are mostly just glorified buses. It would be nice if there was a reason to actually drop about 100 of them somewhere. Recons could use a buff to damage as well, and probably tank too (100K+ EHP Falcons and Pilgrim cyno droppers aside). Granted the Rook and Curse could use some love, but I didn't get in to all of that because the post was already going long. I've had some thought about what to do about ECM, but I'm not really as solid on that one. ECM is a funny one.
---
Because they want to fight.
---
I guess it kinda depends on what you want to do. If you want to build the next bloc from a core of 6 dudes starting from scratch 16 years in, good luck. I would look into planting roots in NPC null, or looking into "sov trolling".
---
And update all the same would be great.
---
Yeah, no. Some wormhole groups have adults who do shit IRL on weekends.
---
You said that like it was something managed by CCP
---
Thumbs up for shooting wrecks.
---
Do you understand what a pirate is?
---
Not that big news
---
Why do Chinese need so many words said from different people to say "irrelevant information"?!
---
So actually, this is already implemented in Eve Echoes- the mobile game
---
when this happened all the truth are baned.my account was baned in ten days in the Chinese eve BBS.the administrator of Chinese eve BBS is RR 's CEO.domityphoon(Â§öÁ±≥Âè∞È£éÔºâ.all the news are delete.
---
&gt;Oracle (Battlecruiser, but it can be done).
---
Oracle is actually the most common dps ship in nano gang. Also pulses beat beams on oracles. The whole idea of nano is to have anti tackle screening off tackle. If you're way way behind your anti tackle you'll just get jumped on and eaten
---
Go for it when you feel like you need it. Alpha is meant to be like an extended trial. Just don't try to grind plex for your sub, it'll kill the enjoyment.
---
Happy hunting :)
---
https://tieba.baidu.com/f?kw=eve%E6%AC%A7%E6%9C%8D&amp;fr=index
---
Nano is good because it isnt just raw speed. Lots of times in nano you'll be changing directions constantly to get in and out of range of shit. Being able to accelerate quickly is important
---
I understand what you're saying by "types" but just to be clear you cant actually have different types in the same group. You cant put rep drones in the same group as damage drones. You can have different drones of the same type in the same group though.
---
can we get a recap (even just google translated) of whats happened?
---
Lets not forget supers decloaking 200km off a large in pyne once youve engaged someone
---
i want a button to click, instead of a shortcut.
---
Uhm... that's exactly where we are?
---
Winning eve for the moment, but was happy to be in Horde. Might again. My only quibble was not having any SiGs devoted to small gang stuff while I was a member.  Made it a little harder to make friends when the main interaction was 50+ person fleets. Mining fleets kinda being the exception, but everybody was semi-afk and watching netflix etc. Plus, I‚Äôm just personally totally uninterested in shooting rocks. Everybody I talked to was pretty friendly.
---
Social ratting as in Incursions or Invasions?
---
Yea, you can also set launch default group, return to bay, and return and orbit to shortcuts.
---
Drone boat plot BTW.
---
Stop. I can only get so erect.  It's starting to hurt...
---
And then you wonder why these Chinese alliances get to become a super power that fast while TEST, PL, NC., goons took several years to become what they are now.
---
Dont think init is going for the cash. Panfam is a natural ennemy for us, since a long long time (when some former panfam corp were in BOB for example).
---
It s just another story to shoot panfam. Nothing more. If it were someone else who gonna kill RR, for sure we let them die ;)
---
Consistent is always iffy.
---
But one thing you should try is being the one making the content instead of simply waiting for someone else to make it for you.
---
...yes
---
Set destination, turn on autopilot.

CCP need to sort the obvious RMT out....

Why does this read like Chinese propaganda?

(You might be totally honest, I just don't see the point of making that post beside sucking kneecaps and for recruitment purposes).
---
&gt; and you can get from 0 skills total to Minmatar Battleship III in... 2 weeks
---
More like 3 days
---
Actually a decent point. Unfortunately the low power changes are the least concerning thing here.
---
commissions are clients choice but for my personal work its a combination of factors that filter down to what i feel looks right i think
---
well shit i blame CCP for this.          
---
I already told once on company meeting "that it will still not happen due to ISK cost"
---
Bing bing bing bong bing
---
I suggested this years ago. Also adding the ability to drop your preferred broadcasts to the button bar too.
---
Aye, the game would get stale if you didn‚Äôt have an enemy to shoot at. Just remember it‚Äôs nothing personal. We are there to be the opposing team.  Get on fleets give it your best shot and have fun.
---

---
These four supers belong to the same corp beidaxiyabggongyuezuzhi, which was revealed as an RMT Corp on reddit a few days ago. It seems that those stupid fits prove that in a way.
---
As much as hole control sucks for both sides (no arguments there) it's a necessary evil. Anyone and everyone could third party on evictions if hole control was not effective. Which sounds fun until I remind you that this includes kspace groups who are bored one evening and fancy a wspace turkey shoot. That would be as bad for the defenders as it is for the attackers.
---
Right now hole control severely limits the number of people who can get in. But due to the nature of rage rolling and null sec statics, perfect hole control in a C5/6 or a null / low static hole is impossible. Defenders will always get people in if they commit hard enough, which we can agree is a good thing. With highsec statics, perfect hole control is possible but requires constant vigilance of a near-impossible level. The losers here are C4 space. The attackers have double the number of statics to control, but otherwise C4 space definitely gets the short straw when it comes to circumventing hole control.
---
I suggest come to Karmafleet. We treat people nice and all of that and we actively hunt enemies coming into our space.
---
By it's very nature small gang doesn't need a sig. Ask in chat and get a few bodies and go small gang. The small gang was shut down for that reason.
---
that's the best way to implement it but if I have 2 different drones in a group what will you put as icon ? eg 2 geckos &amp; a standard heavy ?
---
Yup. Tackle decloak Loki and pop. Super annoying.
---
Have you tried being in the standing fleet? We do stupid small-gang stuff all the time. Most of the time it either ends with us mega-feeding or turbo blobbing with varied kitchen sink comp.
---
Also, there are people who ping for nanogang roams to low sec all the time. We have like 5-10 people in those fleets and they are fun.
---
You forgot about the bonus LP.
---
Go mine in your locust fleet.
---
Don‚Äôt you have another FC to kick out ?
---
The dream of playing this game as Omega for free? Yeah, most of us have been there. Then we realized that there are other goals.

For sure rr are doing shit rmt... like panfam renters / frt / north pet.

ALL major null alliances and coalitions support bots.  It's so funny when they all point the fingers at others when everyone's hands are bloody.  Burn null.  Burn the bots.  No mercy.  Chaos era forever.
---
While the module still exists, its nearly worthless against most subcaps nowadays, so what you see in that video isnt possible anymore. I do agree that Goomswarm would probably be a good fit. You have to have a thick skin though. 
---
We always have a standing defense fleet (though normally it doesnt come to aid of a procurer) but will hunt fleets roaming around our home region of Delve. We can also help you into a supercarrier offering (probably) the cheapest hulls in eve (like seriously) and giving you a list of skills needed for flying em. 
---
One thing to be prepared for, people "hate" us. 
---
Oh, and highsec is full of people at war with us. Check out Karmafleet, Goonwaffe or ascee for megacorps, or try your hand at the smaller ones for a tighter knit group.
---
Pls no
---
I have seen the same videos the behaviour of some of these bots is spookily similar. Some bots even identify player ships and will instantly lock them and send drones/fighters at them. I tackled a bunch of blantent VNI bots a while ago and they kept fragging my tackle alt as it landed on grid, had to set up a bubble off the POS and wait 5 mins for them to land in it and log in my carrier on top of them to actually catch them
---
Super noob, what‚Äôs Rmt?
---
There was 30 other hels that died at his side. That is about 4 dreads per super. With your school of thought those supers had a very good chance of winning that engagement. They all died in an absolute fire and not a single one absorbed more than 6 million damage, never mind the 60 million you claim to have in pyfa with your max links phenomenon generator high grade slaves etc etc etc. On paper is very different from in practice
---
How do you feel about the ability to turn off citadel services via entosis link, like the old station services?
---
By having a thick skin what do you mean? Like verbal abuse or verbal banter plus corrections when I did something  wrong? I can handle constructive criticism and I can hold my own in playful shit talking but I dont do well with uncalled for verbal abuse.
---
Lmao nice. I was wondering if that's why I was getting down voted. Fuck ratting.
---
players FOB. CcPlS
---
Playful banter. We wont outright beat ya down. We are actually quite nice.
---
I've always liked this idea for nullsec. But I think being able to disable services mid wormhole eviction would be way too powerful. You could make wormhole structures immune to toasters, or somehow tie being able to toast structures to sov? But I couldn't think of a clean way to implement it so I did not include it here.
---
Not saying that is the worst thing of bot behaviour then. But even though i am absolutely against botting in every possible way, these bots at least fight, which means they obviously don't warp out and you can kill them. Which on the other side makes it by that point actually really hard to determine if thats a bot or a player, since that is behaviour you would probably expect by a player. I forsee dark times in our future :(
---
Sooooo, lets nerf the stratios drone bay so you can only fit 3 different types? Perfect *CCP takes note
---
I read the latest patchnotes a couple of days ago, now i feel sick.
---
I think I'd fit right in then. My only issue is like I stated I'm literally down to my last 60m so I cant afford to do much if anything once I get there. What is your recommendation for me to effectively jump in and start making money and throwing hands with the boys who wanna trespass?
---
I just use a key pad for my left hand 1&amp;2 are guns, 3 launch drones 4 engage target, 10 return,  this leaves my right hand free to use the mouse.
---
How do you catch botters like that? Surely you guys don't just jump through the wormhole and hope for the best. Or was it the broken local yesterday that enabled this in the first place?
---
On this occasion i want to declare that all that all those Sansha modules were acquired in an illegal way and people using this stolen equipment will be dealt in a 'proper' way.
---
Honestly, the 2 cheapest ways to make isk are eithering salvaging behind a super (havens pay around 10m in salvage per site) or ratting in a myrmidan (however you spell that) but thats like 70-80m to fit.
---
Faster anchoring on citadels would be OP. But we definitely need something fast anchoring for POS parity. Low HP structure, 1 ref timer, no defenses. Something like that.
---
Fair point, I didn't consider the impact of it mid-eviction. Most of my experience with it was in nullsec as WH space never had stations to begin with; as such, I think it's worthwhile if it's only in k-space. It lead to a lot of great, spontaneous fights especially when roaming.
---
As for a clean way to implement, you could just make the entosis link not be able to activate in j-space, just like you can't drop a TCU or IHub. Not sure how much of a nightmare it would be code-wise but it seems like the structure is already there (and maybe a simple boolean value?)
---
GMT +3 is Moscow time which is in theory RU standard.
---
That puts them a lot closer to EU and Asia.
---
I can sit in a noctis, I'd gladly do that to make some isk. Would I be supplied with one and able to pay it back with the isk I earned from scrapping or would I need to find a way to buy one first?
---
Huh.  That's exactly what eve echos does in their UI.
---
Provide the evidence that they're doing the same thing and we'll publicly shame them and report them to CCP just like RR here.
---
You keep trying to deflect even with your last reply. You understand you are part of the problem of why this continues yes?
---
Why do I often find abandoned rookie ships on gates in high sec?
---
I cant really say on that. We are a giant alliance. Some of us might help ya out, others might expect you to make your own way.
---
Like you said previously said, with each iteration AI gets smarter, with each bot caught and kill/banned the programmer adds new ways to be undetectable; adding pvp features, refitting, random mouse movements and click delays, purposefully making mistakes to disguise the bot. It's some clever shit.
---
lol
---
(You might be totally honest, I just don't see the point of making that post beside sucking kneecaps for the enemies of horde).

Anything that shows up as a Combat Probe (or worse Sister's Combat Probe) is a general warning of GTFO now - because someone is openly hunting in that hole. Not your Core scanning probe, but the Combat Probes.
---
Ok understood.
---
I use Spotify for driving music and occasionally for work. Gonna be slotting these into my play list for sure. I'm hoping the symphony makes it on soon as well.
---
(I have no idea about echoes, so I have no clue what it possible there)
---
A lot is about managing the fight. Engage only enemies you can deal with, fit your ship correctly, anticipate the fit your opponent brings, don't get caught in a bad spot, will there be backup? etc.
---
For brawling, it's often pretty simple once the fight started - make sure you're firing and repping, and manage your distance. For kiting, the actual fight involves a lot more of positioning, manual piloting, avoiding slighshots and managing ranges and transversal.
---
Once there are more ships involved in the fight, the positioning on grid (are there possible warpins? what ships are on grid? what's on D-Scan etc.) is pretty important, too. So, at first glance there's not that much to do, but there is quite a lot of gameplay emerging from what you can do.
---
If that's enough for you or fits your taste - only you can know. I'd say it's less learning 50+ unique abilities of characters in games like Wow or some Moba, but to understand what the combinations of the ships/weapons/ewars make possible.
---
There backed by GSF/TEST so not really.
---
Shit i should be rich, going to need to check my alt to see if the gobloons went there by mistake.
---
how the hell did they not hull tank the brutix!
---
A lot of understandable questions. You're correct that a lot of what determines a fight will begin at the fitting screen but not all. There's also the decision making of what/who you engage and where. Are you willing to risk getting ganged up on for a chance at honorable 1v1? Or are you specifically looking to profit off your kills?
---
Lastly, there can be quite a bit of skill in actual combat. If you have larger ships there can be many active modules that require timing and/or efficiency to win. Manual piloting is almost always a big benefit when done well. All this while checking local/intel channels (if needed)/d-scan for possible enemy back up or escalation.
---
I definitely think eve combat, specifically pvp, is more complex and enjoyable then your initial impressions seem to suggest. But it is not the kind of pvp where you'll be throwing and dodging skill shots or lining up CC chains. Many people still get the shakes from the nervousness and adrenaline of a good fight that are rare in most other games these days. Of course, to each their own.
---
I'd recommend going through some solo pvp videos on youtube, even if a few years old. I doubt you'll get the same feeling as if you were in the situation yourself, but hopefully get a better idea of all the things going on.
---
link br not alliance kb lmao
---
As an adult who works through the week and needs to do stuff on weekends we should just remove timers so i never need to be online ever.
---
Yeh, I can understand that but a random jitter between days seems messy to me. If I know it's a solid timer of 6.5 days I can plan accordingly IRL.
---
It's true that a lot of the pvp in eve happens before the fight. Researching, calculating, simulating fits and damage types vs resistances. However there is still a lot happening in the moment to moment combat that isn't very obvious to a new player. A lot of it is hidden in how you maneuver your ship to increase/decrease range, or manipulate transversal velocity to do more damage (or take less). Eve combat is by design not meant to be twitchy, but that doesn't mean it isn't involved or deep.
---

Hey man you want somewhere pretty cool with people that will rush to your aid at any given time seriously give pandemic horde some thought. They have this exact thing in standing fleet and also more elite high SP allies like PL NC TRI who are for the most part veterans. Horde itself is not really a noob alliance these days anyway but compared to its allies maybe so.
---
Go give it a try, and if you want to be a real bro, when you can, refund the costs of the ships given to you  so you keep good standing with people. Never burn a bridge!

It's not rmt if you take the money but don't give anything ingame. :thinking:

Of course there isn't. There is as much no hate in the comments as there is sense in your post.

there are merits and downsides to both of my preffered solutions. I don't disagree.

I mean, your dumb comment doesn't make sense bro. Supers and Rorquals are not killing the game, there are dozens of them that die daily. The game isn't dying, people are just pretending and crying to CCP for nerfs because they are incompetent fucks that can't hunt or find targets.
---
Sure they should. That is the risk wormholes operate on. That is what attracts and detracts people from it. Dont you think making wormholes safer is the wrong direction? Other wise a lot more people will be moving in and pushing the small guy into k space

I think a change like OP suggests would be impossible with the current legacy code meme, what happens if something occupies the slot with the drone ? if you have a ship that fills up all the slots on your bar some bug would certainly ensue... maybe if a new "drone slots, ctrl f1-f8" bar was made

imagine a large group being incapable of roaming with just a few people, lmao. Sounds awful.
---
It‚Äôs not a bad trade off: pvp on tap, well stocked market, doctrine ships always on contracts at decent prices, good ansi network, ratting grounds, a super umbrella.....
---
Tyfys
---
Overheating drones POG
---
It's a shame you guys have some of the most lethal bombing runs I've seen
---
On serenity botting and rmt was legal iirc, which would make it common. When mangos came over they stated "dont do that anymore", then proceeded to bot and rmt until one of then bought ranger regiment. Now we are here

---
it's not illogical price FFS.
---
It's plurality of  costs over the groups of same power ratings.
---
This comes from the plurality of creation means. If I can mass produce an item for a cheaper time/material cost than another, then I can cut the price of the other item. Nowhere is that illogical. Just because you can't find the logic does not mean there is no logic.
---
What you can often notice, is that the items generated from empire LP store are more expensive than the items from pirat, for the same power. That's because many lp offers require tags and LP that are more difficult to acquire in HS than in LS/NS . Typically a NS mission will provide 80% more LP than an HS mission It's actually from +38% (worst NS vs best HS) to ++200% (best NS vs worst HS).
---
The best example I know of, is the gistum c-type invul vs caldari invul. gistum is better, and sells cheaper.
---
I like that Echoes is a pretty comprehensive Eve experience. But I find that on my iPhone X the UI is a bit crowded and obscures a lot of the screen. I enjoy playing on my iPad Pro with it‚Äôs bigger screen (and battery) much more.
---
I had a G15 blue keyboard when I was still playing Eve.
---
I was using 4 or 6 keys for the drones and groups of guns.
---
I'm now on a G910 Orion Spectrum, it has much fewer macro keys, but I highly recommend one.
---
Honestly don't see the big issue, if people are unable to fuel a citadel they must not care about it very much ( it's not different then the pos mechanics ).
---
when getting salt for fighting out numbered and winning lol 
---
‚ù§Ô∏è for the compliment
---
literally Kill yourself,  you are killing this game
---
IM NOT SPAMMING , PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW HOW SHIT THEY ARE
---
Still not displaying :(
---
On a side note, maybe present the graph with % instead of VP count ? Most people don't know that Plexes and system control work with VP maths.
---
Is this the original tracks from 2003/4¬ø Or did they do a revised music recently?
---
Yyyyyeeeeeeaaaaahhhhhhsssssss!
---
Why have there been multiple posts complaining about how when Goons roam in their space in battlecruisers, they respons with faction battleships and capital ships?
---
What the fuck do you think happens to any roam in Delve?
---
Basically any, if CCP ended up giving money to the Donald Trump reelection campaign there would be just as much headhsaking and consternation just in the other direction.
---
wow
---
One thing I think CCP‚Äôs new-player experience still lacks is directing people to player-run corporations (guilds). It‚Äôs the best way to meet new people, make friends and find mentors to help teach you about the game. 
---
You can find recruitment ads under the Neocom&gt;social&gt;corporations. Once you run some missions and orient yourself for a couple of weeks, reach out to some recruiters.
---
You better stream this progod :)
---
Leaks-RS, i love you. It's a shame that BO-LD is not currently recruiting otherwise i would reach out and pull you into the family.
---
Show me on the rorqual where the BO-LD Loki touched you
---
WE USE EVEN NUMBERS , They HAVE LESS PEOPLE . ITS NOT FUCKEN FAIR
---
vipere fault once again
---
Have fun dude, Horde are good people. 
---
By and large all of the newbie focused corporations are some of the best fun you can have.
---
The fact that there is always new blood around to talk to, teach, etc. keeps the bittervet syndrome away.
---
I got bored and used my ikitursa to clean out all the combat sites in my c2...
---
Stupid spergy idiots.
---
rodger we do have standards lol üòÇüòÇ
---
According to you, people who look the same, share the same view points. Therefor, hiring people who look different  yields multiple view points. Did I get that right?
---
Well, that settles it. You're a troll. I don't need to interact any further.
---
Smells like bait.
---
FUCK OFF , IM NOT YOUR LUNCH
---
The track length on the Spotify version suggests they're the same as the Soundcloud uploads from a few years prior.
---
Imo it's still nice to see them being potentially sorted into albums now though, instead of just one 80-track list without a proper order.
---
I DONT WANT TO BE A PICE OF YOUR FUCKEN SHIT CORP THAT KEEPS FUCKEN KILLING ME
---
We killed three in a medium a couple days ago. But yes the cloaky t3 plague must be dealt with. Give us gate sliding back!
---
Except this isn't giving any money to an election campaign. There's no direct political connection here. But I can understand why you don't actually want to answer the question. 
---
After all, the position of "Women shouldn't make games" is kind of hard to defend.
---
No problem my dude! There‚Äôs so much depth to this game, I‚Äôm still asking questions and learning new things 6 years later.
---
MY RORQAL WOULD KILL YOU IN 2 SECONDS , FUCK OFF
---
That's a funny thing to say when you were dog-piling Frat with TEST not too long ago.
---
you can set favorite a drone group already and key bind launch/attack/return to bay
---
There‚Äôs so much to EVE that I wouldn‚Äôt know where to begin to start explaining how things work. I‚Äôd love to help, just mail me in-game to Dustey Chinguatles. Send me any questions you may have and I‚Äôll be happy to try and answer them for you.
---
Perhaps u lost it to combat?
---
Nah, just curious why you have an objection to it?  Like because it's addictive? Like I literally don't understand.
---
Well, titans arent that much different but they still got buyers.
---
Hello, Kendarr;
---
My name is Arrendis and I run a small group of people who try to keep people from blowing up. You make a lot of good points, but I don't feel any of this is relevant to the fact that I just wanted to say 'hi'.
---
Hi.
---
i'm no expert, but pretty sure gambling addiction is a lot worse
---
I'm gonna wait till you're done playing lumberjack.
---
I can make that happen. Needs a slight donation but its doable. One of our happy donators is Pittsburgh:)
---
EvE Online is rated for teens 13 and older.  Gambling enablement doesn't belong here.  Change the rating and EULA for 18+ would be a start if in fact they want to keep it.  Yes game addiction is also a problem which is why Korean games have an hourly warning.  My main issue is I will not allow my son to play a game with gambling enablement.  Any parent who disagrees has bigger problems.
---
PGL why are you always trying to make money? You tried getting twitch going by game balance debates it didn't happen. Now trying to become the casino kingpin. Just go FC a fleet, create content or something.
---
I can teach you how to steal Excavators. With reduced Excav prices it ain't much, but it's honest work.
---
Ah okies oops ^_^
---
Nah I don't think neural networks are that advanced to meaningfully interact with a complex game system like EVE through a method like OCR and do all the things you say.
---
What is happening is just that the bot developers are learning from experience and creating smarter bots. Maybe you could have some neural network-stuff involved there, for the recognition of on-screen text, but that's about it.
---
The scary thing is that with an advanced enough bot, *it would literally be undetectable*. Variation in click times, doesn't hook into the game files at all (this is how most conventional hacks get detected), randomly making mistakes like a human would, and not even memory sweeping would detect it as you could run the bot program in the host level of a VM with graphics card passthrough, and have the game isolated in its own virtual machine. You could even probably have one central bot 'program' control several VMs with an instance of Eve running on each one.
---
I would imagine that most bots get caught because the creators are lazy and unimaginative or they use bad software. Who's to tell if there are bots out there using this theoretically undetectable software right now?
---
Sky's the limit, developers are smart.
---
Well for blood it would be an archon as they use Amarr hills but would be a cool idea, want me a mini revenant as god knows I‚Äôll never get a normal one
---
Hey Arrendis hope you are well.
---
To establish enough income to whelp whatever i want to. So far it's working pretty well i'm up to being able to whelp 200-300mil ships. Like most recently a Gila i had been yoloing around that managed to get 7 killmarks it was pretty successful and fun. It fittingly met it's timely demise at the hands of another yolo gila.
---
I'm just doing the agent missions in high sec so just used for a while won't use it if I get into the game
---
Gotta double wrap it and smuggle it out in a freighter.
---
Eve has an amazing soundscape. It is gorgeous to listen to.
---
With regards to auto piloting... I would be careful with that, especially when you carry valuable cargo.
---
There are people... you can‚Äôt really blame them... well, you can... they scan down your ship. If they see something they like, they might blow up your ship to get it. It has been known to happen. You won‚Äôt get your ship back when that happens, it is NOT against the rules to blow up your ship.
---
Concord is not going to defend you. Concord is there to deliver justice. Harsh justice, but it won‚Äôt stop someone from blowing up their boat if they‚Äôre doing it right. There are people in fleets who specialise in that kind of business. I‚Äôm serious when I say that, it‚Äôs not an inside joke.
---
Welcome to Eve, buddy.
---
Needs at least one more dictor before it becomes a viable TEST fleet.
---
you forgot to delete this one /u/RonUSMC
---
You will be fine, as long as it doesn't include dictors or whs :)
---
inb4  Treenewbee Ribbons wins it and loses it a couple hours later.
---
I can't fathom shooting POCOs in something that's not a max dps leshak
---
updoot for drone overheating üò©
---
Highsec is still dangerous. Concord isn't there to protect you; they're there to punish wrongdoers.
---
dank my work soundtrack was getting arid
---
Can we please get a hypernet ban?
---
I have  Q: assuming ppl need to hand over items over to you to stream - how does one avoid getting scammed by you if they get their items over to you to auction?
---
I thought you meant it like when people say they got their ship turned into a wreck, or in your case podded
---
I agree these would be things I would like to see It‚Äôs difficult to find a balance between being a literal direct replacement for POS‚Äôs ability to safely eject from a capital and being something that is based around current upwell structures. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to a sort of direct replacement for POS functionality, but I‚Äôm also not hopeful we‚Äôd get that. Tethering would at least allow for capital safelogging.
---
These would be ‚Äúpersonal-sized‚Äù deployables, though, so unless they had a substantial tether radius (which I noticed you asked to be reduced on some existing upwell structures above), you could probably still bubble-cage them.
---
If I had 7 bil in liquid ISK I'd so be in.
---
This is just utter bullshit. The people who push this "diversity" nonsense are religious fanatics who will fiercely try to suppress any and all opinions contracting their own. They will push their retarded politics and try to enforce their feelings as the ultimate moral authority regardless of fact and objective reality.
---
The soundcloud list were NOT the originals. I have the full original collection on my system.
---
I here you man granted i dont mind those types of videos their are some absolute crackers with just music/no commentary. The one about blops comes to mind i believe it was called trama was so good :)
---
e
---
You still have a shitty mentality, like the rest of VOLTA. Your main problem in this fucking alliance is that you hold people that use Rorquals as EVE's cancer, yet, that same cancer is providing you content.
---
Rorquals aren't an abuse, the lack of ships dying is an issue. And as always, you are pretty silent about something that is supposedly broken while you use it, and get pretty vocal once you don't. I didn't hear you bitch back in Darkness with your 3 or 4 chars, saying Rorquals were broken shit when I saved your sorry ass with Darkness' defense fleet. You didn't bitch about being clocked with a trash industrial ship next to an NPC citadel when it was broken, but now that it's fixed you are all vocal about it.
---
You're just a big hypocrite my man, that's the thing.
---
So... Prioritize the guy playing for 10 minutes who hasn't had any time to get accustom to the way things look over the players who have been paying to play your game for 10 years... I understand the thinking of, we need new players to survive... But new players are going to always be overwhelmed changing the bars like this is not going to help with that.  But it does mess with every player who actually is paying to play the game and probably 95% of which read left to right.
---
may i suggest wormholes as a content creation source?
---
Okay I‚Äôll check that out, sounds lucrative. 
---
Been ratting with my Corax and relic/data sites in a Huron. I‚Äôm Caldari. I do have a play Corp, and everyone is chill so far. We just operate so far out the way, it‚Äôs kind of a pain sometimes.
---
Dude i have literally no excuse live like an  hour away but most likely will not go i am such a hermit xD
---
My corpmate undocked a retrobution and had fighter pods, while still in his retribution
---
I cant help that you make me laugh. I just express myself a bit better than you without sounding like a premature 6th grader. Enjoy the post bro. Oh and lol.
---
Noted thank you!
---
didn't bluemelon already scam PL for several trillion?
---
Bobspeed
---
Sweet! DM me your character name and I will say hi when I see you in game!
---
what exactly should i know? i\`ve done lots of t5s on gila so i know default priority. But i\`ve never played hawks and thats why i\`m asking
---
We have like a team of 6 that had some Germans, Canadians, and two people opposite coast in the US. Someone was always on to tell the others to hop on for defense. 
---
Glory days, we ran servers lol. 
---
Sulfur Mafia.
---
Couldn't agree more... I literally am having to move closer to the screen and focus on the drone window to see drone damage it's crap.  Maybe my settings /UI / monitor are crap idk... But never had a problem until they made the bars/window different shades of the same color... Ugh these guys really just aren't good and making changes that feel good or make sense.
---
I've played for longer than 10 minutes, and thought the drone damage indicator was wrong.
---
Your ship goes right to left as it takes damage. 
---
The drone indicator should always have been the same as your ship, having it the other way was a strange design choice. 
---
&gt;But it does mess with every player who actually is paying to play the game and probably 95% of which read left to right.
---
No it doesn't. It didn't mess with me, it was an improvement. How the hell have you managed when your ship has always taken damage right to left?
---
i think CCP is also going to like 350b in isk disappearing into a sink.
---
Get better soon
---
Since when we're tech workers the main eve players?
---
Spodbless you, good sir
---
Exactly. People like him can't see their own reflection.
