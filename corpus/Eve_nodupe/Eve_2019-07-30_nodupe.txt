Did CCP say somewhere that they wanted to break up the highsec keepstar cartel?

I don't usually post on reddit, but good work on the AAR, minor corrections: The war dec had nothing to do with the Marauder kill although that was frustrating. It had to do with SOL coming down and shooting defensive entosis ships during a timer. Truthfully I would have hoped you guys would see we were in a defensive timer and offer to help your old buds but I get it, kills are kills right? But the war dec was in response to what we saw as a sov attack. 
---
Ya high sec mechanics and the war dec system has a critical flaw leading to Logi issues on both sides. Our logi was in a tail spin and pretty much couldn't rep at all. Champ select loss though, the Gilas is very good, and our AB ferox was just out classed. I stayed on grid though and took it like a man because you know people were having fun. 
---
Was well flown by gal mil, good pinging on the grid, good execution.
---
Yes, it feels like a buff for traders since their skills are now more efficient.
---
https://youtu.be/T_x1fYm-VBk
---
Yep, this is very accurate.
---

---
It's as if they think that EVE is some exciting new game with a massive, steady influx of new players who they can grief endlessly without consequence.
---
That, or they really do think that EVE would be fun as a virtual minefield, bereft of any skill or intelligence, where you just wander around until you randomly blow up.
---
Ecm asteros in novices and batphones to snuff
---
It's been dropping pretty hard since the combined blackout and Plex sale. Might be back to 1b/month soon enough...
---
It clearly isn't a perfect system that we should allow to run rampant. It also isn't going to work in a future where automation actually takes jobs away without creating any new ones -- and that's going to be our future.
---
So we need to find something else regardless.
---
&gt; We just stockpile weapons and don’t PVP anyone in our WH until they shoot at us
---
congrats you've invented Goonswarm
---
lol got a damn good laugh out of that one.
---
Just remove the ability to anchor citadels in wh’s if asset safety gets removed from null
---
Can you essentially already do this, and piss a bunch of people off by making them pay 25%?
---
When buying a ship + fit, the buying window will notify you if you already have a module in your hangar.
---
The amount of people shooting the target plays a huge factor in how it’s calculated, but points are somewhat arbitrary. More points generally just means you didn’t blob somebody super hard, but as you’d imagine, big fleet fights get skewed because there’s almost always gonna be a ton of people on killmails in those.
---
do you realy belive that hell  is made out of  Fire and brimstone ?
---
I want to be able to put my corp/alliance logo on my character's clothes.
---
Can we bring back the old gate noises too? 
---
Bbbbbbrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr-enter the matrix-pssehhhhhhzzzzzztttttt
---
CCPLEASE
---
That could work, they can lore it that the empires/concord demand it that way. Then nullsec can still have 0%
---
every nullsec region needs npc stations, otherwise it is used like some alliances are using it as a way to escape harassment and quietly set up rental empires.
---
If they wanted to see what effect the blackout had, they wouldn't have ran TWO free sp events at the same time...
---
Ah true.
---
That's CCP's call. Nobody here will have any data.
---
I mean, crying about getting dropped is going to have folks like me coming out to play after all.
---
they dont have to turn any currently owned sov into npc sov they just add systems into the region.
---
Yeah I'd think pvp was boring too if all I did was F1 in 100 man tapi fleets
---
Is this some kind of joke that is too goon for me to understand?
---
But seriously, only the blue donut would be able to trade in jita?
---
Bring local back to null.
---
So you want to protect the player that refuses to use their brain?
---
Yes HK never blob OMEGALUL
---
Jokes on the carrier for listening :D
---
wew, hardknocks are back to rage
---
Will the taxes be applied both in NPC stations and citadel?
---
I'm sure your ideology will be well received by the droves of americans who can't afford insuline, medicine, and have to pay to a uncapped runaway system of healthcare, defense, and so on.

May i suggest you preach in Detroit or North Virginia ?
---
The blocs are rich as a whole, the per person liquid wealth is not all that high. Plenty of people will be able to outbid the blocs.
---
But you know , I will adapt.
---
I’m going to wait until this blackout and era of chaos takes its full course.
---
When everything goes up in value by 100% or more I will then liquidate my 100 bn in assets that should be 200 bn by then.
---
How,s  that for adapting?
---
Let the chaos begin.
---
3 miles was in the Soviet Union ?

It’s eve pvp , you probably salty because you got bulldozed a few times over lol ,

That’s ok the bulldozing will continue!

Whoever is willing to pay the license fee is able to trade in Jita, higher license fees means higher costs, which means higher prices they'll have to charge.
---
TIL I'm a bigot. Whoops
---
This post is retarded and you should feel bad for typing something as idiotic as it. My hope is that you purchased flavored paste to eat while typing it, so that at least someone got some enjoyment from the composition of this dumb wall of dramatic straw men.  
---
If I’m ratting in a haven, it should be instanced in case my dog gets hit by a car and I have to go rescue him. Otherwise if I get ganked while I’m AFK it’s not fair that I’m being punished for something that happened out of game. 
---
PvP should be turn based. What if I’m cooking dinner and I want to fight someone? If I have to go afk and get my food out of the oven, it’s not fair that they can kill me for something that happened out of game.
---
Asking /r/eve for business advice....

Well yeah?  That's what everyone else says, so it must be real

nice work everyone

I like that he’s willing to shake things up.  I just wish he wasn’t so biased when it came to being so anti krab and pro tanker safety.

Right right, I got you. I quite like this idea so long as it's v.cheap for the quiet stations.

This is not a shitpost. This is a high-quality satire article. That is meant to be enjoyed by the person it is about and by those who read it.
---
Also, I would like to add... 
---
We at EVE Onion think highly of Falcon and all his work, contributions, and sacrifices he makes only a daily basis being attentive to our great community.
---
it's been like 2-3 weeks, I hope you don't invest irl
---
intending for a thread to be political....   
---
.. saying the thread is an expression of appreciation...
---
lmao do you have spod brain?
---
that's not a fight, that's a dread bomb that got responded to finally - learn what the shit you're talking about holy fuck you guys are god damn brain dead
---
A creative isk sink and it would actually work
---
But it’d affect the “holy” players that shall not be touched by ccp. 
---
Cloak griefers, and Kitey gankers.
---
You should know that all mechanic changes must ONLY benefit these players or at worst have a neutral impact on them
---
You’d have gotten upvoted to hell if you said “add ammo to drones” or “to pve you have to broadcast your location to a ratter hunter channel” or other stupid bullshit to go along with it.  Live and learn
---
I'm just basing it on the title of the post. As if the sentence is a hint towards adding NPC space in drones, that's all.
---
Scroll up, it’s been a month. Will you all show up by Christmas?
---
I've had capsules with better tank.
---
Yeah, you used to be able to tell when a cap fleet arrived on grid. Not so much any more.
---
I suippose that would be the better way of doing it if this happens I guess. But at the same time it would be wierd to all of a sudden have more systems in space becuase of Drifters and rogue drones clashing.
---
Yeah, I probably should have been more direct - Are killboards still a very popular business in EVE?  Is today's EVE something a 2003's tryhard lowsec pirate going to enjoy?
---
I guess if any of those are a no, then yep, I need to find a buyer.

Walking in stations

Fcore again?

Coming from nowhere, something blown up and disappear like never been in that system...

no auto targeting system on apostle this time :/
---
Just once.  For one week have CCP nerf cloaks into the ground and remove kitey bullshit fits
---
You would see REAL tears then.
---
Ah, relic sites.
---
The only place in eve where you can make anything from 3 to 500 million isk a day.
---
This is exactly what *should* be happening.
---
I agree, its why I said it should have been done before the sheer amount of capital/ rorqual pilots were created. Its unfortunately a bit late to put the genie back in the bottle.
---
Inshabob you'll get a sansha site with 80m of plates and then four more with a piece of carbon.
---
If you can't figure out an easy solution to that I'm not sure if eve is the right game for you. Oh wait it's 2019 ... Keep on krabbing you lovely spodbrainius
---
Do you have any source for this at all? I simply can't imagine how you could, except intentionally, write a program where larger pointers were *even close* to doubling the memory footprint of your application.
---
It also depends on your expenses and what you do. 
---
In EVE, the little guys won't really notice the increase. If you're so poor you can't afford a loss, you bypass most of the taxes right away by direct sale. If you're not, well, then it's just another value in profit calculation, be it 2% or 5%.
---
I want to be able to hide from dscan behind planets
---
Using me as a measure for elite spaceship piloting is a bad decision. I'm bad at solo pvp.
---
1. Mute comms
---
2. Watch Netflix
---
This can't be stressed enough. Default UI is complete garbage. You have to know way to much stuff to figure out a usefull one yourself. Self made ones can be specific, okay.. but why is the default so shitty?!
---
And your best friend will die via decapitation from a guy born via c section?

To be fair Signal Cartel isn't absolutely no pvp, it's 'don't start a fight, or bait or otherwise instigate one'.
---
They're allowed to defend themselves and they're allowed to have pvp alts and shit so some of them are decent solo pvpers.
---
Just connect a monitor to your toaster and you're good to go
---
So 2005 :(
---
Because you can't use it to flame and try and mock people, and you can't get triggered and badpost on reddit about it
---
Dude found the perfect situation to use it and I didn't really see it coming.
---
In other words, yes.
---
like I said - I hope you don't invest irl
---
the fact you haven't looked at the market, noticed an increasing trend w/ raw moon goo prices and lower volume, and haven't been able to translate that into a forward thinking thought that maybe down the road shit might be rough, then you're as oxygen deprived in the brain as I anticipated.
---
This is the problem with all you retards in r/eve \- you can't see any patterns or recognize any trends that might hint towards something negative b/c you don't think further than 10 minutes from now. I feel bad for you, I hope this train of thought doesn't translate into real life or I would assume you flip burgers for paychecks. Like grow just a tiny bit of logic and critical thinking bro.
---
Inb4 it's somehow delve PepeLaugh

Dual monitors is how I do it
---
Session change timer should be removed from plenty actions.. like clone swapping..and I agree, we have learning clones and that time on them makes people not fight instead of swapping clone, jumping into a ship and taking a fight within 4seconds.. 30 seconds is just too god damn long. 10sec session change timer for clone swap and a jumptimer of 24-19 hours is fucking 1998.
---
&gt; You need to acquaint yourself with the saying "lies, damned lies, and statistics".
---
I'm going out on a whim here... yet I think a lot of people who play this type of game yet also need to be "stimulated" by watching netflix are lonely and the chatter may give them the feeling that other people are watching their shows with them.   
---
Just some thoughts from a decades long gamer; I've seen it all babe
---
So your complaint is I didn't actually spoon feed you a complete and perfect tool? Okay buddy
---
Lol the door.
---
It's all about Bungie. Remember the Humpday challenges, and the time of clans? Them was good times.
---
They are but unlike back there it's a monopoly right now. You're very welcome to create an alternative of course but your competition is dug in and has feature rich product.
---
It's most likely a bunch of nerdy sci-fi references put in for giggles. Quite honestly doubt it has lore implications.
---
The issue I have with this is there needs to be something to encourage people to use trade hubs other then Jita/Perimeter If there is only one real hub, then it's always going to be split by the blue doughnut. If there were 4-6 hubs that were roughly in line with each other then you would see a lot more fights, with each major null block sponsoring a hub and competing with each other.
---
Unfortunately, I can't see a way to make this happen again. Logistics has just gotten too easy. It doesn't matter if you're living close or far from Jita, between alts, JFs and transport services, you can always get close to the Jita price and liquidity, so there's no reason to shop at Hek or even Amarr. Making logistics much harder would force the hubs to spread out, but I'm not sure how you could do that in a way that would keep the game playable. Remove JFs and split HS into 4 regional islands maybe? The rage from doing that would be legendary tho.
---
Respect to ehfkae for taking the fight into hard knocks home system.
---
My poor meta 4 ewar modules.
---
I don’t know why they are doing a price hike.  Concord hasn’t really lifted a finger to protect  anyone anyways
---
That's kind of the idea, Jita for convenience, somewhere else for the best deals.
---
Of course but they are not a pvp Corp so no point in joining if you want to pvp
---
Take what I'm saying with a big grain of salt, but as someone who runs a site that started as an EVE-focused blog, I would say traffic has definitely dropped to a degree that it would be hard to focus on that as a niche alone.  Other big EVE sites are struggling for rankings, and mine is as well as Google continues to monkey with things.
---
In all honesty, it's probably only a good idea if you have a solid plan, to that end, here's some things to consider:
---
* What can you offer that makes you more appealing both to users and advertisers?
---
* What's your SEO/marketing plan? 
---
* What content will exist on the site? Content needs to exist to bring in traffic, and trying to outrank established killboards is one hell of an uphill battle.
---
* Can you maintain interest in the game as it maintains a stagnant period? This applies to creating new content as well, as continuing to create content for a site you might not have faith in is hard as hell.
---
If you cannot answer these questions, or are unsatisfied with the answers, you might want to strongly consider selling.
---
Every fucking point you made involve been logged on, so whats the problem?
---
Things I care more than my wife's health, my mental health and my career:

Fake space money.

Get a grip dude. In the situation where any of these things occur, pulling yourself back to reality to deal with the here and now should be of your utmost priority, aka, being an adult.
---
canon

ACL hangars for all my toonies

Who's the competition? Monopolys are easy to beat.

EDK and its variants are what were popular when I left.  (I was running a EDK modded to autoprovision sub-KBs in a [yournamehere.podkill.net](https://yournamehere.podkill.net) back in the day)
---
Prices up 10, maybe 15%. And I’m personally thinking that’s mainly due to blackout.  Of course goons are happy to claim any credit for the price increase, but sadly, it’s the blackout. 
---
Speaking of growing, let the world know when your tiny nuts drop. It’s cute when squeakers like you get on comms and talk mad shit. 
---
P.s. tell mittens he is a piece of crap.
---
It must really be an odd experience to exist as someone who is seemingly so completely unaware of reality outside of EVE.
---
yeah dude someone was talking about the color of their shit and it turned into a 4 way conversation, like wtf
---
You just have to rag in other systems to make them better iirc
---
&gt;being an adult  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Having a crappy childhood is a large part of why " **Be remembered and recognized in gaming community for years to come** " would look good to someone.  
---
&gt;oh right, i'm in a world of hungry ghosts.
---
if asset safety were removed you probably just wouldn't have any structure market outside of sovnul.
---
It may or may not have occurred to you that these things are, hopefully, of a temporary nature, and once they're resolved you will, most likely, want to return to the game.
---
Do you know what will make a person NOT want to return to the game? Being kicked when they're  down because they wouldn't make EVE more important than RL.
---
No-one of sound mind and reasonable intellect is going to log back on after an unexpected and forced leave of absence, see all their shit gone, and think to themselves "Yes, this is fair, I absolutely deserved this".
---
Unless im being wooshed, a controller is not going to work out for eve.
---
Yes kid...I fricking understand man.
---
But more than the theft, which is real, neither side of the US political system really, truly, wants to do anything different. 
---
Sorry...I was digressing from Eve.  
---
Make Rorquals great again. :-)
---
Rattlesnake.  Will top 1600 DPS with bling fit and good skills.  
---
If you absolutely despise drones and must do a pure missile boat you could do a barghest if you want to pay twice as much for the hull, or see how much damage you can get out of the navy raven.  But the rattlesnake will beat both of them handily on both DPS and tank, for the same price or less.
---
Did you actually look at anything outside of Delve? Compared to delve neither region is barely having people touched. Delve sees more ratting in its meh systems than in Fountain's best systems. You also didn't look at PB which has a few of its good systems not even being touched. Literally 0 NPCs killed in the last 24 hours Personally I would remove sec status based ratting completely if I were implementing this new system(which is completely theoretical and we have 0 reason to believe it will be put in). In the end this system needs more thought than just having bounties adjust.
---
EWAR is not just ECM.
---
At least more active than the last time someone invaded their hole.
---
Man, it annoys me like hell that my grinded standings with NPC factions are useless. Good standings takes a lot of time to grind and taxes are still no way near to be competitive to player owned stations. And now they will increase NPC taxes once again. I just don’t get it this change.
---
this is an important point; also instead of just making bash fleets all the time it is a good idea to ensure there is no sensible reason for people trading plex/injectors to go use random trade structures.
---
I swear, seeing that name alone gave me 'nam flashbacks.
---
Not great, not terrible?
---
How many people died due to 3 mile island? 
---
How many people were injured? 
---
How many cases of cancer can be directly attributed to 3 mile island?
---
The answer to each of those questions is the same.
---
&gt; I let other people do it who have the skills trained.
---
Don't you mean 'use a market alt'?
---
[https://zkillboard.com/](https://zkillboard.com/) is the only kill board that matters right now

other killboards are pretty much only run to filter out kills that the organization running it doesn't want people to see for whatever reason
---
Sounds like things haven't changed since he was in FCON.
---
I think we should ignore the day to day impact of every mechanic in favor of extreme edge cases.
---
No it isn't me :)
---
Has the CSM seen their recent performance?
---
Have you talked to the one other guy who runs Eve through Wine to work out a fix?

 W h o c a r e s . j p g
---
Rorqs would love the price hikes!
---
Yup, and like anyone doing a good job, deserves appreciation 😀
---
When I first heard of it I thought “haha sucks to be someone who sells all their stuff on the market” before promptly realizing that I am that kind of person
---
"Make them literally unusable."
---
No. 
---
This is a terrible idea.
---
Sexy Gila fleet you got there. You guys would fit right in with Calmil and Sparton.
---
Honestly, I have no plan at this point, I'm just trying to figure out if its worth coming back.   To add, my sites have never been about the ads or traffic - They've always been about providing killboards, teamspeak/mumble/ventrilo and other eve themed collab services.
---
SEO in the past came easy to the killboards thanks to heavy metadata use and the fact that everyone has said "I got pod killed" at one point or another, but I think the marketing plan would just to be free and ad-free for general use.  Private subdomains with custom themes and changes could be a sold service.  
---
I already own the servers and good reliable service behind a CDN is cheap, so profit isn't a major concern.
---
My issue is interest, what's changed the last several years?  Why are we stagnant?  Whose had their head cut off?
---
Fax not carrier. Problem solved
---
Replace Fozzie with Falcon. Eve needs this.
---
I’m curious what they’ll do with assets on accounts that have been inactive for a long time.  It would be shitty for players to return to the game after a year or two away and suddenly find out all their assets are gone because structure mechanics changed in their absence.

chossuh and friends were out hunting for targets. After a number of near misses, we ended up near Delve, where a distraction tackle baited the super response fleet elsewhere while the actual fleet landed on the intended target. Supers eventually started landing, the Hel went down, we fragged another Thanny under their noses for the memes and moonwalked out, then fought their response fleet on our way back to the hole. 
---
The FCs, logibros, command dessies, sabre pilots, scanners, other fleets, etc were the heroes of the day. I just recorded the fun.

Humans are driven by fringe edge cases.  Few people fear car crashes, but fear if flying is common, despite planes being the safest mode of travel and cars being one of the least safe.
---
If your just planning on hosting existing services there isn't much I can think of that isn't already being handled well.  
---
If you planning on building/writing new services we are in need of a good browser based fitting tool, but it will need to be at least as good as Pyfa on basic functionality.
---
CCP doesn't officially support linux/wine. It has been well known for the 16+ years of eve and all of PC gaming history that windows, for all its faults, is still the best and most supported gaming platform on PC.
---
Complaining that your turbo niche and widely unsupported environment and OS has issues is laughable at best, moronic at worst.
---
Shocked it took people this damn long to figure out its easier to bait the umbrella elsewhere than it is to whine ccp into nerfing everything that can kill you while hunting
---
This was incredible incitefull thank you.
---
There’s a permanent one in Dead End too
---
Correct. In the rules, you cant substitute for houses. Since you need houses to upgrade to hotels, it behooves you to buy up all the houses. Thereby creating a monopoly.
---
Refuse to sell the houses or upgrade and eventually everyone else will run out of money.
---
I gave up, uninstalled, then rebuilt wine from source.

"participate in fleet pvp"

"Get blobbed by 1300 nulltards"
---
totally the same thing...
---
CCP acknowledges that their 64 bit client doesn't work well on such configurations for Linux/Mac, and for now, anyway, still offers a 32 bit client. 
---
I will continue to use that client as my daily driver until the point that the 64 bit client proves sufficiently stable that I no longer need to submit crash reports and/or attempt to debug it.
---
for someone saying that this is just a game so he doesn't care, OP has surely replied to a lot of comments
---
Thats part of the fail for not calling it out....... U must be just as bad
---
so ships shooting each other is not a fight? gotcha
---
However future was predicted.....
---
Blob others.
---
Get blobbed.
---
Ciirrrrrrcle of life

Balancing the game around people who aren’t playing, or extreme edge cases is great game design.

---
Ok only if at the same time we can ban multi login.
---
Wait until this kid gets his first W-2 XD
---
&gt; as more nullsec people stop sending materials up and start sending final products to directly compete?
---
This is bogus, and anyone who actually knows anything about industry/hauling can tell you that. If null starts sending finished product they will half the time burn as much fuel as the value of the goods they're exporting and most of the time they aren't, they'd still be unable to compete. JF travel isn't free and they don't hold infinite m³. For the vast majority of things you can build from compressed ore, you would make less isk exporting the finished product (and paying the extra fuel costs for the many extra trips)than simply exporting the ore.
---
&gt; Time to skill up the trade skills.
---
If you've been selling any notable value of goods, you probably should have a long time ago. :P
---
LOL

So why yall not jackin each other off to this all GFs an shit lols.. Tools all of you!

\+1 from me. Like the changes or not, the dude is awesome.
---
Thanks CCP Falcon for coming down here and slumming it with us!
---
imo what blackout actually did was show us how weak subcap PvE ships really are, and how strong cloaky hunting is. Having said that, if you're strolling gate to gate in a group of bombers and no one is picking you up on Intel, theres a problem with the Intel.
---
Whatever works for you I suppose.
---
You're going to be forced to use the 64 bit client soon enough though as they announced they're switching over the default client and depreciating the 32 bit one in the coming months. They also responded to a question at eve north Toronto about the wine issues on 64 bit and responded firmly with "we don't support linux".
---
Nothing is wrong with multi boxing i didn't say anything was wrong with it, i multi-box. Multi boxing is just the most common way of making allot of money and the comment i replied to was talking about multi boxers.

There are fewer ISK faucets with blackout in effect. People are adopting but so are PvPers who are there to cull the herd. Goons and Dinos are moving towards crabbing in Titans, supers and we even saw desperate Rorqual in Anom... Dominix and it’s ilk are easy prey with blackout

That audio track is a pretty fun level in Beat Saber!

I thought New Eden’s pop was about 100B?
---
his *specific examples* are edge cases.

but there are infinite reasons why life might prevent you from playing a video game for a few days at a time.

sounds badass, all the WHers would come together
---
100% &lt;3
---
there were like 10 posts on reddit and null cried really hard and basically declared war against highsec for a few shitposts lol
---
Yeah, its the cynos that are the real problem.
---
They also use complex financial regulations to keep new players out.
---
I see no connection between this and there being any new NPC space. 
---
But if they do it, just do it. Plop down stations and adjust sov. Anybody protests they are crybabies.
---
Nice video
---
&gt;Meanwhile, the big sellers with big stacks will just list small stacks. They don't lose anything.

They lose time, which is the most important commodity to big sellers.

---
No, system security status is more important than ihub upgrades.
---
If there is balance there should be counterbalance. 
---
Cloaks countered local, now they are op.
---
Diminishing returns will counter casually mining or pve, what will be the counter?
---
CCP doesn’t change things for balance, it becomes so unbelievably lopsided that it’s gamebreaking for the one on the wrong end
---
Like the Trigs?
---
Does it effect spawn rates or bounties?
---
This does effectively cut bounties in wormhole space.

Even the “modest” PC should play fine. I find this site makes it way easier to think about building PCs.
---
Holy shit I forgot about this. Damn :'(
---
you killed me with that logic train
---
This seems such a massively RNG'd mechanics to rely on, to base an entire fleet around. Brave to AFK for taking this comp.
---
You just pitched that internet janitor into the space garbage for fake internet points man.... have you no soul?
---
You don’t have to read if it’s too hard, but you’re proving my points
---
A few of our guys already have some ideas, looking forward to the next one. Gf
---
Not really, with that many jams u can jam leshaks very reliably, remember u only need 1 successfull jam/burst to break a leshaks spool, thus not making it do full damage for 1+ minute
---
It effects anom spawns
---
You say that, but wormhole space players can lose everything do to RL events.
---
Not my characters race!
---
Edit:  Shit.  It is.
---
or just have asset safety not exist in nullsec, cost 15% in lowsec, and be free in highsec
---
lol
---
A couple of them were in leadership positions in the PVP-oriented parts of E-Uni until within the past few months. One of the logi pilots was head of the Fleet Command Community before leaving, another AFK member who wasn't in the AAR was NullSec Campus Manager (although not many other people actually live in Syndicate).
---
The struggle is truly real.
---
I was always pissed when people talked shit about Fozzie.
---
That really pissed me off.
---
Thank you /u/CCP_Falcon.
---
what the fuck?
---
Best strategy is owning the railroads.  Followed by the properties around free parking.  Best income/landing ratio (especially because people need to roll to get out of jail)
---
So one person per system wouldn’t be that bad or am I misunderstanding?
---
Its ~1% to move withing same system.
---
Or 1099 thinking he gets to keep everything he made and then poof you have to go on payment plans to the state/feds
---
Given citadels are mostly only used for buy orders, there'll still be 0% tax.
---
I've been away for a long time, can someone explain what Asset Safety is? Because when I left, if you went AFK, and left your shit in an outpost or PoS that changes hands, your shit was fucked.
---
Whether you like it or not, CCP wants players to come back after they take breaks.
---
Asset Safety is a critical component of this plan, and no one here is going to convince them otherwise.
---
It’s a mix of the two: Uncle Sam doesn’t wear black and have a hooked nose.
---
The platform they used to project the ECM is questionable. It leaves them without a win condition while damnation/drek's could attempt the same comp with more dps. 
---
I'm not sure how to calculate the AOE jam % but you have a 22~% jam chance per cycle and a 52~% chance to jam once per minute. 
---
4-5k Additional dps could've changed that fight. Im not sure that fifth mid was worth it.
---
Thanks, Falcon.
---
Delete this, it doesn't fit the narrative that supers are OP, no space AIDS is killing Eve, nerf cynos etc etc etc.
---
And launch mtu...
---
dat screen layout doe
---
That supers was shot by nearly 300 people tho.
---
You forgot /s
---
Yup maybe I’m just having to much fun ...... maybe.
---
One person per system wouldn't be able to keep ADMs up
---
I think it should be removed and replaced by something entirely different. If you lose a citadel, your stuff gets emergency jettisoned to the nearest planet. In order to recover it, you need to be apart of the group that owns the Ihub and a poco on the planet for the items to be transferred to from planetside. If another group owns the poco they can charge a tax or deny transport. This way stuff isn't lost forever, and can be recovered by taking the space back, joining a spy, or joining them outright. There would be no cost involved and it would be similar to how it used to be when stations would flip. Change poco models/textures to look like a mini station from current in game assets to have it make sense that it could hold higher mass items such as capitals, leave all the other poco mechanics the same as they currently are as undockable player owned structures. They would behave like SMAs in terms of moving ships into space for recovery, its could be dragged to cargo. Now you have your stuff back, but you are in space with it. :)
---
People would fight hard to defend their stuff instead of pressing a button and moonwalking out before any kind of memorable event or battle could occur. This would also encourage guerilla warfare after the war and actually trying to retake space lost. Freighters visiting PoCos would be a sight to behold!
---
Came here (copious amounts)expecting to to say HTFU... bested by logic and reason...
---
its a one sided brawl in both act 1 and act 2 - how do you fucking windowlickers not understand this???? is this really quantum fucking science for you?
---
bro your math is so bad and your general understanding of supply &amp; demand is flawed in so many ways it's laughable
---
So, battle venture for hunting bots?
---
I approve of this comment.
---
byeeee
---
Yeah, no: it’s both. That particular nose and black top hat combo are common tropes in 19th and 20th century antisemitic propaganda, and antisemitism was a common part of Soviet Cold War propaganda against the West in the 50s and 60s. 
---
A quick Google search for “antisemitism Soviet propaganda” will probably give you the evidence you need to verify that.
---
X2 capgun Nags (the more the better)
---
X1 armour Fax
---
x2 Vindi
---
x1 Screening ship (or a scram chain to stop boosh)
---
10X amarr jam armour Scorps
---
Be sure your fax has a cap transfer and has a good pilot. Keep the leshaks and guards jammed to keep your timer paused and your fax alive. blap through their fleet with nag volleys and hope they don't have more than 30 people or cruise ravens cause the counters there require much more effort.
---
How many does it take to keep level 5? Do you know or naw?
---
This isn't a bad thing. It forces players to trust certain entities, opens up avenues for economic warfare, and generally makes New Eden more ruthless. This combined with the tax hikes on NPC stations means that you get a tradeoff between trading in player stations with better margins but the risk of losing everything and trading in NPC stations with lower margins but a guarantee of safety for your assets.
---
One feature which balances this is your ability to eject all the items you have in a station into space at any time, so you can pick up your stuff even if your docking rights are disabled.
---
Hey, you're right. More than one person is an idiot.
---
LoL!
---
Whether I like it or not, people came back before asset safety was a thing.
---
He is paid to interact with the community.  Its litterrally his job...

---
For being lazy.  Another ship will work, just warp to accel gate and they'll bitch out to the sun.  You just need to beat them to the sun and have dual scram.
---
i understand you dont think its a fight, but it is.
---
And then the ratters get W-2s
---
Lower the comms volume so you can still hear them but it’s not as loud. You can also watch netflix with subtitles.
---
Me Gusta!
---
Wow
---
Naw
---
Asset safety should be removed, maybe not in highsec, but def for nullsec. Putting your stuff in someone else’s citadel is stupid though.
---
Plus he is such a sweetie!!  
---
[https://i.imgur.com/KhaWHLC.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/KhaWHLC.jpg)
---
Depends on the situation.
---
I'll listen to YouTube in the background while I'm running Incursions with WTM. I'll just mute everyone but the FC and turn down the volume on the YouTube video. It means I can still hear FC calls and still be able to listen to stuff. It helps that I listen to podcasts and such, where it's not as important to hear everything that's said.
---
I do sorta the same thing when I'm out mining for my corp, though I don't mute anyone. Comms tend to be pretty clear unless someone's out roaming so it's usually easy to listen to something else. In this case I tend to tab out and pause what I'm listening to if there's a spike in chatter, though.
---
&gt;I'm going out on a whim here... yet I think a lot of people who play this type of game yet also need to be "stimulated" by watching netflix are lonely and the chatter may give them the feeling that other people are watching their shows with them.
---
Not necessarily. One of my friends watches Netflix while he krabs because he has ADHD and it helps keep him focused.
---
Its the reason I got into the game. Got into EVE right when I got my economics degree.
---
Love me some steven hackett.
---
Wouldn't be the first time someone has been doing solid work and got knifed and shitcanned by a company.
---
AAR from AFK, going to go into actual detail since this comp prob wont get used again. 
---
We wanted to try out a non-leshak comp, and used sleipnirs for several reasons. They cant be firewalled (which was the reason we didnt use damnations), are capless, and have selectable damage. They also have an incredibly high EM resist, which goes well with our SB vindis. The double plate fit gets to about the same EHP as a t3 with a better resist profile for us and additional mids. 
---
HK countered us by reshipping from legions to lokis, which share the minmatar high EM resists, and by bringing an incredible amount of neuts (9 bhaals wtf). The sleips did well until our ewar wing got shredded by the lokis, and we just didn't have the cap to do much to stop it. After that, the shaks were able to spool a lot more, and was all downhill from there. 
---
All in all, was a GF, and an experimental comp that we wanted to try. Obviously was not successful, so we're going back to the drawing board to what kind of other non-leshak comps might work.
---
Because people could still sell their assets in the station they had been in.
---
CCP can't break them up and this has only encourage more wagon wheeling.
---
Wow TIL if I had 300 people and the enemy was stupid enough to not have even a single backup fax FAX among 50k characters I could kill a super in Delve with subcaps.
---
Guys if only we knew!!13
---
Depends what they are in and how autistic they are
---
Really? Because you could still sell your stuff in the station it was in.
---
\&gt;Protected by CONCORD
---
\&gt;Mad when CONCORD asks for money
---
Suddenly Spaceships flair? Gotta be bait.
---
I'm not riled up this is how I talk
---
you're really bad at this
---
iirc you could remote sell, but only to instant buy orders. meaning you made pennies on your actual asset value. I'm talking like, 2009/10 ish.
---
5% mark down was about all it took to sell trapped assets, better than the asset safety tax now
---
Sorry, did I hurt your feelings? I’m looking at going to eve Vegas again this year. If I make it will you be there? I’ll buy you a beer to make up for it. 
---
(Assuming the judge let’s you travel out of state of course,....and your parole officer lets you drink...)
---
That is why many of us who have done lots of pvp roaming would have been ok with delayed local. We knew this is going to turn nullsec meta towards cloaky wormhole stuff.
---
This also shows how large game knowledge gap is between pvp players and pve players. Roamers immediately figured out how to play in this new meta but most nullsec ratters are struggling to figure out how to counter it. For example few roaming bombers are easy as hell to kill if you know what you are doing.
---
Buy RAM. Shitloads of RAM. 
---
If you're crazy enough to actually multibox 10+ accounts you'll want a minimum of 32GB. Speed not hugely important in this context, just choose what will pair nicely with your processor.
---
my remark is that your spreadsheet is useless  buddy :)
---
At this point they have no other messaging than,”Everything is F-ing great!!!!  You are going to love us making NS ‘less safe’.  Screw anyone that feels differently.  They need to HTFU“  
---
Saying just about anything other than that, or actually acknowledging that some reasonable number of people who play this game are actually pretty concerned, would show weakness in a pretty fragile game.  
---
Bob love them, the current narrative is that they are willing to go ‘all in’ with a revamp and change in the tone of the game (at least that’s what it looks like).  When you have committed to play this hand till the end, there is very little wiggle room to equivocate.  You smile, put your chips in, and hope you were right.
---
Lmao this is gold, and also a real shame, I used to have great respect for Tsukino. Sadly, his brain has turned into a milkshake.
---
I wouldn't go so far as to say that's a reason why we can never do it, so much as it's a reason not to 'put all your eggs in one basket.'
---
The risk of being completely shafted by other players in pretty-much a core principle of the game, and goes well with 'don't fly what you can't afford to replace,' or 'don't go afk in space.'
---
If they go ahead with asset removal, then given the above example, I wouldn't be surprised to see:
---
A) A change to unanchoring mechanics, i.e. proximity to DownTime, or...
---
B) A big change in just how much 'loot' can be stored/traded in any given structure.
---
Move your shit to a npc station if you can't risk it. Or log with it in your capital. Rule number 1 - don't fly what your can't afford to lose. Rule 2 - don't buy what you can't afford to replace
---
Wormholers tend to not store valuable things in jspace because they often dont have to(excluding things they build in there knowing they cant take them out) and have easier access to highsec or low sec stations than alot of null sec.
---
Don't rig your shit, and build freighters.
---
No it shouldnt be removed.
---
No, I like asset safety in null as well.
---
I fully expect some kind of grandfathering to happen. Assets on accounts inactive before a changeover will still follow the old system until that account reactivates.
---
Verone for President!
---
Dude you have like 2 solo kills in the last 4 years
---
just stop typing
---
Obviously no one is sure about what's to come, but I do think there's a chance we may get drifter ships. If we do, I think they'll be the opposite of trig ships: shield instead of armor (obviously), since trigs have gotten us AFs and HACs so far, we'll get a marauder trig ship and cov ops frig and cruiser drifters and a drifter blops.
---
Of course there's so many different possibilities, but that's how I think I'd go if we end up with drifter ships.
---
Yep and with the way ccp is talking I don't think anything is off the table...for better or worse.
---
No your mom and I have plans while you’re out of the basement.
---
Except for assets in POSes. 
---
But... And it's a big but...
---
POSes were always designed with loss of assets in mind. Every single person who put stuff in a POS had fair warning in advance.
---
Nice! What was the distraction?
---
Make them items. Add a skin slot to all structures and make it so you can buy one with plex / however they do it currently. This way one person can’t give 100 structures skins.
---
You're so good with words... :)
---
Buy 4 curved ultra wide monitors, stack them vertically. Split screen the clients.
---
Fair
---
Which is fine. It's been that way from the get-go. 
---
Changing the rules afterwards isn't cool. Imagine your boss or landlord changing your contract or lease after you signed it.
---
I agree, and apparently we should also ignore Courier Contracts, Corp-mates, and anything else at all that would help!    
---
The children! Will no-one think of the children?!    
---
RL shit happens. Sometimes it's fucking horrific and heartbreaking.    
---
If you get over the heartbreak, and recover from the horror, but can't face the agony of losing space pixels when you log back into a game, seek professional counselling. If that sounds unnecessarily cruel, also seek help.
---
Your comment made me think the following.
---
The scene right after that in the car, windows all steamy:
---
Falcon: Hilmar stop being a carebear, I want to show you how you wreck the purple doughnut.
---
Hilmar: No, that's an exit Onl...  Oh Falcon...
---
Falcon: This is how you create destruction!
---
Falcon later pulls out of the brown doughnut and proceeds to reenact the EVE gate, spewing little vessels all over "New Eden"... 
---
End Scene.
---
And now everyone knows how twisted my mind is!  LOL
---
i mean, he's not wrong, ~14 bombers will get shredded by a rorqs drones
---
Historically accurate, however that's assuming I'm a pussy that mines in high sec. I'm the pussy that mines in my supercap umbrella

---
What the bots would do is still undercut you by 0.01 but not with as large a stock. Instead of 100,000 they just add 1,000 to the individual order and the problem is solved (for the botters)
---
They chose sleips as its the armor ship with the most mids that still gets decent tank, and most importantly had a really good em resist, wich is the damage type used by their 6 smartbombing ships they were counting on to slowly chew through our ships buffer to make them easier to blap. Unfortunately we had 9 bhaalgorns to shut down those smartbombs.
---
But wait... I thought capitals were oppressive...  This proves otherwise.

Been there a good while now

Making changes to any game wouldn't be so difficult if designers would stop making their interacting features into NP-hard problems.

It's what killed Hawks.. Now I only see the echoes of them without those like three people

Actually I feel like caps are in a good place since the application nerfs. Faxes could use some tweaking in their effectiveness to sub caps.
---
Let them sing.
---
You could slap that same expectation on citadels. You wanna live out of a super flexible throwaway structure in null sec? You might lose some stuff. Sounds reasonable.
---
I agree, but I've seen so many Capital nerf posts I think I'm a tad bit salty.
---
They indeed had 5/10 more dudes but that isn’t what made the difference. The mass of the HK fleet was probably too high to cross a C5 hole even with all those BS to
---
Was an amazing fight  ! Gf
---
I wouldn't say it was stupid, just risky.    
---
Balancing (and accepting) risk is a fundamental part of play in this game. Don't expect much support though... a noisy (minority?) are still sour at losing local.
---
Before Asset safety was a thing there were stations scattered across nullsec that never died, so the contents were recoverable. 
---
CCP would move things to lowsec for people if they asked, provided they were returning from a long break or had some similar problem.
---
Upvote.
---
I'll take what is the concept of kicking someone while they're down for 400 Alex
---
how quick do you need to be to ensure you get your trades done before either the lowtax citadel is taken offline / destroyed or the owner hikes the taxes ?
---
while it is possible that this will lead traders to diversify their trading activities, historically what has happened is that they raise their prices to include the taxes which leads buyers to move to the hubs with established trading citadels which leads the smaller hubs to dry up
---
But muh reward for ~~attacking~~ *AFKing some Oracles and Myrms on abandoned* ~~enemy~~ structures!!!
---
Jesus some of these fits not very good. The anti tackle one is kinda all over the place and a lot of misinformation in the explanations
---
Infiltrator IIs only go 3450m/s (with drone nav) which is not nearly fast enough to force off a ceptor. You will have to use lights anyways so replace it with a defensive web to try and keep ram jags off you
---
2200m/s on the vni itself is quite slow for nano gangs in general so the margin for error is quite small compared to faster cruisers
---
You cant use the extra drone control range from the DLA, since if you are sitting at 80km away, it takes ages for your drones to fly over and assist, in a game where 30 seconds can mean life or death for whatever ship you are trying to screen for. Just replace it with a neut and fly with your main gang at like 30-40 away from the blob.
---
Replace the sig amp with an enam so a light breeze doesnt force you off the field
---
If you sit at 30-40, 250s arent really needed and you can use 200s. Use thorium for standard dps and swap to anti if you are in point range of something
---
Dont use t2 cap boosters, electrochemical ones hold the same amount of charges for less pg
---
Empty mid should be a point.
---
Swap nozzles for a poly since the extra speed is very valuable
---
Swap the bulkheads for opti rigs so anti can hit to point and thorium for normal engagements
---
This. I built a crazy system running on NVME drives and a shit-tons of cores, but skimped on RAM because of the stupidly-high prices at the time. Don't do that.
---
No, people just aren't capable of reading comprehension. "Indefinite" is different from "permanent". It means there's no defined end point.
---
Yes, but it is generally a bad idea.
---
Good discussion.
---
Funny thing about life events.... you don't plan them. You would never be able to move your shit to an NPC station if you suddenly were AFK for a period of time longer than it takes to unanchor a structure...
---
They raised taxes with the introduction of citadels with the goal of creating conflict drivers in highsec as people fought over control of trade hub citadels.
---
What happened was that many traders moved to the citadels, especially for high value items like plex/injectors and large volume trades. For the traders that decided it wasn't worth the effort, often because of a lack of stable trade citadels in smaller hubs, they simply included the tax in their pricing and the cost of goods went up. The increase in the cost of goods made jita even more attractive to customers than the wider selection already made it, which drove the populations of the smaller hubs down.
---
Pre-citadel Amarr local would regularly be in the 7-800 range, now it struggles to hit like 300. Similar drops in population occured in Rens/Dodixie, but they started with even smaller populations.
---
You do you.    
---
The 'broadcast for reps' appeal is there for a reason, and if someone returns to the game while they're still in a 'bad place', you should do what you can to help them.    
---
Please don't feed their trauma by insisting their space pixels were actually important.
---
I'm not really convinced with the sleipnirs still. I guess there would be a worry about bombing your own ham's. But damns would do this better. The smartbomb strategy lacked cap redundancy to be effect 9 bhaals weren't required to take that down in entirety.
---
People from Massachusetts need to stop using that ‘sales tax’ excuse and admit that getting out of Massachusetts once in a while is just something they do to keep their sanity.
---
If all the market is in Perimeter the new players will be told to go trade there when they ask. If they aren't currently asking, and being told to go trade in Jita, they already aren't trading in the right place.
---
&gt; Before Asset safety was a thing there were stations scattered across nullsec that never died, so the contents were recoverable.
---
Like the conquerable ones you'd struggle to get your shit out of if you no longer owned it?
---
&gt; CCP would move things to lowsec for people if they asked, provided they were returning from a long break or had some similar problem.
---
A support ticket is not a game mechanic.
---
why did horde and goons stop attacking you?
---
oh that's right. vily made a deal.
---
Lol. 
---
Once this game is legit dead and gone and the servers are down, I'm going to actually truly miss Eve comms. Like there are some seriously high [low] quality conversations that you could never have with an Arma clan or in basically any other game. 
---
Eve hits that sweet spot where you get a chance to listen to people sperg about anything and everything on comms but theres still a reason to be on comms because fun shit could happen on a moments notice.
---
It would be nice to see a market activity index.
---
If you really want to give it some legs though, give players a per-citadel market order slot set in addition to their cluster-wide market order slots.
---
It's a *cassus belli.*
---
Also, it's not like they can't improve upon it later.
---
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth HK the Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the nullseccers would tell you. It’s a wormhole legend. Darth HK was a dark lord of the wormholes, so powerful and so wise he could influence the holes to control evictions. He became so powerful, the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power. Which of course, eventually, he did. He taught a Init spy everything he knew and then the spy scouted in Init freighters in his sleep. It’s ironic, he could save others from evictions, but not himself.

Trading on trends/opportunities, sure there is a little 0.01ing, though not nearly as much as straight flipping/making isk purely off of current spread. [https://www.adam4eve.eu/](https://www.adam4eve.eu/) has the best charts/data/tools for trading in this manner. The cost of trading in that way is time learning the market and industry chains, and learning to predict behaviors. And it takes higher capital to do effectively over straight flipping. I currently probably do about 50/50 flipping and trend trading. 95% of it in Jita.
---
As for some ideas not mentioned, unused BP and industry slots are unrealized profit. Some more passive stuff would be like researching construction component BPO's (only 5m a pop) and selling them in packs. Making citadel components and citadels off of BPC's could be a thing, the run times are longer than a lot of things and just take straight minerals, so not a lot of set up to consitently use manufacturing slots.

Have you ever heard of contracts?

They sure are and they should move to highsec and lowsec where they belong.

1:46:50 - Falcon We should kill asset safety, I believe if you put something down into space, if it gets destroyed it's gone. A lot of people will disagree and risks will be too high. Hilmar The fact that we have NPC stations with infinite amounts of storage space is a huge cop out. We had something earlier on that we had to remove that limited how much you got store in NPC stations. Now with asset safety and citadels you can have billions of ISK in capitals with no limit no upkeep and all safe. You can accumulate too many things. To have such much weapons of war you need fuel to power them, the fact that you can just have titans lying around is not natural and not good gameplay. Something needs to be done, it's not natural, it's not eve.

Honest question from a non-wormholer, do you feel like you got blobbed at all in this fight? Is this number difference common in high class wh space fights?

Probably, yet I can’t help but wonder.🤔

The most memorable moment I have is during a bwf gatecamp, with everyone trying to convince someone that he was gay, after he said something on comms about not liking how a vagina looked, and then saying he could appreciate a good looking dick when someone asked further.

---
Were you worried about being firewalled from your own bombs? Is so what the decision for sleips over lokis only because of the fifth mid?
---
So is this actually going to happen? Or is this just more speculation based on Interbus saying they were unavailable for comment a few weeks ago?
---
It's drawn out because it's used as filler for updates that don't have as much successful projects by the time of release.  
---
It takes basically minimal effort to delete a few item IDs and change the values of others.  It keeps the fanbase chattering in circles about NP-hard problems, while not actually doing anything actually difficult to keep the meta fresh.
---
It's clever, really.
---
HK do nothing but let their land on CE be captured from weekends to now and they still take isk from renting corps
---
cmon now it had one adaptive invuln. i'm sure that did approximately fuck all.
---
Wait til you hear about mining lasers that cut out the middle-man by mining raw isk, and Rorquals that compress the isk into Plex, allowing players to buy the minerals they actually wanted from npc seeded orders. That idea should be along shortly...
---
There's enough "fuck null just because" sentiment in this sub that Poe's Law comes into play.

That sounds like a lot of new code for a feature that will be executed relatively seldom, as features go.
---
the fifth mid and the ridiculous EM resist
---
1-2 undertanked capitals are easy for a prepared force to deal with. 10-20 tanked to the teeth capitals are what you normally get dropped on you tho.
---
yeah a touch. is k
---
And yet folks will still scream that carriers are OP - bad carrier pilot all the same 😁
---
Loki's do share that resist profile. I'm having a really hard time with the sensor damps, how effective did they end up being?
---
Or even just in the vicinity of them.  They are loud signals.
---
It's easiest to hide any signal in loud background noise, such as a sun.  The place players should be most visible, is in interplanetary space and at close range.
---
It would be completely fine to let ships be invisible when in sites or belts, unless they are warping or have an MWD active.
---
Aideron is not in fedup anymore? Or is your flair not accurate.
---
@this rate of shake i cant wait till they remove asset safety and send an army of npc to kill the thing in HS
---
You're going to come back from your dishes one day and wonder where your MTU went... and why your mailbox is flashing...
---
(MTUs are legally kill-able, for want of a better phrase).
---
That should have been how CCP done it. The expectation should have been there from the start.
---
But CCP didn't do that. The expectation was never originally there. The decision was made several years ago. 
---
Instead, they went with a lame system (on by default, no fitting requirements on the structure, no upkeep requirements, no way to opt-out). 
---
The fact is, for better or worse, the players of Eve have now been forced down this path. Asset Safety was a huge contributing factor in whether people would use Citadels at all. I'd argue it was *only* contributing factor. 
---
There's been years worth of decisions made that were dependent on the existence of Asset Safety. Years worth of people temporarily *winning Eve* with stuff in the depths of nullsec because they know they *can* come back later on.
---
It would be grossly unfair to those people to remove Safety. 
---
# The only fair way to remove Asset Safety is via a time machine. 
---
Literally go back to in time to 2014(?) Reykjavik, and *Sarah Connor* the people making the decisions. For all my continued rhetoric about *keeping* Asset Safety, if I had a time machine, I certainly would prevent it from ever being implemented in the first place.
---
Yes. Jump in carriers. They still apply PERFECTLY to subcaps. Yes jump them in muahahahahaha
---
Maybe I phrased my initial post a little to literally. I know that you could remote sell and make courier contracts. But that all required human and player interaction, and you had to hope that whoever controlled the space you used to live in was friendly. 
---
I'm just trying to figure out what asset safety actually is, because it sounds like it's an expensive, but zero-risk method of getting your bling out of null while requiring zero human interaction.
---
I think that we could come to a middle ground here: asset safety you could manually trigger. Few situations would make it so that you couldn't trigger it manually before your leave of absence and be unable to petition ccp to trigger it for you.
---
Funny, that is me irl too.
---
Not if they literally just fucking warp away and then come back?
---
It brings your stuff to a nearby lowsec station for a 15% fee. Unless you live in that area of lowsec or didn’t own much you’ll still need to either firesell or courier contract it
---
Lowkey thought you were referring to Silent Infinity...

1. Make the "new" map usable so we don't have to use the old map. With blackout it's even more important tool as before. It lacks some of the stats from old map and its hard as hell to read. From old map you can see the stats from the size/color of the dot but new map they all look the same.
---
2. More than 250 personal fittings. My fits have been full for years. There are so many new ships added lately that 250 fits is not enough.
---
3. Fix drones. The auto-aggro setting is bugged as hell and keeps switching aggro to enemy drones etc. And switching drones to passive mid-fight is bugged also, they lose target often if you do that. Sometimes drones drop aggro on random no matter what you do.
---
I agree with this and greatly appreciate CCP Falcon's thoughts and discussions with the community.
---
Much more importantly, he has kitties! @CCP_Kitteh

Damn. That was smooth.

We tried to warn CCP when they changed FW back in 2013 or something. We told them this will happen. Many of us quit FW back then and never returned.

Why are some PI extraction cycles 30 minutes and other 15?

If I have an advanced factory running, and it isn't full on materials (say 40/20, for example) what happens when the cycle ends? Are the T1 materials lost, reused, or something else?

Everyone's comments are so mysterious. I wish there were more to this :(
---
You lost me when you called eve pve fun and said the pvp takes away from that fun. eve pve isn't fun, its a means to an end. You can make it engaging by tackling it with undersized ships but the fun in that doesn't come from actually doing it it comes from building the ship fits to do it.
---
Statistically, railroads and utilities are terrible real estate. The best ones are light blue, pink and orange if you play by the rules and there aren't many players ( expect a short game). If you anticipate a longer game, then your best choice is to get green too, otherwise yellow or red.
---
Afterwards, you want to build as many houses as possible if you play by the proper rules, as they limit the total number in the game and you need houses to build hotels, so by buying all the houses, no one else can have a lot that really hurts when you land on it.

"Senior FC" needs to put his reading glasses on.
---
This is both an extreme simplification, and an attempt to apply realpolitik to Eve, but basically, its due to the inherent [Balance of Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_power_(international_relations)) system which is the inevitable end of the system of alliances and cooperation which the current status quo allows.
---
Fighting wars is *risky*. They are unpredictable, costly, and often, unpopular.  And for the richer individuals/corporations/alliances, while their banks may have swelled, so too has the cost of war.
---
Plus, what's the gain? A war of territorial expansion normally requires some justification, whether it be lebensraum or "manifest destiny".
---
And in Eve, if one side gets a large enough advantage, they can destroy the other side. There is little room to negotiate from a total war.
---
I suppose you could have some kind of proxy wars, or limited wars,  but if you're at that point in Eve, you're probably going all in, so you're back where you started.
---
You might not even need a microphone with that setup.

High sec investors will get money out of this until market reaches equilibrium. Likewise other producers will get more  money out of their product. This does not affect smaller industrialists as the price of materials is part of the stabilizing factor of their market.   
---
Unlike irl increased spending isn't an issue because the average capsuleer is almost entirely made out of disposable money. Of course I'm sure you know all about cause and effect thanks to your middle school introduction to economics.  
---
I'll just assume you're a troll so you can save face in some capacity instead of assuming you're actually stupid enough to argue about something you're clearly ignorant about.

I second the notion of a trig blops. I wouldnt care if it cost an arm and a leg, I would pay it just to own one.
---
Doesn't do anything to fix the annoying as fuck +/- 0.01 isk bots infesting Jita.
---
From a gameplay perspective, the last few weeks have turned me off of the game. I was an industrialist with several accounts, HOWEVER I have to admit that the game is far from ruined. Im just to much of a lazy cunt to adapt, so I play the game from a different perspective now.....
---
Now from a business perspective, it still all makes sense. They took gambles that for the most part are still paying off. Including blackout, some people are returning and training, some unsubing, others actually undocking and getting some of their first legitimate kills. Eve is a wonderful place right now from what I have heard.

Don't be that guy.

You're actually a fucking brainlet

Huh? wtf? BLAP!!

That is a great achievement. Even though the haters are gonna hate, let them. I am sure because of you, they and many more, will be trying to reach the same achievement. Good job man.

Start multiple jobs bpc jobs at the same time (ex. 5 worms in one go provided I have enough minerals)
---
Redo the ui on the dumb industry job window so half of it is not useless sci-fi filler with that big circle.
---
Or you'll just put your shit in the nearby lowsec npc station.
---
Sure it will be a isk sink, but since they raised both the tax and broker fee for npc stations it will still drive more players to trade in citadels wher the broker fee is lower. And guess who has the safest citadel in highsec.

it'd be nice to chat to my fellow corp members, but when all they do is pretty much shout in loud voices about things i honestly couldn't give a fuck about it's a pretty big deterrant to wanting to spend time socialising with them.

My heavens I want all of these!! Especially the logout to character selection. Also add to it getting rid of session time major lag so I don't lag trying to dock undock or board a ship. Also maybe make the character sheet not take forever to open.

How to go about it:

"What are you in?"

Rorqual

"What is on you?"

Bombers
---
"How many?"

"Send out warrior and go uga booga in local and they will fuck ogg."

When I push the jump gate button it actually jumps the gate and doesn't derp. Doesn't always happen but when it does im faction fit 😛 Also session timers make me want to die... At least just queue a ship change and don't tell me the about the session change.

Strongly agree.. it just makes sense. Like mining the shit out if stuff should deplete stuff not make more. I get the whole "benefit for using your space" but it just makes sense.

~~Delete local~~ shit.
---
how would damns do this better? 1less mid is 1less mid that you need if you want to try that setup.
---
sleips get close to the same ehp, same dps, better application,slightly better sig/speed AND have the one mid more that you ''need''
---
imo its a very interesting approach that could actually work quite well.
---
&gt; There was absolutely no risk involved in enabling the 64-bit client.

Something you really can't know until after the fact, and given the legends of EVE's spaghetti code it isn't all that shocking of a statement to make...

When do we start shooting monuments in Jita?
---
Your trig tank is about 54% of a damnation and you have kinetic hole, Speed is 416 vs 426 a non amount. Application is also not really a factor. sig  is 240 vs 265.  
---
It really is hinging on if you need that 5th mid, 
---
You can also get better dps out of damnations, Dreks can also be used in the same role. You can also similiary get ~91.4% em resist out of a drek.

-Repairshop blinks when active ship is damaged.

-Repairshop is inactive for all but 8 hours per day, including a lunch break.

Just exactly how nearby is the nearby lowsec NPC station to [X-3AUU](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Omist/X-3AUU)?
---
This comp kind of depends on smartbombs so firewalling is an issue yeah.
---
Exactly. The point Sentient\_Blade was making that, as an adult, you indeed have to prioritize those things. I don't see how, that being the case, it'd be at all unreasonable or un-adult-like to expect not to potentially lose everything in-game because of it.
---
Not being based there, I wouldn't know. Got any NPC null out there?
---
sales taxes apply in citadels - they are going up.
---
do you people not understand how this shit works?
---
Ok buddy try damnations and get 50% of your DPS smart bombed off the grid lmao
---
"Dreks can also be used in the same role "
---
But what'd the point of that, really? What benefit would it bring to have it manually triggered? Everyone would do it anyway if they were able to, but some may not be able to for many reasons in fact.

Why not absolutions while you're at it 
---
Man you're dense ))
---
Depends. Best deal I would've gotten on some stuff that got stuck in 2008 would've been like 50% of market value. Luckily I came back to the game this year to notice that asset safety had transported the stuff last year to where I could get 'em. It was "only" 2 bil worth of stuff but to me that's not nothing even now, much less when it happened. Plus some of the ships had sentimental value, I'm weird like that. Paying the tax wasn't bad at all.
---
There is much more a difference between 3 mids vs 5 than 4 vs 5. Im questioning the comp based on that fifth mid. But ok...

---
Came here to post this, damn you!
---
a damn has like what? 50dps more? (no, i wont count drone dps that vanish as soon as a few sb's cycle) so we agree that they are basically the same. EXCEPT the one mid.
---
your better trig tank on a damn doesnt mean anything if you are missing the one mid you need for jamms. or in other words, you can ignore your tank if you are able to ''permajamm'' the dps and mitigate the incoming dps by 50%(spoolup) or even more
---
Stick to theorycrafting rolling fits, you use those more often
---
Why??
---
Sometimes you blob, sometimes you become the blob.

Not really the best use of an alpha clone alt.

For manufacturing I believe you’re limited to 1 slot and only t1 production and 1 research slot.

For mining you’re limited to a venture.

Ahhh hahaha amature hour.

I don't live there either. I had to hunt for a system *way* out in the Eastern depths because I know those regions are really far from NPC space.
---
Lmao imagine being a renter.
---
One of the factors I cannot account for in this comp is how they were actively using the bombs, the mid goes to the damp or the extra tackle. I would drop the damp. 
---
Dreks also work adding a substantial amount more dps as well as addition bombs.
---
Ok and we just forget about selectable damagetype and if we close our eyes the Bhaals and Shak heavy neuts don't exist 🤡🤡🤡

let people "vandalize" structures, if they sit still next to the structure in any ship for 10 minutes a week-long-lasting "ur gay pwnd" gets written in white paint across their structure.

If you’re triple-boxing, you have a leg up on a lot of potential targets. But either way, it’s easier and less... blow your brains out... if you do it with a friend, or two.
---
Hole control is not hard, mechanically. Just takes some preparation and googling (at least, when you have chosen a proper target).
---
If you decide to look into it further, I’ll also suggest that you avoid holes with highsec statics. Hole control is annoying when your target can easily get back in.
---
From there, you just need to scout your targets thoroughly, check the numbers, and handle the logistics. Then you’re off to the races, and you too can enjoy the mindless, skullcrushing boredom of citadel bashing. :)

Well to be fair, your post was so badly written it makes it pretty hard to understand you.
---
I don't really see CCP do it unless player culture massively changes, in the current climate. 
---
Like currently as an alliance leader your priority is to provide as much income as possible because you want your dudes in titans ASAP, this leads to a culture among super and titan pilots of the most important thing for them being the ability to grind isk rather then the ability to use there toy's.
---
Given with exception of Init and NC your average bloc get's about 1 kill mail per member per month, this seems to me like there isn't a heavy focus on pvp within basicly all the major blocs, this means culturally right now Eve alliances focus on good ratting space given that attracts the members meaning bigger safety super fleet is better. 
---
Until this attitude fundamentally dies within eve nothing CCP does is gonna change the major blocs and really i don't see it changing at this point.

Because when stations flipped you didn't lose the assets? You could typically join the conqueror and evac them or sell them via contracts? Jesus Christ. So many dumb people act like asset safety removed the ability for loot to drop from structures when that never existed outside of POS's anyway.
---
Yep.        
---
People don't see the most obvious things.         
---
Like i had accident and spent over a month in hospital after it.       
---
It was not that i wanted it to happen.
---
you shud look into where taxes go, they fund more that you may be aware of
---
You recall very incorrectly.
---
Well assets of people from old stations landed in asset safety.         
---
They need to pay isk for recovering them in some shitty station in lowsec that don't have undock.
---
Not really, Jove has been on the map forever just no way to get there (outside of AT).  They could easily have the drifters drop/create new gates to make these area open finally
---
If you can track them that is. And if you can get a response going before they book it. We used blops to jump them around as well to skip some gates. And if you were patient enough you could honestly just go AFK for half an hour. Not hard to mine on other accounts and just leave something cloaky in a hostile system. It's so low effort you can krab and roam at the same time. Maybe it's possible to catch a few but it's not easy unless the roamers are retarded. And when the effort is multiplied by the number of people going through your space. Another bomber gang coming through every ten minutes. That effort quickly turns into just not giving a fuck. People can't do that all day. When you roam null sec you have to remember you're not the first person to be there. There was likely another one of you asking for a fight not half an hour ago. It gets tiring man.

The monolith is watching, and it also interferes, sparking intelligence in primitive species, turning planets into stars when it is convenient, absorbing astronauts and converting them into creepy space foetuses after giving them dinners that include copious amounts of hallucinogenic drugs.

Jealous of someone else making monies...
---
Yes. But it's a Crow.
---
Well I only have 8g of 300m RAM and it’s perfect, but I only ever run 3-4 accounts. I know a lot of eve players go all out and get 32gigs.
---
Unfortunately I think your right , I guess call it my last hoerra to try to save it before it all crashes down to shit.
---
If it does not fix oh well , there will be other games and things to do lol.
---
Bingo
---
Some people have me on display.
---
Bah your begging skills suck!
---
I have put everything in pvp cus i like it
---
I’d say the guy jumping in a no tank carrier is the dumb one here.
---
Ok that’s good I’m not saying that’s bad lol
---
But you think you have the right to say pve is bad , are you a racist too ?
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
Ah yes, throwing a ratting carrier at bombers. A tale as old as time.
---
if it were not physically impossible and literally a bannable offence I would be shooting CONCORD as a main activity in EVE.
---
Likewise, if it were not physically impossible and literally a bannable offence to fight back against CONCORD I would be much more fine with the tax increase.
---
Tbh i like doing some pve things .. cus i never did really do it.. trying them lol
---
It's not that hard to deal with, don't have shit you don't wanna lose in a citadel like it's that simple. 
---
We have a area of space where this is already the case wormhole space and most entities seem to be able to handle it even the more casual players plus really losing everything isn't even all that bad it's just pixels.
---
like i don't agree from a think of the poor players perspective i do think in the current meta it should not be as high on the priority list as some other things, as in the current meta it likely will result in more blueing not less ( and the last thing eve needs is more nips ).

Transversal?

That’s exactly my point there is soooo much to do in eve , I for instance I can’t stand mining, tried it , I just don’t have the fucking patients for it but you won’t see me bashing and try to stop the guys game for being a miner just because some solo player thinks that that’s the all mighty eve play style how arrogant is that huh ?
---
Wow Dank, you really are a prick after all.
---
Bullshit you have to jump like 1/2 cyno's likely on a citadel your access is 99% risk free, we have to take a freighter or DST truth space this means flying and warping it in space without local where it is honestly a sitting duck for gankers, without any information if there are 10 loki's there along with a sabre or nobody. 
---
If nullseccers had to fly there stuff out you might have a point but they have jump drivers, even if it's just to get it to NPC null or lowsec. ( aka use a suitcase carrier ) 
---
Also your average wormhole doctrine pool out prices the nullsec pool massively especially when you include the implant sets.
---
About 32? I would def recommend it if it’s in your budget, with the new 64bit client we actually get to use it )
---
The only problem is that Drifter ships are based on Jove tech, which is apparently T5. The Triglavians seem to be dumbing down their ships so they can be constructed using New Eden’s fabricator systems.
---
I shudder to imagine the sheer amount of grind necessary to collect the materials for one of those beasts.
---
you have a history of making really questionable claims my guy
---
Marauders are Dorado's thing kinda, I was still in Fedup when the incident occured and he was very much chill about it. And it's not like it was the first time.
---
Lets finally get access to Jove space and learn that shit then! :-D
---
There definitely is a way to target large groups, but it will never be done because it isn't "fair." Use stats on activity to discriminate against more active groups. Use NPC's to declare war and start invasions on specific groups based upon activity metrics or accumulated wealth. I mean steal a page from older games and have the intensity scale based upon isk generated/accumulated in a system. Who am I kidding though...
---
Alternatively:
---
You can tweak anom nerfs to work on a logarithmic scale. It wouldn't effect smaller groups as much. There would be a calculable carrying capacity (say that three times fast) to a system so large organized blocs could allocate their systems based upon population easily.
---
No most people sensationalize things without having a full understanding. It’s pretty common
---
Tell me, what kind of moneymaking in eve is not slow?
---
Where's "the government" in Monopoly?
---
Rent seeking absolutely happens without government.  And regulatory capture is the default if there is no government.
---
Have you ever heard of Company Towns?
---
You only have big fleet kills. No solo kills for example. Fleet pvp can be really boring. Maybe try doing smallgang.
---
And I haven't found better pvp game than Eve yet. If you find one plz tell me.
---
happy cake day
---
Loki universal - Tengu with more kinetic dmg.
---
Legion for pve? Neuts for PVE?:D
---
&gt;Way too much content
---
&gt;If you can track them that is.
---
If they are moving around using gates they are easy as hell to track with a ceptor. They warp so slowly compared to interceptors. And a single sabre + few fast frigates on a gate will block their movement / kill most of them so they lose most of their dps. And if your sabre is warp speed rigged then it can follow the bombers really easily and keep bubbling them.
---
&gt; It gets tiring man.
---
It's only tiring if you don't know how to do it effectively and don't have enough eager players to help you hunt them down.
---
Hunting carebears should be risk free
---
Standing fleet per region? Sounds like a weak standing fleet.

You've got issues mate.

---
... did anyone actually ask you, though?
---
Solo pvp then.
---
No. It's just tiring. I'm not dropping everything I'm doing every ten minutes to shoo some pesky bombers twenty hours a day.
---
&gt;Neuts for PVE?:D
---
Neuts for PVE are great! ^(If you want to cap yourself out and die.)
---
Nope they dint and ?
---
That’s boring man
---
I certainly didn't ask him.

The anti tackle fit has a mid slot missing and has the explenation of: 
---
&gt;Note that my particular fit is missing a mid slot. This is intentional and can be filled with any of the following to great effect:  
---
&gt;**Second drone nav comp** – For 10km/s drones and help catching ‘ceptors.  
---
&gt;**Omnidirectional Tracking Link or painter** – To help track frigs even better.  
---
&gt;**Warp Disruptor II**– For even smaller gangs if you need another point.  
---
&gt;**Defensive scram/web** – If you’re worried about being caught.  
---
&gt;**Burst Jammer II** – To remove hostile drone locks or ‘ceptors in a pinch  
---
&gt;**Remote Sensor Dampener** – Because literally anything fits and is useful
---
if you actually read through an artical instead of going straight to the fits then you can get an idea of the reasons why shes fit the VNI these diffrent ways.
---
I have never been in big rich corp, is it usual to happen?
---
He spices his food with silver 1400mm bullets, Capital Multifrequency laserz give him a tan.

i realized that was why it was missing, which is why i didnt give an explanation for that slot
---
And he's doing great job. Hence the appreciation thread...
---
Hmmmm, never noticed the 30/15 mins thing.
---
Nope, T1 will just stay here until you bring some more  to complete and reach the required numbers.
---
Sorry i forgot to add that i think it should only be triggered manually before the citadel is reinforced. But fuck you anyway for downvoting me for trying to engage with you.

No, fuck power creep.

Is it just me or is this looks like a really shitty chandelier?

Totally right. For mining, 1st aim for the Barges (Procurer/Retriever/Covetor) then up your yield skills/mining drones, then go for the Exhumers (Skiff/Mackinaw/Hulk) + crystals/end of yield/buy implants/have an other account/find some mates to have boost (Porpoise/Orca/Rorqual) ==&gt; Enjoy.
---
None around I believe.
---
I don't recall you ever running any successful fleets in PF.

Anyone who has more than 3 cruisers os doing it wrong.

When the guy gets blamed for some other idiot PvPing in a ratting carrier it makes you wonder how legitimate all the other shit talk is.
---
That’s fine and dandy I’m not judging you for that but you think you have the right to judge pve players though let me guess you must be racist too huh ?

Since you think you can bash pve players because what ?your good in solo pvp , bravo well done you rock ! Lol

If you are that low on numbers it's probably does not matter (not true but rather than suggesting to get blingy caps that blobs will take care anyways and you are just feeding their wallets I'd try a different approach), corps with enough assets will evict you regardless. Here is a few things I'd suggest you to do.
---
* anchor enough structures that the eviction would last a week long
---
* timezone tank them
---
* make sure the fittings are correct and cancer (ecm \[not the probe lmbo\] + heavy neuts)
---
* always fuel everything
---
* don't amass wealth as in anchor expensive structures with expensive rigs for no reason
---
* you'll have a kspace static, haul out assets frequently
---
* either fight people or don't, don't tease, don't shittalk and don't be retarded
---
* don't generate expensive lossmails
---
* bash everything down that does not belong to you and grab a few poses that you fuel so you just have to online it in case shit happens
---
* if you are pvp focused start with cheap comps rather than 2b blingy autistic t3cs, feed t1 bcs and bses not those
---
* only anchor structures that you can defend, people will bash your anchoring fortizar but less inclined to do the same with an anchoring athanor, tho if wangspin finds you via your kspace they will bash anything as long as you don't show them an astero then they will just run ((haha dudes did you get my ammo delivery xx-DDD ebyn ))
---
* learn how to do hole control, don't do pve with 8 connections open towards your static or your home
---
* have enough freighters and dsts that you can log everything off in case of emergency
---
* if you end up building caps please don't undock them unless you are actually getting evicted or you'll see people trying to bait you day after day for you to undock it just so they can kill it
---
All in all a well fitted Astrahus can take care of any small scale attackers, at that point you are good to just undock some battleships or whatever comp you want to clear up the field. Very few people want to move into a C2 and unless you give them a good reason to get you, there is nothing to worry about. That being said you can be the first system someone rolls into who has assets and just decides to try to evict you randomly, so there is no bulletproof way.
---
Don't forget the part where Chossuh sent a few dictors to a bunch of rorquals in a different system as bait which caused a bunch of supers to jump to the wrong location resulting in this br:

Sentry drones.
---
Sometimes is, sometimes isn't. Might be worth the try still.
---
Because EVE is set in the future, not some medieval wasteland.
---
There are plenty of other games that cater to your desire to grind exactly the same thing all the time to get numbers to go up.
---
I’m not , I’m complaining about those who think they better because they solo pvp, 
---
I killed a bunch of players and am very aware of the dangers of eve.
---
Killed a whole lot of solo players with my small gang because after all it is still a numbers game.
---
Loki is mostly used because it has non-capacitor dependent DPS, selectable damage types via missiles, and has bonuses to missile application through a missile explosion velocity. Some of the Lokis DPS also comes from drones, so this can be a plus or a minus - lose the drones and you lose valuable DPS; or, use small drones and kill frigates and destroyers while your heavy/heavy assault missiles work on Cruisers and up. It can also be shield or armor tanked depending on the rats you want to fight.
---
Tengu is used because again, non-capacitor dependent DPS and selectable damage types, but its bonuses are to missile range. Tengus, though, are Kinetic-locked for damage bonuses, which makes them ideal for shooting Guristas and Serpentis rats but sub-optimal for shooting Sansha, Blood Raider, or Angel rats. Tengus are also shield ships, which means they can sport a massive tank but you also need to balance out the capacitor use (Do you fit a lower active tank regen but cap stable, or do you fit massive burst regen and not cap stable?).
---
Most PvE Legions are configured to use Heavy or Heavy Assault Missiles for the same reasons stated, but their Assault Optimization subsystem also gives a Drone DPS and HP bonus, making it more reliant on Drone DPS than the Loki - a quarter of their DPS in fact. They have excellent resists against Explosive and Kinetic damage but lack in Thermal and EM, making them good for Angels space. They are always going to be Armor tanked.
---
So to answer your question, it depends on where you want to go and what type of rats you want to shoot.
---
Not even the "extreme" edge cases lol, is it really that weird that I want to take a few days off from time to time or go on a holiday for two weeks without coming back and finding out all my shit is gone?
---
Isn't that the whole point in being in a big alliance. To have the manpower to always have a defense group up so you don't have to do it yourself every time.
---
Whatever your still using it as a discriminatory purpose
---
Totally wasn't anything to do with people vaguely hoping their machine could now play the game in something higher than potato mode without crashing during large fights.
---
Nope we all just wanted to go on a brave new adventure and be trail blazers.
---
Tax Drama is so funny. I think this change is so much fun, traders will undock for the first time in the history and die to multiple alpha tornados.
---
Thanks CCP this is fun.
---
So what DID he do to you then? This bandwagon takes you nowhere.
---
I find scanning and doing exploration in general very therapeutic. 
---
Some people really just.. don’t get it, though. And that’s okay. All we can hope is to steer those along that still have hope as well.
---
What ever your still using it as a discriminatory purpose.
---
Why would someone kill a trader? Empty pod....
---
ur gay pwnd
---
are you in a 0.0% corp? since corp tax takes from your ticks, basically income tax
---
Oh I have , many times but it takes hours , and most time you get killed by fleets if solo eventually, if your staying away and picking your fight carefully using your gate pins etc not feed , 
---
Well you extremely rarely get a 1v1
---
USA was anthropomorphized as a greedy, hook-nosed banker in Soviet propaganda?
---
Do you have any other of your so-called 'facts' that suggest I'm racist?
---
If not, maybe you should consider retracting your statement about me.
---
True but I like eve  , pvp and pve , just don’t think the one is better then the other.
---
Many reasons you say, this minimized 90% of them and pushes the only other ones to true edge cases. And i don't see what the problem is. If the citadel is being attacked and you asset safety your stuff and you defend it you lose access to it for the asset safety timeout. If you don't asset safety it before the citadel is reinforced you have to evac it the old fashioned way. And if you fail to get your stuff out period it drops which means if the attackers don't control the grid it turns into a free for all lootfest.
---
The only situations you could get screwed is if you make the wrong choice (a good reason to lose your stuff) or you lose complete access to the game and internet for aa extended period of like 2 weeks or more. If you decide to stand up and leave one day and never trigger it you lose all your shit, that was a decision you made.
---
EVE has a player-driven economy, so why there are still people's trading fees taxated by fictional npc entities? I wish the npc corp tax also ended up in player hands.
---
That only works if everybody lives in the same solar system. Like a wormhole.
---
Your op paints a VERY different picture.
---
Oh but your wrong I dint call you racist, I only asked that perhaps you might be .
---
A no would have sufficed
---
This is CCP.  Effort involves actually following up on changes, they just throw shit at the wall to see what sticks, and then move on to the next bucket a few weeks later.

When has CCP showed ANY understanding of the effect their shitty changes will have, in the last 5 years?  The most disturbing part is how many people seem to think they're going to magically get it right \*this time\* every time retarded change #24028485023 is announced.

Worst bandwagon ever, I want my money back.
---
No but you are being discriminatory so easily  too so I only asked that perhaps your are a racist too ?
---
Dint even suggested that your a racist like I said ... a simple no answer would have sufficed.
---
We got similar lore information about the blackout.        
---
So lets hope that CCP is actually starting to care again.
---
I mean i am able to do pve plenty to pay for my pvp ships. Have you considered that maybe you are doing it wrong?
---
And your fat ? Maybe your a cat ? Maybe a maggot ? Dunno where you going with this lol 😂
---
It don't have to be huge NPC space.    
---
Lets be honest what we need is a single NPC system (so no one can install a cyno jammer) with bunch of NPC stations.        
---
If it will be also connected to lowsec system - even better.
---
You pay even more tax, it's called the difference between buy and sell price.  The person setting up the order is just calculating it for you.
---
The PVE that we know stands in the way of making EVE a cash cow pay2win garbage game model so the temporary feast that makes those sheep very excited is very convenient.
---
Ofcourse the temporary imbalance generated feast will end and their incompetence in getting the kills they want  will show up again and they will fuel their addiction by spending more and more cash like a gambler, only to ever fail.
---
I don't know where does CCP pull their statistics from but all I've seen is smaller alliances being forced to join big coalitions to survive, disbanding their play style, people mass unsubbing, most of my friends unsubbed, I did the same with my accounts, and we were doing mostly pvp, pve was for sustaining our pvp ships only.
---
Now they want to remove asset safety in null. Do they really want to completely destroy any entity smaller than the few biggest coalitions? They will be all farmed to oblivion with capital fleets.
---
Do they really think they can play that off like something they didn't know would happen?
---

He also saw fit to sit in about every fleet's command chat, backseating people who didn't need the help and then ripping the controls out when *he thought* things might go awry - which, again, is maybe fine if you're, you know, wanted and/or helpful. Nour generally wasn't either of these things. This is more a symptom of FCON in specific and nullbloc middle-management hellscapes in general, but Nour was a brilliant microcosm of it.
---
He'd also get after skirmish FCs for taking out roams and feeding (wow, not the ruptures - anything but those) while simultaneously meatgrindering against PL every single day exactly as they'd hoped. (This wasn't a behavior exclusive to him either, by the by, but essentially the entire "Skyteam" sans Sergon).
---
It's late and I can't be bothered to untangle more repressed memories of the PFED discord in its months prior to combustion, and honestly I have a hard time remembering if any one bad experience is tied to Nour or the other loud ragelord, Khan, but, you know, I have my reasons.
---
Are you so naive to believe that he just spent 5 years in Kubinen and not doing something else in EVE?
---
Finally someone that gets it ! Brings real contexts to the table , 
---
I salute you friend!
---
Keep zkill on 24 hour delay as an archive of kills primarily, with esi based stuff (mainly for background checking) non-existant.
---
Ha gold
---
It could even be an implant that delays lossmails.
---
This sounds like something they're very likely to completely fuck up.
---
All pun intended :D
---
What are you even saying ?
---
Suck dick in eve really?
---
All you seem to be able to teach is toxicity!
---
:Pepeclown:
---
i dont disagree.
---
Are you, really, really high?
---
Oh I remember that guy. He was once in our coalition with jintan and once he lost his shit really bad and started screaming
---
Pve players are killing eve. Go back to bdo if you dont like that.
---
And remove one of the biggest isk sinks? Hello inflation my name is lusciusUta.

Retard
---
No I want you to focus on the pve vs pvp debate and not get lost in the comparison of a racist or not.
---
I think it’s the other way around you are the one that fears being a racist so much that you have to prove to me that your not ,while in reality it doesn’t even matter to me if you are or not , 
---
Like I said a simple no would have sufficed.
---
* In the launcher, it would be useful to see character names next to the account names. I often forget which character is on each account.
---
* In station/citadel I want a one-click "repair all" button. The repair cost could be a tooltip on hover.
---
* Autopilot waypoints - I want to be able to set the same location more than once in my route.
---
* Be able to instantly repackage station containers!
---
Dude you would have no pvp if it weren’t for pve players , what you think the magic faerie build your ship ? 
---
How dumb are you ?
---
Part of me is thinking that what they need to do is limit asset safety. Anything with a jump drive doesn't benefit from it.
---
Not all old stations have been unanchored yet. However flagging characters that haven't been logged in for x period of time for auto-asset-safety might be a solution.
---
No
---
I don't recall PF ever running any successful fleets.
---
I did steal the fit off of Spartan, I think!
---
You realise how young he was right? Most people liked him despite his flaws John. He was for the most part well received and he wasn't unaware of these things. I didn't have a problem with you. He doesn't have a problem with you. Do you know how frustrating it is to have to deal with the shit decisions made from up top and then to have the tarnished name of FCON associated with solely you wherever you go. He was never as full of himself as you think he was and he never thought he was always right believe me. And it doesn't seem like he ever did anything to you specifically and yet you're treating him just as every friend I had in Tri treated me just for being associated with FCON when they went to war. Do you know how toxic that is? He loses less shit than a lot of other FCs. Does better than most he's not amazing by any means don't get me wrong. But years after and people still think he whelps everything and calls him the worst FC they've ever seen when it's completely untrue and everybody knows it. Half the FCs out there are more cancerous now than he ever was. I don't know why you feel the need to be like this man it's just a dick thing to do. Fuelling the hate mob to make someone else's time eternally miserable. His own alliance is shit talking him for some other idiot jumping a ratting carrier into a bomber fleet. How unfair is that? I'm trying hard to be reasonable on reddit here. Reddit.
---
Mongs that feed shitfit ratting ships don't build anything
---
Falcon is an asshat.

It has more tank than TEST's doctrine Nid, atleast there's that.

why is this bad for the game? if u want your assests to be safe just stay in npc station

If you follow reddit all day then yeah. That's what you're going to believe. It doesn't help that the alliance would ban you for arguing on reddit. 'Because we're better than that' or some shit.

You think people wont gank pod? How long u are hidding in wormhole?:D

Warp disrupt is 24 standard, longer with faction and heat.

Which is his YouTube channel? Eveiseasy does not have many videos. Or does he mainly stream?
---
1. Keep all spare capitals in NPC stations      
---
2. Jump out all heavier stuff before structure dies.        
---
3. If you got hit by a car and laying in hospital - well shit to be you. You get punished for not playing the game!

Fuck this kind of approach, seriously.

All that happened was your rock solid safety was shaken up a *little bit*. You talk about people being entitled but you don't even understand the entire fucking communities and in-game culture that got decimated to make room for your pve safe havens. You're the selfish one here. You don't even understand how many of the many types of play styles had to get nerfed to shit to enable the new eden you feel entitled to to exist. 
---
Meanwhile, in the period of time ccp was only concerned with catering to you player count nosedived and multiboxing skyrocketed, hollowing out the game from the inside. So don't talk about selfishness, you don't give a fuck about how ccp treated the rest of the playerbase but you get one significant nerf and you're ready to climb up on the fucking cross. Get over yourself. Btw, spodbrained nullbears would be nowhere near a "majority" (I'd like to see numbers on that) if ccp hadn't run off most of the original fan base of the game to cater to you. 
---
The problem is there aren't as many of you as ccp thought there'd be when they decided to chase the fortnight demographic. Turns out that no matter how much you simplify and defang the game it'll always be too complicated for casuals to make up a significant number of players, versus the actual original fan base that was pretty damn rock solid over more than a decade until the empire building era came. You're right, this is a business decision. When they threw us under the bus for you they thought they'd gain more overall players, they didn't. Now they realize we're worth more than you and they want us back. Good. When eve was a pvp game it had double the population, it was a totally different game. So unironically fuck your iteration of players, there's better pve games out there anyway.
---
Looking for Albion Online Guild
---
inb4 they will drop in abyssal space xD
---
I wonder if we could correlate the population death spiral to pro pve null game changes over the last three years? :thonking:
---
or they can create the service module for skin on each citadel, and you can install skin in there.
---
I want to love EVE. The music is FANTASTIC. 
---
The isolation of space fits my personality. 
---
My perspective is this... there is too much PVP for PVE players to become PVP. It is unbalanced that introverts, such as i, cannot slowly come to fruition and become formidable player's. 
---
There is not enough protection in highsec, still, that allows more casual player to elevate, and become the next generation. I do not know the solution but i know the problem: crime is not treated with the proper consequence's that could allow such a slower play style ,such as myself, to become educated in all the fascinations of equipment to defend ourselves and venture out into lowsec.
---
fuck-off-war effect?
---
Did i say there shouldnt be any pve? I iust said pve players are the bottom of the food chain and none of their requests should be taken into consideration by devs. If some quit then fine, the other will slave away for a little bit more isks so tue rest of us can have fun
---
That is very true.  
---
Im pvp player and im using zkill, and dotlan statistics a lot to check how many ppl jumping through system, and what kind of ship specific player are flyin, if hes flying solo or with friends, etc. And most of the time it helps me to know if i can engage or not.  
---
They are powerful intel services that cutting solo, and smaller gang pvp.
---
Legion is more support ship then a good PVE platform. Low range, not enough tank. Maybe lazor fit could work on drones.
---
Nike
---
Blackout is not the problem, last sunday Goons took over 200bill in raw moon goo in under 2 hours during a locust fleet, this happens on a regular basis.
---
Neither did she, hence the eyepatch.
---
I heared PL is recruiting.
---
Next step? Civil war!
---
I dunno, you're the person that went after me simply for suggesting that his name brought back some less than pleasant memories, which were much more fueled by the same bureaucratic shit-show you mention he hated than by any individual including him. Like I said, I don't think he's a terrible person, I don't think he's even a terrible FC. He just rubbed me quite the wrong way in FCON and never really made up for it.
---
I'm sure he has changed now. I'm sure he doesn't have a problem with me, because I doubt he even remembers me. Until this post, I didn't really remember him, either. But what I did eventually remember was him being generally an all-around ass, even for EVE standards, and not much else. 
---
As for everything else...well, this is Reddit. People beat dead memes into the ground until long after they've been reduced to paste. That's nothing especially new.
---
I'm not really arguing any of that. I'm just saying it can do more than neut.
---
Don't forget about road tax!
---
&gt; all the black rise fuckery
---
What is that?
---
They got a fucking rorq. I think its enough attention for the first 15 years of eve and for the next 15 years also
---
Your flair game is strong Sticky ;)
---
That's in delve though. I'm talking about having to move all those rorqs across the map every few months
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cjoi5f/esibased_fogofwar_coming/
---
What's the problem then? if you have 100bn then you shouldn't care what is the most efficient you should just do something that you find fun and don't care if you die doing it. That's what i do now and i don't have anywhere close to 100bn in assets.
---
As someone who used to run with FEDUP back in the day, I can honestly say that this whole AAR is amusingly believable. Glad to see you scrubs are still out there causing trouble :)
---
I got into my current WH Corp by getting ganged by them, I asked about the kill  and the fit he used to catch my astero. He linked me to their public chat after talking for a bit. Been in for about a month now, great group of players. WH space best space, I’m all about the holes ;) 
---
One thing is for sure If you have very little knowledge of WH space, the best way to me is to jump right in! Grab an astero, do some relic/data sites in A C1-C3 and hunt other site runners! FYI, the pve in WH Is great. Can roll holes and crab all day. Just have to pay attention to new signatures!

lol, im just curious  which program can display nicknames on top of the screen. It's just convenient. And i only know EVE-O.
---
Zkill is a nice place to get fits from, bad idea.
---
both are sources of content Creation. Yes you get fog of war, Long term there needs to be some kind of skill based intelligence tools, In my opinion this information should be delayed not removed.
---
&gt; Yeah what kind of an asshat picks on us for trucking 20 lightyears up to fucking orvolle to try to shit on the corp of these lowsec fanbois we kicked, after they butthurted one of our krabs and had the AUDACITY to tether on our citadel cuz we bigbrained the acls.
---
&gt; Thankfully i can get my alliance to downvote, then get daddy silver to try and PR this so its all cool and we dont look even more like shitters
---
You cant spin the spinmaster buddo.
---
I would go with something cheaper to maintain until you have more experience. A drake or myrmidon are good choices. Plus they can use a MJD to get out of trouble.
---
Is that all you got? you Mad Bro?
---
Miners don't pay any tax.
---
Wh's get less busy the high up the class you go, C4 's are the norm for PvP homes, C5/6 will mostly be farm holes.
---
Carry several mobile depots.
---
If using rapid lights, overheat and repair whilst reloading.
---
Understand the purpose of the ship you are going to engage, are they a drone boat, what will their resist profile look like, what damage should you be dealing. 
---
Know when to try disengage.
---
Always gf in local, never shit talk in local.
---
Use cheap or insurable ships, makes a loss less painful when climbing the learning curve.
---
you have never reprocessed your ore, or sold it, or ... literally done anything w/ it at all
---
Love reading me some Sons AAR's.
---
Keep it up Saucy.
---
I don't mine ... but i usually buy ore using direct contracts ... so no taxes for miners.
---
I can actually see this working out. A lot of hunters find their prey the easy way, through systems with NPCs killed in the last 24h/pilots currently undocked in system etc instead of actually going and... looking for them.
---
&gt;Miners don't pay any tax.      
---
&gt;I don't mine ...      
---
I rest my case 
---
^also ^what ^are ^contract ^fees ^?
---
https://i.imgur.com/DSgrVKs.jpg
---
10.000 isk in fees &lt;3
---
Apparently Twitter &gt; Reddit for info
---
Who the hell triple reps?
---
&gt;10-20 tanked to the teeth capitals are what you normally get dropped on you tho.
---
I feel like this is an exceptional exaggeration.
---
We hit salt Farmers so hard in a trap structure bash that they literally disbanded. Baited their dreads, counter dropped, and wiped out their entire capital fleet.
---
Just add skinned keepstars as their own items, that's how shipskins used to work too so it's not like that would be anything new.
---
Is this like when total pvp damage from battle-cruisers was deemed to be in a good place, because of highsec suicide ganking?
---
Can't confirm. We hear the snuff pet thing so the time. We def like them more than goons or any other major power, but we ain't blue.
---
and what happens to the ore then? do you look at it, do you eat it, do you throw it away?    
---
you still need to repro it and that costs money. you end up paying the miners taxes
---
Firesales were always fun, decent spoils of war mechanic too
---
Why the fuck are there so many attention seekers on r/eve lately?
---
What recently would put you off? Industrialist, blackout should mean more things die so more to sell? :D   
---
Obvs market things are a big of a worry.
---
Or they just did their job and left FW, as well as Goons FW corp.
---
I actually feel better about the tax changes when I see this. Poor little dude worked over by taxes.
---
Refine at citadel?        
---
0% tax
---
They no longer exist.
---
Delete zkill.
---
FCKING COLORED ICONS. Sorry was I screaming?
---
And while at it maybe lose the minimalist shit overview icons and have.. you know.. icons that don't look alike so I can tell a dread from a fax without staring hard.
---
Simply suggesting his name alone brought back unpleasant memories? Perhaps you're wrong and you're the one being the ass. He didn't constantly whelp to PL you know that's a lie. You don't even seem to know if it was FCON or Nour you disliked. He remembers you. Or do you just not give a fuck in which case that explains everything. The supposed shit FC had way more friends than you did just saying.
---
Someone's never been to delve. [This was an extremely lightweight response, and we brought our own carrier.](https://zkillboard.com/related/30004756/201905110000/)
---
Just shut down both. 
---
Optional: In addition to that  CCP implements their own solution of both services.
---
They said taxes were going to 5% when cits were introduced, but only did 2-3% initially to reduce the shock to the system. This has been in the pipeline for literally years.
---
Deep nullsec is already aids, and you want to make it more aids for actual people who do things aside from run ratting bots? (Who, btw, have a bunch of VNIs - now Dommis)
---
BTW, X-3 is 3 mids to a stain station with a JF and 2 to a curse station, by my estimation. Not like it matters, as to get established out there you're probably going to need JF logistics out which means you have JF logistics back.
---
Its a terrible place to do indy(Moving inputs in and outputs out to market would be straight aids) and a terrible place to stage for PVP. The only reason to go out there is to rat, rat, rat. 
---
Asset safety at least gives you some reason to leave some ships to defend it with when someone inevitably comes knocking with a force you cannot combat, such that you can go down swinging.
---
I think it was a c2..
---
What would you recommend? I usually go there to gas huff with my venture and gila to do sites and clear the gas site after 15m(i have 2 account). Is a drake able to solo c2 sites ?
---
I still havent use mobile depots..isnt there the risk of the wh collapse and losing all loot?
---
thats on the corp running a 0% tax then (see my original comment)
---
Then stop acting like one.       
---
We both know what will happen in only specific groups can hold structures.        
---
Nullsec is not a WH space you can move always force to some system.                  
---
Also no mechanic split between nullsec/lowsec/wh.
---
Which is what happens on a bi-weekly basis...
---
Delve isn't reflective of most Eve combat situations though. 
---
Goons are notorious for dropping the kitchen sink on everything that moves. Titan gatecamps exist, but they're far from the norm either.
---
Because in this game we went to space to run from taxes in the first place..
---
I think you FEEL that solo PvP players think they are better, that brings up a victim mentality on YOUR part.
---
Because most of the stuff he got pilloried for wasnt his idea, he was just the face.
---
Why can’t people keep a reasonable amount of goods in a single citadel?
---
Why should they get an instant out for making a mistake of putting all of their eggs in one basket?
---
Why should the enemy who had the skill and numbers to take down said citadel with everyone’s assets be denied the loot they earned?
---
I understand where you’re coming from, but it sounds like a cop out and appeal to emotion to me.
---
If losing a single citadel costs you “everything you worked for” and if it does, it’s no different then the retard who puts everything he owns into a single bestower and gets clapped in jita.
---
Why doesn’t he get his stuff put into a citadel rather then drop?
---
If you want me to focus on the 'pve vs pvp debate' then why did you suggest that someone -- who was debating -- was racist? Basically, I don't believe you want to debate at all. I think you just resort to insults when someone disagrees with you. 
---
If you want me to focus on the 'pve vs pvp debate' then *go debate the idea*, don't try to make people look bad. That doesn't make your ideas look good. It does the exact opposite.
---
If you tackle a rorqual it's not an exaggeration that you could have 10 or more caps dropped on you if you actually threaten to kill said rorqual. Not just in goon space but any space where they can operate an umbrella.
---
I wouldn't recommend it. Finding a high class wormhole is pretty much luck dependent. You might find one in 10 minutes and you might as well not find any in an hour. Also these wormholes are often farmed by people who live in them, so it's another dice roll whether there will be anything worthwhile left to huff.
---
So a miner mine ore, contract it to me and pays 10.000 isk, then i move it at desired location and refine in private structure with 0% tax.                
---
Miners don't pay taxes.            
---
If someone buy something and refine at some structure with tax - this person pays the tax not the miner.
---
Why don’t they just not keep all their shit in one station?
---
The amount of downvotes to reasonable comments like yours is showing how pissed off and scared null is about losing asset safety.
---
Based on this assumption bounties on the NPC should be also issued by players.            
---
We are not there yet.....
---
Everyone would break up every thing into smaller corps, I’m not 100% up on the skills fro running a corp, but people in a position of having many skillfarmed toons would train and use them, further putting power in the hands of people with many accounts.
---
They will slave away for what?
---
The only ones that will slave away are the ones like you, smashing those credit cards like pickaxes.
---
It's already completely cancer to create content in this game for anymore than 20 people at a time - I'm all for more danger and conflict, but if the side effect of this results in putting barriers up that make it harder for content creators, this game is over honestly.  
---
Remember pre citadels/pre fozzie sov when you could shoot a structure and get a fight? shocking concept I know.
---
Is there way to show the public courier contracts with other third party app or site?
---
DATS WAYCIST
---
Actually something to consider. I mean, you can still dock.
---
' I can understand getting my ships destroyed because of my mistakes or bad decisions ' -&gt; then just consider your ships destroyed because you made the mistake of putting them in a player controlled station.
---
Fraaaaaans I miss you!
---
Shields aren’t op on a unfueled POS, why should a station have tethering if it’s not being maintained?
---
The fact you’re getting downvoted for speaking the truth, shows how tilted and scared nullsec is about losing asset safety
---
&gt;Simply suggesting his name alone brought back unpleasant memories? Perhaps you're wrong and you're the one being the ass.
---
The name of a prominent member in the FC team I interacted with regularly did, in fact, remind me of all my experiences I had in that coalition. The human brain might just surprise you.
---
&gt;He didn't constantly whelp to PL you know that's a lie.
---
I mean, basically everyone who ran a strat-op level fleet against PL did. That's not really my point, my point is that I distinctly remember times where he'd then join with the skyteam and shit on lower-level fleets for feeding after he ate hot shit hours earlier. I didn't care about the losing so much as the hypocrisy.
---
&gt;You don't even seem to know if it was FCON or Nour you disliked.
---
Por que no los dos?
---
&gt;Or do you just not give a fuck in which case that explains everything.
---
Well, obviously I give some level of fuck, hence why I'm still posting.
---
&gt;The supposed shit FC had way more friends than you did just saying.
---
Glad to hear it.
---
Concord is already saving trillions per month with the blackout, why should they need additional funding?? 
---
Something isn't right here!
---
Haha, I don't get ganked but I also don't fit tank on my barges. Covetor all the way.
---
This is not a question, I’m afraid.
---
And with what the developers said recently, they are aiming at adding even more insecurity feelings, and forced PVP. The game won’t fit to your personal views, and the sooner you accept it, the better.
---
And what would you propose to actually "treat the crime the proper way", as you said ?
---
Slave away for isk.
---
I agree and this is something rarely talked about
---
Agree on this, but it could be frustrating for hunters. However given the benefit of no local, I think it’s a fair trade off
---
You might be too far away of any FOB to detect them. Try using a longer range filter, or move around the cluster.
---
You might want to ask some people that actively run them, maybe they’ll be kind enough to share their intel on FOB placements ?
---
This. It removes also the problem of the excessively aggressive player that just wants to boast about a green killboard, instead of using focused aggression as a means to better roleplay goals, such as protecting or conquering space, contesting resources, or even vengeance. Killboards promote ganking, which is a waste of testosterone.
---
Tbh when CCP introduce mooring ^(like working one) we can remove tether in favor of typical station undock and aggro mechanics.             
---
Aka you can dock if you are at 0 , pointed but without aggression.
---
No.
---
Then krab alliances will do ESI checks on characters to make sure they have the implant on their active jump clone.
---
Wow, gate camps finally took their toll.
---
It depends. What kind of SKINs do you have ? Might interest some people here.
---
And yeah, it also depend on the hull, the looks and the rarity of said SKIN. The Exoplanet Hunter is trash, for example. But if you have a Capital ship SKIN, so long that it’s not the EH, you can be sure you’ll sell it for a lot. Also apply to SKINs that could be obtained only with IRL events.

Inb4 a second wave of bitter salty players
---
Lack of targets.
---
I left the game suddenly in 2008 because of homelessness, I was just happy my stuff existed, I was all in a outpost, now a fortizer.
---
Now I live in jspace, I don’t keeping I’m not using in NPC stations, wherever I go or do I will act as if asset safety is not a thing, because if it where up to me, I’d remove it from all null-sec citadels.
---
Fmercury warping that gank night fleet?, that's a name from the past. I had him in qotsa for a while and he decided leave us and go full -10. He did it in less than 10 seconds by joining a hisec mining fleet, joining voice comms and bringing in a smart bomb geddon . There was a video but I think it got lost many years ago.
---
Nah, elite *lite*.
---
This line gets spouted a lot but caring about a green killboard is for russians and the year 2010. Killboards are a good measure of PvP activity though, and most corporations that ask for them use it to verify said activity.
---
I'm honestly a little torn between these. Zkill blackout was great, basically every character was a threat because you couldn't just go check if he is a pubbie or has a hic with cyno on killboard. 
---
Dotlan/the ingame map however I'm not sure about. New Eden is large, there are lots of systems and also lots of empty space. Without a way to find activity it could get frustrating to hunt and just not find anything outside of delve and esoteria. Would for sure be interesting to see how it affects hunting.
---
you're retarded
---
no really, you're one of the dumbest posters here
---
Unless there is some juicy drama or CSM related stuff we are not aware of.      
---
/u/olmeca_gold care to share?              
---
Like honestly if this is due to blackout (aka no afk camping, people not using excavators) it could be nice to have input from a multiboxer about how he see this change in nullsec.
---
/r/eve &gt; everything
---
No i just play with you &lt;3            
---
^(if you haven't noticed this like few months ago already)
---
This, so much this. I for one love preparing for an engagement and completely removing ways of gathering intel (via, say, Dotlan) would really be detrimental to my playstyle. Nothing against a delayed zKillboard though!
---
D-did you reply to your own thread?
---
pretending to be retarded is apparently epic trolling, good job
---
That's just a bad example. I suppose you can also say my mistake is buying the ships in the first place as well.
---
Check your pms

I feel like I've done pretty much everything that I set out to do when I first started, I've run out of goals to achieve and I can't find any worth while ones to pursue in the current iteration of the game.
---
Have you played The Settlers ?       
---
The first part?
---
If there was juicy drama in that alliance Olmeca probably needs his head checked.
---
On the other hand, I always wondered if my alts are planning to awox me...
---
But that isn't in range for (most of) dronelands iirc.
---
Be happy your stuff wasn’t in a Hard Knocks  keepstar
---
you can time every citadel to the exact same time so it takes a group 230482 man hours to clear space
---
You can still be a rabid murderbot if you want, you just, as you said, find a reason, other than pushing a number up like an addict. *looks at my net worth graph in jassets*
---
Fairly sure snarky unearned resentment and throwing shade was your point. Don't know why people feel the need to pretend otherwise if you want to be an arse hole just be an arse hole.
---
Just in case i keep my own on the biomass timer from time to time - just to remind them how they will end up if they try something.
---
What a glorius idea !
---
Bout bloody time.
---
  Players demanded jump fatigue. They answered.
---
  Players demanded almost no fatigue. They answered.
---
  Players hated dominion sov. They answered
---
  Now players want dominion sov.
---
  Players demanded rorq upgrades for use in null
---
  Now players want them removed.
---
  Eve players are actually bipolar.
---
whats been on my mind? people dont need silly blackouts and mechanic changes. the age of chaos has been within us all along.
---
Why not remove them entirely? It's not like there aren't too many people doing PvE, and w-space and abyssal space give you ways to earn good income through PvE despite NPCs there not having bounties.
---
Wait you want to say that all your posts were serious?!            
---
Like ... wtf?       
---
You are trolling or not now?
---
There was indeed, however, those posters were far far more blatant [https://i.imgur.com/3DOWsGN.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/3DOWsGN.jpg)
---
Got nothing there m8
---
Manticore has 4 mid slots. I use these. No Web.
---
* 2x Target Painter
---
* 1x AB or MWD
---
* 1x Warp Scram
---
You often need a CPU implant to use this set up.
---
Because that's a *remarkably* stupid idea?
---
But do we want more baskets? Structure spam is bad enough as is...
---
I vote 100% for no asset safety, but u are right.
---
Some thoughts
---
1. No structure can be wrecked down at once, so as someone who has goods in it has enough time to pack ur bags and move on.
---
2. There should be a new function that when ur docking rights to a station are removed u still can get stuff via remote hanger, like the one we have for delievering a contract.
---
3. If u have so much goods in it that u will be not able to move u are probably a station trader and should be hidden by that new mechanic. As a station trader u are one of the reason that inflation grows too fast in this game. So thats new to u. Now station trader will have a risk in this game. Like all the other.
---
In that case you're still paying a tax. That tax is the time, effort, and risk you take in moving large quantities of ore to a station whose services you can use without being taxed. This tax, though invisible to people who don't bother to take the time to quantify it, really can add up depending on your circumstances.
---
I usually use Torps + dual Target Painters, but I fancy giving this a try so I can free up the 2 slots the Painters use.
---
You know what is a better measure of PvP activity? When you recognize the name of the corp or alliance gang that you just spotted and are filled with glee or fear, based on if you want a good fight or gotta run/hide/hope they don’t bash your stations.
---
Stainguy saying something we all can agree with.
---
I endorse this comment
---
like i said, you're retarded
---
Or it's different people asking for the changes. When people are content they're not on forums complaining.
---
Uh....your rapid lights should hit out to at least 27 km, and if you use augmented drones, he'll have a really tough time killing them.
---
&gt;I docked  2 of my ships at a player owned base because I was in a hurry 
---
&gt;Why must I pay with my time and ISK for things beyond my control?
---
&gt;used to work  
---
&gt;not like that would be anything new
---
These are not necessarily mutually inclusive. It's highly likely the old code for handling SKINs like that is long gone and largely incompatible with current SKIN tech. CCP would have to rewrite a lot of code to make that work, which goes back to my main point that CCP has said it is difficult to implement a solution, though I do think they're still working on it.
---
Actually you are wrong.        
---
This is not tax, it is just how some activities are designed to work in game.       
---
Eg. this is how mechanics works.
---
I really wish they'd talk to like actual content creators and not just the r/eve circlejerk.
---
I don't like the way "risk" is being discussed. Information is a big part of it for sure, but the real risk is still the obscene proliferation of capitals and supercapitals and the freeness with which they are used. It's the fact if you want to make an offensive play you have to do it against someone who has a lot more people, a lot bigger toys, _and_ right in their backyard usually far from the nearest NPC station.
---
The information on Dotlan is almost exclusively only useful offensively, if you nerf that you're only hurting people trying to make things happen (and thus buffing the very kind of null sec groups blackout was supposed to hurt).
---
When I look up a toon on zkill I'm looking at the first couple pages even if that goes back 3 years, not what they did 20 minutes ago. So delayed killmails achieves almost nothing from that perspective.
---
Blackout is cool and I'm glad they're keeping it, but I just don't agree that availability of information is EVE's biggest problem and even if it was Dotlan/zkill wouldn't be where to start.
---
Tbh sure ... let me firs sell some stuff, i have like 1T in assets.
---
Tethering should be a separate Service Module. If you want it, pay the fuel bill to have it!
---
Don't do loyalanon on me bud.
---
He inspired me to get a more crazy idea, what if CCP shut down Eve servers completely? No local, no dotlan, no zkillboard best Fog of War evah!!!
---
Zkill is what CCP should already have in their game. Lots of people like a “scoreboard” of sorts. Maybe delaying it but removing it would be a massive disappointment for the community.
---
After being reinforced they go to low power.... would that stop tethering too?
---
How easy supers/titans are to produce and store.
---
I hate it that not enough players solo pvp with normal nonfaction frigates in lowsec, like 5 jumps away from my staging... please dudes, undock in rifters, atrons, tristans and sell your succubuses, garmurs and worms..  you will get more fights... at lease I will forever deny content to faction frigates
---
Good idea !
---
No you made a decision to put them somewhere, with the open knowledge of what would happen to them. There was risk to the reward of instantly safing them up.
---
You have a few options now. You can go pick them up. With the risk that the station is camped.
---
You can pay some one else to move them. Put the collat at their true value, if they die you grt new ships from a trade hub
---
You can sell them right where they are.
---
Honestly, if its two ships... just sell em there (or.insure and SD them) and buy a new one. Use it to make isk to pay back the loss on the second one.
---
Something about their recent actions makes me think they want more of our money
---
So when should CCP stop listening if it's forever going to be back and forth until the game finally shuts down?
---
But where will theur latest mobile game run on?
---
The following should apply for low power structures.
---
* No tethering -  you want tethering, keep it fueled.
---
* No reinforcement timers - you want timers, keep it fueled.
---
* No damage cap or reduced damage cap - you want resists etc, keep it fueled.
---
* No asset safety - you want asset saefty, keep it fueled.
---
If you're going afk, move your stuff to an NPC station and accept the consequences of your floating space debris going bang due to its lower power state.
---
okay so that already generally happens. For example, if I see a TEST stiletto in Delve I know that there's a roam fleet going around, or if I see a Smile n' Wave tag in a Novice plex I know that it's bait and they have a few cloaked up asteros in there.
---
I'm more talking about two other things - recruit screening and preserving/maintaining a record of skirmishes, battles, and wars. None of these things require a real-time updated Killboard, which is why I support a delayed/archival style dump of data.
---
It should be removed.
---
It's far too overpowered that someone can put an expensive ship on a tether ring as a bait, pretend to be afk and be gunning the citadel with an alt. Remove all structures make the item hanger only able to hold 350m3 of items, and one capital ship in all of assets. 
---
There have I got super gay enough for you gaylords?
---
Or people can keep value in their wallets, or in high/low stations.
---
If people wanna drop more citadels fine.
---
But then cop sends the new guys over and smacks some citadels
---
Awwwww so cute
---
No mate... The ferox is butt-ugly
---
Its quiet to quiet goons must be up to something....
---
15% off PLEX? Yes, please.
---
Not all but it would at least give some, only other way would be create even more systems in that area or have npc's take over some systems which would piss off sov holders for sure especially if it didn't happen in other areas.
---
Id say you want at least 2 gb of ram for each client you want to run. A core/thread for each client would also be very beneficial. Gpu is not that important, a midrange gpu should work fine, depending on how many monitors and what resolution you run at
---
Time to list off what you've done, so we can offer suggestions!
---
Take my up vote sir. After asset safety gone. It's like loot piñatas in wh.
---
this dude thinks PvP is boring? what world does he live in?    
---
Like i am a fuckin krab and i still get the itch to PvP for the rush it gives, whether it be in fleet or ganking some unsuspecting fellow Krab, we are cannibalistic after all.
---
You are aware that is a roleplaying news article and not a patch note or anything?
---
Lemme guess, you think ore that you mine is free, right?
---
Sorry but i highly doubt implementing an exact copy of an existing item that only uses different ressource files for it's visual design takes much rewriting for how things in the game work in general.  
---
How skins used to work wasn't "skin tech", something like a Quafethron was just it's own unique ship.  
---
It is not difficult to implement this, it's just not worth the effort to add a new item for every skin that needs rules for interaction with other things and update everything else to interact correctly with said item.
---
TBH that looks pretty quiet and placid.
---
Also old laser sounds. Right now pulse lasers sound like some poor Minmatar slave is just flipping the light switch in rapid succession for the pulse laser.
---
Or a part of your ship falls of
---
One year later... They all so slow for providing proper changes without disturbing players enjoyment.
---
Farmers don't pay tax on the potatoes they pull out of the ground. They pay tax on the money they get for selling them. 
---
I want to say your point still stands, because mining alts create value. But the taxation still happens at the point of exchanging Ore for ISK, or minerals for ISK. 
---
But what if I were to build ships, modules, and ammo with ore I mine and refine myself? Should I be taxed on that? Yes. I should be taxed when I sell it. Should I be taxed if I *don't* exchange it for ~~ISK~~ another item of value? Let me answer that with another question. 
---
If you grow your own food, make your own clothing, and otherwise live without acquiring any money whatsoever, should you be paying tax?
---
No this is dumm idea. Got  better one.
---
Make low power structures to subside in 7 days and everything stored in it to be handled by loot fairy.
---
&gt;How skins used to work wasn't "skin tech"  
---
&gt;current SKIN tech
---
You're right, it wasn't.
---
I'll concede your point, but as you admit this solution requires a lot of effort to add dozens of new structures with all the requisite interactions, all for a system which is reduced in function compared to the traditional SKIN system.
---
Oh I know, but 48 Mobile Tractor units spamming my dscan just isn't pleasant...
---
Since when can you cloak in a plex?
---
I see traders getting ganked in unfit industrials on zkill all the time
---
Nothing has ever stopped you or any other pvper from undocking and looking for a fight. Sad thing is, you lot insist on harassing the pve crowd because it's an easy kill, and the majority of pvpers out there won't fight unless they are guarunteed a win.
---
I lost count of the amount of times I've literally chased away small gangs that have come to drop on pvers who refuse to fight an equal opponent. How is that fair?
---
This is how it should be.
---
They go low power after the second timer, which is in the timezone chosen by the defenders.
---
Losing the ability to tether until the final timer would make the second timer more important (and provide the ability to shut down tethering on undefended structures for longer), so we would probably see more fights after the initial reinforce.
---
I'd say that's a good thing.
---
I agree...but you can kill faction with t1 frigates
---
it's not placid, it's delve
---
Pyfa has this built in, you can set resists to specific factions weapons or ammo types. So you can instantly figure out what your ship, fit and skills do in specific situations.
---
What obligation does your enemy have to fight you fairly?
---
Appears that you have a predictable enemy, that can be exploited.
---
Capitals have a range they can jump based on the system they jump from. if you dont want or cant deal with those caps, then maybe change your area?
---
How about shutting down hilmar? Might work even better in long term.
---
whahahahaha sure we have all our ships in hsec...dude stop just stop
---

They are fucking baller ships if you want to spend like 30b or so
---
and the player you need to lookout for is the crasy dude in a corm.. hes out for blood
---
Hahhaha i was just fucking with ya men when i recognised your name ;)
---
either filter them or probe them down and shoot them
---
I'd agree with this. Tether as a mechanic is there as a replacement for POS forcefields. If a POS is offline, it's got no forcefield and can be killed in one go. There's no reason a low power citadel should work differently, if you want tether/reinforcement, keep it fueled.
---
players: free intel is bad! 
---
CCP: we are removing free intel.
---
Players: but... but... content creators!!!!
---
By limiting it however you don't completely screw the person over. 
---
Removing asset safety is wrong to me. There's simply too much blob out there for it to be viable and "in days of old" your assets got locked away but you could still convert them back to ISK or extract them with some effort (ignoring deadzoning).
---
Your market scenario is another prime example why some element of asset safety needs to be retained.
---
Blanket asset safety however is also bad, particularly at an individual level. There's a balance somewhere with making sure you can comfortably keep all of your doctrine stuff in staging despite living in a world of cynos and just accumulating so much that loss becomes meaningless.
---
Now how to balance that? I have no one true answer. Part of the reason why "anything with a jump drive doesn't asset safety" makes sense is because they are relatively mobile and so can be moved to safety with much less effort than, say, trying to move all of a corporations assets. Any system you can create will have outliers. To answer your point 3), CCP customer support has been compassionate in the past. CCP can give them leeway if there's suitable documentation. Though yeah that makes "if it dropped we aren't reimbursing it" a problem which can't/shouldn't be fixed either.
---
Shhh, there is 48 of them, I'm not done scanning the last ones yet. Keep eyes on Zkill.
---
[since always](https://i.imgur.com/dsXsXl7.png)
---
Serenity didn’t have esi or api stuff, go ask Chinese what happened in there
---
Let me again put the example.       
---
You put up trade hub -&gt; then take all docking access, shut down all services. Unanchor it few seconds before DT.           
---
There is to many ways people can and will abuse it.
---
Holy hell...why have i never done this. Thank you
---
its really not a ton, looks like 1 corp mining a moon or two lmao
---
Turning existing systems into NPC space? Sure, whatever. But the last thing this game needs is more systems. There's plenty already, especially now that 1 system can supply many more people than it did in the past (Remember having to warp from asteroid belt to belt to fight NPCs?)
---
Would you complain if you'd put them in someone else's POS and they got nicked as well?
---
You have to accept the risk of using someone else's citadel, rather than an NPC station. #dealwithit
---
lets break something that has worked epicly for over a decade and is the go to tool for eve and give it to ccp devs that fix stuff like the local
---
WHen they talk to veterans, people complain the game is being made for a faraway minority who doesnt play the way most people do.
---
When they talk to average players people complain the advice is going to be bad and it wont affect the meta at all.
---
The only winning move in listening to players is not to play.
---
Keeping value in wallets implies a decently functioning logistics chain or market setup to replace losses. Something that is available to highly organised / larger groups rather than small.
---
High / Low / NPC Null stations are an option but would likely require some space geography changes to bring things in to balance again.
---
Not all of the resist profiles are built in, however, unless I have a *really* outdated pyfa.
---
To close out my previous point: i asked a friend who actually looks at EVE code from time to time and skins work how i expected (ship x now being able to have the reference to its visual ressource changed instead of getting an exact copy with a different ressource)  
---
So yes i do agree its not worthwhile to add citadel skins on a larger scale with this system but not because of difficulty, just simply because of effort and i agree with you that the lack of functionality also plays a part. (For 2 or 3 Keepstars it might be ok tho :P)
---
What i could imagine is adding a skin inventory like characters have for corps but i neither have the knowlege of python nor of how EVE is built to make an ellegant assessment of how difficult this would be to add and thus will refrain from suggesting that they should do this.
---
Today we are happy to be sharing the proposed details of twelve new sets of advanced pirate implants planned for release this summer. These new implant sets include the highly anticipated “shield slaves”. **They will also come alongside** some related module balance changes and **module tiericide**.

---
1 Corp? More like 1 dude mining
---
True
---
Its almost like they could do this with local too with FLEX Intel structure or have E-War that affect ingame chat channels or broadcast by FC or for reps.
---
No please dear god no more structures or jesus modules.
---
You're talking like the two are mutually exclusive. But eve is an interconnected organism. The removal/delay of zkill and dotlan may well have an effect on the proliferation /use of caps in a meaningful way.
---
hilmar? listen to player input?
---
lmao ok
---
&gt; The information on Dotlan is almost exclusively only useful offensively, if you nerf that you're only hurting people trying to make things happen (and thus buffing the very kind of null sec groups blackout was supposed to hurt).
---
This is the important point. Delaying parts of zkill is fine if people are for it, but removing all Dotlan info is just going to make fewer things explode in the game.
---
I'm pretty easy to please, anything that sparks fights/conflict/etc. is a positive in my book. Blackout has been interesting in this way, it seems to have brought more groups out in space and made 0.0 a bit more dynamic, in a sense, even if it has lowered overall ratting activity as a whole. This is overall a good thing, from what most people feel (CCP included).
---
They need to be careful just going "REMOVE EVERYTHING" because that will ultimately lead to fewer fights, which would really be a shame.
---
Station Traders create no ISK, they only redistribute it. They aren't causing the ISK inflation.
---
Speculators do cause prices to change but that's a different matter. In the long term they can only accentuate trends that were already forming.
---
There are so many reasons this is an asinine suggestion, but let's keep it simple and point out that Eve without AARs/BRs loses a fuckton of its conversation.
---
That EvE has own subreddit, that has been bothering me a while.
---
it's almost like the people who were begging for local blackout and removal of free intel were not content creators, just stupid pubbie roambois
---
New hunter could still have a harder time.
---
Aimlessly roaming empty space for hours isn't encouraging.
---
1 Dude? More like 1 bot mining
---
As a whole, I think citadel mechanics should work similar to how POS mechanics work, making it easier and faster to clean out the inactive ones.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c8mie1/doing_drifters_work/ does a great job of discussing that.
---
If that change happened, you could have the [ABANDONED] structures also not function for tethering. That'd be a good step in the right direction.
---
I hate that the Proteus is utter garbage
---
How does one even come to that conclusion?
---
That theres no sale on markeedragon. 15% discount is cool and all but it would be even better on $ instead of €
---
oh man the game you're describing sounds terrible, is it eve online?
---
If they're going to add some kind of defensive mechanism to obscure kill or jump reporting in a system, it should be really expensive.  Like, you can block kill reporting, but it also blocks insurance payout.
---
use trusted tradehubs then
---
People who like to triple rep. it's not that uncommon on a rep bonused ship when fitting allows for it
---
Why? Rorquals are super easy to afk multibox
---
I mean it really is a garbage place, tbh
---
Not enough supers or rorquals, fake delve dscan
---
Everyone is that kind of person. That's exactly what markets are for.
---
also delay the API structure information 1h before the structure timer, you can't sneak behind the line RF everything just because everyone get the information 10m after you hit the shield timer w\_w

I hate that all this blackout stuff is making me want to resub but i've been winning for years now and it seems a shame to spoil that.
---
&gt; You realise how young he was right?
---
that doesn't mean having a sour opinion of him based on real actual interactions isn't justified. people who start playing a game like eve online at a young age and put a bad taste in people's mouths because they're not very mature are rightly shunned until they show that they can behave like an adult
---
&gt;Half the FCs out there are more cancerous now than he ever was
---
what fcs are you interacting with because no, the majority of fcs in eve are not toxic. being toxic generally makes people not join your fleets
---
super duper mad

But then there's the whole "Oh shit, you're winning... here's my entire personal Cap fleet" shtick.
---
Albion doesn't even have a lot of any player base.
---
LUL
---
Yes, the game developers have no way to track multiple different things simultaneously - which is obvious since they didn't talk about their findings, how they tracked it, and what they were looking for, while discussing the blackout and skilling spree at the same time.

hello eutz pl member who was present for most of PF's fleets against pl checking in
---
it didn't matter who was fcing, literally every time fcon or your coalition brought out a fleet to shoot pl you fed like professional caterers
---
PF as a coalition was doomed to failure from the very beginning - fcon was one of the more respectable provi/northern alliances but y'all were never strong enough to stand on your own (not enough dedicated/competent pvp players, no strong campaign commander fcs, fc bullpen not deep enough), let alone lead your own coalition
---
blaming it on people like nour samy i don't get because the guy who was the mediocre fc leading your strat op fleets wasn't the problem, it was the paper pushers who decided "yeah, fcon could lead an independent coalition"
---
Inb4 200 new daily threads suggesting adding an anchorable citadel for just this.
---
&gt;The removal/delay of zkill and dotlan may well have an effect on the proliferation /use of caps in a meaningful way.
---
How do you envision this?
---
I mean, as it is now this is such a hollow statement. It may have an effect. Or it may not. I personally wouldn't want to change any game based on vague blanket statements about what may or may not happen.
---
grr the player dont hat the game

Because Grrr Goons?

&gt;Remember pre citadels/pre fozzie sov when you could create a timer and get a fight over a moon or some shit? shocking concept I know.

Every step away from that concept was a step towards the trash bin.

Way to ignore the nuances of what's wrong with the game. But hey, you got a snarky comment out of it!
---
Yes, because burst jammers don't affect friendly Dreks...
---
It gives a pop-up if there's a new version and there have been 2 updates in that last few days. So if you did turn off that pop-up I suggest you update or enable that pop-up again :)
---
Wildkins input here is completely valid. What he's saying is generally the sentiment that was held by most members of my alliance, including FCs and leadership, back in PFED days. Nour wasn't a terrible FC or a terrible person but he could turn into a massive douche when he got upset and it was very common for him to rage when it was entirely unnecessary.
---
Could be worse, though. He could be xxjanxx.

This subreddit has always been subject to a clueless but loud majority shouting dumb shit, and people who actually understand the ramifications of any given change being downvoted and ignored. Meanwhile EVE is spiraling further down the drain. But hey, at least we can make snarky comments about it online!
---
No this situation was never possible in K space.     
---
So better let not make it a reality
---
That when the Blackout hit my play time became almost non-existent due to RL. So maybe that’s not fair...
---
Um, streaming scouts on all the major gates and routes around the areas I like to hunt ) Fuck, again, not really eve’s fault. 
---
Ok!!! I have a real one: 
---
The fact I need to dock to redeem my boosters, instead of being allowed to put them straight to my cargo.
---
Haha there’s nothing wrong with citadels, you’re crazy 😭
---
Ok
---
Oligarchy never was good for anything but the oligarchs ...
---
Serenity had a huge gaping security hole that was the translation code iirc.  Lack of ESI wasn't the problem
---
Nope - Then again, I don't think tethering should be a thing at all. 
---
Only mooring for titans and supercarriers.
---
No I don’t, it seems goddamn obvious that they shouldn’t...but I guess they do say “low power” and not “no power”. But mechanics-wise, it’s dumb as fuck.

That’s a cool idea my dude!!

We don’t broadcast pilot names even in civilian airplanes... that information is redundant.
---
Right now if you roam in a cloaky group with for exanple stratios and you kill one enemy all following enemys will know its bait.
---
Removing it is wrong. Delaying it or even delaying some information is absolutly neccesary.
---
For example the death of a ship could be live.  But showing who killed it should 100% be delayed.
---
Would be nice if some info collecting  was tied to a information collecting beacon ingame. Constellation wide structure with no ref timer thats needed to get xxx info.
---
There's intel and there's intel.
---
Removal of kill mails would have significant negative effects. Delaying them, that'd be fine.
---
(Say what you will, but all players of games like the ding when they achieve something. Everyone wants to keep score. and killmails are the method of choice for some people. Removing that dopamine hit isn't good)
---
That would make lore sense as well. I like it.
---
*chuckle*
---
They miss Gemi.
---
And still is in post places... Only that now with obesity.
---
Well, in my opinion, you trade on an unsafe structure without influence on the owner? Take the consequences for your greed to save some taxes and fees ... simple as that. Else trade on stations, the badly inflated ISK-Amount of EVE needs every ISK-Sink it can get ...
---
It shouldnt be neccesary to annchor something to block it.
---
It should be the other way around.
---
And whatever that struc is it should die after a few hours automatically.
---
like Jita IV-4, because who would trust some nullsec oligarchs ...
---
Oh cool, another increase in the price of everything
---
I so agree with this! CCP Make this happen!
---
Who holds eve players in some higher regard? I like playing spreadsheets with spaceships as much as the next person but it's not some amazing achievement that anyone outside the players themselves care about.

:thinkign:
---
Then you put all the Star Citizens together with EVE’s ‘general population’ and you tell them “those shiny ships you bought. About that: once you undock and somebody decides to take a shot at you and you lose the boat... you’re not getting it back.”
---
I would do it for that reason alone.
---
Did you just write that? How about posting your own thread...
---
Looks like they are, last year was also pretty solid up until the brisc drama
---
I have joined today.
---
Fair thing, since you already patched the 30-sec-notether after cyno jump in, leaving (or better reopening) the niche for Lowsec-Cap/Supercap-Hunters that Citadel patch closed with insta-tether on jump in, what basically was the equivalent to cynoing into a forcefield directly (what has been considered an exploit back then).
---
That’s a mining frigate that fucked a Naga. Also ‘Veld’ or? Really? What’s next, they put Chribba’s face on the flank of the boat?
---
You're trying to apply logic to Hilmar.
---
Fool's Errand.
---
Lol, they live in a bubble. That interview was cringy and left me feeling "what is happening?". Its like the company is suffering from delusion, like Im really worried about their wellbeing as individuals.
---
Or it has to do with the changes always being either meaningless number adjustments that sit for years or it's a huge change that also sits for years. 
---
No middle ground.
---
Nah.  Removal of intel sources is terrible for roamers - especially solo ones - as not only can you not check for gatecamps to avoid (or break if you have the right gang), but you can't even check recent activity to find where you might actually be able to get a fight.
---
In the long term, the local blackout is also a negative thing for roaming unless it comes with other significant balance changes.  The likely progression as things stand now is that you have more groups huddling together under their umbrellas, megacamping choice pockets, and nothing but lots and lots of dead space in between.
---
This attitude is what's killing EVE, the whole attitude that nullsec should be a safe haven where you keep everything you've ever owned.
---
None of these would *really* be an issue if
---
I think a citadel that activates any standup module should get a  2h/6h/18h (astra/fort/keep) "weapons timer" during which there are no reinforcement timers at all. Meaning you could bash shield &amp; armor &amp; hull in one go. 
---
Give ~~stations~~citadel games a chance? :D
---
Also remove asset safety in high/low/null
---
bUt ThEy NEeD to SuPpOrT 800x600
---
&gt;someone from csm actually said this
---
Thats true. Never thought of it that way. The gap is too wide which explains why the changes are so odd. Interesting.
---
Yes, the player count is way too low comparing the immensity of space, we need a way of knowing where we can find content
---
Carriers are good against everything, except mining. 
---
Rorquals are good for mining. 
---
That's pretty much everything you need to know.
---
Nah that is the guy salvaging behind the supers
---
Well as I read it it's not anything where it's going to have a blanket effect. Its only blocking ESI locally so people cant glean information so aimlessly as they can now. I imagine this could actually help the small guys by allowing them to operate in a small constellation under cover of false information. Yeah the big guys could deploy large swaths of them in an entire region but why though? To hide where their miners are? Where the ratters are? Counter that by making it a temporary 24hr deployable with a base value of 500mil. Even the big alliances would have a huge isk sink paying 30bil a month for just 1.
---
&gt;that information is redundant.
---
Except it explicitly isn't redundant in Eve, so, what?
---
CCP
---
Ye the pendelum swing has already swung back on them and what would you know, hypocrisy is starting to show.
---
BR here: https://br.inyour.space/?s=4650&amp;b=8705940&amp;e=90&amp;t=Kai (obviously missing a lot of bastion/init ships, as both we and waffles got out pretty clean)
---
We were tempted to try and keep poking the grid after titans landed, especially as you can see several bumping off hard, but didn't think we'd be able to break any with what we had (knowing there would be plenty of fax to come) , with no further reinforcements available.
---
If you look closely at about 9:28, you can see the moment where I started channelling chessur to duck the lances.
---
Dont you fucking tell me that suddenly Hilmar started to care about EVE. What the *acshuelle* fuck?!
---
Yup, definitely get those two crucial skills then! Also look into margin trading if you happen to do buy orders, though it's not super useful otherwise.
---
Lmao the fuck is this comment? 
---
Like seriously I'm trying to unpack this here - who are you calling Content Creators? Because before Blackout, "content" was basically just roaming in kitey shit and killing krab defence. Nobody is going out shooting citadels putting pressure on structures because it's overly hard, so Content Creators aren't doing that. What are Content Creators doing that doesn't involve being "pubbie roambois"?
---
I feel you, man. After getting my Chremoas, I've not had a goal I've been passionate about. You can always create goals for the sake of having them, but it's not the same as truly caring about something to the point you're willing to sacrifice blood, sweat and tears for it.
---
i never said pubbie roambois actually knew what they wanted, just that they complain loudly on reddit and hold strong opinions
---
removing instant free intel sounds like a good change unless you're a content creator who uses those things to create content like everyone else does in tyool 2019 and you know that removing them will make it even harder to find shit to do in eve than it already is
---
Use the in-game fitting tool to simulate an astra with a market module in it and it shows thw daily fuel use in the data on the right.
---
Unless you are in a faction war hotspot like Amamake you probably won't get much biz. Set up near one though with a bunch of T1 frigs, ammo, and fittings for sale and you might make some isk.
---
Exactly.
---
There is stuff I can do, stuff I should do, stuff I need to do... but what is missing are things I want to do.
---
Fake news, we all know they don't talk to players, let alone listen.
---
Was a 2 man alliance created when we needed a brand to enlarge the discord. Now we have more than enough ppl. We also kind of always regretted the name as we both operate outside delve too. And mar5hy began recruiting so he didn't wanna look like doing just delve.
---
Our Delve ops continue although I'm busy af irl.
---
Blackout did kill my excavator booshing. I think it's good for the game.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cdm73l/blackout_now_forever/etv0aph/

&gt; That's an in character news piece, no one has released any information saying this would be forever.
---

---
This is the same in character news piece, it has nothing to do with indefinite vs. permanent.
---
&gt;TEST received intel from Goons 
---
Snitches man...
---
I would prefer it if citadel timers used stront like a POS.
---
Preferably so if there is no fuel when your structure is reinforced the stront timer doesnt start and it can go down in one hit.
---
If certain structures need multiple timers - give them multiple stront bays and each timer runs off its own bay.
---
Not everything was bad about the POS mechanics and it feels like they threw the good out with the bad when making citadels.
---
While I understand the goal of this idea, I disagree with it. It will benefit the bigger groups while choking the smaller groups. I would put like a timer on tether, a ship can't just sit there tethered for ever, like after a few minutes or something the tether would let go. 
---
It would keep the goad of tethering while making it more balanced.
---
What he posted looks like the sarcastic reply of someone knowing actually what he speaks of to a dumb and unreasoned post. Sadly the answer he got was like the post he raected to ...
---
Wardec still up so: " to be continued..." ;&gt;
---
citadel and sov mechanics
---
ya cant fit an market to medium structures only XL and L
---
You can put structures everywhere. Most gates in NS have a citadel perch which lets people tether and deny any kind of fight.
---
Pink doughnut when?
---
Damn boi HK thicc
---
Well at least this time your trying for someone over the age of consent. Last time that didnt work out so well for you. I mean really? a 4 year old, your one sick bastard.
---
ya cant fit an market to medium structures only XL and L: azbel being the cheapest
---
I was thinking about Jakanerva since its seems in a nice crossroads position.
---
How do I identify the faction war systems? The symbol description on dotlan seems somewhat incomplete ^^"
---
Astras can't fit Market services.
---
Was a fun fight, nice to see some old school waffles on grid too. Thanks for the assist.
---
For many of us that adopted it during the opt in phase, there was a chance we crashed at the worst times, I crashed running a ghost site due to 64bit shenanigans
---
Would you rather the ships be destroyed entirely? Because thats the alternative.
---
Is setting up an azbel as a trading station a good idea? To my understanding it would be pretty vulnerable.
---
lol .. meta level 100
---
So where your profitability spreadsheet currently tells you 75% of items are unprofitable to make, after this change it'll be closer to 95%.
---
So just wondering,  where did that 200bil of goo go? 
---
a) to market
---
b)in a holding pattern to be sold....at market later (thanks for selling that cheap later). Cause each day the folks holding it are going to be seeing their pile grow and price grow.
---
c) in Mittens ass?
---
This goo blockade is at best a temporary thing, lots of steam and smoke, but like I said, blackout had a bigger impact.
---
Without zKill, i will make no fun to shoot Ships....
---
and without DotLan and Intel about the Region... NS will be a big empty place to hunt ...
---
Most People will go to LS for PVP. 
---
A Solution would be a Local Blackout.
---
System Without Local Chat, will not transmit ESI Information. Like in the WH Systems. 
---
So if, NS Allys want back there local, with an Special Module for Citas, they will have Local Chats but also ESI Information. It will make a ballance. They will have the safty from the Local and the hunters will get Information where is Activity... Sounds like an idea ?
---
Well, a lot of people are not positive about the amount of intel their are delivering. So from development perspective what would be a easy way to handle this? For example the information zkill gives you about an opponent. If you wanna prevent people from checking out opponents before engaging, you would try to prevent the permanent display of all kill/lossmails a person collects. Thats not really possible with the ESI since zkill just collects all killmails in a database. IF CCP would implement their own solution for example within the game client they could control the information flow given to the community and limit it. Example: If you're navigating to a players killboard, just display the killmails of the last days or even hours. Same goes for dotlan, just shut it down and let the community play with the current ingame map for getting intel.
---
Information shouldn't be both instant and perfect. I think it's fine to either delay or obfuscate elements of both, but not necessary to completely remove both.
---
It's water. Someone's been boiling those beans
---
"do not shoot goons"
---
good boy seddow
---
well ccp fixed local :) see answer down below for more insight. It's not about if ccp is capable of doing things. The community AND ccp want to change up things by inserting chaos, I'm just showing possibilities.
---
He was probably referring to corporate risk - if there were issues with the client, his bosses at Pearl Abyss would fire him and he wouldn't be able to cash in his options.
---
I'm sorry but what the fuck is pubbie supposed to mean in EVE?
---
A marketplace for intel (and bait) could be a nice idea in post-instant-intel EVE
---
Go to test brave goon ph gotg should be good to find content; it s that i do ;)
---
The main issue with this is that I cannot cloak up and go for a bog break. I'll end up wetting myself.
---
&gt; Without a way to find activity it could get frustrating to hunt
---
Cant speak for anyone else, but mine share has been refined and is now being used in reactions, the resulting products will then be sold in Delve, and I guess used to produce T2 stuff, which will then also be sold in Delve.
---
Have fun as a casual player with 2hrs a day or so looking for content in a few thousand systems
---
There is a filter on the map.
---
How about we do these changes and remove asset safety completely. So, you could trade in better margins but with some risk..
---
The problem is the "fights" it encourages are ganks (not battles.)   PVPbears have it too easy at the moment.   Delaying ESI is a great idea.
---
Delayed kills change nothing in that regard

*Some* of those posters were far far more blatant.
---
The caricature of “the West” isn’t invoking those tropes by accident, OP. Soviet Propagandists didn’t spend time building up that animosity to then not to use it.
---
It’s one thing to have not noticed it, it’s another to deny  it’s being (at the very least) implied. I would argue that in the original historical context, the inference would have been blatantly obvious to the original audience.
---

Well our goo didnt go up Mittens ass, but your opinions have certainly come out of yours

He said without being frustrated. If i wanna go 40 jumps from jita to get killed in 2s ... not sure if that solves my problem in terms of fun ... it rather solves my problem deciding if i wanna play something else instead for some time :D
---
&gt;They sure are and they should move to highsec and lowsec where they belong.
---
This is the main thing. HS/LS/NS were created as areas where players can self-select for how much risk they want to take in the game.
---
 If "but my stuff might get blown up!" is a serious, game-breaking concern for someone, and they feel that living in null is appropriate and comfortable, that's the first sign something is wrong with game mechanics.
---
Hey at least you're not getting bosoned in R1O
---
What's the fuel consumption for a small pos?
---
Surely there needs to be some benefit to upwells considering their much higher purchase cost
---
Just a thought but, if you remove everything, would'nt this be an actual change for little alliances/corps in null? I mean everybody goes to the big blocs with their gang and searching for picks (which is fine). But if smaller entities try to build and mine in their little space and nothing knows about it because its typcially dead there, would'nt that be something good?
---
Shower thoughts
---
I have nothing against scamming, damn i even would laugh hard when goons instead of burning only NCPL stuff could bring tons of war spoils.       
---
But still it don't change the fact that while it could be fun in short term ... in longer it would only make it worst as the only people with structures are big players capable of fielding multiple 255 man fleets.
---
Cynos have been a bad idea ever since they were introduced way back in 2005/6 (?) and probably had more to do with the strategic benefits they would give CCP employees alliances/groups than they would the average player. After all, those were the days where CCP devs were manipulating gameplay via bannings and the T2 blueprint seeding scandal (causing shifts in balance that still exist today).
---
it is only worth if you can defend it...if you don't have numbers and connections it will be teared down pretty soon. Owning market citadels in High Sec is a monopol.
---
Lack of vision from CCP.
---
You just described CCP lore for the past 5 years
---
Highsec wardeccing?
---
Make citadels work like stations, but with huge undock.
---
Could be a nice idea if it was a "built-in" basic SM, like the FLEX structures have. For small cits, there aren't enough service slots as it is.
---
Shooting Concord isn't bannable, they are just invincible and doing so results in your ship dying
---
You been to the TTT in the last week?
---
So what you're saying is that if you roam Horde space in Jags, you're invisible?
---
You wasted an opportunity there - you should sell the alliance :D      
---
I bet someone in Delve would pay like 20bil for it.
---
Yeah and remember when /r/eve tried to laugh me off the CSM because "this ain't a garage door cyno it's a cyno INTO the garage?"
---
Oh i agree about isk sinks.       
---
But we need smart isk sinks.             
---
Also whats the point of creating new isk sinks but not applying it in the same way across all structures.
---
The move to dronelands + the increase of pvp'ers in blackout, lots of beans lusting for blood
---
&gt; skill based intelligence tools
---
It already exists. It's called dscan. If hunters can't be seen in local why should hunters see ratters in the map anywhere in the universe? It's hilarious seeing those want local removed now spinning their head in this thread. They don't want a better eve. They only want their own activity to made easier. 
---
Delay kb for 24h so people can still brag on zkill.

I have no idea what you are talking about, but I found another translator that sucks
---
Sadly, gone are the days of O-VWPB. I miss the crazy fights we had there, those were the days. 
---
For us at least, can't really take any gang to R1O any more. If you want to fight Horde now, you have to be a jump or 2 out, either by regular gate or Jump Gate.
---
Still, props to Horde for still responding with subcaps to most things. They're good people, for the most part, even if they fly Jaguars (which are absurdly broken).
---
Up until recently, I was always bothered by how solved EVE was - which makes sense, because it's a 16 year old game. Hopefully this Age of Chaos can throw some wrenches into the gearbox.
---
As a second order effect, I was also bothered by how entitled players can be from both PvE (I deserve complete safety due to mechanics) and PvP (I deserve kills due to mechanics) perspective.
---
A loki also only has 3 mids, which is not enough control for a blap comp.
---
CEOs and their subdirs afraid to use dreads for content because omg killboards so we arent allowed to attack citadels in enemy space because superumberla even tho 0 enemies online. "But spies see our pings" okay then we could easily just form corp fleet without ping but too scared of potential of losing dreads although we have hundreds in dread cache.
---
&gt;The likely progression as things stand now is that you have more groups huddling together under their umbrellas, megacamping choice pockets, and nothing but lots and lots of dead space in between.
---
That hasn't been much of a problem for me as a solo roamer though, because I know just where to go to find content. Sure, you have to stay one step ahead of the standing fleet but that isn't too hard most of the time.
---
Local needs to stay gone, zkill and dotlan need to carry on more or less as usual, or maybe with a slight delay but nothing too drastic.
---
I haven't entirely understood your question, but it seems like you are wondering why stations and other objects in eve are all on one plane. Normally a star system with planets actually mostly sticks to a horizontal plane, due to the formation of star systems being through large disks of material which orbit the star in it's earliest stages, and eventually impacts between materials in this horizontal disk form planets. As for landing on a station perfectly horizontal to it, it could be explained as the station being built to accommodate visitors from the various gates along the edges of a system and therefore are horizontally situated
---
I mental reasoning for this is because New Eden, despite in space not having a “down”, did establish a conventional “down” for uniformity purposes. The same way humans established a “north”.
---
With the probability of being down voted to below the Devil, Isn't interacting with the Eve community, literally what he gets paid to do?
---
They are that way because it's easier to code.
---
Fog of war! Fog of war! Fog of war! Fog of waaaaaaaaaaaaaar!!
---
in all honesty... this actualy fixes some issues too... now you cant have player setup trade hubs and avoid taxes that reduce isk sinks

---
Shield slaves are coming this summer I think
---
Reverse doctor who?
---
Had some fights with Serenity Coalition over our trade Azbels in Perimeter, but not outside that. Is there content to be had outside station and gatecamping the Amarr - Jita pipe?
---
space is sooo damn big and empty, with the blackout it's even more empty and we should search 80% of empty space in hope we get something ?   
---
meh, not gonna do that, even with "free intel" it's boring
---
It’s a shame it’s become a haven for ping warriors. Jump gates makes it worse as within a minute the gang your fighting becomes the horde.
---
Asset safety has only been in the game for a couple years. Player citadels have only been around a couple years. Null has only been this safe and filled with supers for a few years. Rorquals have only been trashing the value of minerals for a few years. Many of the changes people are advocating for in null are to bring the game back in line to what it was before.
---
You would learn how to fit ships by yourself and get better at the game the same time then
---
That sound Dscan makes.
---
Ganking ratters in null is usually a secondary thing unless you specifically go out of your way to do that. Most roamers want to fight the response fleet, not just gank a Myrm and fuck off. It's become so cheap and easy to replace ships though that I've had pilots legit eject from their current ratting boat, go to the citadel, grab another one, and continue on their way, all while I'm still holding tackle on the current Myrm.
---
Well tbh, there are always hotspots in the large blocs to look. Without the tools it would be harder sure, but it would also be more of an achievement and would take the hunters to gain experience where to hunt and where not. It would also bring back some mystery aspect to space tbh.
---
&gt;fcon
---
Tldr
---
Allow the fog of war so the krabs can pretend they can hide.
---
this is a little extreme, even for my standards
---
removing asset safety would bring back a reason to go piss in other people's backyards... we did fine with pos mechanics.... why would we all the sudden be unable to play without asset safety..did we get weak ?
---
When 80% of established nullsec blocs are blued up maintaining the status quo of the perimeter keepstar it's easier said than done. It's clear that the perimeter trade hub is already too valuable, making it worth even more will only further decrease conflict because nobody is going to be risking that income - especially when they are vocal about not wanting to defend it.
---
oh no I definitely do mr. internet tough guy
---
That's why roamers use ships other than bombers/nullified ceptors/cloaky T3's.
---
Nice video, whats the overlay that you are using for comms in the top left corner?
---
I dono, I've never tried it, but I've had this romantic idea of finding a small industrial corporation living out in the ass end of highsec, wardeccing them, and holding their shit hostage. Either get cash money as a ransom and drop the wardec, or get blueballed and kill a structure, or fight whatever mercs they decide to hire.
---
I can see asset safety for the situation described above.
---
I can't see asset safety for "OMG Goons are glassing a region.  No need to defend, I'll just asset safety my shit to somewhere safe."
---
i like you more with long black hair....just saying
---
It's gonna go like this:
---
They gonna delay Killmails because too much information
---
&gt; every one gonna cheer
---
next they gonna remove killsmail endpoint, because too much information
---
&gt; everyone gonna cheer
---
then they gonna remove other esi endpoints, because too much information
---
&gt; some people gonna notice something is going wrong
---
they shut down ESI and fire the devs
---
&gt; too late to regret
---
In the same way removing local was detrimental to other playstyles?:)
---
I dont like the blackout, and I dont like removing dotlan. Both will hurt the game long term. Zkill can be used by both sides so a delay would work.
---
Even a few hours would be fine. I really hope they don’t remove zkill because after all the memes about being 1337 and how only losers care about zkill, I and a lot of other people do care about it and it’s a motivator for people to play the game and be good at it.
---
(Also can’t laugh at NC. killboard without it, e.g https://zkillboard.com/kill/77973581/ )
---
Well yeah, I kinda just said that. Roamers want response fleet kills, gankers want to gank and get out. Two different types of PvP, but yet people mash them together.
---
Also nullified ceptors are usually the initial tackle for roaming gangs, not as primary DPS to kill a ratting Myrm.
---

on the matter of sound: I like aura waaaay more with the old voice. That was really adding to the space environment. The new aura voice is more like a help to what is actually happening in the game and much more direct.
---
adapt or die
---
I roam with small gangs looking for small gangs, and I do riskier nulpve in appropriately fit and replaceable ships should I get blown up. But most importantly, I get off of zero and don't go afk so when a desy or gang lands I can warp out, then I reship and try to get a fight. Content for everyone, no need for supers, out in npc null. 
---
Not everything revolves around you in the first place. It would be great if more of space didn't have instant titan buttons precisely because hit and runs with no chance of escalation suck ass, but that's what the majority of care ears have forced into the meta in their space. Basically any other op strategy is retarded when almost no krabs respond the way you claim to and we no longer have proactive defense (meaning less gang skirmishes and gate fights). Everything is reactive cyno warfare, and that's the issue. We don't want to spend all day popping you, we want your fucking alliances to actively go out there for subcap fights other than on honor brawls. You're the only targets left sadly, that's the endgame of your fortress mentality pIaystyle. If you can't bring a fleet of titans the best you can do in nulempire space is hit and run krab ganks. I really don't give a shit about delve or any other similar regions anyway though, the fun has been optimized out of them by your alliances. 
---
Blackout has been loads of fun for the unregulated areas of space, and you're still safer where you are than 99% of space. The fact that you're sperging out so hard and there are others mining and shit IN NULL without backup right now is hilarious, you're so fucking entitled. You can still light a cyno and panic your fucking rorq. I don't fly rorqs, I don't give a fuck. 
---
You know, I like, interact with the game I'm playing and the other people I'm playing it with. I'm on both sides of the coin, and none of my experiences match up with yours. Funny thing about anecdotes. Anyway, don't be surprised if you hang out in some giant bitch ass alliance that mainly bitchy players fly around there.
---
 The instant ultra escalation many krab alliances do makes it stupid to hang around waiting for the counter in places like delve considering what's coming 90% of the time is in fact NOT a reasonable fight, despite your apparent best intentions to generate content. If only more bloccers had your attitude 🙄
---
There is a big difference between tactically significant intelligence and intelligence that creates content.
---
For example, on the map you can see how many NPCs were killed in the last hour which them may draw roaming pvp gangs.  You WANT this to happen. Roaming pvp gangs create content, provide a challenge, give the pvp shakes to many participating, and generate wrecks that fuel the economy.
---
What information you don't want make available is tactically significant data that is updated in real time.  An example of this is: how large is that roaming pvp gang? (How many guys were on the last killmail).  That is the data you want to restrict.  I can make a tactical decision on that data. I can look at the size of my response fleet and decide to hide under my rock and starve content or go out and crush them with vastly superior force.
---
As soon as that's a thing, my corp goes all in on intel collection.
---
More money with the expense of less fun, less sandbox, less player driven economy, less EVE.
---
Wondering how much it will last.

Your posts haven’t been deleted, nor have you been banned, nor warned, nor downvoted, nor reported (to my knowledge). You have in no way been “shut down”.

You were informed that the historical image you used had a *context*, and instead of acknowledging the possibility, you denied it outright. Then, when your denial was questioned, you implied a degree of censorship that doesn’t exist.

Thanks! That’s the overwolf overlay for TS2.

Any difference for myr?
---
I have T2 drones and everything to IV , drone related.
---
So i guess i cant have both worlds..i either go with a ship for pvp or pve..damn..
---
True fact - Nullsec get spooked in hisec 
---
This happens to l33t players from small corps since there is just so much grey and red EVERYWHERE!  (also gate guns, and their negative sec status matters.)
---
And it happens to nullbloc players because suddenly not EVERYTHING is blue and there is no umbrella.
---
Overwolf i think
---
While there is great variation in ways to fit a ship, this also extends to hulls that can be used for activities. If you have anything in mind you'd like to do, the more specific you are with what you want to do, the easier it will be for you to find that information yourself.  
---
That being said, have a look through here, it might help. [https://www.eveworkbench.com/](https://www.eveworkbench.com/)
---
Name it "horde" or "NBI Jaguar" and you're good to go. 😉
---
A+ Great video. Music selection needs a lot of work though
---
All of Panfam is in a condensed area and it takes 2 jumps for Horde to be in NC/PH staging due to bridges and compactness of the drone lands. Just think of it as a larger Delve but just as compact/mazelike.
---
Think they mean more along the lines of skills that would say delay your data from showing in the data pulls. Say skills that make your kills delayed 30 mins even if someone you killed has their account liked to zkill. Manual posting should still work without delay for example but the auto pulls would be delayed. That kind of thing.
---
We were tempted to try and keep poking the grid after titans landed, especially as you can see several bumping off hard, but didn't think we'd be able to break any with what we had (knowing there would be plenty of fax to come), and we had no further reinforcements available.
---
If you look closely at about 9:28, you can see the moment where I started channelling chessur to duck the lances :D
---
Don't. 
---
It's too painful.
---
I just pretend it never existed.

All solar systems have a plane. So all you need to do is pick clockwise or anti-clockwise for the rotation of the star. Once you have that then 'up' is relative to the plane when the star is viewed rotating in the chosen direction.

Is it just me or did he just suggest something smart and balancing? This must be the Twilight zone
---
Says ur in amarr... Figures it doesnt count. Amarr are a buch of drug dealers and slavers. You think they see those janitors as people or goods?
---
A lack of decent merchandise :(
---
Yeah about time nullbears got fucked.
---
Or he calls three more garmurs...
---
Well, I don't think your line of thought should be supported. Just because it used to be like that, it is not a good mechanic just for that fact.
---
However, I agree, that low power citadels should lose most of it's functions, because you should have to pay for the advantages.
---
I would also propose a single 24h reinforcement timer on structures, determined again by the initial reinforcement, if in low power
---
Which is why everybody joined his fleets and not certain others. So perhaps he might not be so honest after all.
---
Wouldn't that sort of reaction be expected from a group with "horde" in their name?
---
Yea I guess... but the kiters you need to catch at 0km, the brawlers at 20kms, but for example against a dual prop dramiel you cant do much I guess...
---
Got a laugh out of me. I give it up!
---
Scans indicate that the delivery includes D. It was a literal Dscan
---
Haha the irony of this troll post is mind numbing
---
If you call that a maintenance fee it would still do the exact same thing in terms of game mechanics so don’t be pedantic and miss the forest for the trees
---
I don't disagree with the need to maybe shake things up a bit.
---
I do disagree with throwing a handful of shit against the wall just to see what will stick.
---
In any ordered system, change is inevitably dangerous, and should be approached methodically and cautiously.  
---
The big problem I see with most of the changes being made are that they will disproportionately impact newer players and smaller alliances.  Established players and alliances can adapt and absorb more easily.
---
Yeah, I'm a new(ish) player, but I'm established enough that the only thing the changes (to date) are impacting is how quickly I make money.  Sure, it's slowed it down a bit - but I'm still making money.  But the impact to CCP is that I have allowed several alt accounts to expire (not a "fuck this" - but I see no need to continue to sub them until we see where everything ends up landing).
---
However, I think back on how I got started:
---
VNI ratting (just one account, not botting).  Impacted by nerfs, made way more risky by local blackout.
---
Salvaging (which will be impacted by tax hikes and blackout).
---
Now that I am mining and ratting with caps?  Meh - I've seen a total of now 3 people land on grid with my miners, and none with my ratter.  This is since the blackout began.  It's actually much less than I saw before the blackout.
---
So is it really working?  Is it providing more content?  More danger?  Is it severely impacting me?  Nope.  But what about the little guy?  Is that really what is best for the game?
---
Everyone is whining about null being too safe.  Ruining the game.  Isn't that the whole point of sov?  Why bother going through the effort and expense of establishing sov if you can't exploit the resources of the area, and protect those doing it?  Isn't that essentially what Concord is doing in HS, only it's being run by players instead of AI?
---
Kitey bullshit is invincible and kills carrier drones tho.
---
And rorqual drones.
---
TLDR: we just want to drop our titans and dread bombs on small corps and not have to worry about being baited into an escalation we cant run away from
---
&gt; But if smaller entities try to build and mine in their little space and nothing knows about it because its typcially dead there, would'nt that be something good?
---
Nah. Everything gets spotted eventually and once it's known you can't put it back in the box. It works fine for individuals and maybe very small groups trying to ninja stuff on the sly, but it doesn't work if you're trying to put down roots.
---
I think a lot of this discussion is moot because we're talking about hypotheticals. What we assume will happen.
---
Lets just test these assumptions and hypotheses. 
---
If CCP are looking to be more agile and experimental, it certainly seems worthy of at least a small experiment on the live server. Play around with it, try a black out, try a delay etc.
---
And now she cant see it cum-ing

---
I've had the same romantic idea, actually. There's a couple of issues with it, though. I'd wardec with V0LTA, my main's corp, so if they put up enough of a defense to stop me, it'd be at the scale where V0LTA would find it interesting. Secondly, there's no risk for me. I don't need the ransom. I don't need the space. I'm not removing competition. If I somehow didn't curbstomp and ended up losing, I have nothing invested in the fight and wouldn't care.

EVE: The MMO submarine simulator
---
Super newbie here, like 3h of time played. I've done the tutorial, started doing careers agents, but I've failed 2 of them because of Triglavian Invasion, I can't move out of the system 'cause I'm being insta blown to bits, whats should I do? It's not really fun to be stuck in one place, maybe I'm missing something? Or I need to wait till event ends?
---
"might"...?
---
Yeah they talked about this on the TIS special. They said a few times that they'd like intelligence to be a player job in the game, not just data you scrape.
---
imo that game knowledge gap was created by how easy Eve is with instant local and perfect intel. It was hard to hunt so hunters got good. It was easy to krab so krabbers didn't.
---
Now both are hard so krabbers who keep learning will get better.
---
Well for one thing you are talking about log off traps and i am talking about bot networks using gate bots instead of local bots....
---
NPC trade hub taxes should be highers as the SEC of the systems get. You want to be safe (LOLOL) get yo Jita, Amarr, etc. If want to pay less as a buyer or seller, get to lower secs. Risk/reward.
---
You can make blackmarkets too. I don't know, for example make abyssal modules ilegal on "x" SEC sistems and only can buy on NPC Null or very low trade hubs. It gets you content, money, and can be roleplayed/lore into the game.
---
stfu krab you will not be in peace
---
Old aura reminded me that the universe truly didn't give a shit. Oddly comforting.
---
Or just don't generate the killmail for 30 mins.
---
There is only one way to find out if it is viable: Anchoring that structure in space and see what happens.
---
Basically you will have four groups of players:
---
1. Players that will ignore the station. This is probably the biggest group, most of the people who cross through that system will be on their way to or back from Jita. No threat, but also no customers.
---
2. Players that will use your stations services. Depending on how many those are and what they going to sell, others might occasionally visit your market as well, some might even put up their own orders. Expect that number to be very low at the start and only to increase slowly.
---
3. Players who just want to kill the structure for fun. Killing a structure through three timers isn't actually that exiting, so you should probably be fine. Maybe some people from group two decide to defend the place they do business as well.
---
4. Players who think you are competition and want to remove you. This might actually be a good thing, because it means group number two is big enough to at least pay for the fuel cost (and maybe part of the structure) and your place is popular enough that people might want to help to defend it.
---
Maybe I live in some magical parallel EVE where this happens and people who say it will not last long are right but like I said, the only way to really know is to try. Good luck and keep us posted, been a while since we had an ongoing series from a solo pilot on this sub.
---
I think subcap tether in general isn't really needed and citadel defenses should only be active if the citadel itself is getting attacked. But removing tether in some cases (like low power) is just gonna end up being confusing and a pita while not bringing anything to the game really.
---
That's still a big amount of Intel. You can know who is active, if there are active wormholes open, if the inhabitants fight back, with what ships and fits, you can tell when they are active and when they aren't...
---

Looks like a good fight, I'm sorry I was at work and missed it.
---
Why no? It would be a nice dynamic to fueled and unfurled structures?
---
&gt;but please give me suggestions
---
Donate some ISK to me?
---
Adapt
---
Yeah I get ya but it might be fun to see if they bring in PIRAT or whomever to help defend. At the very least you can get some shiny killmails and laughing at PIRAT.
---
Or you can try it on an alt corp and toon, and see how far you can get?
---
But structure timer shouldn't automatically put it into low power.
---
One day I'll work out if your a real person or not. One day.
---
Don't remove asset safety.
---
&gt;No asset safety - you want asset safety, keep it fueled.
---
How handy that all structures are in low power once put into structure timer.

Ripped straight from EVE Uni website. Sleepers tend to be aggressive towards drones which is the main source of Myrm DPS - if you arent paying attention they'll get blapped. With a drake it's only light drones and the bulk of the dps comes from missiles anyways. The tank on a drake tends to be sturdier as well.
---
Does this mean we get to research counter measures as well like spies that lets us see everything every other player sees for 200 gold per villager?
---
You should be able to warp through a gate. Set destination to somewhere you want to go, and check in the route to see if all the jumps are squares or not. Sqaures are normal, traingles are invasions. If you jump from an invasion to a non-invasion system, they shouldn't be able to catch you leaving.
---
the difference is I'm not screeching like a retard unsubbing my accounts, I'm talking about it
---
Also bottom of the food chain lol ? That’s such bullshit , the majority ,matter fact whole alliances depend on pve players to exist! 
---
The whole idea of umbrellas defending there rorq,s , bottom of food chain my ass lol playing solo pvp is the bottom of food chain they bring 0 to the table other then ego and pride to the eco system of eve tsss !
---
You play good solo , good for you , yay great , that’s as far as the recognition should go.
---
Eve doesn’t evolve around how much solo or how good solo you are , your effect as solo pvp is minimal at best to the eco system of Eve.
---
wow such hate! good let the hate flow thru you.
---
***grr goons , fucking goons ruined my life.***
---
Show me on the obelisk doll where miniluv touched you.
---
Your strategy depends on what you’re flying. But always always always watch dscan and your overview. Make sure you can see combat scan probes on your dscan. Ideally the only things you see with your dscan filters are ships and probes, maybe mobile depots too. 
---
If you bring a heron or buzzard you’re going to have to rely on high situational awareness and quick reaction times. You’ll want to stay between 2000 and 2500m from your can so that you can cloak but still be able to gather loot without moving. Spam your DScan key and watch your overview. Some ships can warp cloaked and won’t decloak until they’re either in-warp to you or are at their engagement range to you, while others have to decloak prior to warp. Of course the latter is easier to spot with dscan. The former you’ll have to watch your overview. Get one like Z-S that makes other pilots stand out from other things, and hit that cloak button as soon as you see someone pop up. And don’t stay still! If they’re close they’ll just fly over to decloak you. Cloak up and fly away from obstacles. If you’re in a buzzard you can warp away while cloaked. 
---
If you fly an Astero or something else combat-capable this changes things. The above still applies, but you don’t need to be quite as scared. It depends how combat-averse you are, too. But with a ship that can fight, you’ll find that fewer people attack you in general, and when someone does you may stand a chance in defending yourself. Your astero won’t fend off a blingy Loki, but there’s lots of stuff it can fend off. 
---
If you’re able, you can also use an alt to haul your loot. As explo loot is not large, you can have an alt follow you in a travel-fit interceptor, or really any ship that can fit a cloak (ideally a covert cloak) and has a fast align time.  Travelceptor is ideal as it has a sub 2 second align time and is immune to interdiction bubbles. You clear sites in ship #1 while ship#2 sits somewhere safe. Once you clear your site, they rendezvous at your safe and you put loot in ship #2. Rinse and repeat. This way if you get tanked you’re only losing your ship, not your loot as well.
---
I wish they reworked the Jag into something not so one dimensional and boring
---
I think low power structures should sit in structure and not have a timer. If you go shoot it you can kill it in one go. Also I think structures shouldnt insta tether. I'm sick of fighting some one on a structure and the tether saves their pod so they can warp off.
---
I don't even think it should be delayed. All that does it prevent fights, which I'm against. CCP needs to stop listening to Reddit for advice and actually think through their actions. Delaying intel means it's harder to hunt, and harder to respond to hunters. Both of those things mean less content.
---
I get your thoughts but... its super easy to keep those things fueled :(
---
This wouldnt change a whole lot in eve i think. Maybe a hand full citadels would get killed/removed.
---
Tethering - Only available if you cant dock (or simply remove all subcap tether?)
---
Reinforcement timers - a stront timer as armor would be great but yeah low power citadels shouldnt be easier to kill probably
---
Asset safety - should always be 50% in null and 25% in low tbh... would create incentive to actually go kill shit
---
That's just not the design of the game. They are planning to make the new experience better, but total security to carebear and learn at your own pace is not Eve.
---
Eve expects you instead to join a corp that does PvP and learn through hanging out on comms and fleeting with them. In all honesty, the mechanics are such that having some vets explain things is super helpful. I've learned a TON in a month in a small lowsec alliance.
---
What you really said:  
---
&gt; REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
True statement my friend.
---
FCON leadership was shit we know. It's not like we're pretending things weren't bad. Our head FC decided to keep our supers in Branch knowing we'd lose them all. And we lost them all. Surprise. Goons poached majority of our major corps. We fielded a 600 man HFI + Sleipnir fleet prior so we had the man power. Had. Then apparently we felt like doing a social experiment or something where tiny alliances can join, contribute about two people to fleets and then for some reason have equal say in like... everything. Fitting team had people who didn't belong there, people who thought ACs on an ALPHA fleet made sense. And created doctrines around the mentality that we're going to lose anyway so let's just make them as cheap as possible. Then there was so much stupid political drama, protecting complete arse holes that honestly we should have just booted rather than going to war over. Then we were barred from trashing on reddit because 'muh high ground' which essentially meant people could make up any amount of lies and we weren't allowed to deny them. Who wants to join an alliance that won't even deny that they're the shittest alliance in the game? We couldn't recruit anybody but miners that only wanted to leech off the free shit we were giving in our dumb program. Then leadership was like fuck this it's your problem now and just AFKd it. The fact that Nour wasn't an amazing FC and yet got far more people in fleets than anybody else might suggest that he wasn't the spurge lord John wants to make him out to be. And he's not a trash tier FC either I've gotten out of most fights without a scratch flying with him so long as I do as he says. Certainly a better and more experienced FC than John is so I find the criticism somewhat amusing. All this mindless hate for one guy over what? I don't get it. And the consequences of that treatment has carried over. My friends in Tri told me to go fucking kill myself for not abandoning FCON to switch to the winning team. Like what the fuck that's cancer. I don't blame TEST for not saving us as agreed I got sick of FCON too. Kept dragging people into so much horse shit.
---
Pretty much this.  
---
If you want real time data, get boots on the ground in system.  Scout it out. 
---
 
---
Why should any side have perfect real-time data half way across the universe without anymore effort than pulling up a screen.  
---
That people are upset by this easy information going away only shows that it probably at least needs to be delayed enough to not be tactically useful.  
---
Delay all personal API data 12 hrs and all data regarding jumps in system, NPC kills, cyno, player kills and the like 6hrs.  Still enough info to look for trends in people and regions but not so much that you can’t hide your ratting, fleet move, op or gate camp.
---
To be fair, they also described making the new player experience better. Maybe they'll try to actually explain some systems better.
---
PushX says it is available to all.
---
I think that’s the point they’re making, that it would allow more opportunities for smaller groups to go unnoticed by the bigger blocs for longer periods of time- which could allow more interesting content than currently is available. 
---
The problem really is that no one has to actually watch anyone else when they can just look at zkill and see everything they’ve flown since the beginning. No one has to hunt when they can see exactly who owns give space and it’s activity level. 
---
Forcing players to actually do the legwork again may go a long way to dealing with those issues.
---
Like the tax increase hurts anyone except the newborns without the skills and isk to cover the new taxes. Stop making the game hard for new bros ccp.
---
Remove jumps per hour and players in system from the overview map in game when?
---
I mean, thanks for triggering.
---
Most t2 is up by 25%, t1 however is a different story.

---
Falcon is the real problem. Hilmar actually has a few braincells left still
---
A year later and still triggered.
---
in game information should be left alone, it's delayed already.
---
This is why I have always been in favor of actual delayed (10s?) local, not just complete blackout. Smaller groups would still have some chance to not get fucked in their own space that way.
---
What do you mean? It's active now.
---
In reference to the in game map/Dotlan. I think it would be good. Knowing the exact system where someone is doing an activity is just OP right now. There isn't even a plausible reason for it to exist. Think about it, you can't see that someone is in the same system with you, but you can tell that some nerd is killing rats from anywhere on the map?
---
Asset safety is smart.
---
Why should people know about gate camps so they avoid them? That's just destroying the game for campvpers
---
In 24 hours, any battle will be yesterday's news even before you can make a battle report about it.
---
Then you must have missed all the times we made him apologise for it. Nour was still probably the most popular FC in the alliance and leadership just dumped all their problems on a kid who was busy with exams. And every loss associated with FCON was then associated with him regardless of whether he was there or not. Things weren't exactly fair for him either.
---
If they touch it, you know it will be totally fubar'd. These ideas pulled out of Hillmar's ass, dictated from on high never turn out well at all. He's clueless about his own game, and needs to stay as far away from it as possible for the health of it. But they seem intent on running it into the ground for $$$, so be it.

counterquestion: null sec still broke ? ... I enjoy myself more in half broke faction warfare (my killboard will tell you) as in carebear space where allied get pissed cos i run relic site in their corner of space ... loled hard on this one.

I ask which system is more broken for pvp oriented game?

Rorq s are the pillars of the game fools !

Time to get a wife/husband?  This will bring some real challenges.
---
IRL you will learn what real aggro looks like.
---
In EvE it will feel like everything you are doing you do will accomplish with less time and focus available.
---
&gt; better roleplay goals, such as protecting or conquering space, contesting resources, or even vengeance
---
"better" is so subjective here.
---
Personally I literally do not care about conquering space. Many people don't. Holding sov is a burden.
---
Ratting's probably become too dangerous so beans making their isk by looting your wreck before you're dead.
---
vapor take it as a sportsman we just spiced up your boring sov defense which would have been uneventfull ... also you got a kikki kill ... so whats your damn prob with that Oo
---
Are you insane? Eve without goons would be boring. I love goons. There always has to be a bad guy.
---
I don’t think you understand the definition of the word slave.
---
There is a hole in the umbrella
---
Well Hillmar was talking about taxing or some other way of making you not rely only on NPC stations for storage, so we'll likely see another change that adds that.
---
Came back since it looks like CCP is doing something...
---
While I have only recently and briefly looked at my Proteus with a fit that's like 200PG and 20 CPU over...   I'm dreading actually trying fix the ship to something useful.   I fear that I'll be overwhelmed with the sadness when I try to fix it.
---
Yes, I'm sure the many hundreds of upvotes on those blackout posts were primarily from the game's incredibly small (and ever shrinking) roaming population.
---
Exploiting and controlling those resources, in addition to the best infrastructure bonuses are your benefit to being in Null.
---
The above bonuses are taken for granted, and the safety aspect is so common that it’s assumed. Just because you own space doesn’t mean you have a full-on border patrol limiting who gates in. Otherwise, take those twenty super pilots and go stick em on all your in-gates.
---
Instantly moving and applying the highest dps ships in the game against anyone in your space is the problem. Intel was a good start, now everyone has to work for it. Next we need caps to be forced to warp/gate around at least one to two times before they can land on an active combat grid.
---
I agree on the capitals. 
---
I’ve long been a supporter of removing killmails from the game because they’re lazy intel. Players should have to actively watch each other or groups they want to fight. That’s part of the legwork of intelligence. It also makes engagements more interesting when you aren’t flying a hard counter to whatever they’re flying because you looked on zkill at everything they’ve ever flown since the beginning of their character.
---
&gt;CCP needs to stop listening to Reddit for advice
---
This. Seriously.  This.  CCPls.
---
And yes i understand the irony, but still.  This.
---
Fighting against the tragedy eve has become is futile, but there's still time to enjoy the farce as it dies.
---
Fair point. Maybe ccp could restrict the information to constellations instead of individual systems? So you know roughly where things are happening but still have to go scuot to find out where exactly it is?
---
Good Lord, what have we come to? I am in agreement with a goon!  :-)
---
I came back last year... I was in tears
---
It is super easy to fuel these things.  Once a POS ran out of fuel it was effectively a dead stick, citadel structures should be similar.  If Corps wish to own these things they should accept that there needs to be upkeep to maintain them whether that fuel and / or stront for reinforce timers.
---
Right now there is little to no incentive to kill a structure, Citadel spam in eve is cancer and there needs to be a substantial overhaul of the existing mechanics which vastly increases risk versus reward.
---
Why is it a problem?  Shouldn't an entity holding sov be able to monitor their space and protect its residents?
---
When minmitar jump, a little piece of the ship should break off and stick around for 2 hours
---
Move to High sec then. I don't see what your comment has to do with Null. You made an in-game choice to store things in an unsafe area. Real life doesn't play into that. You could have stored it in high sec.
---
This will nerf alot of different playstyles not involving big blob fleet ops.
---
Horde, yeah, goons weren't attacking.
---
Its the map that needs fog of war...too much info there
---
I'm fine to just have a scorecard and no fitting information, fact is i've posted for that before
---
Adapt or die.
---
Not my experience of roamers, most want easy defenceless kills.  The second they get any hint of resistance they run and scream in complain in local of blobbing and only in it for fair fights.
---
That being said there are exceptions and in the past I've had some pretty fun fights with roaming fleets.
---
The rats warp in, deaccelerate, and then lock you. In an exploration frigate you could usually warp off as soon as you see them on your overview. BUT. It's very likely that you're currently hacking a can. So warping off makes that explode and kill you. In a cheap T1 frigate it doesn't matter too much and you can push your luck a bit. (if you blow up bookmark the site to come back and loot your wreck. No need to panic they don't pod you.) In an astero or T2 frigate only go for the one or two best cans. The other option is to tank the explostion and the rats for example in a stratios. Most other cruiser can tank it too if they are tanked.
---
Look at what happened to Providence.
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Providence#npc24
---
Not rich in caps, no umbrella to escalate with. Ratting activity has fallen off a cliff because subcaps have no defense against cloakies.
---
I wish you well in life, my friend.
---
Honestly that's your fault for being retarded, not the people you are trying to hunt in some low effort fit that you copy and pasted from Bjorn bees killboard.
---
No you?
---
They generate isk so there can be an economic system and besides that’s one fraction of the pve Eve offers.
---
And they also offer to be nice pvp targets.
---
But this post is about how you as solo pvp player even think to have the right to down play a ratter or think your better some how because (I can fly solo , me so good , me so pretty durrr , look at me yay yay yay durrr)
---
Yeah def not truth there
---
&gt; I am a new'ish player.
---
&gt; Everyone is whining about null being too safe. Ruining the game. Isn't that the whole point of sov? Why bother going through the effort and expense of establishing sov if you can't exploit the resources of the area, and protect those doing it? Isn't that essentially what Concord is doing in HS, only it's being run by players instead of AI?
---
I could probably stop there.
---
Sov might be about total safety or it might be about the unlimited utilization of resources.  In a good game design it can't be both.  Likely the safety shouldn't be there either, and it used to be it wasn't.  The best you could do in most sov systems before citadels was an Outpost, They were expensive and limited and you could lose those including being locked out of it.  After that there were POS's.
---
You are newish so totally safe unlimited resources seem normal to you in Eve.  Possibly you feel accomplished with all your assets and PLEXed accounts?  You aren't.  The game mechanics have allowed you to join and play Farmville.  Simcity would have more challenges and danger than you experience now.
---
That you still make so much isk at little risk means EvE is not yet EvE again.  We only wish it will be.
---
You can sell sleeper loot to npc buy orders, and you can still sell or reprocess loot from other npcs.
---
Lately? LATELY?
---
Lately I had, for several seconds, contemplated going back to EVE.
---
Then I immediately remembered the new Aura, how they made tracking values fucking useless, the cringeworthy singleplayer NPE... and I got better
---
I am a newbro and I feel inadequate! Jokes aside, been playing a little over a month and just wish I could contribute more in fights, limited on my skills still tho. State of the game? I am new, happy to be here and have a new found obsession so thats a tiny problem.
---
Yeah warping to a wormhole in a space you police daily is so hard. /s
---
thing is hunters can make a channel and just post kills there
---
Wrong use of meme
---
ccplz remove overview
---
Like I said, what I was referring to was the long term, assuming local stays gone and groups continue to adjust.  
---
While the blackout has been a net positive for pvp so far, it's unlikely to stay that way if null alliances take the most logical steps available to defend themselves (something they care a lot more about than giving good fights).
---
As some of the people here have said, Eve might be a space game, but it is not solitary.
---
For a new player, joining a corporation is almost required. You don't have to join a pvp focused one, but trying to learn the ropes by yourself is a massive task and should not be attempted by any but the most insane of individuals. Trying to go at this game alone is what burned me out the first time.
---
Judging by your reference to the crime-watch system, you probably got ganked in HS, either while mining or hauling and did not have a support system to help tell you what went wrong and/or how to avoid it.
---
Rule of thumb is: don't mine in a covator, retriver, hulk, or mackinaw. Those are too expensive and can be ganked with few enough ships to make it profitable. Use a procurer, these pack more tank and take more catalysts than is profitable and will be fairly safe in HS. For hauling, don't break 150mil isk/10k ehp in your hauler (the gank tornadoes are \~150mil isk fit and will want to make enough isk to buy another one after concord kills them)
---
If you are intent at sticking in HS, look for a newbro friendly corp to help show you the ropes, or take the sting out of losing a ship. One group I can recommend (used to fly with them while I was looking for a wormhole group to go back to) is the Hogs Collective, they do a bit of everything is HS: mining, ganking, war-deccing, mission running, ect. and are more than willing to help people learn. Tell them Zap sent you. Recruitment channel is: AirHogs
---
If Lowsec catches your fancy, join Faction War and ask for some help in the militia chat, I have not interacted with FW beyond roaming through looking for content but they mine, mission, and pvp there.
---
If NullSec is where you want to end up, join a block and dive on in, Karmafleet, Brave newbies, Pandemic Horde, and D-Reddit come to mind here.
---
For wormholes, Spoopy Newbies is a great group for learning the ropes but in genreal, most wormhole corps will expect that you know the basics of the game.
---
Tank him?
---
You mean like your in-game decision to keep all your shit in a station in a PvP space while your corporation is at war with dozen enemy corporations?
---
More than a clone bay.
---
You can play casually in highsec. Or NPC nullsec.
---
If they nerf the umbrella you will probably lose EvE.
---
At least we have reason to undock :D
---
Yhea i understand that. It somehow what used to happen with my gila.. drones would suffer.
---
In terms of pvp..would i be more dangerous with a myrmidon , right?
---
Couldnt i fit a jump so i can get out of warp disrupter?
---
I think thats like a stable for pvp in WH
---
CCP: Let's shake it up and take away intel.  
---
Elite PVPer: Yea, no free intel because it's too powerful for others!  
---
Null sec: Don't take away local, it's intel.    
---
Elite PVPer: Get gud scrub.  
---
Also CCP: Let's shake it up more and take away some more intel.  
---
Elite PVPer: No, wait.. I need that free intel because I use it!
---
Killmails are necessary but should be delayed and not instantaneous, the longer the better 24 HR is good, to put a damper on people coming to whore on battles, but the perfect intel of dotlan and the in-game map is pretty overpowered and silly. It helps crabbers avoid gate camps, and anyone sneaking expensive cargos around null which should become a killmail much more often. 
---
The same goes for hunters, there has to be some effort put into finding active systems manually especially now that krabs can't see trouble comming. This log in, check map for activity, fly to system for kills is a bit overpowered and I love the idea of having to search through areas in packs of scouts to find content for the main gang that could be forming up.  Right now it's stupidly easy and in our alliance people are already burning out. 
---
This adds a level of chaos to pvp that the game is lacking. It's not eve right now
---
That after blackout i was all hyped up and begin roaming null, just to find out that some null regions are just empty spaces with no soul around and wasting an hour jumping from gate to gate just to be killed by a supercarrier
---
Why don't you just make low power structures automatically explode.
---
Those were the days
---
I was not onboard with local blackout and I still think it makes things like mining incredibly difficult but if you're going to blackout Intel don't do it half-assed and do it full ass with delayed esi Intel too.
---
This one for one time had a good fit!
---
Nah, let's go full black out just like local. Delay is for the weak.
---
Nice self bio done in picture format.
---
Cut taxes because that always solves problems too.
---
what defines income? i move isk from one toon to another. will it get taxed? 
---
i mine/refine/sell at what point will you tax it as income tax?
---
i pillage a wreck of a ship for loot, will i get taxed at that moment or at moment of sale?
---
do we make yearly filings?
---
Damn straight
---
Fly safe.
---
Monitor and protect is great, but instantly jumping a massive cap fleet anywhere in your space for any frigate etc at any time is silly. If you want TOTAL space control, you need to be sitting on every single in-gate with bubbles.
---
50/50 on this. Forces a fight....
---
100% do it.
---
He's an interesting streamer for sure, but i don't think i have alot in common with him, he flies a complete different spectrum of ships. No idea how you came up with that comparison ... hmmmm :O
---
This would be more of an r/evetech question, but as far as I am aware, there is no public contracts endpoint in ESI
---
There is it's called asset safety. Post blows up anything in hangers or such is ejected. Citadel blows up non wh it goes to either a low sec station or you can send it to another place in system.
---
so a roaming gang can make a  tactical decision on data as to where to go but the defenders can't?
---
I think the argument is that you should have to keep the citadel's fueled to have those benefits. As it is letting a citadel go low power right now still affords asset safety, tether, and one reinforcement cycle...
---
What do you do with that ore that it isn't being taxed?
---
Ph is not far from jita.a little bit more than before in germinate; but still close. Dekklein not far too. I always go solo vs big blob; it s the fastest way to have infinite content. And yeah sometimes you will be dropped but as solo it doesnt happen so much. Lsst time i get dropped it was in low; and by a vendetta vs my oracle.
---
Thats one fraction pve offers yes, but it looked like its your fraction ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
Also you're pretty good at generalization for being so critical of something that is essentially generalizing.  
---
1/10 hypocritical trollpost, next please.
---
That's handable by have a flag in the db was online yes then asset safety no them no safety.
---
Null groups have always huddled together in highly concentrated groups, leaving most of space empty most of the time. I fail to see how your prediction would be fundamentally different from the status quo of the last 10 years since I've been playing. 
---
The silver lining is, and has always been, that if the players are all concentrated in a few spots then you don't have to waste time going looking for them. 
---
Nullsec blackout makes it much more viable to go hunting right under their noses though. You just have to do quick hit and runs and not give them time to respond. This is somewhat business as usual too, but you used to have to factor in a group of guys actively trying to chase and corner you. Now they just respond when you attack, which gives you at least 30-60 more seconds.
---
RIP small time manufacturing. GTFO if you can't source yourself or via contract.
---
I don't feel accomplished.  What I have achieved has totally been on the shoulders of others.  I recognize that.
---
I also recognize that this is not the same game as it once was.  It has evolved.  For the better, or the worse?  Depends on who you ask, I suppose.
---
Eve already has a problem with retaining new players.  New players are critical for the sustained health of any game.  New mechanics help keep it fresh.
---
Would I agree that there's way too much structure spam?  Sure.  Would I agree that maybe things have gotten a little too stagnant?  Sure.  
---
But changes have to be balanced somehow.  What happens if, say, we nerf mining to oblivion?  All well and good (unless you consider that now you can build a lot less - how will ships be replaced?  How will new players get new ships?) - but what about the people who spent a lot of time skilling into mining?  Oh well, so sad for you that you spent a year of training to get that rorq, it's worthless now...
---
You almost make it sound as though you feel that there sould be no reward.  Sure, let's let 5 frigates wipe out a capital because we've made it weak and no-one can respond.  Bleh.
---
There is no "total safety" despite what you might want to pretend.  Stupidity will still get you killed.  "I got this" will still get you killed.  "I bit off more than I can chew" will still get you killed.  People get killed in Delve every day - in pretty much every tier of ship.  Is it perhaps a bit too safe?  Maybe.  But there needs to be some balance.
---
Even an hour would make the intel you gather from it almost useless
---
I'm sorry my facts are too much for you. You are pretty much my impression of the average FCON linemember tho so thanks for reinforcing that stereotype for us all :)
---
Yet

Things weren't fair for anyone. Look at literally anyone who FCed in PFED. Wildkins? Anveri? John Baylin? Mogilla? Everyone had to deal with the same shit from FCONs afk "skyteam". They all had to deal with leadership putting undue pressure on them. Nour Samy is one of the few who took it out on everyone around them.
---
Will keep you posted, but first I need to get that 5bil for the azbel. Could take a few weeks.
---
Yes, but all things are funny when communists do them. I can't explain it and I don't approve of it, but it is objectively true.
---
One you can remote asset safety two this is fixable just make anything on market asset safety three make off lining the market service a timer ie I click offline and it has a 2 or 3 day countdown before turning off or it's in a few days of fuel left sends evemails and notifications to those using said station for stuff. Again this is all fixable more so by making abuse bannable right off the bat as well.
---
Don’t feed the beans after midnight
---
Not with either of those fits really. Your best defense is watching D-scan and warping out whenever you see something spooky show up. A Microjump drive could save you but if you get scrammed then its all over.
---
you know there are 3 other types of ewar, all of which much stronger then ECM ever was.
---
Not enough slots is a good thing in my book. Gotta choose what to sacrifice; safety or utility.
---
There's one glaring issue with this, however. If the armour timer goes, a structure becomes unpowered. So all structures would be without asset safety, damage cap or even hull timer.
---
Smart Russian Government Guy: Can't steal your money it it wasn't yours in the first place.  
---
Me: \*cries in Russian\*
---
So basically you think jump drives should be done away with completely?
---
Hunt and kill another AT ship
---
&gt;If hunters can't be seen in local why should hunters see ratters in the map anywhere in the universe? It's hilarious seeing those want local removed now spinning their heads in this thread. They don't want a better eve. They only want their own activity to made easier. 
---
Precisely. 
---
They want intel and safety to favour them. That's why so many
---
* Don't want local to show them, but want to see how many people are ratting or mining in a system.
---
 * roam in Lokis/covert ops ships in numbers, but complain about caps. 
---
* Only engage targets they can kill with ease, and lose their shit when someone drops ships that will kill them with ease.
---
The yellow skin movement.
---
CCP sell more yellow skins.
---
Now that's just not true at all. Agree to disagree.
---
How does this hurt small groups more than large? It's just a maintenance cost that scales with the number of structures.
---
IMO having the tether on a timer would hurt the small groups more, as they'd absolutely need to step up to a fortizar to secure a capital ship for more than a few minutes... So RIP any small group using astra's for a cyno chain
---
Wormholes don't have a dotlan activity heatmap to find targets and it works out fine.  Heck, the connections between systems (Stargates) make it easier than WH to find someone.  Give killmails a delay.  Dotlan info, maybe 24 hr delay or rolling average of stats per system.  Should actually play they gave to find stuff to do.
---
Move afk stuff to npc station and then nuke it. Also remove tethering.
---
Make Eve more Eve.
---
arent they hiking taxes because they want to move people from npc stations to citadels?
---
what is the goal here? will they remove npc stations in high/low sec? i just dont understand this. then what. only citadels remain with high sec having asset safety and low/null not having it? if at least they said outright the vision ...
---
This hardly effects me, I just think it's dumb and bad design. To say it'll create conflict would be flat out incorrect.
---
Dam, messed up the title.
---
u/VredditDownloader

Gallente and Caldari generators are used in super capital fights.
---
Haha! Of course my first silver is on my work account. XD Thank you, kind player!
---
You're also putting 65 billion isk on the battlefield to be dropped on by a dread bomb that can be replaced cheaper than the titan to die. I think it's pretty safe to say a 250 man sub cap fleet wouldn't need a Titan on grid to boost them as command ships do it well enough to take that role for less than a billion isk. And putting just 1 titan on the grid would be asking to get bombed

They should never have allowed supers/titans to dock in keepstars.
---
Is it unpopular opinion to not like that mechanics? If I blow a station up I should be able to get the loot no?
---
Leviathan and Erebus generators are very good.
---
It's called people being stupid enough to fall for it deserve it. Down in synd in I think fd or xm someone runs a cyno trap and an MTU trap the pos is near the npc station so people being stupid have a habit of going oh cyno on station and warp into a manned death star they get what the deserve.
---
A lot of these "l33t pvp hunters" won't even fight you when ratters switch to pvp subcaps lol. They're pathetic af.
---
Perhaps there needs to be a caveat. 
---
If the structure has fuel then asset safety still applies even in its low power mode due to entering structure.  
---
If no fuel in the bay then no asset safety.
---
Also no additional fuel can be added to the structure once reinforced.
---
Too much information is available in this game, and it can affect the gameplay of many.
---
Just the fact that you cannot choose to NOT be in a killboard can make many players risk-averse, so that they can avoid the shame gained by any failed PVP tentative or occasion. Some others e-peen players already decided that for you : you will be in whatever you think. Best thing that CCP can do, is to provide an option to hide the player name who activate it in all future lossmails AND killmails after a 24/48 hours delay, but not his corp/alliance to keep the intelligence part.
---
Dotlan... Well, it is just an easier way to analyze the data provided by the ingame map. So unless CCP want to nerf the ingame map too, it won't be fair to nerf the ESI and so all tools.
---
Under the new tax regime, there is a new cost to doing business in NPC stations.
---
There certainly needs to be an increased risk attached to player structures to balance reduced costs.
---
when thousands of transactions take place in perimeter, It doesn't take long for one's initial stock ( being rotated ) to make the replacement cost lower than the taxes one would have incurred.
---
so a complete removal of asset safety for structures under attack could be considered the cost/risk of doing business. However for structures that have owners playing the lockout game, or people unexpectedly away from game, asset safety to a nearby NPC station when the station loses shield or manually triggerable if option is PREVIOUSLY selected, should simply have a 50% asset transfer service for interbus to move it- (sorry not enough freighters available at short notice) - if an previous instruction was left with them to do so (tick box option) when under attack/lockout. the rest remains in structure to drop to the loot fairy.
---
Of course players could choose to tick this box for a pre-accepted risk of loss, or accept the higher risk and maybe save money by successfully defending the structure or lose it all.
---
This shouldn't be only Null/losec this should be all space. Even HS.
---
It's absolutely mindboggling how few people have this mentality towards games they play.
---
Marco
---
Cynos should be live streamed. They're literally supposed to be "bright" enough for a jump drive to lock onto them from several light years away.
---
Hmm always works for me. Is it by chanced pinned? There's a little pin button next to the account.
---
Okay, that's a fair criticism. The temporary tether is kinda like the 30sec HIC point for aggressive a structure (not saying tether needs to be capped at 30sec). 
---
What would you say to a temporary tether on all structures, upgradable to a lasting tether via Service Module?
---
I suppose that larger blocs have both better logistic chains and better ability to defend larger structures. A hypothetical lasting tether might need to scale with structure size by some combination of fitting and fuel cost.
---
It’s not being punished. Your being coddled. Those ships should be destroyed or dropped. But they’re worried the casual players couldn’t handle that, so they give you a chance, for a fee, to get your stuff back.
---
I do think full asset safety is a little silly as well. Maybe have some stuff randomly drop would be a good idea since isnt lore that npcs transport your stuff they shouldn't be able to move it all.
---
I can tell you one thing - if you want to learn PvP, you have to change your views on the game. This game is hardcore mode for solo players, especially when they are new. Joining a corp helps that a lot because there's just too many things to learn alone. As for the crime part, you won't find any place where it's safe in eve. So learning to be vigilant, always be on alert to get out whenever shit hits the fan or take on the attackers and fight for your life is a must in this game. If you die - shrug it off, analyze what mistakes you made, write a message to the attacker what you should have done differently. 9 times out of 10 they will respond to you and give you some tips
---
It doesn't work like that though. I'm not even super engaged anymore and i can tell you who lives in every region in the game mostly from brs and stuff posted on reddit. Theres nothing on dotlan I couldn't get from the ingame map or half an hour of scouting on a neutral ceptor alt.
---
The timescale smaller groups could go unnoticed for I promise you is measured in a single digit number of days, not weeks or months.
---
Every ship sucks at some things and kicks ass at others. There are no "best ships".
---
Welcome back, ships are in a much better place now balance wise. Subcaps that is. Caps are still op and if that’s your thing null blocs are recruiting. Perhaps tech 3’s have a clear winner in the Loki but other then that I fly all the things!
---
Either that or as "porkie", depending on the artist. "Porkie" is an obese pig in a suit and top hat smoking a cigar.
---
PL #1 Albion corp, so many cabbages to farm
---
Who are you and what did you do with StainGuy?!
---
....or you simply had a moment of amnesia and forgot this: 8. Lowsec gate to Stain.
---
If you lose everything because any one of those things happen, you fucked up long before they happened.
---
But citadels were literally envisioned as a replacement for POSes, right? Jesus Christ. So many dumb people think having to actually move your shit around is the literal same thing as a "Teleport my shit to lowsec" button.
---
Sure, you could play it safer and have to live your life on the fringes of low sec.
---
Unpowered astras shouldn't do anything. Powered astras should only tether subcaps. Fortizars should only tether subcaps and regular capitals. Keepstars should be needed to tether supers. Moon citadels should only tether industrial ships.
---
Small scale pvp there is also falling off, I used to roam there with a Hecate and I’d usually bring a new player with me to get them interested in smallgang/solo pvp (I was in PH). Now, I have gotten a few fights, but mostly I find a whole lot of nothing, and the occasional t3c stalking me.
---
Roaming ANYWHERE in nullsec be like that. I went out to Hispania's pocket last night in a solo AF. Ram jags for days, bunch of dictors, rapier support. Jesus guys.
---
They still couldn't even catch me.
---
The assault frig rework was really a double edged sword. We got some nice solo kiters, but they also became these crazy fast overtanked tackle ships of doom.
---
All these people wanting this probably also won't to hurt the big groups... GO FOR IT!! 
---
The only groups that could handle this kind of boot on the ground Intel ARE the big null blocks.
---
Perfect example is goons with their NGSA group, if you hate goons and wanting to hurt them by trying to make it harder to gather Intel your only screwing yourselves in the end. 
---
You guys can't see the forest for the trees.
---
This. I'm not actually watching netflix when I'm mining, more using it as background noise to keep me from getting distracted and ganked. That or I mute ocean documentarys and place the Odyssey is Space spotify list on top of it.
---
&gt; Dotlan stats are not available in wormholes after all.
---
And that's why you don't roam wormholes and conflict only happens if people happen to run into each other while patrolling the chain.
---
....why are they in geminate....they did get the memo we moved right?    can't exactly bring in fax from TKE to gemi.....
---
not gonna be any srp from this....
---
Why would you put all your shit somewhere that will be gone in a few days with no notice?
---
And yes, if you're committing all of your assets to a remote corner of null sec and you're _planning_ an absence of two weeks you should consider possible state of your home when you return.
---
Snitches get stitches
---
I'm becoming more and more convinced that 3 or 4 months ago, either Hilmar had some sort of mind altering experience, or he and CCP Falcon became drinking buddies...
---
Wait Nour left TEST? Thank fucking Christ.
---
Don't forget contracts
---
Seems like Wormholes could use more risk, after all, they make up close to 30% of the PvE isk faucet.
---
So, over the past week I have opened the EVE client once to update it.  
---
Annnnd....  That's all.  
---
GL HF Fly Safe!
---
if I deselect 'Remember Account' the pin is gone but when I restart launcher account is still there and pinned again :/
---
Win the AT. 😂
---
I know what mobile jump unit do but how we're they used in this situation?
---
Were they used (or intended to be used) to move the rorqs 100 km and avoid tackle?
---
aaaaah....!  well, im still kinda new-ish, so yeah.. actually the first time ive heard it :)
---
At the same time, removing asset safety hurts small groups more than the big ones. Back in the day if your station got flipped, you fire saled or waited, changed corps, what ever, the stuff was still there and you could do something about it.
---
You remove the mechanic completely and you push more people to finding the next safest option which would be goons/panfam/test... Up the tax rate to make it hurt more to recover (which is also an isk sink since that money disappears), but I think removing it entirely doesn't help the alleviate the blue donut issue at all
---
thats where the new taxes came from, dont open it again pls
---
Eh imo that was before the blackout though. Provi was already pretty dead for a few months before summer for roaming.
---
i wish my carrier could kite. angel caps when?
---
&gt; Now we're a socialist dictatorship and the most powerful group in the game.
---
I wouldn't really call it as Socialist Dictatorship, closer to a welfare capitalist autocracy like Singapore. After all, the Alliance doesn't own the Rorquals and ratting Nyxes.
---
This is a really important point with dotlan. That and industry index are how we determine what's worth hunting when rolling wormholes. Taking that away just makes space far too safe for ratters and miners. It's not at all hurting pve or defensive means, it's only going to make creating content all the harder.
---
Yeah, I get that you can't just turn off asset safety tomorrow and the game will immediately be as it was before citadels. Other related things have changed.
---
For people that won eve two years ago and decided to come back and suddenly care about their shit, I'm sure there are ways to manage all their shit potentially being gone. "I don't have a solution to the problem right now." isn't a reason to dismiss trying to tackle it.
---
*Stainguy sweating intensifies"
---
Blackout
---
I miss O-V days. Shit was fire
---
You can boost before bridge though right?
---
So whenever I want to do something else for a while I should courier everything to a npc station on the off chance that I might lose litteraly everything I own while I'm gone? 
---
This is a game lol, some people play this for fun and would like to do other shit from time to time
---
Cool idea, let's not ever finish it
---
For mining, it depends on what you are trying to do.
---
Do you have an umbrella? Rorqual.
---
Are you in HiSec planning on going AFK while you mine? Orca.
---
Are you going to be at the keyboard and preferably boosted? Exhumer.
---
Are you going for gas or ore in hostile environments? Prospect.
---
Are you going for ice in hostile environments? Endurance.
---
Can you not fly those ships yet? Barge for ore/ice, Venture for gas, not having Industry V, or it being too dangerous to fly a ship as slow as a barge or command ship.
---
What kind of barge? Covetor if you have boosts. Procurer if there's risk of attack. Else, Retriever. Same applies to the equivalent Exhumers.
---
If anyone is interested, I may have some "Dawn of liberation" skins for sale to commemorate the occasion! :D
---
Chance occurrence. Most times if you maintain transversal or simply warp off shits not scary.
---
💪🦀💪🦀💪🦀💪🦀💪🦀💪🦀💪🦀💪🦀
---
No to all of that.  That would be less Eve not more Eve.
---
Tbh you're the internet tough guy in this scenario.
---
I'm not the one that thought that information should be removed. I'm the one who eventually stops dcanning because i'm bored as fuck and hoping someone will jump me so theres a fight going on.
---
yeah horde space isnt the best for roaming anymore
---
Here's a secret they dont tell you in newbro school, when you're hiding inside your friendly fleet of cruisers in your cute little slasher staring at the fight in awe, start smashing drones. The cruisers cant really lock or apply to them, but your web and autocannons will crush them to bits. you should be able to kill 10 a minute, and every time you kill one you're removing DPS from the enemies fleet. you'l know you're doing it right when they send hammerheads after you lol
---
[Here's an old AAR I did after doing exactly that with a firetail](https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/3dbwyu/eve_tale_of_a_firetail/)
---
You do realise that the ships you fly are built by people who mine, right?
---
Its like there's people that enjoy ganks and people that enjoy taking on a response fleet..........
---
Agreed.
---
I mean, maybe it used to be better, but I was getting a lot of fights just flying my Hecate around 9uy and the surrounding systems.
---
Can attest. Hi-sec is spooky as fuck. It's like we all have a miniature version of PTSD
---
what is "go on top horizontally" ?
---
Provi was a bunch of jackdaws the other night.
---
Agreed, low power should NOT have tethering.  Just always seemed silly to me.
---
The in game map would need to be reworked in a similar fashion, and frankly should probably only really show sec status anyway. The whole metrics for ships killed, jumps in last x time, etc are again lazy intel. 
---
And sure you could tell eventually who lives where, but the information wouldn’t be near instantly updated, which again is kind of the point. In truth nullsec should function exactly like w-space for information purposes.
---
dunno man. can't say because i've never been in a nour fleet, but i can say from experience that people generally don't join fleets they don't want to be in, and if a group doesn't have any fleets at all that a pvper wants to join, they will move on
---
How else are they supposed to get their massive payouts from PA in October after not paying any attention to the playerbase in years
---
&gt;ZoMg gAmE iS stAgNanT dO soMeThInG CcP

---
you dont have to post daily, no one cares
---
Okay, or instead of being a child, how about we discuss what makes a better game or better mechanic
---
&gt; in longer it would only make it worst as the only people with structures are big players capable of fielding multiple 255 man fleets.
---
you're gonna have to elaborate here otherwise i'm gonna go ahead and label this as a non-issue/dumb complaint
---
if you have enough people to field a 255 man fleet you can definitely have structures. i've seen groups that can barely field 20 people deploy and defend structures.
---
if you can't afford (or be bothered) to fuel a structure, you don't deserve to have a structure. it's the same principle as sov - if you can't defend it, you don't deserve it, and someone will come and take it from you
---
In game data such as the map statistics should be skill based, not delayed. I do agree on delaying that data to 3rd party software/websites though. The skills for map stats could be race based, example: Amarr Stargate Network Intelligence Level 5, Galnet Intrusion Level 5 etc.
---
How do u cheat in eve ?
---
At least not enough to respond to the thread, aye?
---
you
---
lmao gottem
---
THANK. YOU.
---
If it's also adding 4th slot in small structures, I'm fine with that, sacrificing that slot for more utility. 
---
Otherwise it's just a nerf to any small corp that want to do their own thing.
---
Up till probably like April or May you could reliably get fights but when I'd go out after that it was just a ghost town every time for 40 jumps. Only thing you'd end up finding was the occasional large gate camp but that would fuck off the second you brought anything that could fight it. This is like late ish ustz so maybe it's different in other tzs but content in general there had dried up quite a bit. Then we moved to wormholes and it's content city around the clock baby.
---
It got a short duration for its cost + its boosts the enemy aswell , especially shield and armor HP u don’t want to give your enemy
---
its not a hard solution, its one thats been passed to csm, that csm has passed to the devs, and one that iv seen directly passed to devs from players. Make citadels have a dye slot. Have LP stores sell citadel dyes. Its a fitting module. Problem solved, isk sink added. and there are how many different lp stores? Add more to drops and holy fucking shit, brand new valuable skin market.
---
Pist, hey buddy, you want a t2 bpo?
---
I think it should be delayed by the system security in the current system, I.E an additional 30 seconds for a 0.0 and add an additional 30 seconds for each increase in system security in local, once that time has gone you can see names in the system. Gives enough time for the hunter, and gives enough time for the intel community to map peoples movements if they actively watching gates. 
---
I don’t think Null should be like WH space with no local, but I do believe it should be delayed beyond what high and low sec offer based around concords police system.
---
Hilmar really fucking hates the idea of people finding anything to do doesnt he, first the blackout so you waste hours of time trying to find something to kill outside of delve and now he wants to take away what little info we have to find the 6 active systems in all of nullsec? wew lad
---
&gt; So whenever I want to do something else for a while I should courier everything to a npc station on the off chance that I might lose litteraly everything I own while I'm gone?
---
How often do you leave the game for weeks when all your shit is in one contested structure? 
---
This is a game lol. If life interferes for long stretches all the time I bet you got more important things going on than worrying about some virtual assets.
---
Both can be formidable if fit correctly.  Domi will usually pack nuets and worst case that mirm is a triple rep fit.  Don’t engage if they’re in pairs due to strong rr potential as well.  Best bet is to defang them similar to how you do a carrier.  Killing drones eliminates majority of the dps.
---
I'm curious why 25% low and 50% null and not the other way around?
---
No, but I think that having something like a randomized local grid (near star) for each ship cyno destination would be beneficial. 
---
This way, everyone know cap warp ins will be coming from the local star. It means subcaps have to fight for grid control to bring your caps in (bubbles). It means that after jumping the caps would have to align and warp to combat grid, instead of just instantly arriving on combat grid and applying.
---
This is going to be an interesting thread to keep an eye on :)
---
Roleplay?
---
&gt; We fielded a 600 man HFI + Sleipnir fleet prior
---
no you didn't. did you misplace a zero here
---
&gt;tiny alliances can join, contribute about two people to fleets and then for some reason have equal say in like... everything
---
&gt;Fitting team had people who didn't belong there, people who thought ACs on an ALPHA fleet made sense.
---
&gt;created doctrines around the mentality that we're going to lose anyway so let's just make them as cheap as possible
---
this is literally the guiding principle behind welpcanes and suicide dreads. it's very valid tbh
---
&gt;Then there was so much stupid political drama, protecting complete arse holes that honestly we should have just booted rather than going to war over
---
&gt;Then we were barred from trashing on reddit because 'muh high ground' which essentially meant people could make up any amount of lies and we weren't allowed to deny them
---
not being able to poast on reddit is something i would 100% leave a group in eve over (and have)
---
but earnestly engaging with retards on reddit who make shit up about your alliance is never a good look tho
---
&gt;Who wants to join an alliance that won't even deny that they're the shittest alliance in the game?
---
people still join SMA for some reason, idk
---
&gt;We couldn't recruit anybody but miners that only wanted to leech off the free shit we were giving in our dumb program
---
recruiting exclusively these kinds of people is problematic, but the mistake you made was not requiring them to pvp
---
&gt;Then leadership was like fuck this it's your problem now and just AFKd it
---
&gt;The fact that Nour wasn't an amazing FC and yet got far more people in fleets than anybody else might suggest that he wasn't the spurge lord John wants to make him out to be
---
either that or your alliance had a lot of people emotionally invested in it, and nour's fleets were annoying but bearable enough that they were willing to put up with them in order to feel like they were doing something to help FCON
---
&gt;And he's not a trash tier FC either I've gotten out of most fights without a scratch flying with him so long as I do as he says
---
doesn't necessarily mean he's a good or a bad fc
---
&gt;Certainly a better and more experienced FC than John is so I find the criticism somewhat amusing.
---
also not particularly relevant. you don't need to be an fc to know what makes a good one or a bad one
---
&gt;My friends in Tri told me to go fucking kill myself for not abandoning FCON to switch to the winning team. Like what the fuck that's cancer
---
tri has always been cancer. no surprises here
---
&gt;I don't blame TEST for not saving us as agreed I got sick of FCON too. Kept dragging people into so much horse shit.
---
like i said - PF was the coalition that shouldn't have existed
---
So basically they will deploy the MJU, and be jumped 100km, moving them out of them bubble and allowing them to use their jump drive to jump out. Alternatively, they could jump toward the Athanor on grid and be tethered. The ones that got away though, jumped system.
---
When you are looking for a way to fight citadel spam and are in dire need for an isk sink but refuse to charge for teathering....
---
Like they said, time for a little chaos
---
What we need is for cyno inhibs to cover the entire solar system or at least maybe 15 AU, and for the inhib to half the time of an active cyno.
---
for example, you land on a  ratting nix and drop an inhib, he lights a cyno before it finishes. Instead of him having 5 minutes for their allies to finish assembling their fleet of 5 FAX's and 18 supers, they have maybe two left at that point. So now instead of being able to just drop the whole fleet, they may need to send a frigate to burn in and get a new cyno point outside of the range of the inhib. With 15 AU range, sometimes that will be in the same solar system, sometimes it wont be. At any rate, the frigate gets the fleet on grid, then they have to warp to the fight instead of just appearing in the middle of he battle field. 
---
That's my 2 cents anyways.
---
&gt; The skills for map stats could be race based, example: Amarr Stargate Network Intelligence Level 5, Galnet Intrusion Level 5 etc.
---
you just created a barrier of entry for new groups to pvp
---
they need to have an "intel alt" available any time they want to pvp otherwise they're operating at a disadvantage over any larger organization that has one
---
That comment was a holocaust.
---
Fleet wide AOE ECM that disrupts fleet warps, aligns and broadcasts based on fleet number plz. 
---
People in the fleet need to pilot their shit, not align and press one single key.
---
[:crab:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5tjtUFL0j4)
---
Take a scram. They will have an mjd.
---
Thinking about changes to asset safety is giving me cold sweats 😓
---
Ooo. They should add in COMM Relays that players can knock down but in exchange get a massive bounty on their head (like Star Citizen does)
---
It's sad how risk averse everyone is. I'm honestly getting bored.
---
Abyssal mods remind me of rng weapon enhancement in black desert. Maybe next I can buy things to reroll ship stats to just be better than you. Maybe after that I can spend a few dollars to make the rolls more efficient , too
---
Yeah thats the point! And imo you're also right with the zkill topic and getting intel about what fitting the opponent is probably flying right now. Of course blackout reduces the time you can react by looking on zkill atm, but the possibility is there right now and I think this should also be prevented. Get the time you want to pvp more in direction of playing the game by looking at the enemy ship, his velocity etc. instead of luring players onto x amount of websites which contain informations about the game and things happening in it.
---
Remove all tether.
---
So I should care about the game enough to move my stuff if I need to take some time off, and if I don't care than fuck me I guess lmao
---
You really seem to struggle with the idea that some people don't play games 24/7 and want to take time off randomly from time to time
---
"recent"
---
North provi is always a bunch of jackdaws.  South provi you can sometimes get a fight.
---
Taxation is theft
---
You will be killed, then defiled, then killed again.
---
you're right, concord can go on strike, this should be fun :D
---
a kind of interpretation ;-)
---
Why dont you try and dual box afk vni?
---
there's a natural balance to pvp and pve that has to be maintained
---
you see it in nature, when prey animals flourish, predator animal populations start to rise until the prey populations diminish, then the predators die off too and the prey starts to flourish again
---
you need stuff to die otherwise the mined minerals deflate to oblivion and it becomes pointless to mine because nothing is worth anything
---
but you also need miners to be able to mine otherwise minerals inflate to infinity and nobody can afford anything because trit is 100isk and a rifter costs 20mil
---
I dont think thats true in the slightest. A random trophy does nothing at all, its the fun of doing the action that matters. Same reason achievements and shit have alwats boggled my mind why they were implemented in gaming, they are worthless.
---
&gt; Eve already has a problem with retaining new players. New players are critical for the sustained health of any game. New mechanics help keep it fresh. Sure, for many of you bittervets it's too easy now. "I had to go through all this, so you should to" is never a logical approach to anything. Would you rather just see the game die because there's no inflow of new players?
---
&gt; 
---
Eve has ALWAYS had a problem retaining new players.  NPE sucked and there were few good choices for players to turn to learn to be better.  Only EUni and Brave come to mind (I started in 2014).  And you learned lots of new things.  FW was still somewhat of a thing.  If you wanted to mine safely you did it in HiSec.  And it was a big f-cking deal to see your first Titan.  And that was super rare.  
---
&gt; Would I agree that there's way too much structure spam? Sure. Would I agree that maybe things have gotten a little too stagnant? Sure.
---
Of course they have gotten stagnant.  Players like you think unlimited resources with unlimited safety AND nullsec income levels are NORMAL.
---
&gt; But changes have to be balanced somehow. What happens if, say, we nerf mining to oblivion? All well and good (unless you consider that now you can build a lot less - how will ships be replaced? How will new players get new ships?) - but what about the people who spent a lot of time skilling into mining? Oh well, so sad for you that you spent a year of training to get that rorq, it's worthless now...
---
I finally get to tell someone to HTFU.  Shit has changed in this game since forever.  Everyone has had their preferred ship or income stream nerfed at some point.  if they nerf mining you will still be able to mine.  It will probably be worth more too.  Keepstar, cap and titan spam prove it became too easy to mine.
---
&gt; You almost make it sound as though you feel that there sould be no reward. Sure, let's let 5 frigates wipe out a capital because we've made it weak and no-one can respond. Bleh.
---
That is a strawman argument.  Not a real one.  And not that it shouldn't happen either.  The right gang of properly fit and flown frigates (even t1) SHOULD be able to kill an unsupported cap.  That you think it shouldn't isn't the game's problem.  Find videos where Iteron's kill combat vessels.  That a combat fit explorer can kill some of the ships that hunt it is not what is wrong with the game but what is right with it.
---
&gt; There is no "total safety" despite what you might want to pretend. Stupidity will still get you killed. "I got this" will still get you killed. "I bit off more than I can chew" will still get you killed. People get killed in Delve every day - in pretty much every tier of ship. Is it perhaps a bit too safe? Maybe. But there needs to be some balance. There has to be a way to draw in new players and let them think they can make it in the sandbox.
---
I think you just made the argument that your idea of keeping new players by funneling them all into playing Karma/PH version of Farmville isn't working.
---
MY CABBAGES
---
Was a good argument ever given towards WHY it also affects ships outside your fleet? I’m not a titan pilot, it just seems odd because yes it is a large SP and isk investment for such a silly module.
---
Then how are they gonna kill a rorq lol
---
Thats probably 6-7k dps between 12 bombers. Even a rorq with like a shield booster and a single t2 invuln can laugh that off.
---
Tell me what i see wrongly here.            
---
We have base groups like :          
---
* NCPL       
---
* PH       
---
* TEST        
---
* FRT       
---
* GOTG        
---
* Imperium      
---
* Snuff            
---
^(simplifying but you get the idea)          
---
Those groups will start hitting all possible non blue structures for asset drops.       
---
At the same time each of this group will have safe structures that they can defend. This will be just by share number of people they have or by getting enough allies.            
---
^(Sure stuff will die from time time - for example when goons will visit the drone lands a lot of stuff will burn)                
---
                 
---
But at the same time we will have a lot of smaller groups that are not blue or important to any of those big players.           
---
They will not be able to use structures as they will simply die quite fast.          
---
This will lead to many of those smaller groups to die out as members will need to join the big blocks to function "normally".
---
Daily reminder it's been 3 years and these things are oppressive as fuck
---
If someone with max skills has the information, they can instantly share it with 3rd party sites.
---
Either it should be delayed for everyone or nobody.
---
Yes we did. Last defence of Branch. 460 or so were FCON, 140 were from RZR. One fleet was FCd by a guy called Wolfpack or something I don't recall. RZR guy, great FC. Second fleet I don't know who FCd I was in the first. Then we had an overflow of about another 100 people we couldn't fit but were on standyby. So yes. We did. Reddit was rather congratulatory over that but gave us a lot of shit for never being able to replicate that again when we left CFC. I don't know what makes you so certain that we didn't.
---
What would each level of these skills impact? The amount of informations you get? The currency of the information? And why would you want to lock these informations behind a skills?
---
Imagine kunmi in his vni instead of sitting and saving retards.
---
Would you say the same applies if you want to cyno your friends in on my rorqs?
---
You know that you are wrong.       
---
Old VNI was also very dangerous when fit properly.             
---
Those are afk PVE drone boats.
---
Unlimited ore and construction slots bother me more.
---
when was this? 2011?
---
I mean I think the divide is here: I think there should be risk in committing all of your assets to space intended to be risky in a game intended to have meaningful risk/reward balance. Others wanna play multibox clash of clans in space.
---
They are almost exclusively running cloaky ships now. Risk/loss adverse, but they really enjoy killing your industrial ship. Top class.
---
Aye, it's a delicate balance. I personally think a decent means of solving several issues with the current system would be to simply raise the mineral cost of capitals by a huge amount. I'm no economist, but what I've heard expressed is that a big issue isn't that too many people are mining/ratting, but that capital umbrellas make big alliances untouchable.
---
This increases the value of minerals, thus keeping miners in business. Coupled with the resultant loss of capital umbrellas to protect mining fleets, mining ships (i.e. Rorquals) could be destroyed more often.
---
Balanced right, this could keep mining as a valuable profession, while also lowering what everyone agrees is the main thing preventing Eve from having fun PVP - the proliferation of capitals.
---
that's crazy talk!
---
We could go back to the old way where, if your ships were in a hostile station, they were just trapped there.
---
We can extend that to citadels getting destroyed, where your ships are just gone (because stations couldn't be destroyed back in the day).
---
Right now, zkill only works because all of the major alliances and corps go out of their way to voluntarily report kills.  If you're one party to a fight, and the other wants to take out an ad proclaiming that the fight happened, then blocking that information means interfering with what is (in game) a supposedly very robust and reliable communications network.  And it applies to all of the theoretical baseline humans that are your ship's crew.
---
If you don't want your kills to show up, don't give zkill your esi auth.  If you don't want your victim/killer to tell anyone, that's something else.
---
No it’s not , I’m addressing the people who think they are better for whatever reason then the pve players , I love pvp a lot actually and I think solo pvp takes a lot of skills ! Absolutely!
---
The difference is I don’t think or feel that I am superior then let’s say a miner or a hauler or a ratter.
---
That’s what this post is about .
---
Simply: No
---
For those who saying that's not enough - even leaving aside negative impact of removing "scoreboard" for people who measure their success via zkill, you neglect the fact that flying expensive shit will get less risky. LowSec small scale will just get killed by 5 billion pods 1 billion Lokies.
---
We should keep Intel in order to keep punishing elite pvpers who think that Eve is solo-one-man-army game at least
---
Yeah citadel timer mechanics are just fucking great. 
---
Atleast now we dont have to worry about ppl making sure final timers are not on a weekend in the middle of the day when half of eve is at work. 
---
Cause why the fuck would we want content unless you can cancell your life for a citadel...
---
are you talking about people or an in-game item
---
Because that's like an easier version of dual boxing hulks, which I managed to do quite easily when they weren't obsolete wastes of space like they are now.
---
Sry man i saw your comment about rorquals, made the bait too obvious. Feel free to try someone else tho.
---
First off, you have no place to say "players like you" because you don't know what I think - in part because you are intentionally representing what I'm trying to say.  So you can take your "players like you" and shove it up your wormhole.
---
Secondly, you can make room for your "HTFU" right beside that.  I am not saying there should be no changes.  I am saying that changes are always, in any system, inherently dangerous and should be approached with caution to limit unintended consequences.  Take for instance the recent changes intended to "shake things up" with the big null blocks like Goons - but they aren't hurting us, they are hurting the newer players and smaller alliances.
---
There is no strawman.  You want ganking with minimal risk to the gankers, and all the risk on the ratters.  You're advocating for exactly what you say is wrong, but in the opposite direction.  
---
Sure an unsupported cap can get blapped to oblivion.  But now we'll argue that we should nerf to hell or completely eliminate the ability to support.  
---
Maybe instead of all your bitrtervet reee you should actually think about the effects on the game overall for what you want.
---
Again, do I think things should be shaken up a bit?  Made more dangerous?  Sure.  I said that from the beginning (part of what you choose to ignore and misrepresent).  But unlike you, I would prefer to see it done intelligently, not just to benefit the whiners on /r/eve.
---
My favorite thing is taking tough fitting challenges to the extreme. 
---
Find some new and interesting brawling fleet options in the muninn/eagle/ferox meta, that can fight at least against medium sized fleets. Shake that meta up!
---
Get some funky dread fits together and jump around low/null hunting NPC Sotiyos. They can theoretically be run with a couple dreads and maybe a FAX, but it's very tricky. Fitting properly is crucial. Nice little payout on those as well, and it's the most dangerous PvE content in the game.
---
Just not the catalyst.
---
Sure of course I have a ego just not a superiority complex lol 😝
---
&gt;Zkill blackout was great, basically every character was a threat because you couldn't just go check if he is a pubbie or has a hic with cyno on killboard.
---
Downside is if you kill somebody in a lowsec pipe and want to check that they're not a newbie then you have to wait.
---
Citadel's are perfectly balanced. They give the little guy a fighting chance against a larger group when used and fit well.
---
Good thing that's a destroyer
---
and how many of them were posts with effort?
---
A superiority complex eh...hmm, would that be thinking you’re better than others 🤔
---
&gt; Those groups will start hitting all possible non blue structures for asset drops.
---
we already do that for killmails tbh, and because it's irresponsible to just leave neutral structures lying around near your space in an era where everyone who leaves your group immediately goes full bitter ex and transfers all their shit to your worst enemies
---
&gt;At the same time each of this group will have safe structures that they can defend. This will be just by share number of people they have or by getting enough allies.
---
this is also how it currently is
---
&gt;Sure stuff will die from time time - for example when goons will visit the drone lands a lot of stuff will burn
---
good luck with that
---
&gt;But at the same time we will have a lot of smaller groups that are not blue or important to any of those big players.
---
then they should endeavor to live somewhere out of the immediate sphere of influence of a coalition supercap fleet rather than trying to be cunts and live in someone's backyard so they can "stick it to the man" like most of them currently do
---
&gt; They will not be able to use structures as they will simply die quite fast.
---
this already happens with anything that gets put anywhere that is a problem for a larger coalition
---
&gt; This will lead to many of those smaller groups to die out as members will need to join the big blocks to function "normally".
---
that's literally the current state of eve
---
I saw quill18's videos and decided to give this a try. So I could use a signup link. **If I decide to spend money on this** and the person providing the link gets some advantage from that it would be nice of them to throw a little bit of that my way.

I think only yesterdays activity should show ip in game map.
---
Ah I see you're faimilar with ARCH too
---
In regards to this quote, people also bitch quite heavily when you indeed use titans as a stand off structure basher.  
---
&gt; Lots of people are complaining that a titans combat capabilities are too powerful and should be used as anti station weapons/fleet boosters.
---
While we're at it, make the final timer come out at the same time it was reinforced so you can actually clear structures that nobody is using
---
I could get behind most of these but I have a few questions about others.
---
1) How/why can/should you be able to “hold wormholes open”? 
---
-If you mean remove mass restrictions then they’re no longer wormholes and this removes a huge amount of risk to the game, while allowing the biggest groups to EASILY evict any wormhole Corp they want.
---
2) Being able to cyno caps in Wspace is silly. 
---
-First of all, I THINK that due to the wormhole region system and cap LY jump limitations this would not be possible for the game to begin with.
---
-Second, cynos are the reason people play in Wspace to begin with. Don’t come in here expecting to have your win button.
---
3) Maximum cloak time or fuel usage.
---
-I would support this heavily assuming its balanced properly. It could likely be easily done by having cloaks consume cap/s. It needs to be balanced so that a typical dps ship fit cannot have cloak on forever, but you can gimp your dps fit with batteries and rechargers (If you so choose) to have cloak up longer or indefinitely (beating the cloak consumption cost) with enough of said cap modules.
---
-Further, I think there should be a somewhat unreliable method of detecting cloaked ships. The actual solution for doing this in a fair way is difficult. My best spitball idea is to have another scanner similar to Dscan that can indicate a cloaked ship’s location like sonar, a compass, etc. Think Dscan but for local grid.
---
Jesus it was just an example dude of comparing discrimination on anything .
---
You going to sit here and deny that you where not discriminatory? 
---
Either it be racist or just hate because someone has red car , you where being discriminatory and the question was used as an example not as an suggestion.
---
fake news, r/eve is the pinnacle of useful discussion, you are not agreeing with the majority therefore you are a dirty carebear, go back to the eve forums jajajaja
---
How long have you been waiting for the opportunity to drop that gif? XD
---
Magic Eight ball: None
---
Haha! I actually think I used it at one point when the Invasion first went live. But it is an excellent gif that sums up much of how I feel when I'm designing. :)
---
Yes, absolutely
---
There isn't a hard "why", rather the idea (and this is a joke thread) is just things that would indeed make it harder and more dangerous all around. Straight up removing mechanics making people safe or able to hide.
---
Ok, I'm not totally against the idea of extending inhib range.
---
But how do you balance the mobile inhib vs. the (ummm, drawing a blank at the moment) the structure-based inhib?  Thinking wartime here - you could make a system permanently inhibbed just by flying around a few ceptors with mobile inhibs in them?
---
Delaying NPC kills by 12 does nothing, as the important info from NPC kills is long term activity and timezones of residents in system.
---
&gt; simply raise the mineral cost of capitals by a huge amount. I'm no economist, but what I've heard expressed is that a big issue isn't that too many people are mining/ratting, but that capital umbrellas make big alliances untouchable.
---
a better way to achieve this change would be to nerf the shit out of rorquals and/or delete excavators
---
if you simply increase mineral costs, people will simply rorq mine harder. but if you hobble rorqs, the infinite scaling of rorqs and their mineral production becomes much less of a problem
---
He's a good black hand agent, thanks for the Manhattan project details seddow
---
holy fuck yes
---
first comment on a rare stainguy goodpost
---
 **Do you think tethering mechanics should work on low power citadels?** 
---
No,  but i'll add to it no shield hit points and no reinforce timer
---
I'm in the same boat. I've been playing off and on for about two years, mostly off, so my play time is actually pretty low. I'd love to be able to contribute as DPS in fleets, but many DPS fleet doctrine ships require high skills, which I don't have, so I'm kind of forced to do something with a low skill ceiling, which I don't want to do. I wanna blap ships outta the sky.
---
Victim ? Nah brah I’m addressing the superiority complex that some soloist has , Im not against solo player pvp I think there the best skilled pilots in the game no question in my mind.
---
This info is essential for avoiding shady shit that goes down on faction warfare sites where risk averse nerdboiz will camp novice sites in cloaky instalokis or will sit inside a site with bait ships and a force recon or three. It would help if you brought back gate sliding to help mitigate this.
---
You can drop the snarkyness man.

Having trouble finding the battle report but there you go. 500 FCON. RZR co-FCd with FCON and brought another 100+. No need to be so hostile.
---
You tell me.
---
Of course it is, it came at no cost except time.
---
One good thing that will be hurt by this is the zkill bots. It really is stupid that a bot will post in discord every time a capital is used so people can just send a cyno alt to the system and "check it out". It is more brainless free intel, just like local.
---
I get reported for less in eve, :(
---
your not allowed to say that in public
---
Ccp: lets make a bigger command boost the catch is you also boost the enemy 
---
Ccp smort
---
dont use big words
---
Agreed, low power should only be if it has no fuel
---
Ahh, inferiority complex then, got ya.
---
&gt; The timescale smaller groups could go unnoticed for I promise you is measured in a single digit number of days, not weeks or months.
---
There's also the difference between 1 person noticing, and that info being available to everyone and his cat on dotlan.
---
I suppose grammar is out as well?
---
&gt;  don't you just make low power structures automatically explode.
---
I know this is snark but I would seriously love a degradation factor. If a structure is unpowered for 30 days, it's anchor decays at 10% each month until it's unanchored and waiting for scoop. So just shy of a year and someone yoinks your unwanted orphan structure.
---
yeah and 12 day reinforcement cycles including 3 separate half-hour-minimum periods spent bashing them completely uncontested are super engaging for the attackers, *especially* if the little guy's scrappy little foothold consists of a couple dozen raitarus that are all set to exit final reinforce on the same day in the same hour
---
Online time on inhibitors is too long, once the cyno is up, it’s up. 
---
If you aren’t afk you have plenty of time to pop cyno.
---
http://crossingzebras.com/all-the-foreplay-none-of-the-action-uq9-3c/
---
400 there. The remaining 100 couldn't fit and were waiting off grid. Everything seems to align with my version of the events. Is that enough proof for you?
---
well the mobile inhibs can be shot up pretty quickly. I'm pretty sure the mobile inhibs burn out after a bit too, dont they? I'd probably drop their timer down to maybe 15-30 minutes, so you can't just permajam an entire system. Maybe even make them appear on overview. There's no such thing as a quiet jammer, after all.
---
The problem is CCP blowing smoke up my ass acting like these are for the best meanwhile there just trying to boast the profits for Daddy Pearl Abyss.
---
As someone who’s on day 5 or so playing this game, I appreciate your tip. I’ll remember it for when I get to that point.
---
CHAOS ERA
---
Your corp taxes bountys
---
Sounds like you want it easier for you at the expense of other people’s time.  You want to be fed that free intel easy hulk kill and take 10 hours from that person, but flying “40 jumps” (you base in jita....really?) is a deal breaker for you.  Carry on Mr. President!
---
Ok so... dscan spikes with jump-capable ships.  I report it, in jumps my rescue fleet.  Your fleet is warping to me, my fleet warps to me.  delays the "rescue" by what, maybe 30 seconds to a minute?  And if I'm not using dscan, then what, maybe 2 minutes?  If My rorq can't tank for 2 minutes (even forgetting panic) then I deserve to lose it.  What has been achieved?
---
its mostly only the Erebus and Leviathan generators that gets used in big capital fights. Avatar generator are sometimes pulsed once to help a cap fleet regen capacitor before jumping, but usually not often while in combat
---
Huh, I like it. Thing is, though, nobody thinks there are 'too many subcapitals'. Nerfing Rorqs overall would spike mineral prices overall and negatively affect subcap production too. Meanwhile, increasing the cost of capitals will result in a lot more Rorquals being killed as more are deployed simultaneously - while leaving the cost of making subcaps pretty much untouched.
---
Another option could be nerfing the Rorq's stats to make them a bit easier to kill, thus dissuading anyone but those who desperately need capitals (i.e. big alliances in arms races) from using them. Perhaps the Orca could be buffed slightly to compensate, allowing smaller operations to mine the materials needed to make subcaps.
---
How can I put this...
---
With local in nullsec, groups can spot you roaming into their space on their intel network early.  Krabs can assess the threat, they can see you come into local, and they can decide if they need to safe up or not.
---
But without local, those same krabs are constantly at risk, and in order to facilitate some ability for actual profitability in the long run, their alliance will have to take measures to protect them.  So they'll not just turtle up, but also likely camp the fuck out of the area(s) leading to their space (some groups have already started doing this btw).
---
So while yes, you won't have to waste time looking for where people are, your options to actually get fights in those areas rather than simply dying to a nasty gatecamp will be pretty slim.
---
Funny how all your arguments can be applies to wormholes but wormholes don't have NPC kill stats available. Seems like you want to crab in peace and be able to hide your activity while wanting other crabs to feed you free kills.
---
Geminate now the renter space
---
So is no one going to call him out for basing up in Jita for pvp content?  Fine I will.
---
Honestly my corp kinda relies on our single structure being tough so we can accomplish logistics, staging, and have a safe haven in the hellscape that is J-space.
---
Jumping removes temporary buffs
---
its all black(out)
---
They should barely listen at all. They should develop what they want to develop. Gathering data on their own and analyze it.
---
They release something and then analyze the effects, more players playing and doing stuff means it was good.
---
Yea, I'd like this.
---
thanks for your input, line bean
---
I don't believe in /s, but I think my intent was lost on you
---
Why?
---
I'd change asset safety. Each item in your hangar gets a percentage chance to drop into the loot pile (where it has the standard chance to drop as loot or be destroyed). Anything that survives this test is asset safetied to LS or your standby structure but you no longer have a 15% fee. Oh, and there's no moving your stuff voluntarily, either.
---
Pre-Rorq mining I was in a smaller group in null.  When we had a corp mining op, we would bubble the gate(s) as needed and have scouts 1 system out in all needed directions.  
---
Why is this suddenly so hard?
---
good sir are you *trolling*?
---
scandalous
---
Imma say again it your solo pvp does minimal to the eco system of eve !
---
Who the real bottom feeders now huh ?
---
Eve is a community based game , you wouldn’t have a ship if it wasn’t for pve players.
---
You may be interested in what ares balancing and retro-action loops.
---
How to kill Myrm: Overwhelming DPS in scram range (every myrm i've killed so far had an mjd). Most navy cruisers and above can plausibly tank and take down a myrm. Hecates also work with minor risk.
---
How to kill a dominix: Solo bombers can do it with care. Well tanked T3Cs can also do fine. Generally you need more than one pilot to do this well and cheaply if they're not AFK, because dominixes have many defensive tools on the menu
---
I don’t even think it should work for docking etc.  Asset safety everything and start decaying into space rubble.
---
i don't think rorqs are too hard to kill. they die relatively easily to a fleet configured properly to do the thing to them
---
the problem is that there are too many of them generating too much ore to create too many supercapital ships in eve and it's just not possible to kill enough of them to make an impact
---
so if we're petitioning ccp to do shit for us, the thing i'd ask for is that excavators go away. picture an eve online where a colossal anomaly has 1-2 boosting rorqs mining with mining drone 2s and 50-75 barges in it
---
doesn't that sound better
---
When did people's killboards becomes a more important barometer of their success in EVE then their enjoyment of the game?
---
New eden is supposed to be a dystopian hellscape infested with crazy capsuleers.
---
Eve online is supposed to be a video game **that is actually fun to play**.
---
It feels like half of both CCP and the player base cannot make this distinction.

Oh, I'd thought they were pretty tough.
---
Well, you've changed my mind, stranger. That sounds a heck of a lot better.
---
Oh, when did that change come in finally? Good to know they got round to fixing it.
---
The cost of the citadel shouldn't be a justification for making it work like a dickstar with a POS shield. If your dickstar lost fuel, it lost it's dickstarness.
---
If they wanted to cater to pearl abyss' wants they would be appealing to the pvers not the pvpers. As the pve players are more consistent and more easily monetised.
---
Completely removing asset safety will only lead to even more people joining safer coalitions. What incentive is for medium sized alliances to put down roots if someone can roll through with a massive super fleet and get some juicy killmails. 
---
If you're going to go this route there needs to be more NPC space.

A ton of people let them go fallow. I have three in that state now that weren't worth the fuel to keep them online. Others end up this way because the owner had RL problems and hasn't been in the game for a while.

There're probably a thousand or more (number from my ass) in highsec that are abandoned.

Can you say more about what you mean by “mooring”? I know that term has been used before with regard to citadels, just wondering how it’s distinct from tethering (if at all)?

Separately, totally on board with more risk across the board mechanic wise.

&gt;you wouldn’t have a ship if it wasn’t for pve players.

I would. Ccp givea out gnosises and praxis and others from time to time.

Ah no I'm saying that's as it was, not is currently. Aoplogies
---
I mean it’s sorta bad game design when more tools exist out of game to help you play the game?
---
Honestly I make this same face if the players are killing the trigs too
---
citadel spinning is the new ship spinning.
---
I also like the idea of someone flipping a Keepstar upside down, it would lead to all ships undocking doing a 180° roll though, since flying upsde down isn't something you can actually do in EVE
---
you got any more of that cap stability?

I'm guessing... not giant-alliance-bloc-aligned? Member of a public (NPC) corp? Actually no idea.

---
I would *LOVE* for there to be more stuff hacking modules/cov ops frigs could do to tie into this idea.
---
&gt;while allowing the biggest groups to EASILY evict any wormhole Corp they want.
---
This can only serve to make WH more dangerous which balances their risk to reward ratio obviously  
---
&gt; \-First of all, I THINK that due to the wormhole region system and cap LY jump limitations this would not be possible for the game to begin with. -Second, cynos are the reason people play in Wspace to begin with. Don’t come in here expecting to have your win button. 
---
refer to my previous point  
---
Basically if we can destroy the ecosystem of nullsec by balancing it for wormholers to get easy ganks then its only right and fair that we break wormholes so nullsec can get easy evictions on wormholers
---
generally they only need to run 1 repper while ratting, and then you carry a cap booster. if you get engaged you use the cap booster and triple rep your way to victory!

True, the Proteus pretty much sucks at everything.

Everyone doesn't go to the big guys because the big guys will drop a ton of caps to defend. My group have almost exclusively gone northwest since there's less chance of getting dropped there.
---
Uhm I been playing for 10 years man , with 3 accounts,
---
And I pay sub because I support the game , occasionally buy some plexes for a skin or two , 
---
These changes are not beneficial to the smaller communities of eve at all , it actually hurt them the most , the mega alliances has the means to resist , 
---
You want to talk about how CCP greed fucked up the game , start with all those skill injectors shit they did to cater to the fortnite community and it trew everything else out of balance , 
---
Now you want to fix  it with these bullshit changes saying it’s for the old school vet community?
---
Your full shit bro just like the Pearl Abyss puppets that CCP is on that state of chaos interview !
---
Bah supposedly to cater to the smaller community my ass , 
---
There trying to fix there fuck up with these skill injectors and trying to cover up with bullshit smoke just like you are right now.
---
Explosive more.
---
That FW targets can dock into stations that have LP stores belonging to the other faction, effectively making it where they can newbhunt frigates in T3C without repercussions.
---
That going into a FW plex doesn't cause suspect timer.
---
That the Venture has built in warp stabs instead of a 2nd low.
---
I swear I managed to backflip a hurricane while ramming a myrm once
---
I'm always amazed when they jump in a carrier or one lone fax against a horde of bombers. Everyone in the bomber fleet ooo free kill lol. Than again please do continue to do so you never know maybe your carrier will be the chosen one.
---
Sure, htts://www.Google.com you'll even get videos explaining it. Not sure if any will have sock puppets though.
---
yes but they are still weak to kinetic . Most serpentis are weaker to thermal than kinetic, yet you say kinetic is "ideal for shooting serpentis" .
---
Low powered stuff should be like a Pos without fuel no reinforce timers no usability if you don't want to fuel your stuff your don't deserve it and of course no asset safety.
---
&gt; 1) How/why can/should you be able to “hold wormholes open”?
---
Giving a way to raid/attack home holes with forces large enough to offset the home-hole cap cache adds content. A "wormhole stabilizer" module to hold a hole open adds risk by reducing the ability to control entry by critting holes. Could even make it such that holes that have just been collapsed leave a signature which can be reopened with stabilizers, that way you can chase a fleeing fleet.
---
\^ This.  One of the things that makes me play EvE is gathering lots of kills so I can drool over my, nice, green killboard. It will severely impact my incentive to play the game if it is removed. I don't get a chance to loot my kills 99% of the time so my killboard on zkill is my "reward", why would I even PVP if I don't get loot and also don't have a nice killboard on zkillboard to show for.
---
Well, the stupid thing is that the problem often is not to find the right answer, but to formulate the question properly, and by the little that you said and that I understood, I found that and like a kid who discovers a paddling pool, I'm in the same state for this video, thank you.

does it means that the trash compactor actually gets the skill points?

Can you for a probe launcher on that? My guess is OP wants a ceptor so they can quickly scan a lot of systems.
---
Yup kinda like a narcissist.
---
No, it's not a particularly unpopular opinion. There is plenty of support both for and against the asset safety mechanic, with good arguments on both sides.
---
The problem is that citadels replaced both POSes as well as outposts. The former could be destroyed (with loot spew), while the latter were indestructible. The citadel structures that replaced them are all destructible, removing the availability of a safe place to store goods in sov-null. In order to have a smooth transition, without impacting players who were inactive, asset safety was introduced as an intermediate solution between the full risk of losing assets in a POS and the indestructible outposts.
---
:)
---
Yes he voices his opinion which is great but its shame that he doesn't listen with the same intimacy.
---
How about delayed log-in Himmler. Log-in screen opens up and players don't log in until Himmler decides he's done doing daily autistic/downs episodes.
---
Yeah, wonder if players are still there? Do they want to play anymore? Who knows... fog of war.
---
Honestly I don’t know what was on their minds when they designed this thing. I think the best way to buff the phenomena generator is to treat it like a wormhole buff allowing certain doctrines to work better against others. You can’t actuvate a phenomena generator if another one is active nearby. This could turn most fights focal points over who has control over the phenomena generator environment

Second Commentary Video since the last was well received. I hope to have more for y'all soon.

A few mistakes in the video:

During the fitting discussion I misspoke and the correct coefficient is 0.4 not .04. 
---
I am unable to pronounce the word 'corpmates'
---
Enjoy!
---
And the trolling of doing this to make the titans logged off on it get stuck inside... while you removed their docking right when they logged off.
---
Cynos should also be visible by anybody, not just people with jump drives.  A distance limit (5LY? Base range of a JF) should be imposed, but you should be able to see a local cyno fire off.
---
i think they should change it so that it only boosts fleet/corp/alliance and to make titan flagship instead of main combat ship nerf the turret dmg and increasse the command boost bonus
---
Actually, true....I think we should just leave it as it is, this is giving me a headache lol.

---
Not a Wormholer, Bob forgive me - how would this affwct their hole mapping?

All that other shit aside, at the very least give the advantage to the attacker when it comes to the timer. If you want to defend your dumbass structure, YOU should be the one forming to defend it.
---
Life is all about choices. 
---
Train for a Tengu and shoot bonused kinetics into a stronger Angel resist, or train for a Legion and have better natural tank resists but shoot unbonused damage missiles into a higher resist?
---
Same thing with Serpentis rats. Do you want to shoot a Kinetic bonused missile into their second lowest resist, and have naturally higher resists to their damage type? Or do you want to shoot into their lowest resist but with an unbonused damage missile? Depends on your skills.
---
No you're right. I'm just so frustrated because people have made really sensible list of things to improve FW and nothing, nothing changed. Nullsec is a bit more free for all.
---
I didn't do much nullsec, the few fleet flights were extremely boring. The best experiences I had were quick and spontaneous group of galmil to catch some bigger ships going through the sectors, that was some fun.

Pretty much kill med and small sized alliance deployments.

It'll be a major buff to big entities, harassing their sov will become very very expensive.

I wouldn't say delete the stats - I'd restrict stats to the region your character is located.  If you want stats from across the map, fly an alt there and get it or find a WH and go there.  No more freebie information from Tenal when my character is in Paragon Soul.
---
I didn't think any of you were allowed out in public.
---
It looks to me like you like blabbering a lot.
---
My point was not about "the meaning of life" of this kind of shit.
---
My point was that if you accept to shoot in secondary weakness on serpentis, then you should also accept to shoot on secondary weakness on angels.
---
Meaning that tengu is just as good versus angels than versus serpentis.
---
So you claiming it's good vs serp but not good vs angels is contradictory.
---
Privateer was a game made in 1993, by the same guy who's making Star Citizen. The veldor is his design.
---
Oh look this topic is new and fresh
---
afterburning hound w/ shield booster and bomb launcher
---
its not easy, but its doable. probably the "cheapest" way to potentially solo one
---
a lot of ratting domis aren't particularly well tanked... they tank just enough to survive the rats... so a bomber pushes them right over the edge and they kind of melt
---
you just need to do all your work before they can target you and get their drones to putt over....
---
position yourself in a way where the drones have the longest distance to travel.... and hope...
---
You have to make allowances for large groups that are bored and looking for content.
---
Unless it's changed, anyone can see lot cynos
---
Like I said, choices.
---
Angular?
---
You do get that the chain to high sec is changed daily right ? 
---
So if you don't live in a HS static your gonna be 2/3 holes away from a high sec, like once a freighter is on a HS hole it's kinda safe, as it's boosh immune ( DST not so much ). 
---
But you more likely then not are doing your logistic past citadels you don't control or are waiting for a wandering hole. ( that only applies to c3 and c5 groups ), for C4 and C2 groups well you have no wandering HSes so your logistics is nearly always gonna be multiple jumps likely with hostiles staged somewhere.
---
I'm tired of hearing excuses from CCP that they had no idea that certain major problems with game play balance were happening and that it wasn't until better data collecting ability was introduced with Into the Abyss that they became fully aware of their errors. This despite year after year of specific and detailed accounting of problems by players being countered by CCP Devs saying "we don't see that". Will be interesting to see what new faulty or misspun interpretation they will come up next. Resource Wars 2 perhaps?
---
You didnt lose stuff before, you get that right? You flipped the station and you perhaps lost control but you lost nothing. Asset safety was implemented with that in mind.
---
Besides, do you seriously not see the issue with removing this? You cant see how a group that can field 1000 titans would just destroy everything else and entire alliances/coalitions would die out. If you want serenity, this is def the way to go.
---
Omg I know....had to fly 3 regions away to find things to kill. Thankfully brave newbies will gift wrap you a machriel and a kiki
---
I feel like 10-20 caps killing 12 bombers is not an awful thing.
---
But don’t think you have the right to bash pve players
---
ya maybe i sounded a bit offensive on this one ... was not intended ...also i let null sec dudes do their nullsec stuff ... i mean this is one of the best parts of this game that there are so many different ways to play it and it is all in one game.... would be very sad if i dont come across hundreds of players when getting my alt to jita or finding nothing when i decide to go hunt in null ... i think most ppl forget about this when they tell others how to play the game the "right" way. o7
---
Miner calm down.
---
Imagine, instead of making a more prominint fog of war, you adjusted the things null player would fighter over so it is fucking terrible to do.  
---
Fozzie sov still sucks  
---
Citadels still suck  
---
but at least we can attack krabs easier
---
A low power citadel should be a big loot p[iñata](https://www.google.com/search?q=pinata&amp;rlz=1C1CHBD_enUS852US852&amp;source=univ&amp;tbm=shop&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHlt3g8dzjAhUIU98KHW9qAgMQsxgILg).  No damage cap, no timer, no ability to defend itself and no asset safety.  One shot it with Titans or kill it in one visit with subcaps no difference.
---
I was heretofore unaware of this information.
---
Thank you.
---
*For you*
---
You are not every gamer out there. Not everyone thinks the same way. Some people like PvP. Some people like PvE. Some Like Creative, some like Survival. Some like a record of what they've done. 
---
You know there are people who are completionists, right? Who do the work just for the trophy?
---
(See the feathers in assassin's creed 2 for details. Yes, you got a reward out of it. It wasn't a good one.)
---
There's no way to leave your ship facing "up" or "down." Your ship always "rights itself" to the solar plane.
---
Sure.  But a couple of ceptors with cargo holds full of moble inhibs, warping around to various deep safes and dropping them as needed....even if you do blow one up or it expires, you can still keep a system jammed...
---
Thanks for the info, didn’t know caps could use MJU’s.
---
It always bothered me that there's no way to leave your ship facing "up" or "down." Your ship always "rights itself" to the solar plane. Same thing goes here. I'd love to see more "sideways" or even "upside down" stations as a reminder that there is no true up and down in space.
---
This needs to be mutable. K Thx
---
Asset safety isn't a benefit it's just parity with stations.
---
Yea, I was saying you can click the pin (I think?) to unpin or pin it. Maybe it's "pinned" when you go to remove it?
---
Most of them left b/c CCP hates smallgang, it doesn't bring in revenue. Smallballers need to learn how to sub alts, get them in fleet and blob.
---
Good point, the different elements "burning" would create different reactions.
---
Like the idea, just to make things even prettier.
---
Viva la Revolution!
---
Wholesome.

when i gated my [totally not bait] Neureus somewhere i passed trough a Trig system, gate i landed on was full of wrecks, and noone around, so i went and approached on of em

Not an afk ratting ship, but will preform decent and can withstand a decent barrage.
---
Its not about applying NEW ISK-Sinks ... or are trading fees and taxes on NPC-Stations a new concept? Its about removing stuff that was implemented obviously without thinking about the effects (trading citadels).
---
Well without getting some shit  talk back lol 
---
I like dreddit it’s pretty therapeutic, get to talk shit to the shit talkers.
---
Oh no, 2 to 3 jumps, must be sooo hard moving stuff out of wormholes... /s
---
I believe that a bomber can do it, but it feels like engaging at scram range is suicidal. I wonder if it's viable to fit scram + point, leading with point and only moving in to scram if you see MJD activate?
---
I'd 100% be ok with CCP forcing us back to poses, citadels are still some broken shit compared to living out of towers
---
If you wanna go that route and believe in capitalism and nuclear power, how many places in the world were poisoned by DU rounds fired  and how many children have to grow up with the prospect of early cancer ?
---
I thought that's what the floating debris was you find around gates.....
---
They have to agress you before your missile launcher knows that they are foes. This has to happen once per system.
---
I need Nhaz'agul habibi to translate this
---
because any percentage of loss means you have to store it in npc stations ( which imo is an antithesis of actually living in an area.) for fear that the most valueable gets dropped if you afk in a game.  It is far better to pay the tax whether at current price or raising it ( which i am in favor of.)
---
Killmails also tell a personal story. I often find myself 5-6 years deep in my killboard, and KMs are great at bringing back memories of forgotten but awesome fights, hilariously stupid moments, or illustrating my own personal progression from clueless noob in 2009 to today.
---
Dude, you could just sell your stuff on contracts. Or join the ones living there. You never lost anything outside of physical access. You are creating a mechanic/game that never existed outside of your head.
---
Asset safety was implemented with that in mind. Some would argue its even slightly worse than before. Removing it means a clusterfuck of epic proportions.
---
does the target off agression have to be same ship as used to rat?
---
I see room for CCP to introduce new structures. You want local, you put up structure(s) that monitor gate activity and identifies pilot entering the system. This way, the user of the system is responsible for upkeep costs and this would leave all other systems still blacked out (or information delayed). You have 3 gates in your system, that would mean putting up 3 structures that monitor gate activity. Now it would be fun if only the alliance owning the system(s) would be able to see local.
---
Now THIS would get me back.
---
&gt; A properly fit fort does the damage of 3-4 dreads. Has the neuting power to turn off any cap in a few minutes.   
---
&gt; It has bombs in low sec it has burst projectors. It has op ewar 
---
Do you know how much damage and EWAR a properly fit POS had?
---
&gt; All this must be endured for 30 minutes ontop of an enemy fleet. 
---
That's the plan
---
&gt; My solution would be to shoot the ewar and turret hard points on the citadel to disable them. 
---
Only if we get to add/anchor spares.
---
&gt; Also the timers are way too long. I think there should either be 1 timer or 2 timers 24 hours apart + - the swing. Otherwise all of eve shows up to your fort timers. Which is bad for sig/local content 
---
It's rare for the defender/agressor to show up for the second timer. All of EVE showed up for Keepstars when they were rare.
---
&gt; What could be a good fight between two equal sized entities is ruined by the oppressive nature of citadels. And doing it 3 times over a week is demoralizing af. 
---
I know this is a crazy idea, but maybe don't fight at the structure?
---
you shut your whore taxing mouth
---
Use faction missiles, they have a way better range and application
---
I'm not sure I'd say "I want to store literally all my shit in nullsec with no risk. Store my big stockpiles in nearby NPC stations and just keep the essentials in stations that can be blown up? Nah bruh fuck that" is either reasonable or logical
---
You do understand this is a game right? And if you make it too hardcore people will just stop playing it right? I mean, this does compute for you in some way doesnt it?
---
There should he zero intel unless you are in space gathering it. No esi endpoints, no in game map data and delay zkill by a minimum of 24 hours.
---
Rather, just remove citadels. We don’t need those anyways. They cause us to lose sleep to stay up and bash them.
---
Well, if the hostile fleet has been on grid with you for two minutes before your friends even arrive in system, and then when they do arrive they're warping in from off-grid in a known direction, there could be an awful lot of bubbles waiting to pull them out of warp an inconvenient distance away rather than having them jump in right on top of the action.
---
If I'm AFK and the keepstar with my assets is destroyed or unanchored.  Will my assets automatically go into assest safety or is better to do that to them before going afk?
---
Remove sec loss for ship-to-ship combat in low sec (keep it in high and keep it for agression on capsules) - it's a dumb tax on people undocking and fighting.
---
The praxis is a battleship. The gnosis a battlectuiser. They have uses for solo pvp.
---
wish we had a group of players with knowledge who would give input. wait...
---
You mean when you game its not like
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12vh55_1ul8
---
?
---
Nah go one step further: Anyone can jump to any cyno.
---
The whole point of (the bulk of the) trade taxes is to push people into trade fort/keeps to bring taxes back to what they were pre-citadel. Taxes were actually buffed right after the market module was introduced to keep the isk sink the same
---
1.Escalating citadel upkeep costs based on number in system. EVERY citadel in system impacted. Includes price of clones (minimum), fuel block consumption etc.
---
while i like the idea it would hurt smaller groups,  large group deploys to your system you are now out priced on cloning or you can't deploy due to costs.    
---
2. Cap the number of buy and sell orders in a market based on the size of the station. 5k for an small up to 100k for largest. Somewhere in between for npc stations.  
---
at first i did think this was a good idea but  after reviewing it all you're doing is making it harder for new industral player getting there foot in the door.
---
3. Lock buy or sell orders from being modified more than once every 1-6 hours.  
---
No we are all human (or should be) and we make mistakes at current modify order rate you can still be punished for it 
---
4. Story line that allows mechanic to assault low and high sec and turn them into null sec.  
---
no i could see us turning high secs around the new player areas into null sec we have those types of players 
---
5. Remove all forms of in and out of game intel or reduce them to 24 hour refresh.  
---
Agreed tio removal not the 24 hour timer  
---
7. Introduce resource scarcity/resource regeneration mechanic capping the amount of players a region can support to around 1000-2000 at most. Including high security space.
---
I would do it based of number of system in a region   
---
8. Introduce mechanic to hold a wormhole open for an invasion force.
---
something that could be easy to kill i.e cyno inhub idea could be cool  
---
9. Change structure timers to at most 5 days from start to finish for any structure. Change armor timer to 8 hour vulnerability and hull to 4 hour vulnerability.
---
36-72h max remove armour reinforce timers, shields -&gt; reinfore -&gt; dead  
---
10. Drop asset safety to 50 % and the rest drops as loot. Let RNG decide who gets what.
---
due to the changes to citadels i want no as this gives allows people to go on holiday
---
11. Remove tether. Just give citadels normal structure mechanics.  
---
with the removal of poses just no.  
---
12. Change Concord reaction time to include a random +/- 0 % to 1000 % reaction speed. Maybe the gank will go really well, maybe the fuzz will shut you down.
---
No lets make ganking harder so let make concord react faster, but cut the ewar they do also add in the chance to escape   
---
13. Your war HQ gets destroyed? All wars end immediately and your corporation and the alliance you are a part of is on mandatory cease fire for 30 days. You better show up to fight.  
---
I'd go with 7-10 days  
---
14. Change cynos to have a chance for a random exit vector. 1 % to land somewhere random in system. 1-10 % chance to land within 100-1000km of target. Skills to reduce drift down to 10-100km of target. Get rekt jump freighters.
---
so a skill that means i couldn't warp to the station i want to jump too sounds like a skill i wouldn't train, jump freighters get rekted all the time.  
---
15. Change covery cynos to have double the percentage of going wrong and spooky space dunking you.  
---
No once again corevt cynos allow for some of the best game play.
---
13. Add cynos to wormholes, jumping through any neighboring system linked via a current open wormhole. Mass limitations apply.
---
why turn wh into null.  
---
14. Add permanent damage to the hull when you burn a module out to 100 %. Module hp was 40 and you burned it out? -40hp on your hull permanently.
---
No better yet add minerals needed for repairs to any damage all remote and local repair module to need nanopaste  
---
15. Corpse collector mechanic! If you have the corpse of the person you are shooting, gain +10 % damage! Have to consume the corpse as a drug.  
---
thats just odd 
---
16. Minimum buy/sell order price change is 1 % of your original posted price. No more 0.01isk.
---
once again as above would hurt the newer player more than the older vet  
---
17. Maximum cloak time / fuel usage mechanic introduced. Removal permanent safety feature.  
---
standard cloaks should get better time/fuel than covert cloak you can warp that is your safety net
---
That's insanity! I like it
---
Dumb question but why do you consider killmails necessary?
---
So you wanna remove the turret dmg which is pretty much 1-2 dreads worth of dmg on something that costs about 30-40 times as much?
---
I thought this too, but my saber alt sat pointed down after i cloaked it on a wormhole the other day. I was surprised.
---
Haha yeah even I got confused rereading my answer, I hope you figure out whatever is confusing you o/
---
Wow, look at that, it seems like CCP did give us anti-cap subcap ships. Good comp and great tactics, they took a good pound of flesh and moonwalked out.
---
Where writing risk assessments here, so the risk of warping 2/3 jumps truth space that is effectively hostile risking a drag bubble timing from a cloaked sabre etc, seems a lot more risky even if done right then jumping between citadels. 
---
Options to catch a jump freighter all include the jump freighter pilot fucking up to some degree, where as DST hauling it can be as simple as you press jump 4 loki's and sabre decloak and your fucked ( there is literally nothing you can do against it ).
---
Yes they do ! Or even smartbombing on the praxis but I think your missing the point here.
---
No worries bro, fly dangerous
---
Good - let them organize. Same for defenders. Such intel is often faulty and incomplete as wel.
---
&gt; Surely there needs to be some benefit to upwells
---
Personal hangars.
---
And you've set up a POS before right? What a pain...
---
zkill gets all business and nobody will use yours tbh, not sure if anyone told you this yet. EVE is the worst game to develop for - run for the hills. They're considering delaying all api (now esi) information/datapoints by minute or hours to have a fog of war. Publish for a more popular, less eratic game. Eve's development and ill ceo will leave you penniless.
---
Sounds fine to me
---
Only have in nullsec what u are prepared to lose, if you want complete safety in a station go hisec or lowsec your argument is invalid.
---
yes while increassing command boost bonus remember how theyr suposed to be flagships
---
Right now there's a 15% fee. I would give assets a 15% chance of going into the loot pile and dropping or be destroyed with current loot mechanics. No more 15% ransom.
---
Some of the changes that make up CCPs reputation of fixing an OP with a "now its utter trash"
---
It does that if you’re set to approach something
---
There is also the minor issue that this style is currently winning and most groups are in the process if not directly adopting it so delve is becoming what the rest of new eden want to be.
---
A slasher with 3 points works great.
---
Welcome
---
Np, honestly most people don't know that, which is why I think they're used so rarely...
---
The project 2-3 years ago that was public knowledge? Oof
---
I would boost the bonus to  phenomena generator but it only boosts your fleet
---
stop them from fitting HAW dreads only   
---
allow them to fit 2 Doomsday 1 - race 1 non race and change the refire rate so it takes longer to fire the non race DD
---
I had it orbiting the wh. Just stopped it after cloaking and it stayed verticle.
---
No source what so ever. People are assuming based on what was said during the talkinginstations interview yet I got the complete opposite impression. Nothing definitive has been said, period.
---
&gt;position yourself in a way where the drones have the longest distance to travel.... and hope...
---
I rat in my domi with sentry drones. 
---
All you need to do in solo bomber is scram and drain power and maybe fire some torps. But in general if the ratter started a fresh cycle of rats, it is the rats that do most of the damage. 
---
This is how I got caught several times.
---
This could probably be quoted as your most accurate assessment ever, and hold true for almost every person on r/eve to some degree or another.
---
&gt; actually knew what they wanted, just that they complain loudly on reddit and hold strong opinions
---
I use an astero and a stratios. Uncloak strat and long point it, use the tactical overlay on my astero to see where the myrm/domi is aligned, burn the astero 100km off and catch him when he panic MJDs. 80% success rate so far, pretty fun high apm play style too :)
---
Any considerations for a nice new challenge? PvP Related, Indy related, Interactions with people?
---
I mean selling your friends out for a Plex sub is pretty low in my book lmbo
---
JFs also use fuel as a cost (not to mention the cits do as well.) and have to jump to npc stations.  As well not everyone has access to a jump capable ship.  JFs also dont have a fucking cloak.  If you want jfs to be more vulnerable, I agree to that and would say that if they get tethered instantly that should stop.  I disagree its more risk for wormholers (they also often scout the wormholes before jumping a dst through them negating that anyway.)
---
wth? I don't agree with this at all... local chat blackout had the greatest impact of all, and by far, over the last couple weeks on my game play.
---
I don't know if this was sarcasm or not... but I actually agree with the sentiment. Harden up and take your chances/fit to burn back to gate or go with friends/a scout.
---
&gt; because any percentage of loss means you have to store it in npc stations
---
Wait, Please read your comment again. You move to null expecting zero chance of loss? That right there is your big problem. If you want 100% safety, move to NPC null or to empire space and live out of an indestructible station.
---
15% is something you already lose in liquid assets when you get your stuff back. The only difference is someone else might benefit from your asset. 
---
&gt;for fear that the most valueable gets dropped if you afk in a game
---
Or maybe the 15% gods are in your favor and you only lose 5% of actual value. Don't be so full of fear. You're only losing imaginary items for one thing and you have a pretty low chance of losing any particular item for another.
---
In other words, HTFU.
---
Again, i didnt say that pve should be removed just that whiny pve players dont get to influence game decisions.
---
Yeah take a look at them and then remove them . Game was better without
---
... lol
---
Faction scrams do 3 points.
---
If my fleet is “warping to you” then I’ve already fucked up and we are just gonna have a big fight.
---
Ideally it goes more along the lines of...we tackle and bubble you, defensive bubbles go up along star warpin. Now when your caps jump they have to align and warp, and if we defended the grid properly your caps take multiple minutes to arrive. Or, you have to fight our bubblers with subcaps to free up your caps.
---
https://www.google.com/search?q=heavy%20warp%20disruptor%20eve
---
Faulty logic, bud.
---
Still not sure why you don't post your good ideas on an alt account.
---
Well the game changed from api to esi, that fucked every eve-oriented developer/website since you need to change all your points if I understand correctly the outrage when that happened. Is that when you left? Eve didn't get better since then tbh but you will need to rewrite everything you had I think.
---
&gt;Do you know how much damage and EWAR a properly fit POS had?
---
You can shoot a POSes defences idiot noob 
---
&gt;That's the plan
---
Yes the plan and you have a lot in common. YOU’RE BOTH RETARDED IF IT ISNT CLEAR
---
&gt;Only if we get to add/anchor spares.
---
Something that can be destroyed, can be repaired. 
---
&gt;It's rare for the defender/agressor to show up for the second timer. All of EVE showed up for Keepstars when they were rare.
---
Do you play eve?
---
&gt;I know this is a crazy idea, but maybe don't fight at the structure?
---
Brings me back to my retarded comment earlier. Structures are the incentive to fight. Your idea isn’t crazy, it’s fucking stupid.
---
God bless
---
But seriously, don’t think you have the right to bash pve players
---
Man seeing dead terrorists around brings me back...
---
Is it just me or does it seem like a lot more  content videos are surfacing since black out?
---
I know personally my guys have been getting so much better escalations since the black out. Like tackled rorqs turning into multiple caps on field instead of blue balls or a helldunk.
---
The thing none of you living in nullsec understand is that 99% of wormhole corps do not have the pilots or the caps to field more then 3-5 capitals at a time. The 1% can field maybe 10-20 in absolute dire eviction straits. 
---
If you were able to hold wormholes open and jump your 40 Nyx fleet into wormholes, wormhole pvp would altogether disappear. It would turn into nullsec members independently owning farm holes because all of the pvp would die.
---
 Do you know why they called it the Xbox 360?
---
Because when you walk up to it, you turn 360 degrees and walk away.
---
Random EVE dude: I like accumulating wealth, it's fun!  
---
ELITE PVPer: That's a stupid metric to judge success and happiness by... you are stupid.  
---
CCP: Hey, let's delay zkill.  
---
ELITE PVPer: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE - but my metrics I judge my success and happiness by!
---
I'm guessing the exit into Everyshore was the easiest access to Jita or Dodixie? Saw a few dozen of the afk pods come through.
---
Aeon with a full mid-rack of them.
---
Keep at range works. But requires a target. You can't just do it in the middle of space.
---
It is. I only hear it when i have to reset my audio.
---
So now someone using Google in the future will find op's thread and your less than helpful message... Sending them on an infinite loop of torture, despair and death!!!
---
i wouldn't recommend getting into scram range on a domi
---
but a myrm.... probably worth it in most ships :)
---
Im wondering how long it will take for the elites to lose their shit and the reee posts to commence. Think its really itching right now, just need something to tip them over.
---
I would argue that a vivid imagination is a good thing, but what do I know.
---
They give bonuses and debuffs. If you were in an armor fleet and used a bus phenom you’d screw over an enemy shield fleet while giving yourself extra hours
---
&gt;Wait, Please read your comment again. You move to null expecting zero chance of loss? That right there is your big problem. If you want 100% safety, move to NPC null or to empire space and live out of an indestructible station.
---
yeah, not what I said, nice conflating though.  I expect loss out in space, not being afk.  It is NOT 100% safety to have asset safety, that is a misnomer.  Just because someone does not want to lose their shit while afk playing a game does not mean they should not be in Null Sec, and in fact will make Null sec even less populated which I doubt anyone in their right mind wants.
---
&gt;15% is something you already lose in liquid assets when you get your stuff back. The only difference is someone else might benefit from your asset.
---
Yes out of isk which is an acceptable loss and tax to pay imo, rather than RNG bullshit killing rare or valueable items while you are away from the game.
---
&gt; In other words, HTFU. 
---
"But I want my loot drops"  How about you HTFU instead of wanting loot handed to you on a plate?  Sounds like you are the actual carebear here...
---
Gathering intel is more than just about looking at the KB and see what's going in a 24 hour time period. It's understanding what's going on over the course of a few weeks or months and understanding trends. When we look at KBs, we're going back several weeks or months. Not just for the last day.  I'm for all API delays but there seems to be this narrative in recent weeks that content generation is based on how the KB is scoured over a few hours.
---
Get gud. 
---
Use 200+ km fleets to minimize the ewar bs. Or bring more logi. Use subcaps - fort damage scales down against them.
---
If defenders drop caps, go smaller - use ikitursas with afterburners, orbit that haw dread and kill it.
---
Use stealth bombers to wreck their battleships in one bomb run.
---
Bring anti ewar ships like remote sensor boosters or cap transmitters.
---
You have options.
---
Get gud.
---
This implies Having self responsibility. One of deadly sins these days.
---
I would wager that most of the 'content creation' this makes is finding sure fire gank kills. I don't play much so could be wrong.
---
Not sure if this is ironic, but that would be a 180 degree turn. You absolute knob.
---
very good yes.
---
I say this with a straight face as a developer: please don't mess with ESI. Whatever cockamamie plan this leads to is going to somehow break the API service itself.
---
haha
---
Or better yet- use an active tanked vni to murder it solo.
---
JUST BIOMASS AND LEAVE, PLS
---
Not sarcasm at all. If ratting and mining is maximum risk for minimal reward why should hauling anything all over null be any different, why should moving anything through null gates be any different for that matter?  If we're going for maximum risk let's pull the trigger and make it across the board and actually spice things up a little.
---
And I'm being completely serious I support this fully.
---
It was just 1 INIT corp, you should have went for it :)
---
&gt; yeah, not what I said, nice conflating though
---
I conflated nothing. If you are in null, you accept risk. You said that was unacceptable.
---
&gt;"But I want my loot drops" How about you HTFU
---
Killing strux are currently cancer and I haven't done one in ages. I have no dog in the loot fight except that I want more risk overall. Hell, I am more AT risk under my ideal system because I won't be hiding my toys in NPC stations because I can't bear the thought of losing them.
---
&gt;rather than RNG bullshit killing rare or valueable items while you are away from the game.  Keep your collector items in NPC null since you're scared to lose them. You can always JC to spin them in your hangar since it's obvious you won't ever risk them.
---
I get that you're afraid you might lose something you love. That's the point. We'd all be in the same boat in that regard. It's exciting, right? You can feel your blood boiling even as you get mad at me for even suggesting you take a risk. You're welcome, mate!
---
I honestly doubt its been a net positive for PvP in general. Blackout has made it harder to actually fight against other NS groups as there is much less content now. And people have to defend rather than be on the offense which slows down everything further.
---
So ye, maybe smaller groups get more content but thats not a net positive for PvP.
---
Not anything like 40 Nyxes, but more along the lines of 4-5 caps and some support ships up from the current 2-3 caps and change. I think the more important factor would be the ability to re-open recently closed hole so it's harder to lock down a hole by leaving crit holes/easier to chase.
---
FWIW, we moved into null npc about the same time the blackout started (set things up prior, didn't get to actually moving in until post).  We're still pretty undiscovered, I think, and I'm sure the blackout has helped to this end, both the info at local.  And again, we've been there since the blackout started.
---
At least in npc null, you really don't need to worry *too* much about being truly 'kicked out' anyway.  People can give you a hard time, but with the plethora of npc stations, you either just end up timezone tanking or moving to another constellation in the region (hasn't come to that yet, honestly... and at this point if we get kicked out, we'll have made *plenty* to fund moving to a new system). 
---
I can't speak to sov null, but I can't see many micro groups trying to set up there?  But I'm unfamiliar with wider Eve practices, so maybe I'm wrong there.
---
Honestly, the biggest downside funny enough is it's just made npc null a much more lonely place, I feel.  People are, for obvious reasons, less chatty and likely to throw up an 'o7' even in passing, for fear of the intel provided to lurking hunters.  And with no local, I can sometimes go hours without seeing another ship (which I think goes to my point about discoverability).
---
What I see now is players using stats to determine if there are extra characters in the system. 
---
I've even effectively cloaky-camped a system, making everyone move to another system.
---
Have you heard about various kinds of insurance? About not putting all eggs into one basket? Other things everyone should be aware of?
---
Basically it’s no secret how to deal with unexpected events and how to minimize impact. But hey, it is a game so no planning should be required!
---
Go see how good a job the community managers are doing in some other games.
---
Exactly, not to mention this would emphasize the fact that the more space there is, the more there is to defend. If you lose a citadel that's been without fuel because of negligence, either take the loss, or set it back up and defend/fuel it.
---
This goes along with the continuing trend of punishing inactivity or mistakes with opportunity for other players. Plus, from the attacker's side, imagine being some rando WH corp who structure bashes a ton and scoops all that loot. That's a damn good story, imo.
---
You're literally one of the best pilots in game. Why not share your knowledge and make a solo/small gang training corp?
---
Looks like you have some issues that are not even remotely connected with citadels.
---
Nope I won’t , if your annoyed good !
---
Barghest
---
There's also this [sign](https://i.imgur.com/RvZqbDJ.png), which I have seen multiple times. (Not my screenshot)
---
How's the cap on fits you've seen? Feasible to neut out with void bombs or no? I know that my alliance fit would probably shrug off a void bomb.
---
Which is one of the reasons why people said the blackout would be counterproductive. A lazy defensive NS is far better for content than a highly active one.
---
But Whiny pvp does ?
---
I like this. It's pisses off risk adverse nacncybois. MUH INTEL. GGRRR CCP.. lmao.
---
This rustles a lot of of jimmies. +1
---
God bless good fight ez clap
---
Nothing is hard about that, but most changes are affecting smaller entities far more than the bigger ones. I just thought that removing sources of intel would actually come give an advantage to smaller entities. If a small alliance has a few people mining in their calm space a few times a week no one will notice.
---
I say do away with tethering altogether. If you want to sit on/in station and hang, just dock. TBH I do think they should improve the look outside to include brackets and basic overview. Now it's just useless.
---
While were at it, lets only let ships that can dock in the structure be the only ships that can tether.
---
Already working on that bot ehh?
---
&gt; I conflated nothing. If you are in null, you accept risk. You said that was unacceptable. 
---
No, that is not what I said.
---
&gt; Killing strux are currently cancer and I haven't done one in ages. 
---
Which is a different problem entirely and needs to be addressed by making them easier to kill.
---
&gt; I get that you're afraid you might lose something you love. That's the point. We'd all be in the same boat in that regard. It's exciting, right? You can feel your blood boiling even as you get mad at me for even suggesting you take a risk. You're welcome, mate! 
---
Not mad at you for suggesting to take risk, mad for suggesting that real life should fuck you over in a game.  It's not exciting at all, it's just dumb and frankly gameplay killing because who wants to have that happen and come back?
---
this is great
---
the current state of eve is such a huge problem because there's no easy solution to it that doesn't either fuck over small groups (malcanis' law) or wreck other shit that would then need far-reaching overhauls as well
---
in general i think there are a few basic changes we could make that would loosen the corset making eve struggle to breathe right now:
---
* delete excavators. rorquals are overpowered in a lot of ways but making them shit at actually mining would go a long way to fixing a lot of the ongoing economic issues in the game right now  
---
* put gates on combat anomalies below 9/10s (i.e. leave sanctums and hordes open), only allow subcaps in. this puts a hard clamp on the isk faucets currently running wild in the game, and also kills boson ratting which has always been problematic  
---
* remove hourly and half-hourly statistics from the ingame map and ESI endpoints. leave 24hour statistics, refresh them at downtime. this prevents tools like dotlan from being sneaky and comparing the current result from the last one and effectively kills instant map intel, while still leaving some tools for basic research before you go scouting or roaming  
---
* delay locational information from killmails and killmail ESI for 2 hours. this lets you show off your frags and battle reports right away, while maintaining some fog of war to prevent zkill scraping bots from alerting people to fights they could third party  
---
* change complete null local blackout to instant local count, 30s-1min delayed member list. this maintains some fog of war allowing people who are willing to actively hunt a grace period on jump-in to actually catch something, while clamping down on problem gameplay styles like bombers just sitting in mining systems all day and tabbing to their client every couple of hours to bomb excavators or whatever
---
there's more to be done and farther reaching changes to be made, but i think those are pretty simple and straightforward and would do a lot for the health of the game
---
The risk you pay for when trying to do to 0.01 isk war and trying to save a few extra isk.
---
well the entire point is to keep them off the grid, if they can't stay on grid then what's the issue
---
this would just be another thing exploited by nullblocs to further entrench themselves, obviously.   
---
they would have the wealth and manpower to abuse it - and would, just putting themselves at a greater advantage than they already are and making their pockets even safer.
---
You’re the kind of person if I came across you irl I’d turn 360 degrees and walk away
---
I think it depends on what you are in and which content you are searching for. If you're looking to gank blingy ships, of course you'll get dropped on no matter what you are in. A lot of nice little brawls are happing in big bloc spaces
---
Not like there's anything else going on in eve worth talking about right now.
---
Prob. Cause it’s a phenomenal not a boost lol 😂
---
I'm currently in a hulk for afk mining, I remember I really enjoying doing it, I'm not skilled enough for a rorq or orca yet, and I think I want to learn to do some pve mission, maybe level 3s? Just wondering what the most efficient way to do it is, also thank you everyone for replying really helpful!
---
:размышление:
---
what bot? I plan to  do by myself, botting is for weak
---
I feel like everyone has a super but me, and my SP is useless compared to people with isk.
---
Injectors need to benefit me too not just new people, sigh.
---
Ur gay pwnd
---
trolling is a art
---
because he doesn't personally know the difference
---
How is blacking out Dotlan a good idea?
---
How would delaying/shutting down the NPC kills in a area/system be a good thing, when the general popular concern is that supers are far too common and there needs to be disruption put into effect to slow down/disrupt infinite ratting anom pockets. It's insane that you can REEE and shitpost so hard at the Reddit that you get the CEO of a multi million dollar company agree with your shitty ideas. I'm all for local blackout, it makes shit kinda dangerous again, but blacking out zKill and Dotlan is dumb and assbackwards with what they are trying to achieve. 
---
We need less isk/less titans in the game Hilmar, figure out how to do that and you'll save your dying game you're putting on preemptive life support.
---
Can I convince you to add another 180 to your turn? I believe that will satisfy both you and op.
---
Hmm odd. I usually hit stop to bring my ship back to a “normal” orientation
---
When whatever shithouse alliance you're in knuckles the fuck up
---
No I don't and I think its a broken mechanic, you shouldn't be able to sit tethered for a long time.
---
You're completely ignorant to the problem with safety for krabs: isk inflation/isk faucets.  Hillmar, the guy with ALL the information is telling you point blank that you krabs are earning TOO much TOO easily and TOO safely.  That's why this whole thing is happening.
---
So what is your actual targeting range? I might be horribly wrong (I never used auto targeting missiles) but the max range of your weapons does not matter, if the target is outside of your targeting range.
---
Fking this. "We want a more dangerous Eve", but we dont really want you to fight. We want you to run around and do entosis. And lets not forget the endless cita timers or the majestic cyno jammers that causes two cap fleets to each guard one side of a gate because no sane person would order initating an attack that requires gating into a fortified position.
---
&gt; Players should have to actively watch each other or groups they want to fight.
---
It would be cool to see cov-ops get used more for... ya know, cov-ops and intel gathering.
---
roleplay
---
yolo everything and lose everything (isk wise) and then build back up
---
be a mid-high level leadership spai (and turn off clone bays in supercap staging systems, or spark off a major war)
---
long term gorilla warfare/terror campaign against a powerblock (like old school MOA, or Olmeca)
---
run alliance or coalition level logistics
---
start badposting on reddit
---
maybe all of the above simultaneously
---
Hecate police skin when!?
---
&gt; Nope - Then again, I don't think tethering should be a thing at all. 
---
Good get rid of it. 
---
Then fix (as in remove) injectors by selling BPCs for accellerators that increase attribs by 20/30/40 points so that "catching up" can be done but still takes some time (and still provides CCP revenue).
---
And change asset safety so it can't be used to voluntarily move stuff and RNG 15% of items inside so that they drop as loot or are destroyed (and get rid of the 15% ransom).
---
Make New Eden Great Again.
---
PS. delete faxes.
---
That hasn't been the case for a long time
---
It really is a testament to their incompetence.  Before the Loki was garbage that nobody would touch with a ten foot pole, now it's the premier T3C and the former glory boy, Proteus, has taken the Loki's former mantle.
---
Every police skin = double your ISK. please.. more.
---
When you say prevent fights do you mean ganks or close fights? Genuinely curious! As a naive observer (I'm bad at Eve, have only lost ships etc etc so I'm probably horribly biased) it seems this helps gankers more than folks wanting to find a good fight. Finding a good fight ultimately requires finding a group and seeing the size of it. This data is much more useful if you're looking for easy kills.  
---
Again I readily admit I'm probably horribly wrong because I'm not good at Eve, just looking for discussion :)
---
Heavy disruptor is 3, officer heavy scram is 10. 
---
Basically depending on what you run into a faction scram and point may not help, dropped on an ishtar the other day and he warped, had at least 4 warp stabs.
---
Nope, I'm not a game designer so I couldn't possibly comment :)
---
I'd maybe change it to 8/10 and 9/10. That would still allow for one or two carriers to rat or a single super, without it entirely destroying the game play style. Carrier ratting is really fun. -or- add more sanctums for those carriers and supers. They are spread out and cannot be bosoned anyway. (I have not ratted like that in 2 years or so, but for limited times less than an hour it was fun. But gets monotonous quick.)
---
I am going to turn 360 degrees away from that idea and walk away
---
fair shout
---
Nope, it's not unpopular. 
---
But the tears coming from nullsec people if it were to happen would probably rise sea levels by a noticieable ammount.
---
Nope, not at all. I always thought tethering should be powered by a service module instead.
---
could do that if you swapped havens and hubs, or removed rock havens entirely, or reworked their spawns
---
boson ratting is *dumb*
---
&gt; ctly, not to mention this would emphasize the fact that the more space there is, the more there is to defend. If you lose a citadel that's been without fuel because of negligence, either take the loss, or set it back up and defend/fuel it.
---
NEXUS1975 for CSM!
---
Then I want to be able to warp (not jump) to a cyno even though it is outside of the system.
---
Caps and supers should not compete with regular T1 subs for materials. Every other "power ship" requires special materials to build which are limited/not as scalable in source and has the potential to spike prices if demand is too high. Faction ships require LP, T3 ships require sleeper loot, T2 ships require moongoo.
---
Caps should require a second limiter resource, and Supers require that and one more.
---
DID SOMEONE SAY CAPITAL FIGHT!?
---
Nobody is going to use them. And the few that do will have a massive advantage over the other side.
---
Why the fuck would we even engage in low-sec.   
---
That sounds like the most idiotic idea  i've heard in a while. 
---
DURRHURRDUR LeT's gO To ThE EnEmY's HoMe CAUSE THAT'S A INTELLIGENT WARPLAN 
---
But its cool you can act like hot shit.
---
No discussing other games. take your hippie love in outside with the planetside players. ^^^^^^^^^/s
---
If a titan dies in delve and there is no kill mail. Did it happen.
---
I did it two or three times (number of havens). It was fun to watch the damage numbers scroll. Maybe good for boson practice. But the mechanic of hitting one button and mayyyybe hitting another 5-6 keys to clean up every 5 minutes in a nigh impregnable fortress with a cyno seems pretty fucking safe to me.
---
Everything that isn't a boon to my singular playstyle should be changed.
---
LONG LIVE THE KING!
---
You need to have an aggression timer. You can get this easily by shooting a gate or wormhole.
---
[Example video by terran4444](https://youtu.be/_Jfdxvt7DDE?t=59)
---
No you just need a timer. So shoot a gate or wormhole or a can you ejected.
---
Now THAT I'd pay irl money for
---
Xtra_squishy can then meme even more. I.e. "pulling someone over for speeding, the fine? Ur ship license is revoked and ur ship will be towed (destroyed)"
---
r/Eve will outlive Eve itself. Don't worry on that
---
So, they would be in the same situation that every other group of 10-20 dudes in the game is (aside from the better income in a wormhole)?
---
I know what you are trying to do: you are trying to create quick undocks to specific celestials.  I guess that's ok since that already exists.
---
But I don't think I want to have citadels tilted off axis. That would look weird.  If I wanted a "true" space environment I would play another game.  Messing with people's sense of what is "up" is disorienting.
---
has there ever been? it's usually the same exact thing...blue donut... bots... grr goons...CCP is shit...gate to Stain
---
I'm pretty sure you would be even more upset if they nerfed what actually needed to be nerfed: capital power projection.
---
This is the old, only slightly Zionist, Uncle Sam a la Soviets. There are stronger versions with more emphasis on what they deemed to be most offensive attributes at any given time.
---
Why? Bombers are supposed to specialize in killing bigger ships.
---
I'm a small guy, I personally rarely use zkil unless someone is acting in certain ways that makes me think they are upto something (mostly stalling, things like following without engaging, crashing gate back and forth and a few other things) and I actually use the ingame map for roaming so....
---
wtf
---
Already?
---
I just came back
---
That's not too bad an idea. You could still crab safely, bit it would cost you. 
---
Make the structures destroyable for maximum fun.
---
People used to band together for protection and to optimize gathering and sharing resources to produce more ships to blow each other up with.  Groups nowadays seem to have missed the second part and basically consider the empire building to be the endgame.        
---
       
---
People and CCP both should try to figure out what hat EVE is going to be wearing so everyone can get on the same page.
---
I like that idea. I'd do it faster, one year is too long to leave litter lying around.
---
Police Stratios. The spinning satellite dish turns into a spinning police light. Fit with Radio and Gamma crystals for red/blue pew pew. Put them into two groups and stagger activation so the two colors alternate while firing.
---
Well I am cap stable, not sure if a void bomb would be enough
---
Income in wormholes is actually quite low aside from the roaming dread trio.
---
Use a double or triple faction scram maulus navy issue.
---
You think 12 bombers should win over 10-20 caps?
---
I mean there really is nothing to argue there.
---
Moving at a glacial pace. All the changes recently are in response to stuff players have been complaining about for a long time. Local as intelligence gathering. Too much isk/inflation. Bots. It's like they woke up after a 5 year slumber and said "oh yeah the changes we made didn't work out".
---
Level 3? Gila. Moving into Rattlesnake to solo 4's. Great ships, but too expensive for most PVP. Wormhole is an exception.
---
So you’d be happier with slightly increased mass on the biggest doors? Because that is a far simpler approach.
---
Being able to directly control and reopen holes is the wrong direction. No one should have control over it. The entire appeal of wormhole space is dealing with whatever connection Bob wills.
---
I am going to turn 720 degrees away from you and hug the first person I walk into.
---
People got used to it.  Hard to blame them for utilizing a game mechanic added by the devs.  Yeah, they probably never should have added it, but taking it out... well, two wrongs don't make a right.
---
r/eve just needs more blue hair dye and grape drank. The toxicity is off the charts. I can't even...
---
I assume it is. The only sound I hear are the shield/armor/hull alarms and when aura says warp drive active.
---
with the blackout boson ratting is suicidal but without it, it's stupid free isk
---
I've actually made or been part of several corporations dedicated to training new players. They've never worked out though, due to my inability to actively recruit.
---
Are you able to fly a cap ?
---
That's not what the wormholer narrative has said the last two years amigo.
---
Dank..
---
We've got a backlog of stuff like you can't imagine... Hopefully get a few vids from 2018/earlier this year out over next few months :D
---
Anecdotally, yeah we've been finding the blackout is helping us get more content too, though we do tend to get turbo blobbed most times it's an option still.
---
We're still finding our feet with the Ikis, maybe once we've got a better understanding of the comp limits :)
---
r/Eve will be around as long as EvE is around unless something better becomes available and popular. The official forums will pretty much never be it while CCP is running them. If there was another better option maybe. When Kugu was prominent nobody gave a shit about r/eve except like test. It closed down people moved here. Really it's not about the platform so much as where people choose to go.
---
If you are AFKing for long enough to get the station where you keep your stuff blown up, you are not "living" there.
---
&gt; It's too costly to have competition, so businesses will naturally try to eliminate it -- either by buying it out or resorting to much more nefarious tactics.
---
Honestly, I don't know how anyone plays Eve and doesn't recognize this lol.
---
Everyone that talks about removing asset safety likes to forget that fact.
---
Aw damn, they ended up simply scamming that Maja guy over their own failure to uphold their own code. I honestly thought those guys were deep into some pirate RP, but they ended up showing they were simple scammers. And I was looking forward to the ending of that story after that grandiose, albeit delusional, build-up.
---
Sure I'll play, new player here:
---
Bought T1 frigates by mining in my venture to pvp in with my sub 2m sp because of blackout. Null is now empty, got some kills at first, now its a ghost town other than the south and far east where the big guys live.
---
So I went to do missions! Chose a mix of security and distribution missions that pay far less than just venture mining. FAR less.
---
I received a story line mission that says level 1. Jump in my punisher and warp in... 8 cruisers, in range of each other, as the first wave. This is a level one story mission? Eventually, using hit and run tactics and loosing all my ships but the last, I clear the site for that sweet sweet $238,000 reward (half a load of veldspar in my venture). Nine more parts to go that will surely not escalate in difficulty..right?....right? FML and FTG
---
That there is just no reason for wars and the lack of balls from alliance leaders to just do wars for no reasons.
---
You do know how nul sov works, nope? Killing toasters counters toasting, strange that!
---
The alliance owns all of the structures of significance. Including the 1DQ-A market. If you were to place your own structure and turned it into a large market, the policy is your structure would be nationalized. They own all of the moons. They own all of the refineries. If you place a structure you are heavily regulated with ACL's, tax rates, fittings, etc. The alliance defacto owns the mining and ratting anoms. I would say that the alliance owns a majority of the means of production. 
---
But you're right. We're also a welfare capitalist autocracy. Individuals are allowed to make unlimited profit. The state funds  any losses that a defense fleet might have protecting individual owned assets. Etc.
---
But I wouldn't translate this into real life too much. Eve has a lot of different systems that have no analog to the real world. I'd never choose to live in a dictatorship or autocracy in real life, but in Eve I' be worried if a alliance branded themselves as a democracy.
---
Note during the Sov interference you did nothing but run... 
---
Note during the fight in highsec, we came back into a lost fight for some fun.  
---
Who are the good sports again?
---
New PvP mode - spin the Citadel 180 while neut hauler undocks, so their insta BM bounces them off the station.
---
FW scrubs... Everyone knows you don't put your main in Faction Warfare!
---
Asset safety if removed will likely be in null only.... Maybe lowsec. It does have implications for  players who have gone awol though.
---
What narrative have you been reading?
---
drones don't give killmails tho
---
You were stating absolutist statements. *everyone* and the like. Which is just absurd.
---
Reddit.
---
Meanwhile, on total war subreddit a community manager goes into nsfw posts and throws a tantrum over disliking their contents.
---
Even if he's paid for it, Falcon is still doing a pretty good job.
---
Sorry Mr Panfam... Go get fucked by a goon
---
I SCIENCE'D! It a few years ago, you need the burst jammer
---
So, killing our defensive Toasters hurts during an attack. I am not sure who you are, but if you were with FEDUP in the past you would know that Defensive Entosis down opens the door for the attacker. We now have to reship and get back out there possibly costing us the fight. Make sense?
---
thanks for your input, pl line member XDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
It's just comprehension issues.
---
This is just a revenge post. Wormholes are much more dangerous as they are now. It just means you can’t freely afk evict people out of spite with your supers.
---
You should be able to get out of those systems in smaller ships. A slow aligning battleship might get in some trouble but I doubt you’re using one of those. 
---
Are you using autopilot or something? If so, stop. It’s a bad habit. Also, don’t waste time! When you jump a gate, hit the jump button for the next one right away. No need to sit there. 
---
If you are having a lot of trouble getting out, get in just a pod and fly to one of the market stations like Jita 4-4. Buy and fit yourself a mission ship and use the Agency to find a new career agent.
---
o7 Welcome to horde!
---
Really good astero pilots in WHs will use faction hornets and continuously swap them out as they take damage and they will defang you. They have huge shields and recharge very fast. I tanked and defanged both a stratios and an astero doing that before they quit and let me go.
---
Shooting targets of opportunity &lt;&gt; entosis warfare... Sorry if you're bitter about us shooting you after you left FW and reset everyone... Funny how that works
---
Well that's just horseshit.
---
Ah ok.
---
&gt; that real life should fuck you over in a game. 
---
If your AFK period is planned, then you should move your stuff, or at least the stuff you can't bear to lose to a safe station.
---
If it's unplanned would feel bad for you but It's still a risk you would be sharing equally with all of u and you could still hedge the risk by having your collector stuff in a safe station. In any case, after an emergency that takes you away from the game for some time, you probably won't give the loss of pixels the same importance you give them now.
---
atleast one of us gets laid then
---
how wrong you are sir haha. I wouldn't be caught dead krabbing. It's the most mind numbing bullshit and I can't understand how anyone has fun doing it. Moved to wormholes to have access to a null static to be able to have on demand content and it's dope as fuck.
---
 you mean scam orders with shill bidders?
---
Only if you have the mistaken belief that the existing standing fleets can barely cover a region.
---
When a huge number of caps drop and over-kill a roam, that's not even close to all the caps available in the existing standing fleets.
---
Citadels didn't exist before and many people didn't signed for them. Capitals didn't exist at some point and many people would tell you they'd have a better time without them. Things change. Adapt or leave like every one was told to do all these years? Unless you have an argument for the sake of the game itself to say that's it's not a good thing. But numbers seem to show that it is.
---
In your book of things that only, and disproportionately, affect small corps?
---
Well the main reason is battle reports especially for fleet fights to determine efficiencies and bragging / trolling rights. And to have a kill history to brag about. Other tha. That, I don't know
---
It's not that's why I included both. It's easier to navigate dotlan layout that the retarded in-game version
---
I agree. But could be one of 35 ventures. Just saying.
---
In most countries, they put the criminals themselves into prisons, not the weapons they used.
---
I personally like them tidally locked. I wouldn't care (much) if they moved but I wonder if this would place unnecessary demand on the servers.
---
But when destroyed it does damage to everything within 80 km. The closer to the explosion the higher the damage.
---
isnt it drifter/jove-stuff that you're breaking into?
---
also lol @ eve lore
---
Naglfar!
---
`&lt;&gt;` is not does not equal that would be `!=`  
---
Now lets go over your other points "Possibility of SOL having caps" while that may be true, zkill shows it's not very likely
---
SOLs Zkill for Capitals:

I’m really curious on how to get off a low sec gate without dying. I was hauling and making some good turnover, but when I go through a bottleneck 0.4 system there always seems to be a couple pirates on the gate as soon as I get there. The second I de-cloak I’m jammed, webbified and warp blocked. Is there any counter to this? I’d like to be able to just buzz past them if I can, but the industrial ships take 10 years to align lol.
---
I mean not bitter about it my friend, just responding to it as eve players do ya?
---
I can't find a corp that wants me. Currently skilled almost strictly for stealth bombers, I just wanna shoot torps at people. Applied to Wingspan and Brave Newbies so we'll see.
---
&gt; • No asset safety - you want asset safety, ~~keep it fueled~~ play a different game 
---
FTFY
---
The fact that while I love how CCP is making it much more dangerous in null, it feels like the side effect of the blackout changes is that it will force the smaller groups to merge into the larger blocs to feel safe.
---
While I understand their intention, I feel like an IHUB upgrade that allows only alliance members to see local is needed, even if its delayed, its better than nothing. 
---
I am actually loving the game right now, but am worried about the long term effect blackout will have on the smaller groups
---
NPC null is a very different experience yeah and was specifically what I was talking about. Sounds pretty cool what you're doing glad you're enjoying it. :D
---
&gt; Use stats on activity to discriminate against more active groups
---
Split your group in-game, use out-of-game tools to remain cohesive.
---
&gt; Use NPC's to declare war and start invasions on specific groups based upon activity metrics or accumulated wealth
---
&gt; I mean steal a page from older games and have the intensity scale based upon isk generated/accumulated in a system
---
Population density is very poorly related to size.  A small group using the hell out of the constellation they own is a higher density than a large bloc leaving lots of Esoteria not heavily farmed.
---
&gt; You can tweak anom nerfs to work on a logarithmic scale. It wouldn't effect smaller groups as much. There would be a calculable carrying capacity
---
Then the blocs conquer a lot more space, and just split their ridiculously-overpowered standing fleets into multiple massively-overpowered standing fleets.
---
Millions of planets populated in the billions adds up.
---
Too bad the duration on this items was so low... I wish I could keep my character on them for the entire month! :)
---
Citadels without an active module and fuel are cancer. If they have no fuel or active modules, they should be able to be killed ANYTIME. The fact that people can anchor them for protection, and *still* get 2 timers, is utter bullshit. For 500m you get tether and safe harbor and don't even have to fuel it. You want to solve citadel spam and the cancer it is, there ya' go. /u/CCP_Falcon
---
The will to login. Nothing seems exciting or engaging until I get the ping that says "login supers and join fleet". Otherwise I stare at the launcher while I play other things.
---
Please try to understand the phrases "up to" or "worst-case scenario" before continuing to insist those are the common results.
---
I’m doing the Sisters of EVE arc right now, had to do 19 jumps to get there from home. Then realized I needed a stronger ship from my hangar, so I jumped on a corvette and hit autopilot while I went to walk the dog. I’m new to this game, if I got popped in my free ship with an empty hold, it wouldn’t cost me anything. Probably would be the merciful thing to do since it would have at least put me at my destination, lol.
---
Good for you... Pity you ran away though
---
wahhh wahhhhh 
---
shut up lol
---
Note during the interference we killed bunch of stuff while "running"
---
Note during fight of hisec a 400 man alliance clearly underestimated a small low sec group.
---
Note you seem to have lost this one.
---
Note on your last sentence just lol …
---
cool stuff man, mayb someday i'l fly snaked 700M ships for my "cheap stuff" haha - color me jealous!
---
That is an option yes. Just make sure you don't have implants in your skull to lose
---
Life is generally unplanned and I don't think you should lose stuff afk even if it's just a break from the game not just emergencies.  This is a game and should not consume your life.
---
Your comparison would hold water if SOL used capitals since formation in March... We haven't though, so you have no way to know.
---
Go one step further: when someone lights a cyno you can literally see it in the sky if your camera is pointed the right direction and you are within range. The closer the brighter. 
---
Yeah yeah. Light years. Don’t care. It’s your onboard scanner representing the cyno.
---
I have mixed feelings about this. On one hand it's a chore, but on the other hand it gives "proportional effort" so if you want better updated intel you have to pay more attention.
---
Automatic D-scan would be like having a 14.3 AU Overview.
---
So far with the new update to the vni stats haven’t had much problems with them they die easy to the stratios neuts I just kind wish I could push more dps with it. Now if you where to fly a legion how would you run it ? I couldn’t ever really fit a legion to my liking with out spending a lot of isk
---
I think most of the people here (not accusing you directly) advocating for the little guys are actually big guy krabs using this argument in a similar was as "Think of the children!".
---
Uses caps daily vs a group that hasn't used a cap in 4months, I know who I'd put my money on.
---
Now i've seen everything, someone remembering POS warfare fondly.  I agree with the timer mechanics, just... not the POSes themselves.
---
Ok, i don't mind taxes, plays into lore and isk sinks are good. Will not fix bots. 
---
What they need to do to is impose an exponential increase in broker fee everytime a buy or sell order is changed. Or change broker fee to be based off total order value instead of the change amount. Or limit the numer of changes allowed period. Or make the time between changes 5 hours instead of 5 mins. Or limit the number of changes allowed for all your orders in a given time frame. Could connect skills to all of those too. Make people be strategic. I'm a fan of giving people 2-5 changes cheap, but after that, make people start thinking about changing.
---
I run a lazer fit PvE legion, it works on most drones but you need a web or to keep them at optimal.
---
If the frig drones get in and scram you youre stuck until you can burn an alt over and kill it because youre never going to hit it yourself.
---
Spent a good 30mins before slowboating trying to hit the damn thing before i got rescued.
---
Only Rorquals can, because only Rorquals are under 1 billion kg in mass. All other capitals are over the mass limit.
---
double your bounty payout (as in player bounty, not npc)
---
Might as well just get it all compiled in one nice little thread, right? ;)
---
The only one that is completely bad is the minmatar one. I use the other three regularly.
---
Amarr is great for citadel sieging to boost capacitor. You can also use it against subcap fleets to slow them down, both are very useful.
---
Caldari/Gallente are obviously critical with their 30% hp buff. The Caldari one in particular is great, because that's un-neutable shield HP, and it also messes with armor rep capacitor. If you're one of the few entities with a shield super fleet, it's pretty ungodly.
---
The minmatar one is pretty much trash. It would be a pretty convoluted set of circumstances in which it would be useful.
---
If you want to talk about buffs, definitely the minmatar one needs help. I'd also like to see them on citadels (maybe fortizars and up) at the expense of offensive capability.
---
at least back then the blue doughnut had 2 halves and were at least pretending to shoot each other.
---
these days they aren't even pretending to be angry with each other any more.
---
Of course... I just dislike reddit narratives. And as I said, i give you props for not blueballing us.
---
&gt;  Nine more parts to go that will surely not escalate in difficulty..right?....right? FML and FTG
---
What level 1 mission is this? You didn't start an epic arc mish, did you?
---
I've noticed there are a bunch of ships that seem to be either straight-up useless (outclassed by other strictly superior ships, even regarding things like cost-effectiveness) or pushed into a crazy small niche. Don't really care for that, but maybe it's the way it has always been.
---
And instead of actually fixing the problems they just slap on the laziest solution possible.
---
the ancient earth ships were too busy writing reports about what massive a\*\*holes supercap pilots in new eden are
---
Now to give Caldari another EWAR type in line with other races. ESI Denial, and make Widow excel at this role pls
---
Please come down to lowsec and test your hypothesis.
---
Same experience here. Tons more content since blackout started. I'm getting fatigued from the number of pings for tackled caps every night.  Took my seven rorq kills last night and went to bed. :P
---
This would be amazing actually
---
&gt;[wormholers] have easier access to highsec or low sec stations than alot of null sec.
---
Yeah... if the null-corp has 0 jump freighters...
---
Yea an active tanked, blaster boat will def die to a strat ) 
---
I would spend a fair amount of isk on any t3c, for a legion I’d go ham/drones/passive tank (reactive hardener always) if I was solo, might use the neuts if with one or two others.
---
What makes you relic cans are ancient earth ships?
---
Polo
---
Please try to understand this: I do not believe it is possible even in a worse case scenario to use double the memory just from using 64-bit. Cite your sources.
---
They don't get tethered instantly but can dock before anything happens easily because of how ticks and load timers etc work. 
---
So safe travel with a jump freighter isn't all that hard for experienced pilots ( to the point where folks can do it with low to no error rates ).
---
The reality is at any moment a hostile can setup and shut down all your options for travel ( no pods no ships no clones ), compared to NS where even the most determinant attacker has almost no ability to impact your import/export ability in any meaningful way. 
---
This is because in wormholes the mechanics favor attackers while in NS the transport mechanics favor the defender so if both sides play flawlessly in Wormhole space your not hauling in Null sec the people wanting to transport win so even if you play it out perfectly a 100% catch rate isn't happening.
---
I am not the one who made the reddit post bud
---
dunno are taxes not just on npc stations? if so  dodge it and sell/buy in player markets.
---
Nope and nope.
---
I think 20 ships designed to counter another ship class should be able to counter 20 of that countered ship.
---
\- It's not Earth stuff you're breaking into.  There's been several empires that rose and disappeared since the Eve gate collapsed.
---
\- The people in the cluster know Earth exists/existed.  They don't know where Earth is.  Or more precisely, they don't know where the Eve cluster is in relation to Earth.
---
\- There's been no contact since the Eve gate collapsed, so we don't know if an Earth-based "empire" still exists.  It's been a very, very long time.
---
They don’t have zkill and other tools like dotlan or enemy reporting tools
---
why would you try to scam, if you could sell it legit for same price, if only you'd sell it before the item's usability expires.
---
That's some good range. During entosis test server runs the cruise Barghest memed on many noobs
---
Ah well, was worth a shot :) would love to see a docking ring / mooring mechanic though - maybe with Titans/Supers appearing even if their pilots were logged off.
---
I can agree with everything but asset safety.  I don't think that should be continent of the powered status of the citadel.  The reason being that currently reinforcing an upwell structure into  it's final timer PUTS it into low power, removing the possibility of putting it into asset safety.  I have said before that asset safety should work as follows: You put stuff in a citadel.  You are offered to pay the asset safety fee UP FRONT. Anything you pay the fee on gets put into asset safety if the structure it is in does. Anything that is in the citadel that you DO NOT pay the asset safety fee on DROPS!  The only thing I would agree to is removing the option of Paying the asset safety fee if the structure is put into low power for whatever reason, making it impossible to acid safety something once the structures and low power. however anything already paid up into assets safety would be safe if the structure enters low power.
---
Imagine drinking the FCON Koolaid this hard 2 years after FCON died. I'm actually kind of impressed.
---
I gave you solutions to help you hedge but you don't seem willing to make the effort to avail yourself of them. You seem to think CCP owes you safety in space they told Concord to warn you is full of danger.
---
You also don't lose all of your stuff in my suggestion, so it's hardly like you have to start over.
---
I hate to say it but it sounds like you're more risk averse than you're willing to admit. If the idea of losing non-existent items consumes your life, then I suggest you seek other avenues of entertainment.
---
Is this bait? Or just plain stupidity?
---
I dont understand this. It's a massive immobile structure and you want it to be gimped vs space ships? Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
If anything, an astra, a fort, and a keep should be on its own, able to take on a fleet proportional to its size. anything less is pretty unrealistic unless it's a refinery or engineering structure
---
When you have a moment, would you mind saying a little more about what the guys who caught you did? I'm genuinely fascinated by the idea of a solo bomber going after a Domi, it seems like it would be suicide but if someone got it to work that's pretty cool.
---
&gt; They own all of the moons. They own all of the refineries. If you place a structure you are heavily regulated with ACL's, tax rates, fittings, etc. The alliance defacto owns the mining and ratting anoms. I would say that the alliance owns a majority of the means of production.
---
That's actually a very Georgist policy. Products of your labor (mining/ratting/industry) largely belong to you with some taxes, but economic rent from space (land analogy), protected by and enabled by the collective, belong to the collective. The fees the alliance charges for owning a private structure essentially amount to a "space value tax" (land value tax IN SPACE).
---
When you take a moment to think about things, the way that GSF does taxes is quite economically optimal, economists would love it since the tax payers are also post-scarcity transhumans who really don't have any demands from the government. You have public funded infrastructure which greatly reduces the barrier to entry to doing any kind of business (like, you can start building supercaps at competitive prices using Alliance industry lines as long as you have like 60 days of industry skills, and isk to buy a BPC pack/minerals). The 3 main taxes are a minor tax on production (10%), a land value tax on the limited commodity of space, and a sales tax that's really a Value Added Tax since it's a tax that applies to raw materials and captures value on every transaction. That's basically the tax combination that creates the least deadweight loss.
---
Solved the range issue, now my issue is that sleeppers agrro to 370km
---
thanks for your input, karmafleet line member XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
&gt;So then the question: Why do people say that new eden people know nothing of earth? The star maps in those computers alone should have shown them.
---
Remember, thousands of years have passed. More time than between now and when Hammurabi wrote his code (iirc). It is entirely possible that what they see is broken and written in what is effectively gibberish. Think about how hard it was for us to figure out heiroglyphs before the Rosetta stone. And seeing as any maps they might recover or decipher would all reference stars and celestials that nobody in New Eden can identify, it's about as useful as having a starmap drawn by a very imaginitive child.
---
But the easiest answer to this is pretty simple: EVE lore relies heavily on the idea of historical decay. I honestly can't find a proper term for this, but if you've ever read any of Asimov's *Empire* or *Foundation* books and seen how those stories refer to the *Robots* as a far-distant, lost history, you'll know what I'm talking about.
---
It can be a bit of a stretch, but the general idea that given a complex enough society, enough time, and people being people, its not hard to imagine history and records constantly being lost. Especially in a scenario like EVE where there was an initial catastrophic event that threw everyone back into the industrial age.
---
He's right.
---
You either went AFK for a planned outage but were too lazy to move your stuff or you had a genuine emergency and you're placing too much value of objects that only exist in a database.
---
This entire post makes too much sense. You suck. My 3 man Corp should not have to go through so much suffering to take regions of space from active alliances
---
Lies.
---
Just like in EVE.
---
EVE is real.
---
So you want to tell me how orange juice taste like when you never had any to begin with?
---
Next thing you want to tell a surgeon how to do surgery when you never went to med school ?
---
Or perhaps you want tell us how to build a airplane when  you have  never worked on one ? 
---
Should I ask a blind man to drive too while am at it ?
---
This convo is over sir!
---
No but you brought up the 'offensive action' we undertook by shooting your toasting ships. It was simply targets of opportunity. Not us attacking your sov...
---
-light cyno on tackled rorq    
---
-enemy supers jump in      
---
    
---
i see nothing wrong w/ this, makes using em risky
---
how do I catch those quad-stabbed ishtars then
---
Big market players use automation &amp; scripting to update their orders... People did in WoW and EVE is even more tech-savvy and autistic.
---
Sadly range not enough as sleepers aggro upon shooting to 370km
---
Right. If a station blew up you would think a lot would be destroyed but some stuff could possibly survive. It should maybe even be damaged aswell. Or not, that just seems more "realistic" to me. Then again, I don't own a citadel yet, so don't have much to speak on.
---
anyway, locals don't like it when you point out obvious shit that their game is dead, prepare for downvote brigades...
---
Even tho i don't fly caps, caps still affect me. They devalue the minerals i mine. They present overwhelming force that stops any fight i try and start. My cruisers get alphaed by them. They deflate the isk i can make by ratting endlessly. There's a laundry list of problems that caps cause for me despite my unwillingness to sink another 20m skill points into flying them.
---
And then you get nuted because any domi without neuts, a scram, a grappler, mjd, and mwd is a seriously big piece of trash meme. Also undocking a domi without ec drones is pretty fucking hilarious
---
Yo, Dude, that's just bullshit. Have you lived in a WH? I don't mean day tripping or throwing up a small tower (yeah I'm old) for alt PVE but live in it exclusively?
---
Can this really be considered a PvP commentary when it takes 18 fucking minutes to get to the PvP part of the video?
---
Just what I said.  They jump in cloaked, decloak, point, orbit, neut/drain and torp. 
---
It will require some practice and you could get caught yourself. I was stabbing between toons and watching TV at the same time. That was with local active (and several years ago).
---
Destroyers and Battlecruisers get SWAT skins.
---
Frigates and Cruisers get Civil Protection/Police skins.
---
Thanks, buddy!  I'm pretty agnostic on most of these changes overall, honestly... we just keep doing what we do.
---
I bet in 2 years eve will lose 25-50% of current amount players online.
---
There are timestamps in the description!
---
How many missiles does it take to kill 1 rat?
---
Been saying this for years
---
that's what CCP most likely meant as "requiring a full rework" currently skins don't work as modules, doing what you describe will require just that - reworking the whole SKIN mechanic.
---
Sorry, I need to ask. Are you  5 physically, or just mentally?
---
Hey! Everything in your post is wrong, GJ!
---
The fact that 50-75% of what's wrong with the game now came from the citadel expansion
---
marshal,barghest
---
What kind of dps with hams/drones ?
---
Hes not...at all.
---
I agree with delayed killmails. Would remove fitting from them while keeping total worth. 
---
However things like map statistics are free intel.
---
I have, it's not bs.
---
^ underrated comment
---
&gt;"Can you believe that? How the hell are we supposed to build a peaceful colony out here when all the locals keep dropping *destroyers* on us? This is so unfair..."
---
Probably a little more historically accurate.
---
Might be just me, but I'm not a fan of "bring half the mass of a hole, so when you retreat the hole closes and nobody else can follow". Seems like too easy of a way to avoid consequences in a game that's all about consequences. Have only holes collapsed by mass/passage leave a signature for like 15-30 minutes, while naturally expired holes don't.
---
I don't like that I can't hover over my skill queue and see how many sp it would take to skill them by applying sp. I want to hover over a skill in queue and it should tell me how many sp it will cost, how many sp it will cost to apply sp to the skill I hover or click on and how much it will cost to train it and the rest in queue before it. I know tools exists and I can start clicking tabs but fuck all that shit. Gimme ez.
---
&gt; Changing the rules afterwards isn't coo
---
OK, I agree with you. I want my minmatar nano***s back. It wasn't cool they changed them after releasing them and goddamned give me back my indestructible stations.
---
Oh, I guess you didn't mind those changes, right?
---
Reddit doesn’t know what they’re talking about. Less than 10% of the eve population even knows how wormholes work. Less of those know how to live in or run sites. Lots living in wormholes don’t even know how to roll doors effectively.
---
That’s eve overall. How many of those few % even come to reddit?
---
It's a benefit. You spam space with structures store shit randomly for use then everything is safe if you forget and said place gets blown up. I call that a big benefit.
---
That is not the reality at all.  The mechanics favor the defenders...heavily.
---
If you are AFK already how does that make null even less populated? You aren't even there to begin with.
---
Thank you for being you.  The community is better because of it.
---
Nope, more like in general.
---
Talocan, Sleeper, Yan Jung, Takhmal (sp), 3 Jove dynasties, Triglavians, and Drifters. All predate the current empires, and still came much later than the originals from Earth.
---
well we  would. if you  didnt have entire galmil on batphone lmao
---
Because you're going to come back in that situation.
---
Whoa whoa whoa.. are you insinuating all of the wormholers on Reddit don't know what they are talking about? Brother you are going to get lynched.
---
As mentioned elsewhere, a faction scram is your only real option for subcaps. You could probably make some crazy fit with an officer scram, but there's no way you're doing anything useful with a heavy scram or disruptor.
---
Don't put a Titan on a citadel that you don't have access to the docking list?
---
You think just because I fly capitals that I don’t know how it is to be on the other end of cap fleets ? 
---
What you think your the only one that gets overpowered by capitals?
---
You only know one side of the situation.
---
I suggest skill up like the rest of us that  fly cap not just hate because we choose to take the time to skill. 
---
experience what it is to fly a cap then your input might be taken more seriously by me at least.
---
Fanbois cant even see how valid my question is. Do you not love the IP? Do you not want to see EVE survive and become ground breaking again? No amount of downvoting or hiding from the fact will change that eventually EVE will shutter it's servers and be lost if it doesnt adapt, evolve.
---
I like this idea, and hey it sounds like an isk sink too !
---
You need to be 410+, check the video for an example.
---
No you.
---
Oh look another comment bitching at the post for having the same topic
---
Imagine the content jump freighters would generate
---
I was just correcting first off, and thats fine if you dont see it that way, but could have cost us the timer. shooting the marauder was a target of opportunity, of course we were not happy about it. However shooting our entosis ships during an active timer is an attack from our perspective.
---
They aren't on bat phone. Technically they are our 'coalition'
---
&gt;Infiltrator IIs only go 3450m/s (with drone nav)
---
This isn't true actually, with drone navigation 5 an Infiltrator II goes 3450m/s WITHOUT a drone nav. That's further boosted to 4475 m/s with the drone nav. If they're flying a higher speed interceptor, then Valkyries can go up to 4875 m/s with 274 drone dps, which is still pretty scary. A malediction for example would need to overheat or have 3+ nanos in order to outrun the valkyries.
---
Failing this, as you said light drones can be used but they still get a scary amount of dps for an interceptor (184 dps for Acolytes and 211 with Hobgoblins, assuming 2 DDA's)
---
The point of it closing is to cause danger. If you get rolled into a chain you don’t know or haven’t scanned, depending on your ship and the static’s, it can take you 6 hours to get home. Otherwise you have to SD, or get killed by locals.
---
Honestly, it just goes to show how much of a hivemind this sub is. Falcon spouts out some shit, then more from CCP reinforce the same shit and this sub goes into a full "do this do this". They dont even stop to think but instead just mimic.
---
Its quite scary honestly.
---
&gt; Or more precisely, they don't know where the Eve cluster is in relation to Earth.
---
Other than speculating on [the Bootini Star](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/EVE_Gate#The_Bootini_Star) (23346 A.D.), did anyone ever know where the Milky Way and New Eded were in relation to each other?
---
Add a delay to nullsec local
---
That’s not what I said. Nice work trying to spin things though. 
---
On topic: which source has been telling you how much more profitable wormholes are than null anom ratting or mining? Because I can guarantee you they left out some details.
---
Years ago this term was used by goons to describe anyone not from goons. Nothing really special.
---
It’d be nice to see covert ops get some interesting mechanics. Maybe the could have long range fitting scanners or something like deplorable drones that would stay in a system and provide dscan info that would make them a true long term reconnaissance platform instead of whatever they are now.
---
Years ago this term was used by goons to refer to anyone not from goonswarm. Like “person from general public” in relation to special club.
---
I notice that the vast majority recommending nerfs to Upwell are looking for even easier kills.
---
Though I don't disagree that unfueled Upwell shouldn't have benefits, fueled ones should certainly be more defensive than they currently are as a consequence.
---
The bait frigate in faction warfare that has a Arty Loki alt cloaked 70km off........
---
I disagree, and if EVE is a sandbox meant to correlate to reality as Hilmar says, then what your large blocks are doing it totally consistent with the settling of land seen in history. At first when single families come in and claim land, they are exposed to local and environmental dangers. As a society builds that society begins to protect its self and its individuals become "safer" to increasing degrees. But they never are truly , completely safe. The empires in eve null are not "safe" they have created a civilization.
---
I had a local convention center (one block away from me) get attacked by terrorists who did not like the convention. Armed, they wanted to kill as many as they could before setting off a car bomb. The police eventually killed them. If you and your best pals roll into my relatively small town killing folks, the police are going to get you. As would a militia. You get no cloaks, no magic cars to go through roadblocks unhindered. You will die.
---
In eve you get that magic hiding cloak and the magic way to ignore interdiction. Fuck you can have both on the same ship! You get to respawn and do it again! What else do you want to cause loss to people and the society they have built?
---
This may clue you in why I am tired of cowards. Both real, and so many in this game.
---
So be it... I will respect your point of view. Have a good day.
---
Umm, right. Because I must be wrong for giving you a case of feels?
---
Problem: I'm going on a three month sabbattical
---
Solution: move your stuff to safety
---
Problem: I lost my job
---
Solution: move your stuff to safety before the sub runs out.
---
Problem: I was hit by a truck and had amnesia for six months. I came back to eve as quickly as possible because I don't want this game to consume me where's my stuff?
---
Solution: See a counselor. You need to get a good handle on what really matters more than the 15% of fake assets you can't find.
---
Problem: I want to play eve in a risky space but I don't want to lose anything. I am consumed by the ide of risking my stuff.
---
Solution: WoW is -&gt; that way.
---
Eve as a sandbox isn't for everyone. I don't recommend it to people who get emotionally attached to the space pixels and hate the idea they can lose assets even through no fault of their own. It doesn't mean that there's anything wrong with them, only that Eve isn't a great match for their personality.
---
Citadels being anti-content drivers and their proliferation in general:
---
- Low power should not have a timer, damage cap, or tether. POSes were awful but at least they got this right. 
---
- You can’t defang modules or services. 
---
- Damage caps killing the role of the dread. 
---
- Timezone tanking giving an absurd edge to the defender. Bring back stront bays.
---
This would be the clearly the best. Overview too strong. You should have to look all around you 360 degrees to stay safe.
---
Bookmarks window scroll bar not saving the bar location when closing bookmarks with a hotkey. Having to minimize the window with a mouse click is infuriating.
---
Chaotic neutral
---
Honestly? That is half of what people post. Oh muh gerd c4 c5 c6 so wealthy.
---
Yes looks like base numbers is 2.25% min if I remember right.
---
Well roaming on your own in anything which isn't cloaky is absolute shit with how quick you'll be camped in or blobbed these days. 
---
And of course, if you look like bait you won't get fights.
---
Sure it is. You either had significant assets there or you were a day tripper.
---
What is the matter?  Afraid you will actually have to "hunt" for kills.  You don't want a [fair chase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_chase), you want a [canned hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canned_hunt).  Delaying intel will make it harder for the "hunters" to hunt,  but the larger and more organised groups will be largely unaffected, as they have the manpower to actually have eyes out, looking for hostiles.  
---
Delaying intel will only force the krabs into Roqs, caps, and supers, under the umbrella, even more, as they are the only things that have any chance to have help come in time to save them.  If you can't get into one of those then sucks to be you, tell us where you are, and what is tackling you before they pod you.  We will put it into our intel channel.  After that, die quietly and get Gud, because there is no hope of anyone coming to save you in time from those cloaky nulified Tengus.
---
Yeah......no
---
"I was kicking his ass... until I realized he was kicking my ass"   
---
LOL if that isn't EVE in a nutshell idk what is
---
That would be coding exceptions to a rule.
---
That's something CCP wanted to avoid after force fields, which have tons of exceptions, and made for buggy and hard to maintain code.
---
If you look closely, CCP is always striving to simplify.
---
Taxes are going to hit you regardless. Broker fees in player stations can be changed.
---
You *could* evade taxes with direct contracts but that's a bit of a hassle finding a mark, err buyer and selling it via contract.
---
It’s cause he gets a big bonus in October if game meets certain metrics
---
I stopped consistently going to provi around mid-2017. I dont know what happened but they either brought fuck-off cerbs + logi for a solo phoon, or they just docked anything within 10 jumps of my current location up. It's been like this for two years now, to the point that if Thera gets a provi hole I just straight up ignore it. 
---
The only decent fight you'll get is in the TRC pocket but even they like to bring a retarded amount of capitals when certain HTP members are online and I fly something larger than an Osprey Navy Issue.
---
I've found that if you use Q to approach a point in space the ship eventually points up after working its way back and forth approaching the point.
---
Just move your stuff back. Like we've all done for years.
---
No you're wrong because everything you stated was factually incorrect.  
---
None of those are viable for a game to last, congratz, ya killed it.
---
Maybe you should go to wow yourself since your logic is so bad, i again, never said i didnt want to lose anything, just not in the manner of dropping it out of a station afk.  
---
Actively making eve not a great match for personalities is not the same as not being a great match, in fact that's just a bad move in general...
---
more like fog of reeee
---
Gonna go with not always viable and no.
---
So is the Galmils caps we're fighting or SOLs?
---
No and no, GJ you made another post of everything being wrong again.  You're very good at that.
---
Johnny so loves Gilas 😄
---
Back when I played there was a shit ton of content around high sec wardeccing and high sec shenanigans in general. I haven't played in a long while and it seems those days are long gone
---
Well in the "elite pvper"s opinion you describe, he never said that having a metric is stupid - he only said that _your_ goon metric is stupid. 
---
And I'd tend to agree. Accumulating wealth simply requires attendance. PVE is so easy I know of people that let their prepubescent kids do rorqual mining or other forms of PVE.
---
Meanwhile pimping up your KB with (at least meaningful kills) requires much more preparation, ISK and time investment, and franky a lot more skill that F1 red crosses or spod.
---
basically you disprove your shitty goon point in your own message
---
I'd rather see tethered ships in space than occupancy counter.
---
Hyperspatial faction scram maulus navy issue my dude.
---
&gt; o and no, GJ you made another post of everything being wrong again. You're very good at that.
---
You seem very emotional. Perhaps you might go grab a coffee and a smoke of ask your wife for a handy before continuing. All you're doing no is saying "No, YOU!". That's not an argument; it's evasion.
---
Didn't see you there Vapor do you even undock?
---
.... So they need to try to be safe and successful, like in PVE?
---
Snuff's in all probability, lol
---
If you don't want to run that risk, why not just pretend citadels don't exist and dock only in an NPC station, which, aside from outposts in null sov, is basically what you would have had to do before citadels and asset safety came to be a thing?
---
The usual wisdom here is to not go through lowsec if at all possible. 
---
If you *must*, try using a DST and/or fitting warp core stabilizers.
---
No You?
---
Meanwhile ingame map for cynos has a delay, sometimes going even up to several minutes. I wouldn't mind seeing it fixed.
---
If a small entities only options are lose or get somebody else to bail them out they can't function as small entities outside of the pet realm. 
---
If this is the only play against caps it's a massive problem for alliance growth, because it means small entities can't exist under current mechanics without having some form of overlord. 
---
this say so much sad things about where eve is headed for people that don't want to sit in tidi for 12 hours.
---
And it both cases it's like this because people willingly share so much info.
---
Right, got it. The metric you choose to use is important. Everyone else, well- those metrics whatever they are... are stupid. Thanks for clearing that up.
---
:thinking:
---
If you have the capacitor for it, maybe. But most people struggle on the 200+AU warp.
---
Yeah you  caught me good Xre 👍
---
Am I the only one who thinks that there needs to be a focus on getting more people into low/null?  Is restricting information from players going to get more people to dive into null?  Seems to me the changes discussed allow for easier movement of people already in null but does nothing to actually encourage people to get the hell out of high sec.
---
The original reason for asset safety, was so that life can happen, and the citadel is not under the player's control.
---
At any time the owner can lock you out, or even unanchor.   It is a huge pita when the owner goes afk, and you don't know about it until the services go offline.
---
Does it matter if it is already replaced?
---
sure I am meatlover, sure I am
---
Catalyst is a must!     
---
Same for Machariel
---
He has the cloaked tag, those and “i’m a wormholer btw” guys only come to reddit to shit on anything that doesn’t fit their narrative
---
Lmfao imagine thinking like this
---
Well while we are at it I think the astrahus on low power shouldnt have a rf timer that thing is so cheap and a pain in the ass to get rid off even on low power, I get it for Fortizars that they get one because they are quite a bit more expensive but imo a Astrahus that is not cared for and offline should just be instantly killable. It would also help quite a lot to get rid of the citadel spam a lot easyer as a player.
---
&gt;No you're wrong because everything you stated was factually incorrect. 
---
I will readily admit the last one was just a call out to your entitlement and not really a problem to solve (well it actually is in a way) but the others are real problems and solutions that you can avail yourself of to insure the toys you really care about (and I suspect that is ALL your assets) are protected.
---
&gt;None of those are viable for a game to last, congratz, ya killed it.
---
Support that claim, please.
---
Here's the thing. I would rather see CCP shutter the game than have it devolve into a PVE haven where everything is safe from harm.
---
&gt;Maybe you should go to wow yourself since your logic is so bad, i again, never said i didnt want to lose anything, just not in the manner of dropping it out of a station afk
---
That's what you say but not how your posts read. In fact, I proposed a change in the delivery of the 15% charge that you already face, so I effectively haven't made a suggestion that eve be more risky to your wallet (given the 15% average resultant loss which is 100% predictable now).
---
Do you belong to a corp or an alliance that will defend the structure or are you living by the seat of your pants soloing structures? If the former, your structure will likely be defended so you being AFK wouldn't matter. If the latter, then you just feel entitled to keep stuff you can't defend.
---
You having a real life does not mean all your assets should ever be safe.
---
There could be some places where your assets can be safe, but there's no reason this place should be "anywhere you can dock".
---
You want action?  Leave blackout of local but Change the directional scanner to give distances on all objects including ships and enable warp to all scanned objects  including ships.  That will get you action!!!
---
So they aggro to 410 and less
---
Added systems manually. Like the good old days
---
&gt; occupancy counter.
---
Personally, I've never liked those. What's inside a citadel should be left unsaid, at least from the outside.
---
Average pilots in system, and average pilots docked, information needs to get blacked out. Its a ridiculously powerful, lazy, intel tool. 
---
The fact you can sit in a station and get an average player count for your enemies space with out undocking is ridiculous.
---
Maths is hard.
---
Yes, I did make a generalist statement. My bad that that I didn't caveat it to "a large proportion of players".
---
I figured it was implicit. My mistake there.
---
Ok - number one pet peeve. Absolutely biggest, loudest item.  
---
In game recruiting. It sucks. There needs to be a single, centralized hub that ALL new players are sorted into. A tab like agency. 
---
*   Allow insertion of pictures.  
---
*  Direct link to recruiting channels / recruiters.  
---
* List the total number of players for each corp that logged on in the last 30 days.  
---
* List total number of ships destroyed and lost in the last 30 days.   
---
However all of the other details work, I just want to have a better point of contact between those looking and those recruiting.
---
fuck me. I finally upvoted you. You nailed it.
---
Heh. You remember the crying when they were removed from wormholes?
---
Yes, any extra distance is welcome because waves spawn in different locations so they may pop &lt;410 if you are too close.
---
Then why not run Ancillary if you only need the burst rep?
---
Before blackout many of those places were heavily botted. Looking at you Period Basis, Cobalt Edge, Branch, Tenal.
---
I can completely agree with that point of view, and its hard for CCP to implement anything to hit the big groups that doesnt negatively effect smaller groups, however, i'd be interested in seeing a detailed statistical breakdown of how the changes have efffected alliances of different sizes, and outside of coalitions
---
I literally posted an argument as to why I would consider some metrics more "stupid" than others, and you act like that wasn't even in the post
---
those are also easily refutable points, i dunno man, it doesn't seem like you want to argue, just provoke reactions
---
He's too lazy and entitled.
---
im not in karma
---
XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
CCP should have made their own killboard and better maps 15 years ago then they'd have better control of this shit....
---
Side effect how eve works. You dont have a heading, if you're not moving
---
They're really not.  I already explained in above posts why im not going to do it again, you refuse to see it and you dont agree, that's fine, but you're wrong.  
---
&gt; Support that claim, please. 
---
Hmm lets make it so there is even less people in null sec in general because they cant house their stuff in space you were supposed to colonize in live in, so we essentially lesson the amount of people and conflict in null which is a big appeal to this game.  Let's also fuck people over trying to play a game where they lose their stuff from taking a break and this they dont want to come back.  Wonderful, were killing off people from null either by sending them to highsec for some "Needs more unnecessary risk (more like unnecessary logistics of moving stuff back and forth)" bullshit or they just leave the game.  
---
&gt; Here's the thing. I would rather see CCP shutter the game than have it devolve into a PVE haven where everything is safe from harm. 
---
It won't, period.  There's just a fear of that but that is not because of asset safety.  There are other mechanics that need to be solved, but asset safety is not one of them.
---
&gt; Do you belong to a corp or an alliance that will defend the structure or are you living by the seat of your pants soloing structures? If the former, your structure will likely be defended so you being AFK wouldn't matter. If the latter, then you just feel entitled to keep stuff you can't defend. 
---
I've done and am doing both.  And of course i'm entitled, I'm right ;)
---
Make titans flagships again
---
Capital Autocannon control now!
---
Long-term lore person here. You're making two mistaken assumptions here. 
---
The first is that the peoples of New Eden are well aware of preceding civilizations prior to them. The Amarrians and Minmatar reverse-engineered large portions of their technology to develop Jump Drives and Acceleration Gates respectively; pre-collapse calendars were also [explicitly used as the basis for New Eden's unified calendar system](https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/chronicles/time-the-astrologer/), even if they had no basis for where it comes from.
---
The second, I think, is that those are Earth-settler ships at all. The *only* basis we have for that is their model being used in a single video, and CCP likes to reuse their models (the original intro video used Caldari ships and stargates to represent pre-collapse human civilization. The only one time a definitively Terran ship has been recovered was when Jamyl Sarum acquired one's superweapon for use against the Elder fleet... and it still apparently provided nothing about Earth.
---
its not really batphone but if you are gunna drop neutral caps in vlill of course galmil will be there. cant leave FW and still expect FW to all blue you
---
jesus, those are some pretty low feedback numbers for the creator of a video game
---
It’s a load of crap honestly. A normal Corp site night in a C6 we will knock out 5-10 sites. I double checked a recent Corp run mail had 7 pilots make 600mil (we all run for speed and then split earnings) which takes about 3-4 hours, and then there is the time spent scanning chain before for safety and selling loot later on top, so payouts are delayed by a few days. Then you can always be rolled into by another group, which immediately means high alert. You cannot afk because an anom sig can pop up at any time. 
---
It’s worth mentioning that we run in subcaps because caps actually produce far less isk/hr, less than half.
---
Have you tried quiting EVE?   I didn’t see that on your list.
---
&gt;Was a good argument ever given towards WHY it also affects ships outside your fleet?
---
I imagine the designer saw the downsides of the modules as offensive debuffs as opposed to penalties for a buff. By itself, any of the buffs or debuffs on these things is pretty cool and very unique. The squeezing of them all together on only 4 static modules indicates that CCP used up its daily brain allotment on the previous idea.
---
Can waves spawn next to you at 410km
---
Because you bought them cheap from people who accidentally let them expire?
---
You posted a wall of text that simply broke down into: My metric is more important because I say so.
---
maybe they forgot to sell them
---
I just thought it was a bit funny to get called out for an absolutist statement, and retort with "not everyone thinks like you!"
---
Wallet divisions for individual pilots, not just corporations.  Would be nice to be able to track production job expenses vs gross income.  Always comes back to the LEGACY CODE meme whenever its brought up though.
---
I think everyone knows about high alert right now, lol.
---
You're wrong?  It is logical and reasonable to not want to do excessive logistics for no good reason in a game...
---
I mean in the sov interference you literally had like 3x our fleet in feroxes alone, and we were in kiting ships, "fight" woulda lasted like 20 seconds on that one.
---
Right? I actually was doing dmg on him..until it was too late i realized i didnt had drone overview haha
---
I actually like this idea greatly!! It would be interesting to see if it can be implemented!!!!!!
---
A man after my own heart here.  \*wipes tear from eye.\*
---
Cyno inhib buff/cyno nerf is worthless. If you limit it to a ship, that ship will be in system ready to light it. If you make capitals have to warp, then a fax will be in system ready to warp. All of these ideas are easily countered because your in their controlled space. Just get over the fact that you will have to work for large kills in controlled space. Cyno or not.
---
Because you have to based on nullsec and otherwise its unfeasible...
---
No they are at fixed locations in the site. So they fluctuate around ~50km in the horizontal plane. If you position yourself ~430km above or below the site then you shouldn't have an issue with wild variations on the vertical spawn location. 
---
[Different terran444 video](https://youtu.be/qTcvc3V0EJI?t=421) timestamped to show a spawn happening as an example.
---
Yeah respect to you guys for warping back in after the first bout. Wasn't expecting it!
---
It's clear you're unfamiliar with how this works. Use those eyes of yours, pair them with your brain, focus, and reread my comment. I didn't say anything about what any structure should be able to take on in battle.
---
That's not true, FoF is independent of targeting range. Targeting range is capped at 300km for subs anyway.
---
Normally people do this ratting by FoFing at 500-600km.
---
No, you should still be able to play casually Nullsec period, being that it is a game and having more people in  null is good not bad.
---
&gt; Hmm lets make it so there is even less people in null sec in general because they cant house their stuff in space you were supposed to colonize in live in
---
That's a logical fallacy. You can house your stuff there. There is risk involved with doing so.  You also answered a claim with another claim. You presume that null or the game will lose players because it's more risky. I've been here for a decade and the last few years the place has gotten more and more empty *in spite of* the increased level of safety.
---
Now I know that correlation isn't causation, so I won't tell you that safety has destroyed player counts but it certainly doesn't support your claim that the game will suddenly empty out because you left.
---
And I've already said that I would prefer the game to shut down than become all krabs all the time. and I crab more than half the time myself. :)
---
&gt;     I've done and am doing both. And of course i'm entitled, I'm right ;)
---
Well, yeah. I'm doing both as well and you don't hear me crying that I might lose a vagabond to the RNG gods.
---
That 6 months? or much longer on and ccp still haven't fixed fucking gate sliding, a mechanic integral to FW health.
---
Offtopic question:  Pushx is generally more expensive than red frog right?  But they use a different shipping fee model yeah?
---
Loooooooooooooooool. People have been reeeing for years about no local, supers, umbrellas and so on. They are literally still doing it. And you are sitting here taking the high road? Spinning the narrative that this isnt usual on this sub? Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
---
Get real dude. Atleast shittalk in the general vicinity of the truth man, like same zipcode or something.
---
In before we learn that the Trigs are the current empire governing Earth and its surroundings
---
Your heard it first here !
---
Haha, I remember that fleet.  It was pretty fun actually.  Except for the fact that Nour Samy decided to backseat the fleet and scream for the entirety of the fleet in command comms trying to tell me what to do.  He even called (several times in fact) for the fleet to anchor on him while I was FCing.  
---
As it turns out, that makes it pretty hard to run a decent fleet.  However, I was able to use it as a decent learning experience in order to better myself as an FC.  
---
I actually still have the AAR, you can read it here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/14rCjpVUjkl_pYhHFQHX0s-Pwq-ZDiYOZKgucuMQMXWY/edit?usp=sharing
---
It doesn't include the part about Nour Samy screaming and acting like a child--I didn't want to create unnecessary conflict in the coalition.  Skyteam took care of talking to him, or at least that's what I was told.
---
&gt; Yeah, I'm a new(ish) player,
---
1) Fuck off, newbie.  
---
2) We've seen a decade of small changes. It's just a slower pace of destroying the game. They need to be prepared to make big changes and be willing to experiment and *iterate* on changes they make. This whole "ship the feature" and never touch the fucking thing again, while it contributes to destroying the game needs to stop. It needs to fucking stop.
---
&gt; Tether as a mechanic is there as a replacement for POS forcefields.
---
Tether as a mechanic is there as a replacement for bullshit station-undock fuckfuck games. The fact that the flawed implementation of that mechanic makes it useful as a tactical tool as well is a point against it, but tethering giving the ability for defenders to undock, load grid, and get into some semblance of a formation before engaging a besieging enemy is still a significant improvement over station-undock bullshit.
---
Could come straight out of the mouth of Brisc a statement like that. Brilliant
---
Me too 😎
---
I hope your coffee has too much water. HI-YAH!
---
file your empty text file for reimbursement
---
Hey you are conflating my words again with things I did not say! GJ!
---
It is not a logical fallacy in fact and there is risk in keeping it there with the current asset safety system.  People wont be there not necessarily due to the risk but the sheer effort in playing a video game and having to constantly move stuff back and forth between npc stations and where they are supposed to be able to "live".
---
Also you're right safety doesnt correlate to causation because despite getting safer, other things have happened in the game to cause null sec to get emptier,  such as resources being concentrated in a few areas due to resource mechanics.  So ie not really because of the safety.  Now you could argue that the ease of logistics should've increased spreading out as well but the resource concentration mechanics are so well concentrated that it simply overpowers the ease of spreading out with the lack of need to.  Make no mistake I do not advocate for krabs online, but I do advocate for actually living in nullsec.  THere should be more destruction out in space doing things.
---
No but you are crying about not being able to blow things up of people not fighting back.  
---
FYI im an over 10 year vet myself.
---
&gt;People don't see the most obvious things.
---
I think it's just as likely they don't agree with you that those things matter in game. I get it. I was laid up for a few weeks last year. I won't say that I lost assets because of it but had that happened, I would have had to deal with it. If I felt salty enough, maybe I'd rage quit (I might but it wouldn't be from a loss of assets).
---
But my emotions shouldn't be the justification for making my stuff 100% safe. Especially when you do have options to keep your most prized possessions safe already.
---
So it's not that people don't see what you're trying to say. It's that they don't agree with your position.
---
20 bombers costs what, a bil or so - 20 carriers and you're at 20-25 even if shitfit.

To sum it up … we poked the bear … you guys answered … we had some nice pew pew and should leave it like that. Allways loved to fly under you in FEDUP and beeing part of it and i think i am speaking for every ex-fedup in Sons.
---
Nice narrative, using "truth" and all. Can you show me a thread where troves of "l33t" pvpers cry and bitterly proclaim to CCP that they will unsub in a desperate attempt to "get back" to CCP for screwing up their perfect tranquil game? Untrue statements like "it's really itching right now" don't really help either, if anything, the pvp community has never been more satisfied by CCPs decisions for the past years. Protip: Olmeca crying about goons in delve doesn't count.
---
I mean it seems like you PVP too, and it even seems like not all of your kills have 100+ on the KM. Is it not fun to have blackout? You're in a blue blob, the access to PVP and to PVE shouldn't have been restricted by the blackout for you. Other than bitterness and your toxic need for "revenge" after seemingly getting shafted by CCP, why do you want pvpers do go full cryhard?
---
Why would a bot need to use auto-targeting missiles? It'd just target things and press F1.
---
&gt; the sheer effort in playing a video game and having to constantly move stuff back and forth between npc stations and where they are supposed to be able to "live".
---
Well, at least you finally admitted you're too lazy to exercise your agency and move your items. Maybe you have too much stuff and not enough liquidity.
---
&gt;resources being concentrated in a few areas due to resource mechanics.
---
Resources have never been more widely available as they are now post iHUBS. We used to have a MUCH harder time getting the good ores. Literally every system in sov null is capable of having ABC rocks today. I don't think concentrated means what you think it means.
---
&gt;No but you are crying about not being able to blow things up of people not fighting back. 
---
Nope. While I do PVP as much as possible, I PVE far more often. The difference is I like the idea of risk. I don't fear change and it's actually kinda cool being kicked out of your space once in a while. Keeps you on your toes.
---
&gt;Make no mistake I do not advocate for krabs online
---
Maybe not for everyone else but you want *your* stuff to be safe from the bad guys touching you in inappropriate places.

yes, so Practically free if you're trading a lot of cheap or any expensive stuff. Anything over 120/150k would be a discount from tax and broker. It'd be a bitch, though.

Strange. I sorta remember that one but it was a level 3 or 4 mission. Is it still active? Can you screenshot the convo with the agent?
---
'Cyno detected 4.87 LY away'
---
The other way to do this would be to have some data proximity dependent.  Maybe you could see cynos light, but you would need a character within cyno range of appropriate.  
---
This goes back to how could we have some active gameplay with intel being the net result.  I think having a new skill set and maybe modules or ships expert in this, that can probe systems and abstract this kind of data. Maybe a mini game like scanning sigs with the option to block said info. All that though adds complexity thought, but could be fun.
---
"Giving the attacker the advantage" sounds pretty much like it. To me it reads as "gimp structures so attackers don't have to put in the effort to take down a strategic asset like a citadel"
---
A structure is a corporation/alliance level asset not a players ship that be welped in seconds. Why should it be easy to kill? If you want it dead then you better be willing to alarm clock for it if that killmail means so much to you.
---
Is there something I'm missing?
---
you are really embarrassing yourself
---
And, let me extend the tethering range with a rig. PLZ
---
Neither does Logi, but our heroes in Logi are loved all the same.
---
In about 10 hours sure, working atm.
---
Not played much since 2012, I see nothing has changed then.
---
Maybe in bigger stuff, but I wouldn’t know because all I use is a Hecate, so for me a unbeatable blob is just 2 t1 cruisers and some tackle. 
---
But before the blackout there were lots of stuff I could fight, plenty of solo fessors and kikis, a few t1 cruisers going by themselves, and a few dictors that had minimal backup. 
---
Now, like I said, it’s all just nothing, and then I take a gate and see a legion following me, so I have to go run to either the HTP or the Severence pocket, whichever one the t3c pilot isn’t blue to, in order to make sure I’m not being stalked.
---
I don't think they sell missiles at target. Even for hunting rats.
---
&gt;And, let me extend the tethering range with a rig. PLZ
---
I'm trying to imagine where this would be useful. Athanor cheese mining from the edge of tether?
---
You like trying to out words in other people's mouths.  Definitely didn't say too lazy to move my own stuff more like overly excessive moving which is not the same thing.  So you're wrong there, again.  As well resources are indeed more widely available but typically through the infinite mining anoms in a few systems.  In fact the sheer availability per system means you need to spread out less and are this more concentrated.  Pretty sure you're the one that doesn't know what it means.  I want everyone's stuff safe in afk? Again you putting words in and seeing what's not there.
---
Both have web sites where you can put in your ship points, freight size, value, etc.  You can compare.
---
i mean, what even is the point otherwise? you're not gonna do any damage to anyone by hitting a 800m astra in highsec, nor send a message even if sucessful, why bother. Going to their home at least sends some sort of message i guess, this just makes fedup look petty honestly.
---
lets analyse this a bit, you guys went from fucking immensea to the edge of placid, in high sec, 3(?) times, with 2 of those being uncontested bashes, to kill a 800m(?) structure. Good thing all sides mostly seem to have had fun, but if you're gonna go the t a c t i c a l  route its just pointless
---
I know that's why I asked actually...
---
Observatories.  This should be the way to counter fog of war.  They should be the easiest to blow up, weakest of all of them, but powerful tools for intel.  
---
This way you give options to alliances and a simple target to help create havoc in systems.  If a small gang can pop these in like an hour* this could cause all types of fun things.
---
*hour is a random time frame, should be a bit more but as i said should be easy to kill
---
You really should stop. Your default is attack with some “I’m smarter then you”/“your an imbecile”. When folks return fire you go more personal “I hope you don’t invest rl”/“your flipping burgers for a living”. When someone gets down in the gutter with you, it gets to hot. 
---
Go back to mining spod in delve.
---
I love that idea actually!  
---
If you light a cyno, you are opening a omnidirectional beacon of sorts.  Why not let anyone in cyno range jump to it.  
---
It opens up all kinds of interesting gameplay every time you light one.  Response fleet, the counter drop at zero, the escalation to that.  Maybe a bait cyno?
---
Maybe you want to light 10 cynos to obscure the ‘real’ one.  Who knows...
---
It would add uncertainty to a system that could be actually a bit of fun.
---
[Hi :3](https://i.imgur.com/bgIrYdS.png)
---
@everyone join mining op!
---
No, i feel that a low powered citadel should have asset safety off too, as the transportation devices that move and save your stuff are off.  So you can;t tether and your stuff is not safe, it means you have to fuel it.  The defenses should die as well,
---
Just to make sure we're on the same page, you think that nerfing cynos, the singular method with which supercapital fleets can move around entire regions faster that travel fit ceptors, will have no effect on force projection?
---
&gt; to the attacker **when it comes to the timer**.
---
I don't care how strong they are in battle, that shit doesn't matter in the least. What matters is how nearly impossible it is to take out properly timezone tanked structures. It requires no effort from the defender at all, and that's an issue. If I want to kill something that is yours, I shouldn't be fighting downtime, I should be fighting you.
---
Currently the pendulum, outside of large alliance level ops is currently swung full-bore toward the structure owner in a way that requires zero effort.
---
What's bothering me is that the most important part of any game, the new player experience, is utter shit in Eve. 
---
Back when I started Eve two years ago, we had a sort of RP tutorial, even showing your faction's navy at some point. Now you just kill Sleepers without even knowing who/what they are.
---
Absolutely! 
---
You better be fricking quick with your docking and better not bounce.  It adds a bit of risk, but not crazy amounts, to what is actually a pretty low risk point in JF work (the cyno into the station).
---
I'm sure some do
---
win is subjective, i'd say they should be able to somewhat hold grid if played correctly, even if not necessarily killing any of the capitals
---
For some of us, it is. As a wormholer who occasionally raids nullsec, I don't spend enough time in any particular area of null to know who rats where. My wormholes spit me out randomly somewhere in null, and I rely on dotlan's last hour activity report to help me decide where nearby to hunt that day. If CCP took away this capability, I would adapt, but this is how I do it now.
---
Needs better comp than comet gang...
---
&gt; Delve isn't reflective of most Eve combat situations though. 
---
and that br isn't reflective of most goons responses either, that's the response you get hitting renters nowadays.
---
&gt; Goons are notorious for dropping the kitchen sink on everything that moves
---
is this 2010? goons won't undock for home defense unless its a 60 man harpy or eagle fleet
---
That the Prospect huffs the same amount as a Venture
---
I desperately want a proper gas harvesting Expedition Frigate
---
you're literally asking if I'm showing up to something irl and calling me a pedo / insinuating I'm some felon yet I'm the one out of line? lmbo dude go somewhere else if you're gonna take internet shit seriously
---
Ita a massive bloody space station  what do you expect them to do.  The problem with citadels is they are far far too cheap hence why people think they are overpowered.
---
If a fort was 50 bill like it really should be,  then you wouldnt question its capability
---
You can play casually. There's no reason why being casual should mean you get better treatment, though.
---
First day in EVE in a slasher: dude lol I think I took a wrong turn at dodixie
---
Nullguy: yep, I'm thinking you just violated the NAP (doomsday activating)
---
all ribbing on fedup aside, they're still above those complaining about kitey bullshit and running away, please don't be an omen for the future.
---
I get f1 monkeys and hunters will get their jollies out of this idea, but as an HR/Recruiter, the zkill blackout put a pause on so many internal services that rely on it. Without being able to do an ESI pull and being able to look at zkill, we can't do our due dilligance to see if someone is an unironic spai or just a shithead bad that wouldn't fit. Plus services like SRP and many others went down because of it. 
---
Fucking with ESI will be the downfall of this game, as everyone that wrangles the cats will no longer have the tools.
---
&gt; and if EVE is a sandbox meant to correlate to reality as Hilmar says, then what your large blocks are doing it totally consistent with the settling of land seen in history. At first when single families come in and claim land, they are exposed to local and environmental dangers. As a society builds that society begins to protect its self and its individuals become "safer" to increasing degrees. But they never are truly , completely safe. The empires in eve null are not "safe" they have created a civilization.
---
I am beginning to think more and more that the people who populate the umbrella regions should play a building/farming simulator with some sort of invasion machanic thrown in once in a while.
---
You have the umbrella because of changes in the game over only the last 3-4 years of its 16 year existence.  Things were added and the player base broke them.  Things had been added before that were broken by the player base.  They were changed.  Some salt was shed.  People adapted.
---
CCP -seems- to be making changes in a different direction.  You may not like those changes.  You are welcome to adapt your empire building to the new rules and mechanics.  You are welcome to make different empires.  You are welcome to play farmville instead.   
---
No, Eve does not correlate to real life.  As complex as its ingame economy is it is NOT EVEN a pale shadow of reality.  products in real life are made from an insanely more complex variety of raw materials, often going through far more reprocessing stages than in Eve, using real logisitic limitations.  Most importantly, space in reality is limited.  If you calculated the m3 or mass being stored in Jita it likely would create its own black hole.  Space limitations are a real life factor that only ever shows up in EvE when you have to transport stuff.
---
EvE is not a civilization builder.  I can't read minds, but Hilmar seems to be saying that it was never intended that there be a safe "civilization" in Eve.  Listen to the interview and they say they want to tear down the safety the players built.
---
&gt;  you should still be able to play casually
---
And the great news is you would be able to play casually. If you work a part time job, do you expect the boss to be nicer or less demanding of your time because you're casual?
---
Domis usually derp pretty hard so you could alpha their cap with a focused void bomb
---
You spend a lot of time crying.
---
usually the heavy disruptor's go on things that wouldn't be hunting vni's. 
---
Your best bet like other's have said is the maulus navy issue. It's bonuses and ship bonuses can get you up to 5 strength from 1 faction scram, great range, also 4 low slots, can be fast as fk boi.
---
Dead Terrorists that's a name I haven't seen in years
---
So the whole "just come to our home in LS" thing doesn't make much sense after all, does it? Saucy's AAR reads a lot better than "FEDUP gets dunked on by SNUFF again," don't you think?
---
Strip citadel defence capabilities and make them external modules like pos's had so you can defang them. Go back to POS warfare but with citadels - put hard limits on the number of citadels that can be placed in one system.  Make moon mining passive again. Revert phoebe jump changes now that literally every alliance has fuck tons of supers. Supers and titans no longer hurt subcaps. Game fixed, content available.
---
Is my memory failing me Or wasnt the earth tech way ahead of what we have even now?
---
I was just stating the obvious... Anytime you bring caps out in lowsec, snuff is there to piss on the fire
---
Sorry, 
---
I meant to call you a pedo/insinuate your a felon, and say you have a small penis.
---
Things that never happened. Show me the fit where your astero can cover 100km in lets say 10 seconds.
---
you recruited me daddy (っ◔◡◔)っ
---
Congrats for these achievements theyre awesome.
---
You seem to have the drive and knowledge so why not take out npsi fleets on stream?
---
Else why not get into a newbie corp. Nothing more satisfying than teaching :)
---
I think we just hear more from the people that screech and moan, they drown out quieter more thoughtful posts.
---
Why should citadels have defences tbh. Players own citadels and they should defend them with ships in this space ship shooty shooty.
---
No. How can you power a high tech matter displacement shielding with no power? For that matter,how can you power said shielding for reinforcements.
---
No power, no tether, no reinforcement periods, no power to power the matter displacement for asset safety, no asset safety. No power should mean no power. It is derelic.

---
I quit playing after they removed duel wagers. Duel scamming was my primary source of income.
---
Hi! Hunter here.
---
&gt; Don't want local to show them 
---
Correct, although I'm pretty sure I (and many other hunters) are on record being fine with a delayed local. The part we have a problem with is that everyone's in warp back to their citadels before we get the chance to exit gate cloak.
---
&gt; but want to see how many people are ratting or mining in a system. 
---
Useful, but as I've commented elsewhere in these comments I'd be fine with CCP removing that capability. My favorite suggestion is a 24hr delay of zkill and dotlan type statistics, which is a direct nerf to my playstyle on several fronts, but again I'm fine with that.
---
&gt; roam in Lokis/covert ops ships 
---
Hah. Guilty as charged.
---
&gt; in numbers 
---
...not so much.
---
&gt; but complain about caps. 
---
If you drop 3 supercaps and a titan on my solo Loki, then... actually, I didn't complain when that happened. I did complain when Ranger Regiment dropped half a dozen caps on my brawling Hyperion, but that's a different story.
---
&gt; Only engage targets they can kill with ease, and lose their shit when someone drops ships that will kill them with ease. 
---
My guideline is that I'll engage anything I think I have a chance against. I know other hunters who will literally engage *anything* just in case it works out. Here's the thing to understand: I'd much rather be fighting your response fleet than your ratters. The response fleet is more fun to fight for me (and hey--your folks in that fleet are having more fun too). An overwhelming force of capitals and supercapitals just isn't fun to fight though. I solo roam a lot, and I've had caps dropped on me. I've also had \~70 T3Ds dropped on my head. Let me tell you, I'm just as fucked when that happens. But the latter is kinda fun (once in a while).
---
Valid what question is? Of course we want to see it survive and become great again. 
---
This was a lot of words saying nothing at all.
---
ah cool, the Liberty Squad posting has begun
---
Small POS is 10 fuel blocks an hour, medium is 20, large is 40.  I haven't run a citadel so i don’t know what service modules consume.

Doing to EVE what Muslim immigrants are doing to Norway.
---
true.
---
although.. what does "drown out" mean in this context? that there are MORE of screech-posts than thought-posts? it kinda still means that thoughtful people are in the minority..
---
OR, maybe screech-posters just post immediately when they are dissatisfied with anything ever, while normal people may keep it to themselves, resulting in, again, more REEE than normal discussion.
---
 **What is dead may** **never die, but nah we have been active constantly, just not been putting out vids and not being to active on reddit either until now. But the alliance is doing good.**
---
Upvoting a goon in AD 2019
---
But yeah. It's good that local is gone, it provided free perfect instantaneous intel, and that made it impossible to catch anything that was paying attention. The intel provided by dotlan, ESI and the in game map is not instantaneous, so it's not as bad, but it is probably too close to it to be balanced.
---
Seeing daily activity in a system or constellation to look for likely areas is fair enough. Seeing where someone is probably undocked and huntable right now is not balanced.
---
That's actually genuine mad scientist genius.
---
Would upvote but you're on 31 votes rn
---
Odd but interesting.
---
Any hunters or would-be hunters who want to network with other hunters for shop-talk or a place to flex kills; send me a message here or in-game (same name).
---
The new local has really opened up the space and I'd like to meet more people trying to figure out the meta.

---
You sound like a fucking idiot, hth.
---
Yes please make it even easier to kill bads who insist on ratting in carriers. It feeds my soul
---
Just make Concord a non Profit playable faction and let us earn those sweet skins by bashing those criminals.
---
That be perfect for finding cloaky scouts on WH’s, also it would change up evictions a bit and finding that cloaked cap waiting to safelog after things cool down
---
All this does is gives nullblobs their local back. They have enough ISK and logistics operations to fuel structures that you can't balance that by cost.
---
As someone who never played much EVE this is how I always assumed it worked.
---
Also the amount of cynos in eve means someone has to track there targets so they don;t go tot he wrong cyno.
---
Thank you for keeping the meme magic alive!
---
&gt;I want to play solo
---
Best of luck to you
---
This would be fine as long as once it is set you had to take the whole structure back down again, or at least to a final timer, to change it.
---
Otherwise offensive grid control of undocks is completely removed.
---
It's possible that the information is there burried in ancient data cores constantly reuoloaded to new technology.  Sort of like how we lose manuscripts and books by Famos people In history .... in side libraries of all places.  The information is there people just forgot that it exists or can't reference or index it and search for it.  As such who today in eve out of all the governments really cares or is concerned with sifting through billions of lifetimes worth of data to find the section that existed from earth during the colony era. It's just not a priority with the ears and race to tech and governance economies etc all taking a bigger center stage then dusty old data of a history no one cares about because it won't help them.
---
of all the things that need to be done this is what comes to mind?
---
You are right, three years ago Falcon said it’s about 106 trillion. That is a crazy number of people.
---
Others have said, but I will add my voice. Just delay the pulls. Say a 1 hour to delay to zKill and Dotlan.
---
Citadels are not a 1:1 replacement for POS's. That idea died a long time ago. Theyre outpost replacements now.
---
People have been saying this since before the game launched.
---
You are the closest thing to an expert I've seen. Where can I learn about the lore?
---
It's a inverse incentive system so the more people join the boycott the more the people that have not made a decision will benefit from breaking the boycott all you end up having is a temporary spike as people race 1 and other to market to move the cheap goods to a place there expensive. 
---
The problem is one of control of members like it's nearly impossible to check everyone for export ore or to get a justification why people are buying ore.
---
they haven't expired yet tho
---
Not bad not great 3.6/15000
---
Obligatory 'eve has sound!?'
---
The thing is the game is too safe and needs chaos. Spai prevention has gotten very good over the years, it's time to bring back the alliance take-downs and awoxing.
---
5% brokerage and sales tax. It’s fucking robbery :-(
---
How about turning it into a bit of a PvP minigame?
---
If your scanner detects a cyno that wasn't lit by your fleet, you can jump to it only after you or a fleetmate pinpoints the precise frequency and amplitude of the beacon. I don't have an idea what the process should look like, but I think it should be something that can be accomplished in about 45 seconds if nobody is monitoring their cyno. But the process of locking onto the signal would cause minute fluctuations in its pattern visible to whomever lit it.
---
So here's where the cyno scan would be opposed: If you light a cyno, you can monitor the field for any changes to its signal pattern, but nobody else in your fleet can do so for that particular field. If you think someone is attempting to lock onto your signal, you can attempt the change it to delay or prevent that from occurring. This side of the process would be all about balance. Modulate too little or too slow, and the enemy achieves their lock and can then jump in at their leisure. Too much or too quickly, however, and you risk causing too much interference and collapsing the field before it can be useful to your fleet.
---
I suppose if CCP were able to do this, and wanted to add even more potential for danger, would it be possible for them to change the way the act of jumping to a cyno field or beacon works so that if the cyno collapses mid-jump, the fleet or ship could be deposited somewhere else entirely, or perhaps even in interstellar space?
---

---
Love it, 5/7, would join.
---
And to add my complaint with citadels, there's no longer a constantly supply of abandoned POSes to kill for loot. I used to hunt around for them, and while they still exist, they are few and far in between. Used to be able to find long-forgotten POSes with either full SMAs/CHAs, or a bazillion faction POS mods that could be scooped if you had the time/accounts to AFK kill the POS.
---
Exploring for this stuff used to be a viable career path, and now it's opportunistic at best. Coupled with asset safety from citadels, it's basically a dead playstyle. Even if someone has fully abandoned a citadel, there's nothing to be gained from taking the time to kill it. 
---
We definitely need more means of "asset reclamation" from people who have long since quit the game with shit left outside of NPC stations.
---
But but but suitonia says carriers are overpowered! 🤔
---
There are about five times as many nullblob posts like this in this thread as actual posts from PVP players complaining about the idea of delaying other intel channels.
---
Something's certainly stupid.  I don't think it's the mechanic.
---
You understand that your brilliant exploit requires willingly doubling your net losses in order to maintain your ADM, right?  I suppose some entity might be combat averse enough to do that.  It sure would be fun for the attacker to watch.
---
Then people will put up more structures, that's the last thing we need.
---
What is the counter play?
---
No, your beacon is only visible to members of your Fleet.
---
It's asinine that unpowered citadel's provide tether and have reinforcement timers, for sure.
---
I would not have even logged in on a free account if my assets scattered across the galaxy evaporated because old stations were both unanchorable and destroyable.  That would have been the end of me as a potential player even though I had been unsubbed for 5 years.  No fucking way I would take what little liquid assets I had to scrape my way back to ~9 years of playing the game on and off.  Sure, I could have injected a toon into a crabbing rorqal but with no isk to buy one, where does that leave me?  Perhaps reading about the game is more fun than playing it from my perspective.  Any of my eve winning friends would look at this in the same light as me.
---
I like that idea.
---
What you're describing isn't even a thing.  The only people moving stuff through nullsec gates that aren't deep within the heart of nullbloc space are newbies and people in travelceptors (which often still die to instalock camps if they try to go through them).
---
Actual hauling in null involves JFs, warping between friendly citadels in-system, or taking jump gates that you can activate even if you're tackled.  Gatecamps do nothing to impact those whatsoever.
---
I don't fully understand how contracts work, so I just assume they are all a scam.
---
Jita has tainted me...
---
Those are some interesting concepts. I would have to say planetary warfare would be neat to engage in.
---
Actually yes, I can’t probe to save my life. Just not my skill ugh
---
This\^\^
---
The cloak Hunter cannot cloak himself?
---
that is the counter play currently cloaked ships cant be engaged in combat
---
I'll take it you're just an f1 monkey in your corp and don't have the roles or channels that deal with spais. Anyways, actual spais are extremely prevalent and even more organized than before. Just because you don't have a BoB level espionage attack happen monthly doesn't mean they aren't alive and well. 
---
If you ever used any ESI pulling service on someone that isn't yourself, you'd know that there's actually very little to go off of and the only way to actually find a spai is from sloppy mistakes they make. Stopping that altogether would just mean most established corps wouldn't recruit beyond full vouches and other services that you personally use would no longer be available. 
---
Please don't give your opinion when you obviously have no expertise.
---
&gt;I do not believe it is possible even in a worse case scenario to use double the memory just from using 64-bit
---
Tip: If you can make pointers take twice as much memory, and then you use a hell of a lot of them while disabling all mitigation because you are intentionally generating a worst-case scenario, it actually adds up to double the memory.  
---
If you need an authoritative source for 10,000 \* 64 is double the size of 10,000 \* 32, I'm gonna ask where exactly you are in your schooling.
---
&gt;Besides, the comment I replied to was not talking about worst case scenarios.
---
Golly....it's almost like there's a reason I entered the thread with phrases like "up to" and "worst case scenario" instead of that guy who thinks it's always double.
---
Newer player spotted.  IAC vs. BOB+MC days remembered.
---
"Sensor strength" on that ship could prevent it from fitting any type of cloak so could always be scanned down.
---
correct the cloak hunter woulnd not be able to fit a cloak
---
WoW is that way good sir ——&gt;
---
One week delay on kill reports and any information that can be parsed by dotlan and the like.
---
Wait what are you talking about the usability?
---
Range limit, long cycle time, large cap and fitting requirements, ship cannot use prop mod  or warp during it?
---
Cloaky ship just warps off grid
---
They still not done a purge event for a day ie no rules anywhere , citadel timers don’t exist, capitals can enter hs on that day.
---
If you can find any of the old Dev videos from before PI came out, you'll hear all sorts of discussion about the directions they were looking at taking it, like heavy industry causing pollution that would affect nearby agricultural developments, etc.    
---
Unfortunately, CCP was very much into the over-promise under-deliver school of design philosophy back then.    
---
If they decided to devote Dev cycles to that now, people would be up in arms at the waste of resources, given how many other areas of the game are still waiting on their turn for 'iteration'.
---
PI could use some love - just not right now...
---
I mean I can't.. but maybe this will help? 
---
 [https://www.eyebleach.me/kittens/](https://www.eyebleach.me/kittens/)
---
I am pretty sure who postrd it, a Rorqual hunter who is butt hurting.
---
There's a line they have to find for delayed ESI to work.   If they go too far we'll go back to the days of manually posting our kills and maintain the same problem, just with more tedium.  You know, back to the pre-zkillboard days.
---
That said, I think if we like this concept, a world without our public kill information everywhere we should just push our corp/alliances to remove the API keys from zkillboard and the like.
---
Then get out there and gather the intel first hand. Everyone is so dependent on intel automation in this game is bonkers.
---
&gt;In any ordered system, change is inevitably dangerous, and should be approached methodically and cautiously.
---
I think you hit the nail on the head and you didn't even realize it. "in any ordered system \[like a blue donut), change (like blackout, a potential asset safety nerf, rorq nerfs, tax hikes, trig ships, etc) is inevitably dangerous (more instability)". Smaller entities thrive on instability, both IRL and in game, so bringing quick, radical changes, regardless of what those changes are, is in fact good for smaller entities. 
---
And about cautious, methodical consideration of feature changes to help the little entities and new players, CCP did that. It gave us nigh unassailable Citadels. It gave us Rorquals to further supercap proliferation to the extreme. It gave us Fozziesov and jump fatigue. It gave us incursions. it gave us insane, triple redundant cyno jammers. It gave us active moon mining that created massive shortages and rising costs for the T2 market and moved miners out of anoms and into Athonor ewar range. It gave us skill injectors.
---
So lets try something new and let CCP do something crazy. Lets let them throw some shit at the wall and see what sticks.
---
Honestly, CCP needs to simply back into how many resources should flow on a monthly basis for balance then back into how long belts should take to respawn from there.
---
Forces migrant belt mining. Pushes people around and out of their comfort zones. Forces the importance of conquered space to hold resources. Provides offensive mining for those that want to leech from larger groups.
---
Some people think it’s fucked. Others disagree
---
so?
---
huh
---
Yeah but could you imagine an enemy fleet jumping to a JF cyno on the 1DQ Keepstar?
---
That would be fucking bananas.
---
I think it should be a new type of Combat recon unable to fit a cyno or a cloak . But should be combat effective
---
A rather important topic. You can tell alot about your diet/health by the color and consistency of your poop. E.g. not enough fiber, too much meat, internal bleeding, etc.
---
Combat Recon Battlecruiser? The Hunter ?
---
Say goodby to any potential returning player who may have had their assets in many baskets having all of them nuked.  I suppose asset safety during the removal of non-NPC station mechanics would have solved this entirely.  How about being able to invoke asset safety before a station gets reinforced?  Asset safety upon unanchoring an upwell structure?  Asset safety for unsubbed players?  Let's find a compromise before we go full blown retard on this.
---
Dude come on. Are you high? Cause pass me some of that shit, I wanna fly fly fly 2.
---
Seriously, sitting here saying PvPers havent reeed is a joke at best.
---
My opinions on the blackout were never fueled by selfinterest. It is bad for the game, the consequenses of it will catch up in time and by that time it might be too late to fix it. Im already seeing people leaving NS, already seeing smaller guys joining up with the blobs, seeing less content in space and so on. It is counterproductive as fk, even if it will do jack shit to me. 
---
And revenge, well speaking of it. First off, we kinda told everyone not to trust CCP but people went ahead with a total douchebag mentality of "bye bye felicia", didnt they? This is just karma man, nothing else. But still, I dont want zkill or dotlan to go away. Since Im not actually fueled by revenge and I know this change will be equally shit for the game.
---
But I also know that if it got implemented we would see weeks of reeing from pvpers about how their playstyle just got destroyed. Which would be fun, not gonna lie. But I still hope it doesnt happen since it will drive away more players, just like the blackout already has done.
---
In summary, no no and no. Maybe yes and perhaps no:)
---
Just straight up remove from game instead
---
Sounds good to me ... yes the hunter either a cruiser or BC
---
When I came back to the game I was appalled to hear about the politics. It seems like SO MANY of the big alliances have this "we will roam and fight each other with small fleets, but no sov warfare" bullshit going on.
---
Have you gotten a kill in every subcap in the game yet Tikk?
---
It’d be nice if they anchored faster too. Besides all that I do have an idea on how I think it’d be healthy for cynos to work.
---
1) They can still be fit to any ship, can still be lit anywhere.
---
2) Any ship jumping to a cyno lands on a random grid 1AU from the local star.
---
3) Profit
---
Thanks for sharing this totally new information.
---
I was running a Corp in test years ago, but yeah I'm an F1 monkey now. I know what it's like to do HR in major alliances, as I have also done that too. 
---
You should probably check up on someone before making assumptions. If I was doing hr now I'd happily take the hit if it meant more content in the game.
---
Game's too safe dude. No chaos left like there used to be. Major alliances used to be taken down from within. Alliances needed to have Intel and counter Intel. Sometimes wars were won without shooting a single round.
---
I'm aware that it brings larger risk to everyone, including my own group, but that's the price you pay for a more engaging game, and a more interesting metagame.
---
Edit: grammar
---
Eve is the only thing that has really scratched the surface for me in terms of trying to recapture that SWG spark. It’s a beautiful thing you guys got going on.
---
Why not? More stuff will die
---
&gt; I was running a Corp in test years ago
---
Then you should know better
---
&gt;I know what it's like to do HR in major alliances, as I have also done that too.
---
Hmm guess i might have to just find out myself?
---
bombers neuted you?
---
:hyperthink:
---
pls no I just spent 500m on the neon skin and can't afford to buy another
---
So basically, a radar ship.
---
Another suggestion i saw from someone was that any low power citadel that is low power for 3x months will become "abandoned" and will lose its last timer and can be shot in HS w/o concord intervention.
---
Have to disagree here. Blackout has had a positive effect on netting my group fights that we possibly wouldn't have gotten otherwise. So often I would have to hide a few extra ships/players several jumps away so as to not spook someone into over-shipping, capital escalating, or straight up not fighting us. Blackout made this more possible and worked great at that. 
---
My personal preference would be all 3 of these things. Give krabs some safety in knowing that we can't easily look at dotlan for kills. Give everyone some lack of care because zkill won't show won't you lost instantly and will be forgotten about and/or overlooked due to delay, and remove instant free intel. 
---
I think Hilmar is getting the wrong idea, or only talking to one school of thought of players if the argument is more about Dotlan/zKill than local blackout itself. Delaying zKill/Dotlan would only make nullsec even safer. Delay ESI + blackout, or nothing at all!
---
&gt;Surely there needs to be some benefit to upwells
---
Are there not already?
---
Is truth suppose to change over time?
---
Underrated comment. Needs more upvotes. 
---
It's really frustrating when some covops twat or t3d picks on our miners, and I reship from my Rorq to my fucking bling fit Garmur and they run away as soon as they smell anything but indy ships.
---
Like, why even bother coming here bro?
---
9/10 times its a wormholer too lol
---
Bots. You totally can't tell from the names though. 
---
Lybrlyrbvey is a legit name. His cousin Hdqhxqkhxoq is also a really nice person. Both hard working people and all their friends, plexing 23/7
---
Oh ye it wont be as easy as writing it out. But imo, and Im a nobody so doesnt account for much, is that all of NS should straight up boycott. I mean, its a sound strategic choice. If the blackout is to remain then NS best option is to ensure that there are no ships that can be used against us right?
---
Now in reality it wont go that way since there are smaller actors and what you presented, but ships will get more and more expensive. Mods will skyrocket and in the end, PvPers will just huddle up because they cant afford to lose stuff. And NS will still trade with eachother so outside of having to create new logistical chains it wont matter much.
---
I don't know if they just added it a couple of weeks ago or if I only noticed it then, but you can change the volume. I think it's part of a volume group though, so if you want silent D-Scan some other UI alerts get silenced as well.
---
You are both emotionally invested. I get it.
---
POSes that were offline were also loot piñatas for those who were dedicated enough to hunt for them as their primary playstyle. There was a constant churn of abandoned assets in space that could be "reclaimed" and it was awesome.
---
Go look at the history of corp hangar arrays and ship maintenance arrays on zkill. Once upon a time there were hundreds killed per month, many dropping billions of ISK in ships, mods, and blueprints. Now everything is safely secured in citadels, where you can go AFK from the game forever and the assets you abandoned can never be taken.
---
Well, this is the reason why you shouldnt have a vote. Ingame or irl:)
---
What the tether do anyways besides block all use full stuff like self destruct
---
I would constantly have a cyno up on a fully armed pos in the middle of nowhere.
---
If there were more hunters like you, that'd be great. But it seems every time some twat wants to "hunt" in South Delve, my corpmates and I always form an honest and good subcap fleet but that dude always tucks tail and runs.
---
I think people who go afk for years on end, who leave their stuff in player stations, should expect to lose their assets
---
Can you explain your thought process here? I personally don’t see why it shouldn’t work like that
---
I do know better.
---
I could be wrong, but I think he's suggesting that a tethered and logged off titan could be picked up by a station coming to meet the ships.
---
I agree. Maybe something like asset safety is only available for high powered structures?
---
&gt;You're completely ignorant to the problem with safety for krabs: isk inflation/isk faucets
---
Pretty sure bots are the main problem here. 24/7 bot rorqs and ratters did much more damage than players over the past few years. Player Rorqs/ratters dying was not uncommon before the blackout by any stretch of the imagination. Safety was never to an impermeable degree. Why CCP never bothered with a decent anti-cheat is beyond me. 
---
&gt;Hillmar, the guy with ALL the information is telling you point blank that you krabs are earning TOO much TOO easily and TOO safely. 
---
Imo a single pilot is not earning too much by regular ratting or mining. "Too much" only becomes a semi-valid point when you rat in a super or titan/ multibox rorqs. VNI/Rattle/Carrier ticks aren't that high. Running the abyss often makes you more cash.
---
Additionally, the answer to isk faucets would be isk sinks. But right now, ISK faucets just aren't worth bothering with unless you have a capital or super, thanks to the blackout. So the rich still get richer, and if you rat in a subcap, you're fucked.
---
I looked and didn't realize it was already posted? My bad, so sorry to bother you friend.
---
Because thats true. Either they have no pacts and do nothing or they have a pact and be like "oh amn we would sooooo love to do something but we can't"
---
There are some madlads out there doing the most with bombers. Like the guy in curse who hunts explo runners with a blaster nemesis.
---
You mean potential re-subscribers? How does this benefit CCP or those players?
---
Hunter hunters can detect each other too
---
What's the point of the vertical wings of a keepstar, if you can't use them like pinball paddles now and then?
---
I can already hear PGL flipping his shit, after someone bumps an entire fleet including bridge titans with a keepstar.
---
I have never built supers but as someone that has dabbled in the T3 production chain I can only agree. Very little SP required, a few bpcs and ore is all you need for capitals. I don't think they should be as complex as T2/T3 but it should be a lot harder than a T1 battleship with extra steps...
---
Just want to say I had fun!!  Pew pew pew!!  o7
---
I expect it not to be work?
---
No. No power, no tether.
---
The problem is that whatever you do know will only hurt the people catching up. And if you put in other things in the process you will just break other areas that are balanced atm. The easiest way imo is to just nerf what started it all, the Rorqual. 
---
But I honestly dont think it will stop anything, barely even slow things down. This game is old and people have amassed SP and isk. Was bound to happen at some point but the Rorq and skill injectors just put the game into hyperdrive, speeding the time up by maybe 5 years.
---
They dont need resistances to everything..... 
---
Just like 90% to capital weapons and fighters.
---
For real, building caps isn't hard it just takes a long time.
---
Supers in general are kind of dumb. I know this isn't going to be well received but personally I wouldn't cry if supers were just straight up removed from the game.
---
The mechanics are fucked, but its still a great place for small gang action.
---
Identify knowledgeable people doing what u want to do and steal their fits
---
PI is my only reliable income stream. And I am sure others feel this way. So I am kind of worried about how this will affect the little guy. As mining gets more dangerous, those with the biggest ships are more immune to attack. So if you make PI more dangerous only those who can protect their planets 24-7 will thrive.
---
This would be a good change.  When Citadels were released, the first one I put down I faced the wrong direction because i couldn't tell the difference between the front and back.   We had to do a 180 turn every time we undocked since it was aligned away from all the gates.....
---
Maybe turn Asset Safety off after a lengthy grace period, like a month of low power. Otherwise you open up exploits where someone with roles can low power and unanchor a citadel to make the loot inside pop out when that wasn't remotely possible with outposts.
---
Yes. That's the entire point.
---
You want to give less data to the defenders because if you give them too much, they will be able to counter the roaming gangs so well that the roaming gangs will just roam elsewhere.  This kills the content for the entire region. You don't a game where everyone collects resources without contest. That's boring for everyone involved.
---
Look at the sheer amount of effort that Olmeca Gold had to put in just to make a tiny dent in Delve. The guy has dozens of accounts!  That is a direct result of the defenders having too many tools that makes it easy to defend their space.
---
CCP has finally realized that these tools are killing the game and they are in the process of removing them.  As a result, subscriptions are now going up! But there are always going to be short sighted people like you complaining about it.
---
... and if a citadel has no fuel/active module, it should die on first hit. Bam! Citadel spam removed.
---
I would absolutely love it!  It would add drama to what really is a pretty low drama event....and this is coming from a guy that actually did a lot of JF work over the years.
---
He was telling me to burn in ;)
---
No its a Hunting ship for hunting thing that wish to be perfecty safe. No more saftey in EVE
---
Do you think that they would still be as proliferated as they are if they coudn't dock? And you only had poses to keep them in?
---
Lol, appreciated. TY.
---
I'm still disappointed that they missed the opportunity to replace the spinny wheel things on the side of the Erebus [with these](https://i.imgur.com/3pNRhCi.jpg)...
---
Because 90% of the time that "PvP sub cap" has a cyno fit and 15 nyx waiting to jump though. Why would anyone stay in grid for that?
---
triple rep myrms commonly are fit dual T2 and a single ancil
---
To the matter of home defense, changes proposed by the typical anti-cyno cheer squad are easily countered. They also do not take into account their effect on war.
---
He saw the writing on the wall.
---
Except for that Daredevil pilot. He seemed to know, and GTFO'ed as fast as he could and stayed that way.
---
When the guy that only ran a few fleets that nobody knows, claims the guy that everybody knew and flew with wasn't liked by anybody and nobody is allowed to point out the hypocrisy here. Perhaps he should tell you all about the little tantrum he had because strat FC wasn't handed to him on demand. You've got this little circle jerk of shit tier FCs all upset thinking they got the short end of the stick and somebody else got all the special treatment when in reality it's because they were total garbage or never did the work to earn the promotion. Nour got special treatment from leadership or Nour was 'handled by leadership.' Which was it. 'Crying like a baby.' Oh I'm sure that's an accurate portrayal of what actually happened and has nothing at all to do with someone's personal feelings because they were called dumb for being dumb. Look how many of his corpies are in here man where'd you fetch them from? FCON was very personal for you guys it seems.
---
still not sure what this fabled content created via the blackout is, all i've experienced is a drop in content. space is empty mate
---
I feel like this could lead to somewhat of a station camping effect depending on implementation. Sounds cool though.
---
People who called carebears to pvers are now crying because myrmidons are being used as bait. What a time to be alive.
---
Exactly. 
---
This is a game with players that have been playing for 10-15 years.
---
Injectors were introduced (in part) to help with the massive advantage old players have over new ones (and make a shit ton of profit). Making things harder now means that the old bitter players still have everything they complain about there being too much of. The players working towards those same things are the ones it'll hurt.
---
I also , but this is huge buff to hunting moving capitals and supers.     
---
Same for those some people are using to stage from in drone lands.     
---
NPC space in drone lands first!
---
No! HTFU!
---
(Or some other, equally stupid remark)
---
auto target missiles dont care about targeting distance which means you can rat from 380+ km away with meme cruise fits
---
Well it’s still not a cheat to have rare items .. it’s like saying I have cheated cause I have an AT ship
---
Its the best for Gurista Mazes
---
We need some kind of Fog of War to obscure Eve's glaring issues with pvp generation, that have been raised to CCP for years, like no longer being able to make a weekend timer for a fight. 
---
Oh wait nevermind, BLackout and this should cover it, ty hilmar.
---
# You took everything 
---
^walking in stations

#From me
---
Don't arm it, only equip warp disruption. Name the POS something like "You're stuck, might as well 1v1 each other lol"
---
this is what peak performance looks like
---
  Personally i would remove the mobile cyno beacon and give a new targeted script to warp disruption field generators that prevent a ship from lighting a cyno while it's being channeled but i hate the concept of deployables.   
---
  Also, maybe all the ratting carriers Ive gone up against we're shit, but with 3 or so logi a slandered carrier was never able to instantly volley an inhib and we never had trouble keeping it repped.
---
I like it...
---
Ooooh, better yet... SWAT skins for ships that can fit a covert ops cloak.
---
People who have left the game for years should not be the focus of current policies that can keep players here and interested.
---
&gt;I dont understand this. It's a massive immobile structure and you want it to be gimped vs space ships? 
---
Yes. Because a citidel is not a massive immobile structure in space. A citidel is a bunch of pixels, code, and database entries in an internet spaceship video game. 
---
Structures were added into this game as a game design decision to be an entertaining conflict generator. There needed to be a motivation for their deployment, so poses were given enhanced industry, moon mining, sov (for a time), and limited protection for assets within them. 
---
Citidels replaced POSes. They gained additional advantages, ease of use, services, and are much, much harder harder to kill. Now appearently the perception has changed, and structures should always be overpowered to the extreme and that conflict over structures should be stifled due to defensive advantages. 
---
So yes, structures should be gimped against ships, because ship vs ship combat is engaging gameplay. Ship vs structure combat really isn't.
---
Yep. Where you fuck off this game completely so the rest of us can enjoy.
---
But giving yourself RSI is a 
---
#high skill mechanic
---
(It's not)
---
alts are the bidders
---
Is this the other version of miners saying "if we all leave there will be noone to make ships for the pvpers to blow up." 
---
Adapt or die
---
I think it would help a little. Having to commit a character to that ship until it's dead is a way to keep titan/super numbers down. It makes them more difficult to use, and less appealing for those not prepared to commit a toon to that one ship.
---
What’s up with people who are bad at the game continuing to want to remove any challenge or counterplay from PvP or hunting?
---
If you want to shoot defenseless things, just shoot NPCs.
---
i have been  friends with Hdqhxqkhxoq my whole life how dare you imply he isnt real
---
I could ask you the same thing.
---
If you can't muster a fleet to reach damage cap have links and produce 5 logis to take down an astra, as a group you have other major decisions to make and it's not which citadel you need to shoot next.
---
I'm sorry, but this insult is a direct offense to my emotional state and I no longer feel safe. You'll be hearing from my lawyer, Mr. Jiuonjfghsdrgaipuo
---
The big devblog about those changes came out under his name. Now they don't do that anymore.
---
It's why people call it Fozziesov
---
space wouldn't be empty if you could hunt all the cloaked people
---
A Rorq miner would have FCd better than you. When you're so bad not even FCON wants you.
---
If your titan fleet is one particular flavor (either just armor or just shield), then utilizing the two phenomena from your own titan fleet in a major battle is insanely powerful. For example, a shield titan fleet versus and armor titan fleet gets +30% shield HP, increased resists against Amarr and Gallente doomsdays, while reducing the resists of the enemy titans against their own doomsdays.
---
but why should we go out and hunt the ducks, when we can just put the in a barrel and shoot them.
---
I agree with this. They're ridiculously slow for no real reason.
---
That would be a good option
---
CCP: Play our game, we've added a cool new gameplay feature!
---
Gamers: - What is it?
---
CCP: If you do some grinding work in-game, then some unknown people who arn't playing our game know less about you.
---
Gamers: - Wait, what?
---
One day you too shall feel uncomfortable when flying without snakes
---
It is a rite of passage
---
Get your own 15 nyx and have all out brawl. Grab Karma at reddit later from epic fight.
---
That's actually funny as hell. What noobs
---
Correct me if I'm wrong because my brain is riddled by alcohol abuse, but RFing a POS didn't take down the shield did it?  Should behave the same way as POS imo.
---
Allright thx for clearing that up! That´s a weird design choice imho.
---
just adapt and bring a dread to alpha it, we have adapted to modern eve, why cant you?
---
Great point! My corpmates and I would always have towers, SMAs, corp hangers, and POS fields on dscan so we could track down offline towers. We found billions in modules, researched blueprints, and ships (including caps) over the years. 
---
Asset safety should be revisited in the context of offline citadels at the very least; losing a percentage of assets that scales with truesec would be a nice middleground, imo.
---
Those overview settings can cause seizures.
---
Honestly there's quite a few things that need to be addressed (most of which are mentioned here), but my current pet peeve is how repetitive and boring it is to refresh daily extraction on 12 planets (108 clicks if I do it all perfectly). "Refresh all extractors" button on the planet management window ccpls.
---
Yep, can confirmed. Dunked on an elite PvPer proteus and 2 bomber alts last night with a couple of procs and a porpoise. Didn't even have to stop mining spod.
---
No a ship that uses since type of scanning equipment to track and triangulate the position of cloaked shops.
---
what cloaked people, most regions are empty bar like 3 systems per region outside of delve, unless ccp unfuck the game no amount of gimmicks are going to increase any real content.
---
&gt; We saw a surge of users come back after blackout due to the shake-up, the chaos.
---
Just because some people on reddit said they're coming back doesn't mean a surge of users came back lmafo.
---
&gt;More people died, more people active, more isk killed, and the stagnant nullsec was shaken and stirred.
---
Feelycraft.
---
&gt;More chaos means more content. Why would you be opposed to this?
---
disorganizing null alliances to the core would mean less content. You must have been a terrible leader if you aren't lying in the first place.
---
its still very fun and offers a different kind of content (where most of the time both parties in a fight want the fight) from other space + you can actually make decent isk while waiting for pvp
---
It's always been that way, the ships that were useless were probably just ones you never took notice of. It's just gotten a bit bad recently because some formerly king of the hill ships are now very outclassed when before certain ships just wallowed as garbage forever.
---
I can't wait till the DDoS module comes live. I hope they plan on giving a T2 BPO for it at the next alliance tournament....oh wait.
---
&gt;put hard limits on the number of citadels that can be placed in one system
---
So much this .....
---
Ahh, a LADAR ship?
---
Whore on a few ships to show you were there like logi does.
---
so a mix of Sansha and Mordus? 
---
god please fucking no
---
Haha idk if I'll ever be that rich. I mostly whelp shitfits in null. Maybe if I start playing in losec.
---
I'd like to be able to turn its orientation once every 30 days or something. I dropped my Azbel backwards (undock facing away from other citadels) and I can't be bothered to unanchor it to fix it.
---
Exactly
---
Kinda sounds like you're trying to make EVE safer, not less safe. If a normal ship has a cloaking device on, it's already crippling their ship and having it turned on essentially means they're not playing the game to begin with. If a covert ops or similar ship has a cloak on, it's probably because it's hunting *you*, and that's the intended role of those ships.
---
are you sure about that?  im sure you dont want my close friends https://i.imgur.com/EXjfF3t.png  and https://i.imgur.com/EPTaWGH.png paying you a visit to convince you otherwise
---
&gt; NPC space in drone lands first!
---
Remove NPC structures from null. If you want to play in the wasteland you’d better be ready to backpack or set up your own camp.
---
Depends heavily on your timezone and what your interests are.
---
If you want to roleplay capturing and defending systems for your empire, or want to take part in intense battles over system control? FW is dead. bots/farmers switch sides based  on the value of LP and completely control who is winning/losing.
---
If you want solo/small gang PVP. Can be good as long as you're playing during EU primetime or during the weekends. Later NA evenings and AU timezone almost everyone you will find to fight in the plexs are bots/farmers that will insta warpout. You can still get fights but the time commitment for each fight makes it not worth it.
---
If you want to farm missions/plexs and don't care too much about whether you get frequent PVP then FW is in a great state.
---
To alpha the inhib? He's trying to keep it alive...
---
Also a new module, probably a high slot, that can only be fitted to the Hunter-class ship, for an active sensor to uncloak the cloaky.
---
Activating this sensor module creates a beacon visible on the overview for anybody in-system to warp to right away, like a cyno. Give it a cycle time of like 30s, and it immobilizes the ship it's fitted to when active.
---
I'm sorry but still why should attackers get free intel, if the defenders don't get free intel nor should anyone else want to attack someone go there and find out if the system is in use not just look at dotlan or in game map
---
I don't have enough time to play it.
---
Can confirm, a guy and his alts tried to gank us while a buddy and I were semi-afk mining. Dunk'd them so hard he said "nice bait" in local XD

The link alone helps because now I have some stuff to read.
---
&gt;omeone that has dabbled in the T3 production chain I can only agree. Very little SP required, a few bpcs and ore is all you need for capitals. I don't think they should be as complex as T2/T3 but it should be a lot harder than a T1 battleship with extra steps...
---
What are you talking about? You can build battleship almost anywhere (including keepstar lol), it basically makes no difference. Wanna build faxes or dreads in a station that isnt rigged for them? Enjoy losing huge % of your potential profit. The main difference in building capitals is that the logistics to do so become incredibly more complicated. Especially if the system where you obtain ore is not the system where you build components and/or do the final assembly. Depending on where you do it, having a jump freighter, for example, may not be a matter of luxury, but an absolute necessity. You can build a battleship with just 1 character. Good luck having a capital construction operation without 3 or more.
---
The real complexity is not the hull but the t2 capital modules and rigs use a ton of pi and t2 parts along with t2 salvage. That is where most of the capital complexity is in construction and JF production just sucks.
---
The only thing that didn’t move is the moon schedule... yet
---
Kinda prevents blops groups from using that functionality though.
---
Crying on reddit
---
I actually really like this at bc size.
---
I hope you realize how dumb this response is lol
---
Aye, it's not hard to build them, but quite a step from battleships.
---
Takmahl were part of the Amarr empire long time ago so I don't think they predate the empires.
---
The Leviathan is a lame brick. Weapons need buff, mostly to missile connect time.

Unironically correct. The absolute state of eve.

if amar and minmatar reverse engineered their stuff, where do gallente and caldari stuff come from?
---
I lived in your POS many years ago. :D

exhibit A for why flying cloaky blaster proteus is a bad idea if you want to gank things

You wanna go buddy? I live in 2658379 Gragioujhenaghujg Road, the red house.

Right next to Huoszhaiugijov's house.
---
I may find you guys annoying when you RP, but it seems that CODE., Falcon, and myself are in agreement on this, though I *do* think that this needs to be emphasized more often by the game's tutorial. EVE would probably retain more players if they were fully aware of what they were getting into, and repeatedly hammering on this topic from the moment they log in seems like one of the most effective ways of preventing *some* of them from ragequitting.

So this is pretty much what we are talking about. A ship that is designed to essentially be an enhanced sensor suite. Give it a a module like a "Deep scan array" that pings cloaked ships. This ping can either mark the ship in space but would still leave it cloaked, making the attacker bump it or force the ship to uncloak. I imagine this ship would be a frigate or destroyer hull, low high slots, and unable to cloak. The picket ship skill would increase ping range, and reduce module duration. Now if we wanted to get really froggy, we make a Picket Cruiser that can ping to find the ship, but then gets a role bonus to lock the cloaked ship. Low high slots and small drone bay but it has decent mids so it can tackle. Thoughts in the comments.
---
I am dumb, that's why I'm here
---
How the most powerful ship in the game can teleport to any ship in the game. Without warning. Instantly. Oh and there can be hundreds of these ships.
---
I'd certainly like that. It's theoretically possible to use a jump engine without a cynosural field because that's just what the ship generating the jump corridor is locking onto, you just need to use extensive calculations to prevent yourself from exiting in interstellar space. Unfortunately for us, the Jove probably took measures to prevent that after Vak'Atioth.
---
So much has been lost. What a damn shame.
---
Fuck off, bittervet.  It's a shame that anything you might have said that might have been valid was overshadowed by you being a complete and total douchenozzle.
---
Huh, I haven't seen that before. Wonder who made those?
---
So you're saying it's complicated because you have to haul like 50k m^3 of ore lol
---
&gt; Also no additional fuel can be added to the structure once reinforced.
---
I'm not 100% certain but i think this might be the case already. I know for certain you can't remove fueld or otherwise affect the fuel bay in any way if the structure is reinforced.
---
it has 150k hp on structure, a super has trouble killing it in time... if you've been in a fleet and saw your mobile cyno get alpha it was a titan that did it from 100km
---
Do you even play Eve?
---
&gt;blaster nemesis
---
This is some next level plays, excuse me while I go PYFA that
---
I think we know also to :
---
- kill keepstar in wh
---
- Stuka ;)
---
- Boosh raven ;)
---
- kill the wreck of the MC keepstar !
---
- kill 2 titan pl in front of them keepstar 1 month ago
---
And a lots of stuff !
---
Thanks!
---
Disagree.  It's not the larger entities harmed by things like the blackouts - the larger entities can adapt and absorb the change.
---
But I think that you hit the nail on the head and didn't even realize it.  Changes were made without considering the unintended consequences.  Of course established groups and players who are really into the game (not the "everyone has to play it my way" whiners) are going to figure out the min/max of every change, and adapt to the change.  Happens in any game out there.
---
Are you familiar with the MWD cloak trick? I'm not sure it's 100% effective but should increase your chances of survival considerably.
---
Also [eve-gatecheck.space](https://eve-gatecheck.space) (was) a great resource for scouting gatecamps, less so now that Zkill is blacked out too
---
Yeah but what you described was possible, if not even easier, with POSes.
---
Feel free to elaborate as to why it is bad to fly a cloaky prot for the class.
---
I'm not a game dev to be fair, yea i can spit ball idea's but 99% of reddit's big "feature" ideas would most likely ruin the game as a whole., that encompasses mine as well.
---
How about disable ESI for free-int... killmails?
---
What's up with people who are bad at the game continuing to want no challenge or counterplay from PVP and defending their space? 
---
If you want to shoot defenseless things while at 0 risk, just shoot NPCs in highsec.
---
Depends on the total runtime of the extraction. A 12 hour duration will have 48x15min cycles, while a 24 hour duration will have 48x30min cycles
---
How is selling blue loot to NPCs not functionally the same as a bounty
---
How low have Tuskers fallen? How did you get in??!
---
A cyno inhib is not 1 shot-able by a super much less a carrier. How about you get good, learn mechanics and perhaps right click the cyno inhib and tell me again how much ehp it has.
---
 Your weakness disgusts me!
---
Damn I remember running RR battleships with you nerds back in the day.
---
Or just remove asset safety....
---
Well thats sad, i would most likely be playing during weekends, my interests is more with small fights, ive also done the nullsec/large stuff before, and i dont find it too exciting.
---
bad
---
Add to this the fact that you get a shit ton of ores as a byproduct of this new moon mining system, and high sec moons will yield null-sec ores with their goo, and it's a real problem. Inflation in EVE has run wild, meanwhile we have minerals whose prices are literally a fraction of their value three years ago.
---
It has 150k ehp not 10k. It takes supers a min to kill it. It does not take the average ratting carrier 10sec to kill it.(You can go to zkill  and check total damage done and see this easily.) Either you failed to notice the titan get cyno'd in 100k off and alpha it or you are just lying for an agenda.
---
&gt;It's understanding what's going on over the course of a few weeks or months and understanding trends.
---
Good. Lets remove killmails from the api.
---
&gt;some entity might be combat averse
---
You play this game right? You’re aware of the state of nullsec and the blocs that occupy it?
---
Please dont stop us from getting player location data though all the wormhole mapping tools will break and itll be hics all over again
---
Read the damn thing properly. it can alpha through the shield, so it will bleed structure every time no matter how much logi you bring
---
It can alpha through the shield, so it will bleed structure every time no matter how much logi you bring
---
This is the opposite of a heat sink, money that would have been dumped from the economy in Jita, Amarr etc will now be funnelled instead to the keepstar owners. So what was a money sink becomes redistribution of wealth. Ergo increased inflation.
---
How about LADAR, but using radio?
---
Probably lots of botting involved, automating some functions and they only oversee the whole process, make corrections.
---
Let it all out buddy.
---
The existence prevents fights. You have a ton of people cherry picking fights based on free intel they shouldnt have.
---
Someone is worried.
---
It can alpha through the shield/armor, so it will bleed structure every time no matter how much logi you bring

 Site 8 (nicknamed the Conflux Monolith) - The second of the Conflux probe sites, the name of this site is somewhat self-explanatory. For the first (but not the last) time in these anomalies, we run across a monolith. The monolith has a long and storied history in New Eden. One was first discovered early on in the capsuleer era near the Eve Gate. Although originally assumed to be unique, this was proven not to be the case after capsuleers gained access to Anoikis. Two Anoikis sites have monoliths, and they appear repeatedly in the Drifter hubs. The purpose of the monoliths has never been conclusively established, although clearly it shows some connection to the Sleepers, Talocan, Drifters, or all of the above. Although some capsuleers have taken it upon themselves to research and correlate what is known about them, few conclusions have been drawn. Although all roughly the same size and precise dimensions, the monolith in Dead End is black in color, while the one found here and in similar sites can more appropriately be described as silver in color, and highly reflective. The meaning or reason behind the change in coloration is, again, unknown. Part of the problem appears to be our inability to pierce the monolith with sensor scans. Indeed, the shipboard AI’s only comment on the monolith is that it is “full of stars”. Other than that, little information is available. Beyond the monolith, the second probe in Conflux can be found at this site. Why Conflux, and only Conflux, has two probes remains a mystery, but the probe is, like its brethren, nonresponsive to the normal testing protocols. A plausible theory for the existence of this second probe in Conflux is that the system may be, for whatever reason, deemed strategically important enough to warrant a backup surveillance system should one probe or the other become compromised. From an aural standpoint, no noises of unusual nature are observed.

"A super has trouble killing it in time"  
---
Ratting Hel kills it in under 30s even with no missile abilities.
---
MCI = 170,000 EHP  
---
Ratting Hel with 4x Faction DDA, 3x FSU, 3x Ametat II / 2x Templar II with turret abilities only = 6180 DPS.   
---
Ratting Hel with 4x Faction DDA, 3x FSU, 3x Ametat II / 2x Templar II with turret + missile abilities = 7177 DPS.   
---
All of this fully applies to the MCI because it has a sig of 400m. 
---
170,000 / 6180 = 27.5 seconds time to kill with no missile abilities.   
---
170,000 / 7177 = 23.6 seconds time to kill with missile abilities.
---
Cool, you still used insults more appropriate for five year olds. Congrats.
---
&gt;When I look up a toon on zkill I'm looking at the first couple pages even if that goes back 3 years, not what they did 20 minutes ago. So delayed killmails achieves almost nothing from that perspective.
---
Why do you think you should be able to access that info?
---
This isn't too difficult though, since fleet cyno's are clearly marked as a fleet cyno. Not that it's impossible to click the wrong thing, but it's not very difficult to simply pay attention before clicking. :P
---
Bring some ECM which has non-0 resistance, problem solved
---
bombers eat caps, harpies eat bombers, vnis eat harpies, so on and so forth up the chain.
---
I'm talking about the fact that I personally killed 2 dreads (you know, those high DPS capital ships built for bashing structures) and my CEO killed another 2 caps. Totally unsupported by friendlies. In a Fort in a region we had entirely abandoned. So structure dread brawls are dead.
---
I'm talking about timers that can't be kited, can be set the same as all structures that you own, and that only have a 2 hour fuzz factor. 
---
Oh, yeah did I mention that there were 3 separate bashes required for a 500 mil isk structure? Pretty retarded right?
---
I'm talking about the infinite number of structures allowed per system.  I'm talking about the fact that low power astras that still have a damage cap, still have teather, still have active (21000 dps) weapons and utilities, and still have asset safety (so even if you do kill a structure that is not fueled, the defenders still don't lose anything but the structure itself). 
---
I'm talking abou the lack of incapable defenses. 
---
I'm talking about the lack of disruptable services for small gang content. Like on Outposts.
---
I'm talking about the fact that of your 5 logi, only 2 of them will actually be repping because cits can permajam the other 3 out of the fight. So you need to bring 8 logis to get 5 working ones for the subcap fight that we ultimately want out of a conflict generator. Well I'd love a dread brawl (now that I have a dread), but I've already established that those can't happen anymore.
---
I'm talking about the fact that bringing more than 3 lesheks to bash an astra is a waste, because no matter how many ships you bring, you won't get the job done any faster. 
---
Citidels are amazing to use, but they are fucking horrible conflict generators relative to poses.
---
EDIT: People apparently can´t read or understand properly:
---
carrier fighters **can alpha through shield/armor**, thus rendering your logi useless. The inhib will always bleed structure HP.
---
They obviosuly cant alpha the whole thing, jesus christ
---
What if dreadnoughts could ignore the damage cap?
---
It’s mostly there because otherwise a fleet of 250 titans/supers could kill a structure while being repped by FAX’s and effectively being unstoppable.  If a fleet of 250 dreads come in, the dreads cannot be repped by FAX’s while sieged.  The dreads could be killed.
---
TL;DR  Give dreads a role bonus: ignores damage cap while in siege mode.
---
My kingdom for an Angel carrier!
---
Also, AFK Drone Domi could sport some nasty scram range, just sayin'.
---
What is this mini-eve-windows-thingie there on the right? I need that!
---
I find this whole idea hilarious mostly because it's not the first time it's tried and it always fails, you would need absolute loyalty from everyone with access to your market, this is currently absolutely not the case (you recruited people based on the isk printing facilities) and now you ask those very same people to take a 50% hit on profits for the good of all of nullsec. 
---
Most likely supplying the people not loyal to corp / alliance / coalition / nullsec with all the money as there the once exporting the goods still ( they don't give a shit they want isk ). 
---
like the more you break down this scheme the silly it becomes, unless the goal is to create enemies and provide them with a solid income source ( with realistically at this point could be the GSF battle plan without admitting it to line members because they fair the stagnation they created ).
---
DARKNESS flair calling other people bad. Checks out.
---
You call people bad yet you drop 5 caps on two roaming frigates regularly. Wake up, will you?
---
I'm about to start dumping quafe into the harbour.
---
you are the pro elite 
---
its imposible to alpha a cyno inhib in a carrier. do not expect to 1v1 a carrier in your cruiser. Just u know stop sucking
---
Idk what is up, but like 90 percent of the people don´t seem to have understood the topic.
---
&gt; You think just because I fly capitals that I don’t know how it is to be on the other end of cap fleets ?
---
no i think that instead you don't care.
---
&gt;I suggest skill up like the rest of us that fly cap
---
Sure i'll take 15 injectors and put em all in cap skills if you are payin. Just like everyone else gets into caps right?
---
The sequence goes red -&gt; yellow -&gt; green, I think the answer is obvious.
---
can we now get our own tag in this subbreddit ?
---
How about the gamma spectrum?
---
We could use a gadar
---
Show us on the doll where the manticore touched you.
---
But you could have put stuff in outposts and outposts don't exist anymore. So if you live in like Cobalt edge or some place like that and needed to AFK for a long duration, you put your stuff in an outpost with a freighter. When you came back all your stuff was still in the outpost, even if the outpost changed hands. If you lost docking rights you contact CCP support and they will move 1 ship (your freighter) into a lowsec station.
---
... I want someone to realign a structure so when you undock, your ship comes out upside down.
---
&gt; It can be a bit of a stretch, but the general idea that given a complex enough society, enough time, and people being people, its not hard to imagine history and records constantly being lost. Especially in a scenario like EVE where there was an initial catastrophic event that threw everyone back into the industrial age.
---
Personally, I'm most impressed that baseball caps and aviator sunglasses have survived 20,000+ years into the future.
---
Go read Empires of EVE ([https://www.empiresofeve.com/](https://www.empiresofeve.com/)). This is the way Eve always has been. It is certainly the way the game was being played when I first started 5 years go. I don't think there is any mechanics change that could make it different.
---
Diplomacy is one of many required skills to grow your group in Eve.
---
I’m kinda excited by how quickly they’re moving now, if they keep this up, and it sounds like they plan to, we might have some excitement again.  I’m willing to give them a chance.
---
See CCP!
---
The problem isnt just KMs. The problem is also CCP automating the availability of them.
---
&gt; my corpmates and I 
---
&gt; that dude 
---
FYI: this is why they run. For what it's worth, it takes us time to form a proper fleet too, so if you stick around the dude may come back with some friends and have a brawl with you.
---
Yea, but also
---
This is new eden, do you want to go deaf from the constant detect tone?  Cause thats how you go deaf from the constant detect tone.
---
The accelerator expires at downtime on Aug 1 and is no longer consumable after that. The auction ends several days after the item has expired.
---
he's not implying that you can alpha the entire thing off grid, he's pointing out that it's not that hard to alpha through shield and armor, and deal damage to the hull, with each volley no matter how many ships you have on the inhib. Unless you're the one person in eve with a hull remote repair bonused ship, you can't effectively restore the hull that's being damaged on each volley.
---
Do I need to break this down any further for you?
---
Its strange, though, since both were set to 25 hours, yet they had different times.
---
I dislike this idea.
---
Instead, how about we get a T2 Cyno with a 30km radius instead of the T1’s 5km radius?
---
You know that below the first youtube tutorial video is a link that gives you a bonus when you sign up to Eve?
---
As healthy as solo 1v1 bs fights
---
Its some bad troll or a completely braindead knob.  
---
No point replying.
---
Eve-o-Preview.  
---
Pretty handy little bugger for multiple client operations.
---
Are you that group of noobs that keep crashing moon rocks that you don't own and have been asked to leave alone??
---
nope, should be same as pos's
---
CCP removes npc faction stations
---
Can we please include "number of ppl active in system in the last 30 min" like a real fog of war
---
one of the largest eve battles ever was caused by a miss click.. so it can cause some fun stuff
---
This is why remote hull reps are so good /s
---
In fairness, they do know of the 'Terrans' but it's considered much like we would consider Atlantis today - a myth much embellished over the millennia.
---
&gt;You going to sit here and deny that you where not discriminatory?
---
Indeed. I was not discriminatory. 
---
I asked a question about how you concluded something about a person. I then said you displayed an impressive fete of mental-gymnastics.
---
I am pretty sure rorquals do not have fighters.
---
If you find blobbing one solo pvper/small gang with 100 ramjags an interesting pvp experience then its the right place for you.
---
Same reason you roam Provi?
---
Hilmar woken up from deep freeze?
---
Now pls, s unfuck citadels and sov.
---
Ease!
---
Well...I mean....Goonswarm flair
---
The Gallente and Caldari found only fragments of pre-collapse technology - not the complete, intact examples the Amarr and Minmatar were lucky to encounter. Ultimately, they were able to use those as partial hints at the right direction to research but carried out the actual R&amp;D on their own.
---
Man, back in the POS landlord days. What a nightmare to manage fuel costs!
---
I was actually playing around with this idea of having a new module type to hunt down cloakers. 
---
This module would act like a bubble. Once activated it will shoot out a bubble reaching up to 20-35KM, any cloaked ships within would lose cloak for 2 seconds before auto cloaks back, which then after 10s cloak ship loses cloak completely (as if the user disabled cloak, countdown timer starts as soon as the 10s are up in order to recloak). You can think of this as a large energy wave that disrupts cloaking abilities. Higher meta cloakers allow for a longer time before completely losing cloak. This would also give the cloaker time to react, via getting off grid or pre-pairing to fight. Bubble does not last and should disappear after 10s.
---
The new module should have a decent reactivation time in order to prevent spam while also taking 90+% of the ships cap, only 1 can be fitted to a ship. 
---
This is just something I have been thinking while at work and is probably stupid.
---
Corporation tax is income tax, and just be thankful CCP doesn’t require you to fill out an empire tax form every year based on your income to make sure you have paid enough. They will come out with an Alternative Minimum Tax for the 1%ers
---
They are all generally considered precursors. Lore nitpicking has better options than this sub.
---
&gt;Cloaky ship just warps off grid
---
Can just punt sabres at it using fleet warp.
---
&gt; What's up with people who are bad at the game continuing to want no challenge or counterplay from PVP
---
Yeah sorry that’s not what this is about. &lt;3 you bruv but honestly if the real issue with “defending their space” is that hunters need more handicaps then they aren’t good. There’s plenty of hunters who were thriving before blackout and the big issue with blackout currently is people not being in space enough.
---
It is the initial set up of the infrastructure to do so azbel rigged at least with t1 capital construction rigs to build anything bigger than an orca and a sotyou for super caps to make it in anyway efficient to do so. Ore is a problem. Do you move it in compressed blocks or as minerals? Do you have max refining skills and a well rigged tatara to reprocess the material or do you need to get someone else to refine them for you? Do you have your capital component bpos at 10/20 and your ship bpo at least at 7 ME? Do you have enough industry slots to build multiple simultaneous runs of each component needed to build the ship? How long are your slots going to be locked up for to build these items and ships?Do you have a good place to make  these copies? How are the build costs for everything and the taxes on the refining? How about jump fuel costs for moving the capital to alliance staging system to better get it to sell? If you are seriously building capitals as an industry instead of as a hobby for yourself.
---
If it's not broke...
---
&gt; vanguard incursions its possible to add all fleet members to a single watch list.
---
Also doable without logi, just bastion marauders.
---
Personally i think mobile cyno inhibs remain the same should be removed all together there should be a module for blackops that would generate something like an EMP pulse . That disables all navigation modules in an area for 120 seconds . This includes cynos and active cynos will go into cooldown instead of staying on . But this will also mean even the blops cant jump out and they will have advantage of staying cloaked after they kill their target or escape if something unfortunate happens .
---
There are three places I suggest if you want to learn more:
---
- The [Fiction Portal](https://fiction.eveonline.com/) is CCP's present gateway to all things lore. However, it is still in development - things being rolled out bit-by-bit.
---
- The [Backstage Lore Wiki](http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=Main_Page) is a mirrored copy of the CCP's old Eve Wiki before they shut it down. Note that some player-created fiction is stored there as well, but is marked as such.
---
- Lastly, the [Roleplay is Primary](https://discord.gg/fUJRaAf) discord server. Even if you don't like roleplay yourself, there's a good overlap between "lore nerds" and "roleplayers", and many of them will be happy to answer your questions.
---
No I am absolutely against skill injectors, there the cause of the current state eve is in.
---
I have never used one and pride myself for not doing so!
---
It's not just some people on Reddit, there have been posted numbers to back this up.
---
It's not feely craft it's fact.
---
And we're not talking about disorganization here we're talking about a bit more of a fog of war when it comes to ESI. This could come in many forms and doesn't necessarily mean that these checks would be removed, but maybe delayed. Might need to check a bit further to find the same content you would normally find in seconds. Optimally this would mean you can still find suspicious activity, but maybe lack a smoking gun. 
---
You also have to realize these delays would also make it harder for hunters, and small gang. Delays on killmails and npc kill information also makes it harder to pinpoint targets. 
---
Take out the pocket protector and the need glasses off for a moment and see the bigger picture, paper pusher.
---
They should have to sacrifice a newbie, too. Just stick them in their favorite frigate, blow them up, then haze them until they cry and quit the game.
---
They are also found in drone... hierarchys i think... as a trigger for the sentient spawn
---
&gt;Would diversifying the supply chain not at least somewhat reduce the speed at which they are being built?
---
Wouldn't matter to a 20,000-man alliance permitted infinite alts.
---
If the required minerals were in Cobalt Edge, it would at least make things interesting for a minute...
---
Thanks, I understand where you are coming from, I see it as a player problem where the majority of so called pvpers go after the easy gank target. I always joined in on my alliances ops where time permitted. Here is my killboard https://zkillboard.com/character/94708327/ as an example. I don't give a shit about killboards honestly, this just proves that I did engage in pvp.
---
Take that how you want,  whilst I spent a lot of time krabbing because I enjoyed it, it's a valid play style because the mechanics are there for it. In my opinion, more pvpers like yourself just need to go out and fight regardless of the outcome.  Unfortunately, thr majority of posts on reddit are people reeing about hunting krabs. The players did this themselves and have nobody to blame but themselves.
---
Nah, we have our own moons on that matter. And thanks, been thinking about stage 13 cancer but couldn't find it on the new eden store
---
Question: How do you filter by rating? I remember that being a thing fitting sites used to have before I came back so you can see what the latest meta is for fits, as voted by players etc.
---
Interesting. Never heard of Georgist policy. I stopped after a few Econ classes. (I switch majors it Computer Science, it was a good decision) :P 
---
It's kind of tricky applying these economic theories directly to Eve, since there isn't a 1:1 correlation between Eve and real life. Also, no one takes any economic theory and applies it without modification. But I definitely see a strong Georgist policy in how GSF manages things.
---
Just shoot the fighters, they don't have a lot of EHP.
---
List expensive items in public contracts for 0 isk and the PLEX equivalent of the price you want.
---
description: PM for private ISK contract
---
The simple fact is ..its far too easy far too quick and far too cheap to build caps especially supers and titans 
---
There should be extra special materials or  minerals are hard to find or get.they should take a long time to build and they should be expensive
---
The Gallente and the Caldari as part of the Federation also reverse-engineered jump gate technology based on the surviving fragments of ancient jump gate ruins they found in their home system of Luminaire.
---
Together, they also developed the Sotiyo-Urbaata Drive, the very first warp drive in the history of New Eden.
---
I feel like this is an alliance issue and not a CCP issue though
---
&gt; DARKNESS flair calling other people bad. Checks out.
---
Flairbaiting is a time honored tradition of my people. Also, someone thinking flair is meaningful on r/EVE in TYOOL2019. Wew.
---
&gt; You call people bad yet you drop 5 caps on two roaming frigates regularly. Wake up, will you?
---
Darkness regularly gets their shit kicked in by hunters and roamers. Them dropping five caps on anything is an opportunity that apparently you’re just not good enough to capitalize on. Maybe talk to your group about ways you could make dropping caps on you less appealing or work on your counter plays like better traps with inhibs already in space and anchored.
---
&gt; Also, shooting defenseless things? Since when are caps defenseless?
---
Nice! So you agree caps and supercaps should be able to apply to sub capital ships. Glad we have that in common.
---
&gt; Also again "counterplay"? Pressing a magic button and instantly teleporting 20 ships on top of someone is "counterplay"?
---
Amazing. You know it will happen but can’t figure out how to handle it. Do you also touch stove tops and lick sockets? If you know something is going to happen and can’t actually make any advantages out of it then that’s a problem with you, not them.
---
Tailoring the game to make your hunting zero risk even when your target dies everything right is not making EVE less safe. It just means you want to shoot NPCs that show up on your killboard.
---
Business decisions that actively punish returning players like this will have those people continue to be not part of the game instead of potential future subscribers.
---
I dunno. Do you?
---
Changing a ship meta is not the same as having to or deciding to leave the game for a few years only to find things that you thought were secure were now space dust because of a gameplay mechanics change that you weren't aware of because you weren't playing.
---
Put this another way, would you be so enthusiastic about this if asset decay was a thing in highsec?  Don't log in for awhile?  Oops all your stuff is gone permanently.  Sorry you weren't reading the patch notes for a game you hadn't played in three years.
---
You have obviously missread the post to support your agenda.

I 'was' cap stable running armor hardeners, but not with armor rep running. Add a cap drain and it goes down pretty fast, remember, I still had a full load of rats that just spawned and my sentries aren't hitting the bomber. If you don't have back up near you, you are dead.
---
Its kind of like why entosis was removed from interceptors and nerfed for everything else. 
---
Presumably it has the effect of raising the minimum power of the attacking force. If I know a structure has zero defenses, I'm going to find the easiest and safest way to kill it. If a structure has defenses, then I need to bring something more robust but likely less able to run and hide. 
---
Whether or not it raises that bar too high or too low is up for debate.
---
Bombers aren't 1v1'ing caps.
---
Then bring a lif and rep it. Or jam the fighters. Or defang the super with a carrier.
---
Perhaps something akin to how stealth tech works IRL.
---
I'm no expert but as I understand it, stealth aircraft work by reflecting the Radar waves away from themselves in a direction other than back to where they came from.
---
In theory, a way to counter this would be to have numerous aircraft with Radar receivers on them orbiting an engagement to receive the deflected Radar waves.
---
Again I'm no scientist so apologies if what I've said is total bollocks.
---
Could work in Eve where these hunter ships (or you could add a new T3 subsystem) with their tracking high slot module lurk in a system detecting some kind of unique radiation emitted by cloaking devices ... Would it be too OP for these to not appear on dscan also?
---
The thing that can hurt the established players more than those who are catching up is to Nerf the ships. Reducing the power of the ships disproportionately reduces the power of those who have the most of them, because they have retroactively wasted the most time and resources. And it means that people who are not in a position to already own them can make a more informed decision about their construction and Fielding.
---
adapt or die, this isnt 2010, your kestral cant solo a inhib
---
Or we could just turn off asset safety.
---
Nasty combination of autism and narcissism
---
I couldn't agree more.  If it's Eve's intent to alter our game play, they have succeeded.  
---
I, for one, will rat in my carrier.  I'm a sitting duck for any fleet who wants a carrier kill.  There is little I can do to defend myself now.  
---
I cannot do anomalies, I have had a couple of visitors scan me down then come out to visit me and my 1.75 bil isk battleship. I have gotten away luckily. 
---
Now I only mine in large fleets (safety in numbers).  But those are very few.
---
So what I do now is collect 10-25k free skill points of which Eve gives out like candy.  That lasts me at most 5 minutes
---
On the upside, my guildies in Guild Wars 2 are happy that I am playing GW a lot more now.
---
This game is no longer fun.
---
One would assume that a capital ship would be more complex of a build than a Hawk.
---
&gt; It's not just some people on Reddit, there have been posted numbers to back this up.
---
The closest info we got was a CCP member saying that "even accounting the people logging in for the login rewards, there has been more activity", skirting around the fact that the latest even requires login activity to even get them. Anyone who knows how error analysis works will quickly realize they tainted their login numbers by loading the last few days with so many events. Even if they "accounted" those people, player intention is what key here. 
---
&gt;It's not feely craft it's fact.
---
Citation, please. There has been no overwhelming report that more shit has died in the last 2.5 weeks than a usual summer 2.5 weeks. In fact, it might be the opposite.
---
&gt; Optimally this would mean you can still find suspicious activity, but maybe lack a smoking gun.
---
You see, now I definitely know you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
---
It's extremely obvious that you're just some random f1 monkey so this conversation is over.
---
Drifters are not ancient. They're a very new faction that was born from the Sleeper VR Construct, comprised of AI infomorphs (called the *Others*) that spawned during the Construct's long existence.
---
Holy shit you're dense if you think finding the nearest azbel in *insert umbrella region here* is difficult.
---
I thought dotlan updated every hour? How does that affect anything? And zkill pretty much shows you info after the carnage. I don't get it. Are you saying both of these contribute too much assistance?
---
I like the number 10.
---
Taxes and rigs are the mark of them. Depends on the corp who owns them and what they set up.
---
Reduce amout of ships tht can jump to a cyno. Either via lo consumption or unstability cause by 'insert lore'
---
Oh my god taxes! Golly gosh what a bottleneck.
---
Low power were introduced 13th of february 2018. So no, people have not been saying this since 2016.
---
Do we also need a daemon hunter to channel the ancient energy?
---
I am aware. Trying to keep it simple here bro.
---
I would add to this, that any defensive modules should deactivate when a structure goes low power
---
&gt;What we need is for cyno inhibs to cover the entire solar system or at least maybe 15 AU, and for the inhib to half the time of an active cyno.
---
For any semblance of balance to exist with this change, they would have to be consistent with other things that apply a non-localized effect and be visible (and warpable) on the Overview system-wide.
---
I'd be fine with this.
---
You misunderstood me. There is no "safe", it's an illusion you parents sold you like 🎅. You, right now arguing with me, could at any moment have someone murder you. Maybe society will avenge you, but your dead.
---
In this game death is temporary, an inconvenience. The coalitions have militia. You can call them umbrellas or whatever to minimize it but that's what they are. Eve is a civilization builder. The tools are in game, available to all. If that's not how you choose to play that's fine. Sociopaths do not need friends. I digress.
---
The militia regions are not "safe" that is hyperbole. They are constantly under attack by threats big and small. You and others only claim safety so you can ask for further advantage. This echo chamber of a forum has only encouraged people to believe the exaggeration to be fact.
---
Well if this is true need to make sure we have soul stones in our cargo to active it initially.  
---
Btw wow classic launches soon
---
So, it's like there were 50 times the posts telling null to get gud eh?
---
Are you retarded? If my production costs are over my value of net sale for them why produce them? You are competing against the corps who own those structures who can take 10% off their total costs compared to you.
---
It’s designed to mimic a POS. A POS’s shields didn’t go down just because you reinforced it
---
It's not CCP who's sharing that info with me. For any given killmail there's only 4 people who make it end up on zkill:
---
* the killer
---
* the loser
---
* either of their corp CEOs
---
One of them has made a conscious choice to share those killmails with us.
---
It should for sure be warpable.
---
Also, I thought structure spam was a bad thing. But doing this means you need a huge increase in the number of structures per region
---
Or some ones corpse lol
---
If capitals are so cheap that building them is unprofitable maybe it's not that complicated then? Seems like there isn't any major bottleneck.
---
&gt;&gt;I do not believe it is possible even in a worse case scenario to use double the memory just from using 64-bit
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Tip: If you can make pointers take twice as much memory, and then you use a hell of a lot of them while disabling all mitigation because you are intentionally generating a worst-case scenario, it actually adds up to double the memory.  
---
If you made a program that is nothing but pointers, I guess. Is that even a program in any meaningful way?
---
&gt;Golly....it's almost like there's a reason I entered the thread with phrases like "up to" and "worst case scenario" instead of that guy who thinks it's always double.
---
Because you have to be "that guy"?
---
So the main problem I have a putting this on a ship is that the ship has such an narrow use that flying it would be extremely boring. It also means that whatever limitations you put on its ability can basically be taken away by just throwing more alts into more copies of this ship.
---
This is the kind of thing where an observatory would be a lot better. You can make it so that only one Observatory can be anchored in each system, and then put some kind of cool down on the ability so they can't be spammed.
---
Then what I would suggest is some kind of pulse that is targeted with probes. You fire the pulse, and the location of all ships that are cloaked in that area I revealed for something like 10 seconds. This would mean that in order to take advantage of this information, you would also need to be on grid with the pulse, and that you would still have to manually attempt to decloak whatever is there.
---
It also means that if you guess incorrectly you won't see anything, and you will have to wait for the long cool down to try again.
---
You could use the scanner probe interface to also create a dynamic where you have options. For instance, maybe you can hang a really wide-area of 16 AU, but ships will only stay revealed for one second. But if you use a really narrow and precise hit, ships could stay revealed for longer.
---
This kind of implementation would avoid spam abuse while also making the gameplay somewhat interesting. It would help counter completely AFK 24/7 camping, but could be avoided relatively easily buy anyone who is actually at the keyboards or has done a good enough job positioning themselves where you would not guess they are. It also makes this ability purely defensive in nature, requiring you to set up the structure in advance. Ideally this would be a relatively weak Flex structure.
---
Come on, you can do better than that. Just because you have no logical basis for your argument doesn't mean you can't put more effort into it; plenty of other "you're wrong because I want you to be wrong" replies put way more effort into it than yours.
---
If they were honestly looking for data, they wouldn't have deliberately introduced a huge confounding variable like that.
---
So I'll put in this way. When I first moved to null with a rorq and 2 hulks I mined enough to build multiple dreads in a short period. That's single rorq and 2 hulks. Now were at the scale I am now and I can mine enough for titans or produce dreads an hour almost. It's the lack of mineral cost vs the ability to acquire materials. Were past the point of reducing how much rorq mines and need to increase the minerals needed or change what mineral comes from what ore
---
you complain like a little girl, back in my day tuskers were real men!
---
How do small groups plan to use supers then? Safespots?
---
Caps shouldn't be able to 1v1 a bomber either it should be a stalemate with the single bomber unable to overcome the tank of the cap and the cap unable to hit the bomber at all.
---
Would not improving cyno inhibs *add* challenge to the defenders and improve counterplay options for the attackers? 
---
Also, I'd like to point out that if you can shoot NPCs, by definition you are not defenseless.
---
Laffer Curve, my dude. Cutting taxes doesn't always solve everything but it's not always an illegitimate solution either.
---
In your own post you say it makes fights happen. So no, it doesn't prevent anything.
---
Except valkyries going that fast won’t apply shit to interceptors, with drone MWD cycles and Valkyrie tracking they’ll be slingshotting themselves around and missing
---
I think at this point CCP should worry about keeping people here, and keeping BRAND NEW pilots here.
---
People who have been gone for that long, have no leg to stand on, when they leave their assets in the hands of a citadel that can be pulled down.
---
The point is that the Drifters don't predate the four empires of New Eden.
---
20 USD/month VPS on Digital Ocean will do for 50 to 250 accounts
---
Oh, but that's an easy solution to implement, right? Just a few hours of writing code and you're done, whip it up in a jiffy! It's easy to conceptualize so it must be easy to implement, right? Isn't that how code works?
---
^(I'm not bitter, I swear.)
---
It only helps gankers. You can literally have 100 recon ships flying around cloaked fall day long looking for the perfect kill with no defense against it. They can strike and recloak and never be found. At least with local you can tell something is happening. It helps prevent ganks but means people that want to fight can come do it. As the Goon said, lack of local just moves people to more tanky big things.
---
For the sake of restoring my faith in humanity, please tell me you are joking.
---
You dont need everyone to tow the line. Like ever.
---
DAU and MAU measures unique logins not concurrent player count.
---
Nerfing ships beyond reasonable amounts means the death of them, pure and simple. And doing so to titans means the game will never even regain players trust in those items.
---
blaster + slow fat ass = point blank range and no realistic chance to disengage when things go south
---
This is the best idea ever. From a lore perspective also -- what manner of space magic made cynos "only for" certain people anyways? It makes no sense.
---
Rockets are what I use for that, but it’s a very simple fit. 
---
Highs are dps, probes, and cloak. Mods are dual scram, sebo (scanres for initial tackle, then switch to eccm), and AB (mwd if you’re worried about getting past gatecamps), lows are damage control and a dps mod. Rigs are hull buffer.
---
I think more people are leaning toward T3 cruisers for everything. They can hunt, explore, rat, and even have loads of fitting options.
---
Thays sorta the hope, pvp was my preferred activity in the past
---
Poof, I've gone back in time and made excavators go away by removing local. We Miner II now.
---
Why not just make them invulnerable.
---
yes me too
---
&gt; Would not improving cyno inhibs add challenge to the defenders and improve counterplay options for the attackers?
---
Why should the defenders bear the burden of the challenge? If you want an easy kill, shoot NPCs. They even have loot and pay out bounties. I’m certain that’ll be more your speed.
---
&gt; Also, I'd like to point out that if you can shoot NPCs, by definition you are not defenseless.
---
And I’d like to point out that:
---
1.) the same people who want these inhib changes typically also want carriers to not apply to subcaps.
---
2.) If you think that NPCs aren’t defenseless just because they shout back (since as you say someone who can shoot isn’t defenseless) then maybe the issue is that you’re really *quite* bad at EVE.
---
thanks :D
---
I see you dont u understand how alpha works. 20k HP in shield armor with 0% resists vs 200k alpha. Who will win?
---
How do you play this game?
---
That is what I envisioned when citadels were in concept and being discussed
---
Dictors / Hictors get special ammo / script that scramble any lit cyno within the bubble?  
---
Make the dictor versions take up a large amount of m3 so that they can only load 1 or 2 per reload.  
---
/bitter
---
Give the BLOPS Jump portal generator a script that does something similar? But that would involve buffing BLOPS combat ability to, ya know, not be shit once they hit the field  
---
Stationary ships have no velocity and ships don't have an orientation in EVEb The client just renders ships pointing a certain direction based on their velocity. Thus if you stop fast enough you won't level out as you do so, and the client will continue to render you pointing in whatever direction you were moving.
---
Plus, I was messing with domi fits before I left for wormholes and you can go with point, MJD, 3 heavy neuts, 1 medium neut, and 1 small neut all without losing significant dps. Running into that with any solo frigate is suicide, especially with a bomber.
---
I think a new ship is a bad idea. But the concept is good. The better option would be to have a mobile radar anyone could deploy that instantly pops up on the overview and takes 1 min to anchor. This then takes 30 seconds to analyze the system and gives you cloaked signatures that show up on your probe scanner for the entire fleet to see and probe down.
---
Glad to see that he is picking up on this.
---
Agree!
---
SKINs are such a simple way of generating revenue that provide no in-game benefits.  It's baffling how CCP has handled them.  Incomplete collections like you mention, inability to buy the vast majority of them in the NES store.  They're just leaving money on the table.
---
Well someone needs to pay for Concord.
---
Damn good idea!
---
Wish they would. Though, I can't see them ever doing it. 
---
Does anyone know of an MMORPG where killmails are tracked as extensively as Eve? I've always wondered what an Eve would look like without killmails. I imagine there less worry over KB efficiency and just people having fun without KM whoring and all the other nonsense.
---
Only 1 drone though.
---
Hat and wizard skin line up coming next, my Hecate will look great in royal blue with luminous yellow stars.
---
&gt; Changing the rules afterwards isn't cool. Imagine your boss or landlord changing your contract or lease after you signed it.
---
Read what I responded to again. If changing the rules is not cool, CCP has been very naughty. It's a stupid thing to say, really. Lots of things have been changed.
---
In fact, the station meta has already been changed once or twice as well, so there's already precedent.
---
&gt;asset decay
---
I don't think I mentioned that in this thread, so I assume you've seen my arguments elsewhere. If that's the case, you will already know my suggestion regarding asset safety is a lot more moderate than just deleting it (though that's my preference). You station dies for whatever reason. Asset safety is triggered. 15% chance your items go into loot. 85% chance your stuff moves to lowsec or another station in system. No fees to recover and no voluntary use of safety. Basically, you have the same average loss of wealth as today and the attackers have a chance at loot using current mechanics.
---
And to answer your question... Yes, I would.
---
Thanks for the tips. I’ll probably just run some missions for a while since I got cruisers up but I’m going to definitely remember this for when I try my hand at hauling again
---
Extended accel with Bio IV would get you 116,640 sp, and the small injector would only get you 50,000 at most if you have less than 5mil sp.
---
Interesting. That never occurred to me. Thanks.
---
I don't trust your username.
---
I call you a bad poster.
---
Problem is too many people would have to face the reality that they are actual shit at this game and it would hurt their fragile egos.
---
They’d rather be ‘winning’ where their biggest accomplishment in eve will ever be, applying to “Nullblock alliance 1” or “Nullblock Alliance 2”.
---
Long live blackout, long live chaos.
---
Best comment i read all day
---
With biology 4, you get 116640 extra SP than you would with regular training. However, it will be spread out over a period of nearly 6 days. With a small skill injector, you get at most 100000 SP and at least 20000 SP. I would go for the injector if you have under 5m SP personally, that extra 16000 SP can be made up for daily by doing the kill npc challenges.
---
My reaction after reading and looking at his name:  [https://imgur.com/gallery/YAGpXPd](https://imgur.com/gallery/YAGpXPd) old but I like this meme.
---
Small skill injectors give 100 000 SP if you have less than 5m
---
That’s the point. They’re complaining about destroyers getting dropped on them when we are actually throwing titans at them
---
Not bouncing the JF off the station model is about exciting as nullsec logistics get though... I wish there was more to it.
---
I am leaning that way myself! Basically trained up  to a 720 arty Loki, but concerned that a Domi will just neut me out and I’d be screwed...
---
Their colonyships probably have more firepower than our titans
---
Would it be better to run rails, or does the Proteus not have the capabilities for that?
---
And by that point, would it just be better to run a Loki?
---
Yeah I know, honestly wasn't my top pick either....next vid will be better
---
I think you do get some warning. A nice bright light appears.
---
Just give black ops battleships a built in cyno inhibitor.
---
Make an active cloak use capacitor, better meta cloaks use less capacitor on activation. This would force cloaky ships to decloak to recharge or at the very least fit capacitor buff mods which reduces buffs elsewhere on a ships fit.
---
A new ship to hunt cloaks isnt needed when the mechanics are there already.
---
I.e. bait, remember the drake.
---
But titans have been nerfed and buffed since their introduction and yet here we are..
---
Skill injectors... PLEX... time and effort means nothing anymore.
---
I'm gonna start with a possibly unpopular opinion and then offer some potential counters, based on how a similar situation works out in the real world.
---
The answer lies in studying submarine and anti-submarine warfare. In other words, cloaky gameplay is balanced for the most part (this is the possibly unpopular bit), because it works just like real life submarines: you a single vessel, possibly far behind enemy lines, stalking for easy or high value targets, you are almost impossible to detect, but attacking totally blows your cover. Sure, subs are silent and stealthy, but loading torpedo tubes, filling them with water to equalize pressure, opening the outer doors and pushing a few hundred kilos worth of explosives out the door using compressed air is kinda lout, not to mention the actual motor of the torpedo itself. The moment you fire, almost everyone around can get a bearing on your position and if they triangulate between them, they can also get a rough position fix.
---
In EvE, just as in real life, once you attack you have a few moments (in the game) or minutes (in a real submarine) to get a kill and gtfo, otherwise you're in biiiiig trouble.
---
But if you really want to add a counter to that, you don't even need to add another ship class. Just copy how it works in real life. Destroyers, frigates and corvettes, (not the ones we have in game, the real ones) are the usual types of ships that hunt down submarines. These, just like the subs, have both active and passive sensors. What's the difference between those?
---
A passive sonar is just listening for contacts (think similar to d-scan, if it's not hidden/cloaked you can pick it up up to a certain distance). An active sonar on the other hand broadcasts a pulse and stands a higher chance of picking up something, thanks to the echo of the sound pulse bouncing off the target. It can also give you a lot of information in a couple of pings, without having to do target motion analysis for minutes at a time just to pinpoint one target and the direction and speed he's moving (yes, this is more or less how it works in reality).
---
So what's the downside to going active? Well, when you broadcast a pulse, everyone around you can pick it up for miles. So you might not be able to detect something if it's far away or using terrain masking, but it certainly can hear you pinging away and can triangulate your position over time. A similar thing applies to radars as well. 
---
What's more, the distance a passive ship can pickup a contact that's going active is roughly double the active's detection range. Why? It's pretty simple. Think of an active sonar that can pick up targets 30 km away under optimal conditions. That means the pulse has enough energy to travel double that (30km to the target and 30km back to the source ship, for a total of 60 km). Now imagine a target sitting 45km away from you. Your pulse reaches the target since it's within its total "travel capacity" of 60km, but the echo dies down before it gets back to you, because the round trip is 90km, which is more than the 60 the pulse can do. Same thing applies to radars as well and it's the reason jets don't fly with their radars on 24/7.  If you have a radar with a scan range of 200km blasting away, you can be sure that the enemy's radar warning receiver instrument will light up like a christmas tree at distances at least 300km away. Now you don't get exact range to the target by "listening in" on enemy emissions, but you do get a measure of signal strength and that can help you infer the range to a certain extent.
---
So how do we adapt this to EvE?
---
Well, let's say we had active and passive modes for d-scan. Passive should be similar to what we have now, just d-scan and you get a list of what the scanner can see due to the targets' own electromagnetic emissions, signatures etc. Active d-scan should give you slightly better intel that gets more accurate the closer the target is. For example, let's say that once you click on something in the d-scan list after an active scan, you get a bearing indicator and a range estimate in the main game window, and a cone (similar to the one we have now for d-scan, but of a different color) in the system map. On the flip side, active d-scan would also give everyone in range an *exact* bearing and a range estimate towards you. If you start firing off pings from way off, you would actually be worse off than the guys who stay passive and listen to you pinging, because your accuracy would be more or less the same. But if you managed to get close first, you would get a position estimate on the target that is more accurate than his estimate on you based on your pinging.
---
So, what about ranges?
---
Well, the active one could have the same range as the passive one, or slightly more. But it should also have that "here i am, looking for you" effect as well. So, assuming similar ranges to the current d-scan for both active and passive modes (14.3 AU), setting off an active ping should make you "visible" to everyone within 28.6 AU. It would be usable by all classes of ships, regardless of being cloaked or not.
---
It would be interesting tbh and open up a lot more tactical uses for scanners and scouts (and maybe certain related roles for electronics specialized ships and recons), plus there are very tangible pros and cons to each method. You want to play it stealthy and keep silent? Stick to passive mode. You want to find that cloaker in your staging system or you're in an interceptor trying to pinpoint that super in the anomaly before it warps off? Ping away, but be prepared to let everyone know your approximate position in the process.
---
Sure, it's a sci-fi game, but sometimes copying real life leads to fairly balanced mechanics.
---
Ha, what a bitch. Self deleted.
---
The prot has the capabilieties for it but the falloff bonus for railguns never felt awesome :/
---
And you can't just fit all lows with damage mods since you have an armor tank
---
You can scram people though while staying outside their own scram range (if bait fit) with a proteus :)
---
Are you guys shunning ustz in this current form?
---
and unable to fir cyno &gt;\_&gt;
---
I'm not a coffee drinker though
---
There was a comment in another thread that mentioned how T1 capitals and supercapitals should play a basic role while T2 capitals and  supercapitals would have a specialized role at the expense of other aspects such as tank or mobility ala T1 cruisers vs HACs vs Recons.     
---
Such as T1 dreadnoughts being anti-structure, T1 carriers being anti-fighter, supercarriers being strictly dps with no support fighters, and titans being dps and bridge with no doomsday. Then to have T2 capitals with specialized roles, such as T2 dreadnoughts being able to use HAW weapons but less bonuses to capital weapons, T2 supercarriers can field support fighters but less bonuses to heavy fighters, and T2 titans being able to use doomsdays but reduced dps with regular guns.
---
Goddamn I hate you for making me upvote this comment. Good snark. Good post.
---
The biggest myth in Eve is that there is such a thing as a blue doughnut when it's trivial to demonstrate otherwise. It's like the flat-earther equivalent of EvE. Ignorant of reality and completely oppositional to verifiable fact.
---
Hauling shit from and to null just got very expensive
---
What cracks me up, is that everyone acts like the CCP "Artists" have to work tirelessly to come up with new Skins. Which is why it costs so damned much to buy them, b/c they're just such a work of art...
---
https://imgur.com/mHTK7zc
---
https://eve-nt.uk/designer/ can literally put any Skin on any ship in about 10 seconds. All CCP needs to do is put a price tag in the middle, and we could be flying so many sexy looking ships, and they could be raking in so much money.

But pretty much what /u/Rindfleischliebe sed no bot needed and not suffering of HDHD.
---
Perhaps bring a fleet and defang the carrier first, then deploy the inhib.   Cause seriously the idea that 1 subcap ship can go 1v1 against a capital is just getting old.  1 subcap launching a deployable structure which is exactly what people want capitals to be good at killing in the first place....   good grief.   Perhaps we should make carriers only able to launch 1 sentry drone so these undermanned subcap fleets can get their leet kills.
---
&gt;Remember, thousands of years have passed. More time than between now and when Hammurabi wrote his code (iirc). 
---
More like tens of thousands. 15,000, IIRC. All of human civilisation to the present day is only 12,000 years.
---
Pretty much. Supers never should have been able to dock. Citadels fucked up EVE in so many ways. This is coming from someone that has both a super and a Titan on one account and skill injected four rorquals and a merc miner on top of my two main accounts.

cal navy scrams are cheap as chips.

The problem with the rail prot is you might as well fly literally any of the other t3c's. Its dps is low, it can have tracking problems and biggest of all it is soooooo damn slow. Even with the long scram, if two things approach you at once you'll get caught. The loki can do most things better than the proteus.
---
I just want the Nyx Police skin to apply to the Vendetta....
---
&gt; would be very sad if i dont come across hundreds of players when getting my alt to jita or finding nothing when i decide to go hunt in null 
---
That's very true!
---
TY for these.
---
Lol.  You know it.  Bouncing off a station is just about one of the most awful feelings I have had in Eve.  Pretty close to bouncing off a gate in a Titan and then de-syncing at the same time.  
---
I agree that the JF do change content when compared to gaiting freighters, but rather than eliminating it, it shifts to different places.  Alignment from a station to a HS gate is a risky place and gating the JF though HS never gets dull.  
---
Looking at the kill mails for JF, it’s clear that it’s still a pretty unforgiving ship for carelessness or stupidly.  :-)
---
What do you get for scram range on a t2 with the point range bonus?
---
You think 1 min is too long? We have people who aren’t afk still get inhib Ed because they can’t fucking see them in space. Fuck off retard
---
Income tax ?
---
And some social wages for the poor HS players, while we are on it ?
---
Fuck blue doughnut, Let’s go to war!!!!  wait... they are another time zone, so that means we will have to alarmclock bash fleets at 4 am every day for the next month.  On second thought, blue doughnut isn’t so bad.
---
People are gonna light 2 instead. It wont solve anything and I honestly dont get why cynos is be an issue. I dont get why many of the things people complain about are gonna change anything.
---
&gt;Disagree. It's not the larger entities harmed by things like the blackouts - the larger entities can adapt and absorb the change. It's not the established players that are getting hurt by things like the blackout
---
Bingo! Another person gets it.

It’s because giving people a leaderboard to compete in gives people incentive to try hard and get to the top.... 95% of multiplayer games have some sort of leaderboard.... if eve took that down a lot of people would be done or feel less rewarded because only a few would know what happened..... it’s history in this game so that would be the worst idea ever.
---
Maybe once they're at that point, there's a more complicated multilevel hacking game to get into each player's hangars.
---
jesusrambo is right, drones that match the speed of a ceptor or that are a similar speed won’t do shit due to how drone ai works. Firstly drones use an approach command instead of cutting off an orbit so it takes them ages just to get into optimal and once they do, they will get maybe one shot off before they turn off their microwarpdrive and fall way behind, starting the cycle of chasing and shooting once all over again.
---
Noooo I’m in test - I just thought with blackout we’re supposed to be cloaked now?
---
I mean, imo it's better to avoid contracts altogether than to lightly dabble. There are scams, there are poor mechanics related to delivery and posting, item descriptions are bad... I fully avoid all public contracts and recommend the same to anyone that isn't into the market.
---
They are also a wormhole Corp now
---
Whenever someone lights a cyno, Aura appears and guides you to the Agency panel in order for you to see a quick 8 click process to finding out where it was lit.
---
I still think it's a travesty that they turned player created outposts into faction fortizars. Outposts took the coordination of countless hours of dozens or even hundreds of players and turned it into something a single player can do with a hauler and 15 minutes.
---
Why should defenders bear no burden to defend their assets?  Under attack? Just light a cyno and a limitless number of capitals/supers magically appears.  There’s no counter-play fir attackers. 
---
“Just escalate with more caps” is an enpty response and we both know it, no one who isn’t a massive null bloc can outnumber the null blocs, and no one can outnumber goon’s supers.
---
I’m not looking for east kills, I’m looking for some interesting counter play with cyno mechanics, not a magic button that basically spawns capitals.
---
Trolololol
---
Just give combat recons the ability to decloak ships around them. The counter is to blow up the combat recon with non-cloak ships.
---
EZ-PZ.
---
Why do you want a skin for a cloaked ship ?
---
Agreed. Cloaks should use capacitor.
---
It's 2019, and the first ship to ever demonstrate a warping animation (the crucifier) still hasn't actually had it implemented.
---
Any intel gathering outside of game shouldn't be allowed. Delete ESI. Dotlan, Zkill, evepraisal and all other Eve related services should go down. Forums, r/eve, and all Eve related discord should go down as well.  Let us go to age of tru, solo blind gameplay.
---
Your proposal would be the death of this game. You do not warp caps around to save people specifically due to drag bubbles people put up. Even in Delve we do not warp caps on grid anywhere. Constantly having 30-40 people sitting around to save others is already a taxing job but to have a mechanic that requires you to have 100+on stand by ready to go at a moments notice is just impossible. And what if the enemy brings in dreads and warps them to the one ship that got bubble dragged and now we need even more to save that person. Like you are trying to make the simple act of making money the worst slogfest in Eve. If you want to kill caps on Eve, it’s not that hard just a lot of effort.
---

People are repetitive, guy that logs on at five pm us east m-f to have fun will always appear at same time regardless of time delay. It would either need to be randomized delay, or just gone entirely else the same info can be derived by just looking at now()- offset.
---
Nobody 'owns' moon rocks. If the game doesn't put your name on it, it's not yours. Don't like them mining the rocks? Stop them. If you can't, well, sucks to be you. This is eve, if your guns can't cash the checks your mouth writes then you lose.
---
Thanks for sharing
---
Reinforcement timers. Gate guns.
---
This module wouldn't do much to uncloak cloacky campers if we need to be that close to them.
---
That's all fine for people who pvp, but that's not your audience if you're trying to convince people to spread out. Not everyone likes pvp in Eve. This is blasphemous, I know, but there it is.
---
&gt;Why should the defenders bear the burden of the challenge?
---
Do you think they shouldn't have any?
---
&gt;If you want an easy kill...
---
It doesn't matter what I want. I asked you if you thought OP's change would add the kind of challenge and counter play you were so sad to see be 'removed'. To be perfectly clear, I was pointing out that your argument was a bit hypocritical.
---
&gt;And I’d like to point out that: 1.) the same people who want these inhib changes typically also want carriers to not apply to subcaps.
---
Ok...? 
---
&gt;2.) If you think that NPCs aren’t defenseless just because they shoot back (since as you say someone who can shoot isn’t defenseless) then maybe the issue is that you’re really *quite* bad at EVE.
---
I hope thats a typo. I'm not talking about NPCs. I'm referring to the pilot shooting them.
---
&gt;re so cheap that building them is unprofitable maybe it's not that complicated then? Seems like there isn't any major bottleneck.
---
The reason why capitals are so cheap is that there are people with 100s of billions of liquid isk who go to delve and buy ore in massive quantities below usual % price, sometimes at 80% of jita buy. So if youre buying ore in Jita from sell or buy orders, youre competing with someone who is making more than twice the profit you are. And they can afford to go lower. 
---
I was making about 5 capitals (mostly faxes) every week. I know a guy who has 75 dreads in stock.
---
Now that you mention it the risk that remains for JFs is actually in highsec, and almost entirely due to a lack of cynos. 
---
I've been thinking that teleportation was a mistake, or at least poorly conceived. It breaks EVE's metageography, eliminates chances for unplanned content, and keeps bigger targets safer than smaller ones. Running a gatecamp in a blockade runner is an adrenaline rush for both predator and prey. Cynoing a JF around is not.
---
You forgot username is wingspantt.
---
The capitals that land can just re cyno.. so now you'll just have a dozen cynos on grid.
---
Maybe we can sell DLC cloak effects too. POE pulls off that stuff pretty well!
---
Ah i see!
---
I'll try that out. Thank you sir!
---
Too fast. Use some old abandoned (but still functioning) computer as the server to receive information. When sending data out transmit it to some arduino board hosting a second server instead that will release the data on some endpoint. Set the baud rate as low as you want...
---
????  
---
PROFIT!
---
It is when CCP devs hand them out to alliance mates when they shouldn't have.
---
Because that's their playstyle? Also 99 times out of a hundred, guys like you (Goons) brings a FAX and three fucking Titans down on any small amount of fleet that wanders in from a WH. I know from experience.
---
underrated
---
&gt; Why should defenders bear no burden to defend their assets?  Under attack? 
---
Uh. They do? Already?
---
&gt; Just light a cyno and a limitless number of capitals/supers magically appears.  
---
Yeah I’m glad that you think supers and pilots and semi-competent FCs just spawn into existence whenever a cyno is lit and are not actually organized and prepared ahead of time to have that kind of response time. I’m sorry you’re lazy and your target groups aren’t I guess.
---
&gt; There’s no counter-play fir attackers.
---
If you believe this then you’re bad. If you know how your opponent responds and can’t figure out how to run two brain cells together to plan and prepare appropriately that’s not my problem. It’s not the defenders job to feed you easy kills so you can brag on Reddit about how elite your small gang skills are.
---
Eh building a JF is really easy once you build a spreadsheet lol
---
Actually hurts big groups more because more structures.... I see big groups with more low power fortizars than anything else in every system... however smaller groups normally have no issue fueling 5-10 structures if they are actually utilizing them.
---
thats just a minmatars version of a cloak
---
With Hilmar as CEO, that will never happen.
---
True it is just the sheer number of reactions required is a pain along with the fuel blocks
---
Yeah, but they would have wasted a high slot putting them at a disadvantage. And it's not like they can't do that currently.
---
As someone that has built capitals, and currently has a hangar full of titan &amp; super BPC that are not selling, because the market is so saturated ...
---
1.  It's too late.  Like a decade or more too late.   
---
2.  Anything production related, less than 'Palatine' insanity (or Upwell rigs), will be inconsequential.     
---
3.  Capitals are T1 ships, so the added manufacturing complexity above-and-beyond the normal, is them being made from T1 capital components.    
---
4.  No good plan survives contact with Eve players.
---
&gt; I am pretty sure who postrd it, a ~~Rorqual~~ ratting carrier hunter who is butt hurting.
---
I already have the skills for t2 manufacturing and supercapital production on multiple characters, bring it on!
---
&gt;putting them at a disadvantage
---
... Not really? Maybe they'll lose a neut? It's not a huge nerf. And would do nothing to reduce capital projection.
---
Remember the mass limit too
---
&gt;mass limit
---
-2 caps ump in
---
-Light 2 cynos
---
-4 caps jump in
---
-Light 4 cynos

-Rinse/repeat.

---
Wait...this isn't Columbia, SC.
---
&gt; Why should defenders bear no burden to defend their assets? Under attack? Just light a cyno and a limitless number of capitals/supers magically appears. There’s no counter-play fir attackers.
---
There is a counterplay: just magically summon up a countless number of buddies to join the fleet before you leave for your nano roam.
---
This game should be named "scam online".
---
I feel like some of the replies in this thread have inadvertently given you an answer for why this kind of stuff happens.
---
Forget that wheres the Proteus Serpentis skin?
---
So your question got me thinking, and I put something together a pair of fits in Pyfa for you if you're interested.
---
The first is a Mastodon. As I said, it'll have a warp core strength of 6, meaning they'll need to get a lot of scrams on you to keep you still. Your align time will be around 18-20s, so ideally that's all the time you'll need to tank for. Good thing is that's what these ships are meant for. Tanking heavy damage for just long enough to get aligned and accelerated.
---
Here's the Mastodon fit, Pyfa says 340m ISK.
---
    [Mastodon, Mastodon fit]
---
    Warp Core Stabilizer I
---
    Republic Fleet Large Shield Extender
---
    Adaptive Invulnerability Field II
---
    Medium Ancillary Shield Booster, Navy Cap Booster 100
---
    Pithum C-Type Medium Shield Booster
---
    10MN Y-S8 Compact Afterburner
---
    [Empty High slot]
---
    Medium Core Defense Field Extender II
---
    Medium Anti-Kinetic Screen Reinforcer II
---
With all skills to 5 in Pyfa, this ship is sitting on a buffer of 10k raw shield HP, and will generate 269.8 raw HP per second. That doesn't sound like much, but its shield resist profile is pretty good so that translates into a pretty good amount of EHP/s generated. With the ancil on, the enemy needs to make 1483 dps to start to scratch your tank. With the ancil off it's 852 dps.
---
Now here's the Bustard fit, which I think is WAY better coming in at 380m ISK. 
---
    [Bustard, Bustard fit]
---
    10MN Afterburner II
---
    Medium Anti-EM Screen Reinforcer II
---
    Medium Core Defense Field Purger II
---
The main downside to this fit is that it only has 5 points of warp core strength rather than the 6 the Mastodon has, and your cap gives you about 24 seconds fewer before your reps die. With the ancil the enemy needs to make over 2000 dps to hurt you, and about 1200 with the ancil off.
---
To summarize, here's a table comparing the two:
---
|Stat|Bustard|Mastodon|
---
|:-|:-|:-|
---
|Max Total Reps w/ Ancil|2066.9 EHP/s|1483.2 EHP/s|
---
|Tax Total Reps w/o Ancil|1201.8 EHP/s|852.4 EHP/s|
---
|Passive Shield Regen (included in above numbers)|236 EHP/s|148 EHP/s|
---
|Total Raw Shield HP|8812 HP|10,125 HP|
---
|Total Shield EHP against Uniform Damage|66,457 EHP|55,684 EHP|
---
|Warp Core Strength|5|6|
---
|Capacitor Lasts (Overheated)|3:00|3:21|
---
|Max Total Reps w/o Ancil, cap stable|621.6 EHP/s|516.9 EHP/s|
---
Overall I'd definitely pick the Bustard. Yes, you're a little bit more likely to get caught by scrams with 5 rather than 6 warp core strength, but you can tank so much more in it than you can in the Mastodon. Your main worry is going to be getting neuted out. If the enemy brought neuts with them -- which they may very well do -- you could be fucked. If you're not totally scrammed you only have to tank for 18 seconds. But if you are totally scrammed you could be holding on for a while and trying to outlast their caps. In this case, I'd be pulsing my reps. You've got a fair bit of buffer there and a decent bit of passive regen, and according to Pyfa you can still tank some decent damage if you manage your cap correctly. Neuts will make life hard and may prevent you from warping at all, but all you can do is hope.
---
Unless you have an alt! If you have an alt you can bring with you there's a few ways you can go about it. One way would be logi. You could bring a ship fit with capacitor and shield transmitters which would help keep your DST alive and with cap. Method #2 is bringing your own neuting ship. You'd use this against the ships scramming your DST so that it can warp out. Method #3 is bringing some EWAR to make it so they can't target your DST. Something like an ECM burst could help; you'd use this once your DST is aligned and going fast enough to warp so that the scrams come off it. Challenge here is that your DST has such a huge signature radius that they'll get it locked back up almost instantly. Method #4 is bringing in some firepower of your own to take out the enemy point. My personal preference would be a speed tanking drone boat like an Ishtar or Astero. This would send drones after the small stuff that's scramming your DST so that you can get your cargo out.
---
So essentially you would jump 6-10 capitals without that one extra high slot into hostile territory? You know where potentially n+1 capitals can just be undocked.
---
thats because aviators are awesome and starmaps are boring 
---
lore makes sense
---
It's literally just a high slot. Again. You lose at max a neut or a smart bomb.
---
Also you could just bridge a shitload of subcap cynos
---
Delete this
---
how about only showing daily kills 15 minutes before DT? like, in the last 24h, in &lt;system&gt;, 1337 pirate ships, 20 capsuleers ships and 1 pod were destroyed. Killmails get generated at the same time and you get killmarks added every time you dock in a station / citadel if you killed a player ship
---
Good post.
---
And a Guardians' Gala "Spirit" skin while we're at it.
---
Bridge in ten brick tank Abaddons. Ten cynos now on grid. Problem solved.
---
&gt; Do you think they shouldn't have any?
---
What a dumb question. Please tell me you meant that as some kind of would-be snide remark and not actually curious. Nothing I’ve said even remotely suggests that.
---
&gt; It doesn't matter what I want. 
---
It might not matter to you but it does to me actually.
---
&gt; I asked you if you thought OP's change would add the kind of challenge and counter play you were so sad to see be 'removed'. 
---
I’ll clarify: if you need crutches and handicaps to be a good hunter then you’re not a good hunter. If you want to make ships explode in space with very little risk them shoot NPCs. Defenders already have the burden of defending as if they don’t then you get easy kills. Not sure how that’s a foreign concept for some people.
---
&gt; To be perfectly clear, I was pointing out that your argument was a bit hypocritical.
---
My argument being that if you need your target to be unable to save itself or escalate even when the opponent does stuff right that you should instead shoot NPCs because that’s more your speed is hypocritical in what way?
---
I’m bad at EVE. I shoot lots of NPCs. Sometimes I try and shoot players. Occasionally I kill them. Often I get countered. I don’t complain that I need my preferred playstyle buffed. I don’t sit around and suggest Supers and Titans be buffed despite that being my preferred gameplay. I even willingly suggest possible changes that hurt my gameplay for the improvement of the game as a whole.
---
What I don’t do is shit up Reddit claiming that because I’m bad at whaling that whaling should be made easier by removing any possible risk of my opponent counter-dropping me.
---
I also don’t complain that because I lost a carrier a few weeks back to me being bad and getting outplayed by a small blops gang that blops should be nerfed.
---
So please share what you’re talking about.
---
Yes, you could plan a whole invasion. Your not getting it. It's not gonna affect an alliance that planned an incursion months ahead. What it's meant to do is improve small gang pvp experience.
---
Hey just started the other day, and I have a weird problem. Whenever I try to dock to a new station I get a black screen and can only see my cursor. I've googled and people say for undocking you can hit f10 to get rid of black screen but that doesn't work for me. I can restart the game everytime to fix it but I'd rather not do that every time. This might be happening cause I have bad internet but idk. Any help would be appreciated.
---
That sounds perfect to me. Gets people back in Black ops battleships and justifies their price. Dunno about ALL navigation mods, but that can be tweaked on.
---
In other words “please remove all barriers to me blowing up sub cap ratters”
---
I mean I actually kinda like your idea, but I was just pointing out a flaw in it.
---
Tbh the sexiest bomber hull deserves the sexiest gallente skin.
---
Upwell structures need one manually configured stront timer. A system that people can make mistakes on will create content.
---
Worst case scenario, you can move out of the system in your pod and come back for anything left behind later.
---
 NPC's do not target pods.
---
Are you using the steam launcher? Steam will automatically re-add your steam account as a new eve account to the launcher even if you don't use it and have another main account.
---
Hell, it wouldn't even make a difference to a little solo guy like me building freighters and a dread/carrier or two here and there.
---
I'm already so well established that adding another step or two in my logistics process would be a minor annoyance and nothing more. I might even have to add a whole extra JF trip during resupply. The horror.
---
Are you targeting higher volume low isk items or high isk low volume?
---
Just guessing here... are the two mentioned skills Omega only? If it’s the case, it’s just another blow at boters
---
You call them noobs but you cant defend your own moonrocks lmfaoooo
---
Someone link this dude any null blocks standard cap fits. I believe the wording in our forums is "always have a cyno fit you fucking idiots."
---
Make pilots aim their jump drive. If aimed poorly, then the ship lands out of range for guns and reps. 
---
A better solution than putting ship or mass limits on.
---
64bit D-scan review next, pity please.
---
&gt; You could use the scanner probe interface to also create a dynamic where you have options. For instance, maybe you can hang a really wide-area of 16 AU, but ships will only stay revealed for one second. But if you use a really narrow and precise hit, ships could stay revealed for longer.
---
Something something tachyon field something something Romulans something something Mr. Data
---
They actually made a really advanced tool to even allow players to make skins in engine.
---
So it's pretty easy for them at this point.
---
Literally the OG Wingspan
---
So then this is not gonna hurt you, goon. Why resist?
---
Would be new strategy to just jump a bunch of Titans to the cyno to try to bump the jump freighter.
---
Since they removed the de facto upkeep cost of titans and supers (POS bubbles, alts that had to sit in them, etc) create an upkeep cost for titans and supers. No capital ship should be able to just sit for free forever until hotdrop time. Concord tax or something. Nice isk sink too.
---
I’d join
---
I'd be glad if the Cloak effect were just consistent.
---
Every time you change the Skin on a ship, it radiates outward from the center.
---
Every time you cloak or decloak, it radiates from some random point each time.
---
It's not the worst implementation, and it's free to use, so big props there.  My biggest issue is; with the "no broadcasting keystrokes" rule, this implementation suffers from input lag when you are swapping between clients that you wouldn't get with a large/multi monitor setup and multiple windows.
---
Earth settled New Eden by going through a wormhole.  The wormhole collapsed (they didn’t know about mass or time limits). 
---
Since the colonies still depended on Earth for supplies, that wormhole collapsing was really bad.  It effectively threw everyone in New Eden back to the Stone Age.
---
So yes, Earth would have technology far superior to anything in New Eden, because New Eden had to spend a few thousand years playing “reinvent the wheel”.
---
Over all bad idea. Here why nearly every super/titan has a cyno. Most every carrier/fax has a cyno as their default fit. The only thing that might possibly suffer are dreads. Even then the average is 1 in 4 that has a cyno. Larger groups will just bring more no questions asked.
---
**And those capitals can't run now.** Risk adverse 101.
---
It will expire while it is in your head.
---
Only dreads lack a cyno even then you only lost utility high for it.
---
While I won’t deny that there is probably the odd ISboxer out there, this is very doable manually. 
---
I’ve ran 12-13 toons in VGs a fair bit with Gilas and Ishtars out in null. The limitation was my PC.
---
didnt even notice till you pointed it out
---
for a moment i mistook those megas for barges
---
In case you don't know, input broadcasting is bannable offense.
---
Drone bunny FTW!
---
I haven't roamed providence in about 2 years Valkorisia??? Are you ok?
---
Multiboxing with automation is allowed now?
---
Which is why I mention that specifically in why I prefer not using this program :) 
---
Yes, broadcasting inputs is against the TOS.
---
I believe in the past as long as you chugged it before the expiration date, you got the full effect.
---
Ah, so those are a bit trickier - "developing" storylines aren't explained so clearly on the CCP sites. For Drifter, Sleeper, and Triglavian lore I suggest you check out the Arataka Research Consortium (Youtube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLK40KD-CfvF-TuHgRhxHDA), Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/Ex3Z5j) ) - they are specialists in exploring all things Wormhole and precursor related.

---
You really should read office memos from devs.
---
Why unable to play?
---
you said it your self unfuck your overview
---
I actually originally typed 90-100KM but thought that would be a far reach. The idea is to not remove cloak camping but to just make it more aware.
---
I hope your water gets some coffee
---
Ah, I was too quick to judge. I thought you don't like it because it does not let you input broadcast. Apologies.
---
Lol you're an idiot.
---
It was showing you the market details of the item.
---
The copy is a copy of that item.
---
Currently doing some traveling overseas, so I can’t lock myself in my room and play like I’m itching to.
---
Sucks to suck
---
Yep... Been a problem for many many years... ALWAYS look for (BLUEPRINT COPY) in the other contract... Copies are also a lighter shade of blue.
---
Scams are a big part of EVE. You really have to read the fine print on everything dealing with contracts. I would advise you not to even look at contracts for the first month or two of playing.
---
If your gone bye, but I hope you’ll give it another go. EVE is hard, and this is just one massive loss you’ll have on the journey.
---
Eve has ~~sound~~ a map?
---
not contract, trade.
---
I see your a man of culture as well, very nice here's my upvote.
---
because "I HAVE HAVE THE POWER" and honestly its a poor idea from a gameplay mechanics side of things. Also as shown by others in these comments it doesn't solve what you consider to be a problem.
---
nah, this game expects you to have years of experience before playing.
---
I actually logged into the game today. Spun my ship 100+ times in a station . Then I logged off. Op Success.
---
Same thing with a trade...
---
Can i have the rest of your stuff?
---
where are the current new player starting systems? all the lists I've found seem to be outdated
---
... so Amarrian?
---
This is why they lose people allowing people to run scams hurts the game.
---
One may as well sit in a station and just run scams no need to mine pvp or explore.
---
Strong work. Congrats.
---
You can "assist" up to 50 drones to any ship in the game. The ship who has those drones assisted to him is known as the drone bunny. The drone bunny in this case has 2,310 scan resolution and can target out to 212km. It is also a procurer.
---
He's just gave away 5000 bitcoin in a jita doubling event
---
I had to learn that the USB ports and Ethernet jacks should point in the desired direction.
---
However, I have a corpmate that still gets that wrong, and I'd love to correct.
---
unless things changed, not just ceos, but any director in either corp.
---
would be a shame to this narrative if those hunters who were thriving weren't pretty much completely in favor of these changes, and showed support since the very start.

I think the super weapon Jamyl used was from a freighter.  You know those transport ships with one high slot?   That’s how powerful a single weapon on a transport ship was

Exactly. Someone gets it. I’m fine with scams in the game, but this scam works off an exploit. There’s a difference between “Give me all your isk and i’ll double it” and actually using an exploit. Also spam bots are allowed, look at redbull energy, been spamming in jita foever

They have continuous history longer than the other four.  Is that better?

I wouldn't try to take a myrm in anything less than a cruiser, simply due to drone dps and their tendency to fit neuts. With anything smaller you have to sacrifice cap, tank, or dps and you need all 3 to kill a myrm reliably.

From memory the people working in the gate should be reporting to the system owners whos using the gate, a short story in one of the eve magazines covered this, if ccp is using RP to justify things. This means if you gate into the system you appear in local, if you cyno or wh you dont.

Because right now all of the super ratting is being done under a super umbrella, because that is the only relatively safe way to do it. Taking out the map data will allow players a sense of security to rat outside an umbrella because people will actually have to come to your system to see you are ratting. Do people actually use this info to hunt Imperium ratters? We know where they are without opening Doltlan. Delve, 1DQ1-A supercap jump range.

Huginn as drone bunny, Nestor logi, remote reps on domis in case Nestor is aggressed.

All capitals might as well be built with Capital Tech class materials (moon+planet+PI+???), preferably bottlenecked and contestable.
---
Further, operation and maintenance of capitals should also rely on these materials.  Ammunition and module charges?  Capital Tech materials.  Fighters and modules?  Capital Tech materials.  Jump fuel?  Capital Tech materials.  Capital nanite paste and hull repair modules?  Unicorn tears, of course.
---
In the best case scenario, the secret ingredient in Capital Tech should be bulky materials without the option of compression.  One possibility is a Iapetan class Upwell Moon Mining Beacon that provides moon barf mineable with something that works like an ice miner.  One big chunk per cycle, no volume reduction on refining and therefore super difficult to export or import.

Loki doesn't get a point range bonus, just webs..... Are you referring to the Proteus?

Never do trade windows, there is even a big popup telling you not to do it.

Wish there was a mode where you hpld s button and use your mouse to manipulate a line and then when you release the button, your ship rotates to point that way.

What would you do if you had all the resources?

About as much as Navy X-Ray

Not that uncommon of a fit tbh

Allowing exploits, botting, scamming, and spam bots, and raising taxes for no fucking reason.

90% of people are bad at math, and the remaining 40% can't even understand simple percentages on thing like sale items.

I cant think of a single mmo that is as "serious" as eve where this level of detailed info is given away. Most games dont allow you to lose your stuff, so to give away info that makes it easier to lose your stuff is just retarded.
