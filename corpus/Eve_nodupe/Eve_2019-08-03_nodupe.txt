My view is that most of the PvE is to make ISK (so no specific need the for ratting or ded site loot).  You might have more fun getting into some NPSI fleets such as Bombers Bar (join in-game channel: Bombers Bar - not sure if it is spelt as Bomber's) or Spectre Fleet (SF Spectre Fleet).  Either has a list of different fleets with ships/fittings needed (and therefore skills to train towards).  Let them know you are new and they will help out.  Good fun travelling all over New Eden in fleets of 20-150 in various ships and roles.

---
If you are PLEXing though, the world is your oyster and your playtime entirely what you want it to be.

---
This is only applicable to C3 sites and below, C4+, especially C5 sites, will murder a solo BC.
---
Ccp’s way of saying idgaf anymore. Let it burn.

meh

&lt;3 you Marroc
---
it was all mostly done during a big CTA fleet for an XIX ihub in Detorid. In classic EVE fashion, both fleets sat on opposite sides of one gate for what felt like 3 hours. FRT blew up the iHub, LegacyTESTImperium stuck a new one down immediately. I'd say the LegacyTESTImperium forces did win the day seeing as they managed to get all this done while FRT camped the gate. But not much FRT could have done considering they were already outnumbered on the big op, not many bodies to spare throwing at toasters regions away. C'est la vie etc.
---
No, you're not. Thats where EVE get's into Excel territory.
---
Although with the enourmous list of BPO's and quite a lot of different input materials, you might not want to go that route. (Lets say you make more money per tritanium producting &lt;item A&gt;, you make a decent margin on the pyrite, but for the isogen you really want to build &lt;item B&gt;. and so on.
---
Generally Try https://eve-industry.org/calc/ or https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/blueprint/ for some online calculators.
---
But you might want to set up your own spreadsheets to also keep track of your production timelines that eat into your isk/hr.
---
The rigs aren't really the issue here though. The main difference in-between pve and pvp ships lie mostly in cap stability + pvp modules like scram/disruptor.
---
Really, pvp ships will often fit in a way where cap lasts maybe 1-2 mins (especially in solo fights) because they can get better dps, tank and mobility during the fit as a trade off.
---
A pve ship will want a mostly cap stable ship because pve fights are generally longer and you want to be able to run multiple sites in a row, without having to wait for your cap to recharge.

No point in spying when literally nothing is happening in 90% of null

---
Because Daybreak (sure they were called SOE back then) has never pushed awful changes on an MMO that existing players hated and ultimately killed them game?
---
It has NEVER been consistent or reliable.
---
Yea, peddle your bullshit elsewhere.  I showed that you claim that we didn't do nothin in vale was bullshit, your response was lol we fed you bait rorqs because we're incompetent.
---
Fuck off with that laughable bullshit.
---
then login more
---
Dude, dont embarrass yourself further. We were talking about 1 thing and now you are pretending like its 20 million things. Just take the loss, accept youre an idiot and move on.
---
It was me. Please send me the ISK and I'll have it delivered. Thanks.
---
youre really not good at taking hints are you?
---
Hahaa
---
Check the raitaru on Dscan and the combat anoms. :bigthonk:
---
I'd ask the toons for their opinion
---
If you randomly bug local so that it doesn’t display local, but random sets of systems, do it sporadically, randomly, if you’re watching for activity, you can see whose bot warps to safe or POS or wherever when the flippy-dippy shit happens.
---
When CCP was talking about adding more chaos to Eve, I did not know they were referring to the actual programming of the game.

yeh it is a good sub, one of the few gaming subs where karma whoring and other bullshit is largely downvoted. Unlike subs such as r/warframe

That pilot is honest. You don't see that often.
---
How does anomaly despawning work. When I finish a relic site, does it immediately disappear from probe overview? Does a new one pop up in that system?
---
AWOX!
---
This is the best thing on reddit
---
Battle Procs ftw
---
Go roqual you can compress and jump with a massive ore hold fleet hanger and cargo hold just be sure to post on reddit your jump plan or just gate it.
---
Didn't they already try this?
---
If you wanna fly big (non capital) ships, highsec lvl4 missions are pretty fun. The missions vary so there's a bit of strategy in picking your fit.
---
Too busy laughing at your attempted talking points turned weasel worded defense when presented with evidence that your original claim was rank bullshit.
---
*Fund a random keepstar sitting beneath a corp hanger*
---
Keepstar and structure proliferation is so bad that it can slip the mind of major corps.
---
Technically the same thing happens in wormholes and abyssal space so you should revert to an earlier skill level when you get prodded in those spaces by lore
---
What about burner missions? Have you tried those out yet?

yeah, weird, /u/Leonard-MeadowLion never replied to me? calls me a narrative spinner with no basis, i give basis, and he stops replying?
---
You're surprised the rest of eve finally decided to adapt?
---
Can imagine.
---
your whole argument were 2 dead bait rorquals that failed. that might work on the goonies but not on someone who was in CO2 when panfam took Tribute from us and quite frankly, your "hurdurr you PL, you tryin to backpaddle, look how retarded i am REEEEE" is getting annoying -_-'
---
Someone is salty
---
Objectives and stories be damned, watching those chemo Loki’s rip through the goon harpy fleet like an abomination tearing through its hosts stomach in a horror movie was damn fucking sexy to watch.
---
i mine moon goo and thats non compressible so is rorqual good idea still?

---
For sure, I would only do the BC in C1 and C2, my Gila needs all faction shield extenders and rechargers with T2 purgers to make it work solo in C3s.

thanks for this :)

Oh I remember something like that ye. I always thought those versions were Microsoft. It was a better, naive era.
---
https://youtu.be/s6I6QEPDTVA
---
I literally don't know how many we have in goonswarm. I think it's 41+ though.
---
like, dude
---
You're not really supposed to haul moon ore, you just reprocess it locally.
---
Oh ye no doubt. I do iindustry myself, margins are there. But never seen doubling or tripling. And we were talking about regular ore which is very much never those margins. But that part was probably an assumption on my part since he was talking about spod.
---
My argument was PL accidentally fed rorqs trying to disable the jumpbridge we used to get to northwest vale in preparation for pushing into vale post M-0.
---
I could go dig up the ton of posts from PL bitching about how our evac from vale fucked up their winter content plans, but simply put, two dead toaster rorqs that died toasting a critical Ihub were enough to put your initial assertion that you had done nothing and were intending to do nothing to vale sov.
---
Claiming they were "bait rorqs" is a laughably weak defense, unless you are trying to claim that your bait operation was ran by rank incompetents, which is laughable for different reasons.
---
You just didn't think anyone would have anything to call you on your bullshit.  Lol.
---
In space, nobody can hear you scream like a little girl.
---
The true blackout surfaces, lol.
---
If only CCP had FC.  They could ask FC, What do?
---
Ye you can. And it will however be better than 5 others quitting. For the game. But I hope you dont. We need players.
---
Its not a balance issue.
---
I have never needed a bailout. Ever. 
---
I guess.
---
That balance is impossible to get.
---
not really, that other person would suffer the same penalty, and would they really stick around in a belt under such a penalty when another belt would likely not penalize them?  I suggested the Rorq get a baseline buff over what a single one has now, and the stack penalty would be less than this buff, allowing for some flexibility in numbers, but not to numbers that is more multibox likely.  Think something like a 30% buff, but a 7%-9% penalty, limiting a single belt to 3 Rorqa before it becomes more efficient for any additional Rorqs to look elsewhere.
---
Well, TEST, at any rate
---
i am not in PL, i have never been in PL, i have no reason to defend anything, you're just babbling nonsense that is all. and now good night, im done wasting braincells reading your garbage.
---
Cool, you can finally take my initial advice to go peddle your bullshit elsewhere then.
---
Well... technically since the intro mission isn't mandatory that was avoidable too ;)
---
I was thinking about making nullsec Incursions/the hard nullsec content more about using very expensive battleship classes, like the Marauder or expensive deadspace fit pirate battleships. Those die to all sorts of stuff if they get caught. If PVE contents are designed for capitals then I think some sort of soft or hard number limit should be in place. Maybe something like scaling spawns with increasing number of capitals but the same overall payout per site? I dunno. 
---
I would say the problem is more about the current anoms being mindless, though. They have not changed since a decade (or more?) ago, spawn infinitely, and you won't even die AFK if you set up correctly in an Ishtar/VNI. The payout per site is low but so is the effort, so we are forced to do a lot of them if we want to krab. I know EVE being a very economical game means PVE would always need some consistency, but currently it's too much and too boring. At the very least the rats should use the new AI so they are not as dumb as they currently are.
---
Working as intended or?......  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
CCP, who knows...
---
don't mine in an orca
---
Are you sure you wanna waste your life on 20misk/hr?
---
Back when we had SOV, we actually ticked off every around us by fully upgrading the Quantum Flux Generator ( we're extremely comfortable with wormholes obviously). But everyone around us had nothing but hatred for us because of it.
---
lol
---
Is it better than mining in a coveter right now? I can't fly exhumers or anything.
---
It is pretty dull for sure. Should i expect to get around 20mil /hr?
---
Assuming in the best case scenario you found plenty of plagioclase
---
talking to people is dumb anyway just spell it out with a series of artfully placed mobile depots
---
+1 gotg was present for the war of the last summer. Look at the BR of the big battle.
---
At least gotg jump their titan in fight range...
---
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
---
Nah
---
Hard to make a list given basically all of them are so old, but I've definitely had my share of dumb/avoidable deaths as well. Heck, even my two recents ones were, one in PVP and one in PVE. For the former, sucks losing a ship after a 22 kill streak to basically indecision, even if the ship itself was a T1-fitted Catalyst. For the latter, being too tired to realize to bug out when things got hairy (Anomic Team burner mission).
---
i personally would refine them and use them for industry instead of selling the most expensive ore and buying the ore you need. it will just be to much running around. Also hey man the game isnt just about farming isk if you have fun mining and building things have at it.
---
And as you fly past the abandoned, derelict stations of the once mighty Jove empire, a mournful tune drifts replaces the regular in-game music. Preferably a "sad" cover of Below the Asteroids.
---
Damn i'm pretty new to the game, but its good to see that someone who works at CCP is mixing with the Community on reddit. Is this a common occurrence?
---
Because defending it costs? Why pay to do something when you can get it for free by doing nothing?
---
Myrm can do C3s with its snazzy tank bonus.
---
It was the same with ncpl some years ago ; the round turn you know!
---
You are right, im only really sad that alpha players don't get given a refund on the skills they can't use anymore
---
Were you possibly roaming in brave space?
---
I was talking about Init invading Rage. I have no info or claims about other fights. I’m not anybody whose making those kind of decisions :) I’m just the line member who did my best to fight for you when y’all asked for help.
---
perhaps if you are a random line member you shouldn't be calling me a narrative spinner then when it's pretty clear there is some basis for what i am talking about :)
---
I was running lvl 5 missions and when i warped to a neutral citadel i landed at the same time with a 200 man pandemic horde fleet.
---
There were 5 people in local chat.... i had to wash my pants after :(
---
Doors closing on play styles and fleet metas is not new. RIP Nanophoon and Cav Ravens. Decide to move on or go down with the ship.
---
The main reason I didn't compare them to T1 destroyers is that the Kikimora - just the base ship itself - costs about a 100 times more than them. And in general at the end of the day the precursor ships are still "advanced" ships, not really directly equivalent to T1.
---
Thanks for the tip! I have noticed that the drones are SUPER slow!
---
I really think that people should get a one time offer to get the locked out levels refunded as SP if they where alpha and active within 90 days of the change.
---
Ty for reply! Now I understand ty :)
---
Ehhhh maybe, probably shouldn’t have posted. All I know is what I experienced. I’m not going to convince you one way or the other, and should just stay out of the argument. o7
---
It's an imperfect world though, you can't always dictate the range.
---
thats fine, i get you want to defend your corp, everyone wants to defend their mates when they are getting shit on. unfortunately like i said there's a pretty big basis for your leadership having done what im talking about, and line members unfortunately find out those sorts of things the hard way.
---
best of luck hope to see you in space.
---
have as much ehp with as cheap mods as possible, DONT use barges in hisec other than procurers that are fit tanked to hell. 
---
Nowadays people have literally limitless funds to throw at griefing, and they will if you give them anything other than a super hard target
---
So... my tanked orca then?
---
Lmao
---
To give them credit.  This is a hell of a lot easier than trying to compete with it.
---
After all, typing a few threads on reddit is enough to get their designated reddit reader (Falcon) to believe it, as he and Hilmar are very open about their preferences...
---
That is so much easier than having to farm and build and band together with others and then set up infrastructure.... So yeah.  Hurf and blurf pvp op
---
Ouch that hurt me
---
Listening to BaseEight was half the reason to be in standing coms, especially when hes drunk
---
Karmafleet flair... checks out
---
Tanked orca is a lot more “passive” too.  But yeah
---
Buut keep in mind that lvl 4 missions are pretty neglected (old) content and they do get repetitive. Probably not a good longterm thing to go with if you want to avoid being burned out, but it's something that can easily mix with other things.
---
Sounds like you may have been killed by Triglavian NPCs? 
---
Sometimes pockets of hi-sec systems become "invaded" and roaming groups of Triglavians will patrol the systems. If you run into them on a gate in a slow ship with not a lot of defenses, they can make quick work of you. 
---
There's a setting in the map to highlight Invaded systems. Also, if you set a destination system you can tell which systems on your route as they'll be represented by an upside-down triangle instead of a square in your route overview (mid / upper left side of your screen).
---
Also - after revisiting the Kiki's damage numbers - I don't really 1vs1 much personally, so for me the consideration of using one is more considering a damage application role in a gang in general. I suppose it'd be worth a try but I'd have to apply free SP to fly the damn thing, not being mapped for Per/Wil.
---
You sound like me when I started. Run missions. I'd recommend Sisters of EVE missions since they have excellent LP Store rewards that you can sell for ISK. I personally spend all my LP on Sisters Core Probe Launchers as they sell for 30mil each and don't take long to get the LP for once you're running level 4 missions. Of course you'll be starting out with level 1 or 2 missions and working your way up as you can fly bigger ships for higher level missions. I started with this in 2012 and still use it for my primary ISK maker. Then I spend it all in PVP.
---
Dayuuum boi dun rekt them noobs
---
But dont i have to read your bio for rules
---
So you're saying this is CODE.'s fault?
---
Active armor tank with all that neutralization?
---
Cap booster dependent?
---
and it would be useless Goon just gonna turtle and hide their Titan just like WWB 1 you will never be able to kill their super even if you destroy all their keepstar they just gonna safe log off until the storm pass  
---
for that CCP should remove the tether, asset safety and a titan stay in space if log out  
---
soon they will bring the "docking" (don't know the exact word for that) when you will be able to hang your titan on a structure, i guess that what they want no more safety for supercap  
---
hilmar speak about a limitation for keepstar aswell (can't hold 2000super cap) could be great, if they everything i said WWB2 could be a reality &lt;3
---
Check the dryer
---
I detect some saltiness.
---
embrace the chaos

Lol this is to preempt the saltiness
---
hmmm, i was afraid of this

Do I need to learn to use the EvE API and plug that into my spreasheets in order to get this kinda of information, and how hard is that to do?
---
Why am I seeing only republic fleet adaptive nano platings on confessor fits on zkillboard and not adaptive nano plating II instead? Aren't they the same stats but much cheaper?
---
An instant ingame portal to r/eve? Sounds useful.
---
If you want more rewards for shooting structures;
---
Live. In. Wormholes. 
---
It's really that simple.
---
Not disagreeing here either. But wouldnt say easy on 20. And most dont do it. 
---
I wont disagree here either, Ive never been a fan of the new rorq.
---
Someone better report this murder of the chat server.
---
Well, it has been off for quite some time in null. It being broken should not have any effect.
---
Or it's isk you're after, run t5 abyssals on your keepstar undock while your pi shits money
---
Not quite. Wormhole systems have the same hidden infrastructure as New Eden, which is why there still is a local chat and why clone travel still works. Otherwise capsuleers wouldn't dare set foot there, lest their minds be lost forever. The fluid router network can still make connections from Anoikis to New Eden, because every wormhole system has a wormhole connection at any given time and because there is always at least 681 wormhole systems connected to New Eden at any given time.
---
The reason why Local doesn't auto-update with new users in wormhole space is related to the reason why it no longer auto-updates in nullsex. The unstable and randomly shifting nature of wormhole space means that supplies of Q-E He4 can take days or weeks to arrive and so fluid router stations need to conserve their supplies to ensure that high-volume capsuleer brain data can still get to stations in New Eden, as well as critical emergency transmissions.
---
Fantastic.
---
USTZ, test, assault frigs / random other light stuff, we take anything reasonable and we see all kinds of small gangs in south provi. We're around almost every night.
---
Miasmos -&gt; DST -&gt; Orca -&gt; Rorqual -&gt; Freighter.
---
As far as I know, exploration sites (in NS) will respawn immediately in a random system in the same constellation. The signature itself should disappear as soon as the site is finished, or at some point before that. Combat anomalies disappear as soon as you start the last wave.
---
Hunters are still using universe map/dotlan to find you via npc killed and jump data. Gotta blackout those too. Hunters don't wanna work though, incoming downvotes.
---
I have a legitimate question. Why do you say LegacyTESTImperium? That makes no sense. LegacyImperium would work for what you are saying, but TEST is in Legacy, so to also name them just seems off.
---
You really shouldn't sell moon goo on market. Hauling it in large quantities is an absolute pain in the ass and the market volume is really tiny so you end up selling it for far less than it is worth. Get someone to refine it and either react the products or haul them out.
---
There are more kills according null according to this.
---
OK
---
thats why you need scouting, to be sure *nothing* is happenning, and not that you're just missing the things.
---
You will instantly be podded when i start doing the worm.
---
I think we're at 46 now ?
---
Will have to check, thought.
---
Orcas aren't really useful out of highsec. They're just not tanky enough to survive anywhere else. In highsec they have enough tank to survive most casual gankers and with decent safety procedures you can avoid getting hit in one, but anywhere else they'll just fold like a bad hand. Even then, you shouldn't solo mine in them. Use them as support for alts in proper mining ships, since even with Augmented drones they're barely better than a barge and objectively worse than an exhumer.
---
That being said, if you're dead-set on mining in one then fit a full set of drone mining rigs (a pair of T2s and a T1), then tank everywhere else. Use a set of Augmented drones if you can since they're the best standard mining drones you can get (Harvester drones are absolute hot garbage that aren't worth their Excavator-level asking price. They're slow as hell and not really all that more effective than Augmented drones and they're an absolute magnet for gankers), or T2s if you can't.
---
But to be honest, if you can't bring any alts or can't train any into barges in the near future, and you're dead set on going solo, you're almost better off extracting those Orca skills and skilling into a Hulk.
---
I’m a hunter and I would love for those to blackout again. Spooky space is much more fun.
---
Im down for it being its fucked up state, dumb krabs going to log in assume systems blue because of the borked local and be far easier to find outside umbrellas
---
Yeah. Mining isn't something you do on your own, it's something to do to minimise direct capital outlays on industry, to help set up industry in a corp that doesn't do it, or if you're one of those weirdos who genuinely unironically enjoys mining above everything else (source: I am one of those weirdos). The IPH on mining is crap, unless you have a dozen alts running Rorqs in unlimited-respawning anoms in nullsex with an unassailable super umbrella hanging over you.
---
is that more or less than about wormholes?
---
Shit...
---
I think you might be a tad biased.
---
You were disturbing the peace. I am disappointed by the lack of space police.
---
Hey. Does anyone have a fit for the stabber that can solo lvl 3 missions or belt rat in null sec?
---
How much dps and ehp am I looking for in order to be able to comfortably belt rat or run lvl 3 missions
---
Otherwise maybe a gnosis fit that can run lvl 3 missions/belt rat if uve got one? I find the gnosis stupidly slow most my time is wasted travelling between missions though and I'm trying to shorten that.
---
Just a tad.
---
Cool, make the border of the area shrink and create battle royale in that area. Players will be rewarded by skins and lp to use in drifter shop based on their eanks
---
I spent an hour with chat changing system to system...seems legit
---
Losing doesn't have to mean not playing
---
If the argument is "I'm a sore loser, you better let me win" that's a poor argument
---
Both test and goons have lost before and they're the ones currently winning. I'm confident that pandafam will come out of the current conflict just fine
---
We have Defense roam every night in US time. I am based in n. provi.  If its a fight we remotely have a shot at winning we take it.
---

To add to this, not all time is equal. 10 extra minutes before I log off, or while we're grouping to fleet up, is essentially free time - as I wouldn't be spending it doing anything else profitable.

Not all actives scale the same with more time.

oof

I’m led to believe they care a lot about wormholes, but moreso in the “you can’t hate something unless you care about it” way.
---
&gt; What kind of lopsided advantage is having a handful of 2 man corps trolldeccing somebody going to give you?

You'll have different wars than you allies, meaning you won't be able to rep / boost fleet members not in your own alliance

---
Got kicked from Eve-U for undocking and losing my Domi during one of the frequent wardecs about 10 years ago when I started playing.  After a night out, I went to run L4 missions and got scanned down.  I knew there was a ban on it to not give them the killboard but alcohol...

Thanks for a straight answer.

That's beside the point, no alliance can be really hurt in this game. It's about getting more interesting content.

And no one hav the ball's to finish the job cause they all mates in the end.

If you don't stop posting your going back on dry food. No more fresh meat

NCPL were never that dominant but if you really believe this is all about who's "winning in Eve" you really missed the point.

Please stop. CCP turn the car around.

TAPI playing the drama lama victim role the past few years definitely score high points on the salty charts, but even that is completey irrelevant.

TIL keepstars only exist in null

I bet some of their veteran members are having flashbacks of the [RnK pipe bombing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95YDpd2ghz8).  Was a very enjoyable campaign against them.  Good luck in the coming weeks and enjoy!

I thought I was the only one who noticed all of null is just 4 active regions.

Thanks for no caps and no headshots. GF

Flashbacks to Junko's Stay Frosty
---
Not being able to rep/boost allies has nothing to do with who or who doesn't have you decced. That's just High Sec mechanics. They were changed so that Wardeccers couldn't have neutral logi/boosters that couldn't be attacked.
---
They should zap any ship that gets too close to a completely random point in kspace then collapse.
---
Issue is now they know exactly where to go, but if they do the moving anomalies (which would make adms.... insteresting) blacking out all of that data might lead to the ability to play again as a small guy
---
Big alliances will stay in their umbrellas, regions are large, and they’ll adapt... but the little guy cannot mine or rat for a day without every “elite pvp” group in existence seeing the light up on their map and grabbing their tent to head out for a camping trip.

No, no, no. As long as you *think* nothing is happening there's no need to spies. Just a waste of time to ^^hopefully confirm your suspicions.

I don't want to shit myself when I see multiple anons in system
---
I dunno, sounds like normal vindictive Eve stuff. Can't argue with that, at least you only barely played the tribal card. :-P
---
Still too soon to bring this up.
---
Orca's in high sec has it's place, if you want to do work/Netflix on another screen. Low imput, very scalable and your not always going to station to drop off or putting your lasers on rocks. Plus it doesnt take too long to train and you than can focus on something else you would like to train next. You could even be nice and boost solos. Orca's I think shine if you have hours to play afkish, just need to watch them more with the invasions/strongholds. If you do go with orca mining see if you can get a deal with someone that has athanor for moonmining, you could always ninja their ore but I would think more hassle than its worth. As for refining if you have less than perfect skills, you could join corp and usually someone is nice enough to do it for you until your skills are better.
---
They literally will not ever fix this. Years from now it will still routinely do this. Mark my words.
---
They don't have to fix the game if the game is dead
---
Touché!

Pretty fun for a while ey

Friggin microscopic...
---
Yeah I agree just see what happened to SLYCE and CO2. Oh wait they're with panfam now..
---
All of the three major nullsec entities defend it. They also just so happen to prevent others from keeping up similar trading citadels to earn money. Going to the TTT Keepstar is currently just as safe as going to Jita 4-4 at this point and you pay less + have tether.
---
That dank karma you could have gotten....
---
lol ok, fixed :P
---
Like you, most losses I have were avoidable in some way - no matter how small or large, almost every time I have died it was something I *could* have done something about if I'd known better.
---
In nearly every case, *dying* taught me more about things I didn't know than any other way I could have learned it.
---
I always expect I will lose ships - I fit them to be disposable, especially if I think I might be doing something particularly dumb. In all honesty, I don't lose ships too often - but keeping them cheap gives me the freedom to try dumb things and find out if they work without making me care too much when they don't.
---
For one of the more amusing dumb things I've done that work, I have a tristan that can do level 3 missions - not quickly - but it's caused quite a bit of laughter at times when doing missions shared with friends, they're lugging around a cruiser or battleship that's having to sit there and get hammered and my itty bitty frigate is zooming around aggroing all the things without a single shot connecting.
---
If I might pass a message along to the newbie in your corp, I'd like to tell them to not be afraid to try new things - it is *so much fun* when you make something work that looks impossible.
---
Shoutout to Ushra'Kan(RP lite) and Aideron robotics(teaches some industry too) as good FW corps with good history and people
---
I feel a bit demoralised by this :/
---
Try looking in the washer machine
---
Has it fuck.
---
No no, you just respawn in your home station in a new body. If you had implants those are gone but your skills remain the same. 
---
The reason they likely didn't pod you is you get a large sec status hit for podding someone in high or low sec. Only in null can you pod someone without the sec status hit. 
---
Eventually you'll get use to dying that it won't worry you so much. Then you'll kill someone and wonder if you could be the one killing people. Then you'll get better and maybe even good at fighting. Then you'll truly become one of us. 
---
Never be scared to lose a ship. You can always buy another.
---
CCP should just move back to the old system that worked until they can get the new one bug-free. Any reason why they shouldn't.
---
Also guess Im not logging in today.
---
Jita local is cancer. Be thankful
---
solid lol
---
Can confirm. I just started playing again with the Twitch Prime promo. I am basically a totally new player as that was in 2007. Everything has either changed or been forgotten.  That said, I do remember that even then Eve was “dying”, so it’s death throes must be absurdly long. :p
---
To anyone else experiencing this:
---
I think the problem is with Spectrum. I'm still waiting to hear back from them and CCP support. So, fingers crossed. If you are experiencing this issue too, try using a VPN. It seems to be working for me (after resetting my router and flushing DNS for a second time.) Note that VPN didn't work for me the first time I tried it.
---
Also, this website seems to exactly describe the problem, so give it a read:  [https://www.eveonline.com/article/pdd60q/current-connectivity-issues-and-troubleshooting](https://www.eveonline.com/article/pdd60q/current-connectivity-issues-and-troubleshooting) 
---
Hope this helps
---
The Ally system was set up specifically to benefit the defender. It's been like that for a while
---
Yup it was them. I diddnt know they swarmed the jump gates like that, so I thought that since I was passing through it would be fine. They took me out in two hits lol. I diddnt have much on the ship at least. I did get the warning about the invasion, but like I said I thought it wouldn't be too bad. Like what could possibly happen. Death...death happened lol
---
asset safety
---
Yeah, but it's still BS that you can have people on grid that can assist your enemy and that you can't hit. It's easily exploitable and it makes you lose people to misclicks. There's ways to make the system balanced in favour of the defender without giving them the possibility of free unlimited uninterruptible reps.
---
Tfw theres so little action 30 GSWF dropped on my Proc and took 8 mins to take me out :/
---
I sort of assume that if OP get what they want, it will involve different modules for PVP v. PVE. My knowledge of PVE fits for BCs is basically limited to shields and fits that are optimized for shield buffer and regen, with rigs chosen to complement modules that enhance that, while the PVP fits that I know of are more focused on rigging for resists and damage application. You lose the synergy between modules and rigs when you try to do double duty.
---
Also there's the whole "don't undock in anything you're not already prepared to lose" thing which is much more practice as opposed to theory when you undock to shoot players. While the risk to your mission boat from other players is much more theoretical, at least if you're not being dumb. If you can only afford one BC, and you want to use it for isk-making, you ought to dedicate it just to that and stick to smaller things when getting shot at by people, until you can afford another one to lose.
---
So this is why taxes are increasing.
---
"upset" is the word you use to describe holding water for five years, unfortunately
---
Meh I reddit for the memes and stirring up shit

No. Just no.

That you can have more than 1 per region is gross.

CCPls limit it to 1 XL per region 1 L per constellation

This diagnosis is so remote from reality that it's Not Even Wrong. I mean, you have to be in the same universe with Right to be Wrong.
---
The sandbox has produced status quo powers. That is why there are no big wars.
---
This event is bad and you are bad for sharing it.
---
Beautiful!
---
It's an older meme sir, but it checks out.
---
ccp does care a little actually, as much as to let a group of devs/volunteers/players do their thing
---
I didnt pay much attention to it, now I can troll local in systems in another region. It's kind of awesome
---
Lol
---
The issue I see is that it appears (and correct me if I'm wrong, my knowledge of highsec wardec mechanics is secondhand at best) that it's possible for defenders to have neutral logi/boosters that can't be attacked. Which I think we can agree is kinda BS.
---
I'm more than a believer that wardecs should favour the defender, no doubt about it. But this is straight-up BS that makes wars completely un-fun to engage in. If it works like that, which I'm willing to admit I'm wrong about.
---
Dear diary....
---
i mean technically efa oris isnt their biggest station, it is just where capsuleers decided to dump their stuff in
---
but anyway ccp tries to strike a balance between "muh immersion" and "how dare you penalize players for pvping!111!!!!" i guess
---
Dude, you're from *Krypted*. If *anyone* has lost the right to complain about that it's *you*.

Honestly, in an online game which previously had a fully functional chat system which supported thousands more concurrent active players then now in 2019....why **shouldn't** people remember the times it doesn't work.

You should get regional gate passes/credit for faction warfare and mission agents as not to punish people that work in HS on behalf of the empires.
---
But no, I don’t want couriers to get more expensive, I don’t want to haul my own stuff in and out of market hubs.
---
That's not how it works at all. Everyone that is complaining doesn't even know how it works. You can't rep or give boosts to anyone at war that is not in your corp/alliance. Boosts simply don't apply to them and if logi reps them with their safety turned off they will get Concorded.
---
...sigh
---
U can disable pvp mode in WoW.
---
Imagine being so poor you knew where all your Keepstars were.
---
You are incorrect. I explained it in another post. 
---
* Players that are not in your Corp/Alliance cannot receive boosts if they are at war, even if you are allies. 
---
* Logi cannot rep players in a war that are not in their corp/alliance. Green safety will prevent this, but if you turn the safety off you will get Concorded

---
No matter where I go I'm always in jita. Not sure how I feel about it but I'm starting to warm up to an isk doubling service
---
I guess you prefer being lied to (best numbers online since 2015 )
---
Like we could not check the data ourselves.
---
Or that the blackout was a “game feature “
---
I mean really what other lies are these piece of shits going to shove down our throats this time around.
---
Let me guess it’s all part of the chaos plan , it game design.... right!
---
This has me thinking that a step beyond this might be a "Question Broadcast" system, where the FC types any YES/NO question they want within a certain character limit, and can target it to any level of the fleet, from everyone to specific squads or individual members.
---
The broadcast appears in the normal broadcast window but with a exclamation point or something, with a YES/NO button next to it to give your answer. 
---
Three possible results: Yes, No, and Did Not Respond (seconds to timeout configurable).
---
Oh, you are very knowledgeable, at max skills a titan pilot is not 80m sp.

Yea but eve-radio isnt lol
---
Also do not use the same password for each account nor your email accounts.  If need be get a password manager.  Keepass XC is my favorite.  Its open source so you know it does what it says it does nothing more nothing less.  [https://keepassxc.org/](https://keepassxc.org/)  Also if you want to go extra step, Firefox gives you the option to containerize a tab. Which means its isolated from whatelse maybe going on and protects you alot better.   So opening random links is safter and good for things that require extra privacy like your bank, not your porn favorites list.
---
lol, the irony is I (a boy) used to scream like a girl until puberty and my voice got deeper
---
Yeah, I felt like Caldari was pretty noobish for so long.  Only ended up training it for nightmares and sadly for repping POS shields with chimeras.  Always avoided the drake since it felt so noobish and yet nanodrake ended up being one of my more favorite lowsec ships.  Also ended up with way too many tenjews for running escalations, watching gates, scanning, etc.
---
Sounds like you partake in what you are complaining about, the ganks in HS punish the inattentive, you get local, watch it.
---
Fights at your doorstep? Totally not a benefit....
---
Instead of bringing more PvP content to the game, you're content to "smash it" in your area, and then need to travel a number of jumps to find it elsewhere. PanFam doesn't have to travel because people know they can get fights in their space. Two different play styles at work basically. Like I said, a majority PVP Alliance vs a majority PVE alliance (as it pertains to the majority of linemembers' primary motivations I mean).
---
No way this is a bug. It’s annoying but not a bug they are messing with us

'Fog of war' - CCP CEO Hilmar
---
You dont want to pvp  we know this already, u are looking for free kills.  ;d
---
Jelly?
---
i love the meme where people think rmters will hack someones' account and then kill a ship with all of his assets/loot in it
---
you can straight up just transfer it to a character after a 10 minute convo basically pretending you're scamming him.
---
Send it to me, I will double these assets.
---
Last I checked we didn't have public data to show how many actual unique players are online, merely the ability to see how many characters are logged in. Did you stop to think that maybe the drop is from people who can't/won't run their massive multi-boxed fleets at the moment but that there has been an increase in people actually actively playing the game? Sure, a sub is a sub money wise in the short term but for the longevity of the game you're better off with more actual people behind screens. As a result I would guess that CCP is basing their player activity stats on the estimate of players rather than accounts.
---
Also, are you seriously trying to say that blackout is just a cover for the shit chat servers? I assumed that everyone was just memeing about that as it's been clearly laid out as an effort to make null more dangerous and/or unpredictable again. In fact the current chat server issues are actually partly removing the effect of blackout as local is actually being populated with people in null who haven't spoken (although generally in different systems to where you currently are but still).
---
Really I think you just need to ease off on the salt, CCP is actually trying to do something other than appeal to whales who want risk-free PvE in all parts of eve for the first time in years which has got a fair number of disaffected old players to resub which I can anecdotally confirm that I've noticed which apparently ties into the data that CCP has which shows an increase in old accounts becoming active since blackout happened.
---
TL:DR - Don't assume you have all the data just because we can read a PCU graph and stop being so salty.
---
Fair enough.
---
pls press button for me
---
./popcorn
---
that seems....really, REALLY optimistic.
---
I did get that number a bit low. The number should be 1,551, which comes from adding [this](http://anoik.is/systems?systemclass=barbican,c1,c13,c2,c3,c4,c5,c6,conflux,redoubt,sentinel,thera,vidette&amp;staticdest=hs&amp;effect=_unfiltered&amp;shattered=_unfiltered), [this](http://anoik.is/systems?systemclass=barbican,c1,c13,c2,c3,c4,c5,c6,conflux,redoubt,sentinel,thera,vidette&amp;staticdest=ls&amp;effect=_unfiltered&amp;shattered=_unfiltered), and [this](http://anoik.is/systems?systemclass=barbican,c1,c13,c2,c3,c4,c5,c6,conflux,redoubt,sentinel,thera,vidette&amp;staticdest=ns&amp;effect=_unfiltered&amp;shattered=_unfiltered).
---
You dont want to play eve we know this already u are looking for farmville. ;d
---
I see there's no point in talking to stupid.
---
Never?   It has not been working "fine" since the switchover 2 years ago.  Some days it works better than others, but there are almost inconsistencies, and it totally breaks a couple times a week at least.
---
好像很好玩
---
Thats like the worst case scenario. Rather have no local than to be stuck with Jita local.
---
Why are hk and lzhks  there? This was hole contro, holesale and Odin.
---
Cuz it would take actual work.  They basically said that when they promised (read: lied) to revert back if they couldn't fix this one.  CCP is allergic to work, and they have 10+ years worth of workaround code to prove it.
---
I mean, you can just fly around in space and see how empty it is.
---
How do you still not understand lmao
---
That number makes sense; I was wondering if we had another number on how many roaming KSpace-&gt;Anoikis wormholes exist at any given time. (Particularly given that if nobody scans down any of those 1551 holes across JSpace, they never K162 into KSpace...)
---
&gt;Concord seemingly does more to protect and enable gankers and ninjas than to deter them
---
Link lossmail
---
&gt;I suggest 10s on grid after ninja looting, and safely bypass disabled for alpha level ships
---
The former just sounds like you're upset about being ninja looted, either bring a PvP ship (you can fit a mining link on a BC) to shoot the people ninja looting (who will have suspect flags) or just don't jetcan mine. The latter makes sense at least but doesn't seem practical, since in my experience new players have no idea what the safety system is.
---
&gt;I'm saying this as someone who has ninja looted multiple officer modules in invasions too, there just isn't enough counterplay to high sec troublemakers right now.
---
There's plenty of counterplay. When you get ninja looted, they get a suspect flag which allows you to shoot them with no hassle from CONCORD. You can also use a mobile krab unit and/or not jetcan mine. Not to mention that, practically speaking, your chances of getting ninjaed are pretty low.
---
Also, you do realise you can summon CONCORD to grid at any time just by shooting an alt, right? They'll linger for a while, 2 hours if I recall, and will basically instantly evaporate anyone who tries to gank you, as well as summon reinforcements. If that's not safety I don't know what is.
---
Tears about ninja salvaging originally got me interested in this game. CCP nerfed that game play into the ground over the years, only giving it a small renaissance with the latest expansion. It is part of the Age of Chaos and I don't see why CCP would remove it after just adding it. 
---
But if you want to mix things up in highsec, I'm all for changing how crime works so you feel more comfortable  ganking them. That is another play style that has been essentially only nerfed and could use some love.
---
AFAIK we don't and can't. Besides the static holes, there isn't really a pattern to how wormholes appear, they just sort of do.
---
&gt;(Particularly given that if nobody scans down any of those 1551 holes across JSpace, they never K162 into KSpace...)
---
Yeah, there's not really a good lore explanation for that. I put that down as one of those things where game mechanics or limitations trump good lore. I suppose in the lore these connections always exist and the SCC/CONCORD has a method of scanning them down and executing a handshake between arbitrary fluid router connections.
---
A dependency? No thanks.
---
You of all people shouldn't be posting this statement.
---
It's one sentence. He said it between breaths.
---
While 0.9 belt has no rat spawn
---
It’s not just nullsec for explo sites. High low and wormhole space do the same thing (wormholes have constellations but it rarely comes into effect)

Very nice, but the decloaked astero just feels wrong.

I agree lol but it adds to the picture sorta lmao
---
hoyl fk
---
I would personally suggest a slight change, 2 XL per region and 2 L per constellation. 
---
But the limit being 1 Keepstar and 1 Sotiyo per region max, and 1 Fortizar and 1 Tatara or 1 Azbel max per constellation. As I cannot reasonably see CCP limiting alliances to one or the other when it comes to super caps. Though maybe anchoring the Sotiyo doubles/ triples the sovereignty bill the owning alliance has to pay for the region if a Keepstar has already been anchored in the region and vice versa.
---
That's a big paladin
---
If you feel better you can recruit a 7th guy and put him ina zarmzad
---
Thanks!  That's what I thought, but reading comprehension is hard.  I may have to grind Caldari Navy from 9 to 10.  :D
---
I don't see the lighter that surely will be Goons.
---
Capital ships being the fastest ships is a game breaker. If they refuse to fix it, there is no point in playing since it kills most content.
---
Meh it’s a dumpster dread with a dumpster fit. It’s not worth anything...
---
Use a cynabal or vigilant if you can afford it
---
Meh
---
Calling someone stupid is so mature. You are just a risk averse player calling urself pvper.
---
And even when the result is in, they refuse to acknowledge the problem. Standard CCP.
---
Concord definitely does not protect gankers.
---
Concord will stay on grid until sommuned elsewhere in the system or downtime.
---
First gank after downtime Concord almost instantly spawns instead of "warping".
---
Pulling isnt that hard

Thank you, spread the word.

---
And yes you can just go fly around to see that there is less people playing , I can just look at activity in my Corp and alliance , it really doesn’t take a genius to see that actual players are down.
---
And that we are being lied to.
---
I for one do not appreciate being lied to.
---
Ive been thinking the same ever since the implimentation of the new chat system. But given the lazy approach to Blackout, I think youre hoping for the moon on this one. Hopefully CCP proves me wrong.
---
Looking at EVE Offline, we had 1600 fewer online this friday than last. Ofcourse, its summer and all that jazz, plus, yesterday chat channels were all dead for a while, so that will ruin the statistics, but it wont help the impression from people that are sceptical of Blackout on a general basis.
---
Exactly!

damn you, i had to go loot ammo lol
---
Sabre died op success
---
No problem :)
---
I did momentarily lock a sabre, but immediately re-tethered after de-locking. Didn't de-tether again until fleet was on grid with me proceeding to de-tether to neut bhaals.

yikes

what did GOTG do at UALX?

mmm friendlies can still scout you out easy

If your mind thinks a shield chemosh is better then armor i dont need to change your mind, you just need yours fixed.

Have a look at https://forums.eveonline.com/t/spreadsheets/44424/4

There's lots of examples you can copy/paste and base your work on.

I replied to a comment stating they weren't there. That was a lie, they were there.

To answer you question, not that much. Kind of like the PL titans that landed out of position and couldn't properly DD.

Hint:

* Build an interceptor with hyperspatial rigs.           
---
* Take LVL1 mission before DT in the same system with rats directly at warp in                    
---
You can do this &lt;8s if the mission is without the gate.
---
I work in a factory that has Internet aware win xp machines in the dozens on the single network everything is connected to

imagine not knowing what a pulsar is
---
\&gt; How I lost my first Chemosh
---
\&gt; Shield Chemosh
---
Yeah, that's how you lose a Chemosh, alright.
---
well personally i simply think it would be nice and shit if i’m ratting at all i put eyes on gates so i knooow if sneaky shits comin
---
We live in a pulsar and said pilot is a bit um... special
---
I give my vote for lowsec gate to stain. Another shit to bring more people to log in\*, again so cheap ccp... . First they backstab playerbase and now trying to fix it with low lvl magic.
---
hehe sure.. or those who knew didn's post cus it wasn't post worthy..
---
Because the north doesn’t play long term, they just do whatever is fun at the moment. It was just a coincidence that creating a new player friendly alliance for recruiting would give them a powerful ally in the long run.
---
The one morning I have a lie in....
---
Well, not as of a few months now, but the responses I get are too funny to pass up.
---
It happens lol
---
nobody is completley unimportant to me &lt;3
---
Well you guys were complaining about no local is bad bc you can’t be social. Now you get to interact with multiple systems now
---
Tried to get in touch with Tuzy? Im pretty sure he was one of those duders....
---
I can look at the activity of your alliance ([this July has the most kills on record](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/498125261/stats/)) and corp ([where July had anupswing in kills over the preceding 4 months](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/1218670486/stats/)) too and they don't match your assessment. Also they didn't just "turn local off" they took the existing mechanics of local chat in wormhole space and applied it to null sec.
---
Suitonia does a good job showing the relative PvP activity levels compared to last year[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ckskep/the_most_vibrant_concern_trolling_of_the_past_5/)
---
i mean.. if hes FRT, he got all of legacy attacking, and they will call daddy goon for timers on the regular, and between legacy and imperium a majority of null is indeed out to kill him, no?
---
Most important comment so far.
---
Did capital neuts get changed so they can neut smaller stuff now? Before the target needed a sig off 4k or something for them to do anything really.
---
High sec provides too much income. Abyssal and burners should be restricted to low/nullsec. Give people a damn reason to leave.
---
I'm guessing he was going for max sustained sucking power.
---
And I'd argue he succeeded: the fit definitely sucks.
---
There's also a solo kill. Someone from CODE solo-killed a Goon Proteus in a Porpoise. Let me repeat that: someone from CODE was flying a mining ship. This is such a bizarre thing that the entire rest of that incident is non-weird by comparison. [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77977156/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77977156/)   
---
Also. If you d-scan a bunch of Procurers on an Athanor in LowSec, you're going to either need a good-sized fleet [or some of the most beautiful words that you can hear as late-game protoss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vj37yeQQHg) in order to handle it. They're tanky drone combat ships that also have mining laser bonuses. They're not easy targets like the other barges.
---
Im aware of pulsar effects. Given what was on him id still take the pepsi challenge of active armor. Looking at his damage taken.
---
Not that i know his specific pulsar effects because i dont care.
---
Guys I think he crashed his car looking at fits
---
'had' being the key word here
---
Then make sure your email has 2FA as well, I have several gmail accounts an they make it very easy now, never have to deal with it on my home PC and work laptop.
---
If your email is not 2AF than using 2FA on other things can be bypassed.
---
Working as intended.
---
What a character name.
---
also gate should spawn permanently...
---
but CCP doesn’t care, so many posts about abyssal pvp and no answer from ccp at all
---
The trouble makers are the ones making high sec not completely safe and makes it more interesting, those little rascals are teaching people life lessons. What high sec mission runners only have to worry about gankers and suspect pilots if they engage, oh and the ones that die to npc's. I honestly love the frigate guy/girl that flys around baiting miners and then you have the orca that gets mission/miners to engage them...when they do the orca person has 5+logi characters to come and rep the orca. High sec I don't think was meant to be completely 'safe.'
---
Comparing kills doesn’t mean there is more people logged on it just means there is more pvp going on .... seriously 😒
---
i thought you meant pandemic horde
---
because
---
And also adding wh space local to null sec is hardly a feature or a “new game design “
---
It a cop out , the dev says going back to classic Eve is a cop out but using wh space local isn’t ?
---
I trust local less than cheap gas station sushi.
---
At least you learned something! 
---
It's random chance that they were on the gate, but in the future you can try equipping extra buffer tank (shield extenders) or mods that help you align and enter warp faster (inertial stabilizers).
---
you were talking about "activity" PvP is one of the better metrics for measuring that, your counter point is that you have a gut feeling that you have seen less people around doing stuff with no evidence backing it up (bringing me back to the point that we don't have access to all the data CCP does). Also, logged in doesn't mean active as you can just be afk in a station but still logged in but you'll struggle to be afk and PvPing.
---
Get the ballad of Chasey Lain on Falcon and enjoy his true inspiration.
---
I support the limiting of Intel that's sourced from API's, make hunters actually hunt.
---
If you’re into mining, doing it in hi-sec is probably the only plausible activity that doesn’t have a huge increase in risk from disconnects.
---
Hilmar lives in a wh somewhere . I am sure of that.
---
Just flying through the rancer pipeline in general
---
If you don't know ISK is also Icelandic currency, aka "Iceland Krona"
---
The neuts applied fine to out bhaals, but unfortunately they were full nos fit
---
Was just a grunt, but we were pausing the citadel regularly, and i think part of the idea of using the 3 blobs of fleets was fighter screening off each other. But eagles can't apply for shit to fighters up close. I think we paused the timer 5 times or so? But then the fighter swarm bears down, we switch to them and maybe kill off a few squads, and in return lose another logi or links. It was really well played by defence, fighter control was on point as well.
---
I don't think you understand how some things work
---
This dread is only meant to be flown in his home, a pulsar wh, wich significantly reduces armor resists and increases shield hp.
---
Garbage of the Galaxy is no go after they joined forces with Goons in Tribute, duh.
---
It is is true, this idea us around 2 years late. You should have done that, when you pushed TAPI in Goons' hugs you cocksalads! Not be surprised piccachus when Tapirium could kick anyone's butt now, no matter how bad their average pilot is.
---
Pssshhhh
---
Well Horde has more subcap pilots than NC and PL (RiP) combined. Also their supers numbers are going yo be more pretty soon.

High sec is to  secure, CCP wants to shake things up little...
---
I can see my Corp and my alliance and fly in space see for myself, I’m not the only player saying there is less people playing but whatever man.
---
I mean us time zone we have 15 k online during peak hours  during the week , if that’s acceptable for you which it seems like it’s fine to you 
---
 .so be it , 
---
if it drops to 10 k maybe I get to tell you I told you so.
---
And also I was talking about my  Corp mates and alliance folks and avg player online playing eve not just pvp kills , of course blackout is going to cause more pvp because its being forced down our throats.
---
I’ve done more pvp in a week then I do in a month but just like anything else you do it to much it gets boring and old quickly.
---
If you want to sit here and ignore the fact that I can see in my standing fleet we went from 220 + an extra standing fleet to 120 ish single fleet and justify it by more pvp kills then , sure go for it please keep at it I only hope it keeps deteriorating so it can show in the company bottom line and they just finally fire the dumb wits running the show at CCP.
---
I can’t wait to see them gone.
---
Pearl Abyss is all about the profits and if CCP is full of shit,
---
 it’s going to show come quarterly earnings.

If not then I stand corrected.

But profits doesn’t lie. Bottom line money doesn’t lie.

They've certainly discovered the surest path to victory.
---
Have more ships on-grid than the enemy. Have enough of an industrial backbone to recover lost ships faster than the enemy. They don't need to win battles. They just need to grind people down.

Rolled into their home, found low power fort. Shot the fort with small fleet to bait a fight. Reffed fort as they undock dreads including chemosh. Couple dreads warp to different structures to try and warp back in on us to fight. Chemosh warps to nearby reitaru. We follow and start trying to bump him off. Rest of enemy caps land, staggered a bit by bubbles. Chemosh starts neuting our bhaals so we engage their fax. Once fight is going we jump in a dread we had been running around trying to fit. Dread and subcaps manage to kill fax, then poor chemosh is all alone without a tank and unable to tether because hics.
---
 Better?

---
Woah now... They managed to kill a basi too
---
Depends on the day
---
True. How about next we make CONCORD have a 0.1% chance of not helping you lol (no)
---
Could take you to an endless dungeon, with a wave counter, first wave being a single frigate and then increasing by one each time, the only real goal is seeing how many waves you last before being blown up, you always lose your ship and then the sleepers/trig's/jove who ever it is kicks your pod back out into a random k space system, give the player x amount of loyalty points based on how many waves they lived through before being killed, and don't limit the ships, allow everything from a frig to a titan in since its 100% going to die.
---
I id take some ships in there for loyalty points providing the store had some good rewards to make it worth while.
---
haha saw that too
---
They had ultra cta fighting with legacy, fire and imperium. Meanwhile we were reffing their timers.
---
Sounds like you guys had a fantastic time!
---
U wot m8
---
Lol muh kbstats

Waaa ? It’s all game design, wh local being used in null is not a cop out and the bugs is “chaos era”

And online players are out the roof ! (Not)

If the Proteus is dual rep with a republic large battery, the stratios pretty much can't win unless he brings quite a few friends. Best case scenario, he has to disengage after realizing he can't even tickle the Proteus. If the Proteus is shitfit/bad pilot, then stratios can win surprisingly easy.

okay what you're gonna do is

With max speed skills and tripple T2 drone nav's in your mids, on a rock that is 1300m radius, it will take your drones 10s to get back to your rorq assuming you're sieged up at or less than 100m from the rock. It takes bombs 12s to get to your Rorq and detonate. This makes most of the anom unmineable with excavs, less you risk getting them bombed.

It's a huge change form when I first joined up way back when. We basically only had 2 systems. A ratting system, and a PvP one. A2- (?)
---
And, no, Horde doesn't have caps... just really big ratting VNI's. Well, Domie's now.
---
Better have some Xenotime :thinking:
---
they can even keep the Chat off

Right mouse click when in doubt.

Just look at the number of corpses ?!! Maybe the Drifters had something to do with all of this.

Yes since 2003 bud

It was fine for a while then this bug has returned.

Any more "notes" bud? Do you really think this was anything more than a fun distraction from the actual war we've been fighting for months? It was a fun fight between brothers. It's not like we were ever going to pull apex doctrine away from the front lines and into HS. Can't it be enough that it was an enjoyable scrap?
---
Solo?  Your only hope at industry making a profit will be battle procurers in null.

Otherwise find a group... it’s the only counter to blops and bombers right now

Be baity. Let someone come to you. They can't look you up on zkill until they land on-grid with you.

I love when these kind of fights happen in lowsec. I wish I've seen them happening more often.
---
I mean, in all fairness, some will hunt blind, some will hunt with blue spies.
---
I will just put on my "wizard hat" for a second, to pitch my point of view.
---
Im a large scale trader, and saw the direct impact of the Blackout on the market instantly. With Blackout, ratting/activity dropped off a cliff, which impacted the market quite a bit too. Then, after a few days, people picked up the ratting/activity a bit again, I guess due to people just giving it a shot out of habit.
---
Now, coupled with chat/local issues, and the realisation that Blackout is a permanent AND Hilmar/Falcons hint that asset safety is a potential target; people either move to big unbrellas (TEST, Goons, PanFam) or High sec. The activity has taken a new nosedive based on Dotlan, and the metrics I read off market.
---
Providence was built around the "Deliverance Project" style of play, NRDS, which obviously almost depends on local intel, due to there are alot of neutrals that mind their own buissness. Most of the players have tried other parts of the game, be it NBSI, as part of smaller or large NBSI entities, but enjoy the Sim City of NRDS as something to do. The intrest seems to have vaned tho, since no local strongly impedes a vibrant "Deliverance Project", and as Boat pointed out in a Metashow, most alliances/blocs can fit in 1 constallation. That has become much more true with Blackout.
---
I understand what Hilmar/Falcon is hoping for, but again I agree with Boat, Blackout is a cop-out change vs a true delayed local.
---
yeah, goons really fucked them up
---
Skill plan: don't just do the Magic 14. Mix in skills for the ships that you want to fly, but eventually train them all to V. If you just do the Magic 14, you'll have a slight advantage to everything but you'll be able to do nothing well.

Suggested corp: EVE University.  [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying\_to\_EVE\_University](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying_to_EVE_University) 
---
We have an introduction to everything. Other corporations might go deeper into one or two elements of the game, but no other corp will give you as broad an exposure to a wide variety of aspects of the game and encourage you to try everything to figure out what you like to do (before generally moving on to a corp that specializes in it). If you want to learn what it's like to do stuff in a particular area of space, the Uni will get you started in that area of space.
---
PvE with badass ships? Incursions. That's what Incursions are about: killing Sansha NPC's with big, badass battleships. There's a high starting cost, but talk to the E-Uni Incursions dudes and they'll probably be able to help you get started once you've trained the relevant skills.
---
High-Sec Campus and Amarr Mining Campus are the dedicated PVE campuses (although a lot of PVE fleets stage out of HSC, particularly the frigate blob fleets intended for newcomers). Since you're interested in doing stuff other than mining, I'd recommend checking out HSC first. AMC is quite nice and I like people, but mining and industry is their main focus, There are PVE mission fleets out there, but they don't happen as often as HSC and there aren't as many ad-hoc mission fleets up. HSC's home system has two L4 mission agents with Garoun Investment Bank, so people usually just tag along with mission fleets until they have the standings to pull L4 missions from GIB, then pull missions either for mission fleets or to solo with a battleship. The next system out is a 0.5 system with a lot of moons where the people there typically generate ISK that doesn't come from missions. Because mining is actually pretty fun when you do it with the most important ship in the game, the friendship.
---
Small gang  and solo PVP? E-Uni has that. Low-Sec Campus. LSC isn't really as active as other campuses because it's still getting set up in its new location with new management. PVP, its primary focus, is an ISK-losing activity, but LSC is in the process of setting up a substantial PVE schedule of both mining fleets and PVE combat fleets. If you really like this area of space, you're probably a good fit to move on to a faction warfare corp afterward.
---
Interested in Null-Sec (without sovereignty and with very rare use of capital ships because of diplomatic issues)? Null-Sec Campus. Syndicate is a fairly empty region of space, so it's relatively safe. But there's some pretty good mining and PI (Initiative owns a lot of the best nearby stuff, not to the same degree as Outer Ring), with people going out for PVP fairly often. Doesn't always happen in Syndicate (in fact, it's generally one or two regions out), but it's pretty fun PVP. Not the crazy-big Null-Sec wars that you hear about in non-game-specific news, but fun PVP.
---
Project Solitude is the one that I have the least experience with in K-Space (despite having a jump clone over there). Solitude is a region of High-Sec cut off by a decent amount of Low and Null. So these guys tend to be doing stuff on their own most of the time, occasionally bringing stuff in with the DST and JF schedule. For this reason, they seem to have a solid sense of community, with a similar PvE focus to HSC and AMC but with a bit more teeth because to get anywhere else, they need to be able to go out and be ready to be shot at. They're the main thing keeping that region's economy running.
---
Wormholes? The Wormhole Campus is a great place to get started. It's a C2 with a High-Sec static connection, so it's more accessible than where the hardcore wormholers typically live (although their holes tend to have a lot more ISK to farm), making it less challenging to get started. If you like that sort of playstyle, you could move on to a dedicated wormhole corp.
---
I recieved a message saying I had won first place due to team spirit and small gang bravery. I have no idea who got 2nd and 3rd places though and would love to know or hear an update? Anyone else get a message saying they did?

---
nullsec has these things called ihubs and adms
---
and the infrastructure that goes into them is specifically to allow players. with great effort:.: to be able to have a better alternative than npc stations which, once upon a time were deemed obsolete and toxic because they were invincible
---
and they existed in null too.  Let’s not bring that back.  you kill a staging cit you can kill several hundred billion in reclaim fines as is
---
It can’t just be that NRDS is causing Provibloc to dock up though. Because Provibloc is only half the content in Providence, HTP/TRC/TRU provided a lot of good fights too. But they are all docked/tethered too now.
---
Bei patient
---
When I need to field it. (Never)
---
Random feature idea... a spatial "rift" that will send you to a random system. Any system (not jove space). No capitals (or even frigates only) and every ship goes to a different randomised location...
---
\&gt;blobbing
---
don't you mean the brave heroes of tapi fighting outnumbered against the rest of EVE?
---
Im sure HTP/TRC etc have noticed that there is nothing to shoot, since those that bothered to do large fleets that give expensive killmails has gotten bored with Blackout. I both killed and lost billions in capitalfights with HTP/TRC etc, and I dont mind. As a trader I can sustain losses :) But if Blackout is such a success there should be plenty of roamers around to keep the killmails coming for you or others. I guess not..?
---
But when what you find entertaining/instresting (Deliverance) is sort of shutdown, people pick up other games that entertain, or actually enjoy summer for a change. "NRDS causing Provi to dock up". No not really. Just intrest seems to have vaned so much that people dont even log in, or moved to safer areas.
---
Just looking at the game as it is now, for Deliverance to actually work now, you need to put everyone in Providence into 1 or 2 constallation(s), to have good response and intel.
---
Yeah i always found it strange that oposing militia just roams freely and kills people in their home highsec space...

My recommendation would be to clone jump up to high-sec and do Abyssal sites. Maybe ninja mine somebody's high-sec moon belt, or something. - It's what I've been doing when I'm not in the mood to be on comms and all that.
---
Solo mining and ratting in null is just kind of pointless during the blackout. Might as well just self-destruct on the undock. Save yourself time.
---
Well, figure it the fuck out.
---
It's not that hard. Somehow you made it this far.
---
There are already loads of guides if you just google
---
Not you, mate. PanFam leadership.
---
All of you bittervets can't see the big picture anymore and only focus on your own enjoyment. HS is where all the new players are trying out the game. It should not be this easy to suicide gank someone in HS. Right now you can kill anyone with catalysts and still be ISK positive even without looting. It is a paradise for the scum like CODE. and PIRAT. And then you wonder why the player retention rate is so low.

Because the old system DIDN'T support more players the very reason they moved it to cloud AWS is because the chat system was a big part of what broke the servers during big fights.

I was on grid all I saw was: warping in, shooting a few shots then immediatelly warping out, next fleet comes doing the same.
---
Agreed gotg should too have deployed like skillu and others. But still they joined for many timers. Saying gotg is responsible for co2 death is retarded. Theres much more context around that event.

Whats the relation between you and GOTG? You seem rather....I dunno...fanatical maybe?

TBH it started with Horde and Goons on grid (TEST were late for some reason). We didn't leave grid at any point during the fight, just pinged around the citadel (azbel?) to try and keep chipping away. It was a big fighter swarm though and damn the MWD cooldown on them is fast (as we would ping up to one spot, then warp to the opposite side and they would be able to be on top of us pretty rapidly. Blapped a lot of fighters but not enough.
---
They should at least delay dotlan by a hour or something.
---
This is true.  I would actually say 99.9%.
---
And we've had chat issues ever since the  new implementation which was sold as being better than the old.
---
\&gt;completely ignoring the fact that before the change it was working for 10 years 99.5% of the time

Well, if we look at history, SNUFF's word is better than Goon's... At least we only broke our twice. Unlike mittz legendarily constant rewritings of history and blamings of former allies for his own wrongdoings. I have no idea what "repitation" you are talking about, as goons' only diplomatic repitation for the last decade is "never trust goons". And I am aware that when one is actually engaging in diplomacy with yours - the result is exactly the same as anyone engaging in diplomacy with us - agreements. To either fight or not to fight. Which both you and us do actually follow through - our own stunt in imperium for example. However I do not get it why "hey let shoot at each other for fun" is viewed by you like some sort of bad thing. Or something complicated. It really isn't. Like two spoken sentences between people who manage them, then like three clicks of a mouse. Done. Getting into a fleet and undocking is harder than that.
---
\&gt;what do i do if there is no one online when I play?
---
join a group that is online when you play
---
join a group with more TZ coverage
---
go out and make your own content
---
if there are no people- rat
---
if there are people- fight them
---
99% uptime is actually quite crap for most web services.
---
To put it into context. EVE's official "up time" is 23h 45m per day (15m expected downtime). In a 30 day month, that's a total of 712h 30m of up-time. - Assuming your 99% up-time (or rather: 1% downtime) that's just over 7h of downtime per month.
---
Which we could probably expect in the form of one long day of severe chat failures. Or, perhaps, several days with lesser, yet still irritating, failures. Either way the chat system would not feel at all stable to anybody using it.
---
And its gonna be the best keepstar you've ever seen believe me, people ask me all the time about our keepstars, they do and i give them great answers.
---
The anti panfam in test is bad enough that they’d rather see the game die then work with panfam because of the “wWb BeTrAyal” and the like. Most of them haven’t even ever interacted with panfam or where around during the time this occurred they just proxy hate them because the older Test guys that are still around spout stupid rhetorics. 
---
So they’d rather see 500 strong titan fleets from GSF and 200-300 from themselves and have them rot in a keepstar somewhere until they get bored and start having to make up some content somewhere and sit there and talk about how Panfam did this and that they “drove us to GSF” and the like. Basically they’d rather watch the game die and stagnate harder than it already has then be part of the crew that frees it.
---
It might be an idea to at least update https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/203218962-Broker-Fee-and-Sales-Tax
---
So much about making the game easier for new players. I knew the change was coming because of lore announcement and hoboleaks. Even noticed directly after DT because of hoboleaks. The casual player doesn't do that. Again the casual player loses.
---
Well, they could start by importing market data from Tranquility. Then running special market-only tests.
---
quit being shit.
---
well, not all can do such low effort to protect Renters/ people in CE like HK. Wise choice to get Panfam involved in Important stuff to cockblock us, so it wouldnt escalate in a "war". I think Gangolf choose the word "war" here, because trying to describe the current situation would have gone beyond the allowed title-length :)
---
"war" is used to here as eyecatcher/clickbait its more like a bit toasting and skirmishing. Would have been more intresting if HK didnt change timers from EU to US when we started :P

Lock 5 rocks, and spread your drones out to maximize uptime.  Otherwise you will be back every 2 seconds with a rock pop.
---
I've been actively shopping for one of these for a couple weeks now. Thanks for fucking up the market for me.
---
And I should add; I think even if CCP reinstate local DT today, I think the damage is permanent. People have moved on, and it will take months to get the neutral population back to Providence.
---
The total EVE population is lower than x years ago, so every person that leaves any given region, is more impacting than it used to be.
---
that implies local in hs was fixed, it was not.
---
Yes. Make nullsec dangerous
---
This would be awesome.
---
Can't a fellow look for friends without being told not to?  :(
---
Snuff did most of the work really.
---
no one wants to spin plexs because the hard work of legit pilots is undone by a few bots in the au timezone. a real shame because plex warfare is some of the best content. i always looked down on the bads fighting fuckin shuttles in hs

They die in hisec just as easily.  Noone flys them anymore.

I laughed. Reading replies I laughed more
---
Are you on crack? Goons don't break diplomatic agreements. Someone has lied to you if you believe otherwise. Go crawl back into your hole, you obviously don't know what you are talking about.
---
Once you set it up you only need to authenticate your client and web browser once, then again on any new device.
---
But why use TEST separately? Or can you not read?
---
I knew a guy that worked for a government contractor, he had a fob with his keys that showed a 6 or 8 digit authentication number when you pressed it's button.
---
You can get them for your bank accounts, but now they just text you the number when you login, that is more convenient for most people.

"bunch of hookers annd cocaine"
---
That farm hole to my understanding is only owned by a
---
* All neutral and hostile citadels in controlled space will be put into low power.
---
* Remove missions.
---
* Make D-plexing not be affected by LP gains from tiers.
---
* Reduce LP gain from tiers.
---
* Increase LP gain from system flips and ISK destroyed.
---
* LP gain for killing neutrals in FW space that scales from negative security status\*isk destroyed. Makes sense you would defend your faction's space against pirates.  
---
EZ. But nooo, muh missions and LP for the newbies (not bots, farmers and input broadcasters btw). Any good corp will hand out ships so newbies won't be crippled by losses. They'll also provide doctrine ships for ops. If a corp isn't doing that then it's shit and they should find a better one.
---
Use DDU to uninstall graphics drivers and make fresh driver installation. If doesnt help you laptop is probably already broken.
---
My firetail vs their hookbill and rifter. Hookbill got away in hull, rifter was killed and podded (mg halos),

You should take some low sec gates while things are messing up, might end up in Stain.
---
Can you also guess which type of ship?
---
In your mind, Fountain is "safer"?
---
How about:  
---
Have a titan in front of a structure, cyno burning in anomaly.  
---
Undock -&gt; Bridge -&gt; kill
---
Just to make this clear...
---
1 AU/s is about 540C (540 times the speed of light)
---
1 AU is the distance between the sun and the earth, and the light takes about 8 Minutes to get here (around 300.000 km/s)
---
Ramping difficulty. The longer you stay in a site the more loot you can squeeze out of it, but the more dangerous it becomes. Think final room of a Superior Sleeper Cache (speaking of which, sleeper caches need a buff and exploration needs progression).
---
Havens and Sanctums could use webs and/or better application, or to have loot be picked up (even just one can at the end of the site) to reduce the effectiveness of 100mn cheese and pre-aligned ships.
---
Is this the only thing you've got in your spank bank?
---
That farmhole you're talking about is owned and run to my understanding by one person. This guy while knowing prom irl did not do any of the planning from what I know, but due to his relationship with prom left pospy in order to take the blame off us. 
---
As far as I'm concerned the owner of that farm is still a friend to me. I remain friends with many different people from many different corps for both obvious personal reasons and that it can be a source of content to my people. 
---
Obliminal in that screenshot bought off those structures after your eviction ended at a bulk discount and flipped them for profit.

No, but I noticed my screen needs a good cleaning

---
Except that list wasn't accurate. Thanks for your input.
---
This is actually a pretty good explanation. Don't bots rely heavily on local?
---
Spot on.
---
I remember when lumpy+just let it happen+wombat were living in Tenal there were frequent fights in Cobalt. 
---
Outnumbered they fought a good fight,  but eventually gave up  and then handed Tenal over without a fight to NC that made it Rental space.  I never understood that.
---
So recently, during the Tribute war,   wombat decided to haggle wich group would hire them and they handed Tenal over to gotg/RR wich apparantly has less use for it now with the blackout.  
---
As for Panfam's involvement,  i would argue it has less todo with cobalt, more todo with tenal/gotg.   Gotg space cycles through more alliances then any other coalition, so i guess we shall see that put to the test soon?
---
it's a bit maller like
---
Super umbrella mostly.

Also the ability to very easily keep track of events happening in the budget space between empires.

Nowhere else has such buffers.

You should find the network diagnostic thing in the Eve launcher and click the traceroute button there; that should output a trace that your ISP’s tech can use to troubleshoot, I’m not sure if secure.eveonline.com is the login seever or not.
---
This sort of thing can happen due to ISPs or their carrier/s doing routine cleanups or changes to their Internet routing tables, so if the only thing you can’t reach is Eve Online, odds are Spectrum’s other customers can’t either.
---
They mean they want to shoot ratting carriers and rorquals without being dropped on. =P
---
Sit a fleet on it. Cloak sabres there and wait. Bait them with something. I could think of more but it’s not my staging
---
When your carrier gets killed when you are afk and tethered
---
Eve and rust seem to go a lil bit hand in hand. Must be all the bloodthirsty savages...
---
you dont have to hate us to shoot at us.
---
why so rude ?
---
Instead of our alliance being thrown together with a bunch of corporations that kinda like doing the same - or if lucky operate in the same space, our alliance's structure is build towards unity.  
---
We don't accept corporations to the alliance, instead we founded our own corporations, all running under the same name.   
---
The only difference is the profession those corps specialize in.
---
We have our industry, we have our navy, we have our foundation. (Intelligence and Guard corporations to come).
---
This allows people no matter the playstyle (except Wormholers btw.) to feel at home and play their favorite playstyle while having  
---
* **A:** A purpose. The Navy builds ships, modules, full doctrines for our Navy, while our Navy protects our industry and pays 10% of the production cost. It's a win-win.  
---
* **B:** Everyone can just swap playstyles if they wish to. You like to mine stuff and want to go for a PvP roam? Of course you can. Like to shoot stuff and want to go mining? Definitely!  
---
   
---
We want to get rid of that "We only do one thing hardcore" mentality and allow people to have fun and do their thing with a group of like minded people without excluding them from other activities. We're not a "we-do-kinda-everything"-corp without structure.   
---
Each corp has their own fully established infrastructure, monthly goals, roles and jobs, leadership and ambitions.  
---
Another thing: We're still building our Empire and our Roadmap is split into different phases. We reached 300 members in under 3 months who all want to participate in our cause.   
---
Instead of striving for Null-Sec, we'll move to Low-Sec as we don't want Null-Politics to come or have to mind-numbingly fight for our SOV all the time.
---
Instead of just "rushing to low and see what happens" we're preparing our people for the move to low in High-Sec.   
---
We even want our Miners and Carebears to be able to defend and conquer when we call to arms so we can have every last man fight for our cause.   
---
In the end, we might not be the most PvP'able corp at the moment, it's true our Killboard doesn't look good and that's always a critique.  
---
I personally don't care, we've ruined it endless times for internal corp pvp sessions where we gave out free ships, assigned roles to our members, formed two fleets and bashed each other in multiple PvP-Training sessions now.   
---
This way we could even motivate the most hardcore industrialist to grab a free ship and lose it like a pro!  
---
We're trying to build an environment for all people to become happy in and play the game the way they want to.  
---
We all stick together closely, even in High-Sec it already feels like a family who all work together for a common goal.   
---
PvP guys help out our industrialist and the PvP guys get to know some new techniques of how to make some ISK at the side.   
---
Also, propaganda: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGYo794s2L4
---
I just want to make sure you understand this and not just salt over something you have no experience with.
---
The newer Tax changes cut a third YES, ONE FUCKING THIRD, from a traders profit.
---
In the long term, the market will just adjust, we are, even now starting to just increase items in their price to keep our margin.
---
Just increasing the taxes is not the way to make stuff cheaper, that can only be achieved by reducing the amount of isk beeing generated by activities like ratting and mining, stuff that is basically printing money
---
This goes especially mining, wich can generate billions with basically no effort (see people with afk Rorqual fleets)
---
It's not the industry that was/ is the problem, because that is something where a lot has to be invested first
---
The margin for most building and selling most cruisers is owed than 1mil isk, and now you want to just make another fee, that takes even the last bit away.
---
We'll just make it more expensive
---
Where are you finding fights where you have time to reload paste during a 3v1
---
There are two types of corps in Eve. Those that have me and those that don't...
---
The E version of "Spot the Ball"
---
\*facepalm I hate down voting.
---
So that’s why you bought all those corpses :0 ~Fox
---
Nice shot, but Asteros look unnatural uncloaked :p
---
Perfect intel due to instant local chat, giving way to creating intel aggregators like NEAR2.
---
TBH a complete blackout is a bit too far for nullsec, id rather it be that while under gate or wh cloak you arent connected to local.
---
Also the sheer amount of out-of-client intel ESI provides.
---
In my opinion killmails should be aggregated and dumped to ESI evry 24hrs, leaving an archive of battles, fights, wars, ganks, etc. Ingame statistics like number of jumps, pirate NPCs killed and ships/pods killed should also be accessible ingame only and not via ESI.
---
Super Umbrella could be in lowsec, pretty sure PHEW, Snuff, and maybe HTP have pretty good low sec coverage,  but the buffer thing is very different.   I did not think about that as much.   The route to Delve is pretty straight and narrow, but thats just Delve.  So combination good organization and space geography?
---
Is it a velator?
---
It's a bit misleading, null sec in itself is not safe in any way. What people are generally referring to are the defensive response fleets on standby 23/7 to cyno in backup in case someone is tackled. Having local chat instantly provide intel on people entering system gives attackers a vanishing window to catch anything before it can warp off. Feelings about this are mixed. On one hand intel \*is\* far too easy to obtain with the strides people have made organizationally and with supportive infrastructure, \*but\* that organization is player-driven and player-driven action is what nullsec is all about.
---
On the other hand, this of course heavily favors large established alliances and coalitions who have the resources, bodies, capitals, and supportive software. Smaller groups don't have 80 titans and fax's to drop on scene if someone is tackled or being gently violated by a dread rat they can't handle themselves. Since it favors these large groups, people whose primary activity is ratting or mining tend to naturally gravitate to these larger groups at the expense of smaller ones, inhibiting any kind of real growth in the rest of  spaceship land, which is/was becoming increasingly empty and boring.
---
That's the short answer: it's not that it's too safe, it's that it's become too easy.
---
Is it a Sun
---
esis
---
Tldr first: Just plan for and accept the inevitable losses and hope for success over time. No big deal, blackout is a bit less safe overall, but you can still make money exactly like you could before. 
---
Ok, so heres what you do if you actually want to mine in null in an empty TZ. Ratting is exactly the same, just replace "Procurer" with "Myrmidon".
---
(1) Check the most local nullsec market and contracts for new procurers and a complete fitting. If that is there, you're good, skip to step 3. 
---
(2) If there isn't make plans for procuring (ha, see what I did there) additional procs and fits. Jumpclone to Jita and buy a few or alot of them and set up a JF contract, send an order to some other industry guys, build some yourself, whatever. Keep a few for yourself, number depending on how busy your region is, and seed the rest on the market for (jita cost + shipping costs)*1.15 or thereabouts once you get them.
---
(3) Get in your procurer and right click on it. Insure it. Also probably not a bad idea to check the fit and make sure the cargohold doesnt have stuff in it you dont need.
---
(4) Click that scarey undock button. Its a brave new world man.
---
(5) Warp to the anom/moon and start licking rocks.
---
(6) Smash that V key to check dscan often. It saved my Myrm from an Orthrus, so trust me, it does actually work. Just not for recons or cloakies, but theres still alot of non-cloaky stuff flying around.
---
(7) When you die, hope that your Proc has paid for itself, and has made some money.  If not, then try moving to safer space in you alliance if possible. If you did (which is more likely in most space), congradulations, your now a part of the combat ecosystem and you made some money. Now repeat, just like you would have pre-blackout.
---
our posting quality is unmatched

Nooooo I got some Janice Griffith in there too
---
"not actually gay"
---
Damn. I did not know smart bombing T3C's were a thing. And now I want one
---
T2 capital rigs don't really get sold, they mostly sit in titans.... you can get a hole new dread  or carrier for the price of the T2 rigs
---
Honestly this was all sorted with Imperial Legacy as a name.
---
You made me clean my monitor
---
Apparently some day "get fucked" or other variations but the primary reason is good fight.
---
Many FC will ask their fleets to put GF in local after fighting.
---
I definitely use it to mean good fight. I say GG in LOL after every game too though.
---
Sometimes it's a force of habit just to show respect even if you don't want to.
---
Where do i apply.
---
I feel exactly the same.
---
They may have super umbrellas but they use them to kill and drop.
---
In null they're used to defend idiots pveing. You fit a cyno, join fleet and if you're in range and tackled you pop a cyno prior to them placing an inhib and a friendly titan can bridge fleets to you and other caps can jump to you
---
I think everyone's corp is totally cool and interesting on the inside.  Externally you are just as retarded as the next gang of nerds, mine included.
---
What he describes is still possible and is still done.
---
It means they suck at killing PvE ships with PvP fit ships.
---
I understand the Intel thing.  Been on both sides of it.  I can also say Intel saves those who want to be save and still people fuck that up.   I haven't used a program called NEAR2, a guy in Provi made a program that sounds like it does the same thing.  I gave him 500 plex 2 years ago?  Cause I am sucker for 3rd party development.   Randomly give 3rd party devs Plex love. 
---
I carrier ratted in Provi  off and on over a year before my deployment and local aggregator, intel, scouts on gates, and smart flying kept me from loosing my one and only carrier.  While Im sure thousands of carrier were lost in that time period.    I carrier ratted couple times coming back without reading all the dev blogs. Should of seen my face when I would warp out of site when due to NSA lol.   I dont even carrier rat anymore my carrier is PvP fitted now.  Want to try different things now.  
---
I would love to see Blackout implemented in various ways.  
---
ESI data. I think as a guy who lives in Provi I should  not be seeing ESI data from Tenal.   Not sure if CCP can program geographic restrictions into ESI data or have it connected to Upwell or Flex intel structure.
---
I tried to use Zkill as intel tool in provi to see where kills are happen for people that die in silence instead of reporting in intel or see where defense roam needs to go.   When I am doing my own thing prefer having some of the streams over hostile staging vs Zkill.
---
Manufacturing job slots also, I think
---
Try the T3 Destroyers, specifically the Confessor or Hecate. They're funky and quite powerful.
---
Bantam?
---

I ganked my own hauler while drunk gatecamping
---
As a new player trying out PVE opportunities not once has another player been a problem. The mission system on the other hand is a dumpster fire.
---
Makes sense.  Thank you.
---
hey the music's shit but at least we have some baked beans.
---
We're always doing it wrong!
---
And the Goons are going to pay for them!
---
Cool, we'll swing up north provi if we have a slightly bigger gang then. I think I've seen you guys out a few times and just didn't have enough to take the fight.
---
How would you fix it?
---
Being a Providence guy, I think its accurate to say I live under a hostile super umbrella.  Phew, HTP, and co don't really drop their big toys on PvE subcaps. They usually reserve that for blops now.   It does making cap escalations very difficult with them.
---
Blackout out hit us hard.  Maybe more accurate to say ProviBloc shit response to Blackout on a leadership level and peoples own fear hit us hard. Not a fan of arrange fights, but look at zkill. You know what we fly and where we fly typically just bring a gang to match.
---
You mean "taking *the* piss"?
---
I don't think he ever did. Like he doesn't have a plan, except parroting Falcon and a bunch of Volta dudes on Reddit.
---
If they're lookin for a war fund, that's 85B in isk alright, that's almost all immediately usable supplies.
---
Yup. Same thing in test. Spodbrains r us are losing their minds. The small gang groups are having a field day.
---
That's who is funding broken local
---
This is too real.
---
It was mostly about nullsec in the big blocs, rather than nullsec by default.
---
Local combined with intel from ~~bots~~ totally legitimate players and tools like NEAR provided anyone in null for perfect safety. If someone was 2-3 jumps out from where you were ratting or mining, you could already be aware and docking up long before anything hostile entered system. With wormholes the warning was less long, but still; the moment anyone entered system, whether you were paying attention or not, you were made aware.
---
Next up is the blobbing in general. Safety in numbers is too easy if you're always the biggest numbers. Eve has significant issues with people just blobbing up in megacoalitions; especially with capital ships that can jump very long distances instantly, right into a "fight". The biggest group wins by default because they have more numbers and more supers so no matter what you can possibly throw at them, they will win. Which leads to nobody trying anymore outside of smaller attempts (solo/very small groups trying to catch some subcaps), which leads to a very safe environment for those that are in the big groups.
---
Nullsec was actually much safer than highsec, where anyone can at any time be out to kill you but you are not allowed to take them out pre-emptively, have no way to know someone out to get you is multiple systems out, or any such thing. You also can't have your hundred buddies provide you with safety simply by hanging around within a few lightyears of where you are. Meanwhile, nullsec still had the massively higher gains in everything PVE than highsec and this is the big thing - big rewards, lower than highsec risk. This meant it was definitely too safe, since nullsec is supposed to have higher rewards for *higher* risk.
---
Of course, this all relates/related to big entities. Smaller entities live with high risk, not having the setups/automated tools/super fleet of the big ones. Obviously, since they have the same or less gains at way higher risk than those in big groups, most of them just get absorbed into the big groups because there's just too many benefits in safety. Had CCP not done anything, in a few years i think all of null would simply be a small number of megacoalitions, all blue to one another so that everyone could farm the game in maximum safety.
---
Depends. Are you in low sec? Null? Wormspace? Faction War? When I was in Faction war I liked the Beacher and Firetail. 
---
Apparently the VNI is a good PvP ship now. 
---
In null bombers are fun if you find a grouped up fleet.
---
Vni had a nice overhaul recently
---
It's not neutral logis. Allies can't help eachother in wars, unless they have only the exact same wars. So you can add a rando 1 man corp to 1 of the wars, and suddenly they can't rep eachother, even tho 999 out of 1000 enemies are shared between both.
---
He is taking advantage of his position to fuck with us more than would be considered necessary. He is mocking us.
---
Null sec before the blackout was "safe" because you could rat for hours on end and simply hide when local showed anything remotely dangerous.  Null sec pve is some of the most profitable activities with the least about of risk. Thus, why people would AFK rat and bot there. 
---
You basically have two risks. The pve risk is a joke, so they made the PvP risk higher.
---
1. Foxtowombopuss Coalition was put into defence war/ giving up CE progress 2016, due to a DRF FullForce-Deployment on Tenal Border. Lumpy had a Ace-Deal with NC/PL at this time. So DRF didnt get involved in Tenal, the Coalition was allowed to remove their assets but had to give their space to NC/PL. 
---
ahh and Lumpy got Paid 300+b from PL/NC, which the other coalition members never got a share from, as they used it to change their SCAP from Shield -&gt; Armor in Lowsec.
---
2. youre correct, we got asked by alot of partys to join them. like Trium / Panfam but they didnt want our alliance, they wanted us to merge into a Corp. so we sided with RR and took tenal with them.
---
3. hopefully yes :) *Content*
---
Is this what you really believe?
---
What does "Baed" mean then?
---
Do you really believe that?
---
It means they cant kill a Rorq with their 5 man nano af gang and want CCP to nerf PvE again.
---
dude is claiming they were on their way down but didn't get to jump in, like no, that was ncdot, y'all were asleep don't fucking front
---
Big blocs can happen in NPC Null and Lowsec, but generally do not probably due to lack of resources to support such a base, especially with no i-hubs.  
---
What do you think of Providence?
---
"Had CCP not done anything, in a few years i think all of null would  simply be a small number of megacoalitions, all blue to one another so  that everyone could farm the game in maximum safety."
---
I watched this video other day and made me think today.  Way before my time, but seem like at this time 4 mega coalitions became 3 then became two.  Then not sure what happen.  Need to read his book.

&gt;Whats the relation between you and GOTG? You seem rather....I dunno...fanatical maybe?

why do you keep posting?
---
They did. They switched the chat back onto TQ itself in Spring. This is the first time we see these bugs again since the debacle of the new chat cloud service throughout all of 2018 that led to them putting it back onto TQ. It's also not part of any 'chaos' roadmap. That doesn't exist, but they did a nice job at pretending it does during the TiS softball interview.
---
Game is still broken
---
You need to lose more ships.
---
Prove you wrong? Ok, you're stainguy.
---
About as much as I trust it in wormhole space right now
---
No c4 bad, c5 3x cap mirror brawls good
---
The rigs you are talking about (Field Purgers) are one way of fitting pve ships and they're used because they provide a decent shield regen without using any cap. They're used because you can easily get a somewhat tanky cap stable ship without sacrificing too much in mobility or dps. This fit type is balanced so that you cannot really fit a point and web because every extender and invuln provides you with a lot of your rep power.
---
But that's not the only way to fit a pve ship. You can easily fit an armor or active shield tank in a pve ship (using an Armor Repairer or Shield Booster). You then have to fit mods to get cap stable, which can be rigs or modules depending on fitting space. This is the real difference, because on a pvp ship, you'd usually sacrifice this cap stability for more dps or tank. In fact, some higher end pve in wormholes is better done in an active shield/armor tank because you need the extra repping power of the repper/booster, but then you'd also make sure to be cap stable enough to clear the room. Also, depending on what kind of pve, some ships are actually completely buffer tanked and rely on clearing the room before you lose your buffer, or they can also rely on sig tanking (going so fast that the rats cannot hit you) but these are obviously more unsafe and not beginner techniques.
---
So fitting pve ships is a lot more complicated than putting on Field Purger rigs, shield extender and resist mods. Otherwise, how would you pve with Gallente, Amarr and some Minmatar ships?
---
You got it! lol
---
Uhhhh... ok? This game wouldn’t work as a single player game, but you do you boo boo. There’s nothing stopping you from playing this game as a single player and ignoring everyone around you.
---
I'm not going to pretend to be a game designer or programmer, I don't really know. Players who are dependent on others for defense are always going to gravitate to safety. Making null "less safe" doesn't really help the problem of player concentration in small 5-7ly areas, it seems to me to just make those who have those protective fleets more incentive to stay there. Some may just quit because they aren't down with the increased risk, and some have and will and that's fine - players who are playing with the expectation of total safety spoon-fed to them by others are not helpful anyway. The issue won't be solved with a little creative dicking of the chat system or adjusting alphas, cynos, capital application/proliferation etc if there are not enough new players - meaningful growth in null wont occur under any circumstances without new players trying their luck out here.
---
Lol, it would seem i need too as well.
---
&gt;velator
---
Nope.
---
I get what you are saying, but there has to be a certain balance between time spent and return on investment.
---
I always play Hardcore mode in Path of Exile and Diablo 3 (D3 is dead tho), so I dont mind loosing my character when I fork up. But the times a mechanic isnt working in what the playerbase precive as somewhat balanced, then Grinding Gear Games quickly do tweaks.
---
Boat made the same point on Metashow, regarding Blackout, and I agree with him. Ok, remove local, but is there aspects of the game that will become too powerful if left as is? Like cloaking or covert cynos? How should xyz mechanic be balanced to prevent the pendulum from swinging from one extreme to another?
---
&gt;99% uptime is actually quite crap for most web services.
---
it's better than that, i just rounded
---
kind of a dumb hill to die on though
---
"the new implementation which was sold as being better than the old"
---
The tough truth is that it's just cheaper for CCP to maintenance it and "better than the old" it's just another bs line taken out from Marketing 101 text book.
---
&gt; *but* that organization is player-driven and player-driven action is what nullsec is all about.
---
Lets see how "player driven" it is without cynos.
---
i have uploaded all my video on it :)) 
---

---
Woah is that how my post read? Damn.
---
I am curious if PHEW/HTP would still gate capitals around our staging system if they can't use cyno.
---

---
Exequror :D
---
elite anchoring
---
That's a super interesting thought experiment that will never occur, thank you for mentioning it. Or something.
---
I mean, there's a small chance it's blackjack and hookers, which is a win for the scammer and scammee.
---
It's just small groups wanting to kill expensive ships that require like 40M SP to fly and cost 20 billion isk, with ships that require 5M  SP and cost 60M isk, and with no risk, no thinking, low effort, no counter play, etc.
---
For example right now with the blackout theese groups have been abusing ganking with cloaky ships. This is super low effort, low risk, high reward and no counter play...but they are not complaining there.
---
So in the end, this are lazy people that prefer asking for nerfs instead of adapting. So whatever nerf they manage to accomplish by crying, organized groups will adapt anyway, and they will be crying forever.
---
The irony is that the safest place to be in EVE is under the protection of your super umbrella is sov space. The most dangerous place to be is in high sec. An uninformed player might believe that they are more secure in high security space than null security, but this is not the case.
---
Whats wrong with the assets window ingame, granted it does group it by structure but its there.
---
How many ships should it take to kill a Rorq?  Why shouldn't the Rorqual be nerft again?  I am interested in hearing the points of view of people who think null is too safe.  Whats your view on why you think your gameplay is balance?
---
no...shit was changing from system to system after I death clone back to null...having Jita local and seen their local trading shit :/
---
I'd go there for sure, guaranteed content is reward enough.
---
Oh I am sorry English is not my primary language and I couldn't make it easier for your retarded brain to read :o
---
Haha, you call KOS a pvp entity?
---
Mining is not generating isk. It is removing it in npc refine taxes
---
My Corp doesn’t play this game
---
You are correct. A great many people have no interest whatsoever in participating in anything but PvE unless forced to. They aren't social and just don't emjoy that kind of gameplay in this or any other game. They're into building and that little kick to the brain when they hear the chime of isk falling into their wallet.
---
You think SP and ISK requirement make super balance or is there more to it?
---
The first part is correct.  And goons were *too hard* to fight.  So they followed around smaller alliances like Brave and TEST that couldn't seriously threaten their supers.  Because that was "fun".
---
I do think Horde was a long term decision though.  They had how much power those numbers gave Brave, even *horribly* mismanaged, and they wanted a piece.
---
This plus citadel mechanics heavily favoring defenders, and the size of null meaning small incursions are too bothersome to undertake even ignoring the other difficulties and large incursions are seen coming a mile away.
---
Mining is generating isk, because no matter how much tax you have to pay, you can sell it on the market and that shit just respawns every downtime (not moons)
---
Currently have an alpha with t2 gila + faction drones because if high hp. Try guristas refuges with escalation(scout outpost). Also guristas den. Never try hallucinogen distribution sprout in alpha gila. Alpha t2 rattlesnake is plausible for hgs with some rewarps so consider mwd for rattlesnake.
---
also you can try 1-2 abbys. With high expertize you can do even 3. 
---
Worth to remind venture wh gas harvesting,
---
What about a local without chat logs being produced?  If a person was afk ratting before blackout they would need to have one of those chat log reader apps to tell what was up.
---
slicer always has a place in my heart
---
Solo play and a coop mode, imo, are collectively a game design problem with Elite Dangerous. It has a number of mechanics that could/should be PVP conflict generators. Namely the background simulation and powerplay, but to some degree thargoids, community goals and engineers could also be roleplay conflict generators. But if you PVP with anyone in open play that is doing literally anything, you get called a griefer. And you get told that you're driving people to solo play.
---
So yes, there would 100% be players that would just want to play alone, if only so their progress is safe in eve.
---
&gt;Tops 1-2 hours a day/ tops 4 days a week.
---
Sad that this is called casual. You'd usually call that a serious hobby. Anyways maybe try to do some exploration in a heron.
---
For missions you have to grind standings and for the lower one you don't need an Gila anyways. Do the SoE arc choose a faction and start the grind I guess. For level one and two T1 destroyers are enough to use and actually better than cruisers as they warp faster. For the standings also check COSMOS missions. They can give you a nice standing boost in the beginning. (Carreer agents are also nice for standings at a true new player.)
---
because if you for example have assets spread over like 200 different stations its simply not usable. the ingame assets windows is complete garbage. The fact alone that i need to open up every single station as if its a folder to click on to open it and to see whats inside while having NO information on the first look if there even is anything of value inside. 
---
Lets say you re a trader. your character windows shows an estimated value of lets say: 20b and your assets are spread over 200 stations.  well good luck collecting stuff and doing that somewhat efficient.  i would legit pay someone money to do it for me because its such a pain in the ass
---
Is it a titan?
---
&gt;i would legit pay someone money to do it for me because its such a pain in the ass
---
Create hauling contracts to Jita or whichever tradehub you fancy.
---
Consider bookmarking your mission sites and return with a salvage fit ship, it may not be alot for level 1-2 missions but it’s something,  the higher level the missions gives a greater return in both isk payout and salvage materials you can sell of course.
---
Best thing about SoE missions is the reputation boost you get to a factiok of your choise, when you’ve completed it, and okay newbie isk payout. A ship that’s quick to align and warp while still able to pack a punch, is reccomendable here as you’ll be traveling alot.
---
If you want to earn isk quicker or do it in a varied way rather than a constant mission/salvage grind, consider exploration in a magnate or similiar t1 exploration ship, they’re decently cheap to replace compared to what you can make in isk. Don’t be afraid of dipping your toes in wormholes, low and null, the risks are higher but so is the reward. 
---
Mining is slow paced, remember to compress your ore in a station with a reprocessing module on it, it’ll save you on the cargo hold and increase the price you earn per load, you can reach out to mining corps in 0.5 systems and ask if you can mine their ore in return for a percentage of their ore in tax, or just plain ninja it for the slight thrill.
---
One way to fix it is to somehow make the benefits of being in a large alliance more balanced with the negatives. Right now if you want to make ISK and go on some fleets the Imperium is the place to go, or maybe Legacy, but they’re practically the same in the way they operate.
---
How do they balance the pros and cons of being in a large alliance? I don’t really know I’m not a game designer but common sense clearly shows that it’s far too beneficial to be in a blob alliance like Goons or Test.
---
Perhaps resource depletion would help solve this issue? Some how making fleet fights more than an n+1 game? Again idk but something has to be done to balance this as it’s the fundamental problem with nullsec.
---
CCP and fucking up the chat system is a pretty iconic duo at this point.
---
These are fantastic would love to see these changes, very well thought out.
---
I was thinking about Resource Depletion.  What would Goons look like if you transplanted them into Syndicate,Faction Warfare, or Providence.
---
We’re not down here for good fights. And we don’t care about if pgl or vily thinks we’re blobbong [sic]. They’ve talked so much shit about PL and how we aren’t committed to our deploys and how TEST is this battle hardened group. Well we’re here to tell them to nut up or shut up. They’re going to be homeless soon.
---
The game needs objectives for a smaller group to undertake that can harass larger groups. Shooting vulnerable points on a citadel to knock out modules or services or to knock cargo/fuel out into space. Being able to affect sov without a full on ihub battle. More ships in space that aren't throaway ships or rorq/super toughness. Etc.
---
Hehe, well I wrote tops as there are weeks where I am unable to log on at all. Yeah for lower missions I'm running a destroyer atm. Wanna get a Gila for lv3 farming. Did the careers and gonna check cosmos next. Thanks for the heads up!
---
Life has gotten harder in Providene under the PHEW/HTP super umbrella.
---
I've read somewhere gas is very profitable, might try it.
---
Yes. I can't believe I forgot about you use to be able to disable certain services.
---
Seems like you are looking for crusir stuff but if at all intrested in fw I would recommend flying some t1 frigates or destroyers more so destroyers as I find they are more fun :) blasters catalysts and arty/auto thrashers are great. As for t1 frigates dual rep breachers and tormenters are ptetty darn strong but you will prob have more fun running atrons or executioners as they are more engable and generally pretty slept on.
---
Yeah have a salvager fit, quite tedious as it slows the game down. I haven't done any wormholes yet, but might start checking them out. Thanks a lot for the in-depth review. Gonna read up more on these!
---
I am talking about SLYCE. KOS were ok when they were not dead.
---
What is your policy?
---
Hello pvp npc
---
you know they making fun of your cta pings and strat ops right? cuz they know you can see their pings so they just making fun of you retards lol
---
Wheres the lie eh
---
I find mining is best done in groups with a lively chat
---
Go ask Suas. Dude's got a knack for losing keepstars.
---
Do you remember a time when the old chat system didn't work?  You can't blame sample bias when they switched from a system that never had problems to a system that has problems no matter how occasionally.
---
Oh yeah? Why don't you tell me where you hang you in high sec so I can show you how lucky you have been so far?
---
i give up. maybe people dont understand that but it is not about the hauling or anything. i do create contracts. its about managing your assets. but anyways. i got jassets working with a tool called JarX now so whatever
---
I wonder why you would do that
---
you forgot to include XiX, Siberian Squad, Razor, Patriots, Blue Sun Interstellar and Army of Mango.....oh ya...and Goons
---
The problem was expecting it to matter to HK once you werent useful anymore.
---
I mainly do HS exploration right now and my corp has been wardecced by one of those corps that just wardeccs everything for content's sake. I've put two warp stabs on my destroyer but I need advice on what rigs I should get so on the off chance I'm attacked I canto tank long enough to warp away.
---
no more local!!
---
&gt;Big blocs can happen in NPC Null and Lowsec, but generally do not probably due to lack of resources to support such a base, especially with no i-hubs. 
---
This is the big one, nullsec is the only area of space where each additional player brings their own gold to farm. Everywhere else, either through directly depleting the available sites or by devaluing LP rewards so you wouldn't really mass recruit members who don't actually bring something to the table enough people to facilitate modern super umbrellas.
---
Totally agree re: ED.  I have played the offline mode and found it really dull - but when close to buy back cost in funds on a new ship, the temptation to stay offline and grind is real ;)
---
You should choose C1-3 because they contains non-sleeper data and relic sites. Should come and leave fast, choose the can gives best profit, hack and leave. Moreover you should learn how to create safe spot, and use another webs like Tripwire, Pathfinder or Zkillboard to check the wormhole you are in. In my experience, when comes from k-space you should move to few holes and try to avoid K162 as much as possible before think about hacking. Finally, stay out from any data or relic sites have the name “forgottern or unsecured”.
---
Another advice is if you find a wormhole lead to high-sec or Ls but close to high sec. Check the number of jumps from that system to trade hubs (like Jita or Perimeter - the Keepstar has taxes and fee cheaper). If you already have money and the loot is very profit, make corrier contract, 1 jump = 1m isk and collarectal fee is the value of your loot. Its safer than transport them directly to trade hub.
---
Do not waste your time orca mining in highsec is my advice. There are far more lucrative options.
---
You are suggesting the worst of both worlds. Log parsers were one of the major issues when local was still fully operational, giving ratters and miners ample warning to dock up before anything could even remotely threaten them.
---
Yeah.
---
I am not going to say all of that is totally a problem, but it definitely can be capitalized on in a manner that starts to break the risk balance.
---
Also, the super umbrella is about having the absolute biggest force around.
---
In lowsec, no lowsec groups have the biggest umbrella around. They can't Wade around with absolute impunity.
---
I found it but I'm not telling where
---
Yeah but it's easier to find out who those people are with a list of people who are/were in system
---
What if what makes us special is that we are retarded on the inside, too?
---
Sign me up.
---
JEveAssets works great for me for a couple of years now. Fits your use case pretty well. Maybe try to get it running one more time.
---
Another top notch print. Looks sweet!
---
 I think you misunderstood.  I was suggesting a local without parsers. Where if youre active not afk and paying attention you have better chance to live than someone who does not use all the tools available to them
---
The new system is unstable every now and then, but what I'm saying is the old system causing lag and crashing the servers during tidi fights was a much bigger issue. 
---
You can never go back to the old system. Any change to EVE in the future will continue to aim to offload services that are not essential to the fight away from the main servers.
---
Also might risky... But the prize!!! xD
---
Thanks!
---
You can't rep/boost anybody involved in a war if they're not in your corp/alliance. What does that have to do with adding people to a war?  What exactly is the point you're trying to make?
---
Kinda annoying when one view point speaks for another in away thats not honest or genuine instead giving their own view point.  Which probably going to do thread tomorrow why you think null sec is balance.
---
Not really, but apparently many autists think so. It is suspected that such experiments help them prepare for inevitable nerfs.
---
Man I completely derped out and misread your comment, sorry. I still prefer the blackout personally, but I'm obviously biased. I do think the parsers need to go away if local comes back, and it would be as easy as delaying them 10 minutes - this would keep all of their functionality besides the real-time intel.
---

---
So you can remotely scam in Jita local? I fail to the problem
---
Is it related to KeePass and how are they different?
---
Yes its a fork forgot the difference im about to sleep.
---
As a bonus, you also avoid the hurdle of having all of your shit stolen after having worked for years to obtain it.
---
Just play on Sisi to replicate the idea of solo play, just pick a particular place other than the common testing areas.
---
That amount of activity is fine for an "active" player in a corp.
---
But for alpha income with low initial investment the best is probably exploration. Wormhole, lowsec, or null.
---
If you can afford/fly a poorfit t1 battleship, incursions are quite lucrative, and though they are a group activity, it's very drop-in and drop-out. They have very specific fits.
---
If you already have a gila, a proper fit (even just meta and not t2) should be able to handle pretty much any combat or ded site in hisec. You can get good drops but its a little lucky. Use a mobile tractor unit or know which enemies have the chances to drop good loot.
---
Yes please join them guys, still waiting them to find my WH :D

I just hit related on zKillboard, [here's what showed up](https://zkillboard.com/related/31002226/201908030500/). 
---
Their wormhole is a C5 Pulsar. I would still never want to use a Chemosh in such a hole. Okay it might have 5kk EHP with genos and a shield implant, neut an impressive 780GJ/s (about the equivalent of 3 Bhaalgorns fit with all neuts in the highs) but I don't think it's worth it.
---
Salvaging is not worth it for missions, even if you swap to a dedicated salvaging ship. The extra missions you could complete in the time it takes to salvage one mission will earn you more.
---
&gt; the old system causing lag and crashing the servers during tidi fights was a much bigger issue
---
No it wasn't.  It made no difference in the user experience during tidi fights.  In any case, those fights happen maybe once a year.  The chat being broken is an every day problem.  Taking a working system and replacing it with a broken system is bad no matter how you want to spin it.
---
this is what goons ~pretend to~ really believe
---
There's nothing that has been exaggerated. It's all statement of fact. They are cheaper, easier, and safer to run than ratting in a super. 
---
You can lose a handful of Rorqs and it's less than losing a single super.
---
The rock came back out completely black... Should I be worried?
---
I think they do that anyway, isnt there one dude who drops haws dreads and then gates it around there pocket?
---
ehh..few neuting carriers aren’t better?
---
"We are not happy until you're content."
---
Not sure if they mean "content" as in "satisfied" or "content" as in "material" or "food for my drones &amp; torpedos".
---
I def believe it was something with Spectrum. It started happening the same day my ethernet went out, but I still had WiFi. Called them the next day and they sent out a new router and it's been working fine since.

Still posting to help save the planet.

More seriously, Im genuinely interested why someone would spend so much time posting about gotg. Ive only played eve since the tri-DRF war. Ive googled about gotg and sort to learn some history. For the rest I sometimes ask here. Never seen a dude so fierce, based on amount of comments and what u say, so you seemed like a dude to ask about whats up, despite the co2 claim being beyond a little retarded.
---
I've seen ganking and I have done some. Learned how not to be a target week one. Learned how to avoid gate camps in low sec week two. To be frank, this shit is not rocket science of I of all people can figure it out.
---
How to get a level one agent to not give me a level 3-4 storyline mission? Haven't figured out how to work around bugs.

Hello Invidia Gloriae Comes! I appreciate your commentary but would like to point out that WINGSPAN has a presence all over New Eden. Some pilots might refer to us as a "Nomad" corporation. Our delivery agents are simply trying our best to keep munitions in our bay and can not afford the money it would cost to keep and maintain any form of station. This is to better serve you. 
---
We try to clean up New Eden and ensure that every pilot is never alone. We just simply don't have enough pilots to keep up with demand!
---
Join up today and receive all the benefits we are entitled to. Chance has promised that they are forthcoming.
---
Then what
---
Oh don't get me wrong, the role play is hilarious.
---
Not so much when you guys jump into a wormhole from high sec only to stay in jump range to get back.
---
If you’re up for doing things non-solo, you could look for a mission group to join. They’ll often let new players salvage, and you can pull in decent ISK that way. 
---
Solo exploration is a also a good way to make some ISK with time constraints. Train into a Heron and do that when you’re online.
---
It would be awesome if you can expand your ammunition delivery service
---
I ordered a few thousands dread guristas light missiles and they still haven't shown up in my wormhole yet
---
Null secs not balanced, and there's ways they can bring it more in line, but throwing away local puts all the power into risk averse ganking or super cap umbrellas, this doesn't balance the game this doesn't even make it better, arguably it makes the null blocks stronger and those in between get shit on from above and below.

I apologize for any bad experiences you may have had.

I can assure you that I personally aim to find pilots who are as far from high security space as possible. After all, resources often run low the further away you are.

If you'd like a feedback form, please let me know and I'll furnish you with one.

Terms and conditions may apply. Please check with your local agent to verify delivery capabilities to your hull, cruiser and below. Geographic restrictions to include being between one and three jumps from major trade hub. Limit one ship per dozen delivery agents.
---
BebopChicken, if you can please provide your system and any Tripwire data that may assist us in this delivery, we'll happily attempt to deliver at our earliest convenience.

That is something people who want to do that could do, of course it gets mirrored now and then so things do vanish iirc

they should just ban half of the players from the game permanently, that ought to reduce server loads by about half!

I'm sorry about the wait BebopChicken. If you can provide us with your system and any data on how to reach it, we'll deliver at our earliest convenience. Again, I'm sorry the delay.

I have done as you've described once before making a 'Sim city' indeed it was great, until a mirror came of course.

The game needs a balance of risk reward. Rn you put a f1 monkey into a vni and he will print isk compared to any other activity. The pleb has to be beheaded.
---
just out of interest how is using the same password WITH 2FA enabled affect account security? yes you are using the same password, but the 2FA key will always be different every time and what are the chances of randomly getting it right before some sort of bruteforce protection kicks in (although we're talking CCP here, is it even a thing in EvE launcher)?
---
K716, I am not sure that drones eat. I am positive that torpedoes do not require sustenance and in fact have an expiration date. We try to deliver them to your hull as quickly as possible to keep them from exploding in our own bays.
---
nothing wrong with jeveassests. the problem is you.
---
RemindMeBot predicts local will be fixed 9 months from now.
---
ty sir, glad you like it
---
bsb!
---
This is simply a lie. They have jump drives, thats it. And that is accounted in their price.
---
Its called hi sec, don't fly a freighter and you are generally okay
---
Played like 5 or 6 years ago. Now with the alpha toons i was thinking bout giving it a shot again. But: How viable are alphas anyway? Would i be welcome in a corp or laughed at? Also is there a quick read about what's needed to get back into the game? Tx
---
Another satisfied customer! Thank you Sylnn Severn!
---
No, taking a piss. In Iceland, it is customary to urinate once a solar cycle, in a public ceremony similar to the ancient Norse Blöt ritual. 
---
To urinate prematurely, in secret, or without observing tradition is seen as a grave insult to Icelandic society and the punishment is quite severe.
---
The hunters have a lack of intel too. Easier to bait than it used to be.
---
You should rephrase your statement to say that groups want to be able to kill 30M SP and 20B isk ships with fifty dudes flying ships that collectively require 250M SP and 20B isk. Then it doesn't sound as dumb, while having the added bonus of being more accurate.
---
I imagine with no local in null-sec that RnK would have had a goddamn field day. Literally no way to see it coming.
---
No its not. Saying something is a fact when its not makes it into a lie. Saying 20 Rorqs are easy to handle is a lie, its a lot of work. Saying thats its standard procedure to multibox 20 is a lie, its an outlier. And its still a debate whether its actually safer to run than a super since safety is situational in Eve. Them being cheaper is connected to income, 3 excav fitted Rorqs with some bling cost more than a super yet makes less isk. 
---
These are facts.
---
Now is the Rorq broken? Yes, it used to be a lot worse but I still got issues with it. But do we need to lie to get our point across? No we actually dont.
---
kill pixel
---
God, those messages haven't stopped since the blackout.
---
This piloting is on point 👌
---
"...Shit I knew that was too many boosters for that moon probe."
---
yeah, imagine having to ping a lot to fight a coalition 2x your size lmao they're so retarded
---
While our official policy is to remain no further than 5km away from a B274, many of our delivery agents roam further in search of elusive customers. Rest assured that any agents who make a delivery outside of our operating area will be fined accordingly.
---
Jeveassets is good on the rare occasion it doesn't just eat all your memory and say 'lol nope'.
---
x3 pushes it to over 80k EHP.
---

---
Gratz, you are a no-lifer. You are in the %1 of players that still log in after their first 3 month. Most people will just quit after their first high-sec gank, losing their hard earned T1 destroyer. It is plain stupid. Just because something is hard or takes time to learn does not make it challenging or fun. It is tedious is what it is. High Sec should be safe, period. You have low, null and wormhole space for all that risk vs reward gameplay. This game always had low player retention rate and high sec griefing is the number 1 reason for it. Not everyone is a  masochist  and likes a unforgiving game. Certainly not the majority.
---
I see that we differ in our opinion about money printing in mining....
---
You say you are not printing isk, but materials. 
---
I do not see any difference between the two. Yes I am aware that mining does not give an instant amount of isk to your wallet, but it still generates something from nothing. If that something had a value (wich it does) you are basically printing money.
---
I talked with people that can (word of mouth, I don't know the actual numbers) mine the materials needed for a dread in less than an hour, I view that as a problem.
---
Even if he does not build the dread, he can still sell it for a shitload of isk
---
Safe than sorry. Still vulnerable to some philshing attacks. I use FreeOTP by red hat over googles close source option.
---
Get a supercarrier or a rorq.
---
I actually do know what I am talking about. It's you who is sperging nonsence. Not my fault, currently nobody in snuff, that your idea of the game doesn't align with common sense.
---
Honestly been playing for about a year, with limited cap experience. But I think there should be a direct proportion to the amount of isk per ship fielded. A 10b fit rorq, should have the equivalent kill it within a reasonable amount of time. I'm not saying 5b worth of bombers can't kill that 10b rorq but it will take a lot longer. This is harder cause of skill per player etc. But it should be a good baseline. I'm drunk so disregard
---
I'm new, what do you mean ramp? Does something about his fit do more damage the longer he fires at the same target?
---
unflinching. You'll ruin their narrative if being invaded and fighting a glorious war. It take 5 to 1 ratios before they consider it a fair fight for them. And if they can't they ping their big daddy bee to come support them on.
---
you must not pay a lot of attention 
---
i post a lot about literally everything, not just gotg. look at my comment history
---
why would you use genos over talismans?
---
genuine question
---
right on- i eventually stumbled upon a diagnostic tool dedicated to this problem (found at the website i listed somewhere above). it appears that in the wake of CCP’s response to DDOS attacks,  some wires get tangled now and again between them and certain isps. the problem persists, but hopefully spectrum is taking my request seriously. until then, the VPN work around seems to work. at least it did last night. ill try it again sometime today
---
Still, cap neuts barely neut subcaps, they have a heavy penalty.
---
Used to use your service, commended for patient to wait for me for 6hours to deliver just 5 Hoglobin II
---
What seems to do well right now are jaggs hecates, retributions. I like the omen navy issue or the caldari navy hookbill.
---
I’ve never heard of this issue before so it’s probably your computer (probably driver related), contact CCP support anyways they always try to be as helpful as possible
---
"Yeah, smash that chaos button!  Oh, shit, it's stuck!  Ctrl-Z!  Ctrl-Z!"
---
nice- thanks for sharing your experience. hopefully they’re able to fix my problem too. for now, looks like running my VPN is the workaround. ill see if it works again later today
---
And this is why highsec exists 🤗
---
That's pretty funny because I have yet to receive a delivery of torpedos from WiNGSPAN. Although I'm not that active of a player, and was denied status as a Delivery Agent, I still think it's part of your mission to make sure those rusting Caldari Navy Nova Torpedos don't get too rusty in those tubes.
---
Should a 10b macharial smash a rorqual then?
---
**Hello**, I'm an amarr prince and I've got a deal for you!
---
Recently I have the need to divest my fortune from my person, and after looking I feel you are the right person to handle my assets as you see fit! Billions of isk and assets, that I can't have in my possession due to losing a bet with another amarr prince. 
---
In order to make the transfer, I'll need 250 million isk to cover contracting and transfer costs. Just send it as direct payment with the message "Asset transfer bet" and you'll have your lucky earnings before the slaves revolt again.
---
You are one who killed me in Allyt good job. Im happy you leave that SHIT ally
---
So... what's the offer?
---
Talismans would be very much viable. However I only accounted for tank: there's little point in that thing over just a neuting Archon if you're going to not use it as a dreadnought, since you'd need triage on the field in the first place.
---
Haha, I guess so!  Rock on, RemindMe Bot!
---
I didnt claim your gotg posts were many on a relative scale based on your personal posting, but ic ur point.
---
Most bots used local to determine if they needed to get to a safe point. With local gone in null said bots have shifted to lowsec mining for the most part, but others still in null have d-scan working... but they left the local scraping stuff in place. Two birds one stone here, some players might get false flagged, but with how it was done, bot responses are easy to pick out over a period of a few hours.
---
UwU
---
kek
---
To continue this...
---
I don't see the problem in the fact that someone can mine 1b,.... 2b,... or more in minerals in an hour.
---
I see the problem in the infinite amount of resources there are. They don't run out.
---
Belts respawns every downtime, Anomalies respawns when you finish them, moons respawn - not sure about the timeframe there, but I bet 1bil that it's not possible to mine a moon until it no longer exists (show me proof from CCP and give me your in game name to receive it)
---
It's like here on earth. The wealthiest people are the ones that mine resources, yes there are a few that managed to amass wealth in other ways, but the wealthiest are still the miners (just look at all the Oil Tychoons). Unlike here on earth, resources in eve just... respawn.
---
You forgot the part where they dock up the second local shows a non blue.
---
oh ye i forgot the narrative is more important :o
---
is that a killmark or just a spec of dust?
---
&gt; Nullsec was actually much safer than highsec, where anyone can at any time be out to kill you but you are not allowed to take them out pre-emptively
---
Concord is the best response fleet there is, as long as you have more than 10K EHP per tornado the response fleet will save you.
---
If you go by the "isk produced to ship value destroyed" as a metric of risk, wormholes are by far the safest.
---
If you can provide us a way to find you, I can make sure that any rusted ordnance in your hold is disposed of.
---
even with the signature bonus in pulsar ?
---
You're propably neither so your assessment on this is pretty irrelevant
---
If local is a real problem to keep working, then that would be genius!
---
hmm, CCP ...... Genius.
---
I doubt that those who love local in null would see it that way.
---
HOWEVER, On first impression it looks like it actually be a genius move, and a very brave one, and a good one for the long term survival and thriving of the game.
---
So whatever their original motivation, let's just settle on Genius.
---
This is awesome!
---
Savage, but true.  I believe in you Falcon... lead us to the promised land!!
---
Inspiring piloting
---
I think CCP wants me to buy something
---
Widespread NBSI policy means that the only neutrals you see (pre-Blackout) were roaming PVP'ers or Relic site runners via a wormhole.
---
If you know what the person's goal is, then it's easy to know what to do in response.
---
If everyone went back to NRDS, then more neutrals would be around. More neutrals means Intel networks don't give meaningful notice of danger.
---
And the jump drives have a problem in instant teleporting that is uncounterable.
---
wtb
---
Do it!!
---
Imagine being this dumb. Safety in highsec can be guaranteed by just fitting correctly, no active actions needed. That can't be said about any other region of space.
---
is it brown cake
---
Chemikals is a sociable corporation. Logging on to voice communication improves health.
---
I usually self criticise when I record myself on the toilet
---
Offshore oil rigs should stand up to most navies too.
---
I was wondering if that fit is good for ratting in wormholes. Also my dps is about 407 with this fit.
---
Can i borrow the fit? I only get 400 dps.
---
The south of EVE Online safe. There is plenty of room for roaming space.
---
I want one T\_T
---
Opener asked about Gila use. So my answer was about alpha gila newbie friendly low risk activity.
---
Btw my passive shield alpha gila was suicided by a pack of thrashers so i won't say that high sec gila anom krabbing is no risk, you still need to be ready, properly aligned and spam v button to be ready to gtfo on sudden apperance of gang in your 1-5 au range. 
---
There is a lot of pimped out (&gt;1bil) highsec krabbing gilas on zkillboard. My one was just 300 mil with t2 fit. 
---
There is a reason to have a pimped out rattlesnake just to sit un and make any hs mission, anom or whatever because there is must be a really big suicide squad to put omnitank shieldbuffer rattle down ;)
---
DSTs are popular low-class wormhole logistics... niche application but that's most shit in Eve tbh.
---
Wormholer btw
---
I'm pretty sure I can't sell them, but I appreciate the thought.
---
Holy effing want.
---
Fly frigate abyss with some friends. You can do it in a punisher or kestrel.
---
Lies.
---
I applied and never heard anything :( brought my torpedo delivering self to TEST!
---
Same, the first sentence was all we needed
---
A good Retri is 250-300mil fully fitted, cheaper fits are no where near as effective, it also really wants snakes after the nerfs.
---
You can try evernus, it works, but its not currently in further development. you'll have to hook up each character in each account but once you are done you just get all your assets from Import all (API import) and you get valuations based on Jita by default.
---
Its a market tool mainly but it will do what you want from what you've said.
---
Click and hold the circled pointy thing, and then drag it to the right.
---
https://i.imgur.com/UxBztkd.png
---
The idea is that you can drag those arrows around, shifting the colour scale (anything below the left edge will be blue, anything above the white edge will be white) to allow you to get better detailed views of how concentrated the resources are.
---
This is a balanced response that covers it well. Unfortunately most other responses are meh.
---
Fact is, things were killed in massive amounts in NS before the blackout and arguably less now after it. It was never safe, saying it was is an outright lie that zkillboard can disprove in seconds. 
---
But there used to be a balance in which big groups had manpower and organisation and smaller ones being more specialized. With the changes made over the last years the balance got offset giving bigger groups the opportunity to catch up in specialization and this in conjuntion with organisation and manpower created what see today (my take on it). A NS with high SP, high isk, big toys, lots of manpower and organized defense.
---
Now some want the old balance back, others dont. And some, like me, are saying that balance cant be regained due to the changes. You cant erase all that SP, isk, organisation, manpower, toys and so on that big blocs have accumulated. Not without shattering the game completely.
---
So is NS inherently safe, no its not. Has NS been made safer thanks to people, yes. Will changes to that safety yield positive results? No. Because the only way to actually make a real dent is by cutting down organization and manpower and you cant do that without losing thousands and thousands of players.
---
Which people are actually advocating for now, even though they might not even understand it.
---
I've been there. Tried to join wingspan last time they were actively recruiting never heard from anyone despite reaching out numerous times
---
we got a tall fc
---
Post your Lion killboard
---
Is no one going to talk about the contents of their cargo hold?
---
How many virtue pods were lost for this?
---
To both pilots: Have you trained customer service V? I am not a recruiter and am unable to speak to our hiring practices. If you'd like, I can attempt to get a recruiter in here.
---
Come do invasions with us.
---
I'm CEO of a small pirate gang in lowsec now. We shit fit and get in fights we shouldnt take in meta fits for the luls. But I appreciate the offer.
---
Nice use of clickbait catchphrases.
---
You got me, AT ships and office mod everything should smash everything
---
In CCPs defense, Eve is a massively hard game to balance. But they do drop the ball a bit too much in that department leaving extremely OP things in the game for a long long time. Blackout is just the latest addition to this.
---
iirc it was a honey based cake with a think layer of fondant

And on the other foot there are those who would be perfectly happy with a space pirate shooting sim. Undock, press their I WIN button and have a nice feedback system of QQ. Maybe even an eve skinned version of dreadnaught.
---
How many "hunters" have any idea who they are killing and what those people's goals are? They are playing the wrong game as well.
---
Thanks for adding instructions no how to enable Google Auth.
---
I'm really sorry to hear that! Is it anything you like to discuss? I'd love to chat with you about your reasons in person. Please stay uncloaked at the sun until I'm able to locate you.
---
I’m not recruiting yet as I don’t really know what the fuck I’m doing.
---
But I’ve never seen a C5 corp that’s apart of one of the FW militias so I’m gonna try that out.
---
We whelped a chemosh

Probably intentional.

no chat, no problems

Probably best to start over after 6 years.

This is not the place for customer support.

My cheeta blew up in a data site, apparantly I was in a special one. Downside was I finished the first one giving me a nice T2 BP, I could not find the site when I came back to find my wreck.

10 ventures per 0sec region is probably what eve needs ..
---
Reddit confirms account sharing you lost.
---
Not trying to step on toes, just asking if anyone has had experience with this.  Any advice?
---
Account sharing?
---
So you joined Predator
---
Yes, file a ticket, stop account sharing.
---
#implying wingspan agents actually uncloak to anything other than industrials.
---
You want to be the one killing drones? You can do that now, there is always some fool somewhere.
---
I've only ever played my accounts myself.  I'll just continue to wait on the ticket.  Wasn't trying to step on toes, been a week, and was reaching out.
---
True, but I do not feel that CCP really tried tho. Ive watched the Talking in Station interview, and I get the sense its a "roll the dice" with chaos, and see how it pans out.
---
Its fine to make radical changes, but it feels low effort, cheap and lazy, without looking if there are other aspects in need of adjustment due to such changes.
---
*Ammatar
---
Unfortunately, I'm rather obtuse at times and did not infer what you implied. It does seem like you could use a hug though. Would you like a hug?
---
Because null can't place 50 in the same system?

Who is fighting who? I have not heard about this battle.

#YOU’RE MISSING A PARENTESIS.
---
Well played Slicer pilot. Congratulations.
---
LuL tripwire LuL
---
so we had 2 simultaneous timers for a tcu in providence today.
---
Both spawned command nodes.
---
On the first set of nodes we completed 5 nodes
---
On the 2nd set of nodes we completed 1 nodes
---
then the enemy came and began winning nodes.
---
Since we completed 6 defensive nodes total before they completed a single offensive node, we should win the timer.
---
however since they were 2 different timers that was not the case.
---
always exciting to see new and unannounced game play changes.
---
its called bouncing back ;) 60 sec reload time each jump takes min 20 - 25 seconds depending how far  so one way and back is about an ancil reload o7
---
Yeah, is that why you’re posting recruitment ads anywhere but /r/evejobs
---
Upside of using steam created accounts, it already has great 2fa. And you cant log in without first logging in to steam.
---
Itls the first nulmsec nerf after 16 years of perfect local intel and incremental buffs to safety, I'm sure you can handle pressing dscan for a little while
---
Why were there two timers for the same TCU?
---
Now call your masters to come rescue you and leave the shitposting to the experts.
---
Vni, jaguar, comet, stabber (navy or regular), the navy omen is guchi, as you said. Try some t1 cruisers, most are good, one way or another.

Trig precursor ships are equipped with Entropic Disintegrators. They start off with rather low damage and every cycle it goes up by 5%. If you switch targets, get out of range, or the weapon stops firing for any reason it resets back to base damage.
---
Wormholes man. Skip all the boring shit and go to the top. Join spoopy newbies or something.

I think your issue is skills. Not fitting

Craigslist missed connection?

You were the nerd in front of all the spreadsheets, we talked briefly and you winked at me.. please respond with a contract..

incase OP doesnt know what DDU is, its Display Driver Uninstaller, a freeware that removed all traces of a discrete gpu driver, once you have used it, you want to in this case get geforce experiance and update to latest stable build via geforce not device manager

Unless your WH has a direct HS you probably won't see these guys.

Once you start looking at statistics you’ll subconsciously avoid fights.

Go onward and smash your ship repeatedly into something until it blows up. Then continue... #Forever.

Okay. As a new player who's exploring it took me a minute or two to get the joke.
---
Now, I have to admit, I'm grinning.
---
I prefer closely bastard tyvm
---
Newcomer to the game? I've been playing for 9 years now. Wow, you started a whole two years before me. Amazing. Can you name a specific instance Goons didn't keep their word in regards to diplomacy?
---
You claim that Init is our best allies. None of the other members of The Imperium are attempting to lawyer their way out of a diplomatic agreement that they approved.
---
Imperium would survive without Init. Init cannot survive without GSF.
---
Stats don't matter? Are you an Eve player? We love stats and numbers and lists and spreadsheet, dude.
---
Looks great other than the tri logo
---
Wangspin lmao
---
I am very sorry that you have been hurt. We at WINGSPAN are committed to you, our customer. What can I do to help you overcome your pain?
---
This is not a recruitment ad. I'm attempting to give hope to new players and explorers, encourage them to go out and explore New Eden, earning ISK and stimulating the economy in the process. I utilized what I would call "art" to facilitate this. My goal was not to recruit new players to WDS, if I did, I would only move further down the employee standings. I'm a very bad pilot.
---
art
---
/ärt/
---
noun
---
noun: art; plural noun: arts; plural noun: the arts
---
    1.the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power.
---
    "the art of the WINGSPAN"
---
    synonyms:	fine art, artwork, creative activity
---
    "Chance studied art"
---
If this has been misfiled, I will request that CONCORD inform me.
---
I agree. OP should never post again.
---
The +1% damage based on crew is some Forza 6 tier bullshit.
---
&gt; it seems to me to just give those who have those protective fleets more incentive to stay there. 
---
Yeah it's a human thing, not a gameplay design issue. There's always something that can be done to improve the game, but nothing will ever remove humans, generally form communities to protect each other. A drive to "make it dangerous" will drive people to increase safety.
---
Dope!
---
Did someone tell you a joke? That's great! Please feel free to share.
---
WINGSPAN would like to welcome you to New Eden. We'll keep an eye out for you.
---
It's my fist time trying to paint a ship, the logo didnt come out great but from afar its not too bad.
---
I remember using blender in the past to smooth moedls but tbh this one came our pretty good without.
---
Ye most def. That interview was really bad on multiple fronts. I mean, they clearly showed contempt towards a playstyle which they themselves created. Without taking responsibility for it but instead blaming the players. And saying its an age of chaos combined with the above is basically saying "youre gonna get fked for 18 months straight but at the end of it, we dont know if its gonna be a better game". I mean, its one thing to have balls but its another thing to be plain stupid.
---
Ye, I mean the main selling point for me with Eve has always been thats its a game of counters. That means low chance and high personal skill, something that is lacking in many other games. It also makes the extreme complexity of the game acceptable because you know that in time you will get better. I.e., the progression is rather endless. But making changes where your skill doesnt really matter anymore since some things now lack counters is a big no no, for me atleast. Imo that goes against the very spirit of what Eve is.
---
No the logo is fine but tri is not LMAO
---
Bruh get the fuck out. This whole game is one giant isk sink. Why do you think everyone krabs their god damn life away.
---
How do you miss that?
---
If you do see an agent, please let him know exactly how you feel!
---
Well you see, I was talking to another pilot and - haha - they were saying something about getting a *live* ammo delivery at considerable speed instead of nice and boxed up.
---
What a kidder.
---
You got an MWD, have you considered to change missiles for assault missiles? They might need more ressources, though.
---
Sacrifice range for DPS, you should be mobile enough with MWD.
---
I never did this in WH though, be careful.
---
Also... Missile support skills, check them out.
---
You should move to J-space...
---
Also stop posting. It’s bad.
---
You do realize the lion on top still manages to get kills
---
Got gud scrub
---
That would be terrifying. My latest performance review went poorly, unfortunately my ship fitting wasn't able to withstand customer feedback. I was pleasantly surprised that they took it upon themselves to retrieve the ordnance from my wreckage.
---
I don't have enough wh kills and went hunting for days to see just 1-2 DSTs. Missed bump on one sadly.
---
Alas. Blackout is incredible.
---
If I recall correctly both Vily and Boat warned that smaller Sov holders will end up merging with one of the bigger blocs. Mittens said he hoped the empty systems/regions around EVE will be filled with small entities they have vacated, but in the same broadcast they seemed less optimistic about the realism of this.
---
They also summarized "there are too much space in EVE", but that seems like a surrender to the fact that CCP has broken their own game.
---
Hilmar is correct in saying that a radical change IS needed, but more is needed beyond highlighting the "local code" and then press "Delete".
---
That’s because government services aren’t actually free like the stateists want you to believe. 
---
You pay more on average for “free” services than we do because individuals will always be able to get better prices than a captured government entity which has pledged that it’s going to buy something. Somehow people always coincidentally raise the prices on the government like no shame.
---
Don't worry, I will.
---
Well... no.
---
I mean is it reasonable for Armenia to attack Russia? Or Mexico to invade USA (not at least in Trump's head...)?
---
Because size (and numbers) does matter.
---
Is smaller groups wanna to attack bigger they must form something big and then think about it, otherwise it's nonsense.
---
Big groups are not tough because they are lucky or because some particular advantage they are because they have numbers, they put effort on the table by thousands of players...
---
Yep - missing punctuation is the cloaky camping of RL (subtly triggering people).
---
You, however, are missing an **H**
---
I didn’t come out insulting you, no reason to attack me.  Your father must be very disappointed to have a child like you
---
“Wingspan welcomes new players to exploration.”
---
You’re a long winded pseudo intellectual try hard trying to circumvent the rules with a silly picture.
---
Capital Ships shouldn't be PvE ships in the first place. A 5 man nano af gang shouldn't be able to kill a decent fit Rorqual but that Rorqual shouldn't be in a belt mining the equivalent of 6+ Exhumers, even if the price is commensurate. Boosting maybe, mining absolutely not.
---
What is that?
---
Stop posting about telling people to stop posting

Bro idk what people expect out of #cloaked ships.   
---
Like come on man. You can’t have tank, dps, and a cloak. T3’s aren’t god mode. And IMO the cov ops subsystem is used by cowards and people who fail at ganking.
---
Well, is blackout helping to drive conflicts? 
---
Not really. Ppl just dont play and go afk. 
---
If they want chaos... then maybe fix the fucking citadel timer mechanics so you cant timezone tank the shit out of everything  for when ppl are are work on a weekday.

---
Did you use a brush?
---
I believe that for a model like this, especially an object that is supposed to be "metal"; an air brush and model paint would be used.  They would use stencils and tape to mask out the details.
---
Even just masking tape and a quality rattle can would be a lot better for your lines.

models with a hand brush is fine, the paint he applied looks way too thick, thin your paint kids

Yeah this is all done by hand, just testing what I can do with just normal brushes and acrilic paint. Masking tape I a great idea tough.

How do you counter it?
---
Nobody knows more about Keepstars than me
---
Mwd + shield extender = big target. And yet youre trying to sig tank at least a bit. And the extender doesnt fit with the rest of the mids.
---
Also as it was well said below drop the covert subsystem for the tanky one. Will give u better durability. Consider carrying blue pill and xinstinct drugs as well for a performance boost in tankiness.

What do I need to take into account when moving in a T3C in hisec (excluding bookmarks)? Normally I move in a travel sunesis and I've never moved in anything big slow and expensive.
---
Is covops cloak alone enough to make sure my WH PvE legion won't get ganked? What about instalocking nados? Do I need to carry a separate travel fit etc?
---
We all know you didn't shoot the fort near as much
---
Tbh if he is ratting alone a cov ops isn’t a bad idea..
---
WCS are for travel fits. Don't use them on anything that needs to lock targets... they mess up your locking time.
---
High-sec wardec pilots generally are found camping trade hubs and the gates at choke points on the routes between them. Stay off the beaten path, have your overview set up correctly, and pay attention to your surroundings, and they are easily evaded. If you're doing high-sec exploration, your results will be a lot better if you stay in lower-traffic areas anyway.
---
These guys are generally too cowardly to drive their gank-fit solopwnmobiles through low-sec for even one jump, so if you can find a high-sec island of 8 or 10 systems you can go hang out there and never see one of them ever. It will be a better explo grounds than anyplace else in high-sec too, probably.
---
so CODE, but with at least enough guts to go someplace where people can shoot first
---
You aren't going to catch a Kiki. They are generally a lot faster than your Hecate and start with 300dps at ~40km, so they don't need to come in close.
---
I'm not doing napkin maths here. I have lost a lot of kikis and your scenario isn't likely. You'll just die after applying 0 damage.
---
you have to remember in wormholes, particularly when defending in a wormhole, ehp is relative, especially on caps. you barely need to fit buffer on a defensive cap because hostiles are pretty much limited to the one dread they can bring with them unless they're seeding for an eviction
---
in this case, as in most cases, talismans would have been more valuable than genos, because the ehp of a faction dread is largely irrelevant. resists are what matters, and it had two a-type invulns, so...
---
For what kind of wormhole ratting? For C3 it's nowhere near tanky enough to start with let alone the fact that the dps is very low. For C1/2 you'll want RLML rather than HAMs because of the bad application to the frigates that make up the bulk of what you encounter in those sites.
---
You want a cap stable smaller shield booster or a non cap stable larger booster (or to bling for a cap stable larger booster) you do not want a non cap stable smaller shield booster.
---
If you want to do C1/2 ratting use a Gila or a battlecruiser of some kind. If you want to do C3 ratting use a Praxis. Refit the Tengu for scanning down the holes you want to rat in and for opportunistic ganking and use a different ship for the actual ratting imo.
---
Vexor (potential Navy Issue)
---
Vexor?
---
General guidance is "use BCs for level 3s," and Stabber is not a great candidate for violating that. Using a cruiser, you will just trade time traveling between missions for time spent in the site, or warping off because you can't tank the rats.
---
BCs are stupid slow by comparison to smaller ships. Have a prop mod.
---
Agreed it's pretty dumb. :(
---
I would say the vni is alot less safer then most other activities of the same value. I wish people would stop picking on the little guys and adjust there anger on stuff like carrier/super ratting/incursions faction warfare and multi boxing rorqs. the guy thats gettting 13-15 mil ticks is not ruining the game

---
Watchu mean :( &lt;3
---
You seriously believe people want to be able to kill ratting supers with BCs? It's a ludicrous misrepresentation of what people actually want when they talk about the nullsec safety net.
---
Before the blackout, any krab that wanted to krab in peace has the deck stacked entirely in their favour. They have local chat, regional intel bots, rats that rarely ever tackle, and the knowledge that a defense fleet can form fairly quickly. The attacker has to deal with the delay in d-scanning anoms, warp times, decloak lock delays, before even getting on grid with the chance to catch anything. Ratting aligned in nullsec isn't low risk, it's *no* risk.
---
Blackout removed just **one** advantage the defender has.
---
And in the case of rorquals, even if the attacker does everything right, probes and catches the thing, gets hard tackle on it, and cynos in his buddies to kill it... the rorq can just press a button and give itself a free 4 minutes for his friends to come and save it. It's utterly brainless gameplay design that rewards the lowest effort possible.

That was pretty fucking sweet
---
Yea but this is a videogame, with shitloads of scifi tropes, and not a real life geopolitics sim. If it isn't fun for players seeking out a smaller scale playstyle they will leave and thus the game becomes step by step more boring.
---
And really how much effort does the average bloc linemember put into maintaining their space?  
---
Most linemembers don't hump fuel, maintain infrastructure, fc fleets, come up with new defensive concepts, are involved in important leadership decisions, etc.  
---
The average linemember logs in, shoots at a few rats, is x'ing up for a fleet, takes a titan bridge, is pressing f1 a couple of times and logs back out.  
---
It is tailormade to be easily accessible, with as little effort as possible.

---
Oh I see. Thanks for the explanation. There's so much to learn in this game that I'm trying to just ask people to clarify any small details that I don't understand, hoping it'll eventually all add up to some sort of competence. Thanks again!
---
you're probably overthinking it, if maximum efficiency was his goal odds are the money would be better spent elsewhere, I guess wormholes could have a better argument since mass restrictions but still. 
---
Its kinda like the faction titan/vendetta thing, there is no reason to not box a few titans/nyxes instead of using a faction one given how much more useful you'd be. It's still mind boggling people don't see ownership of these specific ships as shameful. I don't think this would apply all that well actually to these cause well, mass limits, so there's more of a reason to do so, but its the closer I was able to get to it. Guess what im trying to say is that its prob because he wanted one first and the application came second v0v
---
Whoever is stocking ships can thank us?
---
but now its the complete opposite when I log in I have no idea how many cloak campers are or could be in system they can then pick the time and location to engage me. I dont have a carrier or super or rorq not everyone flies in caps so super umbrellla isnt going to save me in my raven.
---
Tristans are fun.
---
&gt;Fact is, things were killed in massive amounts in NS before the blackout and arguably less now after it. It was never safe, saying it was is an outright lie that zkillboard can disprove in seconds. 
---
This line of arguing is really problematic, as you are not looking at the data properly. Overall number of kills is an unprecise measurment of how healthy NS is.  
---
First you should ask yourself what is the intended goal of the blackout (we can only speculate)?  
---
Let's say you want to introduce more fighting. And then f.e. if you see a downtrend in vni kills but an uptick in pvp ships dying you actually have achieved what you set out to do, despite having an overall loss in the total kills column.
---
The most depressing thing about this.

Our plan of seeding Australians in CCP comes to fruition. Your aggression against legacy is now being repaid

---
Its solid points. They broke the game and now theyre trying to make a soft reset by regressing the game. But its far too late for that. To do that you would need to nerf income, nerf supers/titans, umbrellas, caps, organisation, manpower and so on. However, if they do that then the game is dead because it wont survive the transition.
---
The only way forward is forward, to wade through the shit they created and finish building the new Eve. Ofc you can and should tamper with the above if need be but the idea of the old Eve has to go.
---
well shit
---
ngl got a bit of a chuckle out of me
---
T3Cs are fairly agile, but you shouldn't really worry about it getting ganked, as long as your corp isn't wardecced. Most gankers are after freighters and haulers that are carrying too much cargo, all usually around the Jita-Amarr pipe.
---
If you aren't wardecced, they won't pay attention to you. If you are, you can always send in an alt and check if your aggressors are there.
---
Cov ops cloak will protect against most ganks as long as your align time is fairly short, because gankers will often bump you to decloak you, if they see you as a valid target.
---
as someone who doesnt rat in a carrier or mine with a rorq I think I would be fine with the blackout if cloaks didnt exist.
---
Aligning is too hard eh?
---
You can get a bhaalgorn to be cap stable with 7 neuts and hg talismans, neuts about 500 cap a second before you take into effect the pulsar effects.

We arent talking about health, but rather about safety. 
---
I dont disagree that its speculation but I mean its only a handful of things that can result from it right? So its not really like we are trying to find new life on other planets kinda speculations. Educated guesses will work. Not disagreeing there either.
---
Same here.
---
But like I stated in the first line, its a response to OP regarding safety. NS was never safe. People keep repeating it like CCP has changed the rules about what NS is directly. They didnt, players instead used the tools given by CCP to make it into a safer area. But NS is still, at its core, a place where you can get killed without any mechanic to save you or punish the aggressor.
---
a 6 faction max skilled chemosh with hg talismans is neuting like 1555 cap a second before wormhole effects, but since in wormholes unless its an evection you will probaly only be facing at max 1 dread anyways its kind of pointless over using a bhaalgorn.
---
loosing 100 excavators per moon chunk
---
Then we will fight in the shade (?)
---
We live in Curse and like it.
---
If you're attacked by wardeccers, you are probably going to die very quickly, especially in a fragile destroyer or frigate, you probably won't be able to tank them. Your best bet is to avoid the systems close to trade hubs.
---
Also, for exploration, you're much better off in an exploration frigate. They will scan down sites faster and hacking the cans will be easier. Use a Magnate, Heron, Probe or Imicus. The best explo frigate is usually considered to be the Heron since it's 5 mids allow you to fit data/relic scanners, a cargo scanner (to only hack cans that are worth something), a microwarpdrive or afterburner and mods to help you scan signatures faster.
---
I also encourage you to do exploration in wormholes and null. Every site in null or wormholes net you a lot more than those in hisec. If you go in wormholes, only go to sites that have a pirate name in them (sansha, guristas, serpentis, etc.) and you'll be good.
---
Can we just sticky a live thread of us getting deleted?
---
you should start repping way sooner, lots of close calls where there didnt need to be. For most of these fights, you'd have been fine starting when you hit armor, instead of when you hit hull. for others, I'd have started repping a half second before I lose shield.
---
there is no other single ship with as much neuting power as a chemosh, and in wormholes the number of ships you can bring is a matter of some concern. a properly executed fight using one in a pulsar should have been able to shut down any hostile caps completely, unfortunately they didn't have subs, and the chemosh not being able to neut the bhaalgorns back would have killed him if the bad cap warp ins didn't
---
No idea how he pulled off such a slick fleet command move.
---
Man, wormholers are weird.
---
I would have to agree. VNIs and other combat subcaps are used by relatively lower level players (or bots, yeah yeah) for isk generation and that's totally fine. It's not an enormous amount, and they're much easier for average hunters to stalk, catch and kill. When I first started flying capital ships carriers had/have the most utility so I tried some ratting in it to get used to fighters, and I couldn't help but think it was somehow cheating. Farming in MMOs isn't supposed to be terribly difficult, it's a time waster to get you stay logged in, but the amount of isk generated with stupid ease is just ridiculous and that's just the bottom tier of capital isk-printing. I am openly disgusted by it.
---
how does that help vs cloak you dont think someone can lock you down before you hit the warp button
---
Holup
---
&gt;our raises are delayed again.
---
Chance never paid me, where do I sign!?
---
For me risk/reward balance is directly tied to the health of the game and it's ecosystems. But if you like you can replace "health" with "safe", it won't change the argument.  
---
I disagree that the current state of nullsec is unsafe. Yes, there is no game mechanic that automatically punishes your aggressor, and there are bubbles and some such.  
---
But the nullsec reality is that when you are part of a big alliance, you will be surrounded by friendlies and allies in a radius that will safely alllow you to dock before any potential aggressor can come even remotely close.  
---
If you contrast this with highsec, most areas will have an average of 5-10 players at all times, you can't judge their intent as there is quite a high variation of the players and groups you face.  
---
And even if it was the way that one of the goonposters in this thread claims that you simply need enough ehp to survive a gank, good old n+1 will take care of it.  
---
So in short your noise to signal ratio is ungodly high in HS, while being nonexistant in NS. This is also why near2 would never work in HS.
---
If you’re scared of getting ganked. You should be able to roll around in a cov ops fit. And then refit to your real ratting fit when you start sites.   With a mobile depot.

delete all weed brains, delete all autz
---
Great minds and all that - we’re differing only in minor particulars.
---
However - don’t leave that low slot empty! Toss in another Nano or an Overdrive to get something out of it! 
---
With another nano in that low slot, our differences are two (ignoring skill issues) - DC or No DC? And rigs to taste.
---
I chose more dps/alpha over a DC because the added shield resists from a DC, while helpful, are minimal and we already have an invuln, so when the major benefits of the DC start to come into play (the extra and better armor and hull resists) all it really means is that our tank is broken and we should be well on our way to GTFO already. 
---
Also, with only three RLML, our damage will always struggle and we want to pack as much damage in those 20 missiles as possible so we can kill shit before we have to wait out a brutal reload, which in solo play essentially means having to warp out. So in my opinion we add on damage mods whenever possible.
---
The rig is a matter of taste - your choice of extra range is quite good, my only argument against is that your target will just be that much more outside point range. With the long RLML reload you can’t waste a good portion of the clip of missiles to a target that just warps off before you can kill them. You are then left with a minimal damage amount available before you need to wait out the reload, and the target who just warped off now has plenty of time during that reload to repair their ship and come back.
---
Basically, while extra range is always good, when flying solo, you will probably have to close range to your target to get point eventually, and when you do that rig won’t be of any help.
---
 I chose the polycarb because with lvl V nagagation skills like on my toon, two nanos and a t2 polycarb bring your align time to 2.9 seconds w/o prop running (just over 4s w/prop) - which allows you to warp off of gates a tick faster, essentially at frigate speed, possibly allowing you to avoid some, but of course not all, gate camps; as well as for quicker locate-to-tackle times while hunting; and the extra speed/agility that makes you harder to catch while your clip of missiles is firing.
---
They mean it's too dangerous for them to go kill miners or ratters
---
I don't think it really matters at this point. Any suitably large and organized group can take whatever region and farm the fuck out of it with some few exceptions I'm sure. Goons are large enough that they are literally everywhere in the Eve doing whatever hooliganism is on the menu, so where "home" is makes little difference but for a fractional hit to the bottom line.
---
I like your style. You saw a losing battle and still fought 'til the end. It really looks like it was a good time. Am I flying with the wrong dudes?
---
Thanks for explaining why nobody in 0.0 except that one exception that proves the rule is NRDS.
---
Hisec is so safe that people routinely do incredibly dangerous things there, like use high value PvE ships with no support while large numbers of neutrals are in system.
---
Chance told me that our base rate is 0.00isk a week. He gave me a raise at 10000x current rate. I haven't had one since then. I'm just waiting to get my pay stub to review it. He said it was in my inbox but I haven't seen it yet...

I recently used a friend referral request to make an account for a friend of mine. He's played for about an hour though, and the 1,000,000 SP points are not banked into his character. Does he have to wait a certain amount of time, or finish the career agents or something before he gets access to those friend referral benefits?
---
Did you have to sand or apply primer before painting it?

Low isnt empty...must be a bug from evedroid export.  It has a dc in it.  My math and skills says 50k ehp taking into account one full load of cap boosters.  That is with standard blue pill of course.  The 3rd BC or a DDA didnt seem to be worth sacrificing the EHP insurance.  Ive seen the 2 nano fit as well and i can dig the agility...i plan on having both fits available depending on factors.  Fly dangerously mate o7
---
Additionally, this is a very heat intensive ship so getting your thermodynamics skills trained up is kind key.
---
You’ll always be overheating your XLASB and your invuln, your point will probably be overheated at some point, along with your MWD to either avoid getting tackled or to apply point before your target escapes. This leaves the LSE and cap boost as heat sinks so be sure to lay out your mid-slots appropriately - and put the empty high slots inbetween each RLML to also act as heat sinks!
---
Grab a bigger ship and get a good fit. :)
---
Id probably go for a destroyer and make sure to add armor or shields and the same guns. 
---
o7
---
Does this cost a lot? I’m extremely new to the game, I have like 140m ISK or something.
---
And you sound like a l33t lord who gets to decide what parts of the game are for which crowd.
---
*mine in the shade
---
The statistics are arguable, but moot at this point I think. You are absolutely correct that no one can erase all that SP and the accumulated assets in heavily fortified space without completely upending the game, a sure suicide for Eve. People really should accept that there is no elegant solution here. We can make small changes, but nullsec is built by players, not CCP, and it's been CCP's philosophy to leave players alone for the most part to do as they wilt. That libertarian bent has consequences that I see as more sociological in nature than mechanical.
---
People often pine away for the glory days of the past but that's not really useful with Eve being as venerable as it is. I remember when I first ventured and lived in null it felt like a *far* more precarious existence. It feels much less so now depending on where I am and that makes me a bit sad.
---
If only there was some delay between decloaking and being able to lock. Like some sort of "sensor recalibration delay".
---
Clearly  [looooongneck.png](https://youtu.be/uX2nMucTJsw)
---
Hmm.... its been a while since Ive been in HS; I think you can get a destroyer and fit for less than that. PM me your in-game name and when Im by my computer Id be happy to add you + share a fit.
---
Whoa....TIL....i didnt know that trick.  Im still new but im gonna be doing that layout trick for sure
---
Kool!
---
Okey by replacing the word I get your point. I dont however agree with with the assumption that just a specific type of PvP means the game is healthier. Thats very much a biased assumption. But ofc, if you want to measure a specific thing you need to actually measure that.
---
And also, still, safety is inherently different than health. The discussion was about safety and that means the ability to die. That ability has always existed.
---
I never stated that nullsec isnt unsafe, I stated that its not inherently safe. If you are not in a big alliance then the factors that make you safe are gone which makes you unsafe.
---
Dont disagree. 
---
Same here. 
---
But the point is that its due to organisation and not something that is found in any random NS system in which you are living solo. 
---
We are not on different sides of this. But I do acknowledge that my including of the word blackout can create an alternate discussion. Which is why I wrote arguably since it wasnt my intention to make this about the blackout. 
---
When it comes to the blackout then ye, I mean I dont disagree with you that total kills dont mean that much (its not totally irrelevant tho). Its data, you always need to analyse it further before it actually can yield relevant conclusions.
---
&gt; the number of ships you can bring is a matter of some concern
---
not necessarily, the matter of some concern is the aggregate mass of said ships
---
&gt; a properly executed fight using one in a pulsar should have been able to shut down any hostile caps completely
---
not really, those caps function on cap injection, neuting is important for sure, especially on a pulsar, to guarantee it gets to that but its hardly a case of "shutting them down completely". their sustain is still the amount of cap charges im pretty sure. Doesn't seem to be super worth it tbh taking into brawls

You can see 5000 items, and currently order by most value (ignoring blueprints and skin value, they appear aas a litle minus )
---
Can’t be too old; isn’t that the newer ship model?
---
99% uptime over 16 years is pretty impressive
---
No clue. It was a random number that will be too low.

*BB would like to know your location*
---
It depends on your personal interests and what skills you already have (training stuff from zero as alpha would be painful as fuck).
---
You can get frigate/dessy/cruiser to lvl 4
---
You can get small/medium turret to 5 (can use scorch etc)
---
You can get T2 small drones, faction medium drones
---
You're heavily limited in trading, production, PI etc...
---
Your biggest handicap for PvP are probably nav. skills, any kind of kite/range control fit in pvp will suffer unless you have dual web (eg. alpha slicer is horrible).
---
I'd recommend looking at this page for the skill categories and their limits
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Skills_and_learning
---
Hey mate if I was you I'd put a probe launcher on that bad boy and do some highsec combat sites, it's not huge money but it gets you going in the right direction. Also for fit wise fit a passive tank and a drone range module should keep you outside range for most of the guns NPCs are using
---
k
---
Doesn't the military career agent/advanced give you a destroyer for free? I remember getting a catalyst off them when I started
---
140m isk for an extremely new player is extremely ok.
---
&gt;I suppose in the lore these connections always exist
---
And the Drifters know they exist... which leads to the really brainfucky thing of Drifters warping to K162 wormholes that haven't spawned yet, letting you Combat Probe them down, and find wormholes that don't exist on the probe scanner because nobody scanned down their real entry side.
---
There's a set of mechanics that *really* doesn't make sense
---
What ship are you using?
---
I was able to get through all the career and levl1 missions with a AB kite Tristin.
---
Get moving, in any mission you need to make measures to negate incoming damage.
---
Ok retard
---
Well put.
---
There is no longer an elegant solution to this problem and people are focusing way too hard to find one. And its only a problem if one perceives it to be as such. And people perceive it as such since its too big of a difference from what the old Eve was. 
---
However, that Eve died several years ago. We need to find a new way forward building on what we currently have instead of trying to resuscitate the old one. And Im very optimistic about this new ones chances, but people need to start living in the current game, CCP most of all. 
---
I imagine this new Eve to be a place where small gangs can find small gang content whenever they feel like in a vibrant LS. A NS which fights in NS, where a group with all the accumulated advantages goes against groups with the same advantages. A HS that actually fulfills its purpose of being a real starter zone resulting in higher retention rates that make the game more fluid. And so on. (Dunno much about WHs so Im not mentioning it out of ignorance and not out of spite or opinions regarding it.)
---
I firmly belive this can happen. But people need to get with the program, especially CCP, instead of trying to solve what cant be solved. What I argue isnt even a problem, but rather a question of perspective.
---
C3 Prax fit please?
---
I know and thats also the feeling I had after my first few Pvp fights. People were very nice and telling my what I possibly made wrong or why they won the 1v1. Had quite nice and informative convos after those fights for hours sometimes. :)
---
I have an incursus, I got it years ago when I used to play as I got some help with fittings ect.
---
right click the fitted gun in pyfa and you'll get something akin to "number of cycles" or some shit, you can select the amount of cycles it ramped up there and get a better dps number
---
Fit 125mm/150mm rails, a afterburner, tracking computer with tracking script, damage control, EANP,and small armor rep.
---
Orbit at 15-20 km with AB, turn on tracking computer, and kill them all
---
 I do not recommend playing this shit.    
---
CCP destroyed their game.
---
You've got a name really like this walleater guy in game.
---
This seems excessive.
---
You should be able to fit a Catalyst or Algos for around 15m, Cata is turrets, Algos uses drones, for both fit AB and orbit as your kill them from afar with rails or drones.
---
i didn't reply to you my m8, not sure who you are trying to message there..
---
It'll continue to change a little more, and I hope it continues in a mostly forward direction. Eve, like every capsuleer, must adapt or die :)
---
Super umbrella be like: "Allow us to introduce ourselves"
---
What are some good replacement ISK-making activities similar to null krabbing now that anyone in anything smaller than a carrier isn't going to get saved from hunters in null? I liked orbiting sites because I could watch my kid or just do some other stuff while passively making ISK that funded the fun fleets and pvp, but I was so complacent in that activity always being there that now I'm not really sure what else is out there.
---
Station trading is all well and good but damn does it get frustrating updating orders all the time, and I must be stupid or something because I'm having a hard time finding good arbitrage that everyone mentions being the alternative to trying to beat bots or other .01 isk'ers.
---
140 mil will easily get you an L1 fit, I did em in a corax or cormorant when I was new. Ask in your corp chat in game and people will help you out
---
Beans know undock is 50-50 whelp from being bombed by VG to other assorted reasons. Insurance and insta looting are hard ingrained skills. F1 pushing is more down the order of things id say. Regardless, well played, well played.
---
Well played boyos.
---
They are in the Redeem Items section. When you first login, before you pick the character, they are at the bottom of the screen. Or in game there's a menu option to see them, or a gift box in the lower left.
---
Cool thanks. I looked and found a Vindicator fit I could get into fairly quickly.
---
You just have to make him a small payment of 0.00 isk, and he'll double it !
---
Yep! I don’t remember which one it was. You definitely get a destroyer though.
---
Yeah ..... Citizen Bob just wait for it. Last time he decided to be funny and for 3 months he was just cycling me between 2 wh...
---
fitting because dealing with bomber's bar is a piece of cake, am i right?
---
BUY, CONSUME, OBEY!!!
---
Wrong. Ratting is generating new isk. Mining dont do it, unless you just build BS hulls, insure them and just self desruct them for isk
---
Yeah it's bad...  but rather he lose it and learn than just never know how to fit a ship. Regardless, pyfa says skills are the issue with the primary concern (dps).  I'd imagine its subsystem skills.
---
Ahh yes brave TAPI and pets against the world. Wait this narrative has been dead for how long now?
---
Thank you Kanye, very cool!
---
Always thank your boosher 👍
---
They should play elite dangerous. It’s perfect for them.
---
What? Should people have a biography of the person they are killing?
---
To be honest, if your name is Julian it's probably pretty reasonable to doubt your heterosexuality.
---
I played the game when it was first released as a beta and then the full release. Gorgeous game but the world was devoid of any life. It’s just boring.
---
the average american watches more TV than that a day lol
---
- Ability to catch stuff - with local, if you're paying attention you can tell exactly when a potential threat comes into system, and anoms don't hold you down, so there is no way anyone can stop you being able to warp off.
---
- Safe havens in every system - with citadels you can always warp onto a tether on a friendly system, in your own space.
---
- Instant response fleet - a defender cyno can drop capitals on any fight immediately, and inhibs are ineffective at countering that.
---
Loosing?
---
Evictus alliance best alliance
---
Im not entirely shure if you are trying to troll me, or if you are as stupid as it seems
---
The moment you get something of value from nothing, you are generating it.
---
Minerals, even unprocessed ores have an ingame value and can be sold on the market, therefore you are generating isk.
---
You are generating isk, because there is an infinite amount if said valuable ores (they respawn every downtime after all).
---
If the amount of minable ores was set to a specific number, you would not generate isk, but relocate it and change it's form.
---
Since the ores always respawn, you are generating isk by mining it
---
Oh my lord he actually put heavy missiles on his tengu
---
8 bombers were hit, out of our 110 man fleet :) Thank you booshers!
---
Almost like that was the joke here.
---
&gt; it's been CCP's philosophy to leave players alone for the most part to do as they wilt
---
I'm sorry, what? CCP has made many changes, especially in the past 5 or so years, that have had large effects on nullsec. This libertarian fantasy doesn't exist. The sandbox has always been guided by rules and design and balance. As much as people want to believe in players creating content for players, it's absolutely fundamental how CCP designs the sandbox for what that content ends up looking like. There's no vacuum. The current situation is the direct result of CCP's decisions and changes made in past years.
---
This thread amused me enough to make my Saturday work day a little better. Thanx for that!
---
There's nothing there :(
---
😐
---
I liked killing the auctioneers.
---
Up to 7 years, the redesign was in spring 2012...
---
Yep... We got old(er) ;)
---
What!?! I now wonder if the same happened to me.
---
What you doing these days Halen?
---
Real-world empires have historically had trouble controlling their furthest territories, and overexpansion has even lead to the fall of some. Why couldn't there be something that set a "capitol" for sov territory, and then the more territory claimed, or the further from the "capitol", the harder it is to hold? Less time to conquer a system, benefits/penalties/modifiers, etc?
---
Smaller countries have been using all types of asymmetrical warfare since the dawn of man. From spying, to information warfare, propaganda, malware, hacking, terrorist acts, guerrilla fighting, etc. 
---
There are plenty of ways a smaller nation can harass a larger nation, while staying far enough away from casus belli so that large-scale war is not joined.
---
&gt; Players who are dependent on others for defense are always going to gravitate to safety.
---
Yup. This is basic geopolitics. Its the post-Westphalian Balance of Power.
---
Chill my dude. Isk is a currency. Value is not.
---
Ore can be traded for isk, but can’t create it.
---
You are not generating isk by mining.
---
yeah not that thats what i meant at all but whatevers
---
Intelligence tools should be things like dscan, actually watching a gate, and spies. There are far too many tools, as you mention, for gathering information from outside sources. Local was one. Killboards etc is another.
---
The 750k used to show up right away, so I'd open a ticket.
---
that actually isn't the worst shuttle fit I've seen
---
Thats actually pretty good.
---
Nice work booshers.
---
The only way possible, you stop you die.
---
Projectiles have proton ammo. It's kinda shit so not used and well known
---
And all hisec ships and items in stations get destroyed.
---
Same with lowsec
---
Oh and if you used a cloaking device for more than 12 hours in the previous purge your wallet gets emptied by concord as a non contributor to the war.
---
Also since drifters live in wormholes they wipe those too in retaliation.
---
Am i doing it right dad?
---
What a surprise that the Tranquility Trading Tower raised their taxes just before this happened. It's almost as if they used insider knowledge about a change happening and acted on it early knowing the REEEE would die down once the NPC taxes were changed.
---
Fuck me
---
Didn't want that Ferox anyway
---
It's been that long?? Good god i need to get laid.
---
i think they're going for the angry sort
---
Don't forget that for every $$$ to 'donate' to CCP, they will allow you to asset safety 1B.
---
Gotta hit those revenue targets somehow!
---
Evict popsy pls
---
THIS
---
Ye exactly. the real issues are still going unnoticed (atleast it feels like it). 
---
All the changes that have been talked about seem to only serve the purpose of hurting NS just for some naive wish of returning Eve to its former glory. But in reality all its gonna do is hurt a large portion of the players and more so the smaller guys than the big guys. And the game will never return to what it was, no matter.
---
NS needs change, no doubt. But so does everything else and just focusing on NS with bad changes isnt gonna get the job done.
---
Well,... I see creating something of value from nothing as printing money (and I said that it's basically like printing money since I'm aware of the steps one has to take to get actual isk from minerals)
---
No, they are not related to it.
---
Broker fees in a structure are set by the owner. There is no base NPC part in the broker fee in a structure.
---
The minimum taxation relates to the Sales Tax (also known as Transaction Tax). The minimum this can be was previously 1%, now it is 2.5% with Accounting V.
---
The broker fee changes only apply within an NPC structure.
---
I think you're sort of making my point for me. Not just purgers, but the equivalent capacitor rigs for active fits (CCCs?). Which leave no room for the damage or resist rigs you want for PVP.
---
And like I said, I advise OP that flying a gimped fit on your money-making ship to use it in PVP is a losing proposition.
---
Killboards are good archives and records of achievements. Live kill updating shouldnt be a thing though.
---
Ahh, the timeline was awful close so couldn't remember lol.
---
Clearly I should've invested in a Ferox BPO years ago...
---
Find someone to do frig abyssals with
---
Mission group?
---
It’s mostly just falcon on social media talking to us
---
But that doesn't match the first two: 
---
* Maximum Sales Tax increase from 2% to 5%.
---
* Minimum Sales Tax increase from 1% to 2.25%.
---
I updated my formulas and they match in game to these values for sales tax. I just don't get what the other thee bullets mean. If total minimum taxation on NPC Structures is 5.25%, then why is the max sales tax bullet say 5%?
---
To someone who just wants to acquire more and more and plays the game like an empire builder, sure, you're probably right. 
---
To someone who logs into the game to find good fights on the regular instead of PVEing, I think being in PanFam, or roaming in PanFam space is the best option. And you're basically saying the same here, so cool!
---
Would definitely give people a reason to fight for once.
---
Minimum sales tax (After training accounting V) is 2.25%
---
Maximum sales tax (if you have no skills) is 5%
---
Hence "Increase the minimum taxation on player owned structures by 125% from 1% to 2.25%."
---
It is nice to seeing you Redline XIII. I miss your goonswarm fleet operations. You are a skilled Fleet Commander.
---
Chaos... Consume us!
---
Fuck go back
---
dude you really need to go and hug someone and maybe find something more to do like go outside and have a good day. didn't think i complained about the results, the numbers, or anything besides the freak incident that happened. but whatever floats your boat my dude, i hope you find some happiness somewhere.
---
no idea, was petitioned but usually ccp don't interfere in sov warfare in any way, so i doubt it will fix anything.
---
Smooth.
---
Oh yeah ;)
---
Brilliant, but to hide it it can be a pilots service PURCHASED with plex!
---
Eve infinity war. Hilmar snaps his fingers and half the universe facepalms
---
CaptainObviousAndCo :D
---
Isn't that what contracts are for?
---
The kind with the biggest, blackest dildo you can find. Then get the elephant version.
---
You are missing the point we are talking about reducing isk generation.        
---
Ratting creates isk from thin air, by selling ore you get isk , but the one that is already in the system. So no new isk is created
---
Ratting in a subcap is pretty cancerous right now unless you're bait fit. A safer route to money right now as a low isk/SP player is salvaging used anoms with a destroyer or chilling in ore anoms with a rorq fleet.
---
Materials are destroyed when ship blows up. Same when you stock up stuff. Like can with 50 bil in mods you want to use.        
---
Isk is harder to remove
---
Yes hi it's me, I'm the builder.
---
Here's what I don't understand why are we taxed?
---
Is it just to slow down how much you can make or do we get something back in return?
---
Now we can shit up every local!
---
Thanks for the breakdown.
---
So basically the lowest fees you can pay at Jita 4-4 (does this include standings?) is 5.25%
---
The minimum you can pay at a player owned structure (POS?) is 2.25%.
---
So with perfect skills and excellent standings you're still going to be paying over double to trade at an NPC station like 4-4 assuming there is a nearby structure that is trading at 2.25%.
---
I don't trade at TTT because I don't want to feed the coffers of the big blocks.  So this means I just have to decide if I'm ok paying 3% in order to avoid giving goons/test/Panfam money.
---
I think legacy pings a little more than FRAT. I also think CTA means different things in either alliance / coalition.
---
Even in the "spread out each cycle" iteration that is completely and utterly broken. Overheating is a pretty dang important part of combat and something like that would neuter it to an unpleasant degree.
---
Salvaging wrecks in a wormhole and a few of the wrecks tell me "intermediate wreck too difficult salvage." Is this down to my t1 salvaging modules? Or Salvaging level? (I'm at Salvaging III).
---
Cool, haven’t redeemed my event Prax yet, so I just gotta get the mods, I’ll try it, probably puts out more DPS than my Gila too.
---
bomber fleet had command destroyer support, so when the titans spooled up their lances, one of the command dessies used their microjump field generators to "boosh" the entire fleet 100km, and out of the way of the lances.
---
*Ammarian would be the correct terminology.
---
&gt; The Ammatars are descendants of Minmatars that collaborated with the Amarrians during the latter occupation of the Minmatar worlds.
---
Best booshers in the game @ Bombers Bar
---
Ratting in the blackout in something that is not a carrier+ is no longer really viable, especially with the smaller ships. It's just a suicide trap for new people right now. Mining is okay I imagine if you can find a fleet for it, safety in numbers plus Rorqs make mining more profitable.
---
I personally am thinking about trying WH stuff again, or maybe Abyssal stuff (that specifically I'm doing tonight, it looks more engaging than most other solo PVE stuff).
---
This is all just my perspective as a new player who started recently.
---
You put a lot of time grinding
---
Evictis alliance pet allaince.. ftfy
---
Honestly, there's a shit tonne of ways. Start small, huff has in wormholes as it offers great reward vs risk and is easy to get into.  In your casual timedo discovery to get a marshal bpc, build capital and start trading, pay someone else to move your shit and assume bugger all risk. If you wanted to pve, make your goal subcap and eventually dread ratting in c5 space. 
---
These are the activities that offer best risk vs reward in the game next to high end trading and C6 sites.
---
&gt;Remove static orebelts
---
You've never mined in nullsec haven't ya
---
Null Sec in the current blackout isn't safe at all. 
---
The meme comes from cynos letting standing fleets drop supers on people at a moments notice, but that usually only happens for tackled supers.
---
Most groups won't drop for you if you're not in a super, and will more likely tell you to die quietly or however the meme goes.
---
You think it's reasonable to need a hundred goddamn pilots to kill *one of the most popular krabbing ships in nullsec*?! One that, regardless of how much you have on field, still has a 4-min invulnerability window to have his friends come to the rescue.
---
You're right out of it
---
Concord.
---
Work your way up missions or exploration till you have enough isk and skills to live in jspace or run incursions/invasions.
---
Do extraction PI in j/null, or factory PI in hi-sec.
---
I know people that make PLEX and billions extra building ships, invention, and making BPCs.
---
You could do a lot of trading too, I don’t have a orca/freighter yet, the idea of flying it around HS makes me want to pull my hair out, but just going about buying low and selling high is a thing.
---
I have 1B in PI stuff someone was selling at 75-80% Jita buy, I bought it all without thinking about HOW to get it to Jita.
---
Nice boshing
---
Sure, swap panic for not needing to be sieged. Deal.
---
It's 2.5 exhumers. Not 6+.
---
With anomalies and moons does anyone mine belts anymore? That’s where mining was in 2008.
---
Jeveassets works perfectly fine for a lot of people. Y'all are just a mess.
---
It's down to a mix of both, you can get around this by fitting salvage tackle rigs instead, with three t1 rigs you'll be able to salvage anything even with level 3 salvaging.
---
I-stabs and nanofiber have served me better.
---
Ultimately it means that it is seen as too safe for people in large empires... as in.. a group of 5 to 10 nerds can't go attack a 1000 man group without penalties. It is too deadly for them and that's not happy fun time for those 5 dudes that want to be able to kill anything they encounter if they are "good" at the game.
---
Not enough people playing to balance out the risk reward that nullsec is supposed to provide
---
Do not start again. Absolute waste of time.
---
It would depend on what your trying to do.  If you want to start over, you should skill extract your old toon to responsibly skill inject the new one.
---
It's an economic sink, also known in other MMOs as a Gold Sink, it's a tool to remove currency from an economy that is capable of generating an endless amount  currency and thus fight inflation. I'm still new to the game (3 months) but apparently inflation has really picked up recently; so CCP is trying to adjust their sinks accordingly to help combat the inflation.
---
Even then, one retarded avatar shot in the wrong direction.
---
VG never gonna live that down.
---
Pays for concord, aka we would lose any form of chat communication and also die for realsies when we die. Also, Highsec would just be full of drifters and we wouldn't get paid bounties for killing anything, seeing as concord has no money
---
CCP already tired this idea, what we have now for overheating is what they ended up with. Yes the idea of offensive heat was discarded. Imagine the salt. 
---
So do it.
---
I haven't been able to log in for like a couple of weeks.  What's the deal?

1 bil liquid is a broke mofo

Are you part of wingspan because if you are that’s why you don’t get the joke.
---
&gt;withstand customer feedback. 
---
Never thought of it that way before, lol
---
The honest to Bob real answer for funding two accounts is with a real world job. You can't beat the isk/hr efficiency of it.
---
Obviously that's not what you want to hear, so in game the best isk/hr for a newbro is null sec relic sites. Its not skill intensive and with an investment of 5 million isk you can be bringing in 100 mill per hour conservatively (the actual payouts vary wildly to the point where you can make 1 bill in a short night but I would say 100 mill per hour is easily done with minimal skills). The caveat being you have to scan so before you invest in any other skills you would do well to get your scanning skills up first.
---
Guys down in indy: “U wot, m8?”
---
Thats why i told it.
---
Skill extract how do I do that
---
C'mon man there are already so many ways to stop someone with ewar let's not add more cancer.
---
Buy raw mats for less than the value of the processed mats. Process the raw mats. Sell the processed mats. 
---
I made 500b doing this in hisec over a period of about 2.5 years.
---
Bait with falcon ;D
---
Either go to jita 4-4 or perimeter TTT (the keepstar) and buy skill extractors. The. You can use them an picking a skill you want to take out.  You will lose some skill points but at least your old toon doesn’t go to waste.
---
Thanks, I'm not sure why they made it so confusing.
---
Well if you can stop being disabled long enough to learn something new you will realize you are dealing in opinions while I offer straight facts. 
---
Imagine for a moment a real world government that owes $22 trillion to various creditors. Suddenly comeing to it's senses, the government decides to get out from under this crushing debt. It finds the options for getting out of debt are very unpopular. Spend less, or raise taxes.
---
Suddenly someone has a great idea. We are the government. We aldeady print the money that everyone uses. What if we go beyond just replacing old worn out currency and print an extra $20T and use that to erase our debts? What can go wrong? 
---
The answer of course is hyperinflation. More dollars chaseing the same goods vastly increases the cost of those goods. Hyperinflation is bad. Google it, you don't want it.
---
Now back to eve. Every time a ratting bounty is paid, every time insurance is paid, every time you sell loot to an npc... The server creates isk out of nothing. It prints isk. We call this an isk faucet. Every time you buy skillbooks, pay taxes and broker fees at npc stations like jita (but not upwell structures like perimeter), or buy items from the lp store that require isk in addition to lp the server destroys that isk. We call these isk sinks. Ideally the faucets and sinks match up so the players have a steady money supply. We don't have that though. Faucets have been buffed and sinks nerfed to the point where we should be seeing silly amounts of inflation. Yet with one exception, we aren't. 
---
Why? The answer is that the material markets are oversupplied even worse than our isk stores. The age of multiboxed rorquals under supercap umbrellas has pushed so much ore into the system that we aren't exploding ships as fast as they can be mined and built anymore. Not even close. In fact, t1 hulls including capitals have gone down in price. 
---
The most visable consequence of this is the price of plex. I remember when less than $300m isk could buy you a month of game time. Now it's often over $2b isk for a month. Less visable is the proliferation of capital ships in this world where isk making is easy and ore is disgustingly cheap. Everyone has caps now, which invalidates 95% of eve's ship catalog. 
---
TL;DR: Faucets and sinks have nothing to do with your personal wallet. They have nothing to do with isk that you give or get from another player. They are by definition only player &lt;-&gt; npc interactions. Mined ore and modual drops are not isk faucets.
---
Do not start fresh, I was trying to do it with a alpha account so I know what new folks are going through and see what FW as a alpha is like.
---
One week in I found a OLD toon I made in 2006 with a 14-day trial that somehow has 2M SP with, racial frig, gunnery, and drones already to V, I dropped the new toon like it’s hot.
---
Just committed the 250k SP from the event last month to her and things are taking off much faster.
---
How many SP do you have?
---
This.
---
Each XL structure would be a major point of conflict in taking a whole region, with the loss of them clearly signaling the loss of the entire region on a morale level.
---
IWarp core stab will impede you and increase the time you will spend uncloaked ( because that will reduce you range and the time to lock containers)
---
My advice is to go i-stabs , lowest align time possible, and to watch DSCAN /overview like a hawk. Do not hug containers, be ready to warp at moment's notice. Learn paranoia: if you don't feel it, don't hack it.  That served me well
---
Gas mining in wormholes. Find a decent hole and scan the sites with an explo frig, clear them of npcs with a praxis, and then you can afk mine in a venture for a while. You will have to drop the gas off in safe space every so often, but that’s not too much harder than moving between anoms was
---
Hey halenark, kognac here, hope you are well
---
Read the fine print. The more SP you have and inject the less you get from each injection. So extracting from one character and injecting to another you start to get less and less return as you go.

Oh, I'm not saying a pve ship can reasonably pvp without gimping either pvp capability or money making capability, we can both agree on that. Even a pvp fit Tengu can technically run C3s, but not as efficiently as if it was fit for pve.
---
What I'm saying is that your initial argument that the rigs are the issue is very incomplete and sometimes incorrect, because not all pve ships will fit Field Purger rigs and they might even have the correct rigs that you would use on a pvp ship, then the choice of modules decides how effective the ship is at either at pve or pvp, usually cap stability decides how good a ship will be, but not always.
---
Well they still have NPC mining fleets a stuff, are easy for new people to find, and gives you more places to warp to in a panic.
---
hey, that's my idea !

Maybe if it was called cation blaster then we could conclude that it is the proton blaster but for all we know it could be anion.

What phishing attack can get my 2fa info? Even with my passwors, they need to fiure out my 2fa or be doing it from my house/computer.
---
This is the real vulnerability and how hackers usually do it. They auhenticate with ccp from the email and now get to set up new password and 2fa if they want. 
---
2fa on the email is key, not an option.

Too bad there isn’t an in game chat channel so you guys could blare some ridiculously annoying music while dropping on aggressors.

You can only extract everything over 5m SP, those will be stuck there forever.

The extractors cost $5 or 400m isk each.

you gave them esi access

I like Authy, they save my encrypted keys to their cloud server.

That's why someone asked “why my credit card information got stolen” when they pay through some website like getfreemoney.com
---
There is a difference between sales tax and brokers fees. 
---
For Brokers Fees, Structures with markets (e.g. TTT) have really low broker fee rates, which they set and aren't affected by skills or standings.  NPC stations have a base level of 5% for broker's fees, which you get down by broker relations, faction standing, and corp standing of who owns station. I get 3.21% broker's fee in Jita 4-4 (almost 4 faction standing, and 9.5 corp standing). Note: you can get the fee down lower in FW space if the system is upgraded - currently I see 1.64% in the station I'm currently at even if I don't get how it's actually calculated.
---
For Sales Tax, the lowest minimum you can get is 2.25% in a structure or a station.   
---
For your concerns, you need to find out what you are doing - selling, buying, or orders of the two. Here's the differences:
---
•	Buy - When you buy something off the market (Buy from someone’s Sell Order – So Minimum Sell), you don’t pay taxes or broker fees
---
o	No Tax, No Broker Fee
---
•	Sell Order - When you set up a sell order, you pay broker fees up front and taxes for items when sold. (This will be min sell usually)
---
o	Tax, Broker Fee
---
•	Buy Order - When you set up buy order, you pay broker fees up front but no tax when someone sells to you. (This is max buy usually).
---
o	No Tax, Broker Fee
---
•	Sell - When you Sell to a buy order (simple sell), you only pay taxes. (This will be Max buy)
---
o 	Tax, No Broker Fee
---
Legacy leadership also likes lying to their line members / pets
---
And really I’m much more concerned with my bank, paypal, and business accounts, use 2FA on as much as you can, the time and hassle is worth it over a breach.
---
you log into their thing and click accept, giving them access to see your shit
---
Wait these guys deliver ammo to Wormholes?
---
Colonisation would be cool. Theres so much novelty item things like dancers, janitors and other things. If capsuleers could basically setup a colony where they need to basically import a whole heap of stuff to setup, run and maintain, its be cool.
---
Change PI so that you drop a command centre on a planet, and then have to build it up over a week, bringing supplies, providing isk, and choosing how it should set itself up. High maintenance/high reward scaling down to low maintenance/low reward. Login once a day vs login every 7 days. 
---
Rework customs offices to be orbital backyards, go there to collect your stuff, limit to cruiser sized industrial docking only, no tether. 
---
If you're looking to take over space, you attack the dock yard and put up your own and then "land" invasion forces to clear out other colonies. 
---
Planet owners will have to garrison and then the invasion forces are limited by a combat width system similar to HOI4 or Stellaris. Let it play out over a few days. Lvl 5 max defence lasting maybe 7 days, and a colony just started last like 1. Successfully dominated colonies enter an abandoned mode for three months allowing owners to return and reclaim the system and rebuild.  
---
CCPlzzzz, hint hint, nudge nudge, ;)
---
The only ways isk is created is through bounty payments, missions, and insurance(?). 
---
The only isk sinks are broker fees, taxes, and sov fees. 
---
They need them to keep isk in balance.
---
Yeah, we should have some crazy, random shit like this in eve. Fun zones of a sort.
---
May ccp see this!
---
Oh lmfao nevermind I'm just dumb
---
At no point has anyone said, ever, that CCP hasn't changed the game over time, in fact itll keep changing and continue to change no matter how hard people stomp their little feet about it.. Your "sandbox" standard seems to be pretty extreme. "Here is this world for you to build and make war in. We will not be changing anything henceforth. Go nuts. You are on your own. That'll be $15/mo."  Please.

Also it refuses to work with python encoding set to UTF-8... :(

Really important to note that refining does not usually see a profit until you start getting your efficiency up. I'd say a good goal skillwise to start profiting from refining would be tier III on whichever ore-specific skill you are refining currently. Basically, if you can put a mining crystal for a given ore on your mining ship, then you're going to make ISK on refining.

Did you, per chance, submit a ESI

---
That escalated quickly...
---
Blackout was their way of covering up broken local in null that they could never fix! Now you guys just never even know when its broken. Brilliant 5d chess move on ccp's part.
---
Do something well that no one else is doing very well.
---
Once again, havin the amount of people you need in subcaps to actually counter a 50-150 man bomber fleet that come to Delve EVERY WEEKEND, would be around 50-100 people ready to go at any time. That is what we would need to secure grid before we would even consider warping caps anywhere. 
---
Yeah if its like a few guys in a 5-10 man gang then less subcaps are fine but with the amount of stuff we get regularly.... I can tell you your idea is trash and should just be tossed in the trash
---
Tengu - found your problem right here
---
Trading lp+ isk for an item in a lpstore is a lesser know isk sink but kinda considerable in leagues some of the farmers operate
---
So.. you wanna make a profit mining you say.. join a nullsec alliance and mine moons with them, you will make a huge profit. But in terms of regular ore its mercoxit, ABC ore and spod/gneiss. Yes its worth mining because scalability for mining is massive. Also this game needs people in industry so pvpers have ships to fly. So mine and fly dangerous.
---
That is, in fact, a mighty boosh.
---
What’s the bombers bar?
---
I worked the login of "unitary particules name" to work the kind of gun.
---
So, if there is the electron and neutron, and another one name a Ion, then its a Hydrogen Ion, so, a Proton.
---
Buy an MTU, put some salvage drones in drone bay. Drop MTU when you land at site. Loot and salvage after you’re done. It takes time but salvage can net you big bucks. Could even buy 2 MTU’s to leap frog them site to site. That’s what I did anyways.
---
Our sole purpose is to teach new players how to git gud.
---
??
---
Glad to hear there's room for it, though I'm a bit worried about joining an alliance. The company I work for doesn't even know if it'll need me until the day they need me. I could work 4 hours, 12 hours, and so on. And with Christmas coming closer it'll definitely lean more towards the latter. I'm not sure many people would want me in knowing that, and I don't want to put all I have towards a greater cause only for someone to get tired of it and take me to the cleaners, haha.
---
See above.

Dont worry there are corps where real life comes first like brave collective

We're playing 420d chess in KarmaFleet.
---
I disagree. I'd say Dotlan should follow the exact same restrictions and rules the in-game map does, since it's basically just a version of the in-game map that you can actually read.
---
Wouldn't be opposed to changes to the in-game map, though.
---
Beat me to it

can't argue with that &lt;3

I had bsod issues, using nvidia gtx1060. They stopped after using ddu and then just clean install of just the display driver, not installing the pysx or 3d parts. Running fine on 64bit client too.

No but ok

If you've got the capital to buy a mobile depot and an MTU, you don't need to use an extra ship for salvaging. The MTU will tractor wrecks to it and loot them for you, and you can drop it before you engage the enemy in each pocket. Once they're all dead, head back to the MTU/depot point and replace your guns with salvagers. Usually by the time you're done gearing up enough wrecks will be in range that you don't need to wait for the last few.
---
But if you do it that way, always bookmark the point(s) where you deploy your depot/MTU. If you forget them there and turn in the mission, you'll be able to get back to them with the bookmark. (Ctl-B to bookmark a point, can be done in warp as well if you want to have a "safe point" deadspace area where hostiles have to take the time to scan with combat probes if they want to reach you.) Lastly, keep an eye on Local/D-Scan even in Highsec if you're using an MTU. I've personally had a run-in with a corp called Empty You that specializes in destroying/stealing MTUs and looting them. At least one of their active members drops into active mission pockets with a cloaked ship to scare off wary mission-runners and uses that sane reaction as implicit permission to pop the MTU. Right bastard, that one.
---
Lol.... The booshers just push a button, it's up to the FC if the boosh is on time or not... Just saying, I was surprised how late the boosh was 9/10 you expect to miss when your firing DDs on subcap fleets but you only have to be right once with a few DDs, the pressure is on the FC shoulda stayed and pressured the bait dread some more woulda be fun to see BB fleet tested a bit more instead of the usual hit and run, but living to fight another day probably the right call with no easy targets.
---
Hahaha secret squrriel things
---
Also, always be moving never be stationary, for most of the frigates speed is 2/3 of the tank.

Depending what app you use and how your tokens are protected. I remember seeing phishing link going around Discord recently that took you to a fake discord login page.  Most auth apps are on mobile.  So you get some kind of malware on your mobile device.  Its possible.  If theres a will theres a way.
---
the lance is a titans mega weapon it would have wiped out the whole fleet if they didnt move quick enough, so basically some quick thinking saved them.
---
I would like to see an Avatar or Erebus at the same scale :D
---
If anything that would be Garst's.
---
Join karmafleet. We are recruiting and an amazing defense force to protect u while u shoot rocks with mining lasers

Do u think a vexor fit will work?

Sure, I can print those next. It'll give me a reason to bust out the gold filament.
---
I'm not in Brave but they're a great alliance for new players.
---
And the reason I hate them.
---
ECM is irritating and un-fun to play against as-is.
---
Actually, they emit light, that's why you can see most of them in this picture. So the sky is getting brighter I guess?
---
Let's not because the more people know about a trick the less valuable the benefits it provides, the less isk you get for doing it. Slowly devolving all forms of isk making to just grinding to move forward instead of being ingenious to get ahead.
---
It's available through ESI (which you gave permission for).  The legit question would be which other character are you training if not the one you submitted ESI for.
---
So if what you are saying now is true that 8 died to the lances, then indeed your statement is false since they did hit......
---
If it doesn't seem reasonable to rat without local, move to lowsec and rat there.
---
We've all heard thos exact post 30 fucking times. Leave development to the Dev team.

Do ya love me?
---
But an FPS with the fate of someone's ship on the line sounds like so, so much fun :)
---
No.
---
Admittedly your fleet stood down and allowed over an hour of uncontested offensive entosis as well.  I think Aralis' boys were the only ones active running bombing runs and killing clownshoes.
---

I thought small roaming gangs were in lowsec, and null was where player empires went to war, i guess ccp forgot their own advertising
---
So because something can always be countered by itself, nothing can ever be overpowered. Thats horrible logic.

OHH I made a minmatar character the other day and then abandoned it because I learned you can only train one characters skills at a time

Myrmidon or Dominix is the word you are looking for

Mining is all dependent on how long you are at you computer. Compression is a must, so you'll need access to a station that does this, or have your own. 
---
Semi afk **highsec mining** is excellent safety and generates decent isk, you can get your bearings doing this but you really need your own fleet to do it right. Solo orca or mackinaw are common enough. 
---
**Lowsec mining** is great if you can find an area that's real low population/activity. Good rocks, npcs can be annoying though. 
---
**Null mining** is pretty much botched unless you've got a big group of friends/allies. With local gone, you have no warning to save anything, see excavator losses on the killboard. Panic can save your miners, but only if you've actually got help. 
---
**WH mining** is okay, but your logistic connection out is always generally awful. Better for more established players with others they can count on. 
---
**Moon mining** can happen in all areas of space (WH too I think) but based upon owed taxes it may not be the right thing for you. Highsec moon miners generate null level ore and are a great way to expand your collection targets.
---
Again, how much time you have at your computer and the time of day you play will have a big impact on your mining. You'll make some isk doing it and you can always add PI operations to your income, as well as other activities. 
---
Be warned about immediately joining another group, you need to find your path and not get pulled into something before understanding what's going on. There's no shame in spending a few weeks getting yourself back up to speed to figure out what you really want to do.
---
Did you submit a bug report?

Good luck out there it’s a great game if you stick with it

well as has been made clear, similarly to other people in eve, is that numbers are down (at least in provi as far as i can tell) and we can only pick and choose battles to fight. i wasn't around and i don't know what numbers we had for that., so i can only say the fc and the people online put forth effort in and tried and then didn't feel they had enough to continue at least at that time. 
---
there were fleets up later to do other timers and other things, but its ofc what it is :).

we try our best and that is all i expect.

I agree, but "Captain" is in Pat's name.

I don't care for Pat, I think it should be Garst's.  I miss flying for him.

Sure. And it's a great mechanic in X:Rebirth. Go play that. It's a terrible idea for EVE.

Yeah I don't think the koreans were even expecting to win that fight but rather just wanted the timer to generate the skirmish.

I've done most big active isk making activities. I've run hisec and nullsec incursions, multiboxed DED escalations, machariel smartbombers, boson ratting, super ratting, super plus smartbomber ratting, multi boxed VNIs and domis, and multi boxed rorquals. Multiboxing rorquals was the only one that I feel like the effort and risk was super low compared to the reward. All the others have huge amounts of planning or high enough APMs that only the most masochistic can do them for any length of time.

Let bull sec evolve however it will.  You cant force people to take risks.

They should focus on Low Sex, War Lore and Faction warfare.

The most important tip is to purchase a mining permit for 10 million isk and obey the Code.

Which statement was that?

Well,... seeing that you did not offer facts before and are not here either but instead going on a little can't and derailing the conservation....
---
I never spoke about MY personal wallet other than mentioning the fact that simply raising taxes for traders is not going to resolve the issue.
---
Buy it appears that we do, after all, agree on the fact that something is wrong with mining and the outcome that it gives, be it isk, or isk in form of minerals.
---
So I'll just do what my grandfather told me to remember. Peace of mind comes, by not arguing with fools.....
---
Yes, you are right
