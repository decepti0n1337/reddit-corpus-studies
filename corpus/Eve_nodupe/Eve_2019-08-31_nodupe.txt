&gt; Once the nostalgia of WoW classic wears off, people will start trickling away from it.
---

---
That may be true, but it doesn't mean they will trickle back to eve. The people looking for a a new game to play instead of eve who are going to wow aren't automatically going to come back to eve they left for WoW for a reason and its more than oh look this thing I already did a decade ago that's exactly the same. The people I will be going to join are going back because WoW back then was actually FUN and it got you hooked on it not by being a time sink but because you enjoyed playing. With the recent changes a lot of people in Eve are starting to view it as a job they pay to do and that's not healthy for the long term game population
---
&gt; I also raised this with CCP to see their reponse.  
---
  
---
So you decided to clog the support system with a dumb ticket and *then* ask someone else about this?...
---
We're also in AUTZ and there's often a heap of content in our area.
---
Check out our corp or Black Rise in general. There's a few people looking for good fights, some not (e.g. the usual Garmurs), and some bots/plexing too for when things are quiet.
---
They should still appear on their overview though unless they managed to turn off brackets AND didn't have sleepers in the overview.
---
I really enjoy seeing 70% of null sec celebrate the other 30% not being able to contest them.
---
PVE can be completed in bite-sized chunks. It's PVP that can be a huge time sink as you can spend alot of time forming fleets or hunting viable targets.
---
I don't know. I bid, but didn't win the auction. Does that mean it will always be popping up unless both sides accept the contract? It's pretty annoying.
---
Nice, thanks.
---
OK, thanks.
---
Exactly, how boring. There would have been no content for the hunters, no story for us, and no market demand for a new jump freighter.
---
The hound trying to kill the tethered fleet?
---
Someone is salty
---
Eventually, unlike Kenshin.
---
&gt;...that or you're ten years old and think "gay" is an acceptable insult in this day and age.
---
Yeah, "fagness" is the correct word.
---
Someone was in init till he quit eve
---
Not sure if it plays a role here: it's a long weekend in the US. Monday is Labor Day.
---
Garmurs are tasty.
---
Wow you are so accomplished joining init very impressed.
---
I kind of really like this. Could be really cool
---
Epic meme :fist_bump:
---
Yes, yes, yes!
---
Loved this show.
---
I fail to see what the issue is
---
How many TEST bots have you killed?
---
I know I'm so elite, joining the most independent totally not bullied by goons into taking Sorts coward pact and then defending sort every time he stubbed a toe anywhere between Pure Blind and Tenal.
---
At least T2 Destroyer level resists is a good place to start. And a self rep bonus.
---
Thanks I was expecting just to be told to biomass lol
---
Oh you will, but I liked the idea atleast lmao
---
Maybe I didn't word it correctly.. the launcher window does not appear at all. The process is there but no GUI window. I can't login because of this.
---
possibly, cause the status on those is still "outstanding"

What I'm getting from this is that "my calling" so to speak, would be business school?  Not sure I like that.
---
Probably several hundred
---
If you can't see his sarcasm you have something wrong with you.

so the solution to massive numbers of empty systems is to add even more space...

They need rainbows jets tbh.  Immediate fix to make them worth using.
---
It took them two and a half years to remodel the Domi after finalising and showing off the artwork. Still waiting for the Thrasher remodel. Lost count already.

Why crab in some random ass system when you can make the same amount 1-2 jumps from your home system? It's more of a risk vs reward thing.

Thank you!

goddamn elite pvp right there. gj team op success scared the fuckers good
---
join the bigger blob whoop whoop
---
I really enjoyed it, hope they keep it going.
---
Height or width?
---
Plus Karl Urban is pretty fucking fantastic.
---
I mean they just changed which part of the blob there in tbh. Most of INIT hates it, but they've been getting forced into supporting GOTG for a solid year now. Ironically enough except for saving the GOTG titans, that was just for the tears.
---
Yeah lol
---
Good attitude.
---
They didn't even contest our move OP as far as I csb tell. Maybe the guys under Spartan Vily fought a few but they...
---
Oh wait us? Well see I can't tell you but we fucking covered that keepstar man. And all the tether space. Did I tell you it was all Revenants ? Yeah, and a few Loggerheads for good measure. :)
---
What I took from it is that if you have a good grasp on the organizational aspects of EVE, you'll be quick on the uptake getting an MBA degree.
---
In a good way or bad way?
---
I think turnout was kinda moderated because a lot of senior pilots anticipated the blueballing due to the lack of hostile pings.
---
The technical/production aspects of EVE are as convoluted and headache inducing as they've ever been.  There's a whole lotta math and spreadsheets involved still.  Its the combat game that's been softening its edges to pull in new players.
---
Indeed,that's honestly why I am opposed to removing asset safety. Before a station in null would flip. Without asset safety large blocs would have a field day on structures for a little while stamping out anyone who isn't them.
---
I have a list of probably nearly 100 structures (some are probably gone now) that I cant kill because I'm at work
---
Million! Hundred million! Uhm, crewmemebrs. On the titans. Yeah. \#totallyNotABraveSpai
---
[removed]
---
Man that's amazing. Best game in the world for a reason.
---
Mostly bad, in the sense that an MBA right out of college really isn't that valuable because an MBA is designed to build on a base of knowledge gained from at least some years experience.
---
When I had to decide between programs, it's a big reason I chose the MA I did instead of looking more into an MBA.
---
I doubt it would actively *hurt*. More education is going to be of value to most white-collar careers at least. And if someone was going to pay for it (funded, scholarship, employer, etc.) I would certainly consider it.
---
In short, an MBA isn't the same as most other terminal degrees.
---

Confirmed Trumps Bloodthirst Feynman is a third and a botter. I was his enemy back in Serenity. We outplayed him for a long time. Then he decided to hack in one of our leaders’ computer and managed to steal around 10t isk worth of items. We find him in reality when he was trying to rmt and to sell the stolen items. Then we sued him for using hacking technologies. He was put into jail for around a week and compensated tens of thousands before he was released from jail.
---
So its something that you should look at after having some working experience?
---
Every game multiplayer game I've quit I quit because of the Chinese.
---
I'd agree with you in asking for unfakeable proof, but I trust this obviously unbiased source. There's no way a distinguished pillar of the community such as /u/FratBotsPleaseBan would lie to us. :v
---
Just doing as you are told
---
That still means that some random, but competent, spaceship nerd is just as good as someone with a 4 year degree, Lmao.
---
Radius.
---
If I recall. This has been an issue ever since journal went away since that had "delete" on the auction contracts you had a bid on.
---
I guess you can petition these to be removed.
---
If you're going to do it, yeah, probably. Circumstances matter, but an MBA isn't something I'd look to go into right out of college.
---
Yeah it's just different cause in the past you had to own an Outpost which was a challenge in itself. And getting your assets stuck required a multi day hell camp.
---
Losing all your stuff in a citadel was never an issue until they released citadels.
---
In texas we have guns to shoot back with unlike in san diego.
---
What
---
Well getting an MBA requires you complete the 4 year degree first, so the spaceship nerd would have to get that degree first.
---
big if true
---
&gt;Fraternity? Botting? After Elo's grand crusade against the botting menace to Eve Online? This simply cant be true.
---
no, i am serious, report who is botting to me, i will continually post a reddit post about it daily!
---
Well, in canon the trig ships we have are designs taken from Abyssal Deadspace and modified by the empires to fit capsuleer tech. And IIRC the Amarr were the ones that did that with the Leshak. So it makes some sense.
---
Don't quote me on this, this is secondhand info at best.

Sansha has their own, i might be wrong but i think angels too

Pretty egocentric, i understand.  But childish

If anything sec status needs a change.

Lol troll noob

I just went through this internal monologue: "What? Why would you board an Amarr ship and proceed to laser-gun down the crew? Unless you're really fiercely Amarrian and want to eradicate Minmatars.. but.. oooh! Ooooh.. ah, right..."

Can we do this so hunters have to manually click on targets when uncloaking

and their camera view resets as well

Sure you need 1000 DPS to pause the timer and 5000 to max it.

Yes it has always been the case.  Null is second most populous but there is a country mile in it.   I think everyone has an alt, but there are many many people who never leave highsec since signing up and that is how they enjoy the game.  They don't even know null exists or care.
---
The blue donut gets bigger
---
Sorry for looking for nuance.
---
That is actually a really good idea
---
Diplomats don't deal with their members, they deal with non members. Maybe it isn't the diplo that is the slow one?
---
I kind of had a similar idea.  I’d prefer the gates to null suddenly go dark, To die, and the maps of null to disappear. You can link this directly to the death of the sleepers or some other event. Null alliances would literally be in the dark and have to navigate out of their system through wormholes. These previous null systems would be claimable,  like nullsec and players could link systems through player created stargates that would have to be fueled. We would have a completely dynamic map. There would be no limited access to these player made static gates, anyone can traverse them. 
---
Remove the data that allows players to view activity in systems and we can actually begin to call this Chaos era.

Hahahhahahah

No, I think you actually summed it up perfectly to make my point. Appreciate that

Precisely. He doesn't care for Eve and has said as much before. I don't know who in their right mind chose this lunatic to lead the charge. He has neither the character, credit nor qualifications for the job.
---
Depends on how much you are hauling i guess/how many accounts you have access to. More accounts would mean you could go cheaper.
---
calm down miner
---
I don't know why people downvoted this. The current PvE system is ancient, not engaging at all and encourages botting.

For now we'll go with surprised
---
Can't imagine a good reason to accept them.
---
This is EVE!
---
Yes Karl Urban KILLS it in this.
---
If you are correct, then it had been a month or two since blackout and we've already seen the new bots... Then surely we should see a recovery of concurrent online numbers? Yet it's still slumping. In the last 24 hours the maximum online numbers barely broke 20k which is extremely rare (and lower than the night before which makes no sense --- tonight is Friday night).
---
In fact, the pattern you described should be a big dip at the beginning of blackout then gradual recovery, as bots get rewritten. If bots don't function, they owners won't put them online. What's your explanation now? The rewritten bots are actually even more character intensive than before because they need pods watching the entrance --- and that should instead boost numbers even more. But we didn't observe that in recent data.
---
You are being incredibly arrogant while making arguments easily refutable. If you actually looked at the data and thought of it, you will notice that the data doesn't back you up. Should I understand that for you now?
---
Today you learned about diamond rats, congratulations.
---
According to recent reddit-think, GoTG were already part of the blue donut. Therefore this is an intra-donut move rather than a donut expansion.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
A surprising and... *challenging* intra-donut move, I will grant you.
---
So were we.  We had a good few people waiting around waiting for content delivery
---
But that doesnt mean that botting as a whole has declined. Your "logic" ends after the first step.
---
It doesnt matter because they can use more bots? I mean whats the problem here? They are using alpha bots, it really really doesnt matter if each bot makes less if they can just make more.
---
Dude, Im good. Go bother someone else with your "logic".
---
Players will always choose the easiest and safest method. Taking part of the equation out of the players hands helps push them in the direction you want.
---
Just making resources deplete and then opening wormholes to everywhere isn't going to make anyone do anything different. They'll find a way.
---
Why would doing what they're supposed to do make them a retard?
---
Because the majority of the line members don't like the decision? Lol is that a real question?
---
how
---
about
---
lol
---
You're talking about t2 ships. The t1 are not faction modified by nature.
---
Currently winning, is blackout permanent or something?
---
If you get pointed, you stop warping.
---
my wormhole castle was getting bonked by a group of people in cahoots with a corp i thought was dead that was also in the wormhole. but then they got bonked by another group who dropped on them after contacting me, and they bonked my castle. it was a pretty nice experience, and glad i got see that. i feel bad that i couldnt offer much engagement in battle cuz i cant multibox pvp and didnt really have proper ships for fighting, but maybe next time ill be able to give a good fight. anchoring a new wh, hopefully this time ill have more success and be able to recruit new fellas to help me make content :) thought if it ends up in a nice fight like last time i dont mind
---
I think you're one of the few Init/Imperium posters I haven't habitually shit on, and I feel like we've gotten on fairly well. I'm really interested in what your opinion is on this as a long-time vet of Init. Because, I'll be honest, I legit lost respect for init with this move. Vlade Randal is fucking bonkers, has been since the Morsus Mihi days, and the dude has never actually grown up, just altered his insanity. He's always attracted other shitty miscreants and frankly been a cancer rotting whatever entity he was a part of, activity aside. I understand Init Mercs is intended to weed out the shitty and inactive, and I hope that's the goal here, but I really feel like giving them a shot, real or not, is just not a great look.
---
So if they needed a hundred accounts to make 10 isk an hour it wouldn't matter then, because botters can magically scale infinitely. God you're fucking retarded.
---
Dude, no man. Stop using that argument. I can almost certainly promise you we have more bots in the game than before, they are just in HS and more are needed to offset the isk from NS bots. CCP has said many things many times but the MER is showing much much less activity across all regions and not just bot regions.
---
I agree to a certain point. But the economic argument doesnt hold its own. Its a theoretical concept that hasnt been true in reality for Eve. I am selling stuff at much much higher prices in Jita after the blackout than before. That means we currently have massive inflation. Your isk isnt worth more today, its worth much less.
---
Its not worth taking NS living outside of a few select ships and the isk is far better in other places. And heres the thing about all this risk nonsense. The blackout didnt introduce risk the way you think but it did something else which is why it will never work without massive balance. 
---
Its not a rational change. Do you remember the arguments about introducing mutaplasmids? That it would make the game more chance based and that was bad for a game in which everything can be calculated? Blackout is just a version of that, you dont control when to get tackled anymore, its chance based. Before you had 2 options to stay safe, first was to not get tackled, this was removed. Second was the umbrella, this just got nerfed.
---
So it went from control to the loss of control. It would be irrational if people didnt react to it. 
---
Do you wanna know what happens in NS after this? Its only gonna be the ultrakrabbers that will stay. You get that right? Its the 12 multiboxing Rorqs that just roll a new recon alt, not your average player. So while you think this change has eradicated the people you hate the most from NS the fact is that you just killed of their competition. 
---
The people leaving are not the ultrakrabbers. And concentrating isk is by far the worst thing you can do for an economy, far far worse than having big faucets.
---
You need the launcher launcher.
---
in before dave stark comes bitching about the blackout and killing pve ships who don't fight back.
---
Do YOU even know what you're talking about? You insinuated diplos are retarded for ignoring their own members, bo said they don't deal with their own members as that is not their job. What here is too complicated for you to understand?
---

Big time noob here. What's hunting?

---

---
Diplomats don't do Corp recruitment. There is a completely separate department of the leadership team that handles that. 
---
You're retarded.
---
Right just the "having to support gotg even though they didn't want to" stuff 😂
---
LOL
---
Dude, come on man. Its an immovable object against ships that can fire at the same range as youre jumping in to. Dreads, titans. 
---
Ye cause people most certainly dont already put up more cynos already?
---
Dude, thats not the point. The point is to make super umbrellas weaker, not to make warfare harder or riskier. Why Rise even said that if this change hinders capital warfare they will revise. And the point youre missing here is what you are saying, its more risk. More risk means that FCs will be more careful and that means it will most likely end in less warfare drops.
---
You cant force people to accept changes. If they dont want it it will always backfire. You think this somehow fixes stagnation but if people end up fighting less that means it just caused stagnation. And thats why people are saying its the wrong move.
---
good
---
The main issue here is in order to make these mechanics work in any meaningful sort of way at all either the speed required to out track a turret would have to be high as all hell (elimiting speed tanking from other classes of ships) or the acuraccy penalty would have to be so insane to allow lower higher speed tracking. 
---
Having two independent factors makes it not scale across ship class AT ALL. Cruiser can already have issues tracking frigs unless they are webbed to hell, having webs be an application mod is completely fine.
---
In large scale fights you are right that frigates become irrelevant damage sources, but I'd argue there is no issue there. Frigates have huge advantages in mobility both on grid and between grids when compared to larger ships making them very worthwhile in smaller fights. 
---
In the system you propose it essentially becomes clear all ships of your class or higher, side with the lowest size class remaining can't realistically be threatened. There exist significant draw backs to up shipping as is and frigates are far from useless and unpopular.
---
Isnt a call made by diplos. You'd have to shit on the entire leadership team. Since they're been supporting GoTG for approx a year now. That's a long term decision. The diplomat is the guy who announces the leaders and introduces them to each other. Then makes sure they take all the notes for the meeting. Then they enforce the agreement. 
---
I'm sure final call landed on Sister Bliss' lap. So in reality. You're bitching about Sister Bliss and not the diplos. 
---
Honestly. You're retarded.
---
I'm fully okay with shitting on the entire leadership team.
---
Then by all means. Kick and scream like a bitch to your hearts content.

Not really, look on casual day on zkill. There are more kills in HS than in NS+LS :) only when bigger battles occurs NS wins with numbers. Im trying to do some funny tables later this week to show some correlations in eve. peace. o/
---
Yes. But it requires CCP and god emperor hilmar taking some responsibility for his bad ideas and to be willing to break a few eggs along the way.
---
The simple truth is that the direction they took in 2015/16 (ish) was fundamentally flawed and resulted in some incredible, unbelievably shit game mechanics, and although it brought in a mass number of short term "minecraft peaceful mode" players, it did so at the expense of the core playerbase up to that point. CCP is unwilling to admit their faults, a flaw they have always had, which has resulted in years of the game languishing in agony while CCP attempts to convince the playerbase everything is actually fine, which has basically made them appear completely incompetent and totally out of touch with reality and made a large portion of the playerbase openly hostile towards them.
---
The hard fact is that Eve was at it's healthiest with a large number of "medium sized" groups with their own individual identities competing or cooperating with one another. Eve is dying has been the common meme basically since day 1, true, but it moreso meant "the way I play eve is getting nerfed" when people said it. However, the current supercapital umbrella 100 keepstar fortress region meta will 100% unironic and with absolutely certainty result in the doors closing on eve. We are really starting to see an exodus of the pvp oriented side of the playerbase, who have given up waiting for rebalances, starting with the departure of a lot of the top AT focused players, of Skill Urself earlier this year, and claiming a growing number smaller corps and individuals daily.
---
The veteran playerbase is getting old, sure, and they don't have as much time to dedicate to eve anymore. But that's not why they're (we're) quitting. They're quitting because in this stage, the game is no longer worth playing for them. So many will stick around reddit or keep up with changes despite having been logged off for years, honestly, does that sound like a person with no free time, or a person who wants their hobby to be fun again to you?

Its an old chart. The numbers from what I gather are like 40% or so. Dunno if its true but I think those numbers came from CCP originally.

But honestly, HS has tons of bots in it, always had. And all of alts. But I would still say the majority of people that live there are real players who just dont care about the rest.

There is no one size fits all fit, trying to be a jack of all trades is generally worse than just being good at what a fit is good at. I don't sweat it generally. There are lots of things a mega tank T3 can't deal with while also being much easier to bait.

A random idea for discussion regarding blackout:
---
What if there were some random systems in nullsec picked to have delayed/regular local, with non-unlimited anomaly respawning?  This could provide something to fight over, and provide a place for (some) relatively safe PVE for newbies.
---
Munin.
---
Yep, with 8 launchers...
---
Its more on the stupid amount rorqs rrep tbh than the tankyness of the skiff
---
why crab in some random ass system to begin with?
---
If solo or small gang stealth bomber or cloaky t3.
---
If fleet muninn
---
There's no way a Hulk or Mackinaw would have had enough EHP to survive between rep cycles against five t3 cruisers, though.
---
I wish we were all saying goodbye to your posting :(
---
And which t3?
---
you must be new if you think I'm triggered
---
They are also most certainly botters lmao

Funny part is, CCP fucked themselves with the timing.  Doing their Era of Hilmtardation changes right as WoW classic releases gives players something to move on to.  Sure, it may only be for 6 months, but breaking the EVE login routine is the hardest part, and these changes + a fun game to play in the mean time is a WONDERFUL way to do that.  If CCP stays its current course, by the time WoW burnout sets in, the game will be even less attractive for people to come back to, and its much easier to uninstall when you haven't played in months anyway.
---
Make them the slower aligning but beefier nullified interceptors.

I just started back a few weeks ago. Some cool new things like the mobile tractor beam cans that collect loot for you.  Pos's are not needed anymore as player is Ed bases are cheap now.  You no longer need to worry if so done will 'borrow' your ship.    There is now no  one instantly noticable in local in 0.0.  like wormholes are.  Lots of new ships and the new invasion think is pretty fun.   Try the free version if you want to check it out but you will likely need to subscribe if you want to actually do anything.
---
Looking to get into EVE and I watched a lot of Videos and read up on it...and it seems like a lot...are there any training academies for it or anything to read and have on a second screen while learning the ropes?
---
I guess Tengu?

Lost 6 of them in a month.

Oh no wait, nvm. It is MinerDistraction, he's just bad.

---
Since I've been back (only like a month now) I've refit my legion like 3 times. I'd say I enjoy the struggle with that ship. 
---
According to zkill I like the devoter more but that was just due to some weird situation involving a multi-boxing miner with like 22 accounts. I actually don't really like being in devoters.
---
The worst part is, it should have been obvious to anyone with basic reasoning skills how the Blackout would turn out.  The fact that so many people raved on it and Hilmtard actually thought it would fix the game is incredibly shocking.
---
Sorry to hear that bud.
---
Ty, very helpful. I have plenty of tank so I think I’ll be ok
---
[the alpha’s guide] (https://www.thealphasguide.com/) and [eve University](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)are good places to start, and there are plenty of playthroughs you can find on YouTube
---
Loki
---
All playstyles contribute to each other in some way, I’m not big on the cutthroatness either, scamming and high-sec piracy are off limits from corp policy, we do whatever everywhere else, I just really love working with people closely, while having a plan to screw them over if they do it first.
---
My brother and I just returned to the game after about a year break. It's been just great so far. I don't envy you having to figure out all the changes since 2009 but since you have a friend/brother with you just dive back in and enjoy the adventure. I bet most eve players will agree some of their best stories came from when they were a bit clueless, so maybe you can capture some of that during your triumphant return.
---
There's probably some impact from WOW but there are other variables in play here. There has been a month of skillpoints from the skilling spree event then the login for free skillpoints over the previous weekend. The release of WOW classic was also the day these events finished up. The dropoff on concurrent logins likely includes the true impact of the blackout as the previous figures were skewed by everyone logging in for free skillpoints.

low effort on all sides, of course Eve is becoming more and more a low effort game, the slow and steady death spiral has stated ladies and gentlemen.  Its better for the bottom line for players to pay for ships with plex then with in game means.  They will be less players over all but more of them will be using their wallets and not out in the fields.  Of course this is great for hunters, at first but the end result not so much.

Awesome, what is that place?

Firework launchers
---
Sabre, Bifrost, Thrasher ...in that order
---
This THING will attract CONCORD attention for sure...
---
The era of chaos is different but not difficult to learn the tricks to play in this new land. Pve wise is meh as you adapt to no local with an exchange of excavatiors for t2 mining drones. With cyno changes most peoples like me will have a tankie recon sitting on a tac to either warp down or light at range.
---
PvP wise most of the meta for the solo hunter is a t3c, bombers and kiteing ships. I find chaos era to be boring on nearly all fronts.
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
Because there’s no reason to hide them. I’ve never had so many modules cluttering my screen that I felt the need to get rid of them.
---
A smart company would of synched skilling spree with WOW's (re)release.
---
The overlap between combat ceptors and assault frigates mean that they are more or less in constant conflict. So I would focus on buffs to combat ceptors soft stats to try to give them a unique identity
---
Change the mwd sig reduction on the interceptors skill to 20%/lvl from 15% (meaning 100% at lvl 5, so no sig bloom from mwds at all)
---
Modest buffs to their base agility
---
Minor buffs to their base speed
---
Possibly some sort of universal tracking role bonus of 10-15% so they can apply easier while moving at high speeds
---
If I were to go even further I would have changed the mwd bonus of afs to something more in tune to their roles, just to make ceptors somewhat more unique
---
Would make it so combat ceptors still aren't as strong in a straight fight as assault frigates, nor should they be, but they are incredibly fast and evasive. Giving them dscan immunity would be pretty handy as just a utility thing but I ultimately don't think it's needed.
---
This another side affect of the Era of Hilmtardation changes that I'm sure CCP didn't even think about; if EVE survives this shitfest, players are going to be MUCH less likely to sub in 6 month-1 year blocks because CCP has lost trust.   MMO devs much prefer to have people locked in to  long subs.

Ohh...
---
I see more covetors than hulks. Cheaper to replace if your bot loses a few in a row.
---
Because a carrier or haw dread costs just as much, and is more versatile for the money.
---
mmh true but if they dont really care about cost hulks are gonna be more likely then any thing with tank. its not like a bots gonna try a fight off people.

And some tryhard campers who will flee from everything they can't instakill.

I could use some more luck. Luck is not something that happens to me often.

Not good, going pay to win.
---
If you like the game and haven't played since 2010, you should get back at least to see what's new, there've been tons of good new content both pvp and pve. Now is probably the best time because of blackout and all the chaos era stuff going on.

Srry but no, space photos are colored based on wave lenght.

T1 abyssal guide:
---
Does your frigate/cruiser have guns and ammo - good!
---
Bro there is WH if u want to lose all assets. GTFO from nullsec ok? Nullsec stations were always safe.
---
Munin or Ferox. The competition is very close, but those are the top ones.
---
New PVP content? Where?
---
Because Null has concord gates, where npc's grab all your shit and evacutate from the station thats about to blow up, wormholes don't have this static concord owned gate.
---
Very niche and rare compared to the big picture, driven by large null blocks
---
Muh krabbing. Hilmar man bad.
---
they need to cut off all in and out of game intel like this while blackout persists, otherwise its totally one sided, the second you start to rat or mine people can see where you are and know exactly where to go to get you.
---
Yes! Compare a god forgotten 3rd world country with your "world first" Murrica, brings a tear to my eye... also get more guns, like a lot more, the problem will solve itself eventually...
---
Thank you.
---
I think it lost prio, just as the tiericide did. Unfortunaly.
---
Weirdly enough it feels quite like that pre-bitting era. Less online numbers, but mostly humans and active players.
---
Nullsec carebears are crying their shit out over CCP trying to make the game more dangerious and break the stagnation that was choking the game for 2 years now. Economy was out of control and now CCP try to stop the ISK faucets like afk ratting or capitals printing when rorquals pump ridiculous amounts of ores.
---
Hands out new glasses :)
---
&gt;Dude, come on man. Its an immovable object against ships that can fire at the same range as youre jumping in to. Dreads, titans.
---
Yes because my titans and dreads will surely lock up that sweet force recon in no time right? And if we´re speaking about tidi, they´ll surely lock it up even faster! Bad argument. 
---
&gt;The point is to make super umbrellas weaker
---
Sweet! Doesnt sound like a bad thing. Do you think its a good think if any roaming gang even gets close to esoteria/delve/TKE that they will immediately be dropped by titans and supers? 
---
&gt;You think this somehow fixes stagnation but if people end up fighting less that means it just caused stagnation.
---
Except thats just not true, lopsided supercapital drops DO NOT create more content and future fights. There is a reason why no one goes to the fortress regions anymore.
---
i heard that it's really working out for all of you, better get more guns so the problem solves itself...
---
Join a proper PvP corp that lives in lowsec, nullsec or wormhole space that is newbro friendly and have the mechanisms to train you.
---
There is no other way to learn PvP in this game and it will be fun, I promise.
---
For null, you can try: Eve Uni, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet, Dreddit etc.

Barkness dying. Noone cares.
---
What's interesting is Init accepting those bads.
---
True, hut at least the bits do not cry over Reddit when CCP turns off their free, afk isk faucet.
---
When i first started playing eve i also expected the stuff inside the nullsec stations (back when they were just normal stations) to be lost if your alliance lost control of said stations, my expectation was based on what usually happens in history when a city is conquered by a foreign army. But unfortunately i soon learned the somewhat soft reality of eve online that the conquering army that takes hold of the station will actually leave the stuff of their enemies completely untouched after the conquest, how nice of them.
---
Happened to me a while back on my sentinel during a zarvox fleet.
---
Was on my sentinel and activated my TD the same tick the target died, didnt think much about it but a few systems later it was still spinning.
---
Eventually i was friendly enough to help a fellow fleetmate who burned out his prop mod (had spare depot and 5mn in cargo). So i offered to switch ship so he can launch the depot. After ejecting we both got the same message with timer counting up  [https://i.imgur.com/53pvE1c.png](https://i.imgur.com/53pvE1c.png) which made us unable to board it...
---
tried a few things myself then wrote a ticket which was answered within a few minutes. He first ported myself back to jita (would be like 50 or so jumps in a 200m pod -.--) and after a bit of talking also the modules, rigs and the sentinel itself (about another 200m). So considering that was one of the few tickets i wrote i am quite satisfied with the customer support.
---
So my guess is this bug has something to do with:
---
\- yeah you activated the module, start cycle
---
\- wait target is dead module was never activated
---
\- module continue cycling
---
\- no need to stop the cycle as the module wasn't active...
---
All three upright chinese players.  Those three are the ones that haven't saved up to buy the bot yet.
---
4 people... Fc..
---
I guess if that's what floats your boat
---
They get banned but there is absolutely nothing stopping them from having replacements already trained up.  I mean fuck, they figure out how many accounts they can keep running on their current hardware and just make sure to prep 3x extra accounts.
---
Ah magical teleportation police, logic is best.

&gt;&lt;the_mittani\&gt; yo so after all the recent… instability in relations, Iron Armada has decided to stop being chewed on by Dark Shines and is widotting into GSF as a corp  
---
LMAO Iron Armada is a strong independ alliance who don't need no goons amirite? u/Tridgit
---
Because historically, wormholes only ever had POS towers and POS towers could always be destroyed within a couple of days, and their contents dropped.
---
Nullsec was not the same, once a station was built it was permanent, and although you might lose direct access to it when a new alliance captured the station, your items would still be there, and you could negotiate for access, could infiltrate the new alliance to extract your stuff, or you could fire-sale it on the cheap to the new owners and recoup a large part of your money.
---
The question of WHY asset safety exists as a thing at all is quite simple, it's to try and maintain an EVE vs Life balance. 
---
A person who goes on holiday for a week, deployed on an active tour in the military etc should not be required to spend the proceeding weeks shipping all their stuff out just-in-case, and those that are out-of-game without foresight due to things such as illness, work commitments etc, should not come back and be forced to discover they lost everything they had, simply because EVE couldn't be their priority.
---
Why not just tell them to HTFU? Pure pragmatism, they would likely just not bother coming back, and would quit the game, and that's bad for everyone.
---
"Independent Sov Holding Alliance"
---
\&gt;As a returning player, i would expect that a destroyed cita means that the stuff stored there will be dropped.
---
It should like that everywhere be but CCP wanted players to use the Upwell structures and likely went way too far making them cheap and safe. So now we have to deal with the burden of incredibly safe, and unrewarding to shoot structures littering New Eden, and the amount of tears and wailing to put them back into balance to support robust conflict will be massive.
---
CCP made the mistake of thinking they could always tweak down the safety easily, and while they can, but it isn't going to be easy. But perhaps in the Age of Chaos, we might actually see them try.

Flying for the Minmitar in FW, wanted to do the SoE arc to gain some standing and pull better missions.  One of the missions has you "scout out the drone hive" and "report on friendly vessels".  Caldari navy ships appeared blue to me on my overview, yet they still made me boom :(  Is the epic arc unfinishable if you are in  FW but for only two races?  Would prefer not to drop my corp to finish the #1 main game starter PvE activity arc, just because the corp im in are engaged in the #1 main game starter PvP content.

Is there a guide to ganking targets (especially frigates) warping into a station? I understand that Tornados are best, and I've made a fit with Pyfa that locks frigates under 2 seconds, and used the damage graph to determine the optimal distance to gank. Is it a matter of smashing "lock" as they land and hoping for the best?

What I got from that ad is that Pearl Assbyss's marketing campaign is now "lets get young girls addicted to MMOs, too, because our cash shop numbers show they aren't exploited enough yet".
---
More cap kids whining about how their ships can actually be destroyed *cry some more*
---
At first I thought this was a video to introduce PA's new PR manager, who just happened to be called Megan Fox, but that wouldn't have been nearly embarrassing enough would it?
---
Now there are bots watching the gate that report back.
---
The problem with eve....
---
Returning players?  2019 is the year that mass players are leaving, not returning.
---
Generally people use an 80m isk\~ tornado and scan the cargo of the ship, while having another character on grid to loot the cargo. This is pretty common in Jita
---
We were supposed to have the serpents carrier and serpents support fighters. Can't even remember the names nor bonuses. 😭😋
---
The REEE in this sub hasn't died down though so it's clearly not as effective.
---
Osprey. When your fleet has no idea what a cap chain is. I'm sure there is a meme somewhere.
---
Good meme well played
---
Numbers are dropping pretty quickly. Good news is you guys dont have to pay right away, you can come back and play as alphas and see if you like it still or not.

Actually yes.

---
Yeah as long as the gates operate on an acl list since they are being fueled by alliance.
---
Cuz after half a decade of total safety, there is actually since risk in null now. Let me tell you how crushed I am. I could cry.
---
Just biomass. It's over. You had too much drink
---
Lel kek rip
---
Your expecting ns krabbers to come to an actual fight. Expecting to much? Yeah.
---
Wait, I thought hunters cry when they can't tackle ratter?   
---
Let me guess, now they cry: "I tackled Domi on Haven, but he had neuts and killed my Loki! Fu\*\*\*ing bot!"
---
And now you can sell him another one!
---
Wormholes were going to get asset safety but the WH community told CCP they didn't want it and they listened.
---
They would probably canablize themselves afterwards
---
&gt; I think that it's so unfair that I can't log in anymore and enjoy a good movie on Netflix while I print my ISK

lol you almost had me until that part

I prefer Bee Armada

Or with other words: More for n+1
---
ANd I thought INIT is a pvp alliance?
---
Lots of changes both coming up and already in. With the basic ideolgy that "nullsec has become safer than jita and your 13 boys are making a billion isk an hour".     
---
Just forget the reddit bullshit, find a small friendly Corp, and enjoy the game. There is tons of stuff to do even if you hang in a high sec Corp right now.
---
Oh they did too look at that. Those are some blingy Skiffs.
---
What exactly is wrong that would keep someone from omega? It's a game. You log in, hop in discord, do stuff together. Except what you do is a bit more complicated than WoW .
---
And a cyno?  ;D
---
If you are derping around playing casually with trade and industry, nothing changed. But if you have ambitions for hi leve sandboxl play, it will take you many months then you will realize what ccp is doing to the game and quit.
---
It’s a lot of fun when you just log in and play.
---
Read some posts. A lot have come back because they actually like the changes.
---
Cruise missile stealth bombers. I would roam low sec as part of the Caldari faction, and I would target tackling frigates from 200km with a passive targetter, launch 6 missiles, a piece, cloak up and either gtfo or go again.
---
This.
---
Could we go above 999? k thx CCP.
---
Asset safety is on its way out. You right but things be getting fixed.
---
Why waste money if u only want to check game? hmm?
---
See the diamond in the rats name? There's your answer. Nasty fuckers, but totally intended. Those diamond NPCs actually have competent AI.
---
Dont forget their members have to pay init every month.
---
But really they arent renters!
---
&gt; The main issue here is in order to make these mechanics work in any meaningful sort of way at all either the speed required to out track a turret would have to be high as all hell (elimiting speed tanking from other classes of ships) or the acuraccy penalty would have to be so insane to allow lower higher speed tracking.
---
That's partly correct. You either have to rely on MWD to be at close-midrange and outtrack cruiser guns by maintaining high enough angular velocity or have to reduce your signature by all means possible (including not using mwd) to reduce incoming damage if you cannot outtrack anything. If you are in cruiser - you cannot reduce your signature low enough at midrange, but you can try a) be at greater range so that some shots will miss b) try to get closer which should work fairly well vs long-range guns which are supposed to have quite bad tracking
---
Yes cruisers in some conditions have issues with tracking frigates, but in some they do not. E.g. try to use any frigate (even sig-bonused, let alone t1) against muninns, you will quickly find yourself in a pod even if they are not assisted by webs/tps, but are just spread around a little. The only realistic way to tank cruisers in high enough numbers is range tank. Sure if cruiser is alone you have more options.
---
As for making frigates overpowered - I made it clear in initial post, that bigger ships need something to compensate, like reduced frigate's ability to affect bigger ships. Check its last paragraph.
---
&gt; EDIT: In both cases you have targets that had to have near 0 transversal to die. A beam oracle CANNOT track those frigates unless they are not moving
---
This is not entirely true:
---
1) There are other threats besides my oracle on grid so they can hardly move in the most optimal way
---
2) They have to burn in at sharper degree to have even slightest chance of catching me
---
3) I am using radio + std frentix/drop, not aurora
---
4) I transversal match against target I am shooting (mwd + 2 sebos in mid), without it I'd not hit most of these frigs, or say [this 10mn kiki](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77301526/) - it had no webs on it, just LR points and scrams as i was shooting it from 40k away with xray pulses

Fuck those lokis tbh, most broken ship in the game

Hurr durr. Delete Asset Safety. &lt;/s&gt;

^(Sarcasm aside, you wrote a fantastic summary.)

While i love card games also, you forgot the new card:

Electronic Warfare
---
6 mana 1/1
---
Has Taunt
---
Battlecry: is useles for the rest of the game
---
Still used in troll decks tho.
---
Why would CCP or anyone think about buffing a super (Any super) at this point in the game?&gt;
---
Others hold the same view as you. They have hinted that they will be removing asset safety and this will give people a reason to work through the timer mechanics.
---
Looks like a Raven to me
---
Yeah my point exactly. Those 30k where simulated bots and some few players, i saw it too. Further even if it was 30k players it means nothing if they are not really doing anything, or building anything, it means literally nothing, such tech is decade old already. You have "access" to a dream, reality is different. By all means i have no problems with him scamming you out of your money, in fact i think he should. Fools like you that invest emotionally into scams like that will never see what is right in front, and i have no problems with it, it just continues to amaze me how one can literally fund a hobby by fooling idiots, and when one attempts to actually inform these people of their stupidity in order to help them they come back at him with "arguments" that have little to do with reality. There is nothing like a man invested in a dream. By far the biggest fool you will ever meet. Keep funding someone elses hobby mate, have fun with that.
---
Yes, Eve is a balance. Allowing PVE players a completely accurate and risk-removing knowledge of when someone potentially hostile is in their system is terrible balance.
---
And if you are going to sit docked up crying into your keyboard because you might actually have some risk in printing online space money, rather than actually *playing the game*, maybe the problem is with you and with becoming accustomed to the former terrible balance.
---
'cos when putting all supers on same line they can be nerfed at the same time or their roles can be changed. :p
---
If asset safety had never existed it would have been the norm to have to move stuff or lose stuff if you were unable to play for whatever reason. People mention vets often when they argue the reason to keep asset safety but the percentage of null players in the army is relatively small compared to the number of active players in null. 
---
If you are ill that would be a shame but the game should not cater again to the minority who fall so ill they suddenly can’t play.
---
People need a reason to destroy structures. Asset safety removal would be that reason
---
Yes, that's what I mean.
---
Capital projection is a problem, so is turtling.
---
And these are being cleared up
---
Don't be silly, they both obviously copied World of Warcraft.
---
Top elite pvp blob.
---
And that is how you turn a hardcore full-loot game where actions have consequences into another casual piece of shit.
---
How is a jump dictor wyvern? Word on the street is that supers make better heavy tackle ships than dps ships of the line. Id thought the wyv would be pretty good at that. 
---
If they go capdry so easy maybe the new cap implants might be better. I think they will be a really great implant set for the right ships in the right situation.
---
Guarantee that's the fucker with the MTU I kept trying to shoot in highsec XD
---
Well there is a thing called a drifter roaming fleet. The basically go around systems killing any and all afk botting. It was not taken well by the community and so was switched off.
---
Super on grid negates all nullification.

Titan on grid disables all cloaking devices.

}:&gt; /s
---
Thanks again Init. for the save by the way. Much appreciated.
---
Don't read too much into it the horde and boat tears were amazing.
---
Strat or the Hecate these days.
---
They do downvote though.
---
Eve is in a great place and heading in the right direction. Get back involved it’s a good ride
---
Yeah, I didn't think it was anything to do with me. Still appreciated it though. Also saw the tears later and it was pretty funny.
---
It's like you haven't heard they're gonna delete all subcaps cause chaos era
---
&gt; I too wonder why did they agree to be part of the largest blob, taking 2/3rds of the map. Instead of having some independance and more targets to shoot. They were fin, when they were harrassing out if Syndicate.
---
Up to a point. They didn't make the easiest of direct neighbours, but it's been 2 years since Panfam rolled up in force and started tearing down their infrastructure in Syndi. 
---
I can't recall off the top of my head if Init joining the Imperium was official after that (they were being assisted by goons during the fortizar bashes iirc, I still remember the soul-crushing Tidi) but it was the logical thing for them to do at the time.
---
Nah you aren't allowed to complain about broken subcaps, you're only allowed to cry about caps.
---
Yeah but idiots will call everything they don't like a bot.
---
People not ratting in subcaps 
---
&gt;They're just bots not undocking to feed me kills
---
People unsubbing
---
&gt;They're just bots who cares about the player count drop
---
People who can't be fucked to spam D-scan for the entire time of the hour or so per day they actually have free
---
&gt;Must be bots else they'd find getting RSI fun
---
Hey everyone, if you need a friend, I am your friend, trade me your ships
---
I had someone call me a bot because i baited in a fw plex and said gf in loacal straight after
---
Everytime people post a kill they claim it was a bot
---
Paranoia is real yo
---
Stay out of catch then m8
---
13% of drone boats commit 52% of botting offences.
---
Since cap is the main problem, why not make the active shield resists (or at least the capital ones) work like assault damage controls i.e. when it's not active, it'll only give 20-30% of the typical resist it does?
---
From a lore perspective, there is a NPC hauling service (Interbus) that handles hauling goods between stations. They are responsible for asset-safety transportation in all areas of k-space. They adhere to a strict code of secrecy, allowing pirate factions to use their services as well, which means they are generally able to operate without problem in null. - However they do not operate in j-space. That wasn't part of their intended purpose.
---
Obviously there are some glaring holes in that narrative from a practical perspective. Like how they are able to transport Titans that end up in asset-safety. These dudes must operate some next-level jump freighters.
---
Sure. They combined the functionality of Outposts and POSes and went with the safest of the two paradigms. That's fine, but it cost Eve the content driver of fighting over POS positioning and loot drops. 
---
They \*should\* have from the beginning replicated that, with larger Upwell classes having more asset safety, and the spammable smallest ones perhaps none at all. But that was more work, and pandering to the safebears was in vogue at CCP at the time, so we got ultra-cheap and ultra-safe structures we have today. Actually, when they first came out, they we even more safe than they are today if you can believe that, with a standard Astrahus being immune to any attack at all like 95% of the time.  
---
POSes were never safe, so I don't know why you are citing the outpost situation as a reason to make all Upwell structures have asset safety.
---
Golem will do cable chest fly anytime now
---
No!
---
Stop saying mean things to me. I'll play as a risk averse, cloaked coward if I want and you can't stop me.
---
Lol well why don’t you take that stuff to rakapas and see what happens I’m sure there a gf there.
---
That's because bots are designed with optimal isk making in mind. Why wouldn't a player who's objective is to make isk follow those same behaviours?
---
Man, you must be new here. POSes regularly dropped many-fold that, and more interestingly you got to directly  take the stuff of the other players, almost like a lottery.
---
I appreciate your piratical sentiments there friend, but aim higher! Asset safety has a place, but it has swung too far to the side of safe. This is suppose to be a full-loot PvP game, and it is about time CCP took a shot at building back in some of that gameplay they took out.
---
how about blob needs more people
---
How is tracking
---
ADCs on supers. Dear god.
---
jesus christ
---
I've been called a bot because I was fleet warping two of my alts with me in travel ceptors.
---
Some people are just plain stupid.
---
nope. been to plenty of other countries that don't have a school shooting on a daily basis or 52 murders a day though...
---
You don't say...
---
Hold on to your hat, m8... We haven't even had that deep conversation about t2 capitals XD
---
nice
---
It takes some work. You won't be taking down frigates that orbit around you. The idea is you maintain range with the web and match transversal. Once you can apply, things get volleyed off the grid real fast. You can de-bling it by a lot just by converting the web/point to Caldari Navy and the gyros to T2s.
---
Probably doctrine
---
&gt; and pry it from my cold dead hands
---
ok NRA boy
---
The problem has always been its all about the fax numbers. You dont need shield resist bonus if you dont drop supers without fax on standby. Thus the damage bonus is more valuable in these situations.
---
muninn for fleet stuff
---
loki for solo pimp
---
stratios for solo semi-pimp
---
Is there anyone who doesn't have an alt which can join Horde's standing fleet?
---
And a pos still drops it. The only thing is you need a dozen dreads to do it efficiently. I can solo kill and loot citadels and keep everything for myself. Citadels also drop things in Corp hangers, things in production outputs etc. 
---
I have no desire to loot someone's entire Eve career, I'm quite ok with it going to asset safety, especially if they are afk from the game, because when they come back I would rather them have a reason to continue playing eve instead of having the strongest reason possible to walk away for good.
---
Also please tell me who ever said this is a full loot pvp game? I don't remember ever reading it on the website anywhere. It seems like one of those things if you repeat it long enough, you believe it.
---
Do you also offer ship doubling services? I have an AT ship I need 2 of. 😏
---
People still fly Wyverns. I don't think that all ships should see perfectly evenly distributed usage.
---
Yep pretty much.
---
KINSHIT ??? Lol
---
Villore Accords is an alliance. I've seen more than one corp in it. Are you talking about Last Rites, the corp that I've encountered most?
---
Another hand in the air, rejoined a few weeks ago now I'm losing ships in lowsec getting my bearings and isk flow started again.  Having a blast!
---
Because their mindset is botlike
---
*gaypwnd*
---
No Reason to undock im 2019
---
Heh.. Reminds me of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/48szwr/drone_sass/).
---
Yeah, you have to put in a ticket or it will never go away. Super broken. I just turned off contract notifications bc of it :(
---
Init was in Imperium before Horde started pressuring them. A few months later MC and NC evicted them from Fountain, but at this point they were long standing Imperium member.
---
Sadly there are some very poor noobs here would rather take out someone's eve career so they can loot some free isk. Ghetto class.
---
traitors to who?
---
Well I'm not thrilled by the news, to be sure.
---
On the other hand I have immense respect for Bliss, and I'm 100% confident that he won't tolerate any stupid bullshit.  I'm also pretty sure that he's had that discussion with Kenshin leadership.
---
So either Vlade &amp; co toe the line and act all *reformed* (excellent outcome) or they don't and reap immediate consequences (I am ok with this outcome too).
---
It has a nice ring to it
---
I do!
---
so no, thanks for your input then.
---
Didn't they already make their call for the day?
---
ugh........cannot belive
---
&gt; one of the few tickets i wrote i am quite satisfied with the customer support.
---
occasionally you read bad stuff on r/eve/ but CCP's customer support is one of the best I've personally encountered in many years of gaming.
---
I am still very new to the game and it’s mechanics. What is an Acl list?
---
My favorite ship. It's too bad I've yet to find a use for it in null :&lt;
---
maybe if the other half of EVE didn't start a war null would be a much interesting place
---
My favorite ship. It's too bad I've yet to find a use for it in null.
---
Correction QLPX-J in Detorid is TEST sov.
---
[deleted]
---
...or pay a hauling service to move it for you?         
---
EDIT: You know what? FUCK mobile internet.
---
Not really. You need range to be able to hit something that's moving fast like a mach. Catalysts and brutix' are the go-to for their dps, but catalysts have such terrible range that even if they landed and scrammed+webbed the mach it'd just float out of weapon range.
---
For a target like a mach, there just isn't a cheap way to gank.
---
 If this is real, i will throw my money at it. Best space rts ever!
---
Friendship is the best ship after all, the antisocial billy no mates up north would do well to learn this.

---
&gt;It's bots
---
&gt;We don't need these players.
---
&gt;They're probably krabs we don't want em 
---
&gt;It's ok this is normal
---
&gt; HTFU/some other stupid remark.
---
There are fewer players than I've ever seen, both due to CCP's actions and Warcraft classic.
---
Ye that is a good point that i didn't consider. If you have bucketloads of accounts you could use arty thrashers, but it'd be a pain in the ass to get the required alpha, so not very realistic.
---
holly shit, this is amazing, I hope its an actual secual and not some shitty phone game or gimmick, that stuff about FIG or whoever they are have me worried its not a standard game
---
If the only kills you can get is defenseless targets well...
---
Literally who cares? Who are we betraying? Where did Tridgit touch you?
---
A few iron members
---
So did we, the fountain curse is real
---
&gt;	If I were to get wishes, I wish for the existence that Bliss envisaged for us when we moved to Immensea, which was as an independent alliance which would have plenty of respect and no permanent blues.
---
Ya know, there’s some guys up  in tribute doing exactly that. Having a blast too. If you ever want to come check it out. Just let me know. &lt;3
---
Exactly
---
Anyone could have told you that when you park your alliance behind 2 to 3 members of blues, your members are gunna get bored and burn out.
---
All these guys do is login to moon mine so no real change.
---
Do exploration while you're waiting for your industry jobs to finish.
---
It wasn't always that way
---
As if that isn't how most small business owners think. "If I do this job myself it doesn't cost anything!"
---
Our nose is bleeding from where we bumped into our shiny new keepstar in Detorid.
---
Show me on dotlan where the blue doughnut touched you
---
What the fuck is that...
---
Actually I'd love to see some celebrity try to sell EVE Online as a form of meditation.
---
There are humans, there are bots, and there's a third category called bot-aspirant, which is a human pilot who is effectively indistinguishable from a bot. Only humans are allowed.
---
Whatever side of the conflict, hope you enjoy the jab.
---
Back in the day they had pride and didn't call for mittani backup in every op. Easy way is easier though.
---
Edit: Downvote all you want but deep inside you know it is true. This is the risk aversion that's killing the game.
---
The reason for asset Saftey in HiSec is freeports. 
---
CCP wanted players to be able to build freeports, set taxes, someone who invested in Rigs might end up with a really popular spot for people to hang out. If there wasn't asset Saftey everyone would just keep using stations for everything because you couldn't trust anyone to protect your shit.
---
I want to have a dreadnaught in my C2 for fun. Will building a fortizar/dread actively bring people into my hole to evict me?  I know several astras would make eviction less likely bit I really want the dread lol
---
Yes, back then there was not enough blues to park behind.
---
When we moved to fountain we had no blues
---
No. Way. Hell. Yes!!!!!@
---
Nice!
---
Care to link some kills and evidence that they were bots?
---
Imagine being in snuff lmao
---
What about the people that do industry to fund their wallet? Or exploration? Do you count that as krabbing?
---
I’m honestly surprised it took this long.
---
Any bot or botlike behaviour is not ok for so say the lord James
---
look we've got some pretty low standards, but we still have SOME
---
Full loot? That is self-evident. The rule set provides for PvP and loot drops everywhere, numerous devs have been repeatedly confirmed this is intended, and even the gameplay video currently on the main Eve Online page talks about piracy as a player activity.
---
Yes, that doesn't mean all player stations have to be full loot drop or anything nor I have I claimed such. But it does mean that taking the other guys stuff has always been intended to be a driver of player activity.
---
And no, I don't think dogmatically everywhere should be full loot or that there is no place for some asset safety. Eve is a persistent game and there needs to be some places to store that progress. But POSes were a content driver, as are Upwells in wormholes today. There is some middle ground here where players can take items or resources from other players as a motivator to play the game as intended and attack, and maybe more importantly defend your stuff instead of letting the magic asset safety fairies whisk your whole region's worth of stuff to lowsec because there is no incentive to defend what you have. 
---
This is obvious to everyone, including CCP. Changes to asset safety are coming. No, not everywhere, but something needs to be done to get people both attacking and defending again instead of turtling and logging out which have come the norm in recent years.
---
Here's where someone comes and whines about WHs being super safe and filled with wealthy risk averse krabs.
---
Do your own homework......
---
1-2 hours per evening is fine. You have a different set of things you're able to do. Like the other reply said, sometimes fleeting up and getting the fleet in position to fight takes a significant chunk of time. So PvE, exploration, industry, market trading, solo PvP can fill the gaps.
---
Still with the 'newbies need safety' fallacy, and in nullsec of all places. Do you imagine that new players join EVE and go to nullsec because they heard it's a good place to farm in safety?
---
They do so because they heard it was the most challenging and rewarding place to be, with the best people, in the whole hardcore spaceship shooter game, where actions have permanent consequences. Why shouldn't they have it?
---
When you dumb down EVE the good players leave and the useless krabs prosper. When it's made harder, the krabs cry long and hard that they should have to put in effort and be exposed to risk and engage in teamwork—but the universe improves. The sound of a healthy EVE is the moaning of carebears.
---
Eve login routine lol imagine logging in for anything other than jita market or pings xd
---
Yes yes! Thank you Gearbox for keeping this IP alive!
---
Cant go wrong with that. Same with Aeon - - nyx
---
Hyperion theme best theme bar none
---
There's always a few taxes on resources that aren't counted on the killboard, and we're probably about as close (in produced to destroyed ratio) as anyone rational would want the game to get with blackout. Maybe you want 40 mil and increasing T1 cruiser hulls, but most people do not.
---
People leaving the game are usually taking resources and isk out of circulation (unless they give their shit away). Consumables like fuel, ammo, and drones are... uhhh... consumed on a continuous basis. Shit gets lost 100% of the time. Not killed, but lost. I forgot I had a DST out in Derelik, and I discovered that a few days ago getting stuff from Podion.  I probably have 5-10 bil worth in stuff spread around the galaxy, and so do you, and so does everyone who's played for a few years and moved around a  bit. Those are resources that might as well not exist. 
---
The MER shows us that mined resources are below the amount destroyed, but that doesn't account for manufacturing margins or all those additional taxes on resources, and we do need to sink some resources from the economy atm.
---
But I'm just saying, it's more than just "mined/produced should equal destroyed".
---
Are you baiting already? XD
---
Or many struggle to replicate it because of accessibility issues (no alts, no money, no skills, no brain)
---
Whoop!  Willing to break all the rules for Homeworld. I’ll buy the preorder, probably a collectors edition too if it’s put together well too.    Might even take some PTO to play as well.
---
My hopes are up, Homeworld is the best.

Well said. A bet on human stupidity is seldom placed in error.

We are smart enough to make sure bots are not in test proper, our rental groups are another story
---
i got called bot because when red entered local and hit the grid i was warping away lol
---
what was i supposed to do? stay on and get killed?
---
My Corp is filled with several newbros and a surprising amount of returning oldbros like myself. There is a ton to do in every area of the game. Lots have resubbed or new subbed.     
---
The number online itself is down but the % of that number actually it in space playing feels up. Completely agree with you there. CCP is even flat banning entire corps for botting/other TOS violations. I think it's a great time to play!
---
if they dont call imerium it would be TEST vs EVE,you dont want that narrative dont you?
---
Like over half my Corp has quit after the blackout, we are lucky to have 3 people online when we would normally have 7-8 people
---
Wrong, cap are not the problem, the problem is that there are too many toon that can use them in no time.
---
Thanks injectors for killing the game 😠
---
Firstly, I'm making the assumption that Shield Slaves *will be a thing soonish*, and that the massive advantage Armor Slaves(whatever they are) will become moot when shield Super pilots can increase buffer by the same margin.
---
The conventional wisdom is that armor capitals are better for buffer tanking because EANMs are passive, give omni-resists, and economically only take one fitting slot. The shield equivalent is *active*, which is a liability under heavy cap pressure. Passive shield regen is good in some circumstances... at least that's what the `it would have lived if it were a shield super` meme would have me believe.
---
# Goals:
---
1. Resistances should be similar to an Aeon, when both Aeon and Wyvern are both passive buffer fit. Survivability is determined by remote-repair power, which depends on resistances. 
---
2. Don't buff/nerf any other ship via module changes.
---
# My submission:
---
    4% bonus to all shield resistances ==&gt; 4% bonus to the effectiveness of all modules that require the Shield Upgrades skill.
---
This buffs all passive resistance modules, extenders, and rechargers.
---
# Why the fuck would you do that, Pickle?
---
EAMNs are fucking great. Adding a shield EANM would affect all shield ships. Without adding one, there's only so much that can be done. So I picked the next best thing; buff the other passive modules **only when they're on the Wyvern**.
---
It's a straight +20% buff to Extenders fitted on the Wyvern. At `Caldari Carrier V,` it's the equivalent of the +400% hull bonus being a +500% hull bonus. Remember, this doesn't affect resists.
---
Rechargers are collateral damage here. I never meant to include them. Thankfully, my maths suggests there's only a 3-4% *change* in regen dps.
---
The fun bit is what happens to passive resistance amps.
---
Here's what happens to EM Ward Amps.

# Comparing it to the Golden Space Couch.
---
Pyfa'ed some quick Aeon and Wyvern fits. Biggest difference between them was the Aeon was 3x plate fit, and the Wyvern only 2x extender. Screenshots of the fits below, but I basically had to trade resistance for more buffer and rely on what's left to be good enough. 
---
A picture is worth a thousand words. 
---

---
A buffed Wyvern has a Kinetic resist hole at `83.5%` but generally has higher resistances than an Aeon, which spans `83.9%` to `87.9%`. 
---
# Future work.
---
I actually think this might be *too much* of a buff. 
---
You'll see in those images that I have an offline Damage Control, and few PDS. I decided that the fairest comparison would be between all-lows and all-mids. A Wyvern using twelve module slots for tank isn't very representative. Nine slots (mids + Damage Control) is in the realms of plausibility, and I am concerned that it could push the scales too far towards the Wyvern. 
---
I suspect a 3% per level might be safer. But I'd need to experiment with more fits than the two I listed here.
---
Also neither of their discord names are that lol
---
You can explore relic sites for salvage, then manufacture rigs using the salvage you find.  That’s what I do.
---
Bot aspirants are worse than literal bots. Literal bots are just victims of their programming.
---
If Outposts were destroyable from the get-go, only then would the norm have been to move-it-or-lose-it. 
---
Unfortunately, they weren't, so that never was the norm.
---
Industry can be very difficult to jump into. The general rule is you want to make an item that there's both a market for and profit in making. Find those items and produce them, but be careful to not produce more than the market will buy.
---
In general, as an alpha player, you want to create an alt on a separate account if you're going to do something with no skill overlap. However, the bulk of the alpha-able industry skills are just skills for using rigs, and there aren't even many of those, so you'll be fine.
---
As an alpha player, there is not much in the way of industry that you *can* do. You should be able to make T1 ships, but I guarantee none of them will be profitable for you. You should be able to make T1 modules, but be aware that most T1 modules are primarily used for manufacturing their T2 counterparts, since meta modules are plentiful, cheap, and better than the T1 versions. You should be able to make the blueprints from ghost sites, which is definitely profitable, and you should be able to make T1 rigs, which is likely profitable depending on which rigs you make.
---
As a new player trying out industry, I recommend picking a single T1 rig to make and sell. You want to keep things simple to start, so buy your inputs and use fuzzworks to verify that this approach will actually be profitable before you get the blueprint. In addition to bare profitability, you want to pick a rig that's in common use. The in-game market will tell you how many sell in a given day at your preferred market hub. (Jita will sell faster. Other hubs will let you sell at higher prices.)
---
I didn’t realize that Sansha’s Nation was so scared of TAPI. Doesn’t TAPI primarily target Angels?

It depends on the dread activity. If people think they can bait out and kill your dread, or get it to drop as loot, then probably yes. If people think they can gank your dread, then they'll probably try to do that rather than evict you.
---
Hey its just bots right? Its quite funny how the last drop was bots (lul) but now all of the sudden its players. Conveniently after the login events stopped we are seeing worse numbers. I find it all very peculiar, like maybe it was all connected..
---
1) No it doesn't?
---
2) Why can I still see how many people are undocked/ratting in any given system? Why aren't you against this? If you're against intel, make it be hard for both the guy who wants to make money and the guy who wants easy kills via cloaked cowardice
---
People died before in your "perfect intel" era.
---
3) I very much doubt you're a new player. Much more likely an old one who's posting this shit to validate his favourite playstyle.
---
The hunter is the only one allowed perfect intel it seems.

Fucking crybabies here. I hope CCP nerfs their intel too.

Crowd. Supers are still strong as fuck, but carriers are pretty weak. They haven't got a massive amount of health, can't track well, and can be defanged pretty easily. Oh yeah and no warp core bonus, so even an ibis can tackle you. Mine is staying in station indefinitely till I have a reason to actually use it. I have absolutely no interest feeding kills to bomber/t3c gangs.

Check combat logs, that tells you mostly what high slot and mid slots he is fitted with.
---
And figure out the rest by fitting lows the way you will fit a curse with the remaining cpu/powergrid.  Buffer/active depends on if you saw him repping.

Combat logs should be stored in text file somewhere... right?

Yeah. The Raven has three extra attachments under its right wing, the right wing is longer than the left wing, and both wings extend straight. The Golem meanwhile has both wings equal length, only one extra right wing, and both main wings fold down to form a flat plane. (Also, the Raven has two control towers on its top side, which the Golem doesn't have.)

Nah thats my Golem. The Raven has big spikes under the right wing.

Funny I’ve noticed very few bots since black out. Bots were easy to spot as drones were recalled within a second of you entering local whilst you were still cloaked. Maybe in some instances it was someone on the ball with cloaky eyes watching a gate but when 5 ishtars named:

sunshine fast car 1 
---
Sorry cat game 5

PRAISE BOB!
---
&gt; [...] the core problem which is shields bad resist profile when out of juice.
---
That is a largely irrelevant issue in practice, mostly because cap transfers on fax are *way* better than neuts on dreads. Hell, faxes turn this supposed weakness into a substantial advantage - active hardeners give better resists to begin with *and* can be heated for additional resists.
---
-- 
---
The real issue Wyverns (and Aeons) face is that their primary bonus is useless outside a few specialist roles. They're essentially the command ships of supercap fleets - you want a handful to provide your shield/armor links and that's it.
---
'Fixing' them would most likely include increasing their fighter bay to match their counterpart, possibly even giving them a larger one.

That’s the guy who follows that streamer around whoring on his kills.

I think i had a different, but related experience yesterday. I had heated my warp disruptor to point someone, but after they died and i "repaired" it with nanite paste, it still showed 72% damage. Right clicking and repairing again did nothing, but the option was there and it said it would take 1 nanite. Session change via gate jump did not resolve, but relogging did (showed mod had no heat damage).
---
Overall, it seems like there may be a new bug based activating a tackle mod the same tick the target dies.
---
You have to be logged in to be docked. My subs all lapse in about three weeks. I might break, but I think Hilmar might've finally broken the sunken cost fallacy for me. On the plus side, I discovered DOTA 2. Better late than never!

Yea, and it’s refreshing to see someone mention that, many just say that it’s a bot if you recall when they jump in, like I’d rather not be isk negative that night
---
A good hunter who gets salty they failed a snag and complains their target was a bot when it wasn't has the same end result as a bad hunter complaining they couldn't catch their target either.
---
Not disputing your original point. But good hunters make false complaints too.

Thank you for stating the obvious...

It depends on where in the drone lands, and it depends on what you mean by "viable". The hard requirements are about 100m isk per TCU you plant, 500m isk per IHUB you plant, and let's say 500m isk per citadel you plant. (You'll want to plant at least one Raitaru, probably more.) If that seems like too much to throw away, don't try for sov.
---
Taking sov should be pretty easy. Find some groups and poke them with cheap entosis ships until one of them fails to defend. Once that happens, anchor your stuff. Remember that you have to entosis your own TCU and IHUB to turn them on!
---
Holding sov depends on what you want to do with it. As a small entity, your main universal dangers are going to be (1) the local Powers deciding you're an easy "victory" to boost morale, and (2) sov-pokers like you were who think that smaller targets means softer targets. You can probably sense how I feel about this, but there are many groups in the game that like to punch down, and you're going to be right at the bottom.
---
If you're hoping to PVE, then watch out for nearby PVP entities that might want to farm you for kills. I don't have much experience with this myself, but that's what I'd look out for. If you're hoping to PVP, then understand that the space might be empty because the local *PVE* entities are systematically squishing any threats to their miners and ratters. (I do have experience with this. They were friendly and apologetic, but the only way I was going to be allowed to stay would be if I blued them.)

Swing ... and a miss.

Thanks man! Persistence paid off today

Sounds class keep the good working going are you boys recruiting 😉😉
---
Hello again Plebius,
---
Myself and the group I am in use carriers a few times a week in PVP scenarios and I see no issue with them not having a warp core bonus, weakness in being "defanged", and without module assistance or mix of supporting fighters cannot track well. Otherwise, they would be too strong against subcapital ships as they were before. I think if I were to aim to fight subcaps I would use the tracking modules and a squad of webbing-fighters mixed with the light-fighters. 
---
I hope you find the opportunity to use your carrier outside of ratting! Have a nice day!
---
Nothing you say makes a bit of sense. Please, stop being an idiot.

And this is why feigned stupidity is such a fantastic cloaking device

Literally the risk you take in WH/low/null.

If you dont like it, go play something nicer. Like minecraft. You can mine and nobody will ever bother you.
---
From when I tried my hand at that a couple of years ago, I was going for frigs/dessies/cruisers on the basis that they wouldn't have time and/or tank to catch reps. 
---
Once the numbers start going up, you might have random logi coming in so you have to keep that in mind before going after anything that'll take more than a dozen seconds to hose down.
---
Also, going after BC's/BS's with just a point runs the risk of them hitting the GTFO button (MJD if they have one fitted)... it's basically a case of taking as many as you can with you in a fight like that.
---
That said, in my (slightly) drunken state I ended up trying my luck against sabre's and a hyena of all things! Which didn't result in anything except wasted ammo... unless they're hard tackled, there's no point going after something like that.

I bet it had a neut.

Yep, this is right. Grab some small and medium BPOs and start researching them while you go out and get relic loot.
---
Check the market for which rigs at least have high volume and some profit based on material cost.
---
*yakity sax playing*
---
Or better yet when starting off, see if you can find someone who will make you some Bpc's on the cheap. T1 small and medium rig bpc's are a dime a dozen.

I’m fine but thanks! It’s not venom, it’s education for your short memory TAPI line members that don’t understand how they are helping killing the game they love because of koolaid narratives.

Well, they wouldn't have been my first choice either. On the other hand we've not heard anything out of them for a long time, and some people do calm down when they get older.

Yeah, and apparently worked so well that botters adapted far better and quicker than legit players.

Nowadays Blackout help botters because people can't scout them easily through local...
---
In 2020, TAPI will have everyone blued and wouldn't need to even call, enjoy the meme while it lasts.
---
The only people CCP were pandering to was themselves making as little work as possible. If they had come out as fort sizes only having asset safety that would have been fine, but now they have opened a can of worms that is very hard to put back in. 
---
I am citing Outposts because they existed and citadels were replacing them. If those didn't have asset safety when they came out people would have just kept using the old outposts over the citadels and CCP wanted to encourage people to move to their new feature.
---
Lmao at thinking you know TAPI's history while not knowing ron.
---
People already don't kill citadels that can drop piles of assets for you to gather, this wont increase peoples desire to do that.

Why do you keep 15 years of stuff in one, destructable place....

---
Sorry I missed it. Glad to see folks having fun in one of Eve’s best regions.
---
Its like everyome forgot when pl laughed in the face of test and goons when they dropped shield super fleet on their full avatar blob and just got smoked so bad logins didnt happen for days. Sheild supers are fine where they are, only people who refuse to do a different playstyle think they are bad
---
You all advertise on Less than 10. Nice AAR!
---
TunDraGon and Project Abscond are INIT
---
Actchually: Pidgin is the client, XMPP is the chatserver protocol being used.
---
Basically, we use a stable EvE chat backend.
---
And that before CCP tried to use it.
---
Clever, aren't we?
---
It's online now
---
Even though ecm is fucked you can remote tracking disrupt with tracking range scripts. So the excuse of not being able to hold the field against a single carrier is just matter of poor ship choices.
---
Loki is pretty great, kiki, drek and leshak are all a bit OP. I probably spend most time in my passive rattlesnake krabbing C3s though.

This is a pretty good suggestion going by the fact it got downvoted pretty hard.

anything would be better than their current Youtube ad that is just them explaining how you can buy PLEX to get in ingame currency for the better part of 5 minutes.
---
I had (I dont play eve atm but may return) a legion fit and it was fun and stupidly tanky and cheap. But at the price of a max speed of 1200ms woth oh mwd, and a actibe tank, it was not worth it to pull it out over a just buffer Loki
---
You couldn't ship your stuff from a station you'd lost control of back into lowsec.
---
You couldn't drop stations at the drop of a hat for 600m ISK. There wasn't a station in every system.

Next time kill the skiff's drones dood. Was a good read though.

---
I love you Malcanis, but INIT leadership lost a lot of credibility on that front when they decided to recruit 0WNED and screw over their entire USTZ FC team last year. If the strategy is to grab anyone who's not an absolute bottom feeder and then kick the toxic corp leadership, like happened with 0WNED, I gotta wonder what that really accomplishes.
---
Love the old school graffiti letters. Great work!
---
In general alpha clones are doers not producers. What this means is that you have the cards stacked against you if you attempt to do industry at any scale as an alpha. You can perhaps supply yourself with basic equipment, but even then you're better off doing something else for more isk and then buying the equipment yourself.
---
All that said exploration is an amazing profession for an alpha. I actually recommend newer players create two alpha clones, one for combat one for exploration. This way you can train quickly and utilize the most out of the 1 million bonus skill points from the Buddy code.
---
As an explorer and an alpha you have no cloak. This means you have no real defence at all. The best exploration is in wormholes and null Sec. You're going to want to learn how to probe and hack to do the various relic and data sites. Given that you have no real way to protect yourself, your tank is how disposable your stuff is. A ship that cost less than a million isk can go into a wormhole and with any luck at all pull out over a hundred million. Even if only one in a hundred survive, they pay for themselves. Trust me, more than one in 100 survive. doing this will teach you what kind of dangers are really out there and when you go Omega, and get a cloak, you have a better appreciation and knowledge of how to protect your self without relying solely on having a cloak.

CCP have done some reconstruction on their API, so "as far as I know" its not that easy to pull out data anymore.  All the tutos I have visited are not working.
---
There are still loads of websites with this info to import from.
---
" So, you’re clearly not expecting a release this decade \[what’s left of  it\], what would you consider a proper time where ‘I think it’s about  time they released it’? "
---
Tbh, the real core fans of Star Citizen (me included and i know quite a few others that think alike), dont mind waiting perhaps another decade. Atm they are including all "new" features in the alpha, basically every few months. Even these "small features" are actually quite fun to explore while waiting for the game. So far, over the past years, ive played Star Citizen on an off for sometimes weeks at the time. 
---
The real thing im looking forward to is really when everything is added what they are planning to do. Real size planets that are totally walkable, Multiple solarsystems, Buildable outposts and so on. Implementing that all with high quality takes a shitton of time, and Star Citizen has proven to take the time for it. In my opinion, this is the best thing you can have if you really want to have a very beautiful game with a shitton of content that (hopefully) can be played for decades (maybe even over a hundred years?) once it comes out.
---
Upvote for propaganda post, anything to break up the bitch fest of the past few months is fantastic.

Awesome story and can tell you're stoked about it, that is a really shitty fitted carrier so you did luck out but still sounds fun =)
---
I did start with graffity 18 years ago ;) So i asume old School is right. Was fun to combine 2 intrests from me.
---
Large if factual
---
Correct but if CCP wants to decommission stations like they did, the feature replacing them needed to have parity. CCP dropped the ball by letting the medium size ones have asset safety, but forts and keeps needed it if they were going to replace stations.
---
Also you could ship things out of stations you didn't control, or use a spy, or sell them.
---
There is a definite trend towards wanting to give an excuse to yourself as to why you failed instead of admitting the other guy did what they were suppose to, however, there are some repeated patterns and awkward moments when these programs break that make it obvious that you're not dealing with a human.
---
Typically, they'll mention somewhere they post on r/eve.
---
Joke aside, I get both sides of the discussion here, yeah not all krabs are bots and yeah some hunters are shit. There are plenty of bots though.

The idea of having walkable planets is going to be deeply problematic. On the one hand you’re going to have vast wastes of nothing, like Mars, or ice worlds like Europa and Enceladus. That’s going to be the bulk of your planets. Very highly detailed wastelands of rock. Not really exciting.
---
Or, you’re going to have Earth-like planets. And then you would need the kind of diversity a simple design team cannot muster. It’s just way too much work.
---
Also, what about gravity on your worlds? Is it always going to be the same? Conveniently pleasant for Earth dwellers?
---
I like the ideas behind what they are trying to do but some of them are, using current technology, impractical or impossible to implement. It’s going to be fun to land on a planet, it is not going to be much fun to see rocks horizon to horizon.
---
I can see where the vision is inspiring, but the reality is going to be a bit more involved.
---
Also, for all the fancy graphics I see the Mac, as a platform, is not supported. Really? All that time and money, can’t build a Mac version. I’m not impressed.

You’re prepared to wait another decade. You’re a trooper. I’m seeing Chris Roberts is getting on in years. If it takes another 10 years, he’s going to be fully employed the whole time and then he’s going to retire and ‘pass on the torch’. Much like the early adopters, whose children will be of college age at the time and eagerly looking forward to what the old man has been going on about for all those years.
---
After twenty years [if that’s what it’ll take] I can imagine a lot of interest having waned because life will have taken place and stuff had to be done that was more important and, when it does finally sees a release, I can’t think of a greater disappointment for all these people than to feel the sentiment “Yeah, hey, great job guys. But you know, I really don’t feel the vibe anymore and I don’t have time to play. The wife needs a new car, the kids have to go to school. Give it to the new kids.” and then you just shrug off.
---
20 years. You’re not going to be the same person, you’ll have developed different interests, it’ll be too late and, sad but true, not really what you wanted, not what you expected.

If there is one thing to fear it is the day the magic goes away. Life will do that to you.

Frat's leader very much wants to kill TEST.  Keeps going to war against TEST.  This last time, Frat abandoned the NIP with TEST that was negotiated after the last time Frat lost.
---
The war's been going on for a few months.  It's not going well for Frat, but game mechanics mean it's a long, long grind.
---
PH has been coming by and helping Frat since the start of the war.  PL just came down to also help Frat.  According to r/Eve, neither of these is a batphone.
---
With much of PanFam now directly involved, TEST talked to Goons.  Which r/Eve insists is a terrible batphone and TEST must be doing terrible to do it.  r/Eve also likes to forget TEST has a new Keepstar in Frat space, since that would kinda cause a problem for the claims TEST isn't doing well.
---
in eve there are various isk making schemes available, not to alpha players though. especially not for alphas. most of these schemes require multiple omega accounts to pull off to any desirable degree of satisfaction.  and those schemes themselves, often change as events or sales, or whatever, changes in eve.  there are various people who make a great deal of effort to figure these things out and if you think that they are lining up to tell people on reddit about it, well, maybe this game isnt for you.
---
fill yer boots
---
What about Bastion?
---
Some folks on r/Eve started it to annoy TEST.  Test ran with it to annoy those people.
---
It works for about 20% of people, most can't even install it, so count yourself lucky.

The more I look at this comment, the less intelligible it becomes.

---
What about PL?

looks like the stuff i used to see in the early 2000s, nice
---
My phone cost more than 1 month Eve subscription so I guess that helps

When will NC and PL join the Goons?

I'm not sure, I always called them TEST but then I saw people calling them TAPI. I just thought that by acronym it made more sense.

lol Running Android 8.0 myself paid a hell of alot more than Eve Sub and it can't run the app.

Try reading the official forum at some of the specs being posted by people using pretty expensive phones and up to date OS's who cant run the app.

It's an honour. I've got tons of saved images from the old rivalries of Eve. I always thought they were really fun. I encourage everyone to get involved.

take your time, collect your data and make a reddit post he'll read it.

Then get the data and present it like a competent player who wants to sway minds and make change

---
And if you're not being called a bot for having good reflexes, you get called a carebear for doing PvE.
---
ANY. PvE. Even when you're trying to earn a sweet deadspace module or BPC.
---
Let's see the facts and the data
---
So is that where you stand? Because I don't think that's a solution either.
---
All I can say is if CCP believed that there is data showing that blackout has been as terrible as how empires are portraying it, I'm pretty sure they would have taken it back. They didn't promise anything permanent. They have been under sheer metagame pressure by nullsec empires. And there is no reason for them to commit to a change that indicates bottom line losses.
---
So just maybe; the kind of data you're looking for is accessible only by CCP. And the null empires, Mittens etc can't really claim to make a healthy judgment on it just by looking at the PCU and the non-global data they have been internally collecting. 
---
Per Noizygamer's tweet: I'm not really surprised non-umbrella regions suffered more MER losses than the umbrella regions. Most of the farming in non-umbrella regions came from bots.
---
Use GESI
---
Yes, they were simulated in sense that those were not real players but as the server saw this there was no difference between those and real players since those were pretty much clients with no graphical interface doing some basic movements, now in eve when imperium was deploying for war we would get the whole region to go into tidi whith idk, 2-3k clients. As for building, it is quite complex and so there was no point in wasting the dev time into making bots to do so. As for wasting money? Depends on your perspective, I spent less than I was spending on eve per month and I got almost a year worth of playtime out of it so even if it is a scam I got my money's worth out of it

we can't use the data on dropping number of players logging in to say that this is not working? you do know that fewer people logged into the game is bad for the future of the game right?
---
Amazing you see this..  Apparently the mouthbreathing leet pvp crowd  can't understand that when you throw shit at the wall and people start logging off in droves it's not good for have targets to be leet about.
---
LOL  Tapi Anchors Keepstar, Leet Pvpers batphone each other to kill it.  TAPI asks Goons for help, Leet PvPers turtle up and cry on reddit.
---
Do you... read what you post?
---
Take yourself out of your EXTREME bias, back up, and read this tinfoil hat "only ccp has the full truth and will take care of us out of love" conspiracy theory.  
---
If they're hiding data, that's bad enough, but if they're publishing deliberately damning evidence on top of that, that's a psychotic stupidity that beggars belief.
---
Seriously dude, there's a time to think instead of just preach
---
No local happens, 90% of NC and PL renters leave. NOPE, no bots here.
---
&gt; you do know that fewer people logged into the game is bad for the future of the game right?
---
The only global data accessible to players on this is PCU. If most of the PCU drop can be attributed to botter, cloaky camper, Rorqual 15-boxer, afk VNI 10-boxer etc. account; then the game might be just fine (or just not horribly worse off).
---
There's also a "Superweapon_AOEECM" listed under burst projectors.
---
HEY! Just now I flew a jackdaw and pressed F!
---
*Where is your narrative now?*
---
do you have the proof that the drop off is due to botters?
---
This is the first time I've ever seen one of these comics where the guy *deserved* defenestration.
---

---
What, 4chan?

So I am saying a for-profit company wouldn't jeopardize profits for no apparent reason at all. And you are saying they would and even mess with data, just because, .... they must hate money....? And according to you, I'm the conspiracist here lol.
---
Gosh literally how much koolaid are they serving you?
---
Just don't be a poor and become a "cool kid" by subscribing.
---
Anyways, it's him playing is always silly "meta" game. Why do you even want to react?
---
No. Do you have proof that is saying otherwise?
---
Why do you assume players can access the kind of data you're looking for?
---
This is the eve equivalent of EA calling loot boxes “surprise mechanics”
---
How can you not install the app?
---
I found it to be good practice that there is at least one person patiently speaking the truth against the sheer game-corroding koolaid these people have been serving for years. Turns out people sharing the opposite playstyle don't do it a lot because of most of us aren't into the social aspect of this game as much as empire builders and linemembers. But then we have this game with 1/5th of the game's population controls more than half of the player voice and influences the game itself. So someone has to speak up.
---
isn't it a "bias" to believe if CCP don't show you all their data they can't do notting else than lie ?
---
CCP don't owe us anything, Mittani ask for something no one can provide, how convinient
---
Some people with Android phones that can't run the Unreal engine are unable to run the app at the moment but we're gathering feedback and are working to improve compatibility.
---
I usually don't make posts, but assuming if this has to do with black out, Olmeca is right that the data needed is owned by CCP. I am skeptical CCP would know as they keep fucking up everything.
---
Attributing pcu to black out proves my point that Eve players in general are dense. There are a  ton of reasons why besides black out for the drop. 
---
FW is getting boring, player burnout, the blue doughnut people keep whining about here, Incursions nerfed to force ppl to do triv invasions, Triv npc's shitting on people in high sec, and etc.
---
Also, who is Omeca? I see this person's name is thrown around a lot. Is this person that special from being a csm?

I'm getting the same Not Compatible error that many others are getting from Google.

TL;DR: everyone in EvE vs. TEST
---
Yup. Everytime I run a haven I do love the tension I get in the end when a faction battleship spawns. Always on the edge of my chair when the last battleships spawns.
---
CCP said they made 1 Billion € Profit with eve. Since Crucible they didn't put money into eve again. They put 600 Devs sometimes in the past on different Projects all that Projects failed. EVE their Cash Cow is still not on their AGENDA. WE just have Falcon left from a whole community team which we once had. We have under 10 Dev's working on EVE. We don't have devblogs for Rework of Subcaps (t1 Destroyer - BS) we dont have devblog about Tactical Ships. We dont have Devblog about any changes/rework new content and mechanics for Lowsec, Hi Sec, Nullsec or Wormhole space. Factionwarfare is still shit and no update. WE don't have any work of devtime for anything. No big rebalances, rework, no inventions! And don't let me start on the UI and new player experience.
---
Lol you guys are still salty about blackout and cyno changes.
---
Yes.
---
Issue has already been confirmed by CCP, see CCP Convicts post in this very thread. It affects many different brands, including Samsung, LG, Nokia, Huawei etc and has something to do with the Unreal engine the app is built on.
---
Well. Maybe some of you who designed it. :9
---
If you think that just continuing in the direction of the last few years is the answer then you're part of the problem. It might be uncomfortable for your game but big changes are badly needed.
---
And lol at Mittani thinking players are making the call on blackout. Only CCP has the data that matters and they are making decisions based on what they think is healthiest for the game.
---
Confirm you want GESI.
---
https://github.com/Blacksmoke16/GESI
---
And yet your hate boner inspired opinion that is also unsupported by data is correct? Doubtful
---
My best piece of advise I can give is to just join up, doesn't matter a whole lot what race you start with but the Gallente industrial ships have almost always been a favorite among industrial players. Joining a group like Eve-Uni will be your first move in my opinion.
---
So start up, Call it SP instead of XP and seek out Eve-University and join with them so you can learn the game properly.
---
But then you dropped a Fort for goons about three days later and the rest is history I suppose.
---
Sorry to break it to you bud, but a good chunk has to be trade bots/alts. A large number of systems has ppl logged on that never leave and sit  in station. Depending on which system you can have dozens or a few as I had done a lot of missioning in several systems (near trade hubs). These people stayed in station for multiple days in a row and I noticed this while grinding standings (it usually took a week or 2 8-10 hours consistently).
---
I have just returned recently like in particular for season of kills. Compared to 2013 when I stopped, high sec mining is pretty much dead as belts are usually empty. A lot of toons sitting in station and never leaving the system. Jita being the worst when trying to play the market game.
---
Continuing the direction of the last few years is death. The game is stale and needs to be woken up.
---
No aar, no details just a link

i’m glad you had zkill open and had the ability to copy and paste

I’m not glad you copy pasted it here

You know what, I just checked and I can’t install it on my 2013 Nexus 7, I know CCP was dropping 32-bit, but this has gone too far!
---
Edit: /s for the above Nexus 7 hit EOL years ago.
---
aar?
---
My opinion is trusting CCP on that they'd read the relevant data and cut blackout after the 2nd week if it was as horrible for the game as nullsec has been claiming. So my opinion doesn't need to be based on any data. The official nullsec opinion does need to be grounded on data, which they cannot even access, so that should tell you how one-sided the opinion is.

Great fight, even a few kills against barghs are a huge deal, so the fight was much closer than it looks.
---
After breaking on barghs, we decided to test the tank on the blap phoenixes. They died, and the fight was mostly decided.

Big balls as always, and see you in the next brawl!

thanks mate. I will see how to join them. thanks.

Yeah we decided to go with an actual game engine for the app this time since it will allow us to do a lot more things with it in the long term. However that means some phones aren't able to run it currently. It's not so much the brands but certain models. Sorry that includes you, friend.
---
On a side note it still feels really strange referring to CCP as "we" and not "they". I guess I'll get used to it.

https://zkillboard.com/kill/78714308/#  Yeah we killed a carrier last night to. AAR he was baiting on station and got dunked
---
This is...true, but not the whole story. Most HAW dreads can slow down the enemies enough to get hits, but small/quick frigs or ceptors are different. Only the Phoenix can generally hit super fast and small ships up close, because of missile damage application.
---
Depending on the Dread type, they really \*should\* focus on the middle-ground or BS in the fleet, since they can apply damage fully and quickly. Ya, it'll be harder to kill a BS with HAW guns, but if you can apply 100% of damage it doesn't matter unless they have Logi.
---
Except the whole point is to have CCP provide the data that their method is working. From all the data that is available to the public, the Imperium's data nerds have analyzed it and come to the conclusion that the way that CCP is handling things is not working to improve the current situation and it's making things worse. With this data, they can present it to CCP through their CSM representatives in hopes that CCP provides evidence otherwise or acknowledges the situation. If things keep going the way they are, CCP is risking doing irreversible damage to Eve, and Eve will likely die.

Yea it also doesn't seem to be based on age either, as some older phones can run it, while newer phones can't. My phone is 8 months old and can't run it.

heard about it from where o;

he's a goon bully (and got elected for that) he push CCP to make some change hurting goon and other big enough alliance who have an umbrella, nerf supercap make them easier to kill something like that...  
---
of course blackout is a "problem" because this change need to be accompagned with other big change but it's neccesary, 100% safe supercap farm need to go, they can increase the risk even if it hurt the smaller entity more than the big one but they just gonna give free money if they increase the reward in NS before a rework of null PvE (anom spawn &gt; remove umbrella)  
---
Eve should't be Grind-Online a more cruel universe but much more rewarding that's what CCP want to do i believe, hope they don't make a "CCP" i don't want to wait 2year

This is the thing people cheering the falling player numbers just don't seem to grasp, if after 16 years of trying to attract and keep massive numbers of new players failed. How is driving out the existing player base suddenly going to reverse that trend and "save" the game? Its the inverse of the Field of Dreams plot instead of building "it" and hoping players will come CCP is burning "it" down and thinking that will somehow magically draw new blood to the game.
---
Imagine being excited about camping High-secs only to jump through when people show up to fight. This is why WiNGSPAN is dead.

Needs more cap boosters tbh
---
I'd say very few carriers would have the presence of mind to do that, and then keep doing it every single time they cycle guns on a target (since the orbit reverts to default at that point). Still, it just takes too many disruptors to make it worth it.

That's lower then I expected.

Is the data wrong?

I'm sure this won't generate significant drama

The data is that the PCU is falling, and that the number of active players in space is falling. If you have data that disagrees with that, then show it.

When your alliance infrastructure gets to be so costly you have to squeeze your citizens for the isk/resources to maintain it.

Interesting, but wpuldent that be a better fit for t3C's?

Speaking as someone that loves blackout and thinks the cyno changes are good.  it doesn’t leave out the fact that eve in my TZ consistently had 20k+ logged into tranquility.  Now when I look it’s about 14k.  You can’t tell me that’s healthy for the game.

So... -5000 horde and +5000 goons and people will bitch goons got bigger?
---
What's the word on the Samsung S8? I just got one a few weeks ago...

spoken like someone who hasn't had to deal with the risk being made 100x worse thanks to the blackout.  Can't take anything other than expedition frigates out now.  Seems senseless that the hunters can see if people are in a system, look up recent kills, npc death, etc etc but we krabs get no intel what-so-ever and are being slaughtered.

&gt; Gallente industrial ships have almost always been a favorite among industrial players.

Its easy to see why, the gallente T1s have all the special holds. The only one they are missing is ammo; all of the industrial ones are gallente only.
---
Kyros for minerals, miasmos for ore, epithal for PI, and nereus for dual webs and a point (its for checking the tires)
---
None of them hold a ton, and are not super useful for more than high sec or local use, but they are just about throwaway for the price. I keep a full set of them and use them for little personal hauling jobs all the time.
---
Though, for any bulk or any distance, its usually worth it to just contract it to the JF bro and pay him to haul it for me.
---
tell me more about wormhole bushido.

Yup, that's a fair point.

Though people wouldn't hold it against you, if you did get that mass. Hence my assumption of it being acceptable.

Olmeca Gold made a name for himself last year running huge numbers of Pontifex accounts to steal Excavator Mining Drones from Goon Rorquals. He subsequently started publishing statistics on his adventures, and quickly got a reputation on /r/eve for making very long and wordy posts, and being *the* biggest source of people crying "grr goons". So when he then ran a successful CSM campaign on the back of an hour-long self-biopic, he's pretty much become the giant face of the "grr goons" narrative. Or if not the face, the designated punching bag.

Sure. For evictions you seed a ton even if it's pointless and max form, and for honour brawls if it fits through a wormhole it's cool.

Honestly wondering to who at this point.  Wondering why the downvotes but literally no responses
---
Welcome to r/eve you will never find a worst Hive of scum and villainy
---
What the fuck ever, you guys cyno in super fleets to chase off nano.
---
&gt;Only CCP has the data that matters and they are making decisions based on what they think is healthiest for the game.
---
I rather doubt the changes recently were driven by data.
---
meaning, that they didn't made these changes because the data showed it would have a positive impact on players logging in.
---
I think CCP Hilmar finally accepted that the game has been for several years on a slow but gradual path towards an inevitable death, and decided to call of drastic changes to be implemented to see if they can start swinging things in the opposite direction, basically the equivalent of throwing shit at the wall and hope that it sticks.
---
And they decided to put their focus on the issue that the eve vets here on r/eve constantly complain about it for the past few years.
---
Honestly, despite my playstyle not being affected by the recent changes (lowsec pirate) i rather feel that the CCP focus to be rather misplaced at the moment.
---
Although i do agree that the trends in nullsec were unsustainable, that's not whats causing the player retention numbers for eve online to be so incredibly poor, what good is it to fight so hard to keep an extra 10 vets in the game slightly longer, when 20 quit for reasons that are unrelated to the health of the game, and more to do with those people just getting old and not having enough time or motivation to invest in the game, and at the same time, only being able to keep 1 or 2 people who try the game, (i made up these numbers but you get my point, eve online hasn't been able to recruit enough new players to keep up with the attrition of old players simply quitting), and i honestly don't see how any of the recent or announced changes will change that picture, it might temporally slow down the bleeding but its not going to stop it, eve online player retention sucks, and that's where ccp should be putting all their effort into fixing it, otherwise we will one day in the not too distant future be able to finally legitimately say, that eve online is dead.

It’s the end of August. PCU is always down.
---
Ofoc won't even bring nano into our home with any frequency. Sad!
---
Should be saying that to novac lmao
---
surely CCP doesn't habitually misread their own data, increasingly nervous man screams
---
Yes, but it is also down previously too.  August is 1 month out of the year. Activity has been falling all year.
---
'if'
---
In reality you should be 7 barghs down, and given you keep saying how even a few matters, potentially should've lost.
---
There will be a writeup on it soon. This is the gist of it:
---
\&gt; Industry dir says he wants R1O market to be top 5 in game  
---
\&gt; All refining possibilities for moon and ice not available in Athanors starting tomorrow, refining can still be done near R1O  
---
\&gt; Takes over PennysBuyback. All moongoo and ice mined in TKE must be sold to alliance buyback.  
---
\&gt; Buyback is *82% of Jita Buy @ 87.6% refine.* Refined products can be bought for 100% jita sell (can someone calculate effective tax on that?). Previous tax on moongoo refining in athanors was 12,5%  
---
\&gt; Somehow the refined products will be made available for members in corp/alliance contracts (sounds very convenient) to circumvent the Sales Tax sink.
---
Not true!  The UI received a major overhaul!
---
It’s more lucrative to just ninja moons in HiSec in that case.
---
Come to Domain, we got tons.
---
are u upset about possibly losing a spaceship in unfavorable circumstances at one point?
---
When you promote your own corps recruitment
---
We should be all the bhaals down, which was the plan before the Logger undocked.
---
I you don't buy money you're a krab.
---
I'm just sad that they'll never leave their home because of mass :(
---
Think we'll ever be able to jumpclone with the app?
---
lol, &lt;3
---
Why don’t you just quit already?
---
Killing Covetors = Elite
---
Imagine everyone falling for your flair bait... Moose.
---
Right? I came here to say that’s not how that meme works lol
---
Most instances not all. Most people are not botters.
---
Needs more brown.
---
Doesn't seem to matter if they're bots because krabs got shit for krabbing all the same long before botting became a rampant problem. People will always complain.
---
I'm not vested in this and I don't share the opinion but I believe its due to the fact that Iron always claimed to be independent, while their enemies often said they were a pet. Joining goons give credence to the pet claims, and kind of betrays that they were an independent group.... or some think perhaps. (just what I pieced together)
---
22,000 accounts banned for bottling/RMT as well.

Am kind of getting tired of HACs Online.

---
I mean it will take awhile since whyverns are the last supers to get shot in a fight.
---
That's why there can't be a compromise. It can't go both ways.
---
That's correct. Data analytics is Kool-Aid. This just in Olmeca\_Gold sits in the mud and declares that the Earth is flat and the moon is made out of cheese, and anyone who suggests he look at empirical evidence that 'proves' otherwise "has been snorting funny dust of the genitals of 'so called' scientists."

Have an S8+ works fine. There is a bit of a load time on first start up. And when I go to reorganize skills it takes a second the first time, and then it's a bit faster after that.
---
People getting angry at the blue donut is like wishing for global nuclear disarmament.
---
You don't have the data to make a judgment on the effects of blackout. I don't either. CCP does.
---
I cannot not love Mittani.
---
You all love to hate on him so much, you can’t  name any EVE character that has generated more content than The Mittani has..
---
&gt;All I can say is if CCP believed that there is data showing that blackout has been as terrible as how empires are portraying it, I'm pretty sure they would have taken it back. They didn't promise anything permanent. They have been under sheer metagame pressure by nullsec empires. And there is no reason for them to commit to a change that indicates bottom line losses.  
---
rofl, just like how they rolled back jump fatigue, iterated on fozzie sov, nerfed rorquals, tweaked asset safety, made citadels less safe... 
---
oh wait, those are things they left broken for years in some cases, causing thousands of players to quit.   
---
I personally like the blackout but seriously Olmeca? This is the argument you're making? CCP never iterates. They're famous for making awful choices and then doubling down on them. "Greed is Good" was famous because it's like the one time the community screamed so much that CCP actually changed their course. but that is the exception that proves the rule.
---
I don't have to have data for my position. All I do is trusting that CCP has it, and they will do their best judgment.
---
with their friends? sure. With randos on reddit just to make it seems like they really know what they're doing? doubtful
---
man, whats with Ehefkae and having [bhaals tossed at them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NitJUsoMxU).

Taxes and death, pleanty of both in EVE.
---
lol, I was about to ask the same exact question. Lasker does the same thing in his videos. I think the allure of a 'guaranteed kill' is just too much to resist - it's funny because a lot of the time, they miss better kills because of it. For example, in this case, there's a Gnosis who burns off after realizing the trash frigs are getting killed - a very easy kill that would remove a lot more DPS from the field than killing a Rifter or a Slasher!
---
Is it any different with carriers? DPS isn't as much obviously, but with fighters you have a ton of range flexibility and you can have a tackle wing. I think I want to whelp a Phoenix and a Chimera and I'm not sure what to plan for with the carrier.
---
Seraph plz
---
Also give me your rg icbf running sites
---
Props to ehfkae as usual.
---
Don’t let folks on here discourage you from industry! Can be a great path, even for alphas. Just might take awhile to make as much isk as exploring will. If you do choose industry, I would recommend finding a small tier trade hub (Rens, Hek, Stacmon, Dodoxie, etc) where stuff will be more expensive and thus more profitable to produce (though will sell slower) than Jita. Buy a few things you are interested in making, and then immediately list them for sale and see how long it takes to sell to give you a sense of volume.
---
Also for exploration, once you’ve trained the skills try out exploring in null sec and wormholes, the loot is exponentially better and the extra danger and harder mini games make it much more fun
---
The previous five years track record of messed up game balance by CCP is explained by an appeal to chasing short term cash over long term health of the game. There is no short term cash in blackout or cyno changes. If anything they are attempts to fix the long term negative game health effects of changes done a few years ago; Rorquals, injectors, capitals, et al. Blackout undeniably cut faucets.
---
They won't mess up with the game for no reason at all. And there is no reason for them to push blackout if it is as horrible as goons claim.
---
PS: also it isn't guaranteed to be permanent either so maybe it will be taken back. Who knows. Maybe it isn't as horrible as mittens is claiming but bad enough to take back. Maybe not. I have been very skeptical about CCP in the past but with this I trust them. So I would just bear with them.
---
I think this is more to build a cache of fuel for deployments as opposed to raw income. Still, it's nice to see them struggling with it.
---
And how many made a new account the next day?
---
??
---
Except botting has been a rampant problem for over a decade. It was called a botter's dream back in 2009 and Steve Bannon of all people since 2007 had partial ownership in a company that, among other mmos like WoW and EverQuest, ran botting and rmt in Eve.
---
As for carebears(what they were called prior to 'krab,' being coined), getting shit, of course they do. Just like they will call people who kill them tryhards, or no lifers, etc. This, as you say, isn't new and has been a thing since mmos became popular.
---
That and the fact that frigates do more dps per ehp was a good point. Most importantly, it seems like a BS has so much EHP that it has the time to either burn out of range and warp off, summon logi or use an MJD, making it kind of pointless to even try if you can't take it down in about 12 seconds.
---
Still, it kills me that the Leshak couldn't be taken down.
---
I mean....even with the slight overmass, has fun and I’d still form up again as I’m sure most of afk will.   Imagine risking a ship sometimes....
---
U keep on doing u thou. O7
---
EVE is my T H E R A P Y
---
It's always about the Point of View!
---
For example, many goons hated Elo because he threated someone in Real live over a game and got back to the game while been officially banned and blatant obvious about it while CCP did nothing about it for quite a while.
---
And here I was thinking the north couldn't possibly make any more dumb decisions.
---
When are you guys planning on getting some competence, 2030?
---
Who knows, prolly not many with IP/HD ban.
---
[Motherfucker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3X61zDcu4s)
---
The fact that you even know the mass of their fleet... it’s almost like wormhole FCs of the N+1 wormhole blobs are sitting there with pens and clipboards, like this is some sort of football match. Folks should just undock more, results be damned.
---
What am I missing? Sure it was clearly scripted, but I liked the message.
---
Generally its the across the majority of caldari caps bar their fax. Its not as bad as it was years ago where it was armour or bust, but yes they need a look at an some tweaks to their caps a bit of love needed really, but ccp is busy wasting money on a out of game app rather than on the game its self which is part of the reason for the horrid player count right now.
---
terrible allies please intervene
---
i feel like people forget that the dronelands existed for a decade before tapi bailed them out, it's incredible
---
Phoenix, Helios.
---
Eith just t1 abyssals or do you mean eventually doing higher teir ones? I would like to make an alpha account to do it because my main is in a wormhole Corp and it is not safe to do them in wormholes. What suggestions do you have?
---
&gt;Helios
---
The whole Imicus family? Or just the helios? I hate how they look, but I assumed it was just me not liking gallente  ships, not a technical issue
---
day one just t1 abyss can do 20m per hour

I don’t have a dog in any fight in EVE. I will say categorically: anyone who threatens another pilot out of client is an idiot and should be treated as such.

In EVE you get to shoot back. In EVE you get to do stuff that other MMOs would ban you and your immediate family for, for the life time of the universe plus 15 days. So, do that. Find them in the client and shoot them in the face. They know how it works. It’s not a secret. Just keep it in the client, where it belongs.

Outside the client the only civil disagreement is about who will pay for the next round of beers, and if you can’t do that you’re just a sad example of a human being.

About CCP’s handling of conflict... I’ve heard and seen some examples. I’m not impressed with some of their responses and others are just plain dreadful. However, it’s their bouncy castle we’re playing in so... we can only try to talk to them.

what content has the mittani generated really? i'm honestly curious
---
Runs on my S7, so should run on your S8 too

When the Trigs invaded the Sansha forces mostly withdrew out of a sense of self preservation, lorewise.
---
Now instead of 3 incursion foci, there is only 1 focus. The competition between various incursion groups trying to run the same focus created a situation of risky payouts as the group that does it fastest gets ALL the rewards and the possibility exists that your whole fleet could fight for days and end up with a zero payday.

imicus/Helios. The base model just looks like a shitty old camcorder.

Good fishing capsuleers!

Yeah rorq mining in delve is p safe and let's you not pay any attention.

gevlon was right all along

Other than being the king of space, a massive instigator and the fact that he’s being talked about all the time, nothing really *eyeroll*.
---
Nobody else is being talked about so frequently as The Mittani is. You don’t have to like that idea, it happens to be true. We should always be prepared to accept the truth of things, it keeps us grounded in reality.

Ok thanks I'll make an alt after work I like the wormhole I'm in just cant do sites with people often due to my work schedule.
---
I'm not even in Iron Armada... haven't been for nearly two years.

It’s okay, I’ll upvote you &lt;3

Edit: also sorry to see you join goons if this be true, hope there is an ulterior motive :)

ya know, you could have actually given actual examples of what he did in game to be the "top content creator" in your eyes. Instead you decide to show everyone how enamored you are by an e-celeb bureaucrat
