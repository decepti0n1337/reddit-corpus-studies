Come play the last Eve-related poker game in existence, run by 3 former EOH bankers!
---
---
---
That's the first mildly interesting idea I've heard actually
---
goons can't blob highsec with a thousand titans
---

---
we'll probably figure that out somewhere in black rise or lonetrek
---
A little late to this party but one thing thats sort of similar. NPC space should spawn sites from both the pirate faction that owns the space and their enemy pirate faction and/or CONCORD. Currently the way it works is if you have decided to live in say Curse and run Angel Cartel missions than should you decide to do literally any exploration your only choices are to steal or kill your own faction. Instead you could do sites from the Blood Raiders or SARO or whatever. This would let you actually both feel like you were a "loyalist" group and not be choosing between having nothing to do or tanking your standings.
---
i think many people jumping onto the 'reset' wagon are people who have played but not a lot, they feel out classed and want to be able to start off on a more even keel.  i wouldn't mind seeing CCP hiring some economists again and fixing some of that shit but a straight up reset would nuke the game. 
---
 lets be honest, if EVE came out today, it would not succeed. this style of game is just not what people or the market are driven towards right now, the only reason its as strong as it is today is its history.
---
I honestly don't think there's as much difference between that and injectors as people are making out.
---
"But all injector sp is trained in real time by players" 
---
And the anniversary event gave away free SP generated from fuck all. That was one per account too, you just needed to sub to get it. Oh wait, no that was from CCP falcon's 252x10^7 skill farm alts. Forgive me. 
---
The vast majority of SP in injectors is trained by someone running 85 skill farm alts these days. Not "real players" or whatever the argument is.
---
I do think they should give out accelerators and not SP, but acting like there's an immeasurable difference between the two isn't accurate.
---
Kinda obvious.
---
Person who has 2003 Character but hasn't really played is looking for advice to which corp he should join and if his missing corp history is a hindrance
---
Right, I understand that part, but why does it "retcon" your previous totals to try and represent your standing history as linear growth? What do the historical totals even mean if they're modified to look like a linear equation every time I do a mission? Am I to assume that the numbers shown by the game are actually gibberish?
---
0,5%? TTT was a lie.
---
Oh. Ok. Well I’ll watch from the window I guess.
---
ty I added your tldr to my post. Forgot to do it myself.
---
This and no jump clones. No caps. No freighters.
---
Yup, been happening recently on the 64 bit client.
---
Isn't that a Gila or does it just have a similar skin?
---
My advice is that no one cares about how old your character is. If you want to achieve your goals you've gotta play the game. So find out which group fits you best and start learning the game.
---
Oh, I see. 
---
How weirdly entitled to assume that anyone would care.
---
Thank fuck, that thing is hideous.
---
That is what I am trying to find out. Which group fits me best. Like what is the difference between Horde and Brave or Test/Dreddit or any of the other big or even smaller corps? Like where do I find out how they stack against each other or what they offer that is different or the same?
---
That’s funny, considering you follow the exact same process quite a bit
---
No, you are actually brain dead but hey how could you ever realize it.. since your condition and all...
---
They are all gay.
---
Can't kill anyone while cloaked either.
---
not entitled...just thought there might be some value and use for an old account in a game that is built around espionage and intrigue in addition to pew pew fights.
---
nou
---
Make an alpha throw each of them into different corps/alliances,  pay attention to their behaviour / language / actions and when you find that you think will suit you bring the main into the corp
---
Fuck. CCP, if you are hearing this, plz ignore this guy.  The mass of morons in nullsec voted this into existence.
---
how about a meme server where is the early version of eve. back to the oldschool stull with an anual reset
---
Why though? You are making it ugly! It looks fine now.
---
Sure as fuck does
---
 Anyone else getting right click delay?
---
Yes.
---
You’re missing what I’m saying (I’m test too btw... if that helps...)
---
IDK if I should downvote OP because he is such a moron or if I should upvote the post so as many people as possible see your response.  You hit the nail on the head. Good job.
---
The former seems far more useful, since as it stands, the numbers shown are pretty much meaningless. Thank you.
---
in a way yes, for the most part no.
---
while supercaps aren't a thing, the use of dreads and faxs is common in wormhole space, also you can always get rolled out of your home mid fight etc, just from the dynamics of the space.
---
I’m definitely convinced reading comprehension isn’t you’re forte.  I’m saying you want no local cause then you can just show up undectected... murder a bunch of at the keyboard miners/ratters and then disappear again undectected.  
---
You don’t want a fair fight at all you can get that now as is.  Come on out to esoteria.
---
No-one is going to give you free injectors.
---
You can fc in horde right out the gate, not sure what the restrictions are in test and goons.
---
All the downvotes from nullsec players tickles me :D
---
What’s an afk miner? I’m only a week into the game but there’s not much to do when mining. Deploy your drones, pick an asteroid and leave it. What are we supposed to do? 
---
Granted I mine in high sec so maybe I’m missing something. I usually go get a snack or something
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cayr8e/raise_the_tax_get_the_axe/etdr1sp/
---
More reading comprehension issues here.  This isn’t what I said at all.  I said we have huge resource needs that require the mining to occur round the clock.  This no local will shut down a lot of that in all but the most densely populate umbrella zones.  Bye bye small guys.  Bye bye industry requiring more than a group of t1 BS.  
---
Goons will be fine.  Test will be fine.
---
I think it’s kickstand is cute.
---
Imagine what could be achieved if the people who posted long-form essays on game design to r/Eve did anything productive with their life.
---
Estel Arador Corp saving lives and hours for creating jump clones.
---
Darn. Missed opportunity to do no taxation without representation post on July 4th.
---
Under asset safety it says you can move those assets to a citadel, outpost, or NPC station in the same system. Does this mean I can or can not move assets in safety to say an engineering or refinery structure? Or does it have to be a citadel like an Astra, Fort, Keep?

That seems like a pretty scummy thing to do, not gonna lie.
---
About time... Eve has many hull models that just look strange/dated when compared with the most recent stuff they released or redesigned!
---
Here hoping for they too take a look in all other older desighs in game.
---
So screw Panfam screw goons screw test...and why should anyone care about your opinion :)
---
ow
---
Ahhh here we are wanting it to be ez mode.  Don’t want to put in the effort to get kills.    
---
- awww too hard?  Really?   Look harder crybaby. 
---
- vni ratters and miners are content.  Adjust your attitude.  
---
- so?  Go to lesser dense areas?  Don’t go to deleve and expect a Ferox fight.  Maybe... just a thought... pick targets that match your skills.  I recommend branch.
---
Actually, this is really good advice thank you. I will try that.
---
\&gt; As I have said before, it's not CCP's role to "break the blue donut". The '"donut" is human dynamics. The game designers are never going to make a change that breaks up the personal bonds of the Imperium or PanFam or whomever.   
---
I think this is a pretty "I'm not listening or interested in thinking about this." response.   
---
Yeah, it's hard to see the Imperium or PanFam breaking up if all CCP does is tweak mechanics. But if they make major changes? I find it hard to believe that these huge organizations don't have alliances or corps within them that would break away if there was no concrete benefit to staying. At the moment, they offer unlimited PvE with virtually no danger. Being in a coalition is like being in high sec as long as you stay in certain areas. That's huge. Take that away, make capitals much less mobile, get rid of jump bridges, severely curtail jump ranges and massively increase jump fatigue, make capitals unable to light cynos and maybe the ratio of defender to ratter increases to the point where people think they'd be better off in smaller blocs.   
---
It's a thought. I'm sure there are more experienced people with better ideas for how to kill the blue donut, but saying that mechanics have nothing to do with the snoozefest that is nullsec is something that someone who likes the status quo would say.
---
He’s saying there’s a cost to using it.  That it’s penalizing enough.
---
Whoa whoa whoa, I always worked under the impression that it wasn't a single skill lost, but rather the sp difference. So if you were at 20m sp but didn't update your 10m sp clone, you'd lose 10m sp. 
---
I think that was enough to keep my clones updated. Are you sure it was a single skill, man?
---
Then go to other regions.  If you can’t fight goons because your shitty alliance/Corp can’t field anything bigger than domis, that’s not a goons problem... that’s a you problem.
---
LOL.
---
Drifters aren't a bad idea... they're a decent idea executed poorly.
---
Yes, you will appear in Local, however your ship will not be visible in space, nor show up on dscan. The only thing that will uncloak you is a visible object coming within 2500m of your ship.
---
Mission of Mercy is actually pretty easy in a corm. Kite out after the first wave, you only need to kill the moa in the last wave to trigger completion.
---
Blockade is more of a pain in the ass with a gunship because of the tracking disruption.
---
Early bird gets the worm
---
You're probably better off trying to sell your character on the bazaar. I think there is a market for old accounts idk.  If there is, sell it and use the ISK to fund welps on your new toon.
---
he was already caught doing that and they didn't ban him
---
Even if CCP did this, it would be a temporary fix at best. Everyone knows how to minmax for the quickest and most effective result. Just look at the ex serenity players. Objectively they're one of the most efficient groups to gain power simply because they have all the background knowledge, just with new toons.
---
Reprocess it and take in out in Cap Parts
---
Local is the chat channel of the system you are currently in. If you jump into another system your local channel changes to that system. It shows everyone in the system in regular space. It is used for intel by ratters &amp; miners to tell them when an unfriendly enters the system.
---
Nah, your idea is retarded and so are you. Thanks for the suggestion tho, it's valid and appreciated.
---
I dont know whats happening. why dont you fight over TTT if you want decent PvP?
---
Hahahahah, how’s this get here?
---
I’m a former goon. I started in a small group, heard tales of the big sov groups, joined Goons til I understood it and hated it, then left and have been flying with various smaller groups since.
---
In short, local is general chat for your system, just please for the love of god watch out for scammers in jita, if somethings too good to be true in jita BLOCK THE SELLER!
---
I flew out to 0.0 within 30 days of starting, in a crucifier with a damp fit. The 50m sp thing was a myth
---
Yup since the chat systems will be the same as 0.0 you might as well enjoy the same rewards.   
---
Cause fuck ya.  That’s why.
---
You really think anyone on this bad forum is in danger of listening to OUR viewpoint? Is this your first time here?
---
From the comfort of his shitter too.  The nerve.
---
&gt; learning curve comparable to a lot of other MMOs
---
Yeah, tell that to the player retention. I get people like to say Eve is easy just like Dark Souls is easy, but that's just survivorship bias at best.
---
Ohhhh that makes sense. And what's the deal with the NPC that everyone hates?
---
The downvotes are probably just from people embarassed by you being a fucking retard. No biggie tho.
---
Have fun with your even more risk averse gameplay in your krabhole, you're elite sweety. &lt;3
---
Also for the record before you assume, I don't rat or mine. I haven't in years. I'm also not affiliated with any null blob. I just think letting retards like you decide the current path of the game is probably going to end poorly. Anyways.
---
Wormholers btw think everyone should be playing their game cause they’re 1337 and we’re all window licking retarded.  Ignore them.
---
This is called survivorship bias. Did you actually look at player retention numbers?
---
Tbh, you just sound like a shitty hunter. Maybe you should try skilling yourself and getting better?
---
I'll look into that as well. Thank you for the advice.
---
Drifters are like a superNPC that are invading nullsec obliterating the fuck out of PvErs (and also pvpers) and shooting at structures.
---
Considering that Corvettes are free and serve basically the same purpose as Shuttles, when and why would I use a Shuttle instead? It seems less convenient, since with Shuttles you need to actually have them where you intend to board, whereas with a Corvette you can just spawn it wherever you are.
---
You know when you log in, that little window to the bottom left, with all the little tabs for local, corp, rookie help and so on? 
---
That's local. It's a chat window that shows you who's in system and then displays any standings or other status you have set such as war targets, criminal status and so on. 
---
Since it shows standings, it's can be used to tell who is friendly and who isn't in a given system. That system is currently looking at an adjustment for null space (not low or highsec) to make it similar to how it works in wormholes, which has local but no one shows up unless they speak. Basically hunters in eve online want it changed to this so they can easily catch people who are undocked and not cloaked doing things.
---
I have thought about it and I still believe that it is human behavior at the core of the blue donut, not game mechanics. People banding together to protect themselves.
---
You point appears to be "make null sec harder" and that will get people to break into smaller groups. I don't see why people would be better in smaller groups in that scenario.  There is rarely power or strength in *smaller numbers*. 
---
If you goal is more fights, people have to have something to fight over.
---
Could not change around attributes, and you had no idea how important they were. I had 18 perception with +3 implants.
---
If they give rewards for logging in during the local blackout it’s a win win for me.
---
Drifters are bad ass NPC's that originate in Worm holes. They are randomly attacking ships &amp; structures in null. They have a high DPS and can overwhelm subcaps fairly quickly.
---
Or just....have enough people to kill the pilot lighting the cyno?
---
Remove the +Warp Core Strength so they can be tackled just like normal ships
---
geez buddy lighten up
---
Drifters are a far more useful tool for damaging botters than anything else in the game right now. **They also have the added benefit of causing trouble when a mega alliance is spread too far out.**
---
i understand. but when you're curating a list or creating music, you can't appease everyone. its just the way of art (music). i can agree tho with what you said about the selections, homeboy up there picked some pretty space titled/themed songs, even from space related films and themed music pieces. 
---
however, if you were to listen to a curated playlist but still take some artists and they may be new to you, I think that is a win. sure you didn't listen to /all/ of it or maybe even in order, you mentioned skipping until you find a gem. but if you somehow discover a new artist and then go down that rabbit hole (and discover more on your own) thats great and i've shared music with someone. 
---
i guess everyone will look at it different. i am going to try though and try to keep it as themed as possible, by my standards. 
---
i love yelling at children
---
so that's how you became a dick /s
---
Corvettes align slow and warp slow, you’re better off using a pod
---
That is my problem even in frigates.
---
This fit or that fit? This mod or that mod.
---
Until I realized it doesnt really matter, I can fly one until it blows up and then try the next one out.
---
Lol he downvoted you tho
---
You have 100 in fleet. Bring 10 more.... That way 10 more people get on the kill.
---
Add about 5 more clients and now you’re mining sport.  
---
You’re not wrong.  I enjoy it.  I got really bored of watching little drones orbit a rock.  So I just added clients in hulks till I sweat from emptying ore holds every 45 seconds.  Turns out a boosting rorqual can keep 5 hulks humming good!
---
I agree, if you can't defend your structures against other players, you shouldn't have them.
---
But if your enemy is an AI that has no limits or resource constraints, it's a very different question.
---
So people login with multiple accounts and mine?
---
eve online, a game once known for beeing harsh and having a steep learning curve slowly but surely turned into farmville online.
---
but apparently ccp found their balls again and aknowledged that alot of players dont like a riskless/stagnant game. so they decided to try out new stuff to bring in fresh air via ''removing'' local. the strongest inteltool in the game
---
and obviously alot of carebears are reeing hard now
---
Should hold a special place in your heart since it was so ugly they edited your Imicus out of the This is Eve video and replaced it with an Astero. Even CCP was like “this ship is so ugly we can’t use it in our marketing materials”
---
Fuck your rorquals dude, they should not even exist in the first place.
---
If your safe ratting area is smaller than your population requires, what's in it for the population to stick around? If they can't be totally safe with their massive, boring coalition, then what's the point of sticking around? Sure, there's a (very large) core of...I guess patriots is a good word, that will stick around, but people who are just there for the safety won't if they aren't getting it.   
---
Anyway, the changes I mentioned don't just make it harder to defend ratting territory effectively, they make projecting power a lot harder. Nullsec is huge, and there are a small number of centrally positioned coalitions controlling all of it because of how mobile their caps are. Current mechanics encourage people who don't otherwise give a shit about the Imperium or PamFam to stick around because A) they're guaranteed safe PvE and B) they have no other option. If you aren't signed up with the big boys they'll kill you, wherever you are, because they can have their whole cap fleet at your door regardless of how far you are very quickly.   
---
Change those two things and see if nullsec doesn't get more interesting.
---
Can confirm
---
Eve was dying
---
Eve is dying
---
God all I hear you doing is bitching and whining.  Maybe fight similarly sized groups?  Don’t stroll into impass right under a super umbrella?  
---
These aren’t Brave/eve/null problems.  This all a you problem.
---
We occupy nine constellations in Delve. How much farther should we concentrate? Also, how far should we spread out? I hear tell that we are too concentrated and we need to spread out, in order to dilute the power of our supercapital umbrella.
---
Imagine if we'd do anything productive with our lives instead of playing EVE.
---
Dunk this isn’t a problem with you man.  Nothing will be fine until all the nul blocks are reset.
---
Both are wrong.
---
I think its because in general you can tend to do less with T1 stuff nowadays
---
Fuck, even dreads seem pretty worthless.
---
A vni easily breaks 60m/hr. Ess+faction spawns+escalations add up.
---
Blackout is a step in a better direction, but Eve is still in a state I'm not too happy about.
---
Eight years is a big part of my life. Still no regrets -- in that time I've made friends and done fun shit.
---
Here is the unreasonable irrational thinking person in the wild.  Unable to carry a respectful conversation.  Unable to see points of view differing of his own.  Pure unfiltered rage hate towards a group of people who enjoy a game play and space mechanics that which he does not.  So it’s a complete fuck you to all.
---
Carry on dbag
---
There where no API verified killboards back then, only player run ones.
---
Maybe fight them outside this?  Maybe instead ccp should incentivize reasons to stray out of it and not turtle up under.
---
its still like wow learning curve if you join a large bloc, and will still be easy because goons will get around this no local, meanwhile pubbies will be butt mad when it doesn't work for them and makes there life worse :)
---
spoilers: It won't.
---
F1 to F3 control your fighters actions, however if you select your ship (clicking on it, opening inventory, etc..) then it will also activate your ship modules.
---
NSA/Cyno are extremely bad to have on the F1 to F3 positions as you may accidentally activate them.
---
In general when I am flying a carrier/super, I just keep the entire first row of modules clear to be safe.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You also want to pay attention to whether your ship or your fighters are selecting when performing different actions. Approach/orbit commands can either go to your ship or fighters depending on what is selected, accidentally breaking align can be very bad, moving fighters away from their intended target can also be bad.
---
ok
---
&gt;Didn't become the trade hub of eve because it was most optimally located
---
Actually it became the optimal tradehub of eve after yulai died down because caldari has always been the most populated highsec space and jita sits on the border of 3 caldari regions.
---
Also your point about lowest taxes or a stable and secure place are pretty moot since all NPC stations share the same tax and 'stability'.
---
I was using an arty Thrasher.  Had to warp-out many times in deep structure.
---
There are no wave triggers.  All the ships spawn on a timer.
---
Getting close enough to destroy anything, and not dying doing it, was the biggest problem.
---
&gt; smart move
---
aka, skill.
---
No you provide reasons to stray outside the umbrella.  
---
What’s wrong if null sec in space the sov alliances install ihubs that allow instant local (just the way it is now) and some of this security then comes at a cost in terms of production capacity (won’t spawn a colossal for instance).   Or that virgin fields without ihubs and that have low jump counts spawn more random very rich resource patches that incentivize groups to stray?  Like lighting a cyno would cause them to despawn immediately.
---
As a guy that been more off from eve that on for the last couple of years and never cared about space politics i really want to know......
---
 Is getting into the "goons" a thing? i kinda wanna try the big block stuff (played WH and solo in Hi-sec trading and industry) and i wanted to know if its possible to find a manufacturing specialized corp in there to learn some stuff and enjoy the perks of beeing on the big boys side for once. Or am i just gonna get scammed or something... 
---
over the years iv heard u get scammed, that u need to be a part of the something awfull forum for ages....
---
since tbh i never cared much at this point if more myth and legend that runs in my head.... but since im thinking or resubbing... never hurts to know right?
---
thanks for the heads up!
---
Its wild how consistently wrong you are
---
Blue
---
The learning curve is not as steep anymore imo, but still steep. 
---
The one thing that didn't change is the complexity and sheer amount of things you can learn and know. You never know everything. The game is not 100% solved itself even.
---
You could say the curve is flatter, but it still rises for a lot longer than other games. You learn new things after years of playing, not sure about other games there.
---
Genuinely made me laugh out loud. :D
---
That's why the corm makes it easy. burn off at start, frag the frigates to keep DPS down. Wait till last wave, kill cruiser, adios
---
It was an amazing game. I'm old as fuck though.
---
Oops, I only picked up the habit in Apocrypha
---
&gt; Maybe fight similarly sized groups?
---
They don't exist in nullsec.
---
The tutorial was useless but also many other systems were more difficult to navigate, not to mention the average wallet was MANY times smaller then now but the average item price wasn't much cheaper either which mean loss also meant a lot more. Times have changed, and EvE is as easy as ever. All their changes have added for EvE to be more work along with more complicated, it hasn't gotten "harder" in years.
---
2006 - wow what a cool niche hardcore game
---
2009 - nice streamlined optimizations
---
2012 - this is the peak

2013 - ok let's see how phoebe plays out

2016 - uhg, going down hill
---
2018 - injectors, fozziesov, citadel trifecta of stupidity
---
2019 - game is dead
---
2019.7.5 - no local? they might actually want to fix the game
---
Mind you the last time I did it, destroyers were very different ships.
---
The Cormorant had nowhere near the range it does now.  They were horrible ships back then.
---
Cool
---
Accurate
---
YEP I've been dreaming of this day for 4 years

In groups like goona a couple guys like kunmi will do it for you. So your passive aggressive asshole can continue cherry picking best isk per hour activity inatead of going back to hi sec.
---
Incursion public channel in game have all your info.
---
Happens all the time to me. Game has been performing horribly since the drifter event.
---
Maybe you’ve outgrown it and need to leave.
---
Runs perfect using steam and proton db. Easy as opt into proton and install game.
---
Damm i thought free stuff...nope none here. 🤨
---
Daddy wants to be able to watch NPC Delve
---
But CCP said no no no
---
hurr hurr git it guyz cause it says goons LUL
---
Join a major alliance. Any will do and it will greatly increase your gameplay experience
---
Oh I did, I took 3-years off. Nothing else is out there that compares. So I will spend my energy here continuing to argue for the game play that I believe will continue to help the game grow rather than the monstrosity we see today. We used to have player counts of 35-40k on the weekends in a pre-alpha pre-mass botting world. Today we see 25k on the weekend. Something is wrong.
---
I think their whole idea of radical departure from concentric hull designs was good intentioned, but ultimately flawed.  Humans at their core (98%-ish of ‘em anyway) are fundamentally attracted to concentric shapes and geometric designs. While a bare few of the old EVE ship designs are indeed iconic, most of them made me wonder what the hell they were smoking in Iceland.  
---
I can’t recall much they ever even NEEDED to do with the Amarrian ships; they are beautiful specimens. 
---
The poor Caldari were cursed with some of the weirdest looking spiky-lop sided monstrosities ever. I was constantly afraid I’d get suspect status just cuz someone ran into my Raven comms spike. Thank you CCP for fixing that. 
---
Now the Gallente. Let’s face it. Some are just so damn cute you can’t help but love them, and God protect anyone who tries to monkey with it. They have that authentic Art Decco air; they remind me of the futuristic looking car ads from the 1950’s advertising burger joints on Route 66. Having said that, there are a couple that need some love , Hilmar. One looks like a flying hearing aid, the other a squirrel turd with a DISH TV antenna on it. 
---
Now. Brace yourself. In the matchless and holy name of Bob, giver of wormholes, I ask you to immediately execute the person who was ever allowed to design the Minmatar ships. I mean, I get it. With fully half their people still in slavery, the Minmatar weren’t especially concerned with appearances, merely brutal firepower. And this, they certainly achieved.  I even get the “In Rust We Trust” motto (as some might not know, the Minmatar ships aren’t *really* rusty. It just comes from the native chemistry of the steel they use in most corners of their nuclear matter-laden empire.  But to slap a nuclear reactor in a box; 8 monstrous projectile batteries of the most ancient technology in another box, randomly slap on brown solar energy collecting arrays, and then a mile-long catwalk connecting to a small crew and command area, as far away as possible from the nuclear reactor. 
---
Come on. Fix this shit.
---
That’s why I feel exploration is a really good starting point, teaches you the importance of constantly monitoring your environment/system you’re in, proper overview settings, use of bookmarks, ship alignment and how to use the system/universe map while having to cross all of the different types of space. 
---
Being at the bottom of the pvp food chain requires a certain amount of vigilance.
---
Join RvB! The fire is rising!
---
&gt; That it’s penalizing enough.
---
and I am disagreeing with him (Though I think he was baiting)
---
Eve will always be dying
---
Yeah no your corp is shit and he'll just quit
---
Yes! I got tackled today fucking around with right click trying to bring it up. Eventually had to put people and places back on screen so I could reliably warp to safe.
---
Same on 32 bit client
---
Lost a covops to it today. It's not just right click but many operations that cause my client to sit there and think about it for several seconds.
---
Well Eve was quite different 15 years ago, but wow what a game..I ate and drank it.
---
Now....the game is phenomenal and better....BUT
---
If you want the full experience you need to go to one of the "Fat Cats" and on there terms.
---
This blackout thing might be the ticket....without a big billboard on my ass..I might be able to explore a little.
---
These "Fat Cats" only exist and have their numbers because players don't have a choice if they want the whole Eve experience.  They need to fix this somehow. and hopefully this is what they have in mind.
---
and I can write another page on how joining the conglomerates is not that easy..but i won't
---
It is just a guess what CCP might have done.  I'm too lazy to do the math to confirm, but it would explain why you are seeing a change.
---
Seems applicable:

---
The gaming world changed man.  Those issues you list there aren’t gonna be fixed by local chat lol.  You gotta look at the whole game man. 
---
If you wanna see material player count growth, organic growth not beemans 50th injected rorqual alt, then the other areas of space need to be looked at too.  With the same fervent attitude.  Why isnt lowsec/high sec looked at?  Why not buff some of the benefits of low sec?  Maybe these smaller null groups would entertain low sec if it was closer in benefits.
---
&gt;Ccp should celebrate this wondrous occasion by bringing back our beloved jukebox!
---
You have my vote!
---
Have been playing almost a week. Been in low sec FW blowing up tristana over and over.  Tried out a scram/dampen kitty maulus fit. Got a solo kill 5 minutes after undocking.
---
The risk is what makes the game fun.
---
Honestly guys you can lose the kickstand altogether
---
Hey, my alliance is on Youtube!
---
Nice video. Appreciate the shoutout but more importantly the content. Really glad to see these, I greatly enjoyed the JinTalks series back when you were covering the southeastern conflict with Stainfraggin vs Stain/Goons, and the subsequent conflicts.
---
Keep it up!
---
why would i give it time? there is no insurance nerf nor is there one pending on sisi.
---
prices get fucked up massively every sisi mirror. don't be a dumb.
---
Ok well if my wife suddenly gets cancer or is in a car wreck (god forbid) and I want to come back when my life has settled down from that I’m gonna be fairly receptive to being able to pay a fee to pull my shit out of a cooler and not have to start at zero.  Asset safety needs a tweak not a redo.  It needs to trigger on login/subscription times and not just be immediate (exploitable).
---
I agree with what you're saying here.
---
&gt; Those issues you list there aren’t gonna be fixed by local chat lol.
---
I know this, what I listed in my reply is a retort to a null sov guy complaining about ONE thing that MAY be of use to hunters for once.
---
&gt; Why isnt lowsec/high sec looked at?
---
I believe that we need a completely revamped NPE that really gives players a clear idea of what avenues they can take, and let highsec be that learning ground. Lowsec is well over due for a revamp of Faction Warfare, and some other material assets to fight over (like the good days of having moon mining POS's). 
---
The game needs a massive change, but unfortunately CCP moves at a snails pace. This game has so much potential to go well into its third decade but things need to change.
---
Same
---
I prefer the old one to this tho
---
Pulse Paladin, you don't need both a grappler and a web, just Grappler/MJD/Battery/Scram to stop a frigate at 10km and get it under your tracking speed. You volley things off the field and GTFO.
---
Can absolutely waste a small gang that didn't bring hard counters. Also great with very minimal support, such as a jammer for long range scrams or a Rapier with webs and a point to further fuck over nano shit.
---
MWD in general is not super userful on Marauders except for maybe Vargur.
---
Not until we nerf asset safety and remove SP injection.
---
Jesus loves Goons. 
---
No really. Stop laughing!
---
But to be perfectly fair, there is no reason why Bastion should prevent remote reps any more. Considering the capital proliferation there is nothing wrong with a Marauder fleet that can hunker down and smash T1 battleship fleets since Bastion is just not going to stop you from getting volleyed off the field by supercaps whether or not you bring remote reps.
---
&gt; The 50m sp thing was a myth
---
I ran into is more than once. You started before people had accumulated 50M though right? I didn't get in until 2008 and I definitely saw skill minimums in the tens of millions of SP.
---
Not true. Suitonia has an entire YouTube channel dedicated on spreading the fact that Eve is Easy
---
&gt; many other systems were more difficult to navigat
---
Probing used to be challenging. Now the sigs are so anxious to be found, they're yelling "Marco!" to let you know where to look for them.
---
Marauders don't need fixing, they're fully capable pvp boats as they are now - just stop treating them like some kind of mini-dreads they aren't. It was talked over and over, for how to make great use of them, there's old but still valid thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/64jxtb/a_rebuttal_to_the_recent_fix_marauders_threads/
---
If you want free cyno inhibition and cap-free environment, pvp in deadspace pockets and wait for targets to fly to you. Marauder is tasty, shiny target, they will come.
---
Can we start banning people just because they mention the word "blackout"?
---
I agree on most points, but some like number of jumps or logging a person who docked or broadcast, would be reasonable
---
That wonderful curve still applies, how many mmo’s teach players 1) don’t fly what you can’t afford to lose, and 2) never trust anyone.
---
Join our in-game public chat "Brand Newbros" and have a chat with some of the people there, see if it interests you. FCing in BNB is fairly easy. You just need to get people to join your fleet. FCing for TEST is harder.
---
Like high sec needs to be safer.  End the code/ganking bullshit.  Shrink it down in space.  Eliminate moon mining.  You learn mechanics, join a Corp.  meet people.  Etc.  it’s safe.  It sucks but it’s safe.  
---
Make low sec the fucking shit fest.  All your small gangs none of the super umbrella.  No titans/supers period.  Moon mining.  Let corps hold a shot at a smaller sized tcu that can spawn some anoms.  Maybe factor in a faction warfare angle somehow.  Idk.  The answer to a lot of the eve problems in 2019 are not glass null but buff low sec instead. 
---
Null is what it is.  Big ships.  Big swaths of sov.  Jump Bridges.  Huge fleet engagements.  The best run alliances will thrive and grow (and yes blue donut, curb stomp small gangs, etc).

There didn't even used to be probes :( I miss leaving ships in safespots ;p
---
Inb4 the era of ratting marauders is upon us
---
So get some kills and talk in local from time to time. I plan to hunt and take payments to leave people alone. Worked before although the targets aren't as juicy.
---
I tried to play Eve. I wanted to like it so bad. The learning curve was too much. Thinking about playing the game all day just to come home and get stuck after 5 minutes trying to google what to do killed it.
---
Same here, seems I get stuttering/long frame times when using interval one on borderless window mode. Full screen works fine, but then when I try to move my mouse to another monitor, the client minimizes so I have to use window mode. 
---
Interval immediate works a bit better, but the problem is still there, and then FPS/GPU utilization is too high when docked causing lots of noise and heat.
---
Depends on the group, and most large groups in 2008 had these rules
---
When I first started (end of 2009) I was amazed at the very concept of the game and thankful for the people that have created it, and really enjoyed it; this lasted some time, even for years that I couldn't play do to RL restrictions but kept reading everything I could about EVE. Then around 2 or 3 years ago that feeling started slowly turning into disappointment after each poorly executed decision regarding the future road... all to culminate in a disastrous 2018 when some of the most catastrophic modifications to the game where either implemented or came to their full consecuence (injectors, rorqual mining, unrestricted structures with poorly designed mechanics, instanced PVE and all that shit most people here already know about). 
---
Now? I was already slowly starting to play again (thanks Jin'taan and everyone else involved for doing the SSI2) after a six months hiatus (mostly based on outright disappointment and boredom with the game and CCP) and now I'm afraid to admit that I'm feeling a little excited and hopeful, since even if there are some doubts and fears regarding the Drifters and the incoming Blackout, those seem like signs that CCP is trying to adress the problems that are slowly but surely stagnating this game, and maybe (hopefuly) come back to the ruthless roots that made me fall in love with this game.
---
&gt;google what to do killed it.
---
Its called undocking.
---
Wasn't there another post about the blackout where you could have posted this as a comment?
---
All major groups required certain SP, and a good history to join. First tried eve in 08, and many larger alliances demanded a history, and good KB first. Yes, goons back then allowed low skill people in- bit you had to come from their stock (SA.com). 
---
  So yes, there definitely was a time where an SP requirement was involved in null recruitment, I would know as I was playing at the time.
---
It wasn’t 50mill sp lol. Thats just not true. There are more groups in this game than goons.
---
This Leshak does not appear to be shooting a super...
---
PL/BoB off the top of my head. Others with 20mil were NC, Nulli, ANZA (if you wanted into null), etc. Shit changed when groups like dreddit, BRAVE, then later HORDE rolled in. There may have been small corps out there, but I'm talking sov holding alliances

I'm getting right-click issues sporadically on the 32-bit client as well for about the last week.
---
3-4 clients open, about 25% of the time 1-3 of them will be having right-click issues, but never all 4 at once so far.
---
?
---
The only thing that keeps Marauders from being used in PVP is their pice, also the Kronos needs -1 low, +1 mid
---
I actually don't see much of an issue with paying ships off. Even a Rattlesnake will pay itself off running havens as they are now after 2-3 days max. An Ishtar maybe one day tops if they pay attention.
---
For the most part null is going to continue to be as empty as it has ever been, I think.
---
Now I'm out of the loop. Reset? Like Drifters resetting eve? 
---
Fucking lol.
---
So when you get really drunk and can't remember anything, whats that called again?
---
I dont think you really need to know Eve politics to join a group other than trying to find "the good guys"
---
Protip: That's always whoever you're applying to and the bad guys are everyone else.
---
dreddit, pandemic horde, karmafleet, brave newbies are some of the bigger of the new player friendly groups
---
Eve has sound?
---
I had the issue with the 32 bit client as well. So it does not seem to be an issue with the 64 bit client only.
---
A great time.
---
Subpar shitpost...didn’t even use a tilde smh
---
You should post this to the normal forums to signal boost.
---
First as has been said, no one will give you injectors.
---
Other than that, I would recommend Eve Uni as a great place to learn and figure things out.
---
Pair of Nids, so you were input broadcasting.
---
I think most people were around 70ish million when I started, but groups like IAC, KOS, BRUCE, a few others would take on most people
---
ur dum lol
---
He is correct, it was 20m or 50m.  T2 Tank was required, AWU 5 was a common requirement.  T2 Guns were often required (50m corps).
---
To be honest Eve is not the best solo game. You could try to find a good group to play with and make an alt for solo isk making.
---
We give them too much shit
---
Oh come on, lets not pretend the gates weren't changed to enable jita.
---
Or maybe if bastion makes your marauder not lockable by capitals?
---
Lets go back to 2008 with no nullification, no wormholes, and old probes.
---
Hunters had skill back then.  Now they are glorified npc hunters.
---
You spam warp because if your ship dies, target lock breaks, and the point breaks...so you have to gtfo.
---
A scram will also cancel a warp...so theoretically this could only happen if alpha'd, and without a point.
---
I'm not actually sure the mechanic of continuing into warp if dead without a point on you though; would need testing.
---
The Reset is the QAnon of Eve Online.
---
Austin BBQ is worth hate crashing
---
There's a program linked in several goon foeuma and is used in other alliances that reads the logs output by the game to check for new arrivals. I think it's called taco or something. Either way, put an alt in a strategic spot, even an alpha, and bam. Perfect Intel on who is entering your area.
---
lol in 2008 I was roaming in a 4-5km/s vagabond soloing Ravens under the largest military forces in the game. I'm game for that era again :)
---
Praying to the porcelain goddess.
---
Pandas are delicious
---
a reset doesnt mean like..a wipe. although maybe in context whatever they were talking about does.
---
a reset is more like an overhaul that changes the direction of the game. Imagine a wittling down and splintering of the huge alliances. What if the biggest powers were half the size of the current empires and there were more alliances creating more content across EvE?
---
I truly miss that game. Port battles were amazing.
---
Reddit?
---
that
---
I get the mid fight thing, but is that more common or is rolling it yourself to critical so people don't chance it. The ability to move your system location to avoid dangerous links seems very beneficial.
---
RIP Eve Classic
---
i started 5 years ago and remember all of that aside from no warp to 0 and no wormholes. 
---
really makes me realize how far the game has come since then. people shit themselves all they want about how bad new sov mechanics are. old sov mechanic were shit too, but with the new system, alliances are encouraged to bring in more people and to allow low SP players, which is AWESOME for null. training new players is great for warming the bittervet heart and more people means more soft targets to hit on a roam.
---
Yeah, it was one level of your highest skills. You thankfully didn't lose all that SP.
---
 dishonor on you, dishonor on your cow, and dishonor on your alliance.

---
This is what we in the profession refer to as a joke.
---
(Also, they didn't ban him because he wasn't actually breaking the rules.)
---
Why would you split your player base into two fragmented places unless forced to?
---
hyuk
---
the difference is that 15s is 1/3 -if that- of a frigate engagement, and nobody in their right mind would use adc in afs when long term grid engagements are expected
---
cloaky camping currently: the guy just sits there all day afk and zeros all mining and ratting, zero effort or risk for a relatively big reward
---
cloaky camping with no local: if the camper does not make his presence known constantly his presence is worthless to stop adm activities. he must interact with the game. whether he will ambush someone or be a coward is up to him.
---
Actually no cloaky camping doesnt remajn the same, you do realize the current interation of sov usually starts with region wide camping to "soften" a target. 
---
Most times with only a few kills to start it off then cruise by leting your presence be a deterrent to ratting or mining. 
---
Now only activing hunting will grind a region. 
---
I am not opposed to only active means success, but it definitely has changed the current meta. Dont joke yourself on that.
---
I'm not sure we played the same game. PotBS was a dumpster fire. It was probably my biggest let down in gaming untill Fallout 76.
---
That applies to you too, right?
---
CYNO
---
APPLY DIRECTLY TO THE FOREHEAD
---
MWD is super useful on marauders. Whether it's burning back to a gate, keeping that ship in point range for just a little longer, or giving you a little more time to blap something before it catches up to you, I almost never take off the MWD. I always have the MJD and heavy cap booster fit. I usually put a long point or sebo in that 4th mid.  I usually run with strong drop booster. 
---
A couple of weeks ago, I went after an 8 man wh assault frigate/cmd dessy gang that turned out to be a 20 man gang with a little logi and I just couldn't kill anything. Lasted about 15 minutes before I gave up and had some people come help. I'll give the grappler a try. I have a nice domination grappler in my container of modules for the Paladin collection.

---
It's just amusing at this point.
---
Ok that band is awesome. Thanks for introducing me!
---
Have you checked the EVE store?
---
Because that's where they'd be if CCP didn't hate money
---
Roaming might take a bit longer since you won't know a system is empty and warp straight to the next gate. Going to have to warp around and dscan to find stuff or risk missing out.
---
I'm all for it though, there's definitely negatives but the positives outweigh them, IMO.

Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
I dunno, I only have fond memories of it. I think it was the very first MMO I ever played, but if I had played WOW or EvE before it, I probably wouldn't have liked it.
---
Just as folks are upset about CCP forcing pve on them via the drifters others are upset about pvp being forced on them.  Or as others have said “if I wanted no local I would be living in a wormhole”.
---
Only low IQ pvp players complain about it being too hard to hunt and shoot prey.  They want to be spoon fed content.  
---
Good luck hunting bots that are not going to undock or afk ratters that will now be on guard or massive fleets of multiboxing mining toons where you might catch a few low value ships that were too slow.  
---
And mainly just wanted to say Eve is not black and white in regards to play style.  Not just pvp does not equal just krabbers.  Or is your IQ too low to understand that?
---
I can't wait for you to get vonholed like a retard
---
If the drifters are going to stay, subcap ratting will be a thing of a past. We will see how it plays out, because now everything is in motion, and there's nothing certain about them.
---
You are right about the null block getting even more compact. I think it's safe to assume that for example, all of Legacy could fit inside one super cap umbrella. Why spread around when it doesn't improve the reward, but it is less safe than keeping all together? 
---
Denser the region, better the intel, and there will intel bunnies on all crucial gates.
---
*looks up from the iceland customs enforcement, trying to import a trebuche to force CCP to release models*
---
I just took a new alt through the tutorial yesterday. It blows my mind how much is given to you in the first hours of the game. So many of the skills are trained up by default, what's the point of even having them as skills? I wanted to buy some +3 implants to get my training going right away and thought, "I hope I have enough skill to use an implant." The ones I bought required Science IV, so I thought, surely it's going to take me a couple days. Nope. I had Science IV already, without even doing anything. WTF is the point of that?
---
I was expecting it to be bashing so highsec structures.
---
"having pvp forced on them"  
---
uhhh hi this is eve online. You know that's the point of the game right? PvP. It's not some "side optional thing." It's THE thing the game is based around.  
---
  
---
Krabs will now have fleets on stand by to fight and defend them? What's the downside? Good. I can't wait.
---
Got rid of the PvP tournament.  Guess that makes me the reigning champ still eh? &lt;|:^)
---
Welp some group is going to get all their stuff stolen and be forced to disband.
---
the citadels to die belonged to small group nobodies...
---
Once you're in the corp, the forums show upcoming events along with up-to-date doctrines for whatever activity is being planned.
---
 
---
Otherwise, one can simply ask in the questions channel and look for solid looking builds from experienced players. I fit the ship that got my first solo PvP kill with advice from a uni member in chat.
---
This isnt going to stop big corporations / alliances from running 3rd party bots.
---
Scrape the data from a screen of stacked windows that show only overlay.  Program the system name.  Set them up on in gates to dead end systems / high priority routs.
---
Bot pings discord with player name,  killboard link, system name 
---
It's not as if this shit isnt already happening.
---
Their strengths are their bonds and their out of game logistics. No reset, of any kind, would have any long-term effect on these organizations.
---
there are multiple new bro groups that will take you in even as a week one player in null. Hell goonswarm even has a program to give you all the starter skillbooks you should train for free when you join. It will be harder to live in null then highsec as a brand new bro, but there is no reason you can't do it if you really want too.
---
I don’t get the whole I hate Indy players thing.  Without Indy players you would not have a ship to fly around in.  You missed the part of the game being based on more then pvp.  Or there would be no rats or mining ships or structures made just for industrial uses.  
---
If THE only thing the game was based on then why have those things.  The market could just be seeded with all the pvp related ships and modules and you would earn isk just killing other players.  No Indy, no exploration, no pve.  But then it would not be Eve would it?
---
Perfect Intel with no risk is literally the definition of near bots
---
What other similarly-sized groups are there that aren't megablocs? It's directly because of things like super umbrellas and buffer zones/renter space that there's no one else to fight and everyone just consolidates.
---
carpenter brut is love, carpenter brut is life &lt;3
---
Duh we need to consolidate, but in a spread out fashion.  We also need to HTFU, get gud, and adapt or die.
---
I've been having a lot of fun finding NPC mining operations and blowing up their haulers. Get some skins, some decently valuable mining mods or BPC.

---
Will never stop subbing. As I earn more so will CCP.
---
Eve has a popular 3rd party killboard and it's going to dispel any enigma you might think you have going on with an old character. Most people without API access to the character are probably going to either assume it was sold, an old market character, or someone coming back on an extremely old account.
---
No, like seriously, rorqs should not exist as direct mining ships.
---
A portion of Eve players are risk averse.  Removing local will not make those players any less averse to risk.  Instead of undocking in spite there not being local, they will move to other less risky PVE activities.  End result less players to PVP in NS.  Having said that, there are a good number of NS inhabitants, including myself, who are looking forward to the blackout for various reasons.
---
what was their reason for removing the jukebox?  
---
I remember some big stink about it
---
The amount of stuff. Most games have things designed to aim you to at least something functional, where stuff that youd naturally think would work together, does.
---
Eve doesnt do that. In eve all things just kinda exist, and you have to figure out what works by yourself/mates. This is doubly so if you are interested in nullsec/wh
---
I was getting it, but only on my laptop. I thought it was just my wifi being shit, tbh.
---
not had any issues on my wired desktop.
---
you can pinpoint the exact time CCP seagull was made game director on this timeline (hint its just after Phoebe, and her vision for 'letting players build bigger sandcastles' was the impetus for the changes that ultimately ruined eve)
---
I'll be honest.
---
other than the thrasher concept art, this is the only other ship i've looked at and gone "this is garbage, please don't"
---
\&gt; Whether it's burning back to a gate, 
---
You shouldn't be gatebouncing in a Battleship mid-combat, and you'll never make it anyway. Out of combat there are few situations where you would need to gatebounce, except giving chase, and that's not what Battleships are for. You are bait. Your fights come to you.
---
\&gt; keeping that ship in point range for just a little longer 
---
Anything you grapple/scram, as a rule, will stay in scram range until you or target die, you get ECMed (unlikely in bastion) or they burn out because they brought an afterburner. Here is the thing though, you will always be scrammable when fighting people up close and trying to grapple them, so you are not going to use that MWD to close range in combat. Most of the time you won't even be able to turn it on.
---
\&gt; or giving you a little more time to blap something before it catches up to you 
---
Not only is that a completely wrong mindset for flying a battleship, generally you absolutely *want* things to catch up to you. How else are they going to get grappled and scrammed? Why would you delay that? What if they take a chunk of damage and decide to peace out? What are you going to do, *chase them down*?
---
\&gt; A couple of weeks ago, I went after an 8 man wh assault frigate/cmd dessy gang that turned out to be a 20 man gang with a little logi and I just couldn't kill anything 
---
That's because you probably had an MWD on and tried to chase down orbiting frigs with it. What you want to do is let them get close for a scram by baiting them with an MJD while acting like a startled ratter (maybe sit in Bastion for a while), then grab the most expensive thing (probably a command dessie) that is in scram/grapple range, burn it down, and rinse/repeat until they get what's happening and bail. Done right you can easily kill 3 or 4 ships before they really understand what the fuck is going on, especially if you do it right and let them chew through your armor into hull for a bit and act like your reps are failing. Cycle them once in a while.
---
So this is Endgame for logistics also?
---
I don't hate "indy players." I hate risk adverse farmsville krabs whose very presence have pussified the game into it's current form. Thankfully/hopefully CCP will rectify that mistake with these changes. Trust me no matter how hard industry or krabbing gets, someone will do it. The less people do it the more valuable those things become. Supply and demand.
---
tbh why don't they take the opportunity to gank the hunters that will rush in to try to kill them. Set up traps for days.  
---
And you miss the point. Hunters/pvpers will fight each other just as fast as krabs. If krabs aren't there anymore, pvp gangs will just run into each other and fight. Win/win.

Also you can have a look at http://coalitionsin.space/

That website tells you which alliance is in a coalition with who.
---
when i started: who? oh, they make this game? cool
---
now: it's clear they haven't got a fucking clue and eve was a fluke, i hope lady luck keeps smiling because that's all that's pulling them through.
---
Depends where you live.
---
I've always been under the impression they're fairly similar so it's more a matter of convenience.
---
as some one who has been to a few fanfests, if you've never been to either - it's definitely worth the trip, especially if you extend it a few days and do some of the touristy stuff while you're there. iceland is a beautiful country, never been to vegas myself though.
---
A question about anti-gank shield tank. I'm curious if it's even necessary to bother with EM and Explosive tank. It seems the vast majority of gank fits (catalyst and vexor) use pretty much only kinetic and thermal damage, is there any specific reason why I should tank for anything else? Aside from as a contingency plan for rare situations?
---
ecm is irrelevant for drones now, you can always lock whoever jams you
---

---
Those risk averse "krabs" who do everything they can to avoid PVP, it is just their play style.  
---
If hunters/pvpers fight each other it won't be any different that it is now?  I cannot be denied that there are portion of hunters/pvpers that look for soft juicy targets rather than engaging something that can fight back.
---
the cost of sale is 1000 PLEX from memory or $20.
---
you might find a new account also gets a significant enough boost to SP (starting skills and recruiting bonus) to make the new account superior.

Yes, the game is still hard to grasp for new players.

I'm not sure how your point is meant to be applied to what I said. Care to explain more? Or did you mean to reply to someone else?

Yes, it does.

Ships like vargur are very good in theory but in reality not that great tbh
---
I own vargur myself and I know l33t pvper who used vargur 4fun, but whole impression was ‘not worth’.
---
Vargur is good when you can mjd like crazy and everyone in grid wants to approach F1 you, but ppl got smart recently, even horde newbeans don’t mindlessly chase you, so Leshak and drek is just better overall.
---
I saw some successful marauder pvp at amamake and some youtube, but anyway that was very very rare case so I think it’s kinda safe to say to buff marauders, even they are decent on paper.
---
At least please give some love to kronos...
---
Until you have nothing left to shoot with.  If you mean risk adverse because there are intel channels and being aware of your surroundings that’s just playing smart.  If they were risk adverse they would be in high sec.  I am arguing because you devalue a good half of the player base and what they enjoy doing.  
---
You have a right to your opinions and they have a right to theirs.  They are just as much a player of the game as you are.  Calling them dumb is just silly salt because you can’t catch them.

\^ this comment is from someone who never spent 25bil on a super + fit

The PVE focused players are going to pitch a fit for a couple of weeks after it starts. Some will unsub, many won't undock, and they'll point to every negative statistic or anecdote they can to prove that it's a terrible idea.
---
But, reality is that Eve is addictive, and it's more profitable to feed the occasional ship than to stay docked and safe. Eventually most will accept the situation and get back to business. The transition will be awkward for a bit, which will piss them off more, but eventually they'll come up with ways to mitigate how much they feed. And the world moves on, with slightly more explosions.
---
it still boggles me that the item looses it's data tag, if it were the same UUID and the tag using that UUID to render the tag
---
then why should changing an field related to the user have an effect on the item?!
---
this is why i was wondering if it is just a new account (UUID wise) copied over with all skills, and variables and ingame items got changed their UUID reference (i know it sounds awefull to do it this way but i would understand since the database has grown ever so long as the game exists and it is pretty much plausible to be unable to change the name field if the original DB structure was not aware of it being changeable ... tl;dr; legacy database code)

Take this with a grain of salt since I haven’t bought chars before, but I think generally its 1b per 1mil SP after 5m sp. More if its a specialised char. So somewhere between 35 - 40 bil I would guess. Grain of salt though...

I'm happy that CCP is trying to bring people back. What I fear, is that they have chosen and shock treatment on already weakened patient.

Also I don't necessarily agree with your statement on Everything being addictive. To be honest, I think people are more drawn to in game communities that to game itself. Game is more of catalyst of all exiting moments that community shares. We will see if all of this will be a catalyst to content creation.

They do price checks on there too, I would look at past toon sales that have skills on par with yours, get an average and go with that. When giving it a title go with the best attributes (Perfect Paladin Marauders V, Level 5 mission beast or something along those lines). Its pretty focused with little waste you did a good job training.
---
Set your ground price at the cost of the large skill injectors plus plex transfer (yes you can still use plex to do transfer they just made it a bit trickier)  you would get if you just decided to sell the skills. Be sure to state that in your ad when people start haggling. The rest depends on how much profit you want to make above your skill injector price and if its reasonable or you can find a seller that agrees to the price, you have a sale.
---
Here are some past Marauder sales, based on past sales 30 to 50 bil is gonna be your range

KF member here. I agree with nearly everything in this post. Only corrections I'd have is scamming is forbidden in KF and our public channel in game is taken pretty seriously by the recruitment team to keep it from being shit.
---
We do also have a very active leadership team that is directly involved with the members of the corp. Comms are usually active even in off timezone. Get involved and you'll find engaging people and as part of a PvP corp, you won't starve for action.

I can honestly say in 25 years of dealing with groups of people in games, KF is the best bunch of people I have ever had the privilege of calling my friends.

This is an awesome sign. Here is how plex prices work from an old comment of mine:
---
The population that buys plex for RL $(pvpers who lose more than they grind in game) is shrinking while the population that buys plex with isk (multiboxers and krabs who lose less isk than they grind) is increasing.
---
The plex price is just a reflection of the relative proportions of people who lose more than they grind vs people who grind more than they lose. As the game swings away from pvp to pve the plex price reflects that.
---
you really think that's *a lot* dont you? oh boy...
---
let me break this down for ya tho, to plex 4 accs its gonna be like 8 bil per month, now you gotta train the fax for like a year or buy the toon so add that cost, the out cyno is meh sp wise but still needs to be over 5m sp to extract and recoup some of that value, both bifrosts should be the same if thats all they do.
---
3 months of omega for those 4 accs, im assuming his main in the super(wow that actually hurt to type) is using real money, already is pretty much the price of his "investment", its just completely retarded when you add it all up. Literally all he needs to do is look at local, he doesnt even need to dscan, just get the fuck out if local goes plus neut, and just dscan if you dont wanna do that until the neut leaves, youre aligned already.
---

Tbf, the Astero is one of the best looking ships in the game. On the other hand, the audio doesn’t make a massive amount of sense when you think about it - a fitted Astero is like 60-70mil (or more if you put a real nice fit on it with blinged reppers and prop) so 100x that would be 6-7B+

Tcp internet traffic coming from Australia has to be routed through special Cisco switches once reaching the Western Hemisphere, where it is then inverted to right side up and passed back to regular internet backbone.

The process is reversed for network traffic to Australia, the packets are reconstructed upside down.

This causes lag, which is already exasperated by the DNS systems trying to resolve hosts in a country that doesn’t even exist.

Am I the only one who has my default "Warp to" range set to 50 klicks? Now if there was a time when the Dock/Jump command didn't exist, I could see using a zero-mark, but if my plan is to warp to something, I want to damn well have time to assess the thing when I get there before I decide to fiddle with it. Saved my bacon more than a few times when I decided to Nulldive for megacyte in a Venture before I realized that it is far easier to just eat the cost of materials and output more goods until I hit my desired profit goal.
---
it was basically something in game that would let you pick the game music that played
---
Which song was your favorite?
---
i dont remember, it wasnt around that long after i started in 2014
---
Lets be honest this depends if the blackout will be long or permanent.
---
So he's talking about concerns that ganking in null sec is now just like getting ganked in high sec. Boo-fucking-hoo. Sounds pretty balanced then.
---
Dont like it.
---
I imagine it's more to do with the Astero being one of the newer and cooler looking exploration ships at the time that video was made and they were looking for ways to work it into promo material. Especially as the starter packs available included Astero SKINs IIRC? But that would mean that is at least half true.

Not sure why you are being downvoted. You're right.

You probably should add the caveat that you can sell individual characters.

Better than a kickstand turd.
---
There aren’t any. I do probably 4-5 roams a day and we never find another similar sized gang. It’s either a random traveler or a 60 man blob on the gate
---
Iceland has both of those too.

---
Yes Init evicting HK.
---
&gt; It's really hard to have a dude cloaked on a gate reporting shit or even better a gate camp.
---
1) It is hard, because it needs to be 23/7 100% perfect attention, or won't work. We have a steady stream of 4 light blues per minute passing by our "entry" and "exit" systems, so unless someone sits there matching every gate flare with a decloak (with no room for missing even 1 second before decloaker cloaks back), it won't work.
---
2) It won't work anyway, because if you gatecamp, the overwhelming advantage is on the attacker. He can choose to engage your fleet upon seeing it, or pass. Meaning your options are get a fight and lose it, or sit there for hours instead of, you know, playing the game, and not get a fight. And since the best resulted is wasted hours of your life, might as well not login for the same best result!
---
In Great Wildlands it wouldn't even make a difference
---
And because it is gimped so hard, auto aggro will be used as often as auto targeting missiles.

Well, I was thinking of righting something witty to burn you, but your post is so idiotic it did my work for me.

With one interesting twist:

---
Also wanted to remove Pilots in Space from the map to balance it out. But none of this ever went anywhere.

I can't see it being permanent, to be honest.

---
You don't automatically warp if killed inside a bubble that then decays. Changing ship resets warping status, but doesn't automatically break lock (you can eject from a tackled ship, the lock/warp attempt is per ship not per player).
---
You've really never tried to warp from an undock/arty camp, died, and not noticed your pod doesn't continue on automatically?
---
It was either that or waiting for NC. to undock....
---
Definitely. The tax rate has dick all to do with it.
---
Still can’t do anything against a ramjag in a close orbit, even scrammed and webbed I was sig tanking fine, and the neuts cycles slowly enough that you can keep the scram up unless you get unlucky and it fires right before your scram cycles.

Can we work on the half brained dolphin called the Aeon?  Pls

We will. But fighting and decent PvP are not the same.

I love it but the crutch on the side looks a bit odd.
---
Meh, I laugh at the idiots who think this blackout is the beat thing since sliced bread and will get them more kills/content. I'm willing to bet that the majority of krab's out there like me who are risk adverse and don't want our shiny krabbing ships ending up on someone's killboard will just dock up for the blackout duration. 
---
Sure there will be some who undock and continue to krab, but the majority won't, and you can't force them to undock either.

But good luck roaming anyway, you just won't find me on your killboards!

No sensible person will be more confident pulling a cap out with LESS Intel, you're fucking nuts. It encourages balls of caps, but it also encourages fewer engagements due to greater lack of Intel. When a wormhole pops up people usually send out a scanner and dock up if they see a neut right after. Without local you have to make decisions quicker, and the solution is rarely "drop caps, idk what's happening". You'll be more likely to see people downshipping from supers to caps because they're cheaper while still good, or just not out at all.
---
I'm also speaking mostly defensively, and in terms of a larger collective. Anyone without a decently active, cap capable, standing fleet is just boned without taking extra precautions for their own safety.

This is correct. Good dudes from what I can gather, but I don't really do much with the incursions people. A bit insular with regard to the rest of the corp, except for the ones who have various positions elsewhere (one of the incursions officers is also one of the people who curates the wiki, for example, he's one of the only two whose names I can actually think of as people who I've interacted with), though. And I don't think everyone in the incursions community is part of the corp.
---
Actually tax rate helped a bit. 
---
If with the increased tax you need to pay more isk to flip plex.

I've also found that Fanfest seems to have more CCP content than Vegas (probably for obvious reasons).  It's also Iceland is pretty laid back compared to Vegas, in case your like me and not a massive fan of busy environments for more than a few hours.

r/evejobs is the subreddit your looking for buddy

Ccp have a website where you can download ALL 3D models with skins. If u need just 3d printing you can ignore the skin part. 
---
Once you have your 3d model my advise would be to go to a local 3d printing store (just Google them).

Somewhere online you should find the official website (i forgot it) but you can also download them from this repository https://github.com/Kyle-Cerniglia/EvE-3D-Printing

Tis a trap!!!
---
I think roaming gangs will be more common since catches are going to be easier, so not necessarily smart to get your cap out without an umbrella. I think we'll see a lot of confusion when it hits, and a lot of people losing their standing fleet because they under estimate their enemies. It's a pretty common tactic to hold someone down so you can get more kills once they commit and then you reveal the rest of your fleet.
---
How about this: Fitting a cyno reduces damage and mining yield by 50%
---
I think u mean buffed :)

And old AURA!

This change will be accompanied by a nerf to cap damage application, theyre not just gonna plug one hold in the sinking eve boat and leave the others unplugged

~~fixed~~ buffed

Set desto 5zxx and go do missions for pirates!
---
I have to wonder if there's any reason to go to (as opposed to through) lowsec other than fighting. The mining isn't as good as null. The mining isn't as safe as either null or high. I spend a lot of time in low and I've only ever seen a few miners. Non-combat ships are pretty much always either explorers (generally trying to get to a wormhole) or haulers of some sort (so maybe PI is a thing).
---
&gt;They've got a reputation for including higher skill solo players, but then every high skill solo player needs a group of lower skill players to meme on and look cool while doing it.
---
Kelon Darklight. There is none greater.
---
&gt;Unfortunately, Snuffed Out like dropping dreadnoughts on these sorts of guys
---
Lately, it's been combat-fit Rorquals, actually.
---
that's not completely true.
---
When you sell itels, you need to factor in the time it take a sale slot. eg if an item take a sale slot for 6 month, it's slot cost should be twice as another one.
---
That's for the trivially simplified part.
---
People want their investment to have a fixed minimum interest. If I can loan money to someone and get that money with 1% interest by month, there is no way I craft items if I have less than 1% interest per month.
---
What this means is that if I can have a 1% interest on money, I will definitely not accept to craft and sell items for less than 1% interest per month I have to wait after I bought the items for them. eg if I expect my items(I need to build by batch otherwise it's a waste of time to set it up. typically I craft by &lt;24h batch, or &lt;48, &lt;72H, so that I  can start the next batch every day at the same exact hour) to be sold by 6 months, I \*NEED\*  to be able to multiply the price by 1.01\^6 = +6.15% + slot cost.
---
Of course that's assuming you have no opportunity better than 1%interest  (and in my experience you often have much better). In my case the minimum interest per month is 20%. That mean that if I consider crafting this item, I need to add 1.2\^6 = +190% of the investment cost to consider it worth it. If more people start buying it, then my batch of items will be sold earlier (eg in 2 months), then I just need to add 1.2\*1.2 = 44% to the investment cost to make it worth crafting and selling. In the case of the mobile scan inhibitor, that means going from 25M investment cost to 72M SO for 6 month, or to 36M for 2 months (assuming a slot cost of 0 isk/slot/h).
---
So yeah, item is cheaper when more people buy it. Because you need to freeze investment over less time to sell one.
---
or how about a new server "equanimity"?
---
I guess you are talking about gaz and not regulars rocks.  
---
there are 2 kind of ship trying to catch you :  
---
1) some cloaky ship probing you, decloaking close to you and scramb you. you can see probes on dscan and the decloaking ship have a delay between and decloaking and be able to catch you. so, you gtfo before it's to late.  
---
2) a cloaky ship stay close to you without decloaking (can be tricky) and a sabre or un inty warp to the cloaky. they will point you as soon as they will be on grid but you will see it on dscan  
---
in one word : dscan  
---
last thing, if you need to run away, warp to a safe spot and not directely to your escape hole. some hunters will use 2 team, one to afraid you, one to catch you (if they know where you come from)

Sorry but FW have still a lot of players.        
---
Organize yourself and bring suggestions/demands to CCP as a group. 
---
No one will listen 1-2 guys.              
---
FW should be for new and small scale players.         
---
Simply demand from CCP that all FW is Cyno Jammed ... and even gates "to small" to gate capitals.
---
So you nerf the anom spawns and all the Uber krabs leave. Now you have less shit in space to kill. Jesus christ what i would give to be able to hunt the absolute spodbrains in DSONS.
---
Have you been presented with pvp data from during the different chat server breakdowns that affected local, as indicators of potential outcomes of no local? Or do you know if even ccp has looked at the data?
---
Got to agree I've been playing on an off for 5years I've tried most thing the only time I've stuck around is when I was in a good low sec fw Corp
---
And from what I've heard, they've been roaming around with these fleets, taking them through gates. Not just waiting for a cyno.
---
I feel like there was such a big change in the dynamics of the game after BNI was formed. Obviously they started out in lowsec, but with their move to null a lot of the big null blocs realised that they needed to harness the power of new players, which then gave rise to Horde *et al*. This then funnelled a lot of new players into the same places, whereas before they would have been spread out throughout the game.
---
nice clip, well fought. What do you think of the wolf as a fleet ship? Good, bad?
---
Let them come  we will be waiting
---
In game browser....
---
&gt; As I am in TEST, I will fight you. But as an Eve player, I hope you succeed in at least making it interesting.
---
Translation: I hope there will be enough killmails for my blob that we can all slap each others' backs about how hard a fight it has been?  
---
Everybody is playing Eve, from the elite solo pvper to the bears who will blue the galaxy (except maybe some smaller entity so the alliance mates will blow off steam on a week-end night) so they can krab in peace. They're all Eve players, let's not go around pretending just playing Eve is a bold thing to do.
---
Don't join a high sec corp, go to low/null sec or even wormhole you will learn much more about pvp you will also have more interesting pve.
---
GO/Ask in the subreddit evejob to find the corp of your dream.
---
Be aware that joining a big (null) alliance will make you more a n+1 and you will learn less about small medium gang pvp
---
&gt;And there were two contradicting promises. Equal vote in the consortium to management matters and not raising the tax...
---
He reiterated the promise of not raising the tax AFTER he had agreed to the consortium, presumably with the rules about equal vote already in place.  
---
In other words, he did not have to make that second promise, but he did.  
---
In even simpler words, he lied.
---
&gt; so not necessarily smart to get your cap out without an umbrella                
---
This is what people trying to explain CCP for a while now.         
---
Lack of local will not lead to dissolve of large groups, it will put bigger pressure on people to join them.              
---
Sorry CCP, but the issue is in Injectors.         
---
No one hope that you remove this $$$$$ making product, even if we want you to do it.                
---
But fix for the situation will be hard as you need to  :               
---
* keep game alive               
---
* incentivize small gangs           
---
* while keeping rorquals, capitals, supers and titans strong ^(to people that don't get it **WHY**. Imagine yourself paying a lot of money for a very fast car. Month later company comes and replace your engine with worst one letting you drive at 1/20 of initial speed.    **Will you buy anything from this company again?**)
---
Is it worthwhile as a jaunt for someone new-ish (a year this time), or is the marginal utility low for new bros?
---
I’d love to visit Iceland, but it’s a bloody long way from NZ (and expensive to boot).
---
&gt;So well, why not break the one that gives you less stress and more isk?
---
Imperium, btw
---
I'm thinking the real risk aversion will keep people in smaller ships or not out at all. Getting a new cap is a pain in the ass, misdirection and adapting by an attacker is easy.
---
Roaming is going to be easier, attacks more frequent. Most people flying caps for ratting are relying on smaller enemy punches and a bigger reinforcement. The laziness at which local provides an easy out for caps is so exploitable, without it people can't be lazy. So they're gonna fall back to the next best thing, they're not gonna commit more. They've learned to be lazy, and it's not going to go away soon.
---
Reduced anom respawns, and increasing isk/hour through buffs to ESS (while limiting where they can be anchored) would benefit a lot!
---
The subs at a place called Nonnabiti were good too, and they're open late.
---
People sub accounts for 30 days, the price dropped 10% in 2-3 days, so with your logic I'm guessing all the botters are resubbing around the same day each month?
---
Missions do get boring. It's the original PvE. Things like Abyssal PvE is much better.
---
&gt;BTW: I don't know what you understand with "not forced". But being attacked daily while two additional active fronts require big attention. This is burning out FCs and players... That sounds forced to me pretty much.
---
Forgot about this one:  
---
\- TEST took over the Keepstar, and now has to defend it.  
---
\- the additioal active fronts are TEST as the attacker.  
---
So everything stems from TEST's decisions to open these fronts - which is fine, because Eve, btw - but nothing was forced upon them.
---
Wait who are you again?  Does anyone know or give a shit?  Please get better at posting.
---
You can literally see it in the Video...

Oh we have pie. Plenty of them. We just put ham and/or veggies, you name it,  in ours.

---
Blockade is great.
---
I just realized how precious Abyssal Bookmarks will become.. the new ones are easily 60 au out from the star and the old ones from before the patch who are 150 au + out HOLY SHIT
---
If anything I think people will whine and quit for a bit or there will be a convenient deployment to lowsec and some maintenance fleets back home. What's the first thing you do when you login and want to rat? Look at Intel. Oh shit, there's no local. Oh there have been roaming gangs. Maybe I'll just ask around and drop out a few cruisers if it seems ok. If they get popped they'll whine, say it's unfair and logoff, 1000% It's a very good chance some line members fuck off instead of going on fleets "fucking bullshit local." It's not hard to demoralize an alliance.
---
Once the isk is sent you move it and proceed with the transfer. Can pay 1k plex if you petition ccp. They forgot to as the button
---
it's on the plate, so only cooking
---
&gt; Nonnabiti 
---
Hlöllabátar is better

Not true! I was able to join into provi whatbackwhen when I was only 5m or so. This was when I first started out kinda
---
It is no problem that you are new. Go to whichever one you can get to, you will have a blast.
---
Also consider eve down under (in Australia) for next year
---
That’s a great idea, thank you!
---
Agree.
---
Early days - This is awesome!
---
ORE ships introduced - Cool, but really would have preferred the old way to be the main way to mine.
---
Citadels - This SUUUUUUUCKS, not gonna quit though, still like the rest but I want to actually BUILD UP my stuff, not just plunk it down and hope no one sees.
---
Filaments and Triglavians - Oh hey, something new that doesn't suck bricks!
---
Today - Oh hell no, I'm staying out of this until things settle back down into something resembling sanity.
---
I dont get it.. is friendly-fire now a legal act?
---
What is the "engineering" reason for that little side appendix ?
---
And fabulous!
---
I like it but WHERE THE FUCK IS MY THRASHER REDESIGN?!
---
That's a little on the expensive side for me considering the meats involved. I'd be happy to share that with one or two others going by the size of the serve and price though.
---
I will admit to paying  £50 for a wagu steak in Australia though.
---
FW is cyno inhib.
---
Wowee we fixed lowsec
---
Big blocks will be able to most of the stuff still.          
---
You will be just mining without excavators - as you simply cannot save them on time from bombers that you don't know if they are near you.           
---
Will people tackle more supers?       
---
Sure, but if you have small area to cover and huge fleet that you can utilize - you can do it.      
---
Aka goons , test and maaaaaaybe new ph-panfam farm land.
---
Wait. If krabs are supply and wallet warriors are demand, then doesn't dropping prices mean there's more supply meaning more krabs?
---
Uh, i skipped the abyssals due to instancing.            
---
Like can you elaborate bit more?
---
Its wallymarts, its probably best if you smile and move on with a polite wave.
---
naah the game is lifeless husk of it former self. don't kid yourself
---
Price dropped as less people are subbing alts already.          
---
It is dumb to already dumb to rat or mine if the drifters are spawning on top of you and the blackout is coming.          
---
When you get 150k DPS on you from drifter fleet that just appeared on you ... well you are fucked, there is no counter play to spawned 'AI'.
---
you lost the difference in SP to your clone grade but never more then 5% of your overall SP
---
nah, regular capitals are fine in lowsec.
---
Guess the industrialists will move outside FW space then because JF?
---
In goons there are no restrictions.
---
If you enter an abyssal deadspace pocket just before downtime and dont make it out before downtime ends then when abyssal deadspace was introduced you were thrown in up to 200-300 AU out of the star. Then they patched it once that you were thrown out I think it was 172 AU out of the star and then last and final time its now a random positoon that can be up to 60-70 au out of the star. Which could very well be outside of Dscan range in mid to smaller systems. Perfect for sneakily bringing in 200+ Bombers,
---
Dscan is &lt;15 AU (14.2 i think) so even 20 AU is amazing :D
---
Not necessary, the plex price is just the ratio between the two groups, you could have the same pattern if pvpers were leaving but krabs were leaving at a faster rate. If you want to get an "is eve dieing" answer you would be better off looking at trade volume.
---
The thing is they can pay to get their sp up now and have just as much capability as characters twice as old. No longer are you simply always behind a more senior player.  A reset would do nothing.
---
It also might be worth making a new account, i think new accounts get like quite a bit of "free" SP. Also check out the new starter pack they just released. For a fiver you get 1m free SP.
---
Happy cake day fella
---
I think people will get tired of being harassed and numbers will falter. It happens all the time. But people will die, they will complain, they'll move closer to support, sites will get scarce, they'll say the game is stupid right now, fleet gets smaller every day. Then you get to pick at what is left and pings go out for bodies, people get mad they have to login to save idiots. It is a very fast downhill when their wallet isn't growing.
---
ofc but the measurements are from the center of the solar system. If a mining anomaly is on the edge of it you might well need the full 60+ au to be safe.
---
marauders are crazy strong ships, their one of the fastest battleship hulls if you can use your mjd every cd (check out some big miker videos)

if anything I would just tweak the insurance payout up just a tad and call it a day
---
Our corp were total n00bs when we joined Providence in 2007, CEO had played a year or so, members much shorter. Also I can remember that there were quite a few Groups in NC (the original) that had quite low barriers, like MostlyHarmless f.e.
---
This is DJ J-Box spinning your favorite ships to all the best hits this galaxy has to offer.
---
Ask yourself how PVP in null would look if defenders bridge in 50+ subcaps onto a tackled miner instead of 4 or 5 capital alts, then it becomes clear what the real problem is. Capitals are simply too good and kill fights before they start. They need a lot less versatility especially if they're unassisted.
---
And what if that person is in a kitsune over 100k away?
---
Bigger ships have less risk. They are the only ones able love long enough  to cyno in a fleet
---
Beneath the asteroids no?
---
damn i love the bassline in this one
---
Except you always pay the 1-2% sales tax, which you've now paid twice.
---
Well yes, but if you are 15 AU from nearest celestial and if someone is warping between is not getting closer to you - you are pretty safe.        
---
In one system i have like 200  BM of this kind.            
---
Some time ago people tried to hunt me :D          
---
For sake of playing with them i was warping in my rattle between the most distant BM randomly for like 30min before they stopped trying to probe me.            
---
(not that i was not able to logout or dock safely)              
---
It was quite annoying for them as i was showing in the center system most of the time as i was warping between bookmarks all around it.
---
Yea its just more about blopsing stuff,.. 200+ bombers out of nowhere will be dangerous even for a super.
---
I don't say you are wrong. But from my perspective CCP have choose wrong way.             
---
This is pretty simple. People that wanted to play "WH style" already are doing it.          
---
Imagine yourself if at some point CCP decided that each time player undock he need to mine for 15min first.               
---
Will you play in a game that is just fucking annoying to you?               
---
It is pretty simple.
---
Clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose.
---
All those elite PVP-ers rejoicing they can "finally get some dank fights" apparently disagree with you. And they must know about FW, because they all claim they know every aspect of this game. vOv
---
This seems like you are mostly thinking about cloaky camping. A windup cyno will result in death of the cyno ship in most fleet battles
---
Lets see how this works out. Basically this price decline in Injectors and PLEX should come frome un"subbing" plexxed PvE-farms, no matter if they are piloted or botted.
---
In the longer run we could see PLEX price dropping to a degree where SP-Farms start to be slightly profitable again. I personally would not like that.
---
Also in the longer run it will benefit casual players that just want to plex 1 or 2 Accounts for having fun without the need to build up a scaled farm to get the ISK for subbing the farm AND the fun accounts.
---
I'll buy that character from you for 100 mil isk
---
&gt;The site frequently publishes stories sympathetic to Russia’s government.

I just had flashbacks of podexpressing away multiple subsystem 5s
---
*undocks hyperspatial super*
---
Seriously, a specialized Hel can outrun a cruiser on long warps.
---
"On March 20th, YC120 a guy in a Rifter killed another guy in an Incursus, prompting a 'gf' in local from both pilots."
---
*Still cheaper than buying a coffee mug from CCP.*
---
Afk vnis and safe bots get the axe - ratting is more rewarding.
---
Now make pirate anoms analogous to cattle grazing on pasture. Bounty isk can be an actual resource with relevant risk/reward.
---
The bubble you won't warp because theres no way to initiate until bubble's down.
---
But yep. Arty camp is prime example right there. I'd say you're right.
---
The real problem is people are having alts, otherwise those backup people would be bored to death
---
Or you could leave cynos the same, and change teleportation mechanics. 
---
Right now, *all jumps*, no matter if they're 1LY or 6LY, take the same length of time. One session-change timer.  
---
Further, all jumps *and* bridges, will land at 5000m... no matter what class of ship is teleporting. 
---
CCP could change that so it varies on ship size, or some kind of manual piloting. Right now, there's *no* player action that can differentiate between a talented pilot, and a mentally deficient one. The universality of teleportation mechanics is boring as fuck. 
---
And you know what this could result in? A *fun* alternative to Jump Fatigue.
---
He's talking about supply and demand of PLEX, not of ISK.
---
capitals are used if you have capital supremacy. if you don't, they are not.  
---
Furthermore, they are used when the response fleet in subcap doesnt have the numbers to make the attackers flee quickly. So a few capitals apply pressure if ignored.  
---
if not ignored, you can kite HAW dreads, and you can defang fighters pretty easily.
---
Elo was not found
---
And those who adapt and use DSTs to seed markets inside, or build their product at the market, will make a killing.
---
Yeah I love the Imicus. It was my first T2 frigate, I still have the original one I bought, I never take it out any more but I love that ship more than any others, if Goon space was burning and I could only pick one ship to make it out alive with it would be my Imicus
---
more major than that, like reddit worthy videos
---
TLDR Null Politics:  Bla bla bla, blue doughnut circle jerk, endless bot fields, super umbrella.  Drifters have been farming tears, we are finally getting delayed local.  Consider yourself up to speed.
---
Did some FW a while ago, found it a bit boring... Wormhole space is much more fun, although it requires a bit more dedication
---
Short term, probably, but with the mechanic change it'll be about a week till people get tired of it because roaming is gonna explode. People get super pissed having to respond to activity instead of lazily flicking drones, imagine how mad they'll get when the rate of pings doubles.
---
adapt or die
---
Setting the bar to "reddit worthy" might not be the best idea.
---
Roaming will explode for a week, the people will get bored of having supers dropped on them, and there being no engageable targets
---
For a long time I´ve proposed the idea to make different kind of Cyno modules. A base Cyno that needs some time to spool up (1-2 minutes) before reinforcements can jump in, and then a combat Cyno that can only be fittet on certain classes. Was thinking about Recoon or other T2 plattforms. For those who use it with Corvettes to jump their freighters it wouldn´t change that much, and for those who want to jump directly on top of an enemy, they need a specialised ship.   
---
Also, with the spoolup you give the enemy time to deploy a cyno inhibitor
---
then once videos of a battle in certain systems hit 1k views
---
Anza was good once?
---
Having alts is fine. There's nothing wrong with people keeping a subcap alt in a staging system to bridge to a cyno if some rorq is tackled. That's actually the goal because it kicks off a fight.
---
Hard agree! Faction Warfare's the first thing I dabbled with since when I was new and it just makes me feel so wanted like even when I was new as long as I know which to tackle I'm good and every pilot counts. Everything's easy to replenish since most of the time its frigate fights.
---
it's everybody's favorite song

---
£17, cash only iirc.
---
What you're saying is as soon as you have capital supremacy you win every fight by default. If you can't see why this is bad for the game then you're beyond help.
---
A not shitty hunter, but again highly recommend skilling yourself by watching some scanning tutorials so you can stop being a shitty hunter. Just a kind suggestion tho.
---
You're garbage is what I'm getting at here.
---
Lack of local encourages more active play, it's going to deeply expose how precarious a position null ratting and mining actually is. It's boring as fuck, predictable, and necessary. This is gonna filter out a lot of the lazy people and that'll trickle into lower fleet participation and a lot of silly kills and pissed off line members. I don't even play right now but it's gonna be an absolute salt fest, just like drifters are.
---
It's worth mentioning that CCP put the "star" DLC pack on sale for 50% off recently. The starpack included 500 plex, 30 days gametime and 2x MCTs. 
---
This flooded the market with MCTs since this the offer was worth picking up for anyone who paid for their subscription with RL $. For just $25, you got 30 days, could plex another 30 days with the 500 PLEX, then sell the MCTs and buy another 30 days with the proceeds while having 1.5b\~ ISK left over, for $10 less than a 3 month long subscription. This was also the best $ to ISK you could have gotten too, being considerably more efficient than even the most expensive PLEX package.   
---
cheap MCTs benefit skill farmers a lot, cutting down their costs and this potentially allowed them to lower the cost to the consumer too with more aggressive trading margins.
---
If the spoolup takes longer then the cyno inhibitor, why bother fitting a cyno at all?
---
If it doesn't, it will not change anything
---
Oh, right, early morning is not good for thinking :)
---
I use rushlocks cap stable active fit for sansha 6/10s and i have a very basic t2 passive fit i use for drone sites. Theyre gonna have a gard time running sites higher than 6 tho as many of those have dps or tank checks that require a t3c or a rattle to handle
---
I second the request for the Kronos love. How can I role play the Police with the Kronos Police Skin when the Kronos itself is pretty underwhelming?
---
Better off with the Hyperion
---
I'd agreed but would add it's even better to be there with corp &amp; alliance mates.
---
I'd definitely say do an eve down under first, if you enjoy that then Fanfest is just a larger version but with more fish and ice
---
CCP saw AT WH people cheer at no local during the times it crapped out nearly every other day last year. As CCP has little new stuff themselves to break the stalemate, we get the blackout. 
---
It'll be crazy for the first few days, and then it'll be Volta and the lot hunting a whole lot of nothing.
---
Doesn't sound like you know what the fuck you are talking about tbh, or have even bothered to look at my KB because then you would see I catch plenty.  You don't even use your character's name on here because you chat a lot of shit and probably can't back any of it up, but your trash talk is weak sauce my friend, 3/10
---
It depends of what you call “resetting”. 
---
Say CCP cleans up the database. Universe is starting from scratch. Is it “reset?”. I guess it can be called like that. However...
---
Does it clean up memory of people? Nope.
---
Does it break up social bonds players built over the time? Nope.
---
Does it removes all Internet resources with information and how-tos created by players over the years? Nope.
---
Will older players still have “upper hand” over newer ones? Yes. Even if starting from zero older ones will have it faster and easier by using knowledge they have. 
---
Basically being “reset” the game will not start from scratch and instead it will “continue”. Alliances and groups will be created back immediately, PvPers will go PvP, PvEers will go PvE and evade PvP, etc... Nobody will suddenly forget what they were doing before and start something new. 
---
So... While Falcon’s post sounds brutal and bold it does not tell anything about real future.
---
Yeah I remember that. God bless Eve-Radio lotteries. Won 50 mill on my first ever entry after chilling in there during my trial. Bought all the skills I'd need for a long one with that. 2006 started just before Red Moon Rising. DJ Dawny I believe? Going back a bit now.
---
Iceland's an expensive place to eat, I'm afraid.

[https://i.imgur.com/kb5DCqH.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/kb5DCqH.jpg) ;)
---
the kilo of meat defeated me.
---
Moderation is key, for both.
---
And yet again you talk out of your ass and assume stuff you probably shouldn't. Just yesterday I already took more risk that you probably ever did in null, and went for a fight with terrible odds, lost a fleet, killed some. Check it for yourself: https://br.inyour.space/?s=2439&amp;b=8688660&amp;e=90&amp;t=gz3Wc
---
But keep projecting your risk aversion onto other people because that's the only thing you think drives people decision.
---
Fuck off now.
---
Yeah, what we consider standard and basic fitting knowledge now was a carefully guarded art form back in the day, when you'd find people belt ratting.
---
Argueing with a completely broken ship that an unbroken ship can't do nothing about it ....
---
It’s going to be worth it when I can't speak to any of the guards to tell them they're shit
---
You really overestimate supers without Intel. Supers die with stellar Intel all the time. Imagine them without the usual comfy blanket of knowing exactly who is around them. Supers will get dropped, the invading fleet fucks off down the way docking everyone up in the systems if they're smart. Even if you can't kill a super, if you can get them to respond you win. After they get dropped they have to go back, which is a migration by itself. In that time the Invaders have free reign to magic wand, attack idiots, harass miners, mop up drones and fighters. If some pvp corps group up with wormholers during the time the combination will be devastating to morale.
---
Lol, i think this is why eve is removing local. Might be a step forward in getting control over their game again.
---
&gt; I have thought about it and I still believe that it is human behavior at the core of the blue donut, not game mechanics. People banding together to protect themselves.
---
Human behavior is to play the most optimal way, barring various biases (which might force to play them suboptimally in specific conditions). If sticking to blue donut is not the most optimal way to play - it will break apart.
---
Look at the wormholes. You have different set of rules - no significant power projection, system has limited farming capacity, fleet movements are limited by mass. Everyone sits in their holes and there are very few blues, if any, for any entity in there. The only large-scale operations which get multiple entities together are evictions, and they are quite rare - that's the showcase of EVE's n+1 &gt; n in large-scale combat (and large-scale combat is forced by need to deal with significant defender advantage).
---
When you have such obvious example right in front of you - it's just dumb to pretend that bluewagoning is human nature which cannot be fixed.
---
implying the ins and outs wouldn't be camped like tama
---
They removed the juke box?
---
that looks scary, how many logis did it take to tank that?
---
The idea is that you don´t use a standart cyno to cyno in into a battlefield, but when you cyno somewhere when you are alone. Hence why the idea of a combat cyno that is instant, but with limitations
---
Only a kilo? Thought it was more than that. I knew it was expenisive hence me asking (indirectly)  how much it was.
---
j-space best space
---
You my friend, need to learn the fun of being a dictor pilot in the massive fleet vs fleet engagements, lowsec helps. as itll train your smallgang/solo pilot skills.
---
but if you can get your OWN warpin, to a 256man fleet, bubble them as they try to escape, and get 80 of them killed. all whilst successfully cloaking and burning off, only to survive, decloak and scram thier monitor FC before the bubble goes down.
---
eve is what you make of it, lowsec is great, nullsec is great, but they both can be shit too. depends what YOU make of it.
---
ive even had a year of hisec living. afk mining hisec, piracey in hisec, ive tried pretty much most things aside from live in a butthole.
---
Null doesn’t need to be reset, there needs to be a lot more risk for the rewards and better counter play. Especially when it comes to faxes, supers, haw dreads, and carriers.
---
\--Sun
---
How do you engage them outside their capital umbrella when they never have to leave because they have infinitely spawning resources inside of it.
---
Selling some DCUs to a dozen randoms is not "making a killing", in nullsec you can buy, build and sell worth billions every day without even touching jita.
---
This is proof that the local change will hurt CCP financially. No matter what you think about the whole mess, that result will benefit no one in this game.
---
whats fun is if you turn it upside down, it can show relevant 'player base'
---
Is that paid by the buyer or seller?
---
yep 64 bit vs
---
Or is it paid by the seller but the fee recovered in isk value of character?
---
Or you could adapt to hunting ratters under a hostile umbrella
---
Nice video!
---
I just gave my shit away and started again. Its not the end of the world.
---
Implying people doesn't safely move stuff through or around Tama on a daily basis.
---
Supers not under an umbrella die. Intel has little to do with it.
---
When you can drop a fleet of super caps on anything that tackles you... Intel becomes irrelevant other than to avoid needing to light a cyno to begin with.
---
its not a waste if you know its sold before its dead, but hey, i guess you never sold anything actually worth something
---
I don't like the new gallente design, they are too shiny, they need to be matte, veiny, and throbbing. Sexy and organic looking. Also dominix redesign just go grocery store get a handsome potato and take a picture and it's done..
---
- Seller lists character for sale
---
- Buyer sends isk to character for sale
---
- Seller transfers isk off character for sale
---
- Seller goes into their account management and pays fee to transfer character to another account.
---
Lowsec is honestly the only reason I play nowadays. Easy to find fights.
---
its linked to the price of skill injectors these days, you will get a bit less than it would take to inject 43m sp
---
Especially these days
---
That's cool. But the post is about new player retention. New players don't have the capacity of game knowledge to fly a dictor like a pro in your 256 man fleet
---
I remember most of these and think that it was in many ways better then. Is this a sign of becoming a bittervet?
---
Give cyno duration penalty to capitals like entosis. 😊
---
*Laughs in Blackout*
---
This would never get gamed by a large alliance looking to put adverts in to the system description rather than local.
---
I flied with Tr0pa de Elite recently. They are really good as well.
---
It's just a blip.
---
Can vouch, high SP were required and no one would accept you without it.
---
Yep and loads of elements of the ui are bugging out.
---
Agree. FW, like Eve Online in general, is a ton of wasted potential.
---
preach it brother
---
I agree lowsec could use a buff, but I'm not sure how. Buff pve rewards? It's still incredible easy for a new players to get stomped by older players that know what they're doing in lowsec
---
Alliances will draw in and set requirements for cap ratting, sites will run low, people will skirt the rules or not login, the power will shrink slightly, lesser ratters will take the brunt of the punishment because they don't get protection, standing will get smaller. This is kind of a tumbling effect of people not being able to rat their hearts out and having to keep docking or responding to pings.
---
You can look back as far as you want, these things happen every time pressure is applied to nulli corps for a bit. Attackers are gonna be laughing the entire time.
---
you only pay that after you sell.
---
yes
---
I run ded sites. Spawn my own 6/10s farming rally points, buy bookmarks for 10/10s from the carrier ratters in my alliance, and run any 6/8/10/drone site i scan down. $
---
How do you know?
---
Yah people would start out mining in a thorax until they could fit a mining domi. Help fill the corp coffers while you skilled up.
---
fair
---
Jesus Christ
---
What ship and fit do you use? How safe is it for solo?
---
FW you probably get 1-2 fights per hour and 99% you die
---
Wtf thats my favorite venue.
---
Assuming your big Corp has the most basic of basic jf routes (to and from jita) you'll be fine
---
Indeed, so that one guy in the 250 man fleet is going to have loads of fun, that one time he actually manages that once every 2 months.
---
If you are happy with your corp you will be fine. Park an Alt in Jita. You will get most Stuff in Dodixie too. Just check evepraisal so you can check if 16 Jumps are worth it. Check your Corp btw, They may offer some Logistic-services too

I’ve always wondered... do lead paint chips taste good? Or is it just hype?
---
Hi,
---
I don't 3d print models, but I hand make them.
---
I have also been developing model kits, so that players could enjoy constructing a hurricane etc from scratch and applying their own paintjob! 
---
These are some large models I have worked on:
---
Orthrus: [https://imgur.com/gallery/NWVp3](https://imgur.com/gallery/NWVp3)
---
Hurricane: [https://imgur.com/gallery/POvRR](https://imgur.com/gallery/POvRR)
---
I have a few others in progress, at varying stages.
---
I would be interested in the design challenges associated with a "tiny" harpy.
---
If you give me your desired dimensions of the finished model and how it will be displayed/mounted, I am happy to look at a modest cost estimate for a donation to a charity of my choice. I am unable to sell them; CCP will not reply to my emails. 
---
Thanks
---
Yeah with Jzfs
---
Die more
---
When I first started learning pvp in lowsec, I lost every solo fight for 3 months. Not kidding.
---
When I got my first solo kill, I was literally dancing around the house.
---
Now I'm a fucking force to be reckoned with.
---
It's expensive, but nothing, NOTHING in eve will hone your solo skills like the crucible that is lowsec.
---

---
39B on a bady day and 45B if someone really wants it. Good core pvp focused towards battleships, but that might work against you because not that many people out there fly Marauders unless it's PVE. Check the extraction price as well before you accept an offer on the character bazaar. You can value the base extracted 5m sp character at 4B at most. Don't forget to factor in the 4B PLEX cost or the $20 that you need to transfer the character. If you transfer via PLEX open a support ticket to expedite the transfer process. Happy transferring.
---
I'd rather see smaller numbers but which I know are closer to the *actual* population of the game (even multiboxer, w/e).
---
I agree. Spodbrains dont
---
Really? I found wormhole space way less fun.
---
Everyone's cloaky all the time, sneaking up on eachother, no local.
---
If by fun you mean "haha, that guy never saw me coming and I have him totally outgunned!" then yes...it's way more "fun".
---
FW people are checking the local and their d-scan like crazy so if you see someone looking for a fight (hanging out in mediums) you show up with something you don't think they'd be scared of and you 1v1. Overshipping can be an issue cause people won't take fights they know they can't win, but if you fly something reasonable (or better yet, kill their cruiser with a frigate like a boss) then they'll usually take the fight.
---
I don’t think it was all, i think you lost a random SP. i do remember they were expensive (i had to pay 50mil for my pod insurance). I remember i was podded once raged, tried to reship for revenge and was podded again causing sp loss. I Raged so hard back then i cant remember what happened lol. I dont think i lost millions tho.
---
thats what they were made for, my dude
---
Goons can, almost noone else does. You have 40,000 people who are locked into creating a region that is self sufficient. Almost nowhere else is that the case and if you believe it is you're misguided.
---
cant rmt for vodka anymore blyat :(
---
I did say "or around", but besides that I've moved a DSTs through Tama on odd timezones.
---
Fleet up is at 0100 Eve time.   I do know they allow outsiders but I don't exactly know their rules.
---
to note, its the enemy that has the 256 man fleet,
---
ive had brand new pilots who have shown more actual pilot skill, without any game knowledge, by being thrown into the deep end and monitored properly than most nullsec pilots or lowsec capital dunkers.
---
Really sorry that your botting and RMT empire is on the verge.  I can hook you up with job references if you like.    Please PM me in game, I charge 2 bil per reference.
---
Dude, stop calling every non-combatant player a bot if you'd like to taken seriously. Downvote me all you want, everyone with an ounce of macro economic understanding knows I'm right.
---
We have a pretty good market in Esoteria :)
---
Rags go zoom zoom
---
Lowsec will improve your module micromanagement for sure but there's a lot more to solo than that.
---
Sorry human player, I'm just trying to meme here.  I'm really sorry if your safe, risk free, legit non-botting ratting empire is on the verge.  If you would like to play Apex Legends now that null ratting won't be EZ mode please let me know.
---
I do weekly(ish) updates on news and politics, although the current Drifter invasion has subsumed most of the Nullsec News content as it's been a better thing to focus on, but here was my [last major update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cis0_9mompk) on the general state of things. 
---
Ultimately, the higher level politics will nearly never concern you as a line member, just determine who you're fighting and why. As other people in this list have mentioned, there's a few major newbie friendly large nullsec organisations such as Karmafleet (The Imperium), Brand Newbros (Legacy Coalition), Brave Newbies (Also Legacy Coalition), Pandemic Horde (PanFam) &amp; Knight Odds (ProviBloc) that you can join to get experience w/ nullsec gameplay - But I'd suggest moving on from them when you can and exploring smaller entities and getting a feel for the game in a place where your individual contributions can matter.
---
I've never seen a fleet lock me up so fucking fast when I first tried flying a sabre. Yolo'd right into the thick of it- bits of armor being smashed off, launched a couple bubbles on the blob before I went down. Podded. Bought another sabre. Repeat.
---
ANZA had a "if you wanna fly to null- you need the OK by us, and SP" rule. If not- You were confined to low/highsec.
---
Git gud scrub etc
---
Wrote a similar post about smaller goals a while back, totally agree, sprawling space empires are literally suffocating us.
---
Ah but there was ghost training
---
As opposed to killing ratting VNI's in a cloaked Loki? Calling every other non-combat-PVP activity "risk averse" is pure hypocrisy my friend. Most PVP'ers avoid risk just as much.
---
&gt;	krabs are leaving 
---
hahahaha
---
I don't think you'll run into issues with ammo in Dodixie. It's more the stuff that doesn't get used that often that isn't seeded into Dodixie. 
---
Like the commenter above instructed, make an alt and fly it into Jita. Whenever you find something that isn't seeded in Dodixie and you absolutely need it, send money to your alt, have your alt purchase the item and send a courier contract to where you live. It'll cost a bit and will take a day or so to arrive, but living far away from Jita isn't much of an issue. People living 50j from Jita are doing just fine.
---
Alright, I've been thinking of making the move out of null, not sure no local will make it that much better for me as my PVP is shite, and I can't really hunt / fight in null on my own anyway. Where should I start looking for Low Sec FW Corps?
---
you can still camp, you'll just be more effective.  so a buff to cloaky camping?
---
I tried getting into Eve 3 times, the third time I stuck around.
---
Because I immediately went looking for a FW corp to PvP with. Then I was playing on and off, until I found a corp in NPC Null, this is where I _really_ got into Eve heavily.
---
Sadly both of these areas are so ignored by CCP that 'neglected' is a nice way to put it. If some love would be put towards NPC Null in terms of more ways of making isk - I personally think that Lifeblood hit NPC Space even more than it hit lowsec - more areas (drone regions, yo) and maybe even a lowsec gate to Stain? It sounds like a joke but I have lived in Stain and that would really help.
---
FW beacon entry mechanics are incredibly stupid and promote shit pvp/fits and players will remain scared chickenshits who can't fly because of it. That's the problem.
---
As long as the mechanics remain the same, FW will be shit.
---
Christ what an abomination. You just going to magically summon some cap?
---
You know the first day I moved from lowsec to null a svipul came after my condor. He was AB scram, I was MWD long-point. I held him for over 5 minutes while my friends flew out to kill him. His slingshot skills were sub-par to say the least.
---
Lowsec teaches you more than module micromanagement
---
Having fun in lowsec? 
---
*Snuffed Out wants to know your location*
---
Please look at my KB before making comments like this.  I use cloaky lokis almost never, fight outnumbered often and take risks whenever I can.  I have zero respect for people who risk nothing, whether that be in PVP or PVE.
---
You monsters.
---
Dodixie is perfectly decent market
---
Honestly never heard of it.  We use players typing in a chat channel.  But thanks for playing
---
No like seriously you shouldn’t exist in game.
---
You have now summoned u/stainguy
---
&gt; everyone with an ounce of macro economic understanding knows I'm right
---
I am a studied economist, and I can tell you that the current steps were dearly needed to safe the EVE economy from collapsing as it did on the Serenity server ... due to a titan-Heavy blue donut that was safe krabbing and RMTing the shit out of the game.
---
Maybe they’re in low sec?  It’s a sandbox go find then.
---
Well sure, but if you are in ratting BS you are going down to 4 bombers.        
---
200 bombers can be done by PH, Imperium, Test ... or some public groups.        
---
With 200 people you are much easier just to put in some spy to warn your group.               
---
TBH i am waiting for public BM now.          
---
Like imagine yourself being able to be in this kind of bomber fleet ... sit on the BM and at the same time create a bookmark on it that you just shared with specific person in your group.             
---
Warp in cyno sabre ... and jump in smartbombing capitals on top of the fleet of bombers :D
---
Below the astroids yes?
---
Mate, I was speaking generally. But if you really think that non-combatants don't take risks, I don't know what to tell you. They take the risk of undocking. Because if they run into a hunter, they don't stand a chance. The only chance they had was seeing it coming with some degree of time to spare to get to safety. Now they won't have even that. Explain to me what the fun in that is?
---
But anyway, whether we agree on the change or not is beside the point of my original reply, which is that CCP will feel this in their purse. Whether it's for the right or wrong reasons doesn't matter in the end, they still need the money if we want to keep playing this game.
---
Sounds like you’re just looking in the wrong places still
---
Yeah same, with two clients up with 64 bit I drop frames a lot more now.  I don't think it was a problem a month ago as I never noticed anything wrong, but recently it has been glaringly obvious
---
I have 3 erebus for sale, well 1 ready, 1 in parts and 1 in materials.    
---
Im pretty happy with any increase for minerals at this point.
---
But but what about the little guy in nullsec
---
No you did it!
---
nah just bridge in chemo fleet (cloacky smartbomb proteuses) the Covert Cyno in the fit is less suspect
---
Goons are 40 something jumps away from jita and they seem to be doing fine!  It all depends on the ground not location for most part
---
I think lifeblood improved NPC null. CCP have stated that one day player owned jump bridges for lowsec or NPC Null could be a thing so let's stay hopefully towards that happening. I think there are alot of ways to make ISK in NPC Null. What more ways do you believe could be added?
---
I think your br tool is wrong because NC would melt be on the same side as goons.  I stopped there.  You’re just a noob and still have no clue what you’re doing or talking about.  
---
Risk aversion has always been a component of the decision making in this game.  Since day one.  And you’re making assumptions about “risk taking”.  Who’s the ass?
---
Such a retard
---
Lmao so true.
---
Better chance CCP reads it. They're just on reddit for the luls
---
But you cannot bubble, and if you light the normal cyno then smartbombing rorquals are pretty good.
---
No
---
You could change it to  **Fitting a cyno reduces damage, mining yield and remote repair by 100%** and it wouldn't matter because mostly we use hics and dics to do the cynoing and only thing they do is tackle and cyno.
---
Flying your ship comes under the same umbrella. Regardless whether it's low or null, there are bads everywhere.
---
CCP would fuck it up. What you're asking for is a battlereport. Maybe u/Squizz could code something on zkill that would have a battlereport tab for systems where people can submit a start time and end time for mails to be included along with either a write up or URL to one on reddit for example.
---
Same. Big delay in show info too.
---
Well if you speak truth, you have pounds of understanding, he's only talking about people with ounces...
---
Just put a cap ship limit in low sec like 1 or 2  and no super caps except in 0.1s
---
Or simple marked fluctuation?
---
Yeah, everyone saying this is because of game mechanics is pretty wrong I think. Star pack on sale on a new referral account comes out to under $4 a bil if you throw that new character away, if you include the Omega it's like $2.20 a bil.
---
16 Jumps isn't much at all, you'll be fine
---
I don’t think in this way at all, actually I’m not much of a predator in W-space, but you have to think a lot more about what you are doing, a mistake usually results in a ship loss, but the gratification that comes from escaping death is much greater in w-space than in FW
---
Lowsec probably would have a better chance at holding your average gamer of today than snoozesec toobad CCP neglects it and doesn't even try to use FW as a way to get newbies into the PvP part of the game
---
Watch out, guys!
---
Panfam and friends were only ever able to take the shield timer down against Test/Goons.  Now Panfam has a stake in TTT so they will probably defend it also, or at the lest not attack, so how is anyone else going to actually kill TTT, let alone even get the shield timer?
---
Damn, what kind?
---
please, im begging you.
---
remove the ' key from your keyboard
---
Better but still not great, i wish they looked on pinterest spaceships for a bit for some inspiration
---
What are the best/most active faction warfare corps out there atm?
---
How much isk can a low SP alpha get just running plexs though? 
---
A two day old character might have fun, but you'll still need to use RL cash or an alt in null to generate decent isk.
---
oh god oh fuck
---
Cause reducing their hp by a factor of 10 doesn't equal increasing the pool of Dps ships by a factor of 1.1 - I know I know a bees brain is small and only made to sniff spod and count ticks
---
Someone should update the other game names...
---
Thanks for the heads up! gonna give a look at karma fleet! i dont particularly care about beeing in goonswarm goons. I just though tey had specialized manufacturing corps and thats what i was mostly interested in.
---
Still it might be something in their SiG system i keep reading about....
---
Thanks again good sir!
---
That's what your Gecko is for.  Even better, don't let the small stuff get that close.  But in any event, you can find a hard counter for every fit - it doesn't mean the fit or ship itself are no good.
---
Thank you sir
---
They are* x2
---
I have been saying this for years.   When me and 3 of my friends first started we joined a FW corp.  When we quit the game and came back 4 years later we joined a FW corp.  Before citadels and bots it was a great place to be and it taught you some really important things.
---
\- How to make isk on your own via LP.
---
\- How to fight in small gangs/solo.
---
\- How to not die all the time.
---
\- Basic fleets commands.
---
You also made tons of friends as your where fighting for hours on end for a common objective.  The best thing about it to was it was geared towards low SP players.  Also you fought every night.   Now I imagine the new player null experience is jump 40 jumps for some blue balls.
---
i was expecting a structure bash
---
Injectors/extractors are pegged to the PLEX, with multiple pilot training certificates also affecting Injectors.
---
On the 9th a sale on MPTC's was over (which flooded the market) and dropped the price to about 75% of normal price, while at the same it is mid-week, where there are less buyers than sellers and we are in July, which is a lowpoint of EVE activity, historically.
---
Pretty much perfect storm.
---
Before lifeblood I fought with my group over R64s with other groups in the area. We were pretty good so we were able to plex our entire corp using the proceeds. I know that people now have rorqual alts to do this, but this was not something anyone had as we were all PvP focused.
---
You can get industry alts to mine moons (not a viable choice for everyone) or run missions. I don't consider that a lot of ways to make isk, I'd even go as far and say that those are crappy ways of making isk. If you've ever been to Venal and noticed that 80% of the activity in that region happens in the few systems where burner missions spawn you will know what I mean.
---
It's temp, sept/october will see a rebound in the market.
---
Creepiest truth. Updoot
---
You can download all the files from SoundCloud to keep locally, too.
---
what kind of internet do you have in such places?
---
Also can spiders be a reason behind electricity shut down?
---
Hey small gang and stealth bomber are really fun in null :) not everything is bad. Except the zerg
---
There are significantly less people living in wormhole space nowadays. So sites will typically get clumped up in a closed off system and not get run. My c2 static opened up to a system the other day with like 13 signatures and 20 or so anoms. So they're out there, just not enough people are running them.
---
The new player experience is honestly just a total mess in this game. I've tried to get into it a few times and the game does not make it clear at all what is both realistic *and* fun.
---
Personally I think CCP needs to lay it out very clearly what will be fun and not. A lot of people come in wanting to be a miner and the new player experience makes it seem like that it a totally legit and fun option rather than being boring. On the other hand, much more fun things like WH exploration don't get anywhere near as much mention. CCP pretend that every path in the game is as fun as the last, but then who can blame the new players that believe them and end up bored out their minds?
---
Also, I feel that once you start making some good money, the game doesn't really give you any clues on what to spend it on, especially if you're a solo player, making the whole thing feel kinda pointless
---
We will see more drop going into august, as even fewer ppl will play next month.
---
Sept/oct we will start to see a correction of the market.
---
If you say so...
---
wow you convinced me with your factual arguments! \s
---
SEADC
---
I don't think so tbh, SP farms are actually ppl who have trained their chars to a certain level and sell the excess SP now and then to cover the costs of plex.
---
This is not going to end.
---
flair checks out ...
---
Let me guess they probably outblobbed FRT 2:1 or 3:1
---
&gt; This is not going to end.
---
Thats what I said, these people will keep doing what they do, but the dedicated SP-Farm-Accs will be back and so more SP reach the market and Injector prices will be lower.
---
I will be keeping my hopes in check...
---
i would like to try to tackle vily on his wheelchair
---
going blue lack of air (enemies)
---
&gt;to people that don't get it WHY. Imagine yourself paying a lot of money for a very fast car. Month later company comes and replace your engine with worst one letting you drive at 1/20 of initial speed. Will you buy anything from this company again?
---
Mate, what? Nerfing overpowered things is a *normal and ongoing part of game balance* in all games.
---
I don't agree that the situation is hard because I don't believe that broken, overpowered things should remain untouched simply because people bought into them. That's an absolutely insane way to run an online game.
---
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
---
No.
---
I'd say not having local is the least of the problems people see in WH life
---
And you think the amount of lost PLEXed account will be made up by the amount of ppl paying directly? Taking into account the fact that CCP makes 25% more of a PLEXed account than by direct payment?
---
i deserve to be bullied for being afraid of wormholes. 
---
then again the one time i actually escaped one with my ship i was in 4% structure
---
Effect is rather small.
---
Think something like 4-5m isk / 500 plex.
---
I hope so, it certainly will make the jump less severe.
---
Ok but doesn't that make you think if lowsec would get love it would suddenly start to suck? Like better they leave it alone :p
---
i spent too much time not fighting nc. i guess.
---
agreed. only because you lack manpower or firepower and preparation doesn't mean other ppl do. A Nyx was takled, had a cyno...but the support couldn't use it due response time, and melted in under 2 minutes...I have to give the Initiative a credit for that.
---
So yes, you can kill a super or a Rorq with a cyno being on. 
---
There are always bigger sharks in tank. If you dont't wanna change that situation from your side, stick with your league - there is plenty renter space to go whaling. This is Eve and not a fair trade market. That is what we live for boy!
---
This is a few days out and the posted fits will work all good, but one thing you can also do is go to zkillboard and search a ship.  There will be the top pilots for each ship. You can check there to see if they've lost any of those so you can get an idea of what people do to tweak certain things.  Finding info there is really helpful, not just about ships but systems, groups, etc.
---
Cynojammers needs a buff maybe? Make it kill and burnout active cynos when it onlines?
---
Unfortunately In the last three years it looks like there was a 15-25% off Plex sale and 20% off MPTCs in Late July-Early August, and last year they did 15% for Black Friday, so it seems like if it takes that long to correct it's going to be affected by sales again before we see a correction.
---
Gallente-Caldari
---
tbf ishtar online was better then currents feroxs online. at least those required some SP to be effective
---
another fantastic big bill thread \o/
---
omg, I see you do not understand basic rules of the PLEX-ecosystem. 
---
Who do you think gives CCP money for that plexxed account? The guy plexxing or the guy selling this PLEX on ingame market ? These PLEX are already there and on the market, CCP has this money already when someone buys this PLEX to sub. If this plexxing guy cancels his sub CCP loses NOTHING but 1 subbed account in statistics, but no money. The sinking demand will lead to falling PLEX prices ingame, what will benefit people trying to PLEX 1 or 2 accounts without the need of having an additional 5-10-Account farm to get all the PLEX you need to sub them all. Maybe the sinking ISK-Outcome of PLEX will lead also to a decline in supply, but from my point of view as PLEX seller I can tell you that I sell the same amount of $ in PLEX today as I did 10 years back when I got arounfd 400 Million ISK for 500 PLEX.
---
As a twice-returning former 0.0 bitter-vet I confirm. The first return was into WHs with a few corpies. Fun for a month. Then EVERYONE quit. Second return - lowsec. 3 years zoomed past.
---
Enjoy all . Also really looking on feedback for this as this is a new one for me and would like to make more in the future with hopefully better quality cheers.
---
To whaling yes, but not to camping. Understand no matter what reddit says, it was the threat of force that made those people stay docked and drive down adms. Not the use of it. 
---
Now that is removed. Will it be more dangerous to some, sure. But its the equivalent to walking down a dark alley not knowing if anyone is there, or walking down a bightly lit alley with a rifle stock pointed out of the window at you.
---
What I'm reading is "I like FW, so everyone should do it". I love to do industry, you should do it or you're not enjoying the game correctly.
---
If you have some stockpiled, just hold onto it for December, it will go way up by then, but the same sale will probably happen on Cyber Day in November (late november).
---
Personally i misscalculated the drop in MPTC's and i ended up buying like 15 of them, gonna use them because each represents around 1.8m SP and as plex will go up in price, so will SP value in time, so little to nothing is lost. :)
---
I'm not saying they're bad, they just have a different skill-set.
---
Null has a lot of fleet ops and very few, if any, solo fights. Just finding a fight means leaving your vast and well defended territory unless you pop into a nearby wormhole or someone comes to you (in which case the whole intel channel knows and everyone piles on)
---
Things like heat management, cap management, and slingshotting go by the wayside in nullsec.
---
Don't worry about range dictation, just anchor up.
---
Don't worry about cap, the doctrine is cap stable.
---
And don't worry about theory crafting, they tell you what to fly.
---
Don't learn the map or make your own bookmarks, they'll do that for you.
---
Instadock, what's that?
---
BUT, I recognize that some high end players like null because that's the place to go to build doctrines, be an FC, fly a dictor, and do other things that lowsec lacks.
---
But if we're talking about small-gang and solo skills? There's thousands of nullbears who get by just fine without knowing the first thing about small gang or solo and the only bad ones in low-sec are new and will be pros much sooner out of sheer necessity.
---
I disagree completely.  If you are ratting and doing everything correctly there is almost no risk at all.  The people who get caught are the ones that don't pay attention.  If you are in a site that's not within dscan of a gate, and align out when a neut enters local, and don't sit at zero on the beacon, you are doing it the RIGHT way and will never get caught.  Will changes to the local chat in null hurt CCP in the long run?  It's entirely possible, but that's why they are testing this short term to start with and see what happens.  Botting and the massive amount of RMTing that comes with it hurts CCP as well.  Despite all of the doom and gloom from the pure bears and cowards, I think the worst thing that CCP can do at this point is nothing.
---
Don't bother learning about nullsec now.
---
There's a massive shakeup and everything valid now will be irrelevant soon.
---
This depends on that "blackout" thing, where null local chat is like wh local chat. And asset safety maybe too!
---
I bought 4 star packs as a new player, so when I saw everything tanking I held 6 of my MPTCs and 1350 PLEX, so I was hoping for a rise a bit sooner, but I think I'm just gonna HODL for a while.
---
While totally agree with you, the issue is that CCP still want people to inject into those ships.         
---
My point is that CCP cannot shuffle from one endgame thing to another if they want to maintain people willing to spend a lot of cash on the game.               
---
Like the issue is not with ships, but in the fact that you inject into those instantly.                  
---
I know that people forget about it - but for years supers / titans were not so big issue as it took years to get into them.            
---
While you could buy pilot from character bazaar - overall number of characters capable of flying those stayed the same.           
---
Now you can print new titan pilots on a daily basis - and CCP need to balance over this fact.        
---
Whatever will be the best - people will inject into it instantly ... and constantly.
---
PVP golem with salvager and tractor beam. Elite.
---
For major battles like br5rb only wouldnt be too bad
---
Lowsec gives players clear objectives without it being a theme park experience. Sadly CCP often forgets it exists!
---
And what, pray tell, do you think that guy BUYING the PLEX and selling it for ISK will do when he has (finally) sold that first batch? If demand is low and he will get less ISK for his money, while all other prices are rising because less is being produced because PVErs are less in number, do you think he will buy a new batch?
---
This is not only specific in a single aspect. A nyx can be killed in 10 seconds with 6 titans in that regard, or you can be an idiot and say cyno has no problema because a nyx can be insta popped by 12 titans. 
---
The matter that revolves around cyno is the aplication it has against small gangs and it encourages un-likeable game play. We were roaming a few days ago in 5 kikimoras and 2-3 tacklers and there cone a bhaalgorn with cyno +long web + neut + 200k ehp lights a cyno a 2 titans , 2 supers and fax came trough. This is not adapt or die. Roamers will roam less because of the game allows this. Game becomes boring and ppl unsub. More ppl unsub less roamers in your corner. And then even if you adapted. You die as well.
---
That browser was so helpful. I wish they bring it back someday.
---
&gt; Now that is removed.
---
how is it removed?  the camper is still there? even worse you don't know when he logs on and off anymore.
---
the guy is saying that cynos should reduce damage and mining so that ratters/miners get penalized for having a button that spawns a whole defense fleet directly on top of them. hes not trying to nerf hunters.
---
No.     
---
Specific player type enjoy the WH game play.          
---
**WH is not scary** it is annoying in many aspects ... and those aspects WH people love :               
---
* constantly shifting connections              
---
* ability to change connections          
---
* constant probing             
---
* constant dscaning            
---
* the blackout                   
---
* the whole cloaky gameplay
---
If you mean D-P - well, it's better than nothing, but still far from good.
---
You cared enough to reply.
---
Imagine not needing to because you don't get punished for botting =/
---
Tbh I don't know if this is considered botting.  I get that it'd be low on the priority list, but I feel like we're all supposed to be humans here.
---
&gt; but from my point of view as PLEX seller I can tell you that I sell the same amount of $ in PLEX today as I did 10 years back when I got around 400 Million ISK for 500 PLEX.
---
Cannot speak for all, but the guys I know and myself are not bothered by this.
---
Olmeca was talking about decreasing anom respawn times, forcing people to spread around their space, and then increasing ISK/hr, not just increasing null income on its own.
---
It's all about playing with the risk/reward equation so that it stays relatively the same. If you reduce the reward, you're going to have people take less risk, group up even more and roam less often. If you only increase the risk, people are going to change their behaviour to lower the risk (turtling up more, not logging in, etc.). If you both increase the risk and the reward, most people will continue their behaviour. Decreasing anom respawn times will force people to move out to get the increased reward that comes with it. If more ratters die to whalers, the null income should generally stay the same in exchange for an increase in whaler hunting.
---
Hey, come to us goons, we are the best. And I heard that we are beginner friendly, which is one of the reason why.
---
However, contrary to popular belief, you don't get a free supercarrier.
---
I know what he is saying, what i am saying is when our rorqs are on grid our hics and dics are cloaked near by, the cyno on the rorq is rarely used and is a last resort.
---
I joined a nullsec alliance 3 hours into EVE, now I have an alt I brought over but I kind of wish I used it to do low sec or WH space stuff. 8 months later null is kind of getting boring. I made like 10 bil mining and salvaging; only ever log in to check my timers for skill queue, fun game when we’re not sitting in station because there’s a stratios or a legion or something 3 jumps out and none of the 40 people in fleet want to do anything to it
---
This was vs BjornBee's public fleet last night, can find his perspective [www.twitch.tv/bjornbee](https://www.twitch.tv/bjornbee)   
---
He did keep getting ECMed, wasn't sure watching if it was burst jams or drones though. Looked pretty crazy fight wise, logi on the BNI side did well.
---
You would think that people would be super aggressive in such a cutthroat environment, but tbh lowsec has the nicest people I've met.
---
Imagine being in an in your face brawly ship, and still anchoring on your FC.
---
Thanks man! Didn’t even know that lol, will have to explore the SoundCloud shenanigans
---
Yes I’ve been getting this since switching to 64 but client. I thought it was a local internet issue but it would appear others are getting it too
---
Fun really is where you make it. If the people wanting small gang pvp would realize that null isn't where they are going to find it and go elsewhere, they might be happy. That's not a CCP issue, that's a player issue. Roam in with whatever, you are just going to get dropped on by supers/titans and blapped. Sorry its just how it is, and they are not going to play the "buff me nerf you" game.
---
However, you can go where the action is, and encourage CCP to put some time into it. I used to have a few titans, but found the gameplay (sitting around waiting for something) and gameplay of shooting structures boring. Waiting for a war just to shoot structures is boring. What I find more fun ? Suicide ganking with cheap ass ships. Sold off all my titans so I'm set for years of play without the need to even pay for a sub, no need to rat or mine. 
---
Don't let the impression that getting into something big will be "more fun" than what you can fly today at a cheaper level.
---
Jita - Smooth brain lost 90 billion ISK hauling PLEX and skill injectors in a shuttle. The masses cried, "RMT, " and linked the loss on Reddit 87 times.
---
Reread the 2nd paragraph again. Visible threat, is far far more effective in physiology then implied threat.  
---
Again whaling has been buffed, camping nerfed. One is active the other is passive. 
---
I like that EVE is moving to a more active requirement. We just need to understand the meta during this time has changed across the board. 
---
And in reality only bloops groups like bombers bar, and major alliances will be the big winners when considering null residents.

---
EvE is getting interesting again
---
Hell yeah!
---
My point is that you can't have **any** endgame ships that are better than everything else **and** have injectors. I agree injectors screwed everything up but there's no way CCP is going to remove them now. And  if the game were balanced properly they wouldn't be such a big deal. Nobody gets mad about people injecting into subcaps or mining barges for instance.
---
The problem is this capital class of "endgame ships" that were clearly designed for an era without injectors. They're the best at *everything*, whether it's defense, offense or mining, and that's a big problem. They need to be redesigned with far more tradeoffs, counters or some kind of niche role, like most other ships in the game. Then it doesn't matter anymore how many people inject into them.
---
Not at all. Way more to wormholes than no local and using dscan.
---
Create a new module that only JFs can jump to that ignore cynojamming. Tada.
---
most of the things are more expensive over there. If ISK is not a problem you will be fine. The one thing it comes to is fun. You can always drop a corp for another one until u find a right one. However it might be more difficult to get in bigger power block if u do so on regular basis. As always bigger is not always better. Power blocks require regular pvp participation from any member. You don't like pvp ? - there are plenty corporations would die for new member.
---
If you are in nullsec 15 jumps away from Didoxie, Rens or Hek you either need a local market, or corp logistic or simple you learn how to run subcapital logistic by yourself - it will be really handy further into the game.
---
oh huh, i've never tackled a rorq before that didnt use his own cyno. ive never heard someone mentioning moving their dic alt to where ever their rorq main is.
---
This link has a lot of details with common sense explanation: https://eveskillboard.com/guides/transfer
---
"On March 21, a dude in a cloaky Loki safe logged on a botting VNI's safe then logged back on and killed him. The bot later sent a death threat Eve mail."
---
this would just lead to the big blocks parking brick tanked cyno ships in systems, again bemefitting the small and especially the rorqs as they would just park a fax in the belt to act as cyno
---
Sick fight honestly. Surprised rails did that much work
---
Probably a sensor array.
---
Or a kickstand.
---
Did something change during my last haitus? Because this accurately described how cloaking worked last I checked. Regular cloaks don't allow you to do anything useful except be eyes and ears. A few specialized ships can fit covops cloaks and warp.
---
No, but we will see a rise in traffic in Osmon, Apanake, and Lanngisi.
---
Dude..... nice work!!
---
Nothing has really changed except the groups, and the groups make faction warfare fun. Started out with schneckt and damn was it fun
---
I do agree on many points you mentioned here, SPECIALLY regarding this major null sec heads NOT speaking for all the eve community, something that we must make clear for CCP!
---
I however have some reservations about drifters... For instance their capability tho insta kill Anything smaller than a capital ship on a ratting site! :(
---
But I'm willing to just sit and wait to see what else CCP is cooking to shake things up for the next couple weeks o/
---
We'll see how long you can sustain that then. It's your money. Bottom line will also be that less accounts to resub means less volume needed. PVPers usually don't have the same amount of accounts that industrialists do.
---
That was fairly recent though, would expect some time to utilize those MCTs or they'd be losing profit off the last cycle

kehjari all day
---
Sooo, you can become crazy good at this game in a fraction of the time it takes to get decent at WoW, or am I reading the axes wrong?
---
I forgot about all those small gang groups with 150 people roaming around. My bad.
---
Also no, you could not have killed a Rorq with a cyno being on, because at 2 minutes the panic is not even 50% through.
---
Also killing renters doesn't really hurt the big groups, they can always rent to someone else
---
&gt; didn't even used to be probes :(
---
Wow. no probes is before my time. I can't imagine Eve without exploration.
---
YOu are bad so other player must be bot. That a rethoric.
---
Yep. I’ve played for about 6 months and never done Faction warfare. I heard some info, I was interested as a way to make Isk and learn pvp (none of the pvp I had experienced up til now was consensual). 
---
I rolled a new character, took him into faction warfare two days ago. I’ve already pulled in nearly 100 million Isk and I just got my first kill! I was on a PLEX with an alliance member that I had warned about hunters. We got three frigs sliding the gate. He killed one, one warped off, and I kept the other one busy until he could take him out. 
---
I only did 11% of the damage but it was my first victory. I don’t know how I played for this long without checking it out. I love it.
---
You know a lot of people do intel by theyself right ? It's not beacause you're alliance are bot using other do that. Just check magic graphical about bot from CCP.
---
I can't watch this at work but in assuming it's an explanation of the lore of the gurista like how they formed, their fighting style etc? Will watch it later
---
Do angels next. Angel pirates best pirates
---
Yes but he could have free intel. So let give a way to find and kill they to
---
Botter who farm with avoid all risk of cyno cry beacause he must runs when defender cyno. 
---
RUN  baby RUN.
---
On July 10th, 4 entire fleets shot their fc.
---
1k battle, probably 1k view for the meme if pinged.
---
Worth it.
---
I haven't heard that name in so long.
---
I was in Morsus Mihi back then
---
RAWR forever!
---
Actually I got hooked into the game when I joined a Corp in npc nullsec. But it was a long time ago. We moved in low sec not long after and there I had my best time in the game in FW.
---
So I can only agree with you. Payout is nice. There are no blue donut. You can play with any ship you like. Logistic is not a nightmare even alone. Best place in the galaxy.
---
Content is there, you just need to find or create it.
---
Forcibly reducing the size of alliances will invalidate the idea of the sandbox. Not only that but the drama of the largest alliances and the fleet battles they have created are what put Eve on the map. reducing fleets to 50v50 will make Eve sorta meh.
---
I don't disagree that there's stagnation but I think forcing alliances to be small would be counterproductive. Elite PVP alliances (typically small) used to punch well above their weight class in spite of being considerably outnumbered. I'd like to see that happen again.
---
Is this a troll? Nobody seemed to contest this but I've been listening to Talking in Stations and the leaders on there who have been actively fighting drifters all say you can't Dscan them. Are they just crazy or is this an /r/woosh situation?
---
Because CCP totally knows what each and every individual joining the game would consider fun. 
---
I started back in ‘07, playing off and on, trying different things.  It wasn’t until ‘11, after starting a new character and giving science and industry a try, that I figured out what was fun for me.  
---
And you spend ISK on whatever supports the activity you enjoy doing.  
---
I understand there are people that are incapable of managing their day to day without someone standing over their shoulder telling them what to do, and those people should probably not play games like EVE, that require a minimum amount of initiative and common sense.
---
You have the intelligence of an ameba, the backbone of a jelly fish, HTFU if you want to take on Capitals and quit whining about cynos.  At least bring a little cheese to go alone with that whine.  TLDR, GIT GUUD.
---
If they are 500 and could DD , 200 M will be nothing.  actually 60 drifter could kill a fax in few time. 500 With DD ? 
---
And if you do that, you force 0.0 player to defend defend defend. So you will nto see any more war in 0.0 beacause people will be to busy to launch an offensive.
---
evidence? or are you just shitting through your mouth?
---
PvE content and ISK seems to be mostly just a means to an end. I think you need to decide on an actual goal. Eve Online appears to be more of a social sandbox than a directed game, so playing it like you would any other game and expecting it to reward you as such would probably bore the hell out of you.
---
No.... what he's saying is: Since it's difficult to find 50 people to flashform into harpies at a minutes notice, the three or four people online and active in standing fleet can get the job done by jumping in their caps. 
---
Not to mention, what they fuck are we even doing here? People tackle a fucking capital ship and then bitch when more capital ships jump in to save the capital ship. Got everyone yelling, "reeeeeeeee this isn't fair fuck u ccp game is ded eLiTe pVp" when no fucking shit asshole, what do you honestly expect?
---
CCP will interpret this as small ships being bridged or blops don't have internal jump drives so land +/- 100km while capitals with strong drives land directly on the cyno. RIP bombers.
---
Angel space trash. Glory to the Sansha’s Nation.
---
Yes yes, we can all see what you're read between the lines here and understand what you're really saying: 
---
"The real problem is that people don't play like I do."
---
Basically you want NPC to maintain 0.0 in defensive mode to avoid to deal with eventual coutner attack ? 
---
And some little entity have cry on reddit they can't roam any more beacause they must defend.  
---
Ho and drifter are not bot counter, beacause if human could avoid they bot could to.
---
He's full of shit. I can name exactly zero times someone kept a bubbler on/near grid with their own rorquals purposely. In a hundred rrorqual drops- not once was it the rorqual side that bubbled up first to keep the attackers from getting away.
---
Typical buff me, nerf them post. I want to kill supers/titans with my drake fleet but can't, so cry to CCP to fix.
---
**Reddit told me there was nothing to do in the game except PVP**, I believe it because it was upvoted.
---
Biggest hurdle for null players is the no local thing tho. With that being equal in both null and j-space, it will be a far less jarring a transition. 
---
I wouldn't be surprised if you start seeing more null traffic into j-space. Especially from relic hunters, as that will be a far more even risk now.
---
I can't stay in EvE because ican't find people to play with.
---
I can join TEST and become a drop in the ocean, or I can bounce through tiny orgs that either are useless, constantly at war, or just plain bad.
---
I have a very old character, I'm flying logistics (Did the level V logi for Incursion (WTM) but no one does incursions either.
---
Well frankly any titan can do 6,4au warp speeds and do 10 mwd pulse aligns.
---
I Do plan on angels next and don't worrie sasha sansha will follow soon after :)
---
Thanks for your valuable feedback: Your insults showed me how wrong I am.
---
Wanting to be able to attack a force of players 1000x larger than your gang in it's own home environment is going to have risks.
---
Look at t1 abyssals for isk, you should make a bit more money and have alot more fun doing it.
---
No, it literally IS adopt or die. In this literal, specific case, you adapt by not roaming there in a tiny gang of kikis. 
---
What you are really asking for is to be able to roam, completely risk free except for what you think you can fight. 
---
Just like the people you're hunting are really asking to just be able to krab, completely risk free except against what they can escape from.
---
I've had this problem on both fullscreen and fixed window (borderless fullscreen) and using both interval one and interval immediate.
---
Everything was going perfectly smooth about 2 weeks ago. I was able to enter Jita and even undock from Jita 4-4 without issue and holding solid 60 fps with 1800+ in system at times.
---
Now I can't even undock from our staging keepstar in R1O without my frames shitting the bed and my frame time skyrocketing...and there is roughly ~300 at times and something like 15-20 in immediate vicinity of our keepstar.
---
Can't even maintain 60fps/16ms even when out roaming by myself and I am only one in system without FPS constantly dropping to between 20-40 almost every other second.
---
This. Facwar needs some love that doesn't involve rail comets and mission bots.
---
I'll take a fax on grid in an ore belt with a cyno running the entire time people are mining for 500 Alex.
---
Yup
---
Everything was fine for me about 2-2.5 weeks ago. Smooth as butter.
---
Now undocking from our staging keepstar causes my FPS to drop, frame times to jump up and game is extremely choppy and stuttering.
---
 :(
---
So, if upon jumping to a cyno, for however that ends up working (there being a spool up time or not) ships appeared at the edge of the system and warped to the target cyno beacon... we would actually have some interesting gameplay. 
---
I still think combat jump ranges are too long and/or the red timer on combat ships is too short.
---
They couldn't even get local chat to work right for the longest time, and we expect them to get that to work ? CCP is to the point now it is all about needing to meet those financial goals or someone at the top is going to get axed.
---
I wish there was more to do in lowsec than just the current options (including FW). And maybe remove or nerf station and gate guns.
---
Maybe bring back passive moons to lowsec only, or something else of value to fight over.
---
Good stuff man. I gotta admit I know next to nothing about serpentis or mordus legion so they will be interesting too but awesome dude I like more stuff like this
---
:/ I put a load of my retirement isk into plex when it was at 4
---
At this point in the main blocs it is pretty much a requirement to have a fax alt when you have a super or titan. Aside from the fact that that fax pilot is probably also a rorqual pilot, nothing stopping that group from parking 1-2 faxes on grid with a permanent cyno running in an ore belt while people mine. You have no added a brick tank cyno that also can remote rep the rorquals on grid and are even less likely to lose things. Definitely what the hunters want to see.
---
https://youtu.be/CH1Q738UEsQ
---
Sansha are pretty cool I'll give you that. Much cooler than the dirty pretenders to the laser master race, the blood raiders
---
Only read the last line about best space.
---
&gt; Opening an info screen lags horribly
---
I've had this too. Also the upper left corner where system info and route info are sometimes lags horribly and doesn't load for like 10 seconds.
---
The problem here is that a lot of these complaints are made by groups that want to be able to take 5 or 10 of 15 dudes into enemy space with thousands of players and not have to face adversity to get kills.
---
OMG... Dude, if 16 jumps is an issue to you STOP PLAYING EVE!
---
I shit you not bro! This distance is basically nothing compared to the kind of distances one must take from time to time in EVE!!
---
Starting in a new group is a good example... You are staged in one place, they operate in another, and so a pilgrimage begins!
---
Really, 16 jumps isn't a big deal at all! o/
---
If It helps, eventually you will have access to ships capable of moving your fleets around to make your logistical much less painful, albeit remember the golden rule... "Don't fly anything you can't afford to lose" and you should be fine.
---
I have a better idea beacause you're idea is shit , you will just have everyonne with cyno alt near ready to cyno reinforce. 
---
Learn to hunt, really.  Cyno take 1 spot on the fitting, cyno consume fuel and make you can't move for 10 minutes. 
---
Basically you ask CCP to help you to counter every way defender have to protect they. 
---
Actually offender have: -choice of whent hey attack
---
\-Could be cloack and so "SURPRISE"
---
\-Could cyno they"re friend by pack of 200 and you're change allow they to do'nt be nerf by you're change.
---
Actually subcap farm is harder than capital and super farm for a big reason : subcap die before reinfroce fleet coudl come. Basically you ask to do the same for every ship.
---
Wanting a small gang of 10 dudes to be able to regularly and reliable dunk anyone they find in enemy space filled with a thousand dudes makes sense. /s
---
&gt; I understand there are people that are incapable of managing their day to day without someone standing over their shoulder telling them what to do, and those people should probably not play games like EVE, that require a minimum amount of initiative and common sense.
---
I understand that this game is "hardcore" and that you get a boner for excluding people and feeling elite but even you admit it took you 4 years to get into it. Anyway CCP is a business, it's in their interest to appeal to a wider playerbase
---
We go there every now and then to roam FW space, its fun. J-Space best space though.
---
Playing like I do requires a lot of self-hatred. It's not for everyone.
---
yos plees

&gt; As announced on July 5th, in 48 hours, at downtime on Friday, July 12, local chat across all nullsec space will be switched over to delayed mode. This means that it will behave as local chat in wormhole space, with pilots only appearing in the local population listing should they choose to post messages.
---
&gt; When this change comes into effect, pilots will not appear in the local population listing or population count unless they choose to make themselves known by posting a message in local chat.
---
&gt; The duration of this blackout is undetermined, and we’ll be monitoring what effect this has on the cluster.
---
&gt; [If you’d like to discuss this announcement, feel free to do so in the comments thread here.](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/local-comms-blackout-discussion-thread/171935)
---
It's beacause of giant blob of 150 people a lot of people farm in cap and in rorqual. Just to have a hope to receive reinforce in time. 
---
You want golden ammo.
---
How bad are you in this game zkillbrain ?
---
Realistically expecting half to all of delve to swap from excavators to t2 mining drones.
---
Its more than that.
---
"The real problem is that people don't play HOW I WANT THEM TOO".
---
Getting out shipped is part of the game and it happens at every level. Even at novice FW.
---
In tristan: omg why are there no t1 ships to fight
---
In t2: omg why are there no t1 ships to blow up
---
To win, someone clearly has to lose, and expecting people to let you win EASILY is comical.
---
I was super hype when they redid the exequtor, that thing was fugly as well
---
It was removed because the concept of a ingame jukebox is patented by a 3rd party and they would have to licensing fees to keep the jukebox ingame or fight the patent in court.
---
Another yes here, I'm using the 64 bit client.
---
THIS IS NOT A DRILL

Ooooo yeee babyyyyy

&gt; oh man they're all in a PLEX

It’s a feature. “Drifter Delay.”

Golde ammo pleaze CCP. Beacause you are to bad at this game. Niot you're fault you are a zkillbrain who can't play in team with organisation so you want CCP remove all organisationt ool  fromp the game.

Set warp drives to hype. All those that unsubbed can I have your stuff?
---
Here we fucking goooooo!!!!

finally, fucking nullbears about to get their shit kicked in
---
It consistently goes down then recovers in a few months even higher than before.

I want to believe all of them would, but I know better.

Botters already adjusting their programs to have ingate scouts relay a docking command upon seeing a hostile landing on gate.

Good luck everyone.

---
Olmeca and the copy cats are gonna have a damn field day. Dude has his down.
---
Only if it's in Tama or flying stuff you can drop Rorquals on. FW content is generally cruiser and down.
---
Yeh same man was shocked when I searched youtube there a very few lore videos about so figured I would make some :)
---
The more I think of, the more i agree on the idea of the bhaalgorn (or any other OP ship atm) being nerved being able only to fit a cynofield for bridging subcaps...at the same time it won't work. You simply a need bridged frigate being able to fit a cyno for capital bridging for circumstance that. At this time you can limit the bridged type to certain ship category and nerf they ability to brigde capitals... I'm certain a lot of players are not ok with that. Nerfing some ships being able to equip a cyno can be circumstanced - covop frigate with regular cyno on it. So you need the nerf covops starting with frigates and ending with Battleships.
---
Does it fix the situation - maybe. But at what costs? The next step Blackops pilots complaining about not being able to bridge bigger ships if needed and being no fun to utilize and completely useless and threaten to cease their existence. 
---
Either way any changes you come up with will hurt more than do good.
---
It would be a shame if someone were to just log in a lachesis in their system or take a wormhole into system instead.
---
If I'm being honest, I'm less concerned about theft. Theft can be scouted and slowed down with bubble forests, at least. Bombers, OTOH, cannot be scouted or slowed down at all. Covert cynos are extremely powerful with no local.
---
Nooo fucking way, another Running With Knives dude! I was with them at the time when they wrre still talking about moving to null, titan fund pledge and all. Gee whiz, it's been a while.
---
I agree even tho i was 4 mounth old that times , flying with Scourge was the best year of my Eve career , even tho fleetcom was screaming at everyone that hasn't money or skills for good ships , but he  exselent fleet commender  .
---
its happening dot gif
---
I guess you could also say that the bean is G E M I N A T I N G
---
Please tell me how launching 5 drones and doing something else for 20 minutes is hard.
---
Also I did not say anything about taking away cynos, just decreasing the amount you can farm when you do, same calculations can be made for 
---
* core defense field extenders/armor pumps vs hyperspatials
---
* cloak
---
* tank vs tracking/drone damage amps
---
* bulkheads vs drone mining rigs
---
I am also fine with people dedicating an alt for a cyno to not be affected. People who do not have a home defense fleet ready all the time to jump/bridge on them do not have a cyno fitted anyway, so they are also not affected.
---
In big fights it can actually happen that a capital without a cyno fitted bounces off the in-cyno and can not light a cyno for the next fax wing (can ofc be solved with removing the cyno after the in-jump, which takes time though and is not possible if you aggress the moment you cyno in)
---
I have two bridgers, a bomb truck and 5 bombers. I'm pretty sure I will go insert said squad somewhere and cloak up for an hour or two and come back and harvest all of the drones because.. invisible.
---
The allure of FW used to be the constant frigate and cruiser content. It wasn't the one fight a night/week between two huge fleets. It was the dozens of fights every day.
---
SLYCE Procurer on dscan
---
If all you're doing is losing T1 frigates and Cruisers than FW income is plenty to sustain yourself.
---
Would help if they put a time stamp on the post.
---
BUT MUH YIELD
---
This is obviously fake news. Everyone knows, according to reddit posts, rorquals are invincible and never die.
---
looks like a bug to me, report to CCP
---
Somewhere between your logic and your grammar
---
because honestly thats alot of effort for a VNI
---
BRB, resubbing
---
10 bombers can basically instapop an excavator cost effectively with no possibility of stopping them if they come in off Dscan. Going to be a very good time for excavator killers.
---
[Hell...](https://youtu.be/_J6-3l3hCm0)
---
Did you have police skins?
---
Obviously what we need is for PANIC to protect excavators. :unsmigghh:
---
Fw
---
Nice part about faction FW is 12 minutes in offensive novice gets est. 5mil ISK. MY ships are only 10mil right now as a noob so I never have to worry about going broke since I am looking for pvp while I plex.
---
Loki and Bait domi ready to go :D
---
I'm all for this change but I just think the grand log off will commence and the krabs will not log back in again till it's over. It will just be the hunters vs the hunters rather than the hunters vs the prey.
---
Thx all for your feedback....much appreciated
---
Definitely need to see some new blood CEOs and FCs to make faction warfare fun- faction cruisers and supers are better left for dunking nullsec.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpozzBSmwX8
---
&gt;No you provide reasons to stray outside the umbrella.
---
Thats what nuking anom spawns will do, make you travel to find anoms.
---
Dodixie has most everything you would need.  It may cost a little more than Jita, but it's usually worth it to save you the 12 or so extra jumps to Jita.  There's 1k less people in Dodixie local than Jita, which makes it much better than Jita.
---
My guess is that the nullbears will fight back and kill you..
---
The hardest part as a noob is not being able to realize what other frigates seen on dScan are going to wreck you without a hope.
---
Spoiler: you lose about 85% of 1v1s. Throwing your ship in for experience is fun. But staying alive is more fun.
---
Lowsec stuff doesn't get PCGamer articles made about it. Why spend time on it ha
---
Same.
---
Morsus Mihi, wasnt that Vuk paying his mansion with 29$ for 1 Bil ISK on ebay?

Let the games begin

RemindMe! one month
---
I'm not sure. People merely will wait it out. My activity relies on pure afkness and carelessness, which I want to believe be less of a factor with no local. I expect my isk hour to be lower
---
time to list all those combat recons that I stocked up with on the market!!
---
also huggin needs a PG buff, ccplz
---
But mah heritage!
---
Hunters vs hunters sounds fine to me
---
I see this differently.         
---
You can have end ships if the space you have is balanced.         
---
Look at rorquals , supers, titans and then think about them again assuming those points :                        
---
* FW space is perma cyno jammed, capitals cannot also use gates in the area. (inability for them to exist in the area can be also introduced)  ^(you have area when sub capitals matter, no normal cyno drops are possible even with subcaps)                   
---
* Few sov nullsec regions disallow capitals from using jump drives in the same way - but you can use gates.  ^(totally different gameplay with the use of capital ships)                
---
* Smuggler gates no longer allow travel of supers and titans ^(aka you cannot move your titan from delve to fountain or from Catche to The Spire using 1 gate - stuff shakes a lot ... now if you extend this to capitals - ripples are getting much bigger. You can control less space but you are getting safer ... are you -&gt; next point )                       
---
* Each region needs to be reachable from NPC space AND connected to npc space by gate. If this is NPC space all respective stations get bonus similar to T1 rigged smallest EC possible. (to be precise if station is shipyard, capitals can be build like in T1 rigged azbel, and subcaps like in T1 rigged raitaru in terms of cost - speed can be lower) ^(you are vulnerable to dread bombs and groups that decide to live in NPC space near you can actually build stuff in NPC stations that you cannot touch )                 
---
* 'Nursery' areas. NPC space is seeded with like 20 remote pockets of very small sov systems (1-3 systems) poor but allowing small groups to live there. They are unreachable from other sov area.  ^(places where small groups can grow and compete for, if this will be like 20j from nearest sov and at least 3 mids away no big block will bother)                            
---
Summarizing:     
---
*  you get safe lowsec space for new and small groups playing in FW, place were you never see a capital ship or subcapital hotdrop.          
---
* you get bunch of small pockets small groups can fight for and develop. Simply not worth the effort or any big block.                                          
---
* Sov where subcapitals matter as capitals cannot jump ... but as they can be used tactics are totally different       
---
* Smuggler gate limiting your reach with supercapital forces        
---
* NPC areas allowing hunting and dread cache construction without ways for blocks to block this ability.

Spot on for the new player null experience. Jump 47 times for a lagfest and clicking F1 every now and then, or join standing fleet and sit in almost complete silence for an hour.
---
Weird flex leaking nc general chat, but okay. We have our fair share of people who don't know what they are talking about
---
&gt; If some love would be put towards NPC Null in terms of more ways of making isk
---
Blazing / Burners are a pretty damn good way to generate isk. Limits your region choice a bit but still.
---
Praise Bob in his glorious bloodlust! Our scouts gonna have the time of their life.
---
Actually, according to reddit posts are not dying *enough*.
---
Oh good, I have a decent stack of certain compressed ores in Jita, hopefully we will see some price bumps in the coming weeks.
---
I didn't fund that. 
---
I found the biggest issue was that most of my game sessions were taken up with scanning, rather than actually playing.
---
Local was the least of the issues.
---
I think this will be the case as well, once the few idiots that don't pay attention to anything are killed off, along with a number of bots. The smart ones have either changed their game or will just ride it out. It still won't change hunters getting blobbed by supers/titans in any of the big blue donuts if they drop on anyone with two brain cells and a cyno.
---
My PI sustains all of my accounts. I'll be one of those people not putting a single pve asset in space to mine or rat during black out. Even if it's indefinite. I can agree that you might take a hit for now as a lot of peoole pull back. With the power balance shifting, I would rather be the hunter 100 %. This weekend is going to be a bloody harvest.
---
Can I make new accounts.  Take advantage of the bonus SP for referall,  skills them into some niche role for a month and then sell those skills to my main?
---
Well, that's simply because if even one of them survives being attacked and dying to the group that obviously deserves the killmail.. then it's not ok.
---
Can you visit Stain again.      
---
It is this time of a month where moons rocks are cracking and rorquals are showing up again.            
---
Thx
---
Would help if you actually read the announcement....
---
" at downtime on Friday, July 12 "
---
Also check your local market.
---
Example: Eve University, the local market and Corp contract market was normally very well stocked with tech 1 and 2 stuff and there was a couple of people that would do shopping services for more uncommon stuff. Price difference was nominal and worth not having todo it myself. Been a few years but I doubt it’s changed that much.
---
Blackout will continue until activity improves
---
&gt; dearly needed to safe the EVE economy
---
Are you sure you studied? ;)
---
&gt;If plexxed PvE-Accounts unsub, the direct financial loss for CCP in the first state is ZERO, as people subbing with PLEX pay no money to CCP.
---
Not that I'm in favor of botting but PLEX funded accounts create demand for guys like me who buy PLEX and sell them for ISK when the need arises. Sorry if I'm out of line. I understand you're a studied economist and you know demand is an unnecessary condition in a healthy market. Carry on. :)
---
I think there is more hype about this than what will actually really happen. Most likely some of the "Null Bears" will return back to where they came from in hi-sec, and everyone one settle back down, once they realize it is not that big of a deal.
---
yea they're ancient history now, huh? A lot of them are still bumping around in lowsec now. I wish I could remember the group off hand, but they were decently big players in low when the whole WWB thing was going down. Some moved to black legion but, well you know how that went.
---
[Nullsec ratters be like...](https://media.giphy.com/media/14fnBD3MQslIGc/giphy.gif) 
---
Looking forward to seeing all the obvious bot killmails this weekend.
---
Covert Cyno bois about to have a field day
---
This blackout either goes really good or really bad with everyone turtling more the anticipation is killing me
---
same, been on loads of BB fleets and never seen that.
---
So bad that small null groups are fading away , I was actually having a lot of fun fighting literally everyone in Pure Blind and Curse . But yeah lowsec is acrylic better for small scale , because recently I was roaming with my 4 friends and basically got dunked by literally everything but it was hell of fun , the thing we actually want from any games .
---
My body is ready!
---
Judging by Excavator killboard - Delve losses are minimal to zero. 
---
TEST loses Excavators regularly though.
---
Good luck finding each other with no local
---
Neither of them are looking for a fight, though. Just free kills on ratting cruisers.
---
I bet like 80% of people will try to mine with T2 mining drones while still having excavators in the drone bay or cargo.
---
I double dog dare you
---
yes people will play a different game if they cannot mine.........
---
I think you're right. Most reasonable people will want to pvp and keep their krabbing alts logged off. The unreasonable will ree and ree and ree all the way home to high sec.
---
Oh I really want to go, but it's my brother's birthday right in the middle of that.
---
Probably. But a rorqual with a cyno is safe, a deployed excavator is not.
---
I got my kicks as a newer pilot by learning WH exploration the hard way. Saw one, didn't know what it meant, went in with a little frigate. Made my first billion wandering and finally learning how spooky space works and how one Alpha dude can make a billion ISK in a day as long as the skeletons don't get you.
---
**Prepare for the great content blackout of our time** 
---
Please reference this message one week into the blackout as to why you can't find anything to shoot. This PSA will now repeat.
---
You only see the kills.   If they are booshed and stolen... You see nothing.
---
Yay! We are all going to die!
---
Wormholers not doing math? Preposterous!
---
The only reset that is even possible would be for them to start a 2nd server. Now that isnt the worst idea but I could see issues.
---
Fucking hope not!
---
yep, time to move my plexed accounts over to CC, or at least the ones I can afford to move
---
Well we can't have any risk exist to a cloaked ship, those pvpers complain enough as is, imagine if there was any risk while being cloaked? THE HORROR
---
I thought if you were in one at DT you just got podded?
---
speak for yourself
---
&gt; But if you really think that non-combatants don't take risks
---
I think what he's saying is that BOTs take no risk. Where I have to be paying close attention to intel and local when I rat or mine, a bot is constantly scanning that data and can react far more quickly than I can, especially if I'm being dumb and watching a movie on Prime.
---
FAKE EDIT:
---
I see he's actually saying ratting is 100% safe. While he is technically right that if you are doing everything correctly (like a bot does) you'll be safe but most of us aren't that robotic. I've lost more ships to my wife distracting me than I like to admit.
---
A+ for the video! Keep doing God’s work.
---
For sure, but now there's one less difference (and it's a major one).
---
Everything but a large is already blocked off to caps. I don’t really see the need for system wide cyno inhibs - at least in the amarr/min wz
---
But when will the Celestis/Arazu/Lachesis get some love? :P
---
Then why are you not having cargo full of PLEX while moving in your travel ceptor ?
---
Lol, would be trash. But you know how they implement! I would love to see a little more cyno counter play like a scattering field module that makes people coming in through a cyno deviate and/or land staggered (delayed exit of cyno).
---
then we will get roaming gang v roaming gang. content is content even if it is you that is made content.
---
I think there will still be ratting cruisers to kill, ill just have to get faster at scanning them
---
That's where you're mistaken. A good fight is exactly what they want.
---
Yes and no. It's been legally established from other mmos I believe that we do not own our accounts pur subs are just paying for access to them. Can they wipe yes would it make sense no the negative impact would hurt them a lot.
---
last time i tried it out was 1.5 to 2 weeks ago and it still worked.
---
Because you can magically teleport plex.
---
ignorance is bliss?
---
out of sight, out of mind?
---
everybody knows the systems are camped.  people will get dropped one by the camper.  if you choose to just ignore the camper, then fine, but that is the same situation we are in now.  the only difference is that the camper doesn't even have to be logged on now to still have an effect.  
---
There is no additional active requirement.  If anything, bots will rein more supreme.  Any sort of sub cap ratting is out the window unless you are in a cheap ass ship.  Nobody is going to rat in a rattle or mach or anything else that can be easily killed by a camper / dropper.  So it is cheap drone bots all the way down.  Which, because of the low ticks, are best used with a botting program.
---
No it isn't, or they wouldn't be hunting ratters to begin with.
---
*Laughs in cloaky t3*
---
I'm coming to kill you dead
---
HAPPENING STATUS: IT'S.
---
Fair enough, TIL
---
We need more stories like this in this sub. You go, Sprinkle_Boy!
---
FeelsAmazingMan
---
CAN'T LOSE!
---
This is not a test of your emergency broadcast system, this is the real thing!
---
No, he's rightly pointing out that if you can bring 100 capitals and the other side can only bring 50 then you've already won. That doesn't happen with subcaps because they've got a myriad of tools to use against each other that can overcome a numbers advantage (ewar, booshing, bombing, counter comps, kiting etc). 
---
So basically, you bring more capitals, you win by default. At all levels of PVP, from solo roaming all the way up to sov wars, like we've just seen in the north. Not a single meaningful battle was fought because the side with more caps would win by default, and everyone knows it.
---
Who said I was? Everyone knows all the best Alliances have identified as gay for years.
---
Personal predictions;
---
The first week will be known either as the "LOWEST COUNT WEEK" over the lack of people logging OR the "SALTYEST WEEK" over major alliances getting so bitchy over it that they will ended fully focus on burning down HS... blaming it for everything that is actually their own fault!
---
I wish however to be wrong, and this actually generates a lot of good content and the biggest fights ever seen in Eve o/
---
Either way I have my minerals sitting in Jita to make use of this rare opportunity... Fuck rorquals!!!!
---
Just as easy as they can be camped they can imagine they are not. Trust me this is not a theory, look at wormholers. People learn to operate inspite of the fear when there is a bigger roll of the dice the person is not there. 
---
But in the end, people will just gravitate to the mega alliances, fit a cyno to everthing and no longer care.
---
No...
---
I wouldn't say it's major at all, majority of the people in the big corps/alliances don't even watch local/intel.. why bother when you can have programs ping you instead. Maybe I'm so used to not using local I've forgot what its like
---
Fewer Krabs will log in. Good luck finding them.
---
I loved roaming in lowsec and doing FW, but those areas are dead when I'm playing. I'd either have to jump on as soon as I got home from work or wait til 12-1 am. Need more CST people!
---
Hey, people will be shooting people instead of some docking up before you even reach their system and the others just flying around empty system, I already count it as a win no matter who wins the fight.
---
Boo fuckin hoo  
---
Because in wormholes its impossible to find content ^s
---
introducing the Excavator Advanced Safety Expedient, also known as the EAS-E button, a new product that provides complete invulnerability for mining drones at the expense of 5 plex per cycle
---
they should add a spotify module that you need to fit in order to get music in your ship
---
I will agree that null is the most fun as FC or tackle. Otherwise it's some variation of F1 and after the first few fights that lost is sheen. FW has (had?) a lot more opportunities to actually *pilot*.
---
This argument is really fucking dumb. If you regularly roam nullsec you would know that harassing their ratters and miners is one of the absolute best ways to get a fight.
---
Time to move cyno 5 on top of the skill queue.
---
Then fill it with omega slave implants
---
They are normally boosted away then sold back to people.   This is a far better business model.
---
nobody gives two shits about the camper himself.  he probably doesn't even have any offensive capability.  The big oh shit (and also why everybody docks up when even a frig enters the system) is fucking cynos.  Which of course wormholers don't have to deal with.  If all i had to do was watch a gate or two to figure out what was coming to kill me, i'd rat in a blingy ass whatever all the time.  It is the cloaky bomber that is going to push two buttons and the 50 friends of his that are going to instantly appear and kill me. 
---
anyways, i don't expect the experiment to last.  pve players won't log or undock. hunters will get bored as shit of dscanning / probeing and finding empty systems.
---
So many people hyped for this. I'm just waiting for it to be "just another thing" that happened.
---
That’s great, thanks
---
Man avoid highsec corps, they aren't fun in all honesty. Eve Uni is the place to go to really learn mechanics and they genuinely want to teach.
---
It's at least a reasonable way to kill botters that doesn't require too much autism (for an eve player), which means people will do it.
---
!Remindme 1 week
---
&gt;lands in a bubble with a billion cans around it, gets decloaked
---
Get out of here with your hard truths
---
That jacket was at Target, most are online from Opposuits or Shinesty.
---
The catch is no police to intervene if someone wants to shoot at you, which they most definitely will regardless of whether you're in a Corp or not.
---
If you want to try out null with a highsec base before plunging in, I'd advise basing in Orvolle and learning mechanics in Syndicate NPC null rather than Sov null. It's not far from Dodixie and not too far from Jita. The pipe into null can be hairy depending on time, but that'll just help you learn to avoid gate camps.
---
Now that's a interesting idea!
---
This is gonna be fun.
---
That makes a lot of sense. The first MMO to hook you is always the best. I had already been in EVE and played most other MMOs before PotBS. I followed it in dev for a long time, then when it launched I was severely let down. It had some good concepts, but the overall execution was very poor.
---
Saltyest?
---
It's 2 different environments. I've been to both and I have to say that Vegas isn't really that special. But I'll do alittle break down for u.
---
Vegas:
---
Very focused on separation of groups. The panfam stay with their people, imperium  with theirs and so on. The event will flow but you never really seem like your all there together as one. This isn't to say there isn't any, people meet up and chat but the main groups do their own thing most of the time. The event itself is the same just about anyone you go to. Tho I'm a swag junky and Vegas as the event never really delivers. The community tho, I walked across the room in 2016 and the time I got to the other side I had stickers on my ass, back, chest, some people give pins and got some coins and poker chips from groups. Will you enjoy urself?  Yes,  you have to go out of ur way not to.
---
Iceland: 
---
This will be just as pricey, most of the time more, then Vegas just depends on if u share a hotel with people. The 2 years I went I spent about 2-3k US, but I wanted the full experience when I go. I go to the main sites, drink until I drop kind of shit. The event is always the best tho. The space is amazing, very inviting. People are very intermingled with other groups. Tons of swag, tons of cosplay going on. Just it won't get better then this. Again like any properly run event for eve. You have to really go out ur way to not enjoy urself. I do strongly recommend flying in the day before the event and leaving the day after the event. It gives you time to go hit up the hot springs and a few of the other very touresty things to do. 
---
Just my 2 cents. I've only been to 3 Vegas and 2 Iceland tho. And it's been a few years since my last Iceland.  Other events I would really think about too is EVENorth,  they hit a home run in their first event. Also the NYC monthly meet ups are always a ton of fun.
---
Stahp it
---
You know what I would really like to see to make this (much appreciated) change truly significant?
---
It would be Cynos INTO wormholes from any place in EvE where you are actually able to light a cyno. 
---
The cyno could be governed by the current mass of the hole, in its present state, and it would have to be lit within 150km of the entrance hole that the hunter chooses.
---
A bit of something for everybody then eh?
---
K
---
Hahaha yes John!
---
MY BODY IS READY
---
Never not engage.
---
Here we go.
---
never not bite in the procubait
---
Fucking balls! YEAAAH!
---
I love the irony that the cheese used by these big coalition, timezone tanking, is backfiring full force with the drifters.
---
Better maintain that wh control, when null is wh space, our scrubs are going to get a lot better fast.
---
Sure just make that replace PANIC and we'll kill your rorq instead.
---
In that case, I hope the blackout will be permanent
---
Honestly I wonder if the narrative of "new players go join a null sec corp ASAP" didn't happen. Maybe it was inevitable that it will happen nonetheless but I wish there was at least a period of time where lowsec FW would be the newbie go-to rather than nullsec. I mean huge fleet battles with TiDi are nice and all, but what hooks people are the constant content.
---
One of these two posters plays eve, can anyone guess?
---
Mobile Scan Inhib, bubbles and as many boson titans as you can fit in a 30km radius :)
---
Just in time for the weekend :O
---
Mr Smartbomb would like to know your location
---
*WAAAHOOOOOO*
---
You mean less krabs and only people willing to fight around? What's not to like?
---
Its all about creating your own markets
---
Well one of your predictions has already come true: Goons have already been talking about burning down high-sec.
---
Tho that was in response to the drifter stuff, not this.
---

---
Problem solved.
---
Wonder how many sneaky dread caches will get repositioned (and/or used) during this.
---
ah ah, that's hot.
---
I think both sound fun... I'd have no problem ratting away with a standing fleet.  Springing a trap is just as fun as hunting and you get to make money while you wait
---
&gt; Are you sure you studied? ;)
---
Not foreign languages
---
&gt; understand you're a studied economist and you know demand is an unnecessary condition in a healthy market. Carry on. :)
---
You know that not only PvE-Multiboxes consume PLEX, but also casual players that want to fly spaceships with 1 or 2 accounts without having to instal a PvE-overhead of 5+ Accounts just to farm the ISK for all this PLEX ? Or old PvP-Players or filthy rich Goons wanting to buy all the Skins for their Titan so they can flex on undock? Also you know that demand can be unhealthy high so the prices skyrocket (lets say by 150%) so that the casual guy wanting to plex is out of the game and the PvE-Overhead needed to finance all the accounts gets bigger and bigger, fueling the price effect further moere? 
---
Sincerely, do you really know what to look at tuo understand an economic SYSTEM ?
---
Very similar situation.  I still hang with most of my friends I've made in FW when I first started playing 10 years ago.  We tried null sec for 5 years  but even then, we still came back to low sec for pvp on the weekends.  I left null sec and quit for a year.  Came back in December and joined a low sec alliance with a great group of bros in the same area in Black Rise where I first started.   Been having a blast since I've been back.
---
Roooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrr!!!! Fuck local! Game on bitches!
---
You should fire whoever taught you English.
---
The cruisers at the medium at very beginning were fighting each other, and you guys halted a really good fight. I was in that myrm
---
Im a new guy so can someone explain me why this change is happening and why?
---
Balance is being restored to the Force
---
Oooh this guy gets it
---
Maybe... here’s a wild one... that we incentivize by shaking the resource allocations?  
---
The problem is not local chat... super umbrellas... any of that player behavior.  The problem is a lack of conflict over resources. 
---
Sutonia it’s really disappointing to me that you being on the CSM isn’t more aware of this as the central issue.  Tells me that you probably weren’t the best representation.
---
So you just report /u/eveasher and be done with it. It's how PL rolls anyway.
---
i confirmed i did it this weekend
---
What a great birthday present this is for me.
---
So curse or strats  boys?
---
I know someone that bought 70+ injectors at 1b :D
---
Thank you holy space jesus!
---
Indeed, they have been TALKING about it! 
---
But so far, at least as far as I know... No major strikes against HS have been done by the bees so far!
---
Your first sentence generally describes lowsec.
---
It still isn't very great.
---
I actually might resub because of this
---

This sums up my emotions at this announcement.
---
Filthy casual
---
FRT was out numbered. But they where in battleships with fax logi and sitting on their fort. Vs cruisers
---
lol... deleted his comments.
---
What an idiot.
---
&gt; You're clearly the kind of sick fuck who'll enjoy it.
---
Probably.
---
Most interesting... That is definitely a good sigh!
---
Unironically, delayed local might be the only thing saving highsec
---
Thank you, Dunk, for being as transparent as you can be. I appreciate it and I know others do too, even if this thread has attracted more than the usual percentage of salty bitches.
---
Keep up the good work, don’t get banned, etc.
---
They are welcome to try.
---
Dude there’s literally no creativity being suggested.  It’s just shit on null alliances for playing the game ccp made.  Fuck us right.  
---
And then ccp doesn’t have a clue “how to fix it” because they don’t even understand the root of the problem.
---
Holy shit
---
Personally, I feel like this is a good thing, but what about you guys?
---
Well, you should dump your stock before others dump their stock so you sell them higher
---
Just make it so only certain ships like recons  can even fit them. Like back in the good old days.
---
The Drifters disrupt the MacGuffin and therefore CONCORD (CCP, really) is deactivating Local in Nullsec.
---
I thought they had patched that! 
---
Those are good news indeed o/
---
God, it is so tempting to resub now.
---
[ERE WE GO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohHA8bP7CMY)
---
I saw that jacket at Target and automatically thought of you.
---
Sooooooper legit.
---
Yeah, that was big. Starting background and school and shit could give you 50k or 500k+ sp depending on how you stacked them too, iirc.
---
Hardcore has nothing at all to do with thinking that CCP can tell each and every person what would be fun for them.  
---
You can start developing a deeper understanding of why saying something like CCP needs to do a better job of telling new players what is fun, by looking up, reading, and comprehending the word subjective. 
---
It didn’t take me “4 years to get into it”.  It took time for me to learn that something I didn’t think I would enjoy was actually the thing I enjoyed most about EVE.  I simply overlooked it because I didn’t think building things would be fun, based on previous experience in other games.  
---
CCP can’t tell you what you would find fun, you need to explore every part of the game and figure it out for yourself.  
---
Now here’s the really amazing part, there’s a fucking tutorial for just about everything.  If someone doesn’t have the patience to go through them, they probably don’t have the patience to stick with the game over any extended period of time.
---
It's not about wormholers, just wingspan being wingspan. Especially since he was new to the game.
---
And a cloaky t3c following ratting caps for defence. For 1000
---
Yeah, this will maily be a blessing for Wormholers and AFF-Cloaky Campers. Everyone else will be reported at Gates.
---
Hey, I have no problem sitting a cloaked sabre on a poco either.
---
You really have absolutely no idea what you're talking about, do you?
---
Idk man, if you read this sub long enough it sounds like you're not going to get a fight, just a bajillion trillion super duper op supers dropped on you in less than a second.
---
If you want to wait for the weekly intervals to catch one, sure. I have dozens of spare epithals. Have fun waiting for that specific 10 minute block of time per week.
---
So very bad if you have only insult as answer.
---
You are so so bad dude...
---
   
---
Peace to Eve is cruel
---
Scan those sigs and crit those holes. Problem solved.
---
I have no idea if this is going to go well or not, but I can't wait to find out.
---
Just change the modules. No weapons on supercaps. They buff wings and thats it. Titans on grid buff everything about the subcaps in fleet. Mom's buff drone damage. Dreads buff dps.
---
Resubbing sends a message
---
Lowsec bestsec, and even with CCP's continual disregard for that part of the world. FW was a good step, and adding simple things like the sec status bounty things only available in lowsec rats was another good step. We need way more of that. There is absolutely no reason you should be able to make more money in complete safety in highsec. Lowsec needs more stuff unique to it to draw the populations
---
One of the only ways*
---
So you must admit you're idea is fucking bad actually. Stop cry and learn to hunt. Kill people are not hard. But just stop to ask CCP to make the game unplayble for 90% of player. 
---
Beacause i thinka  lot of people will not  want ot have more alt. And if they do it ? Plex price will sky rocket and more tears will be collect.
---
PLEAZE use you're brain before post "awsome idea HOLOL"
---
Mlyp
---
Dont forget other mechanics like gate mechanics is diffrent in wormholes, system effects and no assets safety.
---
&gt; they added in a decent tutorial, the agency window, removed learning skills, and a whole pile of new features which really made the learning curve comparable to a lot of other MMOs. Eve isn't particularly difficult to get into now. Most people still won't enjoy it, but it's not hard.
---
Well... Not really. It's still alot harder to actually accomplish something than in other games. And the permanent loss mechanic is also alot harsher to new players, which simply doesn't happen in other games
---
[An older Meme](https://i.imgur.com/gXxBPo6.jpg)

Tama is dead compared to a year or 2 ago, I've moved DSTs with 1b+ cargo through Nourv/Tama gate at least 15 times in past 6 months. At least half of them I didn't even bother scouting. #TeamTama died with PERUNGA.
---
Or, you know, actually populate and defend space you "own"
---
Cloaky campers cant do shit to people that work together and aren't afraid to fight
---
The only use that massive alliances have is causing the massive battles that put eve in the news. You aren't doing that anymore, so yea I'd rather just go back to lots of smaller groups instead of a few massive ones. Your space can burn down with all your thousands of astrahus's, I don't give a fuck.
---
its almost like you shouldn't be exempt from having to scout your location before warping to 0 on a gate.
---
There will be fewer targets. Best of luck to the hunters
---
&gt; Sincerely, do you really know what to look at to understand an economic SYSTEM ?
---
I already acknowledged your superior understanding of the economic system and why demand for PLEX (or presumably any market item) is a bad thing for all of us. If demand were to vanish or be severely reduced, we'd all have more time to generate some vitamin D. :)
---
any resource conflict that requires more than 10 people to contest is garbage. it leads to eve we have now .
---
Ah yes, same thing when they tried implementing faction supers and titans to blood raider space
---
Wonder how many people rushed to delve to get themselves a molok
---
The issue is that these resource changes would need to be very regular.
---
Because otherwise it will still stagnate as a super group gets ahold of the.majority of it and grows exponentially more powerful.
---
And then they would be able to easily squash into the new areas as the resources change.
---
It's not a clear and on ious answer.

Happy Cake Day kristallnachte! I hope you will have a wonderful year, that you'll dream dangerously and outrageously, that you'll make something that didn't exist before you made it, that you will be loved and that you will be liked, and that you will have people to love and to like in return.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Was it Mecha dva? Is that the one that podded you?
---
Why about roaming hunters?
---
It works in j space and this is 31x easier with less scanning
---
A lot of Chars that were always sitting in systems in front of ratting/mining pockets will have no purpose anymore, there is no data they can send to NEAR2 Bot anymore ...
---
Considering I've been a ratter and hunted ratters. Neither side of the equation wants a fight, let alone a good or fair one.
---
One doesn't want to be disturbed, the other wants a free kill.
---
It's happening because enough autistic people complained about how easy it is to scout a system only using local.
---
They believe that not having local in null will save the game, coming to this conclusion with how popular wormhole space is and how much people love it there. They also believe that it will stop botting forever, punish super stupid rorq pilots, and make it very easy to get hella dank easy kills. This very act of removing local from null will cause billions of old players to resub and trillions of new players to give it a try.
---
They also don't believe that this will just cause all the people who don't want to be ganked to dock up or move closer together under a larger umbrella. Their philosophy is that if they can't be seen in local, it'll make ganking much easier - even if there's nothing to gank. That's okay to them though because they think they'll just gank other cloaky campers. Which, is super easy without local, apparently.
---
You cant fight while cloaked.
---
There is going to be a lot of salt from both the people crying over this and the ones that are shedding tears of joy
---
I do scout, when I can. Sometimes the gate is 100 AU away from anything and you have to just guess what angle you're going to take. Perfect Intel isn't a thing.
---
Literally resubbed yesterday... and this is something i remember debating at length before I quit 5 years ago. Pleasantly surprised.
---
This guy gets it.
---
Yeah, about that. People that want to fight don't want to sit hours on end in a defense fleet doing nothing else but wait.
---
So I need to park an orca at the belt to sell excavators to local miners?
---
Please make a Jackdaw in glacial drift!!!!
---
wat?
---
&gt;Forgot
---
Biggest kek
---
It will take time to really tell.
---
The first few days won't be indicative of the longer future.
---
Jesus your posting sucks.  We get it, you are a super risk averse carebear that cringes at the thought of pvp.  By all means, stay docked.  Even if all the cowards like you stay docked, there will be tons of roaming gangs out and at the very worst fights will happen between groups of people out hunting.
---
Then people quit.
---
You are not going to find a lot of volunteer fish to jump in your barrel.
---
I’m just pointing out, before any roaming hunters/small gangs looking to poke for a quick bank or fight was at a huge disadvantage
---
Intel chans as we know it will change.   Near2 made redundant (great app btw) .
---
 I cant see gate scouts happening
---
Wonder if this changes gatecamping?
---
In nullsec you would still have your umbrella and Intel networks.
---
In the wormholes you will have none of that.
---
yes , wtf! I was wondering where they went!
---
https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98330748/ 
---
Yup looks like lots of honourable space fights with gangs of equal size or combat capable targets ...
---
&gt; learn to hunt
---
Can i see your kb?
---
Ah yes the obligatory crystal ball viewing garbage commenter with absolutes and no room for discussion.
---
&gt; you would know that harassing their ratters and miners is one of the absolute best ways to get a to get supers dropped on you.
---
Well at that point we might aswell turn off the ESI and really dive into the darkages no? :D
---
Go back to screeching in private please
---
I guess they'll have it a little easier with very small groups now, but everyone who can afford it will just have eyes at 1-2 jumps out so nothing really changed.
---
Is it the one who said cloaks have no risk?
---
I felt more retarded reading your post than before
---
Maybe... try it with moons/isotopes/literally anything.  
---
Maybe not a half assed attempt this time
---
After 2 years away I might have to re sub. Or is fatigue still a thing? Zzzzz
---
Isk will no longer be a necessity accordning to the krabs i've been told.
---
Those eyes have to be watching all the time.
---
That's not really how a standing fleet works.  You go right ahead clearing anoms or doing whatever you normally do, and if someone uncloaks you go fight them.
---
Yeah you probably cant optimally fit for perfect isk/hour but nullsec has always supposed to have been working together to survive in dangerous space, not afk farming your peaceful fields forever.
---
Nobody says you need to sit in your defense fleet and ship spin, it just says be in comms and actually help your corpmates when they need it.
---
That’d be fine?  Right?  Make it a fluid dynamic?  That’d help with structure spam too??  
---
Holy fuck!!  Solving lots of problems here!!
---
Because people earning isk aren't interested in fights. So dropping supers on you in a completely overkill manner is a good way to stop you interrupting you, and persuading you you to go elsewhere for your content.
---
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
back in 2005, I was lost in space, exploring, intimidated by how huge this game was and trying to learn as much about it as possible. This music immersed me into EVE so much. Gave that gloomy feeling of the unknown!
---
Its more economic warfare. And its already messed up ore prices and surely moon goo stuff.
---
Ships so ugly people actually avoid flying them.
---
As a wormhole ceo I’ve had an influx of recruits since the black out announcement. I think it’s gonna make hunters switch to low class holes. They aren’t that hard to live in and the logistics is easy. If I want a hisec connection I find one.
---
No beacause ESI are great for manging a lot of thing.
---
And yes if you have spy in defender alliance you will see they're notification and so timer. 
---
I think the no more intell is a great thing, so you will see some rumour spread all accross 0.0 and WH about fleet and kill and other things... and no people will be able to proof it (unless screenshoot/video).
---
Could be amazing.
---
So don't cry beacause you will not have KM in 0.0 or WH, and go hunt in LS.
---
They do with ice belts you mong, it won’t stir up any conflict. Agreements and backdoor deals will be made all the time
---
I for one cannot believe they are going through with this. I am a peaceful miner who joined a big bloc for their superior protection and intel infrastructure . Now I will be in grave danger from unknown entities at unknown times. This isn’t the game I signed up for and honestly CCP my 4 accounts and over 10 year veteran status to this game is in jeopardy. Quite honestly if I wanted to be a wormholer I’d have moved into wormholes. Let those dullards and cretinous scumlords have their chaotic space. We in null don’t need that chaotic lifestyle. We have empires to build, yes! Empire building is the name of the game. Those short sighted wormhole shitlords wouldn’t know a thing about what we have built in the sanctity or Null.
---
The no more KM make you cry ?
---
Yeah, I agree. Imagine you are a fresh newbro. You lurk for guides and stufff, and they say like "Join null sec for dank battles and big moneys" and you are like fine. Joining nulsec corp takes literally no effort. But then shit goes like dont fly there, dont do that. You want some badass pvp and want to join a fleet? Hell no, here are doctrine ships of completely different faction. So you are stuck to PVE while those are being skilled. And PVE in nullsec guides you into wanting a battleship at least. Want to move back and to highsec activities for a while? Get podded because wardec. Its all kinda messed up.
---
I think the game should offer somekind of FW epic-ark or storyline agent after new player finishes Dagan questline. Because at this point he is capable of flying ships required to participate in FW.
---
Another misleading point against FW ive heard is standing losses. Ive seen newbros asking about FW and response was like "You should create an alpha alt account for that because standing losses". It turns people away even though you do not really need standings for all 4 factions. The only problem here is that gallente and minmatar FW pilots lose access to Jita, which is kinda minor issue, making an alt to haul and sell things to Jita makes more sense than leveling a new character for PVP.
---
As someone who isn't playing Eve for some time now I really like that CCP is trying out stuff that has a huge impact on the game, but I doubt this one will have a positive impact on the game by bringing in more players in the long run.
---
You can't compare null sec to wormhole space because there are no cynos and jumpr drives in wormhole space, So making it easier to drop big fleets on unsuspecting targets will just strengthen the game style of only using caps/supers and only under a huge super capital umbrella.
---
I'm sure there are a lot of players that will like this change and many will get back to the game in the short run. But soon they'll realize that they still only face those super blobs in null sec. So this will only be a short timed revitalization of the game.
---
I would be very happy to be proven wrong though.
---
It's not the end.
---
it's a power buff to all supercapital umbrella and the shutdown of all little entity.
---
&gt;Pleaze 
---
&gt;revalorize LS
---
No I just think you should put more thought into posting than randomly screeching retarded shit
---
 It sure you can make much isk making ships
---
That's what the word was. I didn't like the guy.
---
Oh boy.
---
Yes they have to, but from my experience nobody wants to be the guy that provides eyes to a mining op and be the cause of a Rorq-loss. So those eyes are usually razorsharp.
---
I hope CCP will consider that as bugexploit before the blackout.
---
I ain’t afraid of the dark.
---
So you think its a stupid change right?
---
What do you want me to do, NOT attack the shit fit domi gang?
---
Those eyes are typically in a pod 1000km off the gate and is typically a bot
---
It's not retarder. It's actual way to make game more interesting.
---
So....just one group stomps around the Galaxy growing fat on strength?
---
The voice sounds like a cross between a scotish old man and california girl, it grates on me.
---
*Caww caww!*
---
CCP Falcon descends from on high, a dead field mouse still clasped in his mouth. In one talon is clutched a sheet of notes labeled "Drifter balance adjustments;" curiously, next to each entry is written "69." You aren't certain what that means. In the other talon is a jar of unsubbed krab tears.
---
"Yes, mortal?" he squawks.
---
I see you smelt the power of a total blackout and you like it.
---
Create even more varieties.  
---
But yes let’s just remove local chat and spawn random npcs that do nothing at all to solve the root cause.
---
Ah yes, retarder, I am very retarder
---
You don't really need to make your own standards, CCP already has standards by which it immortalizes things, and can continue to do so.
---
lol that was my attempt with the cormy but the targets started to get farther and farther away (max distance I saw on one of them 50km (he was km away from me)) thanks though
---
Perhaps when you were hunting you weren't looking for a fight, but just because youre trash doesn't mean everybody else is. There are absolutely shit loads of groups that will take out a small gang, hunt ratters, and tackle them hoping a defense fleet will be formed for a reasonable fight. Tackling ratters is one of the very few ways to get nullbears to fight nowadays and even then it doesn't work most of the time.
---
I have played this playstyle pretty much since I started the game 5-6 years ago and can tell you with absolute certainty what you're saying is not the case.
---
Personally I'm too busy with other games to play EVE beyond very light and casual sessions, but it's getting awfully tempting to resub to signal that this is the game I want: dangerous for ***everybody*** again, and not just those beyond the reach of the big dick nullsex alliances.
---
Wow you're dumb
---
well, never seen that myself but I guess it doesn't go sharper than 1's and 0's.
---
Thanks for linking that going to start watching it!
---
hmm my problem with the cormy was that I couldn't get close enough to do decent ( I was doing like 49 per shot) however there were almost a dozen of them and they were all using missles (pve)
---
SO I got demolished (mind you I would flee back to the closest station then come back) however thanks
---
Do you think anyone who does market and industry stuff for their main source of isk would tell you (ie the competition) how they do what they do?
---
I don't mean that in a discouraging way, just to letting you know not to expect much of an answer here.
---
Never go full retard.
---
You know some of the biggest fights in eve weren’t preplanned ops.
---
Losing local and making things more risky places higher stakes on the field for people to succeed or royally fuck up.
---
B-R, Asakai, and other fights were a huge thing because *mistakes were made*
---
Stop projecting your motivations on to others.
---
WTB : ENGLISH TRANSLATION
---
There can very easily still be intel systems for your big corporations, they just have to have people watch gates and communicate with everyone.  Not to mention people won't be able to know you are mining the moment they come into your system.
---
It will take a few days but people are going to be out ratting again in no time. Just need to wait them out for a bit. The biggest issue I see is that there will be more bait until they get bored of that.
---
Looks like all bots already switched to FW.
---
The retarder the betterer
---
Hype AF
---
Retarder*
---
okay thank you (Moa with rails is the reason I mentioned in the post but in the game the problem I had during the Escalation was that there were over a dozen VPCs with missles (kinetic) and so my shields were being destroyed thanks though I can see what you're suggesting
---
Have you not roamed any space with bots in them? Go to Omist, Cobalt Edge, or Detorid. You will see them literally everywhere
---
Too bad they are pussies.
---
I know right, fuck people who have their own opinions and stuff..
---
What's a Near2 bot?
---
Wh tears beacause proposition of no more KM. Best tears
---
How would they grow fat if they literally can’t produce ships uncontested?  You’d have multiple power blocks building up roughly equal amounts of advanced production because they all have to create some kind of market for the restricted goods.  
---
Why wouldn’t this create sigs meant to gank the freighters hailing the materials in from the harvest points?
---
Again I go back to the fact that the player organizations will play the game that is developed.  If the game is slanted too far one way (which it is now with the drifter bullshit and wormhole local in 0.0) people will not undock.  They’ll unsubscribe and go do something else.  
---
The null game isn’t what it was (nostalgia &lt;&gt; good game design unless you’re blizzard and literally shit gold.)
---
The solutions to “the null problems” are more apparent with how bad low sec and high sec are.
---
Starting your own corp and building ships are not things that are going to be very forgiving to a new player. You will not be able to profit off of ship construction unless you move to nullsec or a wormhole. And you won't be able to (successfully) move to nullsec or a wormhole without joining a more experienced group.
---
really with cormy it almost didn't there over a dozen NPCs with kinetic missles and were almost 50 km away so I had trouble going in close to do decent damage (will be considering though)
---
I mean, having a set of pings is pretty nice when traveling through an area as a cloaky too.
---
Retarderer.
---
Please let me know when you unsub, I will let you know which character to send your stuff to.
---
yeah my isk range is (10mil) not that much (i'm a casual)
---
Yup give them a reason to put themselves in that situation.  They didn’t need a local blackout to get to that.  They had reasons to undock.
---
It's more so to fuel mercenary type operations, the ships are the start, intergalactic Switzerland is the end. Atm I also have some people that are gonna help by exploring and mining. I'm probably gonna salvage and mine at the start etc etc.
---
However, akin to what I was asking previous, what do you reccomend then?
---
waaa waaa waaa
---
If they're using kinetic damage use a kinetic dampening shield. Also train your shield skills as far as you can go
---
Zkillbrain are crying....
---
I don't care about issues but I'm just sad FEDUP became full turbo null crab tbh
---
If only the would remodel the npc stations
---
I frankly do not have the time to post sentries to protect my mining domain. I shouldn’t have to post guards in my own house. It is THEY that should be on guard sir. I am of the empire. I have the right of way. They are invaders and should not have the safety of the unknown while I provide my alliance a service.
---
Bingo
---
Bot don't care of blackout... In fact they just have to change code and decision tree and problem solve. YOu ill impact more true player than bot.
---
Well it's what ccp specifically implement in order to fix a bug.
---
Nice of them to start it on the weekend.
---
They'll still be playing the same game, they just won't be logged in to Eve while they do it.
---
&gt; We're the majority too real
---
Yeah so the majority of players are carebear that want perfect safety from people that aren't F1 monkeys and just want consensual structure PvP.
---
I'll be honest I'm fine if you leave the gare.
---
This thread reads more like new years eve preperation and everyone slowly counting down .... :D
---
YES I AM CRYINGER
---
Don't spoil what will happen.
---
And a lot of people willf arm the first week beacause they will not read the memo about no local.
---
you know i experienced the same on one of the instances that I had undocked and had the right click delay I spawned INSIDE the keep star in the middle of it.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/wSnMCq8.gifv](https://i.imgur.com/wSnMCq8.gifv)
---
Until you running out of money...  new players dont survive in FW if not join in a corp.
---
Not a problem Darling.
---
All the salt of blowing up ur ship IG... none of the effort. Thank you
---
Oh boy I cant wait!! The krabs will be all hiding In their forts and keepstars until this event wraps up, unless it's supers / rorqs safe in their supercap umbrellas of course.. Prices of evrything will begin to creep north, and I am stocked to the nines with almost 60 bil In goods.... 
---
Bring on the profits CCP I LOVE YOU for this omg
---
So for a long time it was thought that nullsec was too safe. Local allowed you to know how many people exactly you were going to face at any time as well as knowing how many friendlies were in system. 
---
This change makes the game less about complete knowledge and bluffs and counter plays could be a bigger part of the game. Bigger alliances may contract because they can't keep an eye on all the space and people may be able to sneak around the map now.
---
It was still a good read though.
---
The automatted intel bot that is used in Imperium, TAPI, PanFam and basically in all PvE-Heavy groups. It parses local channel and intel channel log outputs, and processes both data to automatically send a ping sound to the guy with the 10 Rorquals so he knows when to tab in actually from Netflix ...
---
So you either think that all botting folks are programmers themselves or that botting software updates spread as easily as the game updates.
---
I believe neither is true.
---
&gt; LET S DO A TOTAL BLACKOUT IN 0.0 **(and WH could be nice)**. 
---
The part I bolded made my day. Best post ever by Dictateur Imperator.
---
&gt; eve is no longer dying
---
Correction: The acceleration toward death has been reduced. The direction of velocity is still toward death.  Eve is always dying.
---
It's not even perfect safety.
---
The level of risk added with no local in no way reflects the piss poor income you get from subcap ratting.
---
FW sure knows how to bait...
---
But think of all the price increases in raw materials due to krabs being to afraid to pve
---
You need better ranged weapons and hybrid turret skills.
---
The Cormorant properly used can hit up to at least 80km I think.
---
After killing the 10th afk VNI I was already considering not even going after them because it was so boring. I am absolutely looking for targets that can shoot back. It might seem like I'm hunting ratters but that's only because some of them actually fight back or call in help and those are the people I look for.
---
I'll laugh my ass off if hunters reee about the cost of pvp ships.
---
&gt; The level of risk added with no local in no way reflects the piss poor income you get from subcap ratting.
---
Good I hear every other type of space need more players.
---
Read i ask no more KM to, it's why i include WH.
---
More work for our incursion squad with less movement. Win win (as long as there is loot/isk)
---
;)
---
Just if there is no Christmas sale
---
Afk players aren't going to do either... they're afk.
---
Sounds awful. On their side too. I can't imagine staying standby for long and then get a cue to join to kill a friggin cruiser.
---
The first weekend it's going to be like in "The Purge"
---
When will people realize that no local also means attackers have no idea about your numbers?
---
So you're not undocking, hmmmm? I guess you don't need your space then anymore *wink wink toast toast wink wink* :P
---
Lets see how long it takes until someone by accident presses the undocking button by looking at a burning iHub :P
---
I used to love roaming in FW, then they changed how sliding works and there's a cloaki on every plex
---
Quit this "make eve great again" shit, it makes you look retarderedrederedered even more.
---
So what exactly are you doing now that benefits the game and is not possible without local?
---
Plex price is already falling! Buy buy buy! Btfd!
---
You need to mine like mad.
---
Nothing of value was lost.
---
So you agree it don't solve problem for long time, juste for a week.
---
pls yes
---
Botting just got way more expensive.
---
Moving stuff got way more expensive.
---
Free intel is no more.
---
I might just resubscribe.
---
You aren't wrong
---
I still dunno how this will really pan out, maybe I have high hopes for nothing, but all the people resubbing and all this salt flowing already makes Blackout worth it and it's not even yet started.
---
Access to hisec trade hubs is easier from WH space than from most of null. Perhaps some will try ratting/mining in WH space as the dangers are now pretty equivalent? Null has the threat of blops while j-space does not, even tho some null seccers have intel channels and cap umbrella as a counter, which j-space does not have. Will be interesting to see whether there are behavior changes.

lol volta, cant actually fight other pvp groups so has to resort to farming crabs lolol

Moved out of nullsec because of boredom, moving back to nullsec because fuck yeah.

He's a goon, duh.
---
I agree sir, I’m a lover , a poet, a philosopher, not a fighter. I don’t engage in barbaric nonsense that these “ elite” simpletons hold so dear. When I have my 4, count them 4 Rorqual mining apparatus accounts mining rich bountiful ores I do not watch intently. Instead I treat myself with a few chapters of Moby Dick and a glass of Cognac.
---
No probes, no outposts, no anomalies, no pos, no capitals, no destroyers, no battlecruisers, no PI, no sov, no alliances (official alliances weren't in the game). Hell there was even no conquerables once :P
---
I hope CCP addresses them if they become problematic. Easiest solution I can think of is have the cloak cost LO meaning the person has to leave to refuel or Cyno in a refuel “truck” before LO runs out.
---
Bye
---
so, they openly admit "they can't fix chat problems"
---
People attack grammar and orthographe when they don't have other argument.
---
And english is far from be my native language, if i post in my language you will just not understand. You have understand idea you react on orthograph. Means you have no counter argument. 
---
So you are crying by trying to attract attention on people on something with no importance to hide you're lack of argument.
---
Their killboard says otherwise
---
&gt; Simply by not providing target character ID 
---
Sorry. What? How can one be a bounty hunter without knowing who the target is?
---
&gt; Have fun running into a gate camp 
---
Again, what has this got to do with the proposed bounty system?  If the player with the bounty is killed by a gate-camp the bounty won't pay out (except in the very, very unlikely scenario that someone on that gate happens to also have the same 'bounty contract').
---
&gt; Or finding a specific ship at Jita 4-4.
---
See my point above. The whole system only works if the hunter knows who to kill. That's kind of the entire point of a bounty.
---
Dwardeen is a wormholer, the prospect of no local shocked him.
---
It's awesome my beautiful powerblocks will grow stronger mmmmmmmm ball up little ones... ball up!!!
---
Shares in Kleenex soar as nerds a climate to their final bastion of self import is jeopardised in shocking move to remove all consent from pvp.... In a game about non consensual pvp.

Been to both, both are fun in their own way. But if I had to choose, Iceland all the way. The country is great with very unique landscape, people are warm and welcoming, and you'll meet way more of EVE community. 
---
It's cold weather though, be prepared for that. On the bright side, there's a good chance of seeing Northern lights.
---
Can you retarders stop being retarder.. you're both retarderer
---
Oh man i dont even know what that is hehe.. this game have so much to understand hehe
---
oh boy, we've got a [thinker](http://starecat.com/content/wp-content/uploads/i-am-a-freethinker-i-am-an-individual-therefore-i-do-not-believe-in-silly-archaic-doctrines-or-follow-established-religion-like-the-mindless-sheep-you-all-are-i-am-intellectually-superior.jpg) here
---
Already replaced
---
I literally cannot see a downside to this. 
---
But of course, with a flair like that, *you* might.
---
He's not wrong. People need to feel that if they are vigilant and do their part correctly (watch local and intel channels) that they have a reasonable amount of safety and can protect themselves based on their own actions. 
---
People who don't do their part, don't watch local and intel, are afk, those people deserve to be caught and killed.
---
However, removing local feels like moving to a more "random luck" based system of safety where you have very little actions you can take to protect yourself since you no longer have good tools for intel other than dscan which doesn't provide enough advanced warning, especially for the capital meta where capitals are locked in place during module cycle times. 
---
I know I'm not going to undock either, I'm just going to go play another game. I'm not risking my money on a game of luck, I'm not into gambling.
---
shit i have not gotten ready for this at all. well when it comes ill take one for the team and be a great example of safty breeding complancy

I think it's the no KM proposition who shocked him.

Thanks. I hate it.

Yes I can't wait. I've been drooling over this since this was announced and put every penny of isk in the market

---
don't even ask about REDs
---
Thank you for the info! What is crab life?
---
P awww W m n bggbuc
---
So said no local is good against bot is just a bullshit argument and everyonen who use it  to justify end of local are just stupid . 
---
We have an agreement.
---
CCP Also said the same about the Silver Magnate - That they would never re-release. 
---
I invested, got one, and held onto it despite offers in the hundreds of billions. 
---
On a whim they decide to re-release and render next to worthless.   Not even something that says it was one of the original ones. Frustrating.
---
Before you could made deeps safes several hundred Au away from the star then they quickly hotfixed to 172 au and then at a latter patch changed it to a random point 40-60 au away from star.
---
&gt; if i post in my language you will just not understand.
---
On pari combien? :p
---
Seriously. This has been something people have talked about for a long ass time. This isn't some original thought by CCP. Removing local from null has been debated to death like every year since null existed. Same deal with anti-cap bombers or DD battleships. The people who pushed these ideas a few years ago are suddenly against them because they stand more to lose now.
---
Listen up you vanilla frosted 🅱️itch I whelped a whole corp worth of folks last night and not a single one so much as fired back. I'd kill a man for some tense hunter Vs hunter shit.
---
Awesome! Thank you for the links! I’ll check them out!
---
Bots retiring and confidence in the market falling.
---
What happened to HTFU lmao eve is so soft now
---
But what about the half that is below the average?
---
If you don't want to be disturbed, stick to hisec.
---
You have literally nobody else to blame.
---
If you prepare adequately it's not a luck based game.  Null was never meant to be somewhere to safely make money with perfect safety
---
So many dead supers it's going to be glorious
---
they gona do it on  August 27th!
---
I literally seed suicide raitarus hoping to see a fleet arrive to blow them up. 
---
Then I wind up taking them down three weeks later when nobody notices they're even there.
---
Ha Ha  why do I think i care about my kb/km? :)
---
Don't spend a dime. Minerals you mine yourself are free.
---
Give members shares of your corp as an isk incentive.
---
That's part of the fun, finding your niche(s) and working out what you can and can't build to make profit. Look on zkill to see what's dying a lot, rigs, ships, modules then check the market to see what's selling well. From there workout your margins and see if it's worth your time. I wouldn't even mine, buy and import all your materials
---
I'm new blood and im trying man I'm trying lol gonna be a bit before I can figure out the whole running a corporation thing.

---
You're either miner #5236921 in an empire that's been around for years or you aren't building shit in nulsec in 2019.
---
"You're in null you should feed me free kills" lol no.
---
They won't because the fear is too strong in the krab.
---
There is a cloaky prot watching you. Even when there's not.
---
Lol hit me up via mails if you end up needing advice for newbro CEO things, been there done that, keep at it bro
---
Other case you will think it s a nice improvement of the game.
---
Cool! Thank you for the info and the leads. I mainly wanted to know the political info because the game seems to be very different in lowsec and nullsec than in highsec. I assume I have a lot of history to catch up on and stuff to learn about all the alliances, where they are and how they interact.
---
Do... Do you *not* understand what the "null" part of "null-security" actually means?
---
Let me spell it out for you. 
---
null
---
/nəl/
---
adjective
---
1.
---
having no legal or binding force; invalid.
---
"the establishment of a new interim government was declared null and void"
---
synonyms:invalid, null and void, void; More
---
2.
---
having or associated with the value zero.
---
This is great. So true I laughed out loud when it clicked
---
wow, you really showed them! has it occured to you that pvpers can fight each other?
---
While we are at, remove names from gates
---
Did you even read my full comment? 
---
&gt; some of them actually fight back or call in help
---
Not all of them are afk, which is the only reason I engage them. Also I don't complain that some people feed free kills, it's just not that rewarding to me if nothing threatens me. 
---
Just yesterday a super landed as i was killing an afk vni, that made the kill worth it because there was a heavy time limit on if I can kill the vni. It made me orbit very close so I can apply more dps and I almost died to the vni because of it.
---
Cut all Gates in and out off null. Only way in or out is by wh xp
---
Last time local worked somewhat but it owt people in the chat and stuff like that. This is wormhole style local imposed on nullsec.
---
bye
---
And just for those with short term memory how well was that received?  
---
What did ccp do to try to buy back some goodwill?
---
No-local makes people more vulnerable, this is good and that's it. I left a note about bots just because I can see faction warfare area is infested with deplexing ventures lately, who knows why...
---
Yawn
---
Can I have your space?
---
Thank you for the link! This sounds like it will be very helpful and a lot of the info I need.
---
Incursions got the nerf bat so dont expect it to be as great as it once was
---
Where’s everyone at?  Why u no undock?
---
And it is glorious.
---
Technically there is six other points that you mentioned in your post beside the "No km part" :)
---
So it could be any other reason, (assuming that i'm crying)
---
That’s Imperium right?
---
Thanks dude!
---
Man you guys are in for a disappointing couple a weeks
---
Not asking for perfect safety, just a reasonable amount. Going completely blind is not a reasonable amount. Not everyone has a massive capital umbrella with a bazillion bot alts they can sit on gates to watch every single thing that happens.
---
I guess technically you could call it a bot but it doesn't read who is in channels as far as I'm aware (would require something more than just reading a txt file and would be against EULA) and doesn't automate warping off etc. I still think that programs like Near2 will be useful without local though, although nowhere near as robust as it currently is.
---
My wife may see a rise or 3.
---
I sincerely hope everyone that feels like this doesn't resub.  It's people like you that make this game feel stagnant. If you really don't want to deal with local, go move to high sec you casual.
---
Btw how is plex trading? I have always been more successful in the mid term with minerals / goo, ships and certain modules 
---
I know this absurd amount of combat recons is gonna pay dividends come this weekend when I put them up hahahaha
---
Well no Krabs only the rattters /  miners ready to be dropped.
---
There's no such thing as bait. 
---
Only unfortunately prompt reinforcements.
---
The fury road is open! Mad Max nullsec let's go!
---
Nice video and fight.  Damn, I love Seddow's Mom - and Seddow ain't bad either.
---
show me a br please of 2 competent fighting each other please.
---
#MAY THE  ODDS FOREVER BE IN YOUR FAVOR.
---
Manufacturing can make isk, it's what i do mainly. It does take a bunch of logistics though, especially if you go for ships (universally requires a freighter, both for silly amounts of tritanium in and built ships out), preferably multiple. You also need a decent amount of starting capital and you'll need to keep up on the market a lot. If your things don't sell, you don't get your isk back for more manufacturing.
---
As for what to build, there are useful free tools out there. I don't know if [IPH] (https://eveiph.github.io/) is still updated nowadays but i used it years ago (now have my own custom tools :P). There's also [fuzzworks] (https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/), a very helpful site with a materials/profit calculator and a lot of other resources related to industry.
---
I can’t wait for the salt posting of the idiots finding nothing to shoot at.  
---
It will be....
---
Glorious
---
That’s the whole every Wednesday attacks ramp up thing right?
---
Tenu !
---
Maybe EVE is just not your game.
---
That's why there are no gate guns or concord
---
I love the smelt of napalm in the morning
---
can't tell if bait, most likely bait.
---
Either way, to any krab that does this, we'll just shoot your infrastructure instead. Start clearing out the space trash for new entities to move in.
---
Good Luck
---
It is but it's much less off a bitch
---
Having the same IQ as the average member doesn't automatically give you the average IQ, you know...
---
yeah, removing such features removes soul from game
---
Doubtful, the average nullbloc player likes having everything laid out for him. Fleets, content generation, supply, security.  Even in the larger wormhole entities they would have to have some responsibility in providing one or more of those things for themselves. In other words, spodbrain 2 lazy.
---
Facebook is full of people saying they are going to play other games. This is the single best change that has happened to eve in a very long time. Keep it up CCP!
---
Makes me want to resub after 5 years also.
---
Does your corp / alliance not have intel channels and scouts?
---
There isn’t perfect safety.  That’s about as misleading as test being blue to goons
---
Null is wealthy because the players made it so.  That’s not a ccp problem.  That’s a you problem.
---
How would that work, since 1 Titan is bigger than 30km? Surely it would be easier to just use a domi with grapple and scram, and then just cyno supers on top of it
---
Well this imposed local blackout is going to first off muddle up the data. Next it's going to cause real players to not login. Third microtransactions are going to drop because of fewer players. Less transactions mean less money and the more likely the last few developers are going to be axed.
---
Which means people can freely engage you...
---
Come on, you're getting there, don't give up yet.
---
Well it helps to sort out who’s saying what.  This is different people here.
---
There's not much else going on in null other than pinged fleets. 
---
I play the game as it is, not s lot of other options.
---
So when roamers come do you dock up your PVE ship get in a PVP ship and start chasing them around with the rest of standing or do you just dock up and wait for them to leave? Do you ever spend any time in standing fleet at the ready to engage people coming in or do you exclusively spend all your time in your PVE ship?
---
Guess you better watch that dscan and be aligned then huh?
---
I am with you here. Cant wait for all the roaming pvpers to cry how it's impossible to find targets. Just wait until they have to carry combat probes on every ship. It's going to be glorious.
---
They stop ratting already when I come. I don't see a loss for me, this change is only gains 💪💪💪.
---
&gt; I mostly just watch Netflix or play PoE while playing this stupid game so no real change from my end. 
---
And nothing of value was lost
---
I agree and that's why these changes are good ones.  The current intel system is too powerful and players are too risk adverse.  Null should be both profitable and dangerous, its currently only one of those things
---
I'm struggling to see a gang fight there at all... Honestly it's just ratters. It's like ganking a barge or freighter in highsec and then crying that they don't fight back. I'm guessing most of these 'hunters looking for content' rabbit as soon as the defenders undock anything actually capable of fighting back.
---
we've already gone over this, i dont wanna have another round of discussion
---
And shepherds we shall be, for Thee, Mad Bob, for Thee
---
Power hath descended from Thy hand, that our fleets may swiftly carry out Thy command
---
And we shall roll a chain forth to Thee, and teeming with wrecks shall it ever be
---
E Nomine Artemis, Et Apollo, Spiritus Cloaky
---
And that doesn't mean I have to feed you free kills.
---
A T1 cruiser at that, like...the fuel cost is literally more than the value of the hull.
---
This is what Eve is now.
---
But if it's a refuge of Liars, as in where the liars live, wouldn't that also make it a Liar Lair? I don't suppose we could ever ask them, they probably couldn't be trusted to give an honest answer....
---
NEAR2 killed a whole playing style that was necessary to the ecosystem as a sink for ISK and resources. It caused a huge amount of REAL players to quit the game (logged in accounts today saturday 2000 EU prime barely reach the logged in accounts of Wednesday 1400 in 2013) or if you compare the same timestamp, the have nearly halved. So basically the Multiboxing-PvE-Meta that was promoted with NEAR 2 was NOT able to close the gap in logged in accounts. In my opinion NEAR2 has a good part done to EVE being a more static, grinding oriented game ...
---
My point here to guy comment. Why would you carry and expensive items in your cargo for no reason.
---
I know CCP was trying to be reasonable in how they introduced this feature, but they've given the botters like a week to plan for it. I wish they'd just dropped it one day for that reason.
---
players like isk, which WH provides in abundance, but WH still takes a lot of effort, specifically INDIVIDUAL effort, on a constant basis, which most people hate
---
I expect the blackout to push people who were already destined to WHs even harder and faster toward Bob, but the rest will just wash out, stay docked, or go to JS/HS
---
can't wait to go bot hunting this weekend!
---
Not gonna lie, this is the first time I've been tempted for a while now. Still... 
---
... I just don't trust CCP not to fuck it up. I'm going to wait and see.
---
Nobody ever said it did, buddy. But it does mean that every ship in nullsec is already destroyed. It just doesn't know it yet. 
---
If you can't handle that sooner or later you *will* die, that's on you.
---
There is reasonable safety... in highsec.  Null is supposed to be risky.
---
Rat with friends!  Cloaky camping and hot dropping only works because most people fit their ships for maximum isk making and then rat alone, also for maximum isk making.  If you rat in a fleet with ships fight for a real fight you'll make less isk per hour but you'll also be much safer.
---
But no, nobody wants a collaborative and dynamic game because that's less money
---
Is there going to be a nul sec reset with all alliance assets destroyed (or severely reduced)  by various NPC means since players will not pvp in serious numbers?
---
I feel sorry for anyone who brings a BC or BS into a plex. They'll just get swarmed by T1 frigs and won't be able to hit jack.
---
We already have salt posting of people finding nothing to shoot at
---
Which is why CCP made this change in the first place
---
Fatigue is a thing, but apparently it isn’t nearly as punishing as it used to be.
---
Beat me to it!
---
I think I'm on my 6th year unsubbed, going in with some other old mates of mine. It's going to be a hard relearning experience for all of us!
---
Over the top
---
Nah, just going to go play something else. I'm super causual anyway, only play a few hours a week at most. Really not worth risking anything expensive. I imagine many other people will do the same, or only undock in cheap stuff like VNIs.
---
That ending was one of the best closures to a sitcom going, pity it didn't start a few seconds earlier, with poor old Cpt Darling's line
---
Let me clarify then. A lot of the same people who complain about the game having grown stale and bitch about things needed to be changed are the same ones nay-saying the local black out experiment. If it effects them in any way negatively fuck CCP. If it helps them they gobble CCP dick. We need more chaos. We need more disruptions. And I am totally happy with CCP testing changes live and tying it in lore wise.
---
please locally grown trebuches are always better. support the local siege industry
---
I think you might be putting *just* a little too much faith in the krabs.
---
How many tickets do you think CCP is going to get that local isn't working? Be honest.
---
&gt;those super blobs in null sec.
---
Right now, those super-blobs see a blops/goku/kiki gang coming from a couple jumps away.  They get a count of hostiles, they can get a scout to get eyes on them and follow. They can see exactly when they leave and enter a system. They can formulate a response (HAW Dreads? Harpies? Carriers?) and have a couple minutes before they need to act to get alts logged-in, undocked, and ready to jump.    
---
In the blackout era, they're going to know about it when it actually shows-up on-grid with the Rorq-fleet.  Or when that super-ratter gets bubbled.  A cloaked saber could be sitting on a ping watching a target until it gets vulnerable and there's no way to know it's there. 
---
Those extra couple minutes can easily mean the difference between getting a capital-kill and having to disengage.
---
Do it. 
---
*Do it now.*
---
Ratting in hisec is going to take off
---
Yes. 
---
YES. 
---
Join us.
---
Lot of respect to Inner Hell, they are such a pain to play against.
---
10m a tick will never sound appetizing.
---
highsec is that way -&gt;
---
FOR THE STATE!
---
Talk is cheap. Half the coalition runs on a server farm, let em moan.
---
&gt;I just won't fucking undock.
---
k
---
Quite sad. Although there are so many cool features like hacking, PI and production the entirety of the game has no dedicated core gameplay.
---
It's not nearly as bad as it used to be. By the time your cap has done what it needs to do your fatigue timer is gone and you can go on back free of hassle.
---
Thank you for the reply! I have actually been watching your videos on game mechanics and love them! They answer a lot of the questions I had but also raise a few more. 
---
Also thank you for the info and leads about the current political situation and leads to groups in nullsec. It’s always good to see a community help a newbie-ish person out!
---
Just wait until they find a mining/ratting fleet only to not be able to see that cloaked cyno ship sitting on field with them ready to light.
---
Can I have "What are T3Ds and T3s for 500 please Alex"? 
---
You only really need them on one ship BTW. Everyone else can just fit more guns and missiles
---
This should be fun.
---
Any word on the why behind this? Is the N space chat being moved onto an older, discrete W space chat server so they can address issues with their updated system or is it a test of game mechanics?
---
Check out systems near Amamake, it's usually pretty busy all hours.
---
This is also the first step towards CCP changing that as well.
---
Anybody else getting a weird boner about this? Like I want it as long as somebody else is the bottom.
---
yup and it will die almost as quickly, eve is a fairly rock paper scissors game, just throw a small dread bomb at said super and laffo at the easy killmail.
---
Yes. Yes it is. 
---
They only cloak not spook the krabs. When it's one person wanting a fight Vs another, it's a fuckin blast.
---
I've lost plenty of ratting ships.
---
That still doesn't mean that I have to feed you free kills.
---
I suppose it depends on the exact mechanics behind the mobile inhib, which I'm not 100% sure about tbf. The game calculates positions and ranges different for different things, that I do know.
---
For instance, even tho a titan is massive and it's guns slow (even HAWs), it can be tricky to get *under it's guns* because the tracking velocity used for their calculations is based on the center of the ship, which is like 15km in diameter. So even if you are orbiting at 500m, as far as the tracking formulas are concerned you are in fact orbiting at 15.5km.
---
Other mechanics use the edge of the ship bubble as the metric for calculations. But assuming the mobile inhib hides anything that has it's *center* within 30km of it, you could conceivably arrange a circle of titans around it in such a way they are hidden.
---
Which is way cooler, tbh. People will have a few seconds to regret their last warp command before they exit warp and land in the middle of the boson fire :P
---
Then fight back or die like the rest, bruv.
---
I like the sound of beginner friendly! Isn’t Goonswarm the group that started on Something Awful?
---
+1
---
Do it do it do it do it
---
Right in the feels
---
What about if it Declocks anything that warps on grid with it . Except if its placed on a gate grid? (Insert some cannon about gate cloak boosting strength of cloak or destabilising mobile scan inhibitors decloak ability , and/or add a tech II version with the decloak ability etc .  That way you dont wreck cloaky travel gate to gate and you can “hide” as well on gate as you can in other places forcing you to go deeper into the system . 
---
So you know you have been made even if the cloaky warps at range.  Get a free kill if he’s stupid enough to warp close and you have what it takes to deal with him .
---
Bots definitely care about this. Cloaky ships and hotdroppers are going to be all over the place when this launches, and there will be nothing anyone, player or bot, can do about it
---
Or, just dock up and do neither since I gain nothing from feeding you free kills
---
We have altered the deal, pray we do not alter it any further
---
I think we should call this event “ the culling of null” if one in ten gives up their krabing ways it is a major win for everyone. All it takes is one good kill and you fixem.
---
Oh! Thanks! I am up to speed now, I think. What is a blue doughnut? It sounds NSFW.
---
We will adapt.
---
"feeding free kills" is just your way of defining undocking in dangerous space isn't it?
---
nope.
---
I'm doubting the blackout will live up to the hype.  There may be more kills initially but the big blocks will adapt quickly and the hunters will be dispatched.   The smaller alliances however won't be able to adapt as quickly and will suffer more losses.  I am hoping botters eat a bag of dicks on this though.  One thing the blackout announcement has done though is distracted everyone from the big nullsec issues and problems and CCP didn't have to lift a finger to try and fix them.
---
Well played CCP.  Well played.
---
I'd say so too, if half of them didn't run on a raspberry pi.
---
nice happy for you to reach your milestone
---
You can still have bookmarks further out by bookmarking spots in between incursion sites, but there it depends on the system size.
---
Is that what OP describes also possible in small systems with maybe 10 AU max plane diameter ?
---
Quality shitpost. Would read again.
---
Ratting ships aren't going to kill a competent hunter.
---
Thanks for volunteering.
---
Your shift to watch the gate for 8 hours starts at 12:30.  You can not do anything else but watch the gate so that you don't miss anyone, so keep your alts logged off.
---
Please do. Nullsec is going to be fun and dangerous.
---
The Atron just looks like a Navitas with wings.
---
Have you considered hunting them back?
---
Because that's what we really want. 
---
Roaming is making a comeback and it's going to be a hoot.
---
IIRC, you cannot land further than the further planet
---
Dont worry, ive got a bait rorqual. Ill find the hunters.
---
My keyboard is more advanced than my ships scanner.
---
People will turtle up under umrellas, caps will be the only viable thing to rat in  
---
Other Krabs will stay docked  
---
People roaming for easy krab frags will be even more frustrated than they are today
---
Nice wishful thinking you got there.
---
What's going to happen is those supers and rors you so badly want to kill will only undock when the standing fleet is active, which for big blocs is 23/7.
---
And then the only thing you're going to get instead of a proportional response is a FAX repping the target and a DD to the face.
---
The America one from the sota?
---
Adapt or Die
---
Bye, you won't be missed
---
Please do
---
FOR TGE TATE!
---
doi it boy
---
I want my old rupture model back... and the jukebox. :)
---
At least hunters will have the field leveled in their favor, I hope after a few juicy super kills more get into it.
---
can you explain this for someone who only reads about eve?
---
See ya, I'm enjoying the cheap Plex/injectors
---
You know how you get desktop notifications the second someone who isn't blue so much as *looks* at delve? 
---
It's that.
---
Noppe, it is because CCP and Lifeblood-Patch made it so. Back then you were screeching "adapt or die" now it is your turn to suck the same shit down, grow up a man and live with it as we did when CCP patched away our SRP-Income in one day from 100 to zero ...
---
Schneckt was the best &lt;3 !!!!
---
&gt; NC. Discord, #general-chat 
---
Fake news, everyone knows NC. alliance chat was deleted in a fit of rage by Vince late last year.
---
People who rorqual mine have a few alts, generally. Park one of them 200km off in a covert ops frigate, and now all your change does is slightly raise the entry barrier, and drastically nerf pvp ships with cynos
---
can someone explain this for the spectators?
---
Its not about who wants a fight or not, its about whether they know they are about to get dunked on. 
---
Sure, nobody wants thier blops gang to  get counterdropped, but they wont know its coming.
---
I don't gain anything from that, it's a waste of my time.
---
Fuck dude I'd be happy with a few atron kills, at least that means the days of subcap roams are back.
---
It's called fun. 
---
You should try it.
---
Alliance level logistics rely too heavily on cynos, CCP would have to simplify all the infrastructure that large alliances need to have before blacking out cynos
---
When you are too scared to play in null just move to high sec not bitch about it in reddit.

You just need to make a couple jumps into null to see that there are citadels on pretty much all important gates, which names make it evident they're just a 1000km gate perch that comes with tether. It's not a game of luck, you just need to put in the effort now to have a reliable intel network and not just someone sitting anywhere in the system watching a chat window and tipping off anyone without even needing to undock.
---
Ore prices have already gone up 50% from a month ago from the rorq nerfs. This will be even more gravy
---
I know what I said. 
---
Black. 
---
Out.
---
Cynos.
---
If your PvP ship with a cyno fitted has problems, you might want to light it
---
&gt; It's called fun.
---
For you.
---
I know lore wise it doesn't make sense what with our vast technology, but real world scenario it would absolutely destroy the server.
---
You are correct sir, I am one of many miners. We are legion. We are EvE. We are the sandbox. For we mine the rock and utilize its minerals to provide the very vessels you use to persecute the so called weak.
---
If you can't find fun in roaming PvP gangs I honestly feel a little bad for you. 
---
Just a little though.
---
Or mabe the 15% sale they just did?
---
&gt; Cloaky ships and hotdroppers are going to be all over the place when this launches, and there will be nothing anyone, player or bot, can do about it
---
sounds like balanced gameplay to me /s
---
Null will go from 95% empty to 98% empty.  roamers will be bored shitless.  Bots will still work.  25k will be the new high point for concurrent.
---
The reality is like i said, this experiment really only benifits whalers and large null sec enties. 
---
I will just continue to use my imperium account to rat in a combat fit nyx, and hunt with my wormhole toon for people that dont have the ability to have a entire supershield come to there defence at a pop of a cyno. 
---
Both events have just proven that CCP is either encourging people to live under massive alliances or that disconnected to see that only the massive alliances provide effective counters to what they have thrown out so far. Making them more attactivd to the random player base.
---
you wouldn't believe how stupid krabs are
---
Oddly, I've had it intermittently for the last few days but ONLY on the alt I run on my second monitor.
---
Unusual, since low-latency Eve is generally the one good thing about living in the UK.
---
Too bad the change won’t solve the problem eh sport
---
2018 intrigued by the only cut throat pvp game on the market, ccp looks very involved and passionate about the game from all the fanfest vids. 2019 sick of roaming literally hundreds of jumps with only bots and carebears docking up when I show in local, citadels everywhere, specially shitty in fw. Now the trigs in hisec I do like even if it seems like a lot of dev time and only adresses a small minority of playestyles. The small nerfs to rorqs and supers are okay but not enough, the local removal is just great. I wish i played when the game was a hardcore mmo but still hopeful ccp realizes their market is a niche within a niche. There are better titles with themepark pve.
---
&gt; Perfect for sneakily bringing in 200+ Bombers,
---
why would you need to seed bombers?
---
then it's no different than any other ship being 100km away and you want autoaggro to counter kiters not ECM. Also my personal hop it they limit autoaggro to players but remove it from rats.
---
So all you crying people and reddit whiteknights is to punish people that make themselves an managed organization and handed free kill for anyone undocking anything expensive, am i Right? 
---
I tell you what, why don’t we ask ccp to show every capital / super / titan on the map, and while we on it get fitted dreads for free on any npc station with extended jump range, free for anyone except imperium and legacy memebers.
---
perfect timing. great execution. quality bait.
---
There's a big difference between Stunt ^(RIP) tacking your VNI in an astero and a Tuskers small gang tacking your VNI
---
Maybe maybe?
---
:D
---
How do you scan nothing?  Do the scanners then spawn target?   Seems like you’re talking about a PvE game?
---
Comment below if the first thing you will say when you log into your nullsec staging is some variation of either "Marco - Polo" or the "Z 0 R" chain.
---
I recommend learn how the game works first.
---
Fair point! From a game design perspective it does seem a little weird to punish players simply for not pressing the same button over and over. Is that really one of the skills Eve should be about?
---
I look forward to slurping your pod goo, krab.
---
I have fu, doing fun things.
---
They also require isk.
---
Deployment to Oasa, anyone?
---
Sibire Whittney for CSM 15
---
I don't give a flying fuck about your power blocs and just want to watch the world burn.
---
Don't kid yourself, the call of the krab is too strong for krabs like you
---
I have break you're hope of killing bot with no local ? Sorry for you.
---
How Bout we remove the overview during blackout . . .
---
Someone poked out one eye of yours? Because you just ride on the "demand"? Where in your "calculation" (rofl) is the supply? You seem like one eye blind to me ...
---
Might I suggest buying fifty frigates and shipping them out to a staging system? 
---
Month's worth of goodshit for a can of relic loot.
---
If you can't find fun in X I honestly feel a little bad for you.
---
How dare you not like what I like, i'm offended, you should quit.
---
Too bad they're all gonna be docked.
---
Let's be honest, you'd have to be dumber than a box of rocks to undock a super for at least the first little bit of this.
---
Let me introduce you Super umbrella
---
And you aren't counter dropping shit in a cruiser. It won't live long enough.
---
So nullsec is dead in autz like it always is
---
Overview is fine, beacause you need it to play.
---
What?? No I'm talking about a fleet engagement the auto agress is to continue the DPS I was applying to the target I had locked not to aggro the kitting ecm boat.... If it was just him on grid I would just warp off 🙄
---
It's like that because of server strain. They don't have to process the dscan of every single pilot all the time. But they would if it was automatic.
---
Based on your multiple posts in this thread alone I see you're one of the "hurrdurr this gonna kill the game stupid CCP" crowd so this may go over your head. Waiting out a bug that resulted in messed up local is very different than players choosing to not to play based on a mechanic CCP is implementing. One is not playing something broken, the other is not playing because God forbid you face any risk.
---
I eagerly await your "BuT iTs tHe SaMe iNtEnT dOeSnT mAtTeR!!" reply.
---
I get that a lot unfortunately :( not what you said exactly but usually something similar.
---
I honestly want to sub a hundred alts just to shoe CCP how glad I am they're shaking up the swamp.
---
Historically bots have used local chat pilot listings to immediately warp their ships out of the combat sites they farm money in literally the instant that someone hostile to them comes into the system, making them virtually impossible to catch even in the fastest of ships.
---
Now there are no local listings, which means any potential botters will have to find some other method to get Intel on when they are being threatened. There are already a few ideas floating around of course, but any means they develop will be slower and/or less reliable than what they have now mean a lot more of them will be caught and killed.
---
I give it 2 weeks before the bittervets remember it was easier to be a bittervet and un-sub again for \~reasons\~.  
---
But besides that, yey no local.
---
Maybe try to play the game for something other than just krabbing to plex your account?
---
How many big coalitions lost a citadel to drifters?
---
Sep covers pretty much any ship I want to fly almost 100%.
---
I'm not though.
---
You’re still pissed that they made noon goo active mining?  Wow dude. Get a life
---
currently you csn look at a chat channel to determine who is in your solar system. bots use this to keep themselves perfectly safe. this chat channel will no longer display the list of people in your system, it only displays who talks in that channel.
---
bots no longer have any way to determine if they are safe. neither do krabs (risk averse scum sucking pve whales who only want safety) so they are reeeing
---
No, I think the energy behind these changes is stupid - because I know that once everyone adapts, the bitching will reverse and everyone will be saying all this same shit, but only if they bring local back.
---
titans aren't more than 30km
---
Fantastic! I suggest with this coming blackout, you make use of it.
---
Thanks! Ill use and abuse this!
---
Oh shit! I think you all are going to have blast checking out the new weapons and ships that have been released in the last six years. Just a side note, if you all planning to do Blops, they made T3 cruisers into decent covert logi.
---
Once you've typed you don't disappear until you leave the system or they leave the system right. So only people who are with you in system when you type see you in the list until you jump out or they change system... Or is it that typing reveals you for a set amount of time to anyone coming into that system even if they come in after you've typed?
---
**Additional PSA:** This wouldn't be an issue if there was some danger to the ship that's cloaked outside of network issues. Downvote to keep your safe space safe
---
No you don't
---
You still pissed they remove local, wew dude get one too ....
---
“As someone who doesn’t play, here’s a dumb unsolicited opinion”
---
What?? No I'm talking about a fleet engagement the auto agress is to continue the DPS on the target I was applying to before I got jammed not to aggro the kitting ecm boat.... If it was just him on grid I would just warp off 😉. Ok good I'm glad you agree but I must wonder why we started this conversation then?? 😂
---
interesting, thanks!
---
This image sums up my opinion of this post:

---
click on some item is just absolutely boring without overview. And it do'nt igve you free intel.
---
But their looks *are* their sin.
---
yes it does give free intel idiot
---
put some real work in and measure speed with ur eyes retard
---
Maybe both are bots
---
It will be, but it will also be downvoted.
---
So there's an expiration even if neither of you leaves system. What happens if the sender or recepient change system during the 15 minutes and then come back into the same system?
---
You are so salty.
---
you don't like to looze free intel ?
---
These changes do nothing but piss off the people you wish to hunt.  To the point they’re unsubbing.  
---
There will roaming gangs all out for the same null block scalps and news flash.. the null block scalps will not be undocking the layup mining/ratting ships.
---
being a.bot sounds boring as fuck
---
I'm from Taisy II and I say kill 'em all!
---
Chat is stored in a different system than billing so GDPR doesn't apply to game logs.
---
Not really - I’ve unsubbed the mining alts.  Will only have the PvP account going “now and then”.
---

Damn shame.

Not sure, what you mean.
---
That's the point of this, somebody has already linked a very helpful site! That's the kinda help I was hoping to get! Good on him :D
---
Hence why they're scripts and not humans. That's a EULA violation but widely done.
---
True, in a sense. Their looks are the manifestation of their sick, twisted minds. After all, think of how many Gallentean officials *approved* of those designs and committed incalculable resources towards their mass production.
---
The Gallente are a cancer and their ships look like flying tumors.
---
This is bait.
---
This may go over your head but:  intentionally breaking the game to solve a problem is different than a bug fix and causes players to make different choices with their time.  I could wait out a bug fix. This is different.  
---
Have fun shooting at nothing
---
&gt;Someone poked out one eye of yours?
---
Not that I know of, though I might do it and become a pirate. I'm not sure why you are annoyed. I've already agreed your understanding of markets is studied and that low PLEX prices are the only real measure of a healthy market. A low demand means that CCP makes MORE money from people buying PLEX and therefore their servers stay on... Keep up the good fight, man. I'm pulling for you to destroy that ridiculous demand!
---
Well, the people I'm working with really wanna do the mining aspect, so it's not really up to me there, plus they might find some nifty blueprints. But I will definetly take your idea into consideration! Thanks!
---
Third time I started Eve I went straight to faction warfare. And its where I stuck along.
---
Maybe they should try to "force" you in a military service after completing the tutorial missions. But show people easy way out of it by doing the sister arc, a mining mission or just a very small sum of isk...
---
Yep, already got some people minig for me! Not sure how much they will make... bit whatever, this isnt competitive yet lol
---
It's likely comes down to server load. Even small things can be taxing if repeated.
---
Or just super disconnected from game news
---
Well good news VNIs got nerfed so you at least have to use something tankier than that.
---
Basically I tried 5 posts to explain quantum physics to an amoeba .. my bad
---
Getting most of the stuff i need for good prices(compared to import them).. But im not an indy guy or something.. It may looks different then v0v..
---
A myrm won't last much longer. But at least it's cheaper.
---
We need to convince the Minmatar to abandon them. It's a weaker allegiance than the ceasefire we have with the Amarr. 
---
I'd gladly trade the brutal functionality of the Minmatar shipyards for the pompous camp of the Amarrians any day, and those flying glitter bombs would mesh well with their tumour cousins. 
---
Think of the profits, too. Selling ships designed to fight instead of meander about like drugged dancers? You never see the Sebiestor wasting half their hull budget on gold trim.
---
Mining is fun. Thats the tricky part. It is of course some specific kind of fun but it is there. You are going to lose players who enjoy this slow low input macro strategic playstyle if you tell them that it is not fun go do something else. Eve struggles to 1) explain the proper ways for each activity 2) tell players that they can and should do something else if they find something not fun
---
lol I paid $60 a month of my real money too dude.  Same mindset as you there kiddo.  When ccp fixes their game maybe I’ll resub them.  Till then just my PvP account is up.  For now.  
---
And I know there’s a stigma on multibox mining afk alt tabbed to porn but that’s not me.  I’d even offer up that meme is way overstated in terms of actual occurrence.
---
#LOUD NOISES
---
Well you're not really the type of people we go for anyways?
---
Nothing is going to stop you from krabbing there's just risk to it now.
---
well the difference between this one and the last one was there was ways for you to not show up in local while others would show up just fine .  So people were happily derping about then getting tackled by a 5 man gang who didn't show in local even though everyone else did
---
I think you vastly overestimate the standing fleet capabilities.
---
And that will be a win regardless.  If those rorqs only come out during protection; then there will either be bored players sitting around, or a bunch of rorqs not making isk.
---
I spent enough time in null to know; the ones there for the combat won’t just be there all the time; and the response capabilities are going to be a lot more difficult without better intel
---
A choice you don't agree with isn't breaking the game. It's you being a whiney bitch. Luckily this sub is all the content I need this week to be happy:)
---
Then on Friday, the servers are gonna take one hell of a beating
---
Autobillings.. bet it retains more players than we know XD
---
*I saw your ship* is on repeat
---
Something, something, don't fall for the flair bait. TEST is stoked for no local, we are fighting FRT remember. I have heard minimal complaints, and those that do get directions to low sec.
---
I don't get it. Are you assuming because there is no local that Mittens and the rest of Goons are fucked?
---
But on the flip side to this... Dkesnt thst mean you'll never find bots unless you specifically look for them?
---
&gt; asically I tried 5 posts to explain quantum physics to an amoeba .. my bad. You don't happen to be a product of the US "school" system? The one that spits out people knowing nothing outside America or even their own county to colleges ?
---
I've done my level best to support your idea that CCP not getting money from PLEX is healthy for the game. What have I done that made you hate me? I'm sorry. I'll be better next time!
---
Wait, V?
---
Is that what that key is supposed to say?
---
^^^^wormholer ^^^^btw
---
nullsec salvaging/looting for supers. around 100-150m/h.
---
just need to get a lot of mtus to keep up if you follow more than one super or titan.
---
Dscan :)
---
Why tf are those absolute twat waffles ALWAYS threatening to burn down hi-sec? Shit's pathetic - like a little kiddie stomping his foot
---
I TRIED.  but between the cold, the volcano, and certain,.....issues with my axe (I SWEAR IT WASN'T RUBBER 5 MINTUES AGO)
---
i figured it would be best to get a live oak treb.  
---
don't worry. we half way through customs...just gotta pass.....the......*looks at "do you have a real life" test*
---
....uh oh
---
cap boosters are overrated.
---
Jokes on you. None of us are competent!
---
If what i predict happen, they should fired dev for that.
---
Yes, apparently the guys with the biggest supercap umbrella will be the worst off.
---
Exactly my thought.  He won't be missed as he was contributing nothing to begin with.
---
There are enough bots that knowing the general vicinity is enough to find some.
---
Man, this is a massive blow to the null lifestyle.
---
A lot of the null activities from botters, to blobs, to standing fleets all rely on a very important unseen force in null; intelligence.
---
Not only has the window greatly closed for warning of an attack, but the willingness to respond as well.
---
Big parties like to know they’re going to overwhelmingly win a fight.  You won’t see capitals used as aggressively because of fear; the possibility that small group is just a trap.  That alone is a huge win for anyone not in the blue donut.
---
I for one embrace the new changes; capital warfare is boring.  I’m excited to see gate camps and roaming gangs again simply to combat everyone else using them too.
---
Pretty pathetic that a cock gobbler like you doesn’t even play the game and yet wishes so much hate upon people who do.
---
I did great solo.. 
---
find a quiet system, not too high or low on the sort list. 
---
Dock up when people roll through (gankers in quiet systems are mostly just non-fw gankers) 
---
save those points always.
---
No problems, a few deaths here and there, like my t1 starter alt's hide is gonna survive against some non-fw bruh rolling 100 times my worth of t2. His killboard is a joke, but my name must grace it sometimes. No salt for Bob here.
---
content is content
---
make an account and come play with us
---
make your own stories
---
Why wouldn't they?? just drop the supers on the drifter fleets
---
What do you reccomend then, I'm open to different manufacturing ideas. For the start st least.
---
Do it and come fly with us
---
Hm, but it is on the other side of the system than the last planet, then you might very well be out of dscan range from any celestial.
---
Historically, everyone has used local chat pilot listings to immediately warp their ships out of combat sites. It's not unique to bots - though this mindset that anyone who immediately warps is a bot *is* unique among redditors.
---
Says the guy who only has to crit the statics and fly's covert ops to avoid risk.
---
Literally didn't happen but okay.
---
Surely there is going to be more? As long as you live under a cap umbrella and don't have a dogshit fit, pop a cyno and call in the bois who are hopefully ready and waiting
---
Need someone easily recognizable and synonymous with nulsec for the meme.
---
Lowsec is more like nobody around at all, most of the time.
---
I'm probably several months if not a little longer off from getting into any real CEO activities but I sure will. Still trying to find some active people to play with who aren't at war lol.
---
Honestly im gonna use my rorq more then my orca now
---
I mean, everything to build t3 destroyers and cruisers can be sourced from wormhole space. Just means more loki fleets.
---
SPACE BAR
---
Yes
---
 just bring them to lowsec.
---
Ehh I landed 60 au off in a system and I'm am pretty sure I am further then any other celestial from the star by 25-30 au.
---
Well then lets close this here with the agreement that the youporn miner is a meme, but every meme has some realistic background. Same as the "passive mining" meme, as it was really not healty before jump range changes. But in my opinion the Meta between Phoebe patch in 2013 and Citadel (2016) / Lifeblood (2017) was the healthiest EVE has ever seen. Tiericide had made T1-Hulls viable again, Lowsec was alive and kicking with many smaller local groups taking all money moons from the former "Kings of Lowsec" thus having fuel for their adventures, and I dont think that nullsec empires were shorthanded in that time. I mean it still took close to all of EVE to bring Goons out of Deklein.
---
And don't said to they it will not hurt bot a lot beacause you breack all they're rethoric.
---
For supercapitals and rorquals, yes. For normal capitals, probably. 
---
For subcaps? Unless they’re bait and multiboxing a super ready to jump, help isn’t going to arrive in time
---
Yup, as soon as a cyno is lit, and a few caps bridge in, suddenly their mom is calling them for dinner, or the street lights are starting to turn on and they gotta go home.
---
If dscan was automated I'd expect perma tidi, or something to the same.
---
A setting perhaps where you can automate dscan on a not so regular basis 'might' be ok, every 60 seconds or something.
---
Wormholer now a null player (probably returning to wormhole soon) , I wouldn't want an automated dscan because this is one of the many things Eve needs to leave untouched to keep risk within the game and to provide extra challenge for a hunter to ge their pray. 
---
For a hunter, automated dscan dscaning at the wrong time to then have to wait for it to refresh to then find your target has gone would be fucking irritating, I'm not as big of a hunter as I once was, even I realise how annoying this would be.
---
If you use a blops cyno you don't seed you just breige ppl in
---
I'm not saying that we're going to see a billion PvE capital deaths per second once the Blackout hits, I'm saying no local is a serious nerf to how null-blocs currently operate.   
---
I'm very doubtful that the supercapital-umbrella PvE meta will end on Friday, but it's going to need to change. We'll see just how things shake-out in a few weeks.
---
Should come and get involved :)
---
you know that more people than just you use your planets right?
---
Yes it works in any system with any size
---
HAHA
---
I dont know why you assume I'm the big scary hunter.  I look forward to a nullsec where the people living there actually need to work as a team instead of endlessly ratting in empty systems.
---
It's not.
---
It's only been like a week tho since the drifter attacks become out of hand and this talk started. Probably takes a bit longer than that to organize a major offensive and get people/stuff moved to the target area.
---
My guess is that, if they do it, they'll wait to a week or two into the blackout and do it then, once it becomes clear how that plays out and they've got a good handle on security down in Delve.

It's a shame that eves entire purpose for the last however many years has been pushing people into big blocs and empire building, maybe a different game is what the people want
---
&gt; Losing a caracal and getting podded
---
&gt; Sounds awful
---
You need to lose more ships.
---
Issue is not lack of things to buy, issue is lack of ppl buying
---
Don't think this has anything to do with WAFFLES. AFAIK they are currently living in j-space.
---
If you put ten's of billions of isk on the field, they should be hard as hell to kill and deal stupid amounts of damage.
---
Hmm, but isnt this way than only viable in smaller systems? If the outer planets orbit is 80 AU from sun and you come out 40-60 AU from sun, than this is no deepsafe i guess? Or do I misunderstand that ?
---
mm i should try again this weekend too
---
Tbh i may have pulled this info out off my bump/discord/reddit :D
---
I am going to brick tank mine. Leave the excavators at home, and welcome the troops. Bubble, cyno, and call for help.
---
What annoys me is the cooldown that was introduced a while ago. Previously you could mash dscan without cooldown, now you can easily miss the tick when a ship is cloaked for 1-2 seconds.
---
Better : remove the game
---
Then we'll take the structures.  And Rorqual pilots don't sub anyway.  Why would they?
---
Very nice, Next time could you teach us some things about EoM ?
---
you know that 90% of eve never get involved in the meta, read the forums or reddit. just look at how few people vote in CSM even with blocks rallying their members. it is going to be carnage.
---
If your alliance doesn’t undock then what’s to stop another Corp/alliance attacking your area and taking your territory?  What is your Corp again? Looking for new real estate ;)
---
I think you vastly underestimate the organisational capabilities of the blocs and just how "stealthy" no local actually is.  A lot of people will be sitting off gates pinging out intel.  It won't be perfect intel of course.  Rorq pilots can spend more time watching on alts than super pilots can, so it'll be a little easier for them. 
---
Otherwise nothing much will change.  When you appear next to a target it'll light a cyno and/or hit panic and call for help.  This is pretty much what happens today.   You can already successfully drop and kill the smoothbrains who don't know where their mic or cyno is (e.g. the Nyx that died to Horde next door to 1dq yesterday).
---
The gameplay will differ as follows:  subcaps won't be using any bling after a while (I would call an exhumer "bling").  The meta will be go poor or go home.  No local is a massive nerf to them.  Luckily I already do this, using Prospect/Endurance for mining and Ishtar for ratting (when I do it).  I may switch out the Ishtar for something that can cloak.  Amazing.  It's 2019 and I'm considering belt ratting.  
---
Umbrellas will have a hard time saving ordinary caps (carrier, dread) as the blobs groups will be bigger and more of a "surprise", so they're also nerfed in effect and they're too weak to last long enough for the counter-drop.  We'll start to see fewer and fewer of them in anoms.     We'll effectively have islands of powerful umbrellas protecting rorquals and supercarriers, and everywhere else will be a sea of emptiness.
---
I'm looking forward to seeing how it plays out and as others have said I wouldn't judge it by the weekend, which will no doubt be mayhem (though when local has gone dark in the past - and it has due to bugs), it wasn't really mayhem.  People just didn't feel safe ratting or mining so on the whole the smart ones at least didn't undock.  People who don't undock to PvE mostly still play, they just undock their umbrella characters and join fleets.  So I expect the umbrellas to be running at full retard this weekend.
---
It expires too soon. Blackout better last longer.
---
This post is fucking amazing. 10/10 lol
---
indeed. as such, why would you need to be sneaky?
---
This will at least shake things up in the short term which will be nice, with any luck the botter deaths will blot out the sun in the interim.
---
If this becomes a more permanent thing I do hope they tie this into structures so there is both play/counter-play/counter-counter-play.
---
After doing PI for years at 125 worlds, I think I am fairly versed and knowledgeable in the whole affair. Thank you for your genuine concern.
---
i like it
---
It's only a 2 second cool down. It could be worse.
---
Fucking smallgangs not wanting to fight afew faxes and supers LMAO pussies
---
Its happening because CCP has been given some undisclosed business goals that they have to meet in order to unlock $200 million in funds from their new owners. 
---
In spite of all their best efforts so far, though, player counts and subs have continued to slowly decline. Nerfing highsec PvP didn't help. Throwing around a lot of new NPCs didn't help. So now they're in "fuck-it" mode, just trying this random thing that's sure to cause major, hard to predict changes to the game.

Not that this is a bad thing. This kind of change seems like a breath of fresh air. It's a bold, somewhat dangerous move by CCP. Hopefully players find lots of ingenious ways to take advantage of it in order to stimulate conflict, create stories, and restore a little bit of what used to make EVE special. I even re-subbed just to see what happens.
---
I still don't understand the problem with end-game ships dominating end game space. 
---
Other than that the changes are going to be very interesting, as they introduce game changing dynamics. Reliable intelligence will be much more valuable, as well as new tactics will develop (bluff attacks for example? Drawing off part of a cap umbrella then launching the real attack?)
---
Laughs in cloaked titan on gate\*
---
Join an existing nullsec or WH corp that does industry and learn from them. T1 industry is not very complicated, but the biggest factor that will make it impossible for you to make any profit on your own in high sec is the refine rates and material efficiency. In null and WH the base refine rate is higher and expensive manufacturing facilities (rigged Sotiyo's) have material efficiency bonuses. Once you have learned and experienced what goes into industry it is possible for you to go out on your own and set something up yourself, but it will require a fair amount of ISK and SP investment.
---
Keep the old system but add a automatic system.
---
When turned on give your ship a warp speed/general speed panelty.
---
Can't be turned on if in warp or cloacked.
---
Then give some ships a reduction to the penalty(combat interceptors, recons?!)
---
Yeah, but it still technically enables a short window without dscan data. I used to mash it like no tomorrow back then, idk, I don't like the new one.
---
bring back advanced audio settings
---
or let us modify game sounds on our own so I can mute all the stupid shit and still hear warnings and wormhole fires
---
It's almost like poking the people who aren't looking for pvp at that moment results in them denying you tour fun too. Crazy
---
Let the fun begin
---
When there's 8 pilots in a system all in the same ship all in the same Corp for the same amount of time and all 8 enter warp at the same time going to the same place I'm sure it's just a group of 8 dudes who really really enjoy staring at local for 23 hours a day.
---
So wspace is now safer than nullsec, clearly that's a reasonable stance for ccp to take.
---
See I'd actually love it if eve was a game about empire building. 
---
But it's not. 
---
Eve is a game about empire *built*. Unless you got in on the ground floor a decade ago, you're shit out of luck. It's literally impossible for any small entity to hold an outpost in non-npc null, let alone sov. 
---
Delete the sov mechanic all together, and the standing system while we're at it. No blues, no borders, everything is conflict. You want to take over half of nullsec? I hope you don't mind being constantly bombarded by people squatting in your system and drifters bombing your shit. Because nullsec should be dangerous.

---
the point of it was a lot of people think kiting and farming some renter trash makes them better than those who do not, yet Ive never seen two good groups going at it.
---
You post demonstrates that you have no real knowledge of the people and the play styles in nul sec. Not everyone mines. Not everyone rats. Not everyone does industry and not everyone scouts. Not everyone is in fleets all day, and not everyone runs freighters. Nul Sec is as diverse a place as any in EvE. But that doesn’t fit your narrative.
---
Jumping in mite good if it works like so.
---
 If you have a cyno beacon in system you jump to that. 
---
If you can get a ship into place and wait for it to wind up, you jump to that.
---
Then if non off the above, maybe give the ability to jump to the system form the map. Leaving you on the edge off the system.
---
Whoa.. 
---
As someone just returning to Eve.. this is a crazy surprise.
---
Biggest fights ever seeb? 
---
Are you serious?
---
We'll have a lot of small gank and gate camps groups in null because they are too small or not enough organized to do the same with normal local active.
---
But hey! They are elite pvp and the rest of Eve are nullbears and F1 monkeys.
---
Let me explain one thing, Eve had big fights because of null alliances, because of F1 monkeys, not elite pvp.
---
Without nullbears Eve probably had closed years and years ago, and nobody will remember this strange excel in space game, that's the truth.
---
Let's CCP play a role while and look to the result, when they realize how much money they lost for all the people unable to play the game they paid for, then we'll see a rollback in no time
---
I'm old. but it's amazing to me that someone can build a program that can interact with a game and do things within the game like circle an asteroid, fire a lazer, return to a station, flee an enemy, etc. i wouldn't have any idea how to build such a thing. fascinating.
---
Why invaded a region when the grass is the same.
---
I was reading something about the Drifters and the attacks they were doing were changing every Wednesday for the past three Wednesdays. Maybe it was the Triglavians? So many factions to keep track of.
---
I've played almost exclusively in nullsec for 13 years now but yeah you're probably right
---
I thought the July 5th article was the 48hrs. warning... Not a article stating that "Blackout" was an upcoming change.
---
hey but they are the guys that CCP should listen to, paying not a cent to CCP but bigmouthing about the game not being catered enough towards them ...
---
There will be things to scan, and shoot. All the whining in the world isn't going to stop this. So you little crybabies go ahead and log off. Nobody is going to miss you anyway.
---
It's almost like you're too retarded to see what I was pointing out. Crazy
---
Oh man, you seem to be really salty about all this.
---
Please do tell us how all that's gonna help achieve anything other than somehow make you feel a little less miserable than you are now.
---
It's on the launcher, you'd have to be pretty dense!
---
Remaining in the abyss through DT should result in destruction of your ship.
---
Change my mind.
---
Sure perhaps in the future my man :) think next video will be angels thought
---
Because if they dscan you and probe you down you may be in a world of hurt.
---
You must be new here.  I've hit spacebar and heard that sound so many times it's blended into my brain.  Now I hear it in my dreams.  
---
And yes, remapping d scan to the spacebar is the appropriate move. So much easier.
---
Who plays with audio on?
---
This is bait, right?
---
That was a good day
---
A cloaked ship isn't a danger to anyone, champ. Come on back when you learn how the game works.

I m not salty.
---
If you make a blackout go to make a full blackout not an half blackout.
---
Indeed, lowsec hmm..
---
Yes, Lower those ADMs for me.
---
I don't think most of these changes are what they need, honestly they could do with just being cheaper ships overall. 1-1.4b for a hull puts them in the same realm as capitals in terms of cost and as mentioned, capitals tend to be more effective.
---
Personally I'd be comfortable pushing them out as solo/gang boats for 500-750m as opposed to the price they're currently at.
---
Remember the gong sound when you killed a target?
---
Every new player we keep in the game is another person to shoot ;)
---
Tbh when the chat broke, EVE became like so much more fun.
---
As a bittervet resubbing for this, your prediction is probably accurate. Most of us really quit because we have lives outside EVE and this immersive hobby is just too much to sustain. That will still be true in a few weeks when the novelty of no local wears off. 
---
Hopefully we'll be replaced by a lot of bright-eyed newbies with no social lives irl, and the great stories and shenanigans of EVE will carry on for generations to come.
---
Want to say Bait But that FEDUP flair makes it a little more convincing.
---
sell now before it goes to 2
---
&gt; I mostly just watch Netflix or play PoE while playing this stupid game so no real change from my end.
---
So you fully admit to being one of this guys just afk-grinding while not really playing this game? On of the guys that needs "automatted tools" to stay safe while being tabbed out ? One that calls somebody that actually plays this game actively when online autist because he killed your afk-ISK-grinder?
---
Please stay logged of after this weekend too, nothing will be missed.
---
I have so much muscle memory built up from back then that I just mash the button 7-8 times anyway even though I know it won't do anything.
---
You don't need a cloaked cyno ship for that?
---
If this is not a **very** clear sign for FedUp's leadership that they really need to come back to LS, I don't know what is.
---
Or well, at least boil this krab.
---
I tried to join a lowsec FW corp, it was uh... Minmatar something? They were *really* inactive on their voice server. I gave up because I never had anyone to interact with and so I just ended up doing solo attempts in a Rifter and getting dropped on by a bunch of Amarrs. 
---
Im truth, though, I was doomed from the start. While I accepted the delayed responses and indirect ship controls, I never enjoyed them. In that same vein, I never enjoyed the need to have the camera so far. If the camera is close, you have to be good at reading the combat overview spreadsheet. I hated having to play the game through text boxes and icons rather than physical ships and physical space. I also didn't care for theorycrafting builds or playing with stats and optimiziations, I didn't care about the many varieties of equipment to fit to the ship. I became frustrated that the game took the "more investment, better results" ship building method. It makes complete sense, and its impact on the game is agreeable given the game's inate nature. But I personally despised it, for I could not succeed in PvP by the limitations it set upon me.
---
It's win win for everyone but big null botters. If the bots don't undock. Prices on everything will fall. If they do then it's a FFA. I see this as an absolute win.
---
The bug wasn't consistent across the whole of nullsec. Not every person was affected by it. 
---
So any data gathered by that was going to be inconsistent and spotty.
---
Do I have to?
---
Can only scan 14au around ya.  It's enough sometimes but in most systems it's not going to cover all gates/stations/dudes camping outside your range.
---
We will see, lol
---
I don't understand why in-game items are going to cause inflation, you'll have *more* blue loot being sold, increasing supply, therefore lowering the price equilibrium. Why would you predict inflation when there are no new ISK faucets?
---
I've gotten some good ones, and then quite a few useless ones, depends on if you are a dick or not I guess :P I'm a newbie, dont expect me to be able to do anything other than float in space lol
---
&gt; fights will happen between groups of people out hunting.
---
This could have happened before, since the begining of eve, however the risk averse goes both ways and as soon as you encounter something that can fight back most 'hunters' run crying.
---
It’s also a huge nerf to super ratting outside an umbrella. 
---
Rorqual mining already was pushed under umbrellas because they needed to siege, but until now anyone could super rat. Now, even more small groups will die or join big coalitions. 
---
Maybe they’ll be replaced by all the new players joining for the no local, but I don’t think those will last long without any real targets to hunt, and I will be very surprised if there are going to be targets
---
Yep, when that happens you can immediately say that none of them are on comms with their corp, in their standing fleet, watching their intel channel, listening to other people talk about how the neighboring system is +1 but they don't know where they're going yet, or even multiboxing - they're always, 100%, without a doubt, a bot. 
---
And we definitely aren't bots, even though we do the same thing when we're ratting.
---
in wormholes its also possible to crit your statics, roll away wandering connections and then just have your probe window open, thats like the safest possible space.
---
Fit for a start, fit standard cynos to a special beacon class of ships for transport, or to other capitals. Get rid of the instant super umbrella.
---
Under the bottom.
---
Seriously, please stop being so stupid. Or at least don't breed.
---
TIA on behalf of the rest of humanity.

I think I am a pretty fair judge of the organizational capabilities of blocs considering I was an FC for 2 of them.

Did the chimera ever get changed from the remodeling like 5 years ago?
---
Eve Dublin might be just too damn expensive on airfare, but a drive to New York, now that I can do.
---
Well that's why if stuff is out of range you warp to the celestials the sites spawn off of and dscan from there. I didn't download this game yesterday.
---
Game in gunna die.  
---
Hey hey hey hey!
---
Teehee
---
You are salty if CCP make a full blackout ... interesting
---
Because one change that effects nullsec requires a counter change that completely rebalances cloak modules? Big yikes.
---
PVP solution please cleanse me of my noobness and help me extract the salt from thy enemies. In BoB's name, amen.
---
&gt; the shutdown of all little entity
---
This really feels like a "think of the children" attitude.

So why didn't you take into account the fact that they will adapt to the new meta - and that includes the standing fleets?
---
IDK if you were a very good FC.
---
https://youtu.be/lj6h9acBTbI
---
again, but why are you seeding a system with 200 bombers?  you don't need to seed shit in null, you can just cyno it in when you want to.
---
1v1 me at the liquor store
---
Not really.
---
I m based on NGSA campaign to said that.
---
Ah, my mistake. Guess there aren't any bots then. Have a nice day.
---
Completely disagree.
---
Granted, there's many ways to play EVE, but you know what I bet a large majority enjoy above all else? Fighting each other in spaceships.
---
Now, I do agree that FW is currently the most reliable means of getting into fights - particularly if you are solo, relatively new or both.  It offers the partial security of Low-Sec, along with the convenience of local trade and a network of what are, essentially PVP arenas.
---
But my God, surely this can't be the best implementation of space PVP?  Granted, I'm simplifying matters, but for all intents and purposes this is pretty much what they are - arenas where you can selectively fight against opponents in various shapes and sizes.  
---
It gets old so fast and plexes are such a dull mechanic. Don't get me wrong - they make for great training grounds, but I dream of a game that enables dynamic, open-world PVP that's accessible to players of all levels and persuasions.
---
Relying on FW to retain players is thinking squarely in the box.
---
Is this a troll?
---
I know what Near2 is, I didn't know what they were meaning by bot though
---
Was going to say... I have a well scripted multibox setup that is not a bot. I have been direct messaged by ig mods to see if I would respond which i always do unless pooping.  
---
Not a bot... but i did learn from them...
---
So i guess that makes me a bot still /s
---
Nope, I just don't see what positive change it would bring to the game, and you are failing to explain it because you are busy masturbating to your "no KM" moronic idea thinking it's somewhat brilliant.
---
although I have read something a while ago that very low taxes (ie 0.0 or 0.1) allow for more market manipulation of prices because its cheaper to place the orders and price walls etc.
---
perhaps higher taxes have had an effect on the PLEX traders?
---
However I would be more likely to believe its PVPers resubbing and splashing some dollars on PLEX to get set up.
---
boo hoo i'm late to the party on a 16 year old game and i think i should have the same advantages as people who have been playing and working towards it for much much longer than me.
---
Someone enters local then all vni pilots warp to the closest keepstar. Especially when they are ready to do so after hearing taco alerts for 10 minutes. Do you expect them to wait for you?
---
Lmao
---
I think you overestimate the willingness of combat pilots willing to stay as a standing fleet for rorqs.  And I’m a realist; the standing fleet is a solid idea, but you won’t keep players around that are bored.
---
It was awesome
---
Welcome mate! Have fun!

Whilst i won't deny the retardation, i am pretty sure i got your extremely clever use of sarcasm ...
---
The goonie salt in this thread is real
---
He didn't say there aren't bots. Consequently, replying to him with a snarky straw man to argue that there ARE bots, as if you're scoring argument points with the guy who didn't say otherwise in the first place, just makes you look like a moron to anyone who can comprehend and think.
---
Sure. There are dudes out there running multiple bots in a system and they all warp out immediately on a hostile entering local. But there are also players who rat at the keyboard and saw you coming 6 jumps out on Intel channels and were prepared to warp all their guys out quickly; they're not botting, but it is easy to complain they are because you're not getting any kills.
---
I uses to smartbomb rat in esoteria. For years. I always was actually playing, but between near and simply paying attention I never even had a hostile ship land on grid before my ships were in warp, let alone tackle me. Even fucking blues would claim I was botting. Stupidity knows no limits.
---
I think you're putting too much blame on one third-party intel tool. Even without Near2 (or TACO or vIntel or the countless other programs) you would still have chat logs and intel channels and they would still be of use with or without local no matter what either of us think.
---
Regardless it would be difficult to counter intel programs (this is hardly specific to Delve and I do PvP believe it or not) without removing chat logging, so I'm not really sure if it's worth being upset over.
---
I'm in favor of something like this - but I would rather see fitting be a little tighter(higher CPU) and certain ships get a bonused reduction, like cloaks. Another idea is fuel amount, increasing the amount would make it more meaningful.
---
A reduction in lock range/scan res would be pretty punishing as well. A reduction in received remote repair, or disabling remote repair entirely, would also vastly increase risk in using it.
---
Overall they aren't in that bad of a spot right now, but this isn't a bad idea.
---
I turned off UI sounds, that fixed it.  Also atmosphere sounds because I got tired of the sound of Citadel tethers.  More advanced audio options would be nice.
---
I have some very valuable assets (mostly modules) in nullsec from when I played years ago that I cannot access physically. Do I have any options to retrieve or at least sell or maybe contract them?
---
Yeah, because that's totally what I said anywhere in any of my messages.
---
I mean you’re not wrong. I just realized after my Millionth D-scan. Ain’t nobody in fucking wormholes anyway. And if they are they’re too lazy to go 1-2 jumps and will 90% of the time roll into you. Which can be noted by a new signature.
---
Outside of looking for offline pos’s with XL-SMAs and targets. I’m way too lazy for that shit.
---
I didn’t know what I was doing against the itching, but when I bought the PVP scrub solution my skin calmed down and I was able to find the lock button for my PVP ships again!
---
&gt; that CCP not getting money from PLEX is healthy for the game.
---
You still on the completely wrong track ... but I guess (or better HOPE) you just bored and think trolling onreddit is a nice timekiller ...
---
I was expecting a video of a VNI... just put a decent tank and a cyno on your fucking isk printer and be done with it.
---
We don't have infinite anomalies in WH. Rolling helps, but you can't warp carriers from site to site without ever running out.
---
Other way actually.
---
I can imagine how many spodbrains will lose their shit
---
OP joining goons confirmed
---
You know how to retain players?
---
Have them *do anything* in the game with friends.  Because they'll keep showing up to play with their friends.
---
It doesn't have to be lowsec.  Or null.  Or WH.  Or highsec.  Any place in the game where people play together and feel like they are letting someone down if they stop showing up will retain players.
---
It's great that it's lowsec for you.  Doesn't mean that lowsec is the hook for everyone.
---
I think this is going to benefit a very small group of players while actively hurting the vast majority. Prices of everything are going to up, probably a lot. Maybe all of that is good, maybe not. It's probably not going to help new player retention though.
---
You mean remapping it to one of the mousebuttons is the appropiate way.. because i can be ar*ed to use two hand when playing eve.
---
I like the sound because when I press the button and I don't hear it, it reminds me that I have my cursor in a chat window.
---
Not to mention it isnt hard for a null bloc to have scouts on gates watching for hostiles and everyone watching for new sigs. Quite a few folks at the end of pipes already would do this with a pod off a gate, looking at gate, glancing at it when gate fire noises, etc.
---
Any particular reason you ignored the fact that all these pilots are the same age with the same amount of time in Corp? I've literally seen it before. 4-5 systems in a row with 8 pilots made on the same day and added to the same Corp within minutes of each other. Furthermore, I live in a wormhole with a nullsec static. When we go hunting they don't have 10 minutes of warning because we show up on their doorstep and yet when we jump into system and warp into their sites they all warp out at the same time. Are they all bots? Certainly not. Do we ever catch them? Yeah sometimes if we're lucky on the warp ins. Is it highly fucking suspicious? Yes, yes it is.
---
There must be something wrong with my head then, because I like the D-Scan sound. If I don't hear it, it means I've got a chat window active and any commands I try to give will just be a string of gibberish for someone else to read. How often have you left your drones out in the Void because of commands being sent to chat instead of the game?
---
Nah that's too extreme... keep covert cynos working.
---
I dont care. Confidence has been burned so sticking to 4-4.
---
I'm finding low class space to be much busier.  Obviously less chance of a major fleet v. fleet showdown, but anecdotally I've seen a bunch of smaller gang stuff around.
---
you wanna show me on the retribution where the bad volta touched you?
---
I'm okay with this. Covert cynos are balanced at least.
---
Rename it the siege tank IN SPAAAAACE
---
That's true.  I shut down the game window when I'm bored.  Everybody does.  I think it's a question of *mass* (as most things in war are).  It won't be possible to assemble a 500-man dread bomb (espionage) but it will be possible for some alliances to ping a 500-man cap/supercap fleet.
---
The only thing that could happen is over-enthusiastic umbrella members fatiguing themselves needlessly.
---
Nah he had a HS direct WH
---
you might be surprised at the number of people who only want to gank and not actually face someone that might kill em.
---
Isn't that just a siege tank?
---
I wish you and your merry men good fortune in the coming weeks.
---
Naw, you're just being a pedantic peasant, that's all.
---
I guess you have a fancier mouse.  I've got a side button for comms, otherwise that's it.  And I'm always using my left hand for ctrl-click, etc. so it's already on the keyboard.
---
And resubscribing to go whale hunting in 3......2........1........
---
Clicking on PornHub, you mean?
---
Well...I mean, technically everything is in space.
---
Culture is so goddang important to enjoying this game. It's the biggest thing new CEO's overlook when the start up their brand new corp that's going to do everything with blackjack and hookers, then start recruiting people out of the blue.
---
Join public chats, roam with them without being in corp, fly around and have fun before you decide on joining any smaller group. If the CEO is being a douche and trying to force you into his corp before socializing with anyone, something is majorly wrong and they probably have some very shitty people in them. The "Kill yourself" and "did you just assume my gender!?" types.
---
Well you don't recognize any of the hallmark behaviors exhibited by bots as evidence that a given pilot might be a bot, so that would be the logical conclusion of your way of thinking.
---
BONG BONG BONG

How is that different than 80% of null?
---
Wait what ... contacts please.          
---
I can get behind this kind of VMT
---
"and nothing of value was lost" - CCP (probably)
---
you leaving is what hypes me
---
&gt; FW space is perma cyno jammed, capitals cannot also use gates in the area. (inability for them to exist in the area can be also introduced) you have area when sub capitals matter, no normal cyno drops are possible even with subcaps
---
perma jamming fw space wont help it in the least, fw ls already is an area where subcaps matter because plexes only take subcaps in the first place(except for larges but still no cyno so yeah). The problem with caps/supers in is not that caps can be used there, its that the mechanics that make subcaps the focus are made irrelevant by citadels, citadels are the problem, limiting capitals will only make the area worse for everyone. And I say this as someone who hates caps with a passion.
---
This idea that ls needs to be for new players and shit is just bad, let the characteristics of the space decide the playstyles and don't standardize an entire area of space with these preconceptions(regardless of ccp's original intent i might add). Lowsec will never be as good for the new player interested in krabbing for the simple fact that it has a lot of movement, even if the isk making opportunities had the same low bar as null. Pound for pound lowsec is probably just second to whs in player skill, trying to turn that necessarily into a new player breeding ground is not realistic.
---
The "problem" with snuff in lowsec right now is not an issue of the area itseld, but an issue of citadels and titan mechanics.
---
The average wdn fleet is like 5-10 dudes in bombers and recons, and we actually don't fleet up as often as you may think. We fight what we can.
---
Yeah you're right. This game needs more people to fill all this space.
---
My 40k man coalition will defend it
---
Our dependable torpedo drivers would never while on duty!
---
Hilmar said in an interview/panel a while ago that CCP needed to shake things up (paraphrasing.) I suspect this is a big step towards that.
---
Surely you can get two people from your alliance to keep guard for everyone and notify people if invaders come in.  If thats really not possible maybe your empire isn't as strong as you thought...
---
If you buy just to put on buy order instantly. Then it matters.
---
I actually don't, what is that?
---
Straw man? That was a real actual example of something I saw while hunting. And yes, I used to live in nullsec too I know intel channels exist.
---
Obligatory, “Eve has sound?”  😂
---
Well, with the recent 15% plex sale and 50% off star packs, it's likely not going to be falling for that long. Just a dip due to a bump in supply.
---
Trust me they’ll be crying harder than you very very soon.
---
&gt;Personally I think CCP needs to lay it out very clearly what will be fun and not.
---
Every thing in the game is fun to someone.  There's no way for CCP to know which things you will find fun.
---
From your post, I suspect you would hate the spreadsheet-heavy industrial life....and it's what I find more fun than anything else in the game.

Pvp krabs: “Wtf reTARD that’s dumb as shit hur why wud u think intel should leave how else would we know where to go kill”
---
I have respect for inner hell but zero respect for your posting friend.
---
Saw that last night and it didn't look to me like RMT.  The RMT thing is just a meme at this point.  As you say who's going to trust 95 bill to a random number generator?
---
I suppose if you control a region of bots you probably would.  You'll earn that in a day.  It's just too obvious though.  CCP would surely spot it a mile off.
---
... or would they?
---
Same. It's juicy but at the same time really scary, EVE can't handle that many bad business decisions at this point in time.
---
No. We need somewhere to collect our salt
---
No dedicated core gameplay...
---
That’s the point, and yet, there is at least someone doing a bit of everything, or the full range of ships and equipment wouldn’t be available on the market.
---
And there wouldn’t be people hunting me everywhere I huff and explore, and there wouldn’t be a constant stream of explores for me to kill, and there wouldn’t be groups of PvP corps coming through for us to have scuffles with.
---
Awesome! Now I have something to watch today! Thank you!
---
When you join a relevant null bloc maybe youll understand how creating an army of vni alts is piss easy. Thats why they are all created at the same time
---
Your guess on rationale is correct. It would be way too many calls to the server to enable automatic scanning for all players. That's why it is manual and there's a slight cooldown on it(2 secs). 
---
There's going to be some players that are going to think they're smart and are going to try to macro it. I can't wait for the bans CCP hands out for that.
---
I dont know the exact mechanics but I do know if you type in local your name stays in local for a set amount of time whether you leave system or not.
---
As opposed to Ratting carriers that can summon 10 more carriers and a few Titans instantly.
---
Lol, rapid heavy phoon with neut and grappler...
---
I still had some oldschool ~500AU deep safes in my catalogue, I wonder if they still work.
---
Awesome. I've wanted local muted for years. I hope this lasts a while.
---
Options:
---
1) Be the guy who deals with the Stratios.  You'll find a lot of people just need *someone* to step up and organize it.
---
2) Start an alt in some other part of the game to check out that gameplay, use your null income/bankroll to fund it for now.  Quit your null corp if it ends up being more fun.
---
3) Quit until you want to play again.

Well that's your first problem
---
I got myself a buncha bags and I’m gonna sell it to McDonald’s.
---
Honestly, given how many people are thinking they're suddenly going to be dunking the majority of Delve, I expect the Standing Fleet won't suffer from boredom.
---
Even then, odds are half of the fleet are in it for something to do while their own Rorquals are doing their thing.
---
Just watch the situation, If CCP is scared and goes back to Lifeblood-CapitalMining-with-99%-safety-Meta, you can be sure that PLEX will rise above your 4 Bil. again as more people supplying PLEX with their CCs will quit the game and the demand of all that non-paying plexxed accounts will be up again and growing ...
---
what probably happens is an alpha bot sits on grid with the in gates and when a hostile shows up on his overview everything warps off or something
---
Dance with the Dead would like a word with you....
---
Yeah but that gives us time to dscan sites to know we're going to the right one and get into warp with an interceptor before they respond by warping off.
---

I think we will more of a rise in low sec PVE tbh

Can I have what are mobile scan inhibitors for 200, Alex?
---
Dumbass*
---
Stop licking the salt wheel already. Your post sounded like you were trying to lick it then swallow it whole.
---
&gt; but i do think dinkle has a point in saying, that Wormholes and Null are different in many regards, so the same local treatment does different things to them.
---
and who is contesting that? im yet to see anyone say with a straight face that the lack of null local would be good because whs dont have it and they're good, the ones making the ridiculous claim that the thing differentiating wh from null is local are in the nullkrab group.
---
&lt;&gt; okay
---
Yeah you are right thou I didn't try it out in such big systems and these are rather rare.
---
We had about 5 t1 cruisers, but yeah it was still overkill.
---
Nope!
---
Not sure how they don't know what a plex vault is.
---
How do you sleep at night?
---
why are these all "not equal"?
---
If jumping to a system is ever possible, it should be to a predictable place, like zero at the sun. So if you do it blind everyone knows where to catch you.

If you're a drop in the ocean, it's because you're not trying to be more than a drop in the ocean.  Which is fine, but you can't expect space-importance to just be thrust upon you.

Middle mouse for comms.
---
Kill FW missions. They incentize mindless farming and bots to get a side T5 for farming and then flipping to the other side for selling.
---
Most serious mission farmers (including much of the militias) have alts on both sides so they can farm T4/T5.
---
Make it so stabbed ships cannot plex larges. Make it so ventures cannot deplex.
---
Then the LPs will be worth a lot (eventually when everyone to 10m+ LPs as sold off) and the plexes will be a feeding frenzy of pvp.
---
You can activate this mode yourself, you know...
---
As a Krabber, I'm still gonna Krab, just with less asspensive drones. Problem solved.
---
Yes always! Print up and post the damage type for all the rat races. I still reference it all the time and I’ve been playing eve for several years already. Wrong damage type will just tickle the rats. Don’t waste your valuable time! Tip almost always the damage that does the most damage to them is also the resists you should be equipping as well!
---
Are you the type that just downloaded a mining macro and are doing this, or did you do real shit to get trillions of isk and break the game?
---
I can understand your accent pretty clearly but I'm really struggling understanding sentences with your inflection and delivery. I wish I had more constructive recommendations but I hope you pursue this further!  
---
Content is fantastic. NPC Pirate lore in EVE is fascinating.
---
Close thread. The players always had the power.
---
I assume a blind jump would leave wake so they know where you landed. maybe even give a warp in.
---
They already did lose there mind and didn't login
---
Thank you CCP, that is right as my vacation starts. let the good times roll.
---
Lol.  No, Eve isn't like that, unless your story is crying which I suppose it may be for some.
---
Eve is an exercise in frustration that you become accustomed too.  It's days and weeks of utter boredom interspersed with literal minutes of abject terror.
---
I never recommend it but I do enjoy playing it.
---
straw man
---
/ˌstrô ˈman/
---
noun
---
an intentionally misrepresented proposition that is set up because it is easier to defeat than an opponent's real argument.
---
Rather than addressing the argument in the post above (that not all ships who easilu avoid hunters are bots and how Reddit like to yell about instant warp bots), you spouted off an extreme example as if it was relevant to what he said, in order to think you won a point. That sounds close enough to me.
---
this is stupidity, even if it's also RMT.
---
If you can't learn it's not the game's fault.
---
I lose about 25% of the 1v1s I take. I leave or the other side leaves about 25%. I win probably 40%. We get blobbed the rest of the time.
---
In the beginning, I lost everything almost and it's normal.
---
Stick a jump clone nearby, like Kakakela.
---
Cheating looks like a pain in the ass tbh
---
I say we burn down high sec to send a message to CCP that if nullsec is bored and miserable so will everyone else be bored and miserable.
---
CCP had the balls to, I mean so...
---
I will be using mine the exact same amount of time that I've always used it. Which is some of the time.
---
Was gonna say, probably need to put in a bulk order.
---
Very very happy about this.  Eve local chat made the game easy.  Makes dscan skills important.   Looking forward to all the good fights this will bring.  No way for krabs with out a gatr scout to know your coming..and no way for aggressors to know if there are 100 people in local waiting for them.
---
yeah you were in moas lmao
---
Resubbed for this!! W00t!!
---
4) AFK Dominix is pretty nice. Similar ticks (in Forsaken Hubs/Rally Points), cap stable perma-rep, not reliant on Faction Warfare LP grinders to stock the market so they can be built locally. Can survive a bit better if something small tries to come and gank them. Put a few large neuts in the highs and gtfo when they lose point. Can also fit a cyno much more easily to use for baiting hunters. So now randomly some % of AFK Domis could be bait.
---
&gt;then he/she should DIE !  
---
He or she did die; what're you complaining about?
---
It's not a proposition you dimwit it's a fucking observation. The reason r/EVE redditors are so salty about botting is because most of us encounter it regularly and are sick and tired of it ruining the game's economy and want something to be done about in the long term.
---
Hmmmm that looks like my store room at my hospital. 
---
I know you are not but ill just enjoy the idea of a secret eve player hiding amongst my coworkers.
---
I think i will switch to pvp more and stream all the time. Way more fun and content !
---
Eve is special in that it seems I can find 30min+ video guides on just about any topic/question I search for.

Let me suck this rock while pressing my panic button while watching thees puppies on twitch getting exited about some Rorqual and don’t mind those red flashes next to me.

Future krab demand for reimbursement 
---
*dear ccp 
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. Thank you and I expect all my losses to be returned to me expeditiously.
---
that shouldn't be too hard considering that most of highsec's population is already gone
---
Fuck it dude, shut down zkill for the weekend. Zero intel gameplay.
---
A little of both, actually. I'm serious that your original statement
---
is not well considered. If no PVE (as in the probable majority of the game's players) accounts were plexed and the non plexing accounts were maybe 20% of the total PVE accounts (which I personally I think is a low guess) then 20% of the demand for new PLEX will vanish. Sure there is a large stockpile but the prices will crash as people compete to unload their product. The buying activity will necessarily decrease both for iskl and for cash as PLEX becomes a less viable source of PVP income. I'm a small fry but I have several thousand PLEX ready for a quick cash injection and I'd quit buying altogether if the proces moved drastically down.
---
You are correct in stating that the PLEX already purchased with CCP RMT is accounted for but if you depress the market, you depress future sales.
---
Does this mean CCP will actually shut down? Probably not but for you to say they won't notice is laughable, especially given the wait periods for the sale and the need for ongoing income metrics. It's part of the reason why CCP can't get rid of extractors; they NEED that source of income both for operations and to stack the bonus money higher for the final tally of the sale to BDO. CCP are watching the income streams more than ever now so a 20% or more drop in PLEX sales would absolutely be noticed.
---
He's complaining that he lost a ship when he went into a situation where ship loss was likely

Nice production value and cool presentation overall but holy shit please get someone with a good command of English grammar to proof-read the text before committing it to video next time.
---
&gt; there are no outgoing roaming holes to wormhole space from a C5, only static connections.
---
You sure about that? That would mean all connections in a 5 are static or K162. Pretty sure I've also seen "wandering" wh connections spawning on the C5 side, but now you confuse me 😁
---
Yeah lowclass space gets a lot of traffic. I’m referring to mainly highclass space.
---
Lowclass space is akin to lowsec without local.
---
Pls no,  I like to read the tears and memes
---
Yep everyday! Join Welp Squad.
---
I miss the days of begging that rare titan pilot to give you a jump clone because you refuse to grind up standings. And then how enraging it was when it died. And then you realize you didn't update your one either and now that you are dead you are updating it because "never again" and you realize it cost 90 mil to update my clone ahhhhhh REEEEEEE
---
Hi, welcome to deep space. Its cold, the air is a bit on the thin side, and the anomalies &amp; pirates don't give a shit if you're PVE or PVP fit  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
You need to tell us what you are interested in, there is so much so much to learn in EvE, it would take awhile explaining everything.
---
Meh
---
&gt;  within the game like circle an asteroid, fire a lazer, return to a station, flee an enemy
---
All of those things take one button click.  The server figures out the orbit path, and returning to a station and fleeing an enemy are often times the same button.
---
i downloaded aimware ama
---
Shitpost means low effort. As long as you put a minimal amount of effort you’re good to go.
---
As for this idea I think that CCP should actively avoid any new implementations that would make hunting and pvp more difficult.
---
In 90% of the low sec systems it’s hard enough as is to find fights.
---
That's like saying because all websites have sitemaps, there's no reason for Google?
---
Like Google, Near2 **simplifies** the **organization and dissemination** of the intel. Sure, a lack of local isn't going to "kill" Near2, but it's going to require a lot more manual effort on the part of the scouts/intel reporters in order to keep their PvE-ers "up to date" so to speak. And even then, since it's reliant on Dscan, the best you'll get is "two frigates spotted in *System*". At least, that's my takeaway from this.
---
I guess lowsec is fun if you don’t have to worry about ISK making. Are L4 missions in a bomber still possible? And I guess L5 with carriers is doable. Much easier in null though
---
And nothing of value was lost.
---
how has no one realized that this is a war thunder shitpost
---
its literally in the title yall
---
No dscan
---
No combat scan
---
No overview.
---
When you think about it, it's all free intel.
---
vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
---
This is a copy / pasted message, but fell free to answer it if you have any questions.
---
First of all, take the time to do the career agent missions. It will show you many things in the game (exploration, mining, industry, hauling, etc).
---
Then, well Eve is a sandbox, so you will need to figure out what you want to do. As a new player, you are not strictly limited, but what ever you do, Eve can be dull and boring, mechanics are complex at first because of the amount of informations you need to learn but once you understand them it's generally a lot easier. What ever you want to do, try to have fun or enjoy the complex interactions mechanics are creating, so basically don't grind isk for the sake of grinding isk.
---
- Want to explore the stars alone ? Buy an exploration frigate, a cloaking device and go around the stars looking for data and relic sties. Maybe join a wormhole corp and enjoy space where frontiers change everyday, and need scanning on a daily basis. There are some newbie friendly wormhole corps that can teach you the way of Bob.
---
- Want to join one of the large nullsec empire ? Join TEST, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet or Brave. They are all well known newbie friendly corporation/alliance and they will give you free ships, a place in fleet, and people are generally willing to teach you. They also offer good opportunities for new players to make isk (exploration and salvaging mainly).
---
- Overwhelmed by large organizations but still want to join an active PvP corp ? Try and look for a small faction warfare corp or alliance, there are plenty of them and they will also guide you, get you a place in fleet and you will enjoy endless content.
---
- Want to settle in a bit more in "security" ? Run some combat mission in HS. But try not to do that, really.
---
- Want to become the space Rockefeller ? Look into market, region trading, and all the shit. You won't blow space ships but if you enjoy raw data, data analysis (like, real data analysis) this is your thing. Isk revenue is potentially infinite.
---
- Want to mine rocks and turn them into modules, ships, ammunition ? Start mining and industry. Pro tip, don't do it alone in HS you don't have a single chance, join Goons (= Karmafleet), nullsec have way more valuable ore and Goons are basically the safest most organized industry in the game. You can also join some renter corp but that's up to you.
---
- Want to build your own corp ? Build it with some friends, maybe to do industry, or PvE, or PvP. My 5 isk : FW is a really good way to make isk and have some fight for new players. Low class WH can also be interesting.
---
A short list of advice :
---
- [This is your bible](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)
---
- Right clic EVERYTHING.
---
- Eve is a sand box, figure out what you want to have fun doing and don't bother what other thinks. There is no right way to play Eve.
---
- Faction do not matter. Pick one you feels seems cool and then ignore it for ever since you can fly any ship of any faction without any difference.
---
- Eve is also a dangerous game. Don't use ships you can't afford to loose. Both players and NPCs can wreck you quite fast, even later in the game when you will fly big expensive ships.
---
- People will kill you. No matter where you are, people can and will kill you, even in high security space. HS is actually the worst place to be, because you think everyone is friendly when it's really not the case. Outside, it's a lot more easier, everyone is your enemy.
---
- The very same people that will kill you can also be the same people that will explain to you why you died if you ask them. People in the game are generally friendly and don't mind teaching new players.
---
- Don't get attached to your ships.
---
- Eve shine when played with other people. Don't be afraid of recruitment policies, knock at the door, join a corp, have fun with others.
---
- Learn of your mistakes, don't get angry. If you died, it's your fault.
---
- r/evenewbies it's a good place to ask stupid question. r/evejobs it's a good place to look for a corp.
---
I actually cant tell if this is a troll post or not.
---
Local shows you who is in the same pocket of space as you. 
---
Someone new jumps in system and you instantly are made aware of it and can react accordingly. You may not know what they are flying but you know who they are and if they are friendly, neutral, or enemy. Usually if not friendly you are docking up or hiding till they leave.
---
This change has two major impacts.
---
\#1 you now have no idea who is in system with you. Bots will have very little warning now and will be much easier to track down and obliterate. With out knowing who is in system you have to spam Dscan which will give you anywhere from 2 minutes to a few seconds of notice before an enemy lands on you. Massively game changing.
---
\#2 Attackers will no longer know if someone is in a system. Before hand someone could just roam systems and look for targets of opportunity. Someone not paying attention, watching netflix, etc and get an easy kill. Now they will have to enter the system and do a full scan to see if anyone is there and that can take 5 - 10 minutes depending on ship size, false positives, space junk etc. Considering how much of 0.0 is ACTUALLY empty it will make finding targets in some ways much more difficult.
---
Obviously #2 has a few catchalls. Dotlan and in game resources can show you what systems are most active by your targets and you can simply go there but this means if people spread out it could be a real pain in the ass.
---
No one’s dropping caps to save a VNI. Or a Rattle. Or probably even a carrier. Rorqs and supers, yeah, but that’s not different from today.
---
It was pretty clear from the first reply that people were under the impression that you were mocking the new player for taking a long time to save up 100m. 
---
All these responses could have been avoided by you clarifying that it was a genuine question, instead of needlessly dragging things on by pretending to be completely oblivious.
---
aaaaand the Gen-X evolution into Boomers 2.0 continues...

You have abyssal arenas if you want artificially limited engagements.
---
God I just unsubbed quietly.  Why you never go more than month to month. Who can trust ccp with any longer of a commitment at any one time?
---
We'll see. I think a small group of people will be happy about it (the hunters) while it actively hurts the larger population and new player retention. It'll certainly shake things up, but I'm not sure it's going to be a good thing overall.
---
If you’re talking blops with a cloaky camper, you might see it in local but you don’t know they’re active until they decloak on someone. So the surprise factor’s the same, it’s then a matter of how the Rorq pilot responds (have you cleared the inhib, did you light before it went active, etc) and then about having a competent FC online to orchestrate the cap response before the Rorq’s panic runs down.
---
There are many ideas based on radar/sonar you can do with dscan that aren't 2003 game design as the current dscan is.  It's code that literally hasn't been iterated on since the beta (alright, maybe the code has - the design certainly hasn't).
---
Anyone who mentions *yet more* infrastructure ("observatories") rather than something based on player skill for discovering intel can GTFO though.
---
I'd be surprised if they don't end up modifying the UI to show a big "CHAT IN LOCAL MODE" in the user list part of the chat window.
---
Exactly what I was typing on eve online forums. If you remove local in null than balance it via removing some info from in game map. Like how many npc rats were killed or how many active players are in system. And remove this info from api so dot lan will not be able to show it too. Make it harder for hunters too via these changes. Not only harder for hunted with no local...
---
Thanks, very helpfull! Good advice, and I'll check all those links out.
---
It’s impossible to make a safe that is outside of dscan from the closet celestial afaik. The game won’t let you initiate warp to it
---
Can I leave them when I'm set up? Is it possible to learn without being under someone? I'm in a group and would prefer not to have to join another
---
That is what you generally do - hunker down on the spod with your faxes in standing.  I think we may need more than one fleet though.  Those dread bombs are going to be larger than usual as they can sneak around to an extent now (notwithstanding those annoying regional gates that are guaranteed to have 20 sets of eyes on them 24/7 from Sat onwards).
---
ur just mad that u wont have any ships to fly after he quits lmfao
---
Yearly sub on three accounts since 2011.  Zero regrets.
---
In various chat channels like the in game Help or Rookie channel ask about new player roams. Different groups do them once a month. They go super slow and take you out on group roams. Very fun. Redemption Road is one of my favorite. Did solo and didn’t like it was about to quit. Until I realize the real fun is group fighting.
---
When I last mentioned that most of WH content comes from nullsec I was told that this is not correct. 
---
Then why wormholers cannot fight each other? Why they rather leave than use and improve small gang warfare?
---
It promotes certain fits and approaches. But it's perfectly valid and enjoyable to some. It does mean that punching into a plex that has someone in it is always risky and that's arguably a good thing.
---
It even links to the BL shitpost sphere video.
---
kikimora lol ur dreads r dead
---
My god man, I hope you get out this weekend and take some of that salt out on vnis. Sounds like you got blue/bot balled a few times, feel better fam. (hugs) genuine tho
---
Is it true that you can enable local after CCP removes it using your el33t hacking skills?
---
You'd have to shut down Dotlan intel tools too, but I'd be down with that.
---
For a while they really weren't dying all that much. With the removal of the triple ancil fit, defensive nerfs to the Indy core, and the addition of trig ships that's changed
---
Oh don't worry, we've got our plans &gt;:)
---
Gud shit!
---
That’s what all other theme park MMOs do. They constantly tune until players do what they are supposed to do and never leave “true” ways to do that. Is this the future you want for EVE?
---
I've heard that this game is much more fun playing with others. I would love to be part of some big clan, or corporation I think it's called here. But not one that demands you to be online every day or something... I've seen that in many other games. Mauti404's comment set me on the right track now though, I think I got my answer!
---
Which will affect profit.  It’s a balance.  They see fights means the rorqs aren’t out.  Rorqs are out means they aren’t seeing fights
---
Thanks, don't return please
---
You can light a covert cyno out of dscan range, then bridge in the bombers with basically 0% chance of being scanned down or detected.
---
If you lit the covert cyno within scan range there is always the chance a friendly neighborhood boson could find the bombers on their way in.
---
Omg you can hit space bar to activate Dscan?? This is a game changer. I’ve been using the cursor for years. This will save me time!!
---
OK, I wasn't criticizing miners or calling you weak. I was just responding to the empire building part.
---
no that’s wrong
---
!Subscribe
---
Oh sad
---
A "ping" about someone DScaning in the system sounds both like a shitty idea to favour ratters in a not-so-different way as local benefits them, that doesn't even contemplate that this would completelt fuck over wormholers, and a really annoying thing to have while playing.
---
The ranges based on ship types might actually be a good idea, depending on how it's implemented it could give a more distinct role to "hunter" ships.
---
Actually you know what might be even more fun (assuming it's possible, of course)?
---
Scramble/Hide/Otherwise obfuscate posters' names and flairs for the duration of the blackout. It'd be interesting to see how things differ.
---
There's going to be plenty of people mining and producing ships. A lot of them see the upcoming blackout as opportunity.
---
Its pretty easy to understand man. He's defending botting because he probably bots.
---
I'd prefer a moderation blackout.
---
Not a 'tear-free' formula
---
Hardstyle dutch duo heres the song https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6nkuxVZ0qPE
---
Marauders definitely have a place already.  Super fun for ballers with perfect skills and lots of ISK.  They're good in both PVE and PVP in high, low, and null, and they're perfect ships to buy stupidly-priced modules for.
---
Still though, given that a carrier (or even a dread sometimes) has similar/comparable DPS, much better survivability, and minimal risk to the wallet, it's kind of tough to find a use for a marauder if you can use a capital.  They're also the T2 DPS battleship so it would be hard to overbuff them, especially as solo boats against subcap gangs.
---
Most people have some sort of risk/reward competent to choosing a ship to fly.  Being immobile in Bastion is super risky outside of high sec missions, and you kind of need to know if you can win the fight before you take it (and that's usually a bad idea if someone can light a cyno).  People who fly marauders also want to be able to pull off wild shit to justify the risk, so marauder PVP can be kind of one-dimensional with the fights that go down. 
---
Just thinking, they could do some cool things with it.
---
- targeted micro jump drive: extended range, maybe you could either jump to a locked target and/or being able to jump anywhere within a certain radius around your ship.  They could use the fighter mechanic for carriers to target a spot.
---
- drastic mjd cooldown: would allow for pilots to develop new flying styles and all that, faster-paced
---
- bastion mode could engage mjd and/or weapons buffs, but tbh, as it is, it really just serves to impose risk (with the immobility) on using such a strong ship, but the game has changed since then and people have a lot more SP now.  With so many caps (and really just available counters), you can counter them without relying on time-&gt;n+1 to prevent them from becoming too strong.
---
- you can tweak whatever else too.
---
Good god.  Of course they'll fuck it up.  That's all part of the fun.
---
Yes. Yes it is.
---
Because EVE should be adaptive and changing, and players should not be able to optimize it into oblivion. 
---
Spawn rates effect income, and income effects the market, and the market determines if EVE lives or dies.
---
I'm betting the only differences will be:
---
1) less rorquals / miners mining and carrier/supers ratting; in smaller groups who dont enjoy a super cap umbrella. The powerblocks will be business as usual
---
2) a lot more roaming gankers with bigger blue balls then before
---
3) inflation across the board (save for plex due to all the apparent unsubber rage)
---
4) after a week or two everything returns to normal OR Ccp release a new alliance level upwell structure that restores local operation (with an ACL list REEEEEEEEEEEE) for an hourly fuel cost
---
5) maximum reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee's from elite VNI killing "pvp" squads
---
Something something blackout and police brutality memes. Something something, please don’t drop on us we just wanna weeewoooo
---
No but you can still taunt people in local ... oh, wait
---
u/squizz make it so... please...
---
I love how all of these posts don't consider fatigue or multiple hostile parties present in different systems. This can actually get really interesting where you bait the standing fleet response on target A only for your hunting fleet to engage target B 10 jumps away.
---
Like you I think this is going to be a huge boon for hunters more than anyone. You can also use multiple logged off covert cynos to move your fleet without anyone knowing what system you even went to.
---
Sounds more like a cry for help but gfys - not planning on it.
---
Yes a game mechanic that is Ikit vs Ikit and is dead during the TZ I play. Thank you for the suggestion though.

Eve has video? I play it using a text only terminal.

wanna show me on zkill where volta actually fought a fight that was just hunting pve'rs?

I think you really underestimate
---
Eve is such a fish in the ocean game. The bigger fish always eating up the smaller fish and it keeps going up the food chain. Until you are a whale (carrier) the you have a hard time going after the frigates as they are so small and fast that they can swim around or away from you. Also the bigger the school of fish you are in the longer chance of surviving goes up.
---
I found a modern Richard Bartle over here boys
---
I asked a question, if people want to reply and assume, that's on them. I asked OP.
---
Who the fuck is Richard Bartle?
---
The situation will have a regional dependency.  I don't think it'll be any different where the big blocs are, i.e. supers on coms will get saved, sillies not on coms will die, rorqs on coms will get saved, dumbos not on comms will die.  That is more or less as it is now, with local.
---
The one big change will be for carriers and subcaps.  I think ratting in a carrier will be completely out of the question now.  It cannot survive a reasonable-sized drop with enough time to ping standing.  Of course they will be quite nice as bait (pilot won't have zoned out, so that cyno will go up right away and/or the cloaked sabres will warp in, etc.).  Subcaps will be equally vulnerable for more or less the same reason, especially in escalations (of which there will be fewer) but also for the same reason maybe quite nice to use as bait.
---
I think I'm going to buy a Redeemer later on this evening.  Sold my last one years ago.

I like how you tried to do five different accents at once in that vid
---
Bait domi and bot domi are basically the same until you ship scan.
---
Have night mode be the default.
---
Plex vault exists. This is blatant RMT.
---
LoL, you're the ones pisssing and moaning about not being able to rat in complete safety, but I'm the one that's salty? That's fucking rich
---
As someone who led some of those standing fleets you talk about, I doubt it,
---
The combat pilots will get bored without content.  And if there is content; that means the rorqs aren’t out making money.
---
Either way, the lack of intel makes it a lot harder to hold a standing fleet up.
---
They were fun to fight in FW and now they seem to be dying a slow death since they left lowsec.
---
This is disgusting. They log in, activate hack and jump to their fort before they even materialise. Litteraly. There is just no time to do anything else. Like how is this supposed to be fair. Meanwhile Falcon is parading around saying that we should calm down and that everything is fine.
---
But wardec immunity was going to fix player retention. Just look at how many more people are playing!

I mean.  I haven't played in nearly 3 years and this interests me to resub and get my stratios roams going again.

Sick man cheers for this. that video about vocal fry is a god send cheers man.

The correct action to take is throw all the pve subcaps in the trash, buy a rorqual or a super depending on the flavor of pve you prefer, and finally, join one of the power blocs with a super umbrella, click the cyno button as required. 
---
It's basically business as usual unless you are trying to be an out dated small entity, it's time to adapt and get into the blue donut, or die.

Iceland is a must visit place so I will suggest to plan FanFest + couple of extra days to visit the country, but if you already did it once I wont recommend to pay all the expenses just for FanFest (it is very expensive to stay there and even CCP will charge you for drinks in the party while it is free in Vegas and that shows you how $$$ your trip will be)  and I would recommend Vegas.
---
Also something to keep in mind is that Fanfest and all meetups are about your group so if you you are in an EU based  corp then maybe Fanfest will make sense and still be cheaper but for US based my vote goes to (1 Fanfest + Iceland trip then Vegas every year plus Goons go wild in Vegas)
---
Well yeah, if there's only 1 t1 frig :P
---
But a group of 6 or more T1 frigs can do anything subcap.
---
Apologies my friend will try working on it in future videos
---
How many players are you gonna split your ISK/hour with?
---
Agreed.  When I lived in C5 space, we'd only scan two deep generally if we were looking for a fight.  Then roll it and try again.
---
Made me laugh :) cheers
---
You can remap it to anything.  I think default is "v" so there's already a hotkey you can use.  It's just impossible to miss the spacebar and I'm constantly hitting it...
---
Still beats the hell out of lowsec. I have literally no sympathy at all for any nullseccer crying about shit. I use to belt rat in 2008 for isk and any other activity now beats that even highsec level 4 missions.
---
Cool so others will fight for you, and if they fair poorly they will question why and either give up or force your alliance to log in and fight. Either way the game progresses.
---
I think I only ever lost skills twice.
---
Oh look my post got downvoted... I wonder by whom.
---
I’ve never really looked into FW, are there major player run corps like in null or is it primarily done through the NPC ones? Who are some of the big players if I’m looking to get into it?
---
It's dead Jim.
---
But CCP does have a soundcloud with all that music if you insist in playing this game with sound.
---
Wait hold up did he just say triage carrier? 2015 wants its slowcats back.
---
If you want to write purposefully ambiguous comments and bait reactions by playing dumb thats up to you ;)
---
There's gonna be silence anyways.
---
Then screaming.
---
Then looting.
---
That's content to me, lads. 8)
---
It will however make scouting very important, more skill demanding, and blob fights will actually have meaningful counter-intelligence tactics other than "move into dread cache and stay logged off". Covert cynos are going to be stealthy AF and regular cynos can now be used to sow doubt, as you know it's there but you do t know if it is a JF or a super fleet.
---
So many of our tactics are based on local we don't even notice anymore. It will have a big impact that is hard to predict but I'm confident it will be a net positive.
---
Richard A. Bartle! Co-Writer of one the very first Multi User Dungeons, the original text-only-based MMORPGS of yesteryear. He's written a number of college-level texts all about the design of and motivations behind player interaction within a virtual world.

You may have heard of "Bartles Taxonomy of Players", if you did know the name I'm willing to bet you might've taken the Bartle's Taxonomy classification test before without knowing it.

Take a read! He's a fine chap.
---
Gotta get a HIC on it first without the ability to bait and bridge onto him, then gotta get the dreads gated in themselves without getting tackled on gate, and gotta do it all without the super or his alt noticing you in nearby locals.  A super in a lowsec without cynos is pretty safe if he's careful.
---
Can you rephrase that in English please?
---
Uhm, there have been plenty of people saying that in the past when it came to cloaky campers and such. The whole discussion is not exactly new.
---
 Your Corp should j have a market and  the basic of basic should be available there. I don’t like jumping myself so I have a shopping list onhand and wait for wh to trade hubs to pop up then I bring in the cruisers and BS loaded with stuff I need like drones, ammo, scanning equipment, ect. If you go through a lot of ships then get your doctrine ships bp and then you’ll always have a supply on hand. Just know what you can buy and what you will probably only get at jita (bp,Rigs, skillbooks,ect).

What happened to FEDUP jesus christ seems like any taste of Spodumain just instantly infantilizes you.

So CCP screwed-up, again?

&gt; We're defining a "deep safe" for these purposes as any bookmark which is more than 10AU further from the local star than the furthest-out celestial object (planets or stargates).

&gt; * You will no longer be able to create bookmarks outside this range

&gt; * You will no longer be able to issue a "warp to" command to any location outside this range

I mean, fighting on one screen (or client for the single-monitor nerds) doesn't mean you can't be mining on the other. Given the fact that you would know there is an active Standing Fleet and the ~5 minutes of "lemme ping da squad" you get from PANIC, I don't see why the Rorqs can't be out.
---
Standing fleets with poor intel, i.e free kills
---
like pineapple on pizza bb

Nah it’s what I have been told since day 1. Guess it’s wrong. Either way off dscan safes shouldn’t exist
---
While the Uni has an Incursion group, we mostly stick to Vanguards since that's what we have numbers for. It's also ordinarily open only to current and former Uni members and their alts, so it's not a public group and probably not useful for OP because of that. For HQs, people in the Uni with Incursion alts run with TDF or WTM mentioned above.
---
you bastard
---
You vastly overestimate the number of alliances that actually have a FAX that can respond in less than two minutes.
---
The ".boom" got me.  Well done.

And it’s not camped or filled with suicide gankers that dominate Jita!
---
Yuck move on man. I've been there many times. Nobody's coming back man. Go enjoy the game.
---
It has nothing to do with bots, why that narrative is around? The uneducated think it's affecting the in game economy, and CCP uses it to push thier agenda on the players. It has everything to do with making it harder and harder to make the in game currency, and more likely that you will lose ships. All a tactic to drive micro transaction sales of PLEX, which are sold for in game currency.

&gt; We'll see. I think a small group of people will be happy about it (the hunters) while it actively hurts the larger population, prices of basically ev
---
It will take time to adapt to the new situation but the hunted (barring existing bots) will be OK. I actively PVP for less than half of my game time, so I'm closer being one of the prey than the hunters.
---
People always talk about retention. The truth is we don't know enough (we being the players) about why the average person leaves. It might just be as simple as boredom or new shiny games. I've been here over a decade and I'd say that the player count has declined as the game was made easier. I can't make hard conclusions from my experience, though and maybe the promise of ambulation was driving subscriptions until it was done away with. -shrug-
---
What I mean by all that is this change might shake things in a good or bad way. I doubt it will have much impact on retention, not counting the bots. All I know for sure is I'll ragequit once in a while but I'll end up coming back until a competitor to the once hardcore Eve is online. I wouldn't even look back if I found an apocrypha-like game with no safety nets.
---
I hate to tell you this but bait vni/ishtars are most definitely a thing in Delve.
---
&gt; The move script will locate all items (physical objects including ships, cans and structures - anything you can collide with is an item) and bookmarks that are more than 20AU further from the sun than the furthest celestial. It will then move them towards the sun until they are exactly on the 20AU boundary for that system.

Flair bait. look up his character on zkill if you don't believe me.
---
Fear man; that’s a big part of it.  Big blocs like to get into fights they know they will win.  If they don’t have all the information, and this local thing limits it a lot more than people realize, then there will be more hesitation to drop trillions of isk.
---
Not every time of course, but it only takes a few kills for blood in the water and that’s content.  A little content goes a long way.
---
Yo, ccp, my bots died even though they should have docked up when someone entered local.  Demanding reimbursement or I'll cancel my 984209832408972340983240234 accounts.

This is late but there's a lot you can do on a larger scale if people can't get a good idea about your numbers.  Maybe people will take riskier fights if they can't measure everyone else's dick with as much precision as possible now.

Eh, most heavily mined systems already have campers on every gate so not they know more about who just came into system.
---
What does the killboard has to do with enjoying a PVP rich enviorment? You can paint it red and still have a great time shooting other people instead of krabbing just for the sake of it.
---
&gt; also huggin needs a PG buff, ccplz
---
For the love of god, this.
---
my point stands, i cant find any kills of volta fighting a small gang that wasnt shit.
---
do you just actively run away when people stop undocking feroxs and vni's to fight you?
---
Soooooooooooooooon.....
---
You do realize that anything in the scan inhibitor can't see anything on d-scan right? So not only can the scan inhibitor be probed out easily, but whoever is inside it won't see the probes. 
---
Go ahead and use them. Your location can still be probed out and it's only a 30km radius from the inhibitor you can hide in. That's not a lot of ground that needs to be covered to tackle someone. 
---
Before you get all jumpy about using bubbles, anyone who is scanning in a T3 is going to be nullified. I saw some people suggesting using bubbles inside scan inhibitors to create a trap. Not gonna work if they are in a nullified T3.
---
Fear; the unknown.  Right now a few well placed alts can monitor an entire system for enemies.  They see you coming from miles away.
---
There aren’t enough alts in all of nullsec to cover the intel we had before.  Shit I remember alts that were undetectable bots.  All they did was sit in a system and the bot looked at local and pinged whenever the screen changed.
---
One unmanned bot could see an entire system.  Now you’d need one for each gate, and it would be extremely costly.
---
it wouldnt matter, but to insult someone (nullbear) you gotta have something to back it up

You are not entitled to a specific income in EVE.

Not that I know of, and I don't see why would that be the case either.

Since when? Are you new to this subreddit or something?

Fuck, my days off this week were today and Thurs.

Blue loot is sold to NPC buy orders. It's nothing but a faucet in the same way bounties are. They are generated when you kill a sleeper then sold straight to an NPC that pulls ISK out of their butt to hand to our intrepid capsuleer. Only the salvage gets used by players in T3 production.
---
Ok, obviously it went way above your head. My point was to stop bitching and bring more people. Is that simple enough language?
---
so instead of not finding any pvers on my killboard you shift to "hurr wasnt shit durr". i get it, volta is like that jock that stole your girl in HS and youre still mad about it years later. bitter.
---
Agreed on regional dependency. The big blocs are going to be the larger target at first until people realize removing local isn't going to make them any better at hunting. I just don't think we are going to see the impact people are screaming about on ratters. Major fleet fights? Eh maybe. People will adapt. I think you are spot on about subcaps and carriers being the most at risk.
---
Been to both and o have to say if you can afford it go to Fanfest. It’s bigger and better in every sense. Plus Iceland is a great place to visit. I would have never thought of visiting if it weren’t for EvE. Left impressed. Yes it’s expensive but doing it once doesn’t hurt. Vegas still had good content. But it’s like going to Dodixie vs Jita to get what you need. Broke the bank but I didn’t regret it.
---
Even if everyone turtles up, hundreds of hunting gangs will cross paths and kill each other. It's going to be FUN, something nullsec has lacked for a while.
---
The logs will show nothing; they were blacked out as well.
---
since never, but if you dont I just see you as a random pubbie cheering on other people while trapped in jita 4-4

So much about this sentence is fucking hilarious, and honestly, he was being polite when he simply said "makes you look like a moron".

Wrong, your client is aware of every ship inside the system. You don't go to server in order to check who is inside dscan cone

Why would you cheat in a game that has no goals, who were you impressing . Was it pressure from your corp leadership or just a desire to see those fat iks’s. Honestly I don’t get it .  Was it a desire to get into endgame titan pvp stuck in tiedi for hours hearing people eat chicken wings and screaming at you? I am just confused. 
---
Hope you find a better game this time there are plenty of them in this one.

Since I usually fly Gallente, I set F1 to be drone attack and moved the rest of the F keys over one spot.  Then I did recall and orbit on F11 and recall to bay of F12

AFAIK the furry corp kicked itself via dramacascade.

Good on you for finding the fun in it. Don't let the bittervets get you down

i havent shifted, it was always my thought

are you having trouble finding me a fight against another competent small gang?

or is the ~elite pvp~ scene content with farming vnis and idiots who run at you solo?

Even if you don't want to participate in the militia, the plex krabs semi-AFKing in T1 frigates make good killboard padding if you pounce on em fast enough.

There absolutely will be people who die in supers, explaining that local was empty when they undocked, they don't understand what happened, they weren't on comms, and whichever coalitions own these people had better get on reddit and tell the story.

It'll actually be pretty amusing to see how many "elite PVPers" quit when there are no seals left to club, and the only thing in space are people that put up a fight or umbrella-backed supers.
---
I remapped Directional Scan from V to Spacebar.
---
Yeah, I wasn't thinking of a pop-up (fuck that), but something in your dscan window (contact at "210*") or a visual representation on the system map. No distance either.

I definitely like the idea of focusing the dscan to eke out some range, that would be nifty

Maybe I'm a scrubnoob but this is the first time I've seen a text post with a video embedded in it.

It could actually fit the systems I've done the bms. If the system has a radius of 40 au then 60 au out is still possible
---
Sure mah dude, everyone's welcome!
---
Don't forget dotlan too, and the other services
---
i need a lokitoki appearance tho. is he active?
---
That's the essence of it. CCP has rewarded risk-averse behavior for so long, it'll be hard for people to realize that swinging their dick around *might actually mean* getting fragged.
---
Granted I do like some of the farther-reaching implications of this change. Things can go south really quick if a dread ball isn't scouted and you decide to swing your dick on a cruiser gang and drop a few supers.
---
All your alpha accounts? Yes please. Bots don't go omega.
---
Nope.
---
There also eve onion but they heavily exaggerate everything.
---
If nullsec is bored and miserable is because nullsecers huddle up under cap umbrellas, or blue anyone who could pose a threat.
---
Yeah I saw that...
---
&gt;As for this idea I think that CCP should actively avoid any new implementations that would make hunting and pvp more difficult.
---
I agree. Honestly, it occurred to me as a way of giving away your own position by excessive scanning, as a way of encouraging content... So a paranoid ratter pinging away at his d-scan would light himself up on hunter's screens. Likewise, an overzealous hunter could broadcast his presence if he's not too sharp. Or you could skip the active d-scan, and listen for pings while checking anoms manually, keep that stealth factor going
---
okay thank you i'll try that too
---
(also I had a adaptive invenerability shield (even with it it was tough) so I went and got a energized kinetic membrane? something like that it had 33% kinetic deflection and the kinetic deflection shield 1 had 25% deflection (but mine also has the same and protects from more types of damage so it is somewhat better) kinetic deflection shield 2 had 50% but costs 2 mil I only had 10 mils so that a lot anyway I got the membrane and returned back to the site but on my way got killed by a trig drone (I was afk)

The bookmarks were from some time around 2014-2015, I can't recall exactly when, but well after the "Tyrannis deep safe nerf". Not sure how they were created, but I was doing some blops-ing with my old corp and we got covert cyno'd into some crazy remote deep safes. So I bookmarked 'em and they worked. I suspect maybe the safe spot was close enough to a nearby star system as to be considered within the acceptable range? I have no clue on how they were made and the dude who got us there was hush-hush about it when I asked.
---
Also, I've seen other deep safes of this kind as recent as 2018, from a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9d35th/i_found_over_28b_of_ships_hidden_far_away_in_a/) where some guy found a ton of ships chilling out ~180 AU away in a deep safe inside a C6 wormhole system.
---
Don’t know about days/weeks, but you can always tell the new players on roams/hunts, “I’m bored, When are we going to find someone, Let’s go there...” while the vets simply ask, “What are you watching”
---
At the start? Yes.
---
But once you get used to it it gets pretty normal, with all the automation cheating is much easier than playing normally. But I get you point.
---
It's not bait. It's an inaugural killmail.

huh okay

I had 125mm to 150 mm railguns (both scout and normal rails)

does that change something?

So, awful?

no idea if it got fixed, but there was a bug where the launcher would close the ui, but not the process. then when you started the launcher again and because it was a duplicate process it wouldn't have any account information. if you then killed both processes from task manager and opened the launcher it would have all your accounts again.

might be worth checking task manager for duplicate instances of the launcher process.

as i said, you have zero pint to make, just a bitter dude on a random internet forum, its not a problem. just alot of bitter. and if you see my KB i have alot of losses and kills and hardly ANY vnis, with plenty of small gang.
---
This has probably been said before me but isn't the whole god damm game about risk ? Who gives a crap, put on those big gal panties and roll. Either man up or woman up, hell even plex up.
---
Sound like passive sonar from cold waters or any other sub hunt game. It interesting but I'm not sure the game could handle several thousand of players doing that at once.
---
Frankly the intro missions should heavily push new players toward a revamped FW.
---
DHSJ  proteus
---
Again, not what I said. I'm merely pointing out that each and every one of the said hallmark behaviors exhibited by bots are also exhibited by, get this, every fucking real person who is ratting and paying attention.
---
Are you the Russian that got my warthunder account banned
---
Most of my gameplay was non-human, mainly automated using macros.
---
I used quite a bit of exploits to progress in the game as well.. I used multiple accounts that helped eachother..
---
As for isk, I did earn it without being at my machine, I just let the PC run and the scripts would do the work for me.
---
You don't say.....
---
Not trying to troll or hassle you, but genuinely curious what you’ve been doing in game for the last four years.
---
Except they are exactly the same ship because the AFK ratting Domi fit has a cyno (for umbrella) and a warp disruptor (the warp disruptor is used to guarantee aggro on the rats before launching drones). So good luck trying to determine the difference. Plus you have to decloak to get a ship scan so...
---
Talking in Stations is my main news source.

---
oof
---
I didn't use or need aimware for this game the way it is constructed, nor is there any for it to begin with.
---
But I understand the sarcasm.
---
In your opinion with being a cheater what would be the easiest way to find someone else cheating?
---
I’ll have to check it out, thanks for the link dude legit had never heard of him!
---
I like it. It gives me peace of mind with nothing on scan changes.
---
Its okay I resubbed a lot of my accounts so CCP is ISK positive
---
I don't have any hacking skills, I just paid the modders some money and they did the work for me.. I am just a consumer.
---
"Nest target, last target". Basically left and right on targeting.
---
that is actually very good (thinking about getting some mods to decrease shield recharge time) however the 4/10 escalation (scout outpost) had over a dozen kinetic missle ships so they just peppered me with those so while very good i'm not sure about just sitting in one place and waiting for my drones to kill them one by one while I get peppered (I've never checked out drones so not sure how quick they'll kill NPCs frigate but i'll see, it's boosts to drone damage are very appealing)
---
Just like any other game, I wanted to unlock goods. But it was just too slow/expensive, so I got into automation.
---
PVP is not very interesting as it is not as rewarding as other games.
---
This is exactly why I'm not terribly interested in null sec at all. Me and my group of friends stick to dirty low sec pvp and pirating because its much quicker and more technical.
---
The whole "F1 Lineman" life is fun to try and experience once or twice.
---
I think its almost entirely unanimously agreed that sub 50ish player fights are way more engaging and interesting for everyone involved.
---
oh ya EVE onion too, but don't really consider them a \*news\* website
---
the best that could ever happen for the game.
---
But finally I can log off in a krab system and no one will know!
---
Got it
---
huh didn't even know that existed until now hmm not sure but i'll think about it ,it seems good for modern day EVE
---
oh ya TIS is great, but looking for more article based stuff since I can wear headphones at work.
---
Nothing like this game out there. Don’t be intimidated. Grab a couple of accounts and start training. There are a lot of outlets out there for newbies.
---
I found stuff regarding that issue but as far as I checked there wasn't any duplicate process :&lt;
---
Thanks for the tip though!
---
Apologies about the delay u/LeavingaLegacy1 . Between EVE North where I was doing a live news update and then the 4th in the states, kinda have had our hands full. Its only been about two weeks since we did something (which was at EVE North and can be found on the CCP Twitch Channel, eventually the YouTube channel). I am going to have a 1900 out this week, promise. :)
---
With a large murder Bonner
---
Also a noob, but I use it for doing security missions, and just generally flying around and looking badass. It's helpful to fit small turrets against smaller targets for lower level missions, even though the ship supports medium.
---
They said blackout not black people. Jesus.
---
That’s ctrl-space. You can remap Dscan to space without interfering with that.
---
I forgot about this bit, that'll be interesting.
---
Either they hop out of the game, move to high sec, or start setting up automated scouts at each dockable station or stargate and go to dead ends or chokepoints.
---
But it looks cool!
---
Seriously, is there a cruiser that you would recommend, besides the Vexor? I'd like something that doesn't use drones.
---
They’re a thing everywhere. It still doesn’t make subcao ratting viable
---
That sounds exploitable if the client is also aware of their exact location.
---
Im fairness to CCP, it is easier to get into the game than it was when I joined back in 2010. Theyve got to be careful how they tweak things though. They cpuld definitely be doing a better job but rhey xpuld be doing so much worse. As devs go, I actually think they are pretty good. I knlw that'll be unpopular here but anyone whos played Ark will know just how bad things can get.
---
I approve!
---
good meme
---
It's a skin.
---
Tvp is active and make way more isk per hour than wtm
---
That's awesome news, can't wait to read it! Yeah no worries mate real life comes first, I'm just jonesing for a fix haha.
---
What exactly are you trying to do with it?
---
It's free to try.
---
Oh god lol
---
just to roleplay my flair for a minute, what is this "gate" you speak of? ;) 
---
I can totally see how this (like anything in eve) will be abused by crafty players, but that after all, is the essence of this sadistic sandbox. So, to your point directly, yes I fly alone, yes I lose 90% of the time, and yes, it's fun to me, coz that 10% is pure gold &lt;3
---
You didn't learn from the bots, the bot programmers programmed the bots to look exactly like a human. *They* learned from you.
---
I'll have you know that some of my bestfriends are blackout.
---
I feel like the little wing part should be the sensor array that sticks out for scanning and not just some random ass wing. But it looks nice other than that.
---
Cheers man :)
---
Alot of people will drop on t1 cruiser for salt farming... Fuel cost aint shit. 
---
First time I got dropped was in Black Rise by local pirates on the Innia gate in Eha... I will never forget that. Baited on an easy Gnosis kill. 
---
I laughed so much and thanked them for having big man balls. 
---
The other side is most cap pilots are too risk adverse. "I gotta have 4 faxes on stand by to drop a carrier".  Don't bling em and they are cheaper than a decently fit t3c after insurance.  Hot drop o'clock!
---
What big fights did you help BL gain advantages in via your exploits/escapades.
---
Lol people absolutely prefer groups that will fight back with similar numbers. Do you unironically believe that small gangs prefer shooting vnis over fighting similar/slightly larger small gangs?
---
Damn good ending of a damn good series. Thanks for reminding me about this series.
---
...
---
Great! Now I'm gonna have to see the whole thing again!
---
If I don't hear it, I get scared
---
Those were mainly in Python.
---
This false flag thread brought to you by roaming pvp - If you can't shoot non-pvp ships, lure new pvp players into your killzone.
---
Was elo aware that you were helping him via 1337 hax?
---
Ratting in a super will be THE safest option for krabbing in Delve/Esoteria/wherever else with a proper umbrella. Properly tanked, you will survive until FAX land and a super is far harder to hold down or irritate for content than a carrier for a small gang, while also spitting out too much DPS for resurgent BLOPS BS/T3cs to be a serious threat.  
---
Rorquals will still be decent but you will need to watch those excavs like a hawk. 
---
Subcap ratting is gonna take a big drop.
---
It's part of their bot detection/removal script.
---
&gt; Either way off dscan safes shouldn’t exist
---
100 AU radius systems wanted me to pass a message along to you:
---
What the fuck bro?
---
Yes please, i'll takt two of these.
---
To be fair, I bet you could hit warp before they land if you initiated when you saw them at 14.7 AU
---
Keep the tractor bonus, but allow Maraudet tractor to work on ships, with effectiveness drop off based on mass.
---
Imagine sitting there in bastion and literally *pulling* orbiting frigates and cruisers into scram/grapple range. They should be able to burn out if they go opposite of the beam, but that will also lower transversal. 
---
Both thematic and pretty unique.
---
The current imicus screams 'Kill me'.
---
Didn't know that, I usually solve that by rebooting whole computer. Thanks for the info!
---
Who else remembers EVE Tribune?
---
So they only kill rorqual drones because they fight back?
---
Same could be said about hunters, they don't want good fights they want shiny kill mails.
---
If you're going to put this much effort into a video, at least get someone to proofread your text
---
Just think of this is the response it would be perfect bait to start a big fight and get the enemy to commit expensive shit.
---
1337 is a language,
---
Old pvpers work aswell to be honest vOv
---
Did you read all of the definitions for smelt? The third is as follows:
---
a simple past tense and pastparticiple of smell.
---
The new nullsec play style that people seem to think is good design, press v every 2 seconds for the entire time you want to pve.
---
&gt; INN pumps out content, but I’m pretty sure North Korea has a higher ‘fair and balanced’ reporting standard than they do
---
That sounds pretty dumb, they have writers from all over eve and the traffic seems to be a lot more important than some goofy agenda you've dreamed up. I'm not buying the fake news bit you're pushing
---
I will be doing it for the month and seeing how things go.
---
So this is an ask you questions, and receive non-responses session.
---
I used to say that eve was the best spectator sport in video gaming. Then I started playing it. I still say that though. \^\^
---
This is not RMT. Check the zkill of the gankers , that\`s what they do ... pop ships at Jita 44 dock. And those chars did it for like 4-5 years now.
---
Doesn't play Eve.
---
Gives out advice on how to play lol.
---
\*laughs in combat recon\*
---
&gt; I'm not sure the game could handle several thousand of players doing that at once.
---
This is my biggest concern about the blackout. I wonder if the servers will fold when 10,000+ players start spamming dscan repeatedly.
---
I tried doing some fw lately with one of my alts and just seem to get blobbed my alt can fly most ships but I thought I will use t1 frigs and destroyers and all I see are t2 frigs the odd faction frig and t2/3 destroyers
---
I like to hear the bong while im hitting bongs
---
i laughed a lot with this! HAHA
---
No, nobody RMT's by coin flipping what they're selling to get half the value. This doesn't happen with any regularity and is not a good business model. You should not need an adult to explain this to you.
---
Take your car payment and flip a coin - when thousands of transactions in economy based games happen every day. You're thinking there's someone checking shipping containers as if there were unlimited manpower.
---
It's not their best design, but it's better than the turd we have now.
---
Jesus how long would you be in warp in that last bookmark from the sun in a frigate?
---
Schweig, schuft.
---
Not pineapple pizza is a dish made by the gods. Even chossuh said so.
---
it still looks like a turd, just with a bit of polish.
---
I am actually resubbing for just this weekend then going inactive again
---
Leaving Australia myself to live in Europe for a few months, the only thing i think about is not the different food, the different cultures or anything. I cannot wait to get my hands on Eve and see how different EU connexion is.   
---
One more month. One more month. ONE MORE MONTH AAAAAAAH
---
Jin'taan has been producing some pretty neat videos of late.
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcF6-wAlyiRLXW57_x9YwJQ
---
&gt;The only reason to be out there is if you have a carrier
---
Don't make statements when you don't actually know.  Had me until you said this.
---
And here my dumbass thought you could only activate them in such systems
---
change all modules from F1, F2 etc to just 1, 2, etc
---
You YouTube link was deleted. Guess mods dont like you showing people.
---
I quite literally fell asleep during one of the fleets I was a part of.
---
Yeah you can slap combats on a hecate and just chill in a ratting pocket and see what u find.
---
Is...is this bait?
---
Ccp, because fuck you!
---
Just start one so you can wardec people in highsec.  Or join a corp that does that for you haha.
---
Thank you so much i thought my PC was dying, glad to hear it's not just me !! Since the June update, i feel like there is some kind of graphic memory leak (if that can even exist), FPS starts ok but the more i play, the worse it gets, to the point where it's litteraly unplayable (less than 10fps).
---
Tried everything, changing graphic settings, minimizing client for a while to help my GC, going fullscreen mode, nothing works. The only way is just to reboot client 10 times a day...
---
I see your point, but Near2 simply reads a chat log and bleeps if its however many jumps away from you. I think it has a buggy feature that checks killmails but these are all things someone can do without Near2. Realistically if you are tabbed out of EVE on a single monitor with a Rorqual for longer than a couple of minutes you're going to lose excavators so if you're on comms and have intel open you can do the same thing yourself.
---
No local is going to make it harder but intel channels will just be used differently, the guy above you suggesting one guy who made a computer program has destroyed EVE seems to not understand how easy it is to do this stuff by yourself
---
you're overestimating what is needed for a response. a few fax is usually all that's needed, maybe a super or two to kill shit. anything they can't handle is going to stick around long enough to log in and jump in titans
---
How much null-bloc player time has been "wasted" by defending against Drifters?
---
Combat probing....
---
Thank you so much :D
---
I will add it to my list. Finding 100hrs to make one from scratch isn't easy!
---
Yeah pretty much every top comment is to join a newbro corp.
---
I think that's a good idea for people who don't want to PvP.  You can rat with at least SOME protection -- but for people who want to actually learn PvP aren't going to learn much pressing F1 in a fleet.
---
I didn't really start learning this game until I went to lowsec and started to learn about the turrets, ammo, and ships.  And recently I created a google doc with all of this information PLUS a log of all my fights with notes.  Before doing that I would just see a ship and yolo into it because I didn't know it's engagement profile.  Now I still YOLO in because I can still learn stuff but I know if I have a chance or not before jumping in.
---
Wormholers are such toxic asshats.  Definitely will not miss you.
---
Thank you!
---
Uh huh sure you did
---
Come on, it's not gonna be that bad right?
---
Then you have alt alliances of like 1-5 toons taking region sov while the parent alliance lives in the owned systems. It's easily gamed.
---
+ why's it exist then? 
---
My take someone is undocking in a ship that will never die, then do to pilot error there is no insta-undock bookmark and the guy gets locked. Look at the km, kids are just blapping whatever undocks that makes a piloting error, happens 24/7 on jita undock.
---
Why is the plex not in a plex vault? Lack of game knowledge most likely, you had to carry plex like this the majority of EVE's existence. Plex Vault is brand spanking new in the timeline of EVE. Ship is never expected to die or get caught - this is pilot error and general lack of knowledge.
---
As an Amarr, I freakin missed Schneckt when they left
---
Mid slots to 1 2 3 4 5 and all overheat to Maj+key (Maj+F1, Maj+1) etc.
---
My launcher started doing this and I'm guessing it's a new, slightly improved handling of client/launcher software updates.
---
Only during the day 
---

---
Join Pandemic Horde and wait for Blitzkrieg fleets.
---
At least the loot fairy said no.
---
And the snake continues to eat its tail.
---
Smiles while undocking in a Lachesis...
---
Not good, not terrible ...
---
except for daytrippers, they almost never d-scan
---
Roughly 500,000,000 / 3600 hours if you fly my travel cyno fit. Could cut to 100,000,000 / 3600 hours with some investments probably.
---
If cost is a consideration. Factor where you are traveling from and your currency exchange rate. Iceland can be a tad expensive for someone like me from the southern US who completely sucks at being frugal. If you do your homework and plan ahead, you can make an Iceland trip fit a modest budget. I completely ignored that advice and did not want to restrict myself on my first trip to Iceland and home to my favorite game.
---
I love food and alcohol when I travel. I wanted to experience as much local cuisine and breweries/distillers as I could. On average I spent $50-$75 USD for two per meal. We got an Air BNB so were able to modestly save  on meals by supplementing with leftovers and stock from the local grocers. Alcohol was my biggest expense during the trip; outside of airfare, lodging and rental car. The duty free shop is your friend here, so stock up before leaving the airport. I enjoy Snus which is an oral pouch tobacco and illegal in Iceland. I was able to manage with making my own using loose tobacco and rolling papers which can be bought at the Duty Free shop  or locally at a moderate expense.
---
Not knowing where you are from and what effort is required for you to get to either location. Fanfest in Iceland is a must, at least once. CCP provides plenty of diversions relating to Eve and Iceland alone to fill your time. During Fanfest 2018 I struggled to attend all of the event sessions during the day. There was so much content. The extra curricular activities like the Pub Crawl, Charity Dinner and Permaband/Basshunter (or other guest band/DJ) concert are worth it if you can afford it. But as others have mentioned, if it fits your budget, give yourself a few extra days to explore. If you bring a significant other who is not as rabid about Eve like me, spring for the Sisters of Eve tours for them. I want to go again so I can skip the parts of Fanfest that overlap and go on the tours myself. 
---
While language was a minor barrier for us when we went deep into Iceland, the people are great. Most spoke English and are forgiving of any cultural misunderstandings. It was 80%/20% (positive/negative) in most cases for me, some Icelandic folk were prepared to handle us while others were less tolerant of our lack of experience. We did as much homework on Iceland as we could in preparation for the trip. Being prepared bridged some of those gaps in cultural differences.
---
While we had an AWD rental car for our excursions, we stayed very close to the Harpa. We walked to just about everywhere in downtown Reykjavik with little effort. IT was more economical to swap our cellular phone SIM cards with the local carriers in Iceland. Cellular performance was perfect and coverage was good even during our excursions trips. Do your homework on coverage in the areas you intend to visit just to be safe. 
---
A couple of other notable mentions. Public laundry was limited so if your lodging doesn't offer it plan to pack plenty of extra clothes based on your intended activities and stay. I am a water snob and the tap water was superb. The hot water is fed from local geothermal reservoirs/springs. It comes into some establishments untreated and retains its "sulfury" odor and is very hot. I never overcame the smell and struggled with it when cleaning dishes and daily showers. Other facilities will filter the hot water so you may never encounter this. Leave spare room in your luggage for the return trip home for swag. Attendance to Fanfest provided us with great memorabilia as well as finding awesome keepsakes during our adventures. (I had to have a handcrafted locally sourced wool sweater and tuque before returning home.)
---
Okay, so this sounds more like a promotional post for the Icelandic Travel Administration. But I hope it helps in your decision.
---
While i don't like that idea, nor the idea of increasing the range (at least by a lot) I do wish they would make the dscan range a nice number. either knocking it down to 14 au or up to 15 au would be fine.
---
Mid and lowslots on 1-8
---
I mean, I can press F1 whilst clicking on screen. Not that hard to do.
---
If it were true and he was right i'm sure we wold be rife with hacks that told you exactly where people were.
---
They plan to change that soon with Observatories. They will add the option, but you will have to pay for it and the will be in game ways to disrupt them. But the current all-knowing magic local chat makes no sense in null.
---
&gt; t's days and weeks of utter boredom interspersed with literal minutes of abject terror.
---
Have you considered leaving Pandemic Horde for a new home?
---
When did I ever say I wanted to rat in safety? Now you are just making things up to fuel your salty narrative to yourself.
---
Wardec? War declare? Super noob here man bear with me.
---
It's called eyes as alts ahead of the system. Gives you a few more minutes while you guess at which scan inhib to go after.
---
You mean like hisec industrialists who press V every 2 seconds to look for gank ships?
---
Strange, it's almost as if nullsec is becoming less secure and more dangerous than highsec!
---
With the local changes I just won't fucking undock. You can't make me, and there's no incentive to fight you, and I don't owe you fun. Speaking of fun, have fun shooting my citadel's or sov wanding lmbo. Ill wait until final timer with my coalition. Then we'll see whose tough.
---
I don't play this game to be content for elite pvpers. I'm just going to wait out the changes as long as I can and so is the rest of my alliance.
---
When I need to Plex again I'll just quit until CCP reverses this idiotic and unthought out change. I think a lot of customers like me feel the same. We're the majority too real.smart CCP
---
I mostly just watch Netflix or play PoE while playing this stupid game so no real change from my end. I'll enjoy listening to the elite pvpers cry as they realize nobodies actually ratting lmao!
---
Gg idiots getting hyped .
---
I love that idea. While they're doing that they can make the UI more...Uable with the new dscan powers.
---
There is a pretty small subset of people that actually try to do nothing but kill excavators and most of them are heavily multiboxing. People roaming looking for pvp don't go out roaming to kill nothing but excavators, they will however try if it's the only thing the defenders are willing to undock besides caps. It sounds like you haven't actually roamed much. Most null regions consist of groups that rorq mine/dock when roamers show up and refuse to fight small groups unless they start toasting sov or tackle rorqs. Even then it's generally difficult to hold rorqs down with a small group considering they can do a shitload of drone DPS while being near impossible to defang/kill in any reasonable amount of time. When many of these null regions are willing to fight back it's almost always with either overwhelming capital force or by spending half an hour forming a 50 man ferox gang to stop the tyranny of like 4 nano cruisers and a ceptor.
---
Now, you might be someone that looks past the entire spaceship thing and views the whole game paradigm as an irrelevant meta in a greater struggle of skill between people behind screens across the planet. But for a lot of people the spaceship thing is quite a major thing and the fact we have spaceships which such an obvious design flaw is simply stupid.
---
But seeing as you asked, I am not really sure that setting dscan to 360 and 14au and spamming a key every few seconds really constitutes any kind of skill or adds a particularly interesting mechanic to the game.  (Aggressive dscan use is skill of course, but that’s a totally different story).
---
Will this result in more fun? I am not convinced, there will be a few weeks while the particularly stupid will lose big ships, (just like goons lost krab capitals even when they were told their umbrella was away on business), but big stuff will eventually fit cynos and a bit more tank, there will be lots of crying about cyno Inhibs, people in umbrellas will drop when people need them, (at leat until Get gets really boring acting as space policemen).A new disposable ratting meta will evolve for the subcap people.  Overall people will find new ways to make isk,
---
I roam in ~1b ships. That's quite a lot of ticks if you kill me.
---
I am the maniac.
---
You need a hug.
---
\*wipes mouth\*
---
That was salty AND refreshing.
---
YYYUUUUMMMMM
---
Just for that I want the D-scan bong to now be a three-tone signal that is as obnoxious as possible.
---
Most people: WH space is scary, almost like a hardcore mode of EVE.
---
CCP: You’ll take it and you’ll like it.
---
The issue is the size. At some point it becomes new member unfriendly because to "try more" means you've got thousands upon thousands of people in front of you, more established in the alliance, with preferential treatment and access.
---
given how long it would probably take to find you, and what i actually get from a kill - even if your ship costs 1b to assemble, probably still isn't actually worth my time.
---
&gt; This doesn't happen with any regularity and is not a good business model. You should not need an adult to explain this to you.
---
I’m aware and am looking for an answer addressing something that doesn’t make sense.
---
It’s a shame that you do need an adult to explain to you that if someone’s stupid enough to carry 25,000 plex in a ship then there are likely people stupid enough to try some shitty dice roll to get plex transferred.
---
Turns out I was that adult for you.
---
Do it, you won’t.
---
considering the top 3 posts on the sub right now are about the blackout - i think we know.
---
Gotem
---
I mean if you want to pay 30 mil a pop for a deployable that lasts an hour, go right ahead. Even if you only use 3, that's almost 100 mil an hour so you can try to be somewhat safer when you rat? 
---
Are you even thinking these things out, or are you just trying to come up with a counter, no matter how implausible, to try to "win" the debate?
---
You misspelled gambling
---
buy high sell low
---
Have fun everyone!
---
Having your hand anywhere near f1 prevents fast access to the majority of quickly accessed and effective hotkeys. This is a meme right?
---
Im resubbing.
---
Wormholes. All my friends that I've gotten to actually stay in EVE longer than a couple weeks have joined me in wormhole space.
---
You can get into it with a two day old character. It's almost a crime how neglected this part of the game is. 
---
The game pushes people into missions which probably make people quit more than anything else in this whole game. I've tried almost everything in this game, including null sec and it's awful. The only reason to be out there is if you have a carrier. There are no challenging fights it's all structure bashing or crushing the enemy with no question about who's going to win.
---
The real fun in this game is wormholes, but fortunately it’s the most neglected part of this game.
---
Of course I am. Deflect much?
---
RMT is the only reason to undock with that much plex in your cargo hold.
---
Guarantee day 1 those dudes are going to be completely oblivious.
---
I hope so cuz I always loved FEDUP...anyway black rise is sucks atm so nullbear can be even better tbh
---
sad
---
Yeah.  Just means you can kill people without losing security status.  Normally if you kill someone, you lose security status with whatever faction owns that area and low enough sec status you will be shot at by concord when you go to highsec.
---
However, humans are lazy and make mistakes from time to time and thats how they die. 
---
Bots are always vigilant and wont accidentally miss a threat in local.

---
No way man, you would just be able to find out who was around you by getting the data out of the file it's stored in. It has to hit the server first or it's exploitable.
---
What if the blackout lasts longer than that? CCP said "48 hours notice" not '48 hours duration'.
---
Yeah I think I'll just err on the side of pessimism and keep my stock. Eve player at heart.
---
eh V excuse me V what are you V talking about? V
---
I haven’t been playing for all 4 years, I played for about a year and I mostly ran missions. I would rarely look for a fight, then I joined signal cartel and just explored. After that I took a break for a year and a half and joined back up and immediately joined PL. Hopped on a few fleets but ultimately didn’t want to just listen to an FC. Took another break for some stuff irl and now I’ve been running incursions for a little and just got into a low sec corp.

 esp now that forced 2fa is a thing
---
i'd rather get hacked thanks ccp
---
This is a bad practice for wh groups, so I hope null copies it. It makes it too easy to ignore threats because a hunter knows how to copy and paste.
---
That is incorrect. The server checks a number of conditions before sending you location data on any other ship in space, whether it be on D-scan or the overview
---
Not that this is a good idea, what about a module to have an "active" d-can as opposed to a ship's built in "passive" d-scan. Maybe a passive midslot or sensor boosters increase d-scan range?
---
True for a reasonable normal person. But he might be a returning player that did not know about vault or uninformed about docking mechanics (I\`m cloaked in a nulified 2s align ship ... I cant be caught).
---
That's because he is not right. He is completely wrong
---
Have you tried actually reading anything that's published there? The weekly summaries of the "war" in the north were self aggrandizing circlejerks of how awesome the Imperium is. It's not news, it's random idiots vomiting their opinions.
---
Going to take them a few days to get out of their shells
---
Ah, I just assumed the blue stuff was also a part of the production process.
---
Shhhhh
---
Yeah I agree. Thought it would be interesting if groups divided pockets by corps and every corp is given its own tag though. Seems like people don't use wormhole tags as much as they used to though that's just my personal experience.
---
I krab to make money so I can pvp. I would rather have relative safety so I can reliably make said money to pvp. Does this make me a risk averse scum sucking pve whale? No. It makes me human. Not everyone has the infinite resources you seem to have and can buy/make everything through owning noobs. I am part of a nullsec corporation and we help each other, but if none of us krabbed, we'd be broke all the time
---
Thats a great idea!
---
it'll be dropping supers on roaming gangs.
---
not sure how it's going to be particularly different from business as usual, other than waiting less time between drops.
---
I hunt shiny pvp ships quite frequently for profit, and it doesn't take much effort. It's really passive and mostly automated. You're just afraid of taking risks.
---
Never us west tz..
---
i have literally no reason to take risks.

WHY NOT JUST TURN THE SERVERS OF LOLOLOLOLOLO
---
There is the exception of frigate holes, but they're useless and I've never counted them - they also break the C4 rule of 'no direct kspaces'. Otherwise, it's static, incoming (roaming or static) or a roaming kspace
---
This could work with the implementation of delayed local in nullsec...
---
If someone spams dscan say 10 times in less than 2 minutes,he shows up on local.
---
Imagine taking that personally and responding like this guy did. Yikes
---
You underestimate the Krab and their lustful hunt for 'dank ticks' and 'spod'
---
Highsec is that way ----&gt;
---
You do that stuff before undocking, just like hunters have to prepare before they go hunting.
---
I feel like it’s gona be a weekend thing but no longer than a week. I’ll stick around as long as it’s fun and going on and ppl to shoot. I have no interest in eve with all of its intel channels and locals and ppl docking immediately when someone enters local or 4 jumps out.
---
I can tell you exactly what will happen and how it will happen without any risk of The Plan~ being jeopardized. Reddit has unwittingly flexed it's voting potential to put Olmeca Gold onto the CSM. There is a reason Olmeca Gold didn't appear on any Imperium ballots. We couldn't allow for any indication that we actually wanted him on the CSM. Not even to our line members, it had to be you; reddit that put him there...
---
Reddit puts Olmeca on the CSM with the hopes that he will be something other than an embarrassment. The scandals that surface involving gobbins and olmeca will further deincentivise the [/r/eve](https://www.reddit.com/r/eve) crowd from participation in CSM. Reddit voter turnout will see an all time low, paving the way for an even more powerful GoonSwarm voting bloc. This will have ripple effects causing a sharp drop in viable non-bloc candidates and a sharp increase in NPC candidates designed to split up the vote for the benefit of The Imperium. A member of the northern side of this war will change sides and help The Imperium. The unchecked proliferation of un-used citadels will continue to be zealously addressed by the real heroes of EvE Online. The Imperium.
---
All of this will happen and there isn't a damn thing any of you can do about it. Even if a small percentage of you are self aware enough to accept what is happening, it's already too late. The election is over and no amount of information control will halt the downfall of reddit voter turnout.
---
The past 3 years I have canvased here knowing full well that you would never willingly accept The Key~ to your shackles even if presented to you. The ultimate argument inoculation, the ultimate dead agenting of an enemy group. It's too late, there is nothing you can do. I have already won.
---
huh. TIL.
---
is that specific to C5s?
---
The krabs are running in anger to unsub, while the old guard PvP men stand ready to smash that sub button
---
Same story in C6s, and I believe C4s cannot have kspace OR wspace roaming holes. C1 through 3 can have roaming holes of any type.

They operate on the Kights and Knaves principle. The only one you can trust to give an honest answer is the spy, but he is biding his time to take all your stuff.
---
You do realize INN is composed of authors all across EVE and you likely chain-read Imperium authors right? I mean was that even a thought?
---
You're referring to such a small fraction of the people who contribute to INN that you had to have specifcally looked for opinion pieces written by imperium members. Everyone colors their piece and everyone goes to INN to publish because it's the biggest.
---
They don't use because they are dumb. There is nothing that keeps someone else from using "your" tag.
---
No, you still can’t spell.

Your flair suggests that the correct answer to your question would be "Yes sweety, of course you are".

most importantly , no stacking penalty  .... :)
---
Fine, then it'll be pvp players galore instead of bot VNI's, rorq fleets, and FW site runners
---
I'm imagining the salt and tears of crabs that login and have no clue about this change.  They'll think they are so safe and won't even dscan
---
As a wormholer...

This is the perfect time to bring some drop dreads to an NPC Delve station for indefinite staging.

so i should go to high sec because ccp provides no reason what so ever for me to take risks?

Oh. OH.

Fellow Wormholer here.  I can't function without it anymore.  Recorded it and playing it 24/7 on headset.  
---
I am at peace with that.

---
One of the good things about small groups is that said problem is usually solved by just asking *"Hey guys, is that Loki that appeared for a moment on DScan ours?"*.
---
You can try copying your cache over when it's known good, then whenever it forgets just copy it back.
---
They've been around longer than the invasion...
---
Not too long, you'd cap out. :)

---
Why don't these small groups run into each other if all they want is a good fight? Anyone roaming into test or goon space know they are just going to get large numbers dropped on them, and then they will whine about not getting a good fight.
---
You just factor in the lootfairy cost as product shrinkage.

Please don't. I like the effect ~ the deep space sonar pulse sounds and feels cool.

Also it's a much more clear queue that you actually did the thing you wanted to do. Particularly if you're paying attention in a combat site or data/relic site.

Quick and easy guide on how to prep for lack of local.
---
Step 1. Learn your dscan hotkey. 
---
Step 2. Make deep safe. 
---
Step 3. Align to your deep safe while doing shit so you can bounce to avoid bubble traps.
---
And that is how you stay alive without local chat.
---
Ah yes, a variation of the "without miners, you'd have no ships to fly!" argument.  While common, it still doesn't hold water.
---
Nice meme. 10/10

I recently returned and was surprised by how safe low sec is. In the old days following an escalation into low sec or just going there in general was a risk. Now it's all industry alts hanging out in station or people passing through to big fights elsewhere. Other than the occasional Wingspan weirdo, I haven't ran into anyone trying to probe me down in like a month.

How is it blatant RMT versus stupidity?  Don't get me wrong, I know RMT is a huge problem, but why trust it to RNG?  This might have been RMT interrupted by a gank, but I tend to think it's just a dumb player who doesn't know about the vault. 
---
Real RMT wouldn't rely on RNG to transfer plex - it would be too risky and cost real money.  Why do that when you can just jetcan it somewhere secure?
---
Learn to read.
---
So, the way they will rat is... 
---
Everyone rats within 1/2 carrier jump range of staging. 
---
Everyone in Standing fleet
---
Since carrier ratting isn't AFK, if somebody says on comms and in fleet chat "im tackled", the cyno goes up, and the response is max numbers and best response time. 
---
Everyone jumps ontop of your little gang with sirens and dromis and schools your little gang in the ways of the krab.
---
High fives all round and everyone goes back to krabbing.
---
Sad but true.
---
..fine I'll resub
---
No we do that for the salt
---
DOWN DOWN DOWN YOU GO.
---
Already talked about a way to deal with that, but I'm not gonna share just yet. It's going to be interesting to see though.
---
Do we want them to know?
---
All the turbokrabs rage quitting is the change I'm most excited about.
---
indeed
---
yikes
---
dreadbombs become more effective and more cost effective.
---
They gonna permacamp every station?
---
&gt;  we generally play 12 hours a day, 7 days a week
---
So crazy (and envious) amount of free time aside, remember that skill training in Eve is passive. Shooting lasers more often doesn't make your character better at shooting lasers.
---
Also you can quickly get competitive by specializing. Most of you will probably go DPS, but some people should go logi (space healer) and others should go tackle or ewar (space caster? the guys who throw out debuffs).
---
Go back to messing with Horde
---
Often my internet is bit slower and i have no idea if the scan actually refreshed. Just add a toogle, don't remove it completely.
---
True ya. It does suck for newbie/anyone who can't rat/pve in a capital. It will be too easy for a hostile gang to sit cloaked in a anom and wait for the vni. I think the only counter would be to have a group of vni's in a squad running sites.
---
&gt;Why don't these small groups run into each other if all they want is a good fight?
---
They do often fight when they run into each other 
---
If you won't give them good fights why should you be upset when they kill your expensive excavators to spite you?
---
is it spread out and tackle everything? :D
---
But I was told you guys only wanted good fights, that must not be a lie.
---
Everything is still just going to say 'rigs in cargo'
---
Most of the value of the ships the l33t players fly isn't in the minerals.  That is a tiny fraction of the cost of pirate/faction/T2/T3 ships.

---

---
But the fleet hangar is big and ozone is plentiful, fuel bay can last MANY small jumps.
---
Response can be adjusted to scale with threat, so as to not stack jump fatigue on everyone at once.

Different fighters can be stocked to deal with region specific damage types tanking. 
---
My corp has plans for thera hopping this weekend already... Will be interesting to see how nullsec (and us lowsec dwellers) deals with it.

Because unlike the fake wars of nullsec, we don't have a channel for all the roaming gang FC's to "setup fights". We prefer the much more natural way of fighting people, roaming space and seeing what we come across. Much funner that way, than asking for a setup fight.
---
Speaking from my experience when i roam with corpmates, we do often fight random roaming gangs while in other people's space. We fight whoever is around that wants to fight with similar or greater numbers (depending on comp).
---
I won't be undocking any of my krabbing ships for the duration of this blackout to protest against it. If people want no local they should go into wormhole space.
---
Wormholer btw
---
What do you do when you can't get good fights? You go and get salt instead. Most likely every single person I know who does excav bombing (and I know most) would trade it for an actual fight in a heartbeat.
---
Here's the problem: no one gives fights anymore. They want roaming gangs to roll their faces across the keyboard and facesmash into a super drop, then shitpost in local about it afterwards. In that context; fuck yes we'll bomb your excavators. That shit is hilarious and easy as hell. But I'd rather have a fight.
---
Goons have the Pathfinders SIG.  They know how to roll holes, they know how to set up cloaky scouts, they know how to use d-scan, and are very comfortable in w-space.  Goons will be just fine my dude.  Cloaky Titans are definitely a thing in Delve too.
---
NBI - &lt;hull name&gt; will be popular too.
---
Maybe it's people who stashed plex, hoping it would keep going up, and are intrepreting ccp's recent actions as a means to drive the price down.  
---
So naturally these players might be trying to get rid of their plex asap.
---
yes, yes they are and they do
---
Enjoy getting driveby-d on station and being a meme killmail.
---
I'd rather die in a good fight that gets my blood pumping than kill yet another scrub-tier VNI pilot
---
I am looking forward to the PCU readouts over the course of this little, uh, experiment.
---
A lot of people will. I think this will bring forward a delayed null sec local 15-30 seconds.
---
Sounds fun. Nice initative. Good hunting.
---
This pls.
---
Lots of people are overestimating the amount of server data something like dscan needs. Far more data is transferred every moment your ship moves...position data, velocity data, status of all modules, etc. The servers can handle literally *thousands of ships* all on the same grid, transferring all that data, including all the module behavior, damage states, cap regen, etc., every server tick.
---
If dscan automatically refreshed it would use less server power than having a ship on grid by a significant amount (dscan only needs to know ship type and position). The servers would not even notice a 2 second continuous dscan ping.
---
No, the reason is purely gameplay, just to make it easier to hunt assuming players get lazy and don't hit the button. That's why they didn't even implement hotkeys for dscan until a few years ago...for a long time you had to click a button manually, and there was a lot of consternation when they made hunting "easier" by adding the ability to press a button instead.
---
The idea that they are concerned about server lag for dscan has no basis in reality. At all.
---
I mean, the drifters caused a spike in the number of recruits flocking to wormhole corps (probably because they don't want to keep putting up with Mittens'/Gobbins'/Whoever's bullshit), so yes, it's likely.
---
Hey guys anyone want to run. L4's with me ? Pimped out Marauder's only.
---
So.... wormhole space.
---
Haha.
---
I mean, you weren't going to undock anyways, so I don't see how anything's changed.
---
it is incredibly easy.  takes almost no programming skills.  98% of bot building is putting in quality of life stuff, the basic warp to site, kill things, warp to new site is a fucking joke to program.
---
That's primarily due to lower player count. When eve was hitting 40k players, high, low and null was active. I miss seeing gate camps everywhere
---
It takes way too fucking long to anchor given that a cyno is instant. 
---
I think cyno cycles should be adjusted and the cyno should only go up at the end of the cycle. Have an accompanying animation when it is spooling up to give time for the opposing fleet to respond to the cyno, either GTFO or try to pop the ship before the cyno goes up.
---
I would also make it so the cyno jammer doesn't take that much longer to anchor than a cyno cycle so only someone who is paying attention and responds quickly can get the cyno up before the jammer goes online. Right now they have a whole minute to light their cyno
---
God damn you didnt even bother looking at zkill did you?
---
Tackle all the things
---
You didn't unsub that quietly since you're posting it here.
---
I'll just resub to balance it out for you though.
---
K. Thx. Byeeeeeeee
---
Your salt only validates my statement.
---
the new problem is that there is nothing to fight over.  Sov is pretty much worthless except when under a super umbrella.  There will be some fights over tackled supers and rorqs, but those are nothing new.  a few bots will die before they get new programming.
---
I could get behind this. 
---
Would also be cool if the ship jumping into the cyno had to spool up their jump drives first... Like the MJD has to spool up, so has the jump drive... The bigger the ship, the bigger the spool up time....
---
CCP didnt do this when NCPL had the most, why would they do it now?
---
&gt;If dscan was automated I'd expect perma tidi, or something to the same.
---
Not even close. The servers wouldn't even notice automated dscan. All it's doing is requesting current position data and type of ships, information the server already has. You cause more server lag by being on grid with another ship than by hitting the dscan button, and the game handles hundreds of ships on grid with one another before tidi even comes close to happening. Automated dscan causes no more server lag than automated local: i.e. virtually none. Same when you manually press the button...the server hardly notices the request.
---
The reason dscan isn't automated is to force players to divide there attention and make hunting easier. There is no technical reason to do it. This is the same reason why they avoided making a hotkey to dscan for years...there's literally no difference between clicking a button and pressing a key, so why did the dscan hotkey take years to implement?
---
The reason isn't technical. It's gameplay. Period.
---
Dotlan, zkill, pirates helper, Wormhole trackers, all of it.
---
Shut down CREST. No API data in or out.
---
prices will not go up.  There is so much extra crap laying around.  and will the decrease in ratting, fewer shit is going to die.
---
Reading is hard, and 1200 words is a lot when you struggle and read at a null sec level.
---
You get a regular size violin
---
Have you considered a less boring playstyle?
---
I read this in John Lennon's voice.
---
no, thats not how umbrellas work or jump fatigue.  The same tactics will work.  if you catch something small (sub caps) it will die.  If you catch something big and there is an umbrella, it will live.
---
Test alliance best alliance - no enemy will copy that
---
I feel the bots will always be faster than us mere mortals and will get out of a XXXXXX far faster than a regular player. I also wonder how many there are in NS / LS versus HS.   
---
In HS they can get lost in the noise.
---
It's failed RMT, if you were actually selling ISK you can do it through corp hangars, corp wallets or safespot jetcans/ejecting. They were likely travelling to a safespot, but got blapped on the undock.
---
/u/squizz you must help us
---
&gt; dangerous for everybody again,
---
still safe under the umbrellas.  small corps / alliances get fucked though.
---
&gt;  Big blocs like to get into fights they know they will win. 
---
Ah yes. As opposed to the big brain small blocs that prefer to take fights they know they will lose.
---
no that’s not at all what a shitpost is. people need to stop equating badposting with shitposting.
---
It's not a technical issue. You make a call to the server every time you issue an order to your ship, every time it moves, every time you activate a module, every time a ship lands on grid, *everything* you do causes server calls, most of which send larger packets than dscan.
---
It took CCP years to implement a hotkey for dscan, and even that was controversial at the time. And the cooldown is new...you used to be able to dscan as fast as you clicked. If it were a server issue, why mouse only? And why would a cooldown be *added* if the servers could handle no cooldown previously?
---
No, the reticence to add a hotkey and the additional cooldown were both for the same reason...gameplay. They wanted to make it harder to notice incoming ships and requiring manual input requires more attention than a passive scanner.
---
Their servers wouldn't even notice the change. But hunters would, and that's why it's not automated.
---
Side note: there's one other factor. A big part of dscan is noticing changes in things around you. If it automatically updated and you glanced away for a second, you might miss an added or removed ship. So there's an additional potential gameplay factor involved.
---
Thank fucking god
---
We'll see how long that lasts

And I farted quietly as I read that.

I'll see if I can find a link. I read something a while back where one of the Devs stated it was for performance reasons. 
---
You do make calls to the server when you perform actions. How often are you making those calls though? Imagine constantly making a call for D-scan to the server every tick and the server having to evaluate every call and evaluate each object that needs to appear on D-scan. Then multiply that by the number of characters in the game in space, regardless of what they're doing. It adds up.
---

There are definitely people out there who are willing to pay big ISK for a 2003 toon, even if it has 0 SP. Make sure you get a good deal. Nowadays you can create a new account with Recruit-A-Friend and start off with over 1 million skill points, most of which is unallocated so you are free to assign those starting SP wherever you want.

I'm trying really hard NOT to resub i dont have time... These changes just look so fun though.
---
Personally I think d-scan should require a module to use and it should have a longer cooldown, but that's just me.
---
This was my take as well. Someone above posted that "super cap fleets are going to dominate everything now..." I don't think so, EVE players that have those fleets are all chicken shits that only want to blow stuff up with a very minimal chance of loosing anything. This change will mean they have a chance of a bigger fleet waiting for them...
---
Eve has sounds?
---
We are starting up a writing section
---
Yes , but bots have a hard time with all that. I am glad those will be inconvenienced.
---
Yes, the second promise put him in a contradicting spot, correct.
---
And like I said: THAT WAS A MISTAKE. Of course it could have been prevented by carefully considering everything. But still, mistakes happen and implications are forgotten... It's not vily's (RL)job to manage TEST in eve, and even in RL jobs, countless mistakes happen that lead to promises broken..

---
The VNI was already a solid PVP ship, and I have the feeling that it's getting a buff in that direction with the comming changes.
---
obviously you have little idea... 
---
The second front was a remnant of stainwagon, once again tried to push and reinforce stuff in esoteria. Which is 100% defensive.
---
The push against FRT is offensive, correct. Although, that front was heating up even without our declaration of war. I mean, they scratched the NIP countless times before it ended. And in the end, they broke it.
---
3 Day before it's time out, so it didn't really matter. But it shows that that situation was also not 100% unforced.
---
Anyways, like I said. It depends on how you define "unforced". I would say it's not really unforced. But it also was not a necessity to make it either.
---
At that point you might as well merge it into the overview, but you made me think of active radar on submarines which may be a cool game mechanic.
---
What if they made it so d-scan increased your range-detected distance from 200km to 1 AU for a few seconds (say, 5). If you d-scan every once in a while it'll still be a bit more difficult to be tracked down without probes, but if you were to turn on auto-dscan, you'll essentially be detectable up to 1AU at all times. You'll have eyes on your surroundings at all times with the drawback of being easier to warp into. 
---
It'd be neat to add a level of complexity to scanning mechanics and would feel more like naval warfare. Seems like a fun addition to me.
---
How many nerds will quit over this? A few sites reported that "players threaten to quit" so...
---
Okay. Quit. Buh bye.
---
My first thought too. I actually got to do the live visuals for them recently, and while their overall sound has changed a bunch over the years, they still closed the night with FTS :D
---
&gt;could be said about hunters
---
I mean you could say that. Doesn't make it right, but you could say that.
---
Right now I have an invasion guide in the hopper
---
&gt;At some point it becomes new member unfriendly because to "try more" means you've got thousands upon thousands of people in front of you, more established in the alliance, with preferential treatment and access
---
Except that's not actually, ya know, true.
---
Let's say you actually joined Dreddit and want to make your name as an FC.  To do so, you: 1) Come up with something to do in cruisers or smaller, 2) go to the appropriate spot in Discord and ping.
---
Ta-da! you're now an FC.  Your fleet even gets SRP.
---
The fact is there is constant churn of space-important people.  People get busy in real life.  They get burnt out.  And so on.  Which means there's a constant flow of formerly-unimportant people into more important roles.  No, you're not going to be leading alliance stratops or in charge of all logistics on day one, but it's not nearly as hard as you claim to get your foot in the door.
---
yeah Jin'taan is great, I just can't watch videos at work haha. Articles on the other hand just look like I am doing my regular research job.
---
60's retro future aesthetic all the way
---
I love finding groups that have a 'unique' identifier, makes it so much easier to hide in their hole.
---
IMO, the hardest part to learn is the structure of wormholes and what they all mean. Wormhole types, mass limits, all the strategic stuff about critting holes or rolling them, there's a lot to learn.
---
Nope. No need for me to deflect. I just dont rat that much and when I do, I choose to rat in hostile space.
---
WEEWOO WEEWOOO WEEWOO!!!
---
The "as the system stands now" is telling. They likely use some sort of inefficient server update system for dscan then. From a technical standpoint, there is no difference at all between another ship being on grid and hitting dscan; in both cases the server is being polled by both clients to give nearby data. Every time another ship acts on grid you receive their updated data, if you didn't, you wouldn't be able to see what the other ship did.
---
There is no possible way dscan information contains larger packets than standard ship data. They must have dscan written in a way that it is checking multiple grids in a loop or something, which is bad programming, not a technical issue.
---
Modern games send real-time physics data for thousands of bullets being fired in moments, it is simply not possible for generalized position and ship type data. All the server needs to do is determine if the ship is in a specified range (which it already does to see if ships are in system and/or on grid) and at a specified angle (a Boolean check) then send back to the client a double and a integer (distance and ship type). Every tick your client sends and receives FAR more data than this just flying in a straight line.
---
CCP also took years to add a toggle for reversing zooming in and out, so forgive me if I'm a bit skeptical of their claims regarding the difficulty of technical things.
---
&gt;you'd have to be dumber than a box of rocks 
---
So your average null krab
---
Oh man, the jukebox! That takes me back! 
---
(Retuning player after 7 year hiatus - been back 1 week... man I missed EVE)
---
Sounds like a participation trophy. We do not reward bare minimum participation. If you want kill marks, get a real ship.
---
Best suggestion ever!
---
Why, only the best one of all!
---
www.minerbumping.com
---
Well considering if I were to utilize all of the miner accounts available that would be 23 accounts. Say we use 2 for scouts and 1 for boosts. That leaves 20 accounts for mining. Average nullsec miner can make around 40m ISK in materials per hour in a procurer. Only equates to 800m isk an hour and you think I'm worried about spending 40m isk on mobile scan inhibs?
---
Why is this a big deal? I swear I played this game a lot, but I guess not enough.
---
Yeah it’s all pretty bad. My IP says I live in Brisbane, but I actually live about 1900kms away from Brisbane.
---
Mmmmmmmsalty
---
EVE actually runs a synced simulation for all movement; whenever you issue a command like approach or orbit, the server lets all other objects on grid know the coordinates or object that is being navigated towards, and then the server and all clients simulate this movement separately. No further traffic is generated until the ship issues a new move command, even if you start colliding with other moving objects.
---
In very rare cases, usually involving a very large amount of ships, some people start seeing ships in the wrong location, even their own. When that has happened, those clients have for one reason or another arrived at a different simulation result than the server. That's why we call it a desync.
---
Something very similar goes for the other things you listed, except for module activations (will notify each time it cycles), and damage (will notify on taking damage or repping, but basic shield and capacitor regen is calculated client-side). In general, EVE will try to send as little data as possible.
---
you obviously don't know me;)
---
I actually think highseccers are even more important to Eve than nullseccers. And for sure I'm not for blobbing everyone to death.
---
I mean yes, as a nullsec alliance the objective comes first. But you simply don't have to call the armada to fight a hand full of defenders. And we often don't do that, thankfully.
---
Anyways, I think it's a great opportunity to get into PVP for many highseccers, that want to try a low risk, low effort, little time investment PVP. I can well remember my time in Highsec, and it was lovely, but boring. Roaming with friends was rare. And I would have loved some nice pvp (not speaking about ganking pirates, glad those have a hard time now). So I moved over to FW, where I learned to fight (die) in small disposable stuff. 
---
And there I also learned: You can always be useful and annoying, against any blob, any circumstances in ships that you have enough isk to fly for days usually...
---
How about permanently?
---
I’m on the NBN, but my IP address says I live in Brisbane. I actually live about 1900kms away from Brisbane.
---
If you're PvPing in corvettes you're doing something wrong.
---
Na.  Normal capitals won't have enough buffer to survive.  Their main defence before was align and warp when something dodgy arrives in local.  
---
No local in null is a massive nerf to caps and subs.
---
Not if they are krab fit. But a pvp fit carrier that cynos immediately has a chance
---
It's only bears worried about losing out on max gains granted a new change. Standard market reaction.
---
Could someone explain to me what it's all about? I've barely started but I'm interested and I'm having trouble coming back when there are so many other games I want to play on my new pc
---
You have no idea what my playstyle is and you're probably a high-sec pubbie.
---
What the fuck is with their obsession with the retard-helmet design?  They're turning ALL of the gallente ships into that same thing.
---
Lies. A meme battle is the highest art form of pvp. Next you’ll be saying that an industrial pvp fleet is “something wrong”. For shame, sir. For shame.
---
If you get scrammed, kill the thing dumb enough to scram you. Same strategy as any mjd bs. It takes skill but that’s the concept behind the fits.
---
Time to spread love in Hi-Sec
---
What if i like to eat the crust?
---
The real trick is to only pay them like 5% of the value of their labor, just like a real business owner. If they bitch just go off on how the corporation is like one big family and you're trying to build to accomplish big things in the future, like conquering nullsec or something. If they still won't shut up, distract them with an external threat. CODE and Goons are both great for this.

As far as a specific default binding that should exist ---&gt; click scroll wheel = toggle tactical overlay
---
They did, but it was due to bad coding, not technical restriction. There is nothing special about the information in dscan, all that needs to be sent to your client is distance and object type. Everything else is simply a server database filter, which the servers are specifically designed to do.
---
The call is not the issue, it's the way they're calling. Every ship on grid is sending and receiving data regarding the state of everything else every tick. If they didn't, you'd desync with the server the moment someone did something else.
---
The evaluation is a pure distance and angle check, something the server already tracks so it knows what is entering grid. All the calculation is done server side, and this is already being checked for every ship in a system...otherwise the game would have no way to tell you who is in local and whether or not they should show up near you.
---
The data is already being sent and received. It's likely they're using some legacy code that uses an inefficient algorithm for dscan and just didn't feel like updating it. But it's not a server limitation.
---
I think someone asked at Eve Vegas or one of the other events recently about having D-scan work automatically and Fozzie said the server couldn't handle everyone pressing d-scan at once every 5 seconds.
---
Oh yiiisss!! I'm the luckiest man!! ACCEPT!! ACCEPT!! ACCEPT!!!!
---
I just unsubbed **quietly**.... says the guy who posted for everyone to see on reddit.
---
Having people like you unsub is still nothin' but net as far as I'm concerned. Us cool ppl will be having a blast out there.
---
So... As u were
---
and lowsec, and npc null, and increasingly highsec.  Basically everywhere else.
---
I'm sure some of the FCs of standing fleets are terrible, but when BB or some other group is out hunting, most competent umbrella FCs call for specific people to jump on each save to make sure there are plenty of reserves for the next save and the one after that and the one after that. For blackout, the big blocks will have more than enough faxes and supers logged in to nonstop save anyone that is worth saving.
---
&gt; crabs  
---
brain dead
---
Seems like null-secs will be filled by people with intensively high paranoia and shitty attitude 👍
---
If that module could auto repeat, sure
---
250 players hit dscan, the pings echoing back and forth crashes the server.
---
local? forums?
---
TBH even if this is the case it's a good thing for the game to make them all unsub like this.
---
Sure, CCP will take a hit, but they've got a nice Korean safety net. The game might come out of this whole thing healthier and on an upward path again.
---
The game has to know if a ship is on grid with you at all times. It has to check if you're flying through a bubble. The server is keeping track of the location of every ship in system already. Local is keeping track of all other ships there, and updates in real time.
---
Adding dscan to the list of things updated in real time is simply not that much data. There is no difference between the server checking if a ship is on grid and if a ship is in dscan range.
---
The servers can handle thousands of ships on grid with each other and people spamming chat messages hundreds of times a second. I do not believe for one second it can't handle an average of 10-30 ships dscanning in a system. In fact, we already know it can do this, because ships can and do dscan all the time either via macros or habit, and it doesn't slow down the server.
---
yeah their sound changed around 2012-13 and that's i just couldnt listen to their new stuff anymore, but my favorite song is probably electronic stereophonic or breakbeat junkie.
---
With the amount of desperation you have in posting that I expect that either he isn't, or he is but you have line members in perfect agreement with him.
---
  tell them all to get fucked. ..   priceless

Only time will tell.

Just imagine the server load in large battles
---
Can't wait for Joe Biden to kill you.

I mean cure cancer.

Same thing.
---
Ask olmeca and marshy, they've been camped for months
---
:) That's cause I'm a cheap fuck.
---
Hey, I've run my fair share of meme Venture fleets. Shit's hilarious when you pull it off.
---
But the point of those meme fleets is that you're deliberately taking ships which normally aren't viable in PvP and using them unconventionally and in large numbers to get some meme kills. Expecting to take a corvette out on your own and have it actually be viable is expecting too much.
---
Mic drop.
---
i still dig ccp .. never have dug buying sp , injectors bs like that .  but did enjoy it way more 2010 - 2012 time period
---
That dank 33mhz
---
But but, how will mah bots be able to speak on comms? - I'll have to ragequit my 15 plex'd vni alts until this madness is fixed!
---
On a serious note, between reddit and facebook I'm seeing more or less equal numbers saying they're going to unsub as will resub ... CCP would you be willing to release the difference in the number of active omega accounts after the blackout?
---
The cloaked Proteus does not hide, it watches
---
I'm saving this and really hoping I can link it in various threads in two days while laughing my ass off
---
is corporation friendly fire a legal act ?
---
Alt-F4
---
Pussies wont unsub.  Theyre too addicted and feel they feel the sunk time fallacy.
---
If they quit now they cant justify the hundreds of hours spent in game.
---
All-time ugliest ship, I think, was the original Crucifier. It looked like two fingernails glued to a hex wrench.
---
Two dudes that probably have all their stuff in 1 station?
---
As a NS dweller I'm looking forward to the blackout.  
---
[https://i.imgur.com/pku168o.gif](https://i.imgur.com/pku168o.gif)
---
Just adapt
---
I agree with not being interested in the F1 monkey playstyle, but as a small gang nullsec dude, you can still get fights in null it's just a lot more ~effort~
---
Also, the drifters will very quickly destroy any sub-capital ship ratting. Even if you are at the keyboard and on voice chat, the drifter fleets will destroy all subcaps and most carriers before anyone can warp to help you. I think that until the drifter invasion is over/fixed/nerfed, people who mine/rat will need to be in supers.
---
I don't speak for anyone, but I did watch some of the meta show last week and the Imperium line seems to be mildly in favour of the blackout, in contrast to the drifter invasion thing.
---
For myself, I think that CCP need to be radical at this point. Any small change is "wrong". (That is, it's not that there aren't small changes they could implement that would make things better, but the idea that small changes are enough is dead wrong.)
---
This is the truth right here. Everyone in my group stops playing when a few key people stop. Once they start up again, the entire group resubs.
---
Hey! We've run an internal all Corvettes tournament; it was hilarious.
---
Lol wat, I am really looking forward to the blackout, but, from both a lore perspective and a practical perspective I don’t think that it will last forever, so, I’m hoping that observatories are how they end it.
---
I support this attitude.
---
Meet me in D-P I'll 1v1
---
It depends on the wh group as to whether it's bad practice, neither of the big WH groups going one on one would ever copy symbols, out of respect and honor, but it depends on the group. Null groups however, I don't need to answer that I don't think.
---
Wow
---
Why
---
&gt;  a lore perspective
---
Something that does not matter at all
---
Same. Sad fuckin times duder
---
I live 19 jumps away from jita. I have stashes for ammo, fuel (blocks, isotopes), ozone, nanite.
---
For small t1 hulls, I own bpos and haul minerals (due to lower volume). For t2 sometime I invent, sometime I buy, depends if I can make money selling the extras from invention/t2 manufacturing and if I can deal with the 2-3 weeks delay.
---
For everything else, I have a Deep Space Transport alt. If I need to haul truly voliminous stuff, I'll pay a freighter service or an alliance mate to move it either directly to my lowsec staging or to a nearby highsec where I can move it with a dst in a manageble number of jumps. Especially for large and low value things like t1 battleship hulls where I can just black frog / pushX it to a nearby citadel.
---
Almost seems like the blackout has been caused by lore...
---
1. Remove infinite combat anoms spawn
---
2. Add cyno spool timer
---
Until then CCP can go fuck themselves, no more ez resub baits.
---
I mean except it is, anyone roaming into space covered by one of the umbrellas isn't going to get good fights, they are going to get dropped by caps. So either they are either lying to themselves or are lying about wanting good fights.
---
/u/squizz you’re our only hope
---
If you think that you really have no clue about how things work
---
Lol please do enlighten me
---
Except wormhole space doenst have gates or Covert cynos. And if that's by design that's an awful mechanic for all space, ccp could at least make it repeat so you don't break the dscan key.
---
Thank you!  The [content](https://zkillboard.com/br/109784/) for Chapter 2 already happened... (and chapter 3, [although](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77275035/) that'll be short but hilarious)... 
---
"bong"....
---
with botting heavily suppressed by local blackout, at least for a little while, there should be a deflationary effect on ISK
---
so, here's your liquidation
---
“5,900,000,000 AU”
---
How the fuck
---
This sound as an PEBKAC situation.
---
this is a fun change. However I will miss that "oh shit, its happening" feeling when you and your fleet see local spike by 100+ people.
---
Then I would suggest not roaming space covered by one of the major blocs and I didn't mean you. But many people here act like they will be going to delve for kills, but those won't be fights those will be shiny kill mails.
---
&gt;You can't compare null sec to wormhole space because there are no cynos and jumpr drives in wormhole space, So making it easier to drop big fleets on unsuspecting targets will just strengthen the game style of only using caps/supers and only under a huge super capital umbrella.
---
I'm not a fan of null (lowsec4ever) but this seems like one of the most retarded ideas anyone has ever come up with. Gate's don't have mass limits and respawn connecting to different systems. You can't establish hole control, you can't role a gate until it's nearly critical, You can't tweak your sound settings so you can hear when someone has taken a gate from the other side of the system. Trying to turn null into WH space is just appeasing the shit tier pvper who want nothing more than a barrel full of fish and a stick of dynamite to kill them with. I'm genuinely more worried this could cause a mass exodus of players and kill eve in the mid to long term.
---
OK, I get what you're saying. Maybe there is a way they can do it, if they did a rewrite of how D-scan worked. I'm just saying the last I heard about the way the current system works, it makes enough of a performance impact that they didn't implement it to automatically scan for players and the 2 second delay was to help with the performance impact. 
---
If you can find a link or something that talks about it, I would be happy to give it a read.
---
I would like to see more changes to cynos too. In particular you need to not be able to light them instantly, or not jump to them instantly, so the 'decloak + hot drop' isn't so dangerous. However, no local is still a huge step forward and brings a level of risk to nullsec that it's long been missing.
---
Gameplay is far more important than lore in Eve and it's pretty clear when you read [this](https://www.eveonline.com/article/pufecw/48-hour-warning-nullsec-local-blackout) that it's no way shape or form a lore event but a gameplay one.
---
Ironic flair is ironic
---
So you roam space and do things that won't get you a fight and say I am wrong and you actually are looking for good fights? Why don't all these groups who want good fights run into each other?
---
They should do local like in blackholes, EVErywhere
---
Another dumb thread that left reddit for the forums
---
Wonder of it was the guy who tried to manually fly to jove space.
---
Even if that's true (and that's a lot of illegal multiboxing alphas), it's still better. You can still dcsan before breaking gate cloak, you can still wormhole in, they are unlikely to watch every gate, and you can still lay logoff traps.
---
Most of the hunters in Delve run from my solo pvp ships, let’s not pretend they are looking for an actual fight. Seriously last time I had an AF gang running from my Deimos, was actually sad.
---
Inch by inch the game is moving in a different direction between cap nerfs, anom nerfs etc. CCP is taking a direction and if you don't like the direction you sell all your shit and trade it for stuff in a new game or sell it to pay some bills. Not really concerned with following the eula on your way out.
---
A lot of dudes cashed out when korea first came in, or when all their favorite devs got shit canned, or any other numerous failures, disasters or game decisions. Can't say for certain either way but it's not outside the realm of reason that a few dudes sell their titans or extract and go get 1,000 exalts and a headhunter in Path of Exile or a pile of Wow gold and couple years subscription to wherever their gaming journey takes them.
---
Counter to that: if epithal gets tackled on a poco, move all your pi to the poco. Epithals are cheap, who cares if one gets popped. You won't get the extra isk from the pi contents on the killmail this way.
---
convenience, also it better and safer for a gank to be set up as with you just bridging ontop of the enemy can be really chaotic, and if we are talking about multiple targets in the same system you are able to set up a synchronized catch way better that way. Also you could bridge t3 cruisers in and then refit in system into proper combat fits.
---
We won't get a fight _no matter what we do._ We could show up in most regions in whatever comp we want and get supers dropped on us. It doesn't matter. 
---
&gt; Why don't all these groups who want good fights run into each other?
---
Why don't we fight you? Why don't we fight whoever the fuck we want? Why don't you stop complaining about pvp in a pvp game?
---
God I wish a /r/OutOfTheLoop for this
---
Free real estate
---
Make all names and flares be in Triglavian lettering for the day.
---
I agree with you that gameplay is more important than lore, but, it seems to me that CCP has been using the events of the triglavians, drifters, etc to implement mechanics into the game. So, when I say from a lore perspective, I mean that logically the drifters have to go away at some point (either because the beat the triglavians or because they lose to them) and at that point the FTL comms systems that power local can either be “critically damaged”, necessitating the introduction of observatories, or they can go back to working as normal. My op was about how I think that CCP are using this event to implement observatories via these events and what I’d like to see the observatories do.
---
If you're mining, I don't have to combat scan for you anyway. I can D-scan, see an inhib at the anomaly, and warp in to take a peak, all cloaked up. Maybe your scout does spot me at the gate. I still have ample time to scout the system and determine what I want to do. You just have a small window to try to de-cycle and figure out what you want to do. We can both light cynos and watch shit pop. BOOM!
---
I want to shoot it
---
Like releasing npc drifters to unleash hell all over nullsec
---
you know.  For gameplay.
---
wtf no 😂
---
the dreads are camped that are used to drop on goons. that’s why goons camp it...
---
There’s also like 5/6 stations
---
To add further...you guys could blow stuff up a day after you sub.  Cheap ships and give the expensive guys a ton of grief while you skill up in real time.  Also, joining any of the larger groups would accelerate that dramatically as they would hand you free ships, skill books, etc.  
---
I understand you may want to stay independent as a group and that would be a blast.  Read up on where you want to start.  Faction Warfare, WH’s, etc.  
---
And welcome! 🙂
---
Nothing stopped gangs from doing this before the blackout, oh yeah I forgot, RISK ADVERSE!!
---
Trillionaires with hundreds of thousands of plex *definitely* want to see the price going *down.*
---
Low-sec is the best! :)
---
That's what I meant. Two guys that probably don't have their shit spread everywhere. They gonna camp everybody's else's shit in all day?
---
If enough people do this to bring the economy back to a sensible level then that's still a win.
---
And that PI still has to be moved and sold, that should be possible to attempt to gank too. Although we need a change to the incredibly safe JF logistics to make that a thing.
---
The fastest thing you could do in terms of skills is Exploration in WH’s.  Never guaranteed 100M/hour but certainly possible.  And you could be running sitea tonight.
---
Sure, I'll set up a convoy and bridge normal freighters with a titan?
---
Spot the retard....Found him!
---
Fozzy sov, citadels: Anything can be gamed. Doesn't mean CCP shouldn't try to shake things up.
---
Friday.
---
I suppose you can always hope. I think a lot of us have a different hope
---
Blackout from a non-krab perspective: bad because way less people will undock. The best solution would have been 15 seconds of delayed local upon entering system/logging in. Enough to have a slightly better chance at catching aware players, enough to completely destroy botting.
---
...and I believe it is the most beautiful ship in the game.
---
And do you roam into delve or esoteria looking for a fight, because many people here are implying they will be going for those reasons but also implying they aren't just hunting for shiny kills.
---
2nd this rationale - Skill-trading spreadsheets would do well to have hard RL currency avg field to help explain market trends during pack and plex sales.
---
I'm not but I will call them hypocrites for claiming they only want good fights, which they won't get un umbrella regions.
---
or !! BAD FIT !!
---
Let's the hunt begin
---
Perfect intel stopped gangs from doing this. 
---
regardless, it's funny to see people scream "risk averse" when CCP increases the risk in their very safe space.
---
Goons hellcamp those npc stations 
---
they have done it, they will still do it
---
What do you not understand?
---
&gt; aybe it's people who stashed plex, hoping it would keep going up
---
Why&gt;? you can just train for +5 implants and net 2,700,000 exp each month and sell each injector netting a 450 million isk profit monthly per character, right now. That's literally better than letting plex sit and accrue interest - requires no special deals or multiple training certs, profit just goes up with those added in.
---
Than you can talk shit all day about people who actually play eve and yell for CCP to nerf krabbing with zero knowledge or regard for the current state of krabbing. If you ever get tired of doing basically nothing and getting rich, you can just use your credit card to buy plex, trade for isk and still yell at ccp to nerf all those things people who actually play the game do. Imagine playing the game in 2019.
---
&gt; crabbing 
---
&gt; brain deadery
---
I see no difference
---
Pffftt haha.
---
This is great.
---
CCPls leave it blacked out for long enough to actually see the long term effect, and ignore the inevitable reeeing on day 1-14 from krabs used to their instant free perfect intel. This has the potential to make the game exciting in nullsec.
---
Well then I’m a modern day Bartle as well, moderation blackout all the way.
---
You stay in local for the 15 minutes even if you leave system. I'm not sure if you see people who talked before you entered when you jumped in.
---
It's the cyno that should be adjusted, not the JF
---
Probably the old abandon fighters method(?)
---
Fighters would warp to random and usually crazy distances, and you could then probe them down.
---
There were several other methods, all patched.
---
There is one inconvenient way that remains, but it also isn't nearly as far.

&gt; If you’re talking blops with a cloaky camper, you might see it in local but you don’t know they’re active until they decloak on someone. 
---
This is sort of true, but to fully use this feature you have to cloaky camp every system where your opponents could possibly krab, or they have the choice to go to systems you *won't* drop in. For people who aren't state actors or olmeca/mar5hy, this makes cloaky camping nowhere near as powerful as the local blackout. People who actually fly hunters through gates looking for targets will benefit heavily from the blackout.

Happened this Evening.  4 rorqs tackled in Delve by Inner Hell (I think).  They ran into their hole and rolled it when the umbrella arrived.
---
The weekend is only going to be different if multiple drops pull the umbrella out of shape with fatigue.  That would require some multiple-fleet coordination though, so I think it's unlikely.

Well, but we're talking hundreds of billions invested per player, its probably more convenient for them to just let it sit than invest time in a skill farm.

Scouts at bottlenecks will be a thing so intel will still kinda work.
---
Supercap umbrella will work just as well as it does now.
---
Less number of easy targets - people either don't undock, or move to other areas or plain unsub.
---
Also, they buffed wormholes by this blackout, if it's permanent there's no reason to stay in null and not make the move to jspace.
---
For me it will change the way I roam, instead of flying a solo Svipul i'll get myself a cloaky and a ceptor scout so less chance for me to die to a gatecamp or drag bubble that I cannot scout. I guess it's a win.
---
The solution is simple. If you have sov, you can turn local on or off. Any change happens after downtime. Give the players their own choice. What's wrong with that?
---
Shit only 1 of the 3 contracts is still available! FASTFASTGOGOGOCLICKY

But nothing stopped people fighting each other prior to the blackout, except for the fact that the majority of pvpers will only engage if they win. I lost count of the number of times we have chased away nuterals/reds or small gangs, they just won't fight other pvpers.
---
What's there to vote about? It is exactly like wormhole local, but that's about the only thing.
---
I'm complaining about hypocrites not pvp. I am saying any one who claims to be looking for a good fight but goes into delve killing excavators is lying about what they are looking for. You are free to fight whoever, wherever you want, just as we are free to bring supercapitals because we are not pretending to want a good fight.

In what way is a change to a cyno sitting on a keepstar going to keep me from freighting?

A lot of people think that this is just a buff to "whalers" or whatever, but a lot of people also forget that even the PvP'ers will be blind now; you actually have to work to see if there are actual people out there or not now. 
---
Overall it's going to promote more actual EVE skills (not SP's) playstyle, both sides can benefit greatly if they play smart. Of course, if you're just a botter, you're going to be screwed until you figure out another way to do what you've always done. If something is sure, botters always adapt :)

How is less numbers logging into eve the best change ever? Doesn't sound very healthy to me.

If he would be trying to just pocket some easy isk he would put it to 0.4%. Because its still less but 4x the tax. NS donut made a promised and as usual they got greedy as if they didn't already make 99% of the isk.
---
Oh, that's a fantastic idea!
---
If you are talking local as it is now, I disagree. I don’t like the way that perfect intel stifles content. However, if you are talking local as I propose in my post then I agree. Simply not installing an observatory or leaving it unfueled would be the sov owners choice.

https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/message/6708073/

Here's a conversation from 2016 going over basically the same technical things I was talking about. Some highlights:
---
&gt;(Random guy that understands CS): In our case, the dscan can be cached so that the server only sends information once for evey ship that changes grid. This is way less computing-intense than the overview : the overview sends every second the informations of the grid : modules cycling, speed vectors of the objects (drones, missiles, npcs, ships of course). Which is a LOT more computation than sending a cached data on request.
---
&gt;Steve Ronuken (CSM): D-scan requires you to check the range to _every_ item in system. Not just the ones on grid with you. That's a significantly higher number.
---
&gt;Guy: basically, not it does not, on the opposite it only needs to store the data of grids relations and grid contents.
---
&gt;Steve Ronuken: Whole bunch of changes required to make it work that way. 
---
&gt;(Just a wee tip. I've spoken with people who actually know how this works on the server. I'm not talking out my ass on it.)
---
&gt;Guy: that's why I wrote "Maybe it is poorly implemented and CCP doesn't want to spend time on it, but the present functionnalities could be automated with no cost."
---
&gt;There is no inherent strain in the dscan functionnality - and that is my point. People saying that dscan functionnality is a strain are wrong. The implementation can be, but with the grid system and the slow update of it( few grid appear, and few elements warp on average) the automation does not have to be painful.
---
Anyway, the thread mostly devolves into a bunch of ignorance from there, but the core issue is with the way dscan was programmed, not due to some inherent nature of the data itself. In a way I can understand this, having done software development myself...CCP was a small company making an MMO in the early 2000s expecting only a few small fleets interacting at any given time. They likely did a simple "poll all objects in system in a loop, send all objects that have range &lt; 14 AU." This is a very inefficient method, and is far less optimized than their other network code.
---
But if they wanted to they could *easily* do this. The point is they don't want to, not that they can't. It's a lot of work and if you examine the quagmire of just that thread you'll see a lot of people decrying the decision just to add a hotkey.
---
Why spend the effort to optimize the code when your players pretend like having to click a button is what is keeping people from noticing their gank as opposed to Netflix?
---
But it's still a gameplay reason and a programming reason, just as spending years to implement an "invert zoom" toggle had nothing to do with technical restrictions. It's also the same reason why you have to quit the Eve client to change characters...we know it's possible to switch characters at a character select screen, as literally *every other MMO does*, but you can't in Eve. Why? Because they programmed a bunch of stuff that assumes you aren't switching characters that happens during startup.
---
I cannot in good conscience call these things "technical issues." They're more accurately "don't give a fuck" issues.
---
&gt;The game has to know if a ship is on grid with you at all times. It has to check if you're flying through a bubble. The server is keeping track of the location of every ship in system already.
---
Dscan doesn't really have anything to do with grids. The game simulates grids separately, and a good reason for that is probably precisely so that local effects doesn't have to iterate through every single object in the whole system. Dscan however, since it doesn't care what grid you are on, would have to check objects outside of its grid, and run a distance check on every object compared to your ship.
---
&gt;Adding dscan to the list of things updated in real time is simply not that much data. There is no difference between the server checking if a ship is on grid and if a ship is in dscan range.
---
These things are not related at all. The server knows where you are, but it doesn't automatically have a list of all uncloaked items of the correct group that are within a specific distance from your ship. Having the necessary info to create something doesn't mean it's free to do so (sadly).
---
&gt;The servers can handle thousands of ships on grid with each other and people spamming chat messages hundreds of times a second. I do not believe for one second it can't handle an average of 10-30 ships dscanning in a system.
---
Would 10-30 ships spamming dscan constantly cause heavy load? No, probably not, but it would _significantly_ increase the traffic that has to be sent, as normally all those clients would not have received updates every two seconds unless in active combat (and even in active combat, the updates are very very small compared to a full dscan).
---
In large fights is when it gets really bad though. In a 2000 man fight, that's 2000 people getting info on _at least_ 2000 (realistically many times more) objects. If they all dscan every 2 seconds, that requires more than a million extra checks for the server every second. Could you realistically "dumb down" dscan to alleviate the computational issues? Yeah, absolutely. But that's not how it works right now, and that also does not address the large increase in bandwidth use.
---
&gt;ships can and do dscan all the time either via macros or habit, and it doesn't slow down the server.
---
Something a minority of players do while engaged in certain activities at limited times doesn't really prove anything about how it would perform if every single player did it always.
---
&gt; Local is keeping track of all other ships there, and updates in real time. [...] and people spamming chat messages hundreds of times a second
---
Chat, and by extension also local, has moved to a XMPP (Jabber) server(s) that are separate from the EVE cluster. The chat server doesn't really care where in the system you are, and it doesn't keep track of your ship. It just needs to know when you log out, take a stargate, etc.. Part of why they moved over to the new chat system was so that chat wouldn't impact server performance.
---
I'm not pretending to want a good fight when I'm killing excavators. I'm harvesting salt. I said as much way back in my first response. I'd RATHER get a good fight but as you just admitted - you don't want one. So, we bomb excavs instead.

As a person that was a part of the dozen man crew that came up with AFK Cloaking in 2006 I can firmly state that removing local neither boosts or diminishes the effect of cloak camping. Cloaking makes you immune to response gangs and hotdrops as nobody can figure out what you're flying or where exactly you are at any point in time. Those who went through the ISBAD program in Pandemic Horde that I set up with a few guys know how effective cloaking is in for almost all activities: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzW4SjBDcMk as a good demonstration of it in action. In gate camps we didn't bother worrying about being visible in local, what mattered is being invisible. Most PvPers will bounce to a celestial and D-scan the exit gate. What he sees is an empty gate so he tries rushing it only to have the Sabre decloak right as he lands and the gang decloaks and meets him on the far side. Even a few day old accounts could participate merely by bringing an ECM ship which allowed Veteran players to fly expensive and narrowly focused ships with impunity, it let the newbie do something extremely useful AND keep them alive for days as they're safe from reprisal. Doing cloaking against ratters follows the same pattern, pop the ratter with friends and duck out to a safe spot and cloak and not worry about probes and response gang gatecamps. The only time that the local aspect was effective was back in 2006-2009 when empires followed a feudal structure and restricted tenants to specific constellations which had maybe 3 dozen belts worth of viable ratting. Spread a 20 man gang across it and you shut the entire Alliance down. Now that space is normalized a ratter can just skip off to a different portion of space and ignore the camp.
---
I don't know, why would you? You're the one who brought it up.
---
who cares about fucking loser ratters?! They literally dont matter
---
nullifed t3cs warp too slow - they get decloaked AND a lot of time pointed before they get off the gate. Drifters are the best response to nullification, it's great!
---
Definitely works for gatecamps
---
FIXED: I have two bridgers, a bomb truck and 5 bombers. I'm pretty sure I will go insert said squad somewhere and cloak up for an hour or two and come back and find nothing.
---
Idk how you fit your t3cs lol but every fit I have is 5s or less
---
So, wait, you're getting hot dropped in a subcap? 
---
lmao
---
I did.  So far its been worth it.
---
So you want a good fight, but don't go to try and find one and instead bomb excavators, and are disappointed you don't get good fights, while bombing excavators? I honestly don't understand your logic.
---
Wormhole Hacker Gang *UNITE*
---
Ah, that is why Horde will prosper. We make due with very little intelligence.
---
The main threats super umbrellas are afraid of are dread bombs. You only need 1 ship to bring one... hiding it from local doesnt increase the risk. 
---
On the other hand, the local spike giving you a few seconds head start to get away from the hammer is now gone,  so attackers are less likely to bail successfully (something that is annoying).
---
So chance of death hasn't increased but chance of kills went up.   That's an improvement for umbrellas,  less fatigue for blue balls.
---
yeah they lock / decloak in 2s or so
---
Flair checks out.
---
That’s always a cool feeling tbh
---
I am saying going to regions with a super umbrella you should expect to get caps dropped on you and not be shocked when it happens.
---
As long as Dotlan still has the maps that’s fine.  Seriously, its much easier to navigate with the Dotlan maps.
---
Just cloak? Are you retarded?
---
Whaling fleets look for ganks, not fights.
---
Anyone saying they are looking for fights is lying and they generally just want multiple big single target engagements.
---
[Reeee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEdvFcWEhHo)
---
Safespot dropping is very easy to track for CCP and proffesional RMT'ers know that
---
I have a couple more tips as well. I listened to the entire clip and I want more but I had to often stop and relisten to what you were saying to understand parts.  
---
THIS IS MEANT TO BE CONSTRUCTIVE!!!! Don't take my advice the wrong way!!!  
---
* Pause after the end of a sentence, and pause a bit longer than that after the end of a paragraph (when you are moving on to a new concept). It gives time for people to process the transition and more importantly it help you keep your mouth moist which will help with enunciation. A few times you could hear your lips smack because your mouth was dry.
---
* Cut your recordings down to manageable cuts. Listen to it after finishing recording, if there is an issue re record it. This will help you improve quality and save time when editing compared to a single cut. I heard a couple cuts I think (didnt get into the nitty gritty).
---
* Try doing a dry run before recording, notice the trouble spots and pay special attention to them. Don't get tunnel vision, but you might notice a nice edit or two that will make it easier to say/spew, also it makes you much more comfortable before recording.
---
* Have a glass of water and a tongue twister to warm your vocal cords and tongue up. Trust me, its super helpful
---
I think you missed the point where the drifters actively decloak people
---
I think you will have a similar feeling when you press DScan and see an endless list of ships
---
Notepad is a thing
---
That's how nullsec used to be. Gangs roaming looking for a fight, whether they won or not.
---
So your line members say the same thing then. Gotcha.
---
Finally, automated combat fleets.
---
No, there is no difference. However, what does make a difference regardless of if you sub or not is making sure you use a Recruit-A-Friend code to create your account. It's a really dumb system IMO but the benefits from starting with a RAF account are too big to ignore. You start with 750,000 unallocated SP, which as an Alpha is well over a month's worth of skill points. (probably several months, really)
---
I think you missed the part that I’m warping off in 5 seconds or less
---
Which drives the prices down. 
---
Well, self fulfilling prophecy.
---
You're in Delve, can you blame them for being wary of somebody with friends everywhere around you?
---
If by "initial starting period" you mean the amount of time it takes to train the basic skills you'll need to get anywhere, that's doubled for Alphas. So yes, I'd say start with a subscription. EVE is a P2P game after all.
---
That...  Might actually improve zkill regardless.
---
I don't see an arc. It looks flat to me.
---
I'm looking forward to baiting aspiring bot hunters and whalers into weapons timers while my entire fleet is in system off dscan.  Should be fun until people catch on.
---
Dont worrie about me taking it the wrong way my friend criticism is appreciated. Il take it all on and try to improve me next one cheers for the write up.
---
As though anyone would turn local off.
---
I've been playing the game a very, very long time.  It takes a lot to get me excited.
---
I...what?
---
All you did was whine that it's not fun for you, which is fucking hilarious due to the overwhelming response when something negatively affects another area of space.
---
Just adapt bro, right?
---
And just because they said 2 weeks before then officially announced it doesn't Mena there was no talking before.. What kind of sperg do you actually have to be to think they just whipped this up in a week with no communication. The fact he brought it up in the first place IS the indication they had plans for it and had been working on it. Hilmar doesn't do shit anymore, so when says something it's either fluff or he's just being the mouthpiece of the company. Not some rogue element out to destroy your individual fun little null shitter.
---
No one feels sympathy, this is a long time coming and a good change. The only unknown factor here is if it should stay or be a temporary/infrequent thing.
---
You have no actual argument why it shouldn't happen other than "its not fun for me". So retarded lmao.

People who post about games on that game's Facebook page are the always the lowest common denominator, so that's no surprise.

We roam wherever the hole takes us. Last time we were in delve (about a week ago) we killed 2 nags and some random subcaps.

Let me guess. They prioritize logi or ewar ships. You must be a genious to figure that out.

This isn’t even effort any more... just take my downvote and go

Fair, just thought it was worth suggesting tho

---
It's all of the PVP resubs coming in for the blackout.

What's a dread cache?
---
Are you asking if null sec local *ought* to work like w-space local? Because that's a values-question, and has no wrong answer. I think that's what you want to ask.
---
Right now, the wording you've chosen is like asking does `1 + 2 = 3`? Don't be surprised if everyone does the metaphoric math, and answers `true`.
---
Negatory, you appear all over intel channels as long as you stay in a region, so people can just dock up when you're 1 jump out, or 5
---
First of all thanks for the response. I watched a video about this and neither it nor the guide explained whether this function is available if the structure holding the assets *is not likely or will not* be destroyed. Do you happen to know if the function works in any scenario?
---
ok, man, let me put this more clearly for you: The drifters are quick enough to both decloak and tackle most/all ships in under 3 seconds.

All those cloaky goonswarm campers will finally get a taste of their own medicine.
---
The rest of the nullbears for years have had to rely on dscan because of their abusing of game mechanics (indefinitely afk cloaked w/ cyno) but of course when the pain is returned they come here crying.  I brought my salt jar proud and ready, bless you CCP
---
So your anecdotal evidence is somehow more relevant than anyone else's. Interesting. First part of your message is accusing someone of strawman then you're defending the legitimacy of afk farming and trying to make a case that bots are less prevalent because someone with enough extra chromosomes to actually be there the entire time exists therefore you're the majority right lmao.

---
If the crabs unsub and hunters subscribe then the initial wave of subs may not last. Ideally you need to have a balance, otherwise the play style that is at a disadvantage will eventually go extinct.
---
\o/ another fantastic big bill post!
---
Oh it’s still illegal as shit, but do botters care? Good point with the logoff traps though.
---
Make an account, then google "eve online recruit a friend", log in onto that page, use the invite link from there and make a second account. Does not have to be a different email address as far as i recall.
---
Now this second account will get the bonus 750,000 sp as it was created with refer buddy link.
---
If you sub to omega the second account, then the first account that created invite gets given 350 plex i think. You can sell that for a hefty chunk of change. There other rewards etc. that first account gets when the second account buy various things.
---
First account you can keep training as an alpha into a scanning, exploration alt for example or a throwaway pvp alt - your choice really.
---
Your second account will be your main and that 750,000 sp saves you about two weeks of training as an omega.
---
If it were technically feasible I'd like to see an auto-dscan option. Maybe not as good as you can do yourself, like a 14,3 AU full sphere dscan every 15s or something. But it is a bit silly to make us all press V on a reflex.

What am I fundamenally not getting about industry? I'm just scratching the surface, so I've looked at a few items. Harpy as an example, if I load it into fuzzworks or eve-industry blueprint calculators, even with max ME/TE, no tax and max skills (whether I make all my components or not) runs a catastrophic loss. Does the supply/demand just cause the value in manufacturing things to ebb and flow like this? Or am I misunderstanding how to use these tools?
---
Yeah, those are all good points. 
---
I guess I should have been more specific in saying "The way the system is currently implemented...."
---
&gt; Dscan doesn't really have anything to do with grids.
---
It has to. If the objects are stored on grids, the data structure being polled for the system is based on that data structure. There is no way they have a separate data structure for objects on grid with you versus objects on another grid. You'd have to constantly be copying the data between two nearly identical data structures.
---
&gt;Dscan however, since it doesn't care what grid you are on, would have to check objects outside of its grid, and run a distance check on every object compared to your ship.
---
Correct. The game already does this for bubbles, your map, and plenty of other things. It has to determine somehow that other ships exist, it has to populate your overview with all objects off grid, etc. There is literally no difference between the calculation of your distance to a station or moon and another object. And since deployable structures appear as well it's not limited to permanent fixtures.
---
&gt; The server knows where you are, but it doesn't automatically have a list of all uncloaked items of the correct group that are within a specific distance and angle(!) from your ship.
---
It does, actually. The server is storing every single item in the system locally. All it needs to do is filter, which is something it is *already doing*. 
---
Let's say there's a battle happening on the other side of the system from you. Is the server sending all the data from every ship in battle? No...it only sends you what's on grid if possible. It's filtering out the stored data from ships that aren't near you, just as it filters them from overview.
---
Remember, the server knows where you are, and it knows where everything else is. The "list" is just those objects a certain distance from you. As your ship moves, you can see the distance between your ship and all celestial objects updating in real time. How? Because the requisite data is already there, the server isn't taking any extra effort to calculate your distance from a station or stargate.
---
You are vastly overestimating the computational complexity of range and angle checks.
---
&gt;No, probably not, but it would significantly increase the traffic that has to be sent, as normally all those clients would not have received updates every two seconds unless in active combat (and even in active combat, the updates are very very small compared to a full dscan).
---
No more than the server already sends you distance from a station, or handles a battle across the system. Dscan is polling existing data, it's not *creating* data. All you're getting is the result of a math problem, and a rather easy one the game does all the time with far more complexity.
---
&gt;Could you realistically "dumb down" dscan to alleviate the computational issues? Yeah, absolutely. But that's not how it works right now, and that also does not address the large increase in bandwidth use.
---
This is the actual issue. It's not that there is something inherent in dscan that makes it computationally expensive, it's that it's poorly optimized and has been since the game was built. The reason it hasn't changed is the same reason you have to quit the game client to change characters...not a technical limitation, but it would take effort to code a character switch so they aren't going to bother.
---
&gt;Something a minority of players do while engaged in certain activities at limited times doesn't really prove anything about how it would perform if every single player did it always.
---
I'm talking about technical limitations, not current implementation. If the game can handle the overview on grid it can handle a bigger "overview" with better data structure handling. Right now it's polling every object in the system and doing a range check, which is basically the absolute *worst* way to implement it. They're basically using the equivalent of bubble sort...works fine for small data sets, but bogs down on bigger ones. Like bubble sort, however, there are other solutions that work.
---
&gt;Part of why they moved over to the new chat system was so that chat wouldn't impact server performance.
---
That wasn't really my point. The point is that chat is far more *actual data* than the data being sent and received by dscan. In other words it's a matter of packet size.
---
If the game, and the clients (which are also a bottleneck) can handle thousands of chat messages per second, and they contain *less* data than a packet of dscan data, there is no technical reason why dscan data could not be sent constantly to each ship in a system. And by "constantly" we're still talking about "every server tick" which is *really, really slow* by modern server standards.
---
We already know the problem, as CCP has basically said as much...they'd have to rewrite dscan code to work better. And they don't think it's worth the effort, and neither do much of their player base.
---
It's a matter of "won't," not a matter of "can't." Which is fine, but I'm tired of seeing people act as if computers just can't handle two physics calculations and two floating point numbers over a network every second. Next people will be telling me it's impossible for CCP to let you change characters without relogging because software must be restarted for changes to occur.
---
I'm done with this community if anyone is retarded enough to believe lore is what leading CCP into gameplay ideas and not the other way around
---

Oh God noes I'll start lobbying to bring local back right away :((((

They'll just go play wow now
---
This is factual
---
What about asset safety?
---
You think that's bad.  Back in the day in Eve dscan wasn't able to distinguish between ship type and ship name, so you could appear on dscan in whatever you wanted.
---
With no local I think everybody will call their ship "Bait" though.
---
Not sure who's though, but it ain't you.

Respect and honour?  Pfffffttt.  In Eve that's always had killmail written all over it.

Welcome to 1929
---
kind of agree tbh. like it's just a circle
---
I don't want observatories at all.  It's just more junk people have to anchor and maintain and it'll be compulsory.  
---
A better idea would be some kind of group or fleet radar that shows pings across systems, the radius of which is somehow limited by a kind-of command burst.  It doesn't have to be perfect intel.  It can be a combination of player skill (and/or some kind of boost charge) + whatever the enemy is doing.  e.g. every action generates heat and heat can be detected, or something like that.
---
I didn't think it through but I know I'm against more fixed infrastructure.  It only encourages us to turtle down in a region.

You shouldn't be able to light a cyno in the docking ring of a structure.

Will evan McLean get a kill? Probably not but it will be hilarious to watch him fly in a post local outage world.

You shouldn't be able to open a HIC or DIC bubble within 50km of a cyno. See, I can make game changing arbitrary statements too.
---
oooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh still haz mai baibeis?
---
Very good information,  thank you!
---
Lol no it isn’t
---
The difference is that yours makes it even safer in nullsec, and mine removes some of the extreme safety.
---
Also, there's plenty of precedent for not being able to deploy stuff under a structure ring. You can't drop a depot/MTU/inhib etc there either. So why can you light a cyno, which is essentially a deployable structure?
---
Don't live in wormholes if you can't afford to lose it all. They didn't destroy your station because they hate you or out of spite they almost certainly did it because you were afk and it was a likely big loot pinata.

First time I ever tried to get into PvP and I was ganked by about 8 Snuffed Out guys. Wasnt all that fun, I was barely in a T1 fit Thorax...

I was more under the "I really don't want to pay to see if I would enjoy this game, but I dont want a hindered starting process by trying free" mentality.

Damn, imagine that feeling when you sell your video game stuff to pay a bill.

\#NoPoors
---
I would in certain areas. It would be more of a strategic use. You people constantly think one sided. Oh no, if I turn off local the enemy can walk right in! How about thinking that they can't see you either? You can also dock up and they'll never know how many you have until you undock and force hell upon them.

Use your brain instead of just whining.

Hello there

Nice, I do all that anyways. I've done my homework!
---
Because you're not listening. The people we like to kill don't give good fights. If they did, so would we. You want us to leave you alone because you don't give good fights? Tough shit. We like killing goons. A lot. So we're gonna stay, and enjoy harvesting salt, one excavator and idiot ratting super at a time.

Not enough self righteous cunts to be anywhere *near* SPD, though.

Thank you very much for your answer! That definitely helps!

By competitive do you mean in actual competition? Like qualifying for a tournament? Or do you mean capable of winning your fair share of fights? IE average.
---
I too want easy kills on moving capitals.
---
Remember when the standard unstretched grid size was 250km from center?

That's really kind of you to say! I'm in the final sprint on the Book 2 manuscript, and I need all the confidence boosts I can get.

...dude, I'm on the side of the hunters on this.
---
The ability to see everyone in your system is much more valuable to a sov holder than the ability to hide what's in system, because d-scan exists which basically neutralises that anyways.
---
If you disagree, just look at all the reeeing on Reddit over local being partially turned off. It's clear that, given the option, the major sov holders would have local on in 90% of their space 90% of the time, save *maybe* for occasional necessities due to war.
---
I've seen people ghosting tags, but it's rare. I don't know that it would be as rare outside J space though.

Yeah, no.

yes you a re a filthy scum sucking bottomfeeder and you deserve to be exploded over and over again a thousand times in your spaceship maybe you would have a good time with a cormorant in highsec belts or maybe hello kitty online would be a better game you don't really even need money you don't have a spaceship but you can grow potatoes

As someone who's yolo'd caps solo into HORDE for fun and lost dozens of pve ships, I agree

Moving it before they fuck with that too

This is an issue where there is no truly “safe” place for individuals or more casual players.  The community can disagree with me all it wants but you shouldn’t let infinite wealth level 100s camp level 1 zones.  Let them grow.

Instead, ask what would it look like if capitals didn't have Jump Drives.

Want caps to defend your miners? Move them in-system beforehand. Great, now the other systems are vulnerable.

&gt;CCP wont do anything that is already implemented by someone else and is working fine.

Ship fitting simulator would like to have a word with you.

As opposed to lack of intel
---
I'm glad you agree with my suggestion.
---
 I'm a new bro so I don't even have to readapt because I haven't even experienced what it was like before so I can't feel any type of way about it.
---
Seemed to work lol

https://youtu.be/PXKVnXFQuUA

I don't understand why you leaked intel like this. 
---
Why on earth wouldn't you secretly use it offensively against everyone?
---
Now the cat's out of the bag.
---
Are you.... taming drifters?
---
Curious what math you're using to get 450k isk profit per character?  
---
950m - Injector price  
---
445m - Extractor price  
---
3.8m  - PLEX price  
---
Per 30 days, you get 3.888 injectors out of a +5 implanted character, so you need 3.888 injectors and extractors.  
---
&gt;Costs:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;3.888 Extractors \* 445m =  1.749B isk  
---
&gt;500 PLEX \* 3.8m =  1.9B isk  
---
Total cost:   3.649B isk  
---
&gt;Revenues:  
---
&gt;3.888 Injectors \* 3.888 =  3.693B isk  
---
&gt;Profit:  
---
&gt;3.693 - 3.649 = 44 Million ISK  
---
How are you getting 10x that amount?
---
Think I might tag along with some buds.
---
I'm sorry, don't take this the wrong way, but this is just not how any of this works, at all. Programming is a powerful tool, but it is not magic. Just because you have a large amount of data you can read from, doesn't mean that performing operations on it is completely free, and it _definitely_ doesn't mean that sending all that data to a client is free on bandwidth either. 
---
Furthermore, you seem unaware of the concept of computational [complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity). A single grid running a check on a number of objects on its grid results in much, _much_ fewer calculations than all the objects on the grid running the check on all other objects on the grid. It is the difference between calculating something _n_ times and _n^2_ times. Whereas a grid with 1k ships on it only has to check 1000 distances, the dscans all combined would have to do it a million times instead.
---
You're also completely ignoring what I said that the server _does not_ constantly send you any of these distances. It tells you each object's position once, and then your overview calculates distance every single second to every single object. You can try downloading a lag switch, initiate warp somewhere, and activate the lag switch as soon as you get the "warp drive active" text. Your client will actually enter warp, move to its new location, and update all the distances in your overview, without being able to communicate with the server at all. The only thing it can't do is load any ships on the new grid.
---
I hope you'll forgive me for not answering each of your points respectively, but you seem to be basing it entirely on some wildly incorrect assumptions about how this works. Again I mean no offense, it's good to have some discussion going, but I don't think this is going any further.

---
Depends, bots don't rely on intel channels + if you're coming out of a wormhole/cloaky camping.
---
Trying to minimize losses i guess?
---
vote ： unancor
---
 Bots can d-scan more efficiently than humans, and wormholes can be spotted via the probe window. Cloaky camping is a moot point since the proposed suggestion is that local is only delayed by 15 seconds.
---
I believe that D-scan is long out of date and doesn’t really jive with the advanced technology of the EVE universe. 
---
So like it or not, it’s high time CCP overhauls D-scan and the innovative capsuleers of New Eden adapt to it. 
---
Perhaps a sonar instrument? You could have what we have now (although a much more highly upgraded and visual instrumentation) and do a passive scan, revealing limited information such as distance, heading etc. Or, you could actively “ping” and reveal precise details (at the cost of broadcasting *your* exact position, too) and “freezing” your ship for a predetermined length of time (the length of which can be modified by mastery of a new skill). 
---
Honey, I don’t know.  EVE will always heavily favor those who like to kill defenseless ships and unskilled players. Perhaps it’s time to change this dynamic to keep EVE healthy. 
---
Just one guy’s opinion y’all.
---
keep going!  I'm really excited for the next book.  I got the version with all the fancy pictures this time.
---
No local = no undock = no content. Can't be hard to understand that once people get used to it, they simply won't undock/risk anything expensive. Bad change for people who hunt expensive things, great change for people who are happy killing VNIs.
---
Delayed local = you still don't catch people paying attention due to EVE's mechanics but log-off traps become a huge threat.
---
Make a game that is worth my time an entertains me.
---
And no, daily login rewards and artificial achievement systems to trick people into spending more time with a game they don't actually enjoy is not what I mean. Stop analyzing your players and simply make a game that is worth playing like back when you had an actual grand vision about where you want to take this game.

Excellent! Will be glad to see you :)
---
My anecdotal evidence was relevant, even if it was anecdotal. This other motherfucker's wasn't relevant. Everybody knows there's bots. The point was that not everyone who is able to avoid getting tackled with their ratting ships is necessarily a bot... something a lot of people don't like to believe.

I never defended any sort of afk activity so much as pointed out that it can be done without cheating.

COMET ME BRO.
---
I do it for both
---
a shiny, salt encrusted kill is worth just as much to me as a close fight
---
I think there's just as much chance that it's a famine of people not willing to undock anything PvE at first.
---
Why would that be a problem?  
---
D-Scan and probes will still work.
---
You hit home :-(
---
You would like to kill an entire play style and ship type just so you can remain risk averse. Might as well just delete cloaks. Or better yet you can go back to high sec.
---
im poor: the post
---
I use argument people use to said "no free intel is great" to proof we need to go deepeer. If you siagree you're choice. But if you said local remove free intel , remove cloack for same reason. 
---
Or said the remove of local is for other thing.
---
Yea, I'd rather be hunting than be hunted.
---
Yeah we've got strategic reserves we can make it.
---
Bots can sit at gates and report traffic and dscan 🤔

Nope, all the salvage parts go into production, which is why certain items (intact plates, specifically) are a huge amount of your profit in WH krabbing.

Ahh, bummer, guess I'll have to see if it comes around again later.

I disagree.
---
Currently null sec local works like it does in highsec.
---
Tomorrow, it will work like in wormholes, I think.
---
Lol great idea!
---
Recons and cov ops cloaks though.  Dscan is going to be a poor substitute for the free instant local intel.
---
Couple months? Interesting. Thank you for input. I appreciate it.
---
Don’t you live in null ??
---
You shouldn't be punished for scheduled maintenance. Not everyone is familiar with DT, especially when it's not in their TZ.
---
I think they want a fight!
---
I came back and live in a wormhole now, highsec is still the scariest place I fly.
---
It shouldn't be surprising; I think this feature is a pretty prime example of Malcanis' Law.
---
Well-organized groups won't be heavily impacted, either because they're willing to organize and scout (Horde), or stay safely under their supercap umbrellas (NC/Dark), or both (Imperium).
---
(Also, if Observatories end up being a sov structure, then NPC-owned nullsec might become a worst-of-both-worlds due to the combination of no-local and cynos.  Delayed local works well in WH partly because there's limits on how much firepower an attacker can bring to a party.  Imagine what GW will look like in a few months if it ends up sticking.)
---
&gt; Programming is a powerful tool, but it is not magic.
---
I'm aware.
---
&gt;Just because you have a large amount of data you can read from, doesn't mean that performing operations on it is completely free, and it definitely doesn't mean that sending all that data to a client is free on bandwidth either.
---
Never said it was free. Said it wasn't more complex than existing calculations.
---
&gt;Furthermore, you seem unaware of the concept of computational complexity.
---
And you seem unaware of algorithmic ways to reduce complexity. I've personally written many of the data structures I'm talking about from scratch.
---
&gt;A single grid running a check on a number of objects on its grid results in much, much fewer calculations than all the objects on the grid running the check on all other objects on the grid. It is the difference between calculating something n times and n2 times. 
---
This is not true. In fact, you could do dscan *more* efficiently than grid.
---
Here's one example. Put all grids onto a map (the data structure). Link them. Each grid necessarily has it's size as a property (otherwise you wouldn't know how many grids would go in a system. You know the starting grid, you know the grid sizes, and therefore you can know *as a constant* the number of grids from your current location to all other grids in a map. You aren't dealing with a multi-kilometer (long integer or float) grid, you're dealing with a small number of grids (probably less than a few hundred) as values.
---
Because of this we only have to check grids within 14 AU, which we already know. Each grid will have all objects it contains stored in it, which is the size of the data structure. Therefore, we don't have to check every object in the system, we only have to check the few hundred grids near our grid and only those that contain more than one item, which *most won't*.
---
More importantly, you aren't sending data from every object, only those available to dscan. Each grid already contains the ability to tell where objects are (obviously) and you know the distance to grid, so you're using the same calculation the grid already contains plus your distance to that grid plus your location on the current grid.
---
The *current* implementation likely does what you're describing, and poll every object in the system, even ones that cannot possibly be in range. But there's no actual reason to do this. The same computer problem done two different ways can have vastly different Big O values.
---
&gt;You're also completely ignoring what I said that the server does not constantly send you any of these distances. It tells you each object's position once, and then your overview calculates distance every single second to every single object.
---
&gt;You're also completely ignoring what I said that the server does not constantly send you any of these distances.
---
I didn't say it did. I said the game already knows these distances. Which you are not disputing here.
---
&gt;I hope you'll forgive me for not answering each of your points respectively, but you seem to be basing it entirely on some wildly incorrect assumptions about how this currently works.
---
No, I understand how it *currently* works. My argument is that it's **not a technical limitation**. If you write something poorly, and it currently works poorly, it does NOT automatically mean that a better way is impossible.
---
You are saying that it would slow down the servers because of their current implementation. I agree. If they *changed* the implementation, they could do it without the same slowdown. That's my entire argument.
---
The dscan lag thing isn't due to some inherent computational limit just as the inability to switch characters without quitting the client is something inherent to game systems. It's an issue that was created due to poor programming, and one that could be fixed by better programming. I know it's possible because *other games can do it*; the amount of data Eve sends at any one time is less than your average large-scale action game. It does this in part because it was designed prior to 2004 when servers were much weaker and bandwidth was lower.
---
It's like I'm arguing that changing to 64 bit is technically possible and you're responding that it's impossible because the client is currently 32 bit. That's not how technical limitations work.

I think everyone at least knows that server goes through downtime every day, considering how often the word appears in official materials. And the game warns you hour before the shutdown.

I'm sure the large majority of people know that downtime is a thing, but I'm also sure that a fair amount of people don't realize when it actually takes place. Especially those who aren't very familiar with that TZ. Also, a few little blips warning about downtime can easily be overlooked. 
---
I don't even run abyssals, I just feel like it would be common sense to not lose shit when it has nothing to do with the game itself.
---
Redacted
---
I read that in a couple "things to know before starting" articles...but the differences between A and O weren't covered. Thank you!
---
I want to run the server
---
Because of the amount of "trolls" in Low Sec. I couldnt even go through a low sec system for a skill book once without getting poped. 
---
Its just not worth my time to attempt it.
---
&gt; product shrinkage.
---
"I WAS IN THE POOL!"
---
vilys small brain isn't able to invade china land so he now instead is trying to get his members the Ferox F1 content in highsec they deserve, what a military mastermind
---
Just going to change out to combat nyx. And make sure i have extra LO. 
---
Bring it
---
8 bling fitted force recons sitting in my wormhole rn just waiting for the update
---
Hoping if I use a Nyx that throws up its own armor links it's not a give away to being bait...
---
&gt; Why is the plex not in a plex vault?
---
Totally forgot that existed.  Probably uses PLEX as often as I do.
---
Better than being snuffed out of an alliance...
---
It's fun dunking their fleets, that's for sure.
---
Haha not me. All the others crying about this blackout. I wonder how many people I’ll see online Friday
---
Test tax plz ignore...
---
What's that doomsday passive module in middle rack?
---
The world makes idiots everyday. So do injectors
---
CCP Falcon in the centre, this is a re-mash of the Pitch Black poster featuring Vin Diesel that I think fits pretty well with the Null local kill coming soon. Here is the original poster [https://i.imgur.com/xeZgiVt.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/xeZgiVt.jpg)
---
Hunting or krabbing recons?
---
The hype is real
---
There’s got to be the people in the game who don’t even have local open
---
im am quitting eve, gona drop million more plexes
---
I think it was available until the 9th.
---
I love how its people who have not played for years "thinking" of resubbing...
---
I can "think" I have a  million dollars does not mean its happening. 
---
Also just waiting for the next module or local transponder we have to put up to get local back....
---
Good point.  Never considered that.
---
Not his lawyer or anything, but I believe the Mittani specifically asked everyone to share information they figure out about the Drifters with any and all for everyone's benefit. He's doing as he is asked.
---
&gt; It’s impossible to make a safe that is outside of dscan from the closet celestial afaik. The game won’t let you initiate warp to it
---
You can make bookmarks outside that right now, and it is very easy, but not convenient.
---
The ban on activating modules was never published.
---
&gt; No restrictions will be made on warping, module activation etc.
---
Broken as intended.
---
Tbf the West Coast USTZ guys should deffo be next on the rota... Watch this space!
---
Ok dad
---
Thats not how a rainy day fund works
---
Few of both. Kinda hoping to get a nice exit to deeper parts of delve or something but anything will do.
---
That feel when you are afraid of the dark more so than the belief that anything is actually out there that wants to hurt you. 
---
It's more dangerous to walk around downtown at night after all.
---
you should think about your elderly aunt or something to calm that boner down and post this in a couple days big guy
---
I could almost put down Tarkov for this.
---
I kept it off spacebar because I have a mechanical keyboard and smashing the spacebar is loud as fuck and the missus gets mad.
---
Just curious as I'm an industrialist, and I like to know which way the meta is blowing.
---
Who wants to make a huge bloat fleet of cyno who will just lit empty beacons all over nullsec to give them an heart attack?
---
Its that natural instinct we all have from when we roamed the forests and the preditors go unseen lurking in the darkness night :D
---
Nice to see ppl dropping supers in lowsec in actual fights again
---
What's the purpose of the 'Doomsday' overlay on many twitch streams? Is it there to hide a specific module of the fit? Or is it purely 'cosmetic'?
---
Pretty sure recon ships are going to be the new meta for a while even though they can be kinda awkward to fit (looking at you rook) or until ccp decides to either nerf the shit out of them or one way or another add local back.
---
Pick a pirate frig that is not the astero and skill into it. Don't skimp on the support skills.
---
Hangout in and around novice and small plexes.
---
So I guess even the drifters are prone to security breaches and data leaks. XD
---
I meant it condescendingly  but I guess the downvotes have spoken.
---
Dude... Weird post... Just man the f up and go low sec!
---
Since you don't seem to understand, let me elaborate. The author of this reddit post is Povar Razbod, his flair would indicate him to be of the Federation Uprising alliance, the alliance I am currently in. However the author is taking part in an action known on reddit as "flair baiting". In which a user uses a flair to indicate that he is part of a group that he is not actually part of in an effort to make people believe erroneous information. 
---
A quick search in game or on zkill would allow a person to see that Povar Razbod, or as he is known in game, PoVar RaZvOd, is not actually a member of Federation Uprising, but rather he is a member of the Wormhole alliance known as DURA LEXX. This is is zkillboard link:  [https://zkillboard.com/character/1499650153/](https://zkillboard.com/character/1499650153/) 
---
In regards to the majority opinion that Federation Uprising members have on the Black Out, I will say that as an actual member of Federation Uprising, we are all ecstatic about these changes as we are an alliance whose main activity is PVP, and of which PVE or other activities are merely used as a means to the end that is PVP content.

CCP can do that too (turn off the ESI endpoints for killmails).
---
It’s almost like their are purpose built T2 haulers of ethos kind of thing. Yes it’s not the drag and drop all that a JF is, but guess what you get to charge more for your goods anyway.
---
the role play would have been better if it were a more general role play, instead of this weird quasi-grr-gons thing
---
Then that’s a totally proportional response!
---
So, how much are you buying killmarks for?
---
Reminds me of my corp's first major w-space fleet encounter.
---
As I'm the paranoid one, I of course was the first (and only) person to notice a Loki appear on d-scan.  We weren't really nervous, as we had at least 8 remote-rep Tengus and a Chimera that could triage (ya, old story).
---
But of course I'm even more paranoid upon spotting the Loki, so bruising my finger pounding the d-scan button 100 times a second.
---
Suddenly, a very large fleet appears on d-scan.  They had more Logis than be had ships, and several Falcons (they obviously were setup just for us).
---
Yell at everyone to bug-out, at which point all but one person realizes they didn't bookmark the wormhole!  The one person that did was the carrier pilot (not me).  Luckily his alt was out off-grid fleet-booster (ya, again, old story) and also had a bookmark.
---
So we were warping around the system until we could get the bookmark, because nobody wanted to sit on the hole.
---
Two Tengu were caught (not me), and everyone else escaped.  Everyone would have escaped if they had bookmarked the hole!
---
Weird part:  attacking fleet didn't park anybody on the hole.
---
You think you do, but you don't
---
Die faq
---
Can we not have a blackout where if you break a rule you get perm banned and muted from modmail? 
---
It's kind of spicy like nullsec without local. Maybe it's all clear, maybe you're about to get dicked.
---
If you'd seen some of the modmails we've had lately you'd understand my vexation..
---
&gt;You can also dock up and they'll never know how many you have until you undock...
---
Pretty much all structures/stations can give you a count of who is docked.
---
Find any Athanor or Tatara you can dock at.
---
Right-click the ore.  Compression is free.
---
NPC stations are not really used anymore for refining.
---
Tip:  You can find great ore in 0.5 hisec systems, if you don't mind 'claim-jumping' a moon asteroid field.  I did this in a Venture on an alt, mining Arkonor, with the owners on the field; they were friendly, and invited my alt to join their corp.  Not every corp will be as welcoming.
