If you're whining about losing a fight in a help newbie forum thread, you might be lol
---
Who's salty? The whole point of the post is basically props to Jump for giving a great fight and not doing the usual boring response.
---
literally the only way we got any kills lmao, til y'all brought that devoter in. Heavy armor is tough to break, and we didn't have mass on the hole to bring any more bhaals/scorps :( but yeah, he was dualboxing Ponti's, he's one of our best boosh pilots. Mort does work lol
---
1) stop giving up easy kills
---

---
2) people stop coming for easy kills
---
3) less shitheads in your space
---
4) eve online: 2019

Ok wormholer

the one lord of lowsec still left
---
It‚Äôs so every potential target is a effectively bait. Gets the trespassers killed and discourages hunting in our space.
---
I did reship both chars, was through a crit hole so basically destroyers were the biggest reinforcements we were getting which worked out nicely for me lol
---
That damn Devoter though, I didn't catch then name but many angry words at them.
---
fair
---
came here to post this so take my upvote
---
Dont repair or it loses its luck
---
God forbid people bring you content
---
which we 100% appreciated, for sure. Good Fight!
---
Honestly I love ratting hauling and mining in that order. I‚Äôve been grinding hauling missions to try and get past the terrible lvl 1 ones, and I have a basic dragon that I rat with when I get bored lol
---
Oh no this is on the same account and I still use my old character as a bank of sorts, I just was fiddlin' with a new character since my old one was all over the place. Only remember doing combat with it and rushing up the Caldari ship lines and ending up with a decked out Raven.
---
sometimes i really really hate wormholers. this post is why.
---
Lol, NC now bragging about killing procurer fleets LMFAO
---
And? One supercap loss and one rorq loss? You seem to think we care :P
---
Time to play the lottery
---
OR, people could take personal responsibility, somewhat, for the health of the game as a whole and make decisions on an alliance and coalition level to foster content and promote pvp instead of denying it. But a lot of people would rather just watch the numbers in their wallet grow and play farmville in space
---
But still not vertical....
---
Lol beat me to it
---
Ok, I'm convinced you're intellectually disabled. With that in mind, let me explain.
---
This thread is about how Koreans are improving numbers on TQ. As you can see, the screenshot was taken around 1420, on the later end of AUTZ. That's why this isn't actually "30% down on last year" as you suggested in your original comment. That's why /u/Cpt_Soban told you to compare it to the 15,000 online players typically on during AUTZ. That's why my rhetorical question about the timezone of Koreans was relevant. 
---
I'm not from the US, so don't take this as an attempt to bring politics into a gaming subreddit, but I'm sure if I look through your post history you'll be posting pro Trump/Republican garbage everywhere. For whatever reason you guys all seem to fit the same mould.
---
You guys held on for quite some time there. Glad to see you leaving for greener pastures.
---
Yup, used to be part of APOC, went inactive, then joined TEST, stared at my super, was bored and went inactive again as an npc corp guy, after months I shrugged and went active again as an industrialist, made new corp, went down to provi and now setting up a big PI chain. There's a good accessible market for everyone and you could even trade resources with the main alliances there as there are quite allot of industrialists among them. 
---
As long as you do not shoot the provi guys they won't shoot back. have a chat with guys from APOC, CVA, etc etc and ask them who you need to +5.
---
dont worry most of your good fcs already took the advice
---
Dude, I was in Venal trying to help build this regional economy.  But PL coming and evicting our venal pocket was my last straw.  I hope this enterprise works out for you but at present I don't see it working with bored megas constantly wrecking people's shit.
---
If you are tanking you are repairing damage faster than you are taking damage. Or you are avoiding damage to the point that you are not going to die soon.
---
Yeah but you do have to do as they say.
---
Rising star of Tribute? Is that like being top of the special ed class?
---
We all have our opinions and I respect yours. Thanks for your wishes and we hope to thrive there!
---
&gt; and by default Triglavian invasion systems have drone debuffs which don't help.
---
OP specified Emerging Conduits though which don't have those. They're just Trig-based anomalies.
---
Highsec tears are best tears, but WH tears are pretty good too.
---
thats one funky colorblind mode
---
Okay, Amuptee. That‚Äôs why ‚Äúhe‚Äôs‚Äù still active, right? And lol, i never messaged anyone. You‚Äôre insane and think way more of yourself than you‚Äôre really worth.
---
How many permabans have you gotten again? üòÇ
---
Like in Homeworld, setting a primary/secondary color for my ships should be great.
---
Wow if only there weren't actual data to out there directly calling you a liar.

http://evemaps.dotlan.net/corp/KarmaFleet
---
THE VERITABLE FLOOD OF APPLICATIONS CAN BARELY BE CONTAINED BETTER MAKE A NEW ....oh shit its basically a flat line ok.
---
content goes 2 ways. if it's a fight for us, it's also a fight for you. And people will keep coming to an extent because a large percentage of imperium krabs are at the bottom of the iq pool, so it's easy frags. That doesn't mean it's not content for you, It's still a potential fight you could participate in, bait fits, scouts on gates, etc. 
---
Letting the miners mine in peace is bad for everyone not goons. I mean, I understand why you all do it, you're terrified of the next eviction of your empire and you're doing everything you possibly can to make it an unattainable goal. One of these things is to hard deny any type of fun any group other than your own could have in your space. The problem that I (and I assume many others) have with this attitude is it completely denies fun for a massive portion of the playerbase, both the people in your space that aren't getting to fight because noone will drop on goons (because they can't with any chance of winning) and the people that would drop that choose not to waste their time because, again, no chance of winning.
---
Denial of content in any area is bad for eve online as a whole. There's a reason less and less people play the game, as more and more people still online come into the nullblocs and simply krab their brains out to eventually quit out of sheer boredom. It's *bad* for Eve Online as a game. And the Imperium is in the lead for causing that damage more than any other group.
---
Returning player from years ago, looking to get into Incursions to spend some time getting back into the swing of things. Have all the skills/fits to do it, but the community seems dead? I haven't found anything online regarding active groups. TVP seems to have no presence outside of their website, as their chat channels all say thanks for the memories.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
So in essence I'm looking for a group to run incursions with. Thanks for your help!
---
I have been cursed out in Russian twice.
---
No, I'm 2.  Don't even tell me if there's more in here because that'd mess me up yo.
---
That's fair I guess.
---
Part of me wishes the scale and number of systems was a bit smaller though.
---
Horde and Brave generally won't, although if you annoy Brave enough they'll drop a HAW dread on you.
---
Be WHer
---
Post one example
---
Is absolute truth, all other examples are lies
---
Run back into WH and roll it
---
Well maybe give it another try? I can get you in on the network which can put you in contact with other groups and players in the area, at the very most it give you a better feel of a community out in these parts.
---
Ha! Love that game - and she is so believable no matter how your choices influence her character arc. Now a big fan of Yvonne Strahovski.
---
The last time I took a 10 man t1 cruiser gang in Brave's space they dropped 2 supers on us. Sounds good, though.
---
I‚Äôm trying, I switched to a more PVP centric corp, killed a Astero from a russian corp the other day, I was really busy so I didn‚Äôt try to talk with them.
---
That guy needed to learn not to fly an Astero without a cloak (you can fly one without, you better know what your doing though), and not warp to planets at zero, made me feel good about my dscan skills though.
---
And we've sat on GE- and other catch gates with a 100 man fleet and they've brought Corms and no caps. Depends on the day.
---
Yes, now it has been enhanced by fines on the corps.
---
Fact. It's all we do. Rorqs out in our home hole 24/7, munching that sweet spod. This was a one of fight, and we only did it because dhsj seeded our hole and said they'd kill all our miners and evict us if we didn't undock and fight :(
---
It'll most likely never happen again, nothing but barge losses on our kb's from here on out, scout's honor.
---
Yeah, I tried that, just couldn't track anything, got pointed by a ceptor, and even after webbing him and hitting approach, with standard loaded. I suppose it'll just take some getting used to, I just got t2 medium lasers and its the first t2 medium turret I've got, so I've never really had to worry about lowering transversal before
---
so basically youll get dropped (on everyone else) regardless of who you go after
---
just wanted to make sure
---
&gt;dude executing those fleets takes a ridiculous level of skill and discipline.
---
ahahahahhaahahha
---
Like I said, welcome to nullsec. I don't get why folks are acting like this is new.
---
&gt; In a couple years when EVE is still going
---
Ah yes, I forgot that as long as 100 people still log on every day "the game is still going"
---
Botting &gt; account hacking but it's still not ok.
---
Also this is a pretty weird but solid effort troll (look at me I fell for a bait post rip) or you're actually trying to gin up pro-rmt propaganda for something. All your other posts are weird shit in /r/libertarian so imma guess the former though
---
People have been begging for this for fucking years
---
idk what's taking CCP so long but I don't like it at all
---
CCP almost never refunds you if you get hacked. Partly this is b/c the hacker will sell your million-plus items and it's hard as fuck for them to track shit down and they don't want to mass-create duplicates since that actually matters in this game's economy (or used to anyway lol#hyperdeflation). It's just not worth them paying someone for 20 hours to unfuck all your shit. 
---
It's also b/c people will sell their account and then the buyer will RMT it, then file a hack ticket in the hope of getting to RMT the same shit twice over.
---
Try 100ab fleet composition VS caps
---
cracks forming ?
---
EVE players have a really distorted sense of skill and are amazed some people can execute a trick in a 1hz tickrate game..
---
Maybe play other games a bit more
---
you don‚Äôt understand i gank in amar but there is 1b ransom to gank in amarr from the idiots.
---
webs in 1.0, got it.
---
Yes, except sometimes for irony (like calling your best friend a cunt).
---
Happy to see Lowsechnaya still active in Aridia
---
Duel yourself/your friend, or have friendly fire turned on (you shouldn't be in corps with people you don't trust anyways).
---
there are about 60 procurers on that br.
---
caldarius alliance only has \~100 active pvp characters.
---
...how?
---
completely ignoring if defenders even work on structure bombs but since they have 4m hp you would need more than 7000 destroyers for them... 
---
so yeah.. gl with that
---
non compete clause test :D
---
Well i find it funny that when panfam loses mining barges they usually tell you that you wasted your time killing those worthless barges but now there is a whole video about it ._.
---
I plan on becoming an industrialist. I was wondering how much processing I can reasonably get to. I know with level 5 Reprocessing + efficency + ore type gives 69%. What other ways are there to increase my return.
---
can you get to the point? your irrelevant chatter is annoying
---
Ishkur and Enyo are hands down the most fun ships in the game.
---
I heard he sunk raft foods though.
---
One thing that's really been amazing learning about EVE these past few months I've been playing is how Reddit seems to consider Goons equally: 
---
\- the best people to farm for kills
---
\- the people killing the game
---
\- a group killing themselves from the inside
---
\- a laughingstock with draconian policies that get people insanely outraged
---
\- trolls
---
\- the ones controlling CCP
---
\- the ones CCP is making all their changes to destroy
---
\- preventing people from experiencing 'content' (fuck I hate seeing people use that word, it's so dumb)
---
\- controlling all of space
---
\- stuck in Delve because of their own incompetence
---
\- etc...
---
Just give your carebears and people who want to stay in goonswarm enough help with finding a new corp.
---
It's always painful to see a corp trying to go elite pvp mode only to lose 60-80% of their people (where a few of then win eve forever)
---
When will we get new model skins?
---
Pride of Higarra Naglfar skin when?
---
You buy plex. which is an easily transferrable in game item.
---
But also just buy it from CCP directly.
---
We were joking about that. You'd have to at least surpass DBRB's loss total or my total titans lost to get kicked. Merkelchen has a long way to go.
---
Nice words by Hilmar, reality does not agree. The real reason can be found here: [https://www.export.gov/article?id=Korea-Foreign-Exchange-Controls](https://www.export.gov/article?id=Korea-Foreign-Exchange-Controls)
---
I play in pcbangs.
---
So I have my profile stuff ona. Flash drive and copy it over every time.
---
It then thinks every notification since I copied that is a new notifcation.
---
I just ignore it.
---
Uhm, you mean leaking and going their own way?
---
A good number of anomalies are described on the eve university wiki: https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Combat_site#Anomalies
---
I don't know which exact anomaly you are talking of. A VNI should be able to run essentially all anomalies if fitted properly and properly run (even after the VNI changes).
---
damage control squad in 
---
3...
---
2...
---
1...
---
Uh we have multiple keepstars
---
Here's a list of all the FCs goons ordered us to kick:
---
Use a hauling service to move them to jita. Otherwise ask the locals. They might be the most interested. Depending on location and bulkiness there is little hope though.
---
&gt; Goons do nothing : get insulted

To be fair they were likely drunk at that point. Looks like this was halfway into this week's Saturday Night Swarm. Every Saturday the Karmafleet dudes go out roaming while drinking heavily and listening to their own DJ. Lots of fun to be had and many great and hilarious [kills](https://zkillboard.com/related/30004805/201908040200/) and [losses](https://zkillboard.com/kill/79461613/) .
---
Also, obligatory [Karmafleet is recruiting](https://youtu.be/dQK5FYIdJco) .
---
About a year or so ago, they 'liquefied' PLEX so that you now need 500 for one month of Omega, but everyone who owned PLEX at the time had each PLEX turn into 500 of the new stuff. So the value stayed the same, it was just easier to trade smaller amounts of it. 
---
What you're seeing is a price of 3.5 *million* ISK: https://evemarketer.com/types/44992 
---
So the cost of a month of Omega currently is `500 * 3.5M = 1.75b`
---
Implying ~~1/3~~ all of the map is not "blue guys"
---
fify
---
&gt;And you wonder why more and more corps are leaving your alliance and moving elsewhere.
---
Those are very few and far inbetween
---
Goons &gt; Quick lets try and get some content to show /r/eve we're having lots of fun: UNDOCK THE JACKDAWS
---
&gt; DBRB's loss total or my total titans lost to get kicked
---
  Did that other guy lose as much before he was kicked?
---
Did someone say Homeworld?  
---
  THIS IS CPT SOBAN OF FLEET FENRIN SHA- LOOKS LIKE YOU GUYS COULD USE A HAND
---
A Kiith wouldn‚Äôt like the imperialist Amarr I think.
---
Wasnt CCP's argument against a skin making tool for players the conservation of the EVE artstyle? This looks like a ship from a spacegame for kids, i.e. Space-Transformers.
---
Can we now all finally agree that structures are dog shit and only good at getting free kills for the people that own them?
---
Light fighters would apply to small shit
---
WTF?  This looks like Claptrap
---
You mean back before everyone good left and CCP wasn't owned by Pearl Abyss?
---
Pls don't :3
---
eve uni wiki
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page
---
The groups that take new players in, give them free stuff, and mentor them killed the game?
---
OK Boomer
---
They surely can't be both the thing that's got a stranglehold on EVE and CCP, destroying everyone in their way and leaving nothing for everyone else to do, AND an incompetent bunch of loser nerds who are just killing their own members out of a useless degree of bureaucracy, their lower ranks flailing around uselessly while their upper ranks rake in Twitch sub money. I once even saw someone say Goons are bad because the leadership forces everyone on the forums to play the game or else. In any case, I'm not saying Reddit itself is some hive mind being hypocritical but I just find it very fascinating that I keep reading such a wildly inconsistent array of beliefs and accusations held about them.
---
Is it safe logged so you can RMT it?

How though? How does someone injecting a rorq affect you?
---
...admittedly it's not the same though, my text has an actual punctuation.
---
I had a dozen office plebs try their passwords in this and every single one of them had been compromised, email and password. 
---
It‚Äôs stunning how shit people are at security and how uncommon identity theft is.
---
Apart from the farms and fields development of eve it effected me personally because my elite PvP allance turned into a defend the rorqual allance
---
I see no problem in both these things being simultaneously true
---
If you don't understand what they did then best not to comment
---
brutal. have an upvote
---
How am I supposed to get that much isk
---
Thanks =)
---
I‚Äôm glad you guys had fun. Also, a lone carrier pilot having the balls to drop in the middle of an enemy fleet is pretty brave. Fair play to the goon carrier pilot for laying his dick on the table.

It‚Äôs so easy to remove It. Not hard at all.

So make one yourself

No shit. Welcome to high class wormhole space.
---
Pitts had fun with that dread drop too....
---
FW mission hubs were blocked by both sides of the warzone so people would stop krabbing them. for the time being the only way to obtain LP and rewards will be plexing and doing PvP. you could do missions in high sec but that's not gonna pay much and will probably make you a target, but that's intentional. FW is supposed to be about the PvP not the PvE. now go and die in glorious flames like God/The Elders intended..
---
did you find him?
---
The real issue is that supers are also the response to normal caps and subcaps
---
Looks like angry birds
---
&gt; This is understandable, but in the end there is a more simple, universal fix. 
---
Apparently you missed the part where the people being hacked are the people who already took no precautions as to secure their account. Its not a universal fix.
---
The universal fix is using a password manager and random unique passwords. The fix is backing that up. The fix is universal because it applies to ALL of your accounts.
---
There is no fix for other people refusing to take even these basic precautions, there is no technical solution to people not caring until after they get bit.
---
2fa exists in 2019
---
So hawt right now
---
Shooting their own citadel might be fine.  It requires an extra person undocked, untethered, and pointed for 20 seconds to activate the defenses.
---
You can even put a 10 or 20 second warning on the activation.
---
Terrible idea
---
This is a case study in why you should have a different password...
---
Oh, and 2FA for your email too. Most offer that nowadays.
---
True, but that's much less likely if you don't share passwords between accounts.
---
He wasn't drunk enough.
---
I'd rather have eve 2 (POE style)   exact same game, same everything - just brand new engine, graphics, etc.
---
I do about 500mil per month per toon. Being lazy with 3 day laser cycles and hauling once per week. Just doing robotics.
---
Twitch saves the VODS, so you can watch them on twitch :)
---
He's not in PL
---
ccp.round() strikes again
---
Where you running your operation? Wh planet yields are high
---
If a hacker also has access to your original email account, as well as your Eve account, it's probably because you were commiting the #1 sin of password security, sharing passwords.
---
Also, if you have 2FA for Eve, you should probably have 2FA turned on for your email too. :)
---
They don't really count as people though.
---
I had the exact same concern when I started 2-3 years ago. You‚Äôll learn quickly that having more isk and more expensive ships isn‚Äôt an automatic win. A lot of eve is about teamwork. Good communication and basic intelligence can easily make up for time in the game. Just make sure you find the right group to help you get up to speed
---
There is a special place on my watchlist for bitches like you you are done son
---
But did he though?
---
Shhhh, trust the narrative
---
Very nice AP - worth the wait
---
Maybe I'm just not efficient at timing the server ticks, but I find that moving the mouse and clicking provides the right delay that allows the module to activate properly. Sometimes when I use keyboard shortcuts it doesn't take, and then I'm worse off because the UI doesn't give a really solid indicator whether the mod has activated or not, and I'm like, "Is it pulsing green? I think so. Maybe. Oh crap it's not!" And meanwhile like 3 ticks have gone by.
---
Anyone who can explain to me why I struggle with this or what I should be doing better, please let me know!
---
Yeeee but olemca has done a lot over the years, solo and with corps and even with all the shit thrown at him he still managed to get enough votes to make CSM.
---
Whereas you seem like someone who had their shit pushed in a while back and are still struggling to get it out, and to vent the frustration, have taken to reddit where you seem to think you‚Äôre edgy, but just get boring to read posts from tbh, it was funny at first but then I realised the extent to which you try so hard to be noticed here and now I just feel sorry for you üôÅ
---
I don't see a single one of those claims that are contradictory in any way shape or form. Your comment confuses me....if anything, each one of those traits individually listed makes it more likely for them to have the other traits listed.
---
Your argument is *supporting* the idea that Goonswarm is every one of those things you listed, not fighting against it.
---
I just checked. Yes, yes it is.
---
Navy Caracal: haven't tried it so I'm gonna hold my breath here.
---
Corax, excellent doctrine for smalls, higher alpha than corms.
---
Griffin Navy Issue: essentially a slightly worse hookbill with much better engageability. Excellent slot layout allows for plenty range control to make up for it's speed, ehp is excellent, great surprise for novice plexes.
---
Nighthawk: okay this one you can make a point for being actually awful. But even the Nighthawk has it's niche in pulsar doctrines, capable of sporting 120k EHP on a fully passive tank at about 82% average resist (with an ewar mid to boot).
---
Yo sick song choice. Loved it in warframe.
---
But it wasn't a rebuttal at all...if anything, it shows that many people hold different ideas on Goonswarm that contribute to each other, creating a picture of even more solid evidence.
---
Ok Boomer

im 15

i didnt know they had 3d printers in australia
---
Being public facing, somehow especially in video games, can come a tremendous cost.

Its not too late to start playing at all. Look up youtube guides to get started and prepare to spend some time learning how to play. The reward will pay off after you get through the learning curve.

They didn't bother to finish them off because they didn't think they'd rebound, much less rebound to the extent that they'd once again be at the very top, while making the same cancerous and toxic mistakes as before.

The coalition against them didn't 'collapse and turn into a dumpster', it just disbanded after the punitive war was seen as a success. IE; The IRL Sixth Coalition, or EVE's (original) DRF. Like an actual coalition.

Nobody wanted to replace a megablock that stagnated the game with another megablock that stagnated the game.

Crazy talk

And the Fort is down.  Glad we can help you win EVE.
---
Are you in one of the starter corporations, or did you join a player-run corporation?
---
If they're literally camping your undock then I suspect that you joined one of the small (shitty) high security space corporations that got themselves "wardecced" by pirates. We lose a lot of people to joining these dipshit high sec corps who don't know how to defend themselves and get preyed on by pirates using the war declaration (wardec) system.
---
If I'm right, you'll want to quit the corporation and go move somewhere else. Take a look at the new player corps I mention in my other comment. I tried to give a relatively broad list of them, including several who are enemies with each other (and even included enemies of my own alliance). Talk to one of their recruiters, they'll give you more personalized advice on how to get out of your situation.

Works for everyone I posted to, is there an error message or just a blank screen? I can check out my YouTube side to see if it's flagged or something.

Takes a special kind of loser to drop a fax to save an oracle from losing a 1v1.  Good to see it punished =)

this dude had 2FA

They sure as hell didn't strive, besides Pandemic Horde that is the only entity in the north capable of progress.
---
After TEST chased goons south, panfam rewarded them with an eviction and thus the war to kill goons turned out to have little to no effect on goons and gave TEST a reason to hate goons less than panfam.

Their 2fa sucks because you can always get around it by sending an email instead of using the crypto token.  The vast majority of hacked accounts are hacked emails so it straight up doesn‚Äôt work at all in that scenario.
---
To be honest you can get a basic idea of what they're saying with Google translate (I've been using it on twitch streams to help some Korean newbros). It's far from perfect but it does allow for a rudimentary level of communication
---
Come join us; lots to learn and it is fun.
---
You do have maybe a "someone" that rages and quits comms when a corp member sticks Inner Hell tags on their ship to spook them. Hmmmmmmmmm?
---
Oh
---
The answer here is to just pay for the sub or play as alpha. Don‚Äôt make eve a job grinding for plex.
---
This is my strong preference. I think, if it's handled well, a high risk / high reward model could be a big win for both PVE and PVP players.
---
Sure, blackout dramatically increases the danger in undocking and doing PVE activities. More miners and ratters blow up, which creates more demand for people who build those ships or farm the loyalty points. At the same time, the rewards for undocking and risking death should *also* see a commensurate increase to balance it out. I think that's what CCP fucked up with the blackout experiment, the rewards weren't even close to worth the risk.
---
Personally, I'd like to see it happen by moving away from anomalies and toward moons and escalation sites, which encourage the PVE'ers to spread out and move around more. Preferably with an inverse relationship to ADMs, so that the more a system is farmed the less escalations spawn there. Not only does this make more systems active but it also has a defensive benefit for the PVE'ers, who are no longer concentrated in a handful of specific systems like fish in a barrel. Leave the anoms for people using capitals and supers -- which I think is still valuable gameplay because it gives us something to hunt other than Rorquals.
---
Do we know how many new players Korea will provide?

This. 10 years ago was when they introduced wormholes.

Contributing to steady online characters count throughout the day. Not just spikes at around 19ET, that we used to have in the past. &lt;3

Just stop being not bright and look at 2 weeks, 1 month or 10 years ago. The same pattern will occur - the peak always lasts for like half an hour, wheras for the first time we see almost a flat line since 12 ET to 18ET. I dare you to find me such patter at any point in time

Your 'Eve is dead' narrative won't sound more plausible when you talk nonsense like that.

&gt;catch up skill point wise

Perhaps if you would read the rest of the sentence , you wouldn't look like a windowlicker
