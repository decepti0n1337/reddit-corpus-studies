This is another one of those times when ccp should ignore reddit. Which is also all of the times.
---

---
We used to play a game when I was a kid called knock down ginger. As a child it was hilarious but with the benefit of hindsight and a doorbell to call my own I can confirm that it was in fact bullshit.
---
---
---
People dont underestimate the CAs it's the opposite as time sure most estimate the insane price and go meh I'll gimp the ship a little instead.
---
I dont understand why you choose this title or why you uploaded this but...ok.
---
Yes but I made a page here at [http://2kjl3h2khhkjf2kfk2f3lfjkhluivhsdohof2.angelfire.com](http://2kjl3h2khhkjf2kfk2f3lfjkhluivhsdohof2.angelfire.com) it's free and it took me like 15 minutes to make.
---
We did it reddit!
---
&gt;I really don't know where you get these ideas from and how you're still playing this game with such naivety. 
---
You mean like wardecs, links, and command broadcasting. The shit that was once in the game, but is no longer or is illegal because it was always shit.
---
Ganking as you know it is probably next, but we are apparently on "CCP's schedule" so it takes a few years of abuse.
---
&gt;If anything, EVE Players prove that adaptation is the key to success.
---
What a joke. Every time CCP steps in, it's because there is no fucking "adaptation".
---
&gt;Whenever a change/new content is implemented, players will have to adapt. 
---
So move gankers to lowsec. Then they can "adapt". You want other players to adapt while you sit there taking zero risk. Typical dishonest trash.
---
&gt;And the mechanics are neither broken nor abusive. They are permitted and even endorsed.
---
Zero risk. No counterplay. No consequences. Links were claimed to not be broken because "just bring your own". Proven dumb.
---
&gt;Like I said, CCP doesn't consider ganking problematic. 
---
Oh, really? You speaking for CCP now? What's your dev name?
---
&gt;If you undock, you consent to PVP and that includes the possibility of getting ganked. If you want 0 risk, go play something else. EVE isn't for you.
---
Absolutely false.
---
&gt;All I can say is I'm happy with how things are and a lot of players in this thread share this sentiment. So keep spilling salt and feed the gankers with your tears. It's what drives them!
---
Of course, you like zero risk and no consequences. Abusers said the same thing about everything they abused. Never been ganked in 10+ years.
---
Secure comtainer?
---
It isn't
---
Well, the first two words of your statement are right.
---
Ok
---
Well I can’t give you any Corp names, as I’m an industrialist , but honestly, goons? Or one of their offshoots. Alternatively if you don’t find anything u like (you probably will)  if you’d be interested in flying some ratting missions escorting a mining fleet/mineral convoy, shoot me a pm, and I’ll see if I can set something up over the coming weeks
---
3 hours is 1 bridge.
---
Ah okay. Some dude in Venal is trying to make a hub and I think I’ll set my sights on there as a start. Thanks!
---
Great, I wish you luck!
---
I saw It would need cloaky alt for scout, many safe spots on mission systems, 200km bookmarks from gates, and so on. My concern is, is it gonna too expensive for cerberus to run lv4 mission and is cerberus fast enoughas tengu to escape from gankers? Im also thinking about taking one high slot to cloak.
---
Or get real corp management mechanics. Those two don't need to be tied together.
---
In the end the point is ccp moved them before and shouldn't be wasting players time.
---
Literally every single one of those ganks would've gone exactly the same way had the Kitsune stayed home
---
Unless you have a scout alt or a friend watching the trace, but who does that?
---
He is stupid for getting out of the abyss? Docking/undocking in Jita is stupid? So the game should basically provide gankers with a never ending stream of on-demand zero risk no consequence max reward income.
---
Using this logic, there can essentially never be a scenario where ganking has imbalanced risk vs reward. Convenient.
---
From what squizz say, only zkillboard cost him too much money per month since recently he was making a monthly post about how much it ruined him to run it
---
The code for zkill is publicly available. If you don’t like the ads and it’s that easy to run, just host your own killboard
---
I'm sure with all the random nonsensical fits floating around, someone accidentally stumbled into one in the past.
---

---
All I can do is laugh at this, well played. Good to see slyce kicking the shit out of bots and the aptly named deadco.
---
Better yet, make it a soft cap and give the ship minor buffs or unlimited penalties based on excesses or deficits in fitting.
---
Hull classes are the main things that need to be differentiated, and that can be sustained by putting stacking penalties on the fittings rigs, or by making them fixed amounts.
---
Fitting skills might as well no longer affect base ship stats, but simply reduce the associated penalties from going over.
---
&gt; Im also thinking about taking one high slot to cloak.
---
The lockon penalty is still a thing with cloaks on non-bonused ships through, right?
---
That would be a massive penalty to your survivability; reaction time to shoot back at players and getting that first volley off at NPCs. Not to mention the one less launcher you'd have fit (impacting DPS and thus mission clear time).
---
everything not F1 monkey
---
Just curious because I don't understand whats keeping you from attacking one then. Like TEST and Goons, technically "blue" on a galactic SOV scale but we keep bashing each others skulls in.
---
Just because you don't want to grind Delves 45 or 46 Keepstars *(lost track)* whats keeping you from camping the space and shitting on crabs? You don't like to grind structures but why does that lead to being "blue"; imo being"blue" is being best buttbuddys so you superduper like each other and are bros. TEST and Goons are not "blue" - best you get is that we ignore each other while whipping panfams ass around the donut that is nullsec.
---
Why do you need that incentive to burn each others space? Who gives a fuck about those sandcastles I wanna shoot people not structures.
---
no brain pvp)
---
Tikle or vdd
---
Thank you
---
Goons literally don’t have CTAs that are mandatory, and you’ve certainly never helped kill a titan or super in any meaningful way but go off, king
---
Why not Null?
---
Third dino post of the day &gt;:I
---
Not sure if rorqual alts and bots count as players but sure
---
Sooo, what kind of consequences do you think they should have?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
My explanation of risk vs reward is as follows: If you are able to destroy a 100 billion ship in a 10 million ship you're an ace and deserved every bit of that kill/loot.
---
If that required alot of effort or no effort at all it doesn't matter to me.
---
If something requires no effort to do and earns alot of money a lot of people will do it thus making it less profitable in the long run because of supply/demand.
---
Ship balancing however is kind of in a weird position within EVE, it sucks that ships that have to do PVE minmax in PVE fits where they stand no chance in a PVP situation, but if you only fit a tiny bit more pvp related mods your chances of survival increases alot, but it also decreases your pay-out, what I see everywhere in this game is that people are dumb and go for the riskiest method to earn isk while having no idea what they are doing and end up paying dearly for it.
---
Sucks! That's eve, happened to me too plenty of times even!
---
But what you also see on the other hand of the spectrum from people that have learned is full brick tanked orcas that will never see a gank in the light of day because it's never worth ganking that kind of ship, even with hundreds of catalysts or a few tornados.
---
We can all go on about risk versus reward and how it shouldn't work this way but I've yet to see any valid point coming from you to address this without completely changing the game at all, in fact i'm starting to question if something like Elite Dangerous/World of Warcraft is more a game for you.
---
Simple Farmers are eve onlines premier AUTZ alliance. The buy in price is high, but the content is 420% higher than tikle or vdd.
---
Gankers lose ships but more importantly sec status that you have to pay back for and you also get fucked by killrights.
---
Oh well yes, as I did say it goes from one extreme to another. So they arent changing anything about jbs or the ability to have any defense, the hp of structures was intentionally set weak because they were able to be defended.  It is almost like the still continue not to have a plan about anything and just change for change sake. But we shall see. Just dont see the point for these structures to be up or why anyone would use a cyno beacon anymore. Bridges I suppose are useful still bit it's all relative as well. 
---
We shall see what they do next I suppose.
---
&gt;2mil combined Shield/Armour hps
---
1. Means nothing with damage caps.  2 million EHP is still ages to kill if it has a damage cap of 500dps
---
2. That's the base, it's increased to 7.5 million EHP for combined armor/shield when turned online.
---
&gt;immediate offline for up to 25 hours after initial 6.6 minute RF
---
It's a 20 minute RF timer.  10 minutes for 3 million raw HP at 5,000 dps cap, for both shield and armor.  It doesn't matter if you've got two leshaks shooting it or 3 supers.
---
And with the JBs having no fatigue, calling people from across your space to converge is a hell of a lot easier than ever before.
---
&gt;removed repairing
---
If you interrupt the attackers during their 20 minutes RF, after 15 minutes it's back to full health, job done.  It doesn't matter how close it's gotten down, it's 15 minutes and it's back to full.
---
An exequror reps at just under 210 raw armor/s.  15m armor takes 10 Exequrors 2 hours to repair.  
---
A 4 rep Guardian reps at 340 raw armor/s.  15m armor takes 10 Guardians 1 hour 13 minutes to repair.  
---
A 3 rep Ninazu reps 5,130 raw armor/s.  15m armor takes 3 Ninazu 16 minutes to repair.
---
&gt;It's worth remembering why CCP made these structures so weak in the first place compared to their predecessors.
---
Weak?  The Ansiblex is much more powerful for traveling than the previous JB.  A ship can't be prevented from jumping through it, it doesn't cause jump fatigue, gives you a cloak on jump in on a gate the size of a regional gate (25km.  Normal gate is 15km, and the old JB was something like 5km).
---
Having them also in range of keepstar/fort is ludicrous.
---
All those blues...
---
So is this why you muted my thread u/Jibrish ?
---
*the bags are filled with Fortizars and Sotiyos*
---
Happy Halloween
---
im looking for a mediocre (at best) killboard, about as much as im looking for a salad, with light salad dressing.
---
Both are still super powerful even without a structure defennding them.
---
light is just too slow and space is just too big
---
A Cerb should be even faster than a Tengu. That's not the problem. The problem is gates. Someone who wants to catch you will park two Sabres cloaked, one on either side of the gate. When you jump through, the bubbles go up, and the cavalry enters warp. You've got seconds to burn out of the bubble before long webs/points land on field and you're hosed. In a rapid light Cerb, you might well be able to nuke tackle and escape. In a HAM or HM Cerb, you're going to have some trouble applying to small tackle ships or even the Sabres.
---
A Tengu can do the system-to-system travel cloaky and nullified, neigh-uncatchable. Someone who's truly dedicated could litter the gate with drones and try to point you if you spawn on top of one and can't cloak, but even then you can use your 200km bookmark to check the in-gate for a drone cloud safely, and crash the out-gate if you get decloaked (since you know the in-gate is clear).
---
:(
---
positivity week is active
---
I'd prefer if we didn't invent a new module that can only be fit to one or two ship classes every time we wanted to solve a problem involving those ship classes.
---
Good deal bro. Maybe I over reacted.
---
yes
---
&gt;If CCP considered ganking a problem, they would have implemented a fix years ago.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Really? Is that why it took 15 years to "fix" wardecs? Something being in the game means NOTHING in terms of good/bad.  
---
&gt;Address that. Admit it means NOTHING in terms of balance if something is still in the game.
---
When did WarDecs get "fixed"? They're still in the game, they merely implemented a counter-mechanic after PIRAT Decced half of New Eden just like that. So what's to address here? It's in the game, so CCP considers it balanced. They even nerfed it a little by making it that gankers don't get insurance payouts when getting their ships destroyed by Concord.
---
&gt;Why should known gankers be able to sit on undock of a "high security" station and suffer no consequences?
---
Why shouldn't they? Docking rights are not tied to Security Status.
---
Even if CCP implemented a change which would require a minimal Security Status to be able to dock in High-Sec NPC Stations, gankers would still be able to dock and tether at public Citadels.
---
&gt;I totally get why people petition it. There is no part of the game I can think of that offers a similar level of zero risk and massive reward as you cherry pick your targets while being protected by concord.
---
It's not zero risk, you can go hours without finding a ship worth ganking (because most players actually have brains). You'll also have to factor in cost of the ships you will lose to Concord for the gank into the equation as well as the cost for security tags to make sure you can get back into High-Sec.
---
And the "massive reward" only come because brainless monkeys like you actually fill your papertanked ships to the brim with expensive sh\*t. Then you get blown up and go all \*surprised Pikachu face\* and expect CCP to compensate you for your lack of intelligence.
---
The gankers show actual effort and get rewarded for it. You refuse to show effort and whine about the results. Boohoo! Keep crying.
---
I'll quickly restate what I said earlier somewhere in this thread. EVE is a sandbox. Anything is allowed, as long as it's not against the EULA. That means lying, scamming, backstabbing, ganking, stealing your loot, ninja-salvaging etc.
---
EVE is a sandbox that includes the bullies that destroy your little sandcastle and laugh at you. Go cry a little louder, maybe they'll stuff your face with some more sand to make you shut up.
---
I personally enjoy the salt you give me here, so keep it coming ;)

Would you pay more to him for it?
---
That is the beauty of ACLs. It’s fairly trivial to isolate their roles to just jump gates or even specific gates.
---
I thought the point was that even costructive criticism is/was getting assblasted. But I dunno, I've never interacted with TiS in any form besides scrolling past.

&gt;TiS isn't a bastion of free speech when that speech includes is stuff we disagree with

I've never understood the whole skin concept in a game like Eve - you are looking at 10x10 pix ship icons 99% of the time anyway :)

ah, so warp 10 was the meguffin of that series "if this, then chaos and bad"

Hell yes!  Good on ya.  I haven't done my kill a supercarrier for kids thing in a few years (though I still have one for that purpose, it's just a pain to coordinate the event without GM help), but I'm playing my own marathon and hosting a giant Extra Life party at my place.  Good luck with it!

I used to be in a decent alliance before they went up and joined Deadco. Had a good time before. Everything went downhill afterwards. In the meantime RR were our neighbors and it was depressing to even pass through their systems. Almost zero activity. Add to that the lack of active defense in my alliance and I left soon afterwards. 
---
Anyway, good job Slycebros for kicking RR. Impressed.
---
C0NE is the best, these guys are having a lot of fun in eve right now.

Imagine hauling? Warp directly from jita 4.4 to your end disto 😅😅 might take a while. But possible.
---
Downvoted for not being proper shitposting
---
I've always wondered how ships in warp are perceived by people "on the ground".  Are people sitting around the table having their morning coffee with part of a ghost titan flying through the dining room?
---
I always preferred CCP Rapier anyway.

---
Someone fill me in I’m out of the loop. My initial assumption is people are Tin foiling over Falcons absence or lack or involvement and are pointing at things like his reaction at the black out ending announcement as evidence he’s being pushed out or M.I.A?
---
Aha, thank you so much, this was precisely what I was thinking of! I'll edit my post and give you thanks for finding it. :)
---
Why?
---
I love this talk. So much effort into creating the science for EVE's watery physics.
---
hahahahhahaha
---
thats the real price of the items. dont fake zkillboard. get better
---
Yeah same I'm like a year late to all of this. Can't believe they removed that lol
---
Finds some Devs and make a better than Eve copy and some clever way to leverage Eve APIs to move all player assets to the new game
---
coz its no bug. thats a value of the item =)
---
you are dumb
---
Yeah, this reminded me of your events.  I got nostalgic and went and watched your twitch vid from the 2015 event.  Lul'd a lil when I saw half the names visible in the fleet window are either Darius, me, or one of our alts.  Miss you bb, hope things are good.
---
Fuck CCP! 
---
Falcon is the reason I play Eve. If they give him the boot I am going to unsub my 107+ accounts and will do everything I can to convince others do the same with all my wealth and power until CCP makes a public apology and reverses what they did to him within reason and up to offering their necks in prostration..
---
I kind of hope this is in joke, but in case it is not... Are people really panicking over someone not being publicly visible on the internet for a little while? Are people really surprised that them asking a question about/to a person's work on a literal holiday and not having a response the day after (on a weekend) gets no reply yet?
---
CCP falcon happens to be a human being, he can have holidays off, he can take vacation, he is not bound to the whims of random people who need his presence at a moment's notice.
---
If you want to find out what he might be up to, ask your question and actually be patient for a reasonable time. Waiting for a person to answer work related things after at least some business hours have passed since your question should be a minimum.
