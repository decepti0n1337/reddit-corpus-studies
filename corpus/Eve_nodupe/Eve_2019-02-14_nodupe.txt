It was so great to die on your first jump into null repeatedly.

the way they have been running the game into the ground lately it might not be here when they decide to try and come back.

Baited on a click bait title.

All im asking is to give ANY reason for the Arbitrator and Bellicose to EVER BE FLOWN and perform well.

I can tell you that the poor sods that still have structures aren't to happy, but I am seeing less and less noob corps with structures.

I approve of this message.

Do hey say that anywhere? I just looked through their entire post + Falcon’s response and I didn’t see that anywhere. 
---
Just out of curiosity, did you get stuck in one of the asteroids ? There is one room where there is a big ass asteroid right by the spawn point, I got stuck in it like 3 times now, stuck in the texture / model. Can't get out of it or shoot anything through it. All I could do is immediately unplug my router and hope the mobs don't kill me by the time I get back in. When you come back into it it warps you back into a different spot in the room.

I really enjoyed watching the tournament. I hope they bring it back.
---
Search is your friend.
---
This has been covered not only here, but on Twitter and on the main site. There was even an emergency fix yesterday because you could not see them unless on grid and could not warp to them either.
---
So yeah, old news.
---
K some questions are stupid.
---
There lies the problems...
---
As a new player in 2014 the AT and the commentating were hugely fascinating, even if I barely understood what was going on. Watching last year’s matches was a ton of fun, even if MC’s team never really materialized. We did have a lot of fun practicing though!
---
Flying as a member of an AT team is still an Eve goal of mine. The dedication required to just participate as a player is nuts though. I can’t imagine how much work went into developing it as a passion project, from the devs, the community team, and the players like you that spent so much time working on it.
---
But yeah, I can see it being tough to justify focusing on with everything else going on. Especially since it obviously doesn’t result in immediate revenue, which makes it extra tough to justify. I’d rather see them be up front about it early, like this, than have a hugely sub-par event.
---
I woke up last night from a nightmare that I was mining in my rorqual capital class vessel and I got tackled by TISHU. I don’t know why my NEAR2 didn’t alert me to alt tab from my rigorous Trap Fap Session. 
---
Instead of having Opus Congelatio and Lex Arson drooping on me, I was met on grid by a lone pilot named ACT Mack-PVT who instantly sent me a chat. He informed me that there were 15 other supers on standby but he was being sent as an emissary of peaceful altercations and gave me a few options. 
---
1) I could get on their Teamspeak server and be locked in a chat room with just Mr. ACT Mack himself to have a back and forth discussion about his opinions of Donald Trump and why he would graciously be the bottom in their love affair. 
---
2) I could log onto my market alt and buy enough reactive gas to total 1.488 billion and contract it to CCP Falcon. 
---
3) or I could say no to their choices and be dropped on. 
---
I chose option one. I was strong I thought. I got into the teamspeak room with the TISHU emissary. We exchanged our pleasantries. He said “Good evening *snicker* my fellow-“ and cut short to hop into another channel and tell Lex Arson about how he was about to BTFO me and then put it in his character’s bio in game. However, in his euphoria he forgot he had changed his PTT key to whisper me in the heat of the moment. He then hopped back down and continued. 
---
The conversation was cut short when he mentioned The Wall and “beaners” however, even though he has never seen a person of Latino descent.  Instead of sitting through this drivel I Alt+F4’d every window I had up and went to go continue my Trap Fap Session elsewhere. I couldn’t take it anymore. He was frothing at the mouth and the spaghetti that was falling out of his pockets was Ragu’s new flavor: *Meat sauce with a hearty serving of Autism.*
---
The next morning when I logged back in however, my ship was still there! Amazing! I still see him in local however. Then I notice he is actually on grid! In a moment of panic, I cloak my rorqual! Then I see him burn towards me. 150km... 100... 50... 15... and then it started increasing. He missed! How retarded can one be? Thankfully, I had my krab issued copy of OBS installed and was able to record this. When he finally gave up, I forwarded a video to this interaction of sheer retardness/autism to Admiral Lex “Shut the fuck up Mack” Arson. Within minutes of receiving this exposing video, I noticed ACT Mack PvT was now a proud member of Deep Core Mining Inc. 
---
Alas, *ironic justice* had been swiftly applied. 
---
If it was a fix then I wouldn't have had to re-add it where it once was added.
---
It's greatly appreciated.
---
Right cause you were totally gana be in the at
---
You didn't even read what I wrote did you. They don't need any "bug plans", the storyline has been exactly what I wrote, they make big new features, announce, don't deliver in time, receive hate, all while NOT delivering on the upkeep this game needs.
---
  
---
What do many of those "thousands" of voices have been specifically asking for is improving upon what is already there. You don't need "big plans" to give an update pass, improve some shit, and release patch notes or a devblog with the details.
---
Why tackle on a ratting fit though if no adc?
---
I get you guys are super salty about losing this war but maybe instead of fighting on reddit try to show some balls ingame.
---
So far all you accomplished is circlejerking a few fake reddit victories with your 20 man vs 2000 propaganda. In reality, even with all your spies, headshots, counter doctrines or upshipping and fighting faction battleships+faxes+titans vs feroxes you keep eating shit vs casual eve players.
---
Show some balls and try to actually accomplish something in game.
---
Probably won't happen. Probably you will again just run away saying "game is shit".
---
I was once. Never say never. And it has nothing to do with my participation.
---
BOOM hi Logibro we miss you
---
Where can prospective tournament pilots play in player run tournament matches? I'm very interested in some sort of organized play, but it seems difficult to find anything of the sort without hoping you notice it on Reddit 
---
Crowfall is potentially the closest to EVE
---
&lt;3 I wish ccp cared as much as the employees involved in organizing these events
---
CCPA will probably chop it down and sell the materials.  Any $$ is free $$!
---
I miss you guys too.
---
Definitely not a bug - there's a huge amount of building up going on right now, leading to something between the Drifters and Triglavians - the world tour may be called called "[Invasion](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/1XdOPP1NO1t0YWM2fY0AUT/fd6aaf4ed99454a9be466461da7e15d9/world-tour-hero.jpg)" for a good reason
---
https://www.eveonline.com/now/world-tour-2019

Wait.. no Fanfest or alliance tournament this year? Anyone have a source?
---
good luck running it
---
Volunteers don't officially represent the company and are therefore a risk. What if one of them said something that angered social media or didn't align to company ethics?
---
How's that *shitting* at all? You sound like any other apoplectic nerd going berserk over something totally pointless
---
it sure reads that way :)
---
Then either fit a cap booster in your mid slots or use a ship bonuses for autocannons, like a Rifter
---
So go have live meet ups. Go to eve Vegas. Stop the reeee brigade ffs
---
Check out deadly boss mods for WoW
---
That's a passion project for 1 guy, blizzard tunes their encounters based on the fact that this exists.... 
---
I mean, maybe it's just me but I think it could be really interesting to have an almost starcraft like system in eve where you start with everyone mining and then producing ships with those minerals (would require dramatically decreased build times/maybe decreased costs ). Having to make choices between whether to keep mining or defense/offense over the course of 10-20 minutes would actually be a show that I'd thoroughly enjoy watching. 
---
Yes it has actually- everyone but /eve of having fun in eve
---
yeah that's the fit i use, if you have cap problems you can replace a drone damage amp for a flux coil or bling out the cap battery with a thukker in the mid, when i first started running the fit i ran with two 3% implants that help cap, also remember your not running the tractor beam so turning that off might help with the cap a bit too.
---
My best memories in EVE. Thanks for leading us to glory you magnificent bastard. 
---
less than 1% of the game's population participated in fanfest or alliance tournament, quit your bitching folks

Wait, wtf happened to the alliance tournament?
---
tbh, CCP didn't need PA to fuck shit up.
---
Protheans held on for what looked like forever. A well earned stay indeed. Hope more things like that can happen around the cluster.
---
When you're so shit at blobbing you have to have tapi deploy all their supers and titans in range so your 500 people can win entosis you get a bit bitter. 
---
It's really the timers that are annoying the most. The amount of time it takes to remove every structure is so tedious.
---
I’ve never watched or been to either, and the community is a shitshow.  
---
A minor point, but the cyno character wasn't named titan escalation in the Hawks feed, it was the titan itself. https://zkillboard.com/kill/75113610/
---
Isn't the fanfest just going mobile and not staying in Iceland? Isn't that the point of the world tour, a mobile fanfest? Or am I mistaken?
---
I really don't give a shit about the AT though. I know some of the previous winners. They are a clusterfuck clique of impressive proportions and don't reflect the playerbase as a whole anyway. 
---
didnt you get the memo? greed is good 
---
oh my dear summer child....
---
It should be. 
---
If we all sit around waiting for CCP to fix everything and create fun things to do, we're all going to die of old age. That's not what they're good at, and we've been coming up with things to do in this game despite of CCP instead of because of them for years.
---
You keep subscribing because you like to play the game and the game is fun. If it's not fun, sitting around and waiting for CCP to make it fun is literally never going to happen. 
---
To be clear, I don't like this decision either. But if folks sit around waiting for CCP to drop content into your laps, of course you're going to be disappointed. Nothing they've created has been as compelling or fun as the stuff we create ourselves. 
---
Would have stayed if it were a shield super.
---
This was my world cup. fuck you PA, unsubbed.
---
I like having BPCs for accelerators. It gives some extra value to industry. What I don't like is that BPC requiring special ingredients that take ages to mine.
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/pmkcyv/february-release-cynosural-field-overview-changes
---
It was already announced what was happening
---
You are right! Ah shit that is funny. When I initially looked at this via the zkill related it had a cyno malediction on the zkill br. Upon further review there was a malediction with a cyno inside the titan. Ah shucks there goes a good joke. Thanks for pointing it out though. 
---
There's nothing else why do you think Eve has lasted this long.
---
I don't understand a word of what you said.  It does not compute.  (and I would not believe it even if it were true)
---
Thanks for doing these write up's! 
---
This.  Honestly, 1000% this.  BenadrylPeppers for CSM!
---
No, it wouldn't.
---
The hate is directed at the management, who aren't trying.
---
They did mention last summer or fall that the venue was booked through fanfest.  I don't remember where I heard that though.
---
You're Logibro!? I miss you :( 
---
It's pretty stupid for a MMO which pvp is the best part to cancel a tourney where there are the best pvp players.  Bad call CCP, bad call.
---
You could be on the right track with this. Another user suggested something similar recently [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/alc8i7/injectors\_capitals\_rorquals\_citadels\_balance\_ideas/efcuwt0](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/alc8i7/injectors_capitals_rorquals_citadels_balance_ideas/efcuwt0)
---
When I quit in 2012, people were saying the same stuff.
---
To salvage in T4 mission systems you need to combat probe down the mission runners to get into their complexes. Once you are in quickly bookmark a wreck in each room because the gates will despawn when the mission runner turns in the mission.
---
You got a link to the original OP, I like this format.
---
I already won at EVE years ago, so I had kind of been rolling my eyes at all the "EVE is dying" drama around here lately and not taking it very seriously. "People are just upset because it's been bought by a new company, but people are always whining about something or other, I'm sure it's not actually that bad..."
---
Now I see that I was truly mistaken. They're killing off the Alliance Tournament? Wow. Just wow. People were right. EVE is dead. RIP in pieces.
---
Unsub, come back.  It's what we do.  We love Eve and we love to hate Eve. We see the potential and what could be, but settle for what is.  
---
Even playing what is, is still better than 95% of the games out there.  Shit should have been bigger than WOW, but here we are.
---
This was very interesting and logical, thank you. Now go back to where you came from, this is r/Eve
---
I care
---
This badly needs to be iterated on, but is the change that makes it possible to make the ECM ships good again.

In what world did anyone fight over truesec and ore? Why are so many people completely unaware of when the core mechanics of ihubs were introduced?

9 subs cancelled. Reasons stated. 
---
I'd follow EVE NT on whatever media you want, I'm not able to say for certain that we will have an event this year but we will certainly do something between now and the next AT in terms of competitive EVE play.  
---
I hope not, but not gonna lie I'd be super smug
---
no, i'm just cutting onions..
---
i think people would be a lot less angry if there was actually some balancing plans put out. at the moment people all feel like AT is gone and ccp will do some shitty 5 minute number tweaking/changing a few stats balance in a few months.
---
i think if at the same time CCP said AT wasn't happening this year, they also put out a nice dev blog talking specifically about what they had in mind for balance and when, people wouldn't be as mad.

I've only bothered to do the vip sites just to prove to myself I could do it triple boxing my 3 toons. But other than that, its not worth the time. The rewards suck and now I cant seem to find anymore vip sites. Meh
---
CCP wants new/more players and their not getting/keeping them. It was a tough game to learn back then. Kids these days seem to want everything handed to them and CCP has done a fine job making the game easy to learn. But in doing so, seems to have taken a lot of fun out of the game. Hulkagedden (which I was a victom of, lol) The 1st Burn Jita (where I got my revenge), etc... Made the game a lot more fun. When we started playing, the 1st guys recruited our whole BF 42 gameing group! (wish we got rewards for that in those days) My point is, I have no reason to promote the game. When people like me find a reason, the online accounts will shoot up to 50K or better again.

Just my 2 cents worth as I climb into my flame retardant battle suit.

If you visit the stations where these containers are located you can see what's inside them and pull stuff out for a 15% fee.
---
People did as in the 1st event or 2 they went for a barge or exhumer and it gave them still OK income if they also did the combat side of it and actually produced the cerebrals. It wasn't great by any stretch, but it was OK.
---
Also unweary newbs. Now this is particularly bad because now they can't get more injectors, their combat skills are shit and they're stuck on negative ISK activity or most boring shit in the game, so they leave.
---
AT brought me back to the game after a 3 year break,  I don't see why the major alliances could not run their own league tournament.
---
Don't you people have twitch on your phones...

ya fuck me they might see a downflux of 50 subs that only sub 1 month a year anyway 4head

Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

Do I feel the dev blog itself is a bait and switch, yes I do. I think that's been well established in many other posts, but I can not see how the title is 'misleading'. 
---
Is it the exclamation point? I just don't get how the title is misleading on any positive or negative slant, nor what it's relation to the article gets it to a misleading title.
---
It's formatted like any other 'eye catching' banner ad I'd make for a website. Perhaps it's more of a disappointment when opening, or maybe they could've prepared someone for bad news on the ad itself, but it's really not misleading in my opinion.
---
Shit I forgot to mention in my OP, the stations are in nullsec space.
---
I, too, enjoy watching someone else mine for 20 minutes.

Every time it’s brought up, the war deccers who abuse this mechanic comes out and lobbies CCP to keep it as is. CCP needs to grow a set and tell them to fuck off and fix this abuse already.
---
Literally loot boxes.
---
CCPls we don't like loot boxes and never will, stop trying to force them on us.
---
Add to that the fact that CCP almost cancelled AT last year makes this change VERY concerning.
---
see you in 2020 so ?
---
Never mind. I am an idiot and was only looking at the name of the container not the station they were located in. They were moved to stations inside of LoveSac space so I should be able to get there and access the containers
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
I'm in a small corp with some friends. We can do whatever we want, but usually sell to the corp at slightly under sell order rates for the convenience of not having to haul it and manage orders or whatever. CEO either resells it or uses it for industry since no one else really does that.  
---
If we want to be more involved in making things, we can make more of the profit.
---
Your right. The AT has always been a joke.
---
Thats my point.
---
If they dump the AT but we actually DO start getting monthly somewhat significant balance patches, im totally fine with it. We're ehard this all before though, Tiericide was bullshit and one or 2 ships still dominate each group of them. Tell me the last time the arbitrator did a job better or even as GOOD AS, any other ship in the same price range.
---
I'm glad it didn't get as big as WOW.  The developers would have wrecked it and turned  it into some space pve fest.  Blech.
---
Possibly - but if that were the case, it wouldn’t have even been worth noting. Bug reports would have been going down since shortly after the issue started. The fact that they dropped after the January patches shows a strong correlation and suggests causation.
---
Neutral logistics go suspect, though.
---
So which is it blame PA who has owned CCP for what maybe 8 months...
---
Or blame CCP who canned a pile of their Devs over the past few years and the game just isnt the same.
---
You’re still more optimistic than I am. Every decision they’ve made for the last few years has fucked small gang and this style of gameplay. They want their stagnant empires and boring laggy battles that happen twice a year.
---
I.E. we killed the alliance tournament since we introduced asinine rules about betting isk
---
Because the mineral price needs to be around 800k isk per you mined wannabe.
---
&gt; funny how you completely missed the point. Your idea of an unavoidable DD is broken. If it has a fair warning and I can avoid being hit reasonably well, then I would be very much fine with it (funny how you didn't read that statement btw).  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;It's also funny that you think that the umbrella is this level of retarded OP'nes. Tell me one thing: if you really believe that, how are you able to bind your shoes in the morning? Oh I see, Velcro. :)
---
Sure it's avoidable. Just invade the wormhole and kill the DDing Titan. See you have all the tools you need to do it but you don't want to.
---
&gt;Your hypothetical point about Wormhole DD's proposed an I-win button you can't defend against nor can you avoid it. Tell me how that is equivalent to A superumbrella you a.) know is there, b.) you can see coming from miles away by the cyno and c.) you can counter with enough capitals of your own.  
---
&gt;If these 3 conditions (warning, avoidable, counterable) are met for your WH doomsday, then go ahead. According to your suggestion, they aren't and it would be broken by every definition of balance. The same can not be said for supers though and even if you can somehow demonstrate that it is, then why do you want, instead of nerfing capital umbrellas to make it easier for you to deal with them, remove the only line of defense a PvE player has in the absence of an alliance?
---
Oh you can avoid it. Use your citadels to avoid them by being inside of them. And you can defend against them. Invade the wormhole and destroy them.  
---
Capitals can use some nerfing sure. Specifically the ability of Sirens is kind of meh.
---
&gt;The answer to that is: because you hate other playstyles and because these PvE'ers are 99.9999% of the content you seek so very much: Easy kills.  
---
&gt;Proof me wrong.
---
You are the one making the accusation I just want to hit PvE'ers. I'll take any target. I'm not picky. I support mechanics that make it so there's no such thing as a "pve ship." All ships should be bit capable of PvPing.
---
&gt; less value is not equivalent to no value. Glad that you understood the point. Oh wait, you failed at that again. Sad thing. 
---
1 ISK is not "no value." Nice try.
---
&gt; Well, then give me another conclusion to the cause for the clear numbers on the MER. I've asked you for such a conclusion 20 times already. You refused to adress that. Give me your conclusion on why these numbers are the way they are and why the start of the production/destruction increase was the day rorquals became good at mining. Before you say "I did that already" to dodge that argument again: QUOTE your conclusion. 
---
Delve is hugely populated and as such more things die there. (Also Goons are pretty bad.) None of this backs your argument that "cheaper ships means more pvp."
---
&gt;I suggested that *may* happen. What your point fails to adress is: how does that equate to more PvPer vs PvPer fights when they clearly don't want that. They don't do it now, so why do you think that would change if you would have even less content generators (aka pve'rs) in space because the higher risks makes people opt out of it?  
---
&gt;It doesn't make sense.
---
You haven't established your claim that PvPers don't want pvp. You speak as if it's just a given they avoid fights when it's not true. Furthermore having no local means increasing the "fog of war" aspect of engagements. So it's easier to set up ambushes and counter-ambushes meaning more combat.
---
&gt; Because they don't do it now and removing local wouldn't help with adressing the reasons why they don't. They don't do it because they don't have the tools and manpower to have a realistic chance at succeeding. It's simple and I've said that time and time again really. It get's old that you still insists it's anything else. 
---
But all this time you said that everyone has the tools to do this. Now they don't?
---
&gt; So your point is: You are too dumb to bubble some unprepared rorquals and it's the games fault. And you talk about skill lmao. 
---
Yeah dude let me kill a Rorqual with a destroyer and two cruisers. Hot herbivore take.
---
&gt; it's legitimately boring. Hunting PvE'ers for the chance of getting an Ego boost out of winning a fight stacked in my favor. I certainly don't find that exciting. On the flipside, roaming brave space and waiting to get dropped on at a gate to see how much we can take out is fun. But you don't do fights you can't win so what would you know about that. 
---
Who said anything about just hunting PvE'ers? Are they "too stupid to fight back lmao?" Your KB is shit because you're a krab.
---
&gt; The game clearly has evolved away from "Being ISK efficient matters" - Nowadays, it's being able to replace your losses quickly. You can't replace a lost super quickly so naturally, you don't like it because it disadvantages your playstyle. 
---
lol you krabs grind, die to us and replace your losses. You keep doing it. We'll keep killing you. I have no problems with this arrangement.
---
&gt;By all accounts though: the new "Meta" has undone some of the damage fozzieSoV caused and has managed to stop the bleeding of players (which we had before nov 2016 as evident (!) by the average player count before/after the change) and it lead to more destruction and production as evident by MER numbers.  
---
&gt;So, by available metrics, it had a positive effect and your "I don't like it" simply isn't enough of an argument against that.
---
Local increased the number of people who play Eve? GENIUS TAKE lmao. How fucking stupid you are.
---
There are one key thing: 1) zkill is volountary - if nobody having access to the kill in killlog has ESI in and nobody posts it manually, it doesn't show. I don't know what CCP would have to do to make their killboard in a way that doesn't misguide as 100% reliable source of all kills while keeping the volountary part going.
---
Because, you know, kills are intel.
---
We love templis bros. Yall actually punish me when I make risky plays. :(
---
If you use jEveAssets (java program) you can see all items you own, and where they are. This includes showing the contents of asset safety containers, so you don't have to travel 20 jumps to find a rookie ship I  a container ;)
---
Not so long ago most of my shit got moved from sov null to low sec NPC stations via asset safety. Black Frog Logistics moved it for me. If your asset safety wraps are in NPC stations you could take a ceptor there and arrange for anything of value to be freighted to market.  
---
Yeah plz explain, I've quit eve years ago but I start subbed here because it's good memes
---
wich makes "basic" acccerators 60m+ per unit, and the garbage lootboxes ATLEAST 5m isk 
---
Been saying for a while now the  biggest thing going for Eve is players having a lot invested time wise. They've accumulated a lot of time, SP, isk, and Plex so might as well ride it out.
---
Well I’m enjoying the game, perks of being new.. lol
---
Elise is right. 
---
Same here but it's too expensive for my blood too, unfortunately! 
---
jesus how did you get 20 crates that quickly
---
no ty
---
Useful. I learned something today thanks :)
---
just drop supers on it 
---
Yes, they do. That's one of the reasons I like to follow merc group wars to pick off free ooc logi
---
this is such a trash take. you're the one confusing "no value for me" with "no value for anybody." god forbid people get rewarded for putting time and effort to provide entertainment for the community. 
---
there is potential for collusion in any competitive event, you could make the same complaint about any real-life sport where there is a lot of money involved. (or "dole", as you call it, jfc)
---
It’s ok, I’ll name one of my alts after you and sub 😜👹
---
Huh. Musta missed that. Grr pearl abyss!
---
You don't have to delve into the same genre so soon, take a break and play something fresh, hell maybe even single player games, i took a break from multiplayer games alltogether lately and started catching up on what i've missed out on these past few years ( witcher 3, dark souls trilogy, pillars of eternity and a bunch of amazing indie games ) and man i've been having a blast.

Found the CCP employee attempting damage control. CCP's sale to Pearl Abyss came with a clause that states the sellers only get the maximum payout if the company reaches certain financial goals with a set period of time after the sale goes through it was part of the publicly announced info included with the sale announcement.
---
Thanks for all you did with the AT logibro. The best moments of my EVE career were because of you.  
---
The community owes you a lot. 
---
Hilmar has single handedly killed this videogame.
---
I 100% agree, they need to take more bold risks like this, but if they're not prepared to iterate when the risks don't quite work out then there's literally no point
---
hey at least you can use that, imagine how all the people getting an item literally called "trash" felt?
---
Hmm, did Pearl Abyss ask you not to host AT because you have thousands of viewers and BDO’s Arena of Arsha doesn’t get much of an attention?
---
I mean - you can't even search for T3 cruisers that had covert cyno fit. Looking up how people fit their hunters post T3C changes took a lot of manual browsing before I just gave up and put week long API listener to process in automatically.
---
you seem to have misspelled space catholic
---
To be honest a lot of the shit we get is propably indirectly caused by PA. I have no inside information but I assume the costcutting and revenue goals are quiet strict giving CCP little room to breath. Not saying CCP does a good job and we should absolutely go full reeee, I just think it's not only CCPs fault.
---
Facebook doesn't say anything. Im talking about common parlance of its users
---
I'd be extremely happy by just having compressed data dump up until certain point in time and then maybe daily dumps - you can still fetch kills live from zkill API endpoint and that gives all the data needed to do whatever advanced search/processing you want to do.
---
Just as a warning - I tried doing something more clever with zkill in early 2018, mainly a tool that would give me useful info about a pilot in relation to others (how often he flies solo, if it's dedicated tackle, cyno alt - if so, what characters can it be associated with), I quickly ended up eating over 2TB of disk space (with a lot of redundant data to speed up processing per kill - like list of all system IDs in jump range from system the kill happened) and having optimised by hand queries/checks for relatively simple cases taking several mintes at best. All that on several weeks of raw data from API endpoint.

Come back to the game after a year..   
---
People unironically bragging how much they mine..  
---
Now no AT..   
---
Injectors and invulnerable ships..   
---
Things so bad i am thinking of going back to gross things like sex and friends and sports
---
Well that's the point, it should be a colour selector.
---
You only want inventory and fitting window to be coloured, that works too.
---
That’s not enough. If a neutral decides to interfere with a way, they should immediately become a valid war target for the remainder of the war.
---
Are you sure that I said "no value for anybody"? Read it again. You may need to look up the meaning of the word "assert."
---
And, yeah, it's the yearly dole for colluders. Other competitive events don't typically involve the creation from whole cloth of wealth by the actual creators of the universe they're in.
---
Shame collective back at it...againg. 
---
Even with injectors the boosters valuable for high skill players. At 80m+ sp the advanced gives you actually more sp than a large injector.
---
Ohhh boy... You should see the event related page in the Oficial fórum!
---
It's a shit show, so many people feeling like CCP REALLY dropped the ball in this one! :(
---
I’ll sub back when AT is back. Until then...no. 
---
Hmmkay, you wanna see my duck? 
---
Oh you mean like it takes two sites worth of ORE to refine enough to turn in one ticket so you'll never even actually be able to do it properly? absolute trash tier. This is seriously low, even for CCP.
---
lol whatever, you sound like another fag neckbeard who will just keep paying CCP while they part EVE out one piece at a time, while also having your own teenage hormonal freak out that some like me take issue with how CCPs been running their shop the past couple years.
---
tl;dr fuck yourself retard
---
Basically, the one caveat is that you can get bosonned on the gate by ~~NPC goons~~ Artemis rats
---
At least use some lube next time
---
I will miss all 3 of them
---
Its only a shit show because of worthless commentary like yours. If you never cared about it then maybe try shutting the fuck up, those of us who did care are discussing it. 
---
Sov isn't an acronym, no need to capitalise it
---
they still haven't reverted the chat?
---
Magic and mystery!😮
---
Yea.... am around Zinkon area right now, logged in near Dodixie, been flying all around by Jita, and everywhere until I got here. And am seeing all those "majority" of players in the event sites ..... O and the event and the newb channels ..... you ought to really check those out ...  I mean seriously, so full of players "enjoying" themselves ....
---
/s
---
Not the only thing that died today.
---
Cancer on cancer
---
You'll always be Logibro to me, CCP or no CCP. We're getting another suite in Vegas this time. Please come to protect us from security XD
---
I never participated and only watched maybe two matches ever. I’m still annoyed at this choice. I always quietly aspired to do it one day. They just lowered the bar on the Eve end game... it’s not like it’s a pvp game anymore anyway. 
---
Man, good thing they are using resources to give us quality content like the guardians gala. 
---
They slightly nerfed the retribution months ago... That's not much.
---
Every man should have the option of stealing all the loot and running. Welcome to EVE.
---
I can make one, contract to horaculus Riven ingame.
---
what tha fack
---
100%
---
That is probably what I'm going to end up doing. Thought it's only 13 jumps or so outside amarr, so it may not be too bad getting it back
---
Deffo this one. Full loot pvp action shooter. Still in beta but devs are really involved and committed. 
---
My 10000 man alliance fought off a 10 man corp therefore 10 man corp sucks 
---
It's cute that you think this is the only place where the eve community expresses its opinoon.
---
CCP needs some developers and not company mouth pieces. 
---
I disgree with that. Bugs are just bugs that can and will be fixed, well ought to be fixed but maybe won't be cause CCP...
---
However, even if you fix all the bugs, and the shit actually works, people still won't run it. It will be like permafrost. Come in, do like maybe 1-2 of em, say WTF is this shit ? And leave. 
---
So bugs or no bugs, they will end up empty except for very few unique special hardcore farmer snowflakes, just like the last one. Therefore, bugs don't matter.
---
This, also the fact that if you don't have a alt sitting in the site after you clean it and leave to get a mining ship, the site despawn and you lose the mining, the carrier boss fight only rewarding logs, the spawn rate of sites, and Soo much more stuff lol
---
No, you are missing the point. It was changed. It was announced. There was a problem after the change and it was fixed. 
---
The change is that cynos now have their own category instead of being stuck with all of the other beacons that most folks don't care about.
---
Looks at rorqual online...did you just say “pvp”?
---
Damn dude... this is starting to feel similar to when dark age of Camelot started to die. Wtf did I do with my life...
---
Isn't it just gone for a year though?
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
There are none. This is the reason behind EVE's longevity, despite Hilmar shooting the company in the foot dozens, if not hundreds of times.
---
Maybe Albion Online, its sweet and sour
---
good luck o7
---
They cancelled it
---
It’s always an adventure with a venture 
---
Paranoia lvl 5 is a must. 
---
wat?
---
Wormcloner btw
---
I'll see myself out.
---
maybe they just realize bombers are more fun than "objective fleet" and less risky, because often rorquals fight solo without "save my ass fleet" ;-)
---
Well, looks like I won't be returning to the game this year. I can't say for sure if I'll come back, even if the tournaments eventually do.
---
Tournament PVP in EVE is what kept me in the game for so long. It scratched a competitive gaming itch that I've had since 2005. I was never that great, but no matter which team I was on, I felt like I was actually *part* of something amazing. The feeling of taking notes and bashing heads with the best of the best. The feeling of camaraderie between twelve-ish people from across the globe, brought together by months of training. The butterflies when the timer starts to tick down. The brief moment of fame when Elise makes an offhand remark about your positioning.
---
If this is really the end of EVE's tournament scene, I'm glad to have snuck in at the end to participate in it. But at this point, I don't have the energy or the passion to push for its return. I'd be satisfied if the last fight I had in EVE was my last ever.
---
Brett, Taston, fly safe IRL.
---
Sincerely,
---
Leonard Umbriel
---
Yea, I wish there was more STUFF about it and what we're getting - though I'm glad they gave people notice instead of waiting until May/June to say "oh lol no AT btw"
---
If it returns, great. If not, though, I will hardly be surprised. Hilmar's slippery downhill slope
---
There wont be any pvpers left for AT2020 at this rate anyways. Can't wait to watch 10 100mn afk vnis Duke it Out tho!
---
I would like to be able to come to that same conclusion, but the fact that the AT has survived this long only due to the sacrifice and dedication of a few amazing devs (thank you guys btw) without any real support from CCP (like, at least giving them time to do it so do they don't have to do it on their free time would have mean a lot) makes it really really hard.
---
Hope you are right, but all this years seem to point the opposite way.
---
Daybreak anyone and Planetside Arena?
---
Shockingly constructive in a rabble-rabble-rabble-loot-box-rabble world.
---
Test server
---
yeah? fuck you too, buddy :D
---
That was a good story, and sorry for your loss.  I was able to imagine what was transpiring. 
---
They won't listen, they fired their community staff remember
---
The work around is to use a better mapping tool. I suggest https://wormholes.new-eden.io/
---
I second this. Also Hi person formerly known as CCP Logibro.
---
I would start by joining a null alliance like pandemic horde or brave newbies, then learn from them, solo mining in null is generally not worth it, the alliances will give you the infrastructure like athanors, jump freighters, and manufacturing facilities that you need to make isk.
---
It should have. When I was a noob two years ago one of the things I deliberately did *not* do was join a corp - among other reasons - but mostly because of wardecs.
---
In retrospect this really hobbled the game for me and made things incredibly difficult - about a year ago I accidentally became friends with a corp that was full of people who knew what they were doing, and I grew to trust enough that I joined them despite the dangers.
---
I wound up learning about things I didn't even know I didn't know about so much faster it wasn't even funny.
---
If I hadn't been scared silly by the idea of wardecs early on, I could have gotten that kind of help much sooner.
---
maybe lay off #illum and actually play the game for a while, because this might just be the most out-of-touch thing I've seen you post here
---
Try blopsing on null ratters. Or wormhole space. You never thought of that.
---
I recently made another account btw, because it's so much fun to surprise people with a few days off alt that suddenly has great skills :P
---
Ugh.
---
I think they announced it not once, not twice, but three times on the site and via the launcher with months in advance that you needed to add it to your overview if you wanted it to show up properly once the change actually went through.
---
I've seen over 90 wormholes in them at present.
---
They should be similar, but they're broken now. Somewhere between useless and covering the entire game would be good 
---
I was surprised by how long i could tank the null sec rats in a Prospect. My downfall was getting pointed, webbed and dead. Give it a try. Afterall, the only thing you're going to lose is a cheap frigate 
---
What's out of touch about the AT being a dole? It is. If CCP removed the dole, I'd have no problems with the AT whatsoever. Hell, I'd be a little upset about this year's AT being cancelled, even, if there wasn't a dole in the first place.
---
Also, since when was I running Goonswarm Federation, or even tangentially involved at all? I'm just a line member.
---
Goodbye Old Friend. You lasted loner than I did.
---
You're such a loser lmao
---
You need a procurer and T2 light drones to survive alone in a null belt. The ore anomalies are usually the way to go. But afk mining in a venture for anything but r64 moon ores nets you less isk than logging in for 10 min and doing any site in a vni. I used to be a miner and then i realized i could accomplish just as much in an hour ratting as i could in 5 hours mining with max skills. Buy the ore for manufacturing jobs from npcs or the turds that haven't awakened yet and profit.
---
Init pinged saying they've had over 100 in one hole. 
---
Most of the gaming subs that I visit seem to be fairly negative and I know that could be argued that people give a damn about said game, but fucking hell it doesn’t half get draining. 
---
I’m not saying the merits of the idea are bad quite the opposite... what I’m pondering here and I could easily be wrong is .. that this feels like an experienced eve player or someone who has enough understanding of eve role playing their “what if I was new” vs actually being new ... objection leading the witness, goes to state of mind your honor 
---
snuff deployed away from the north. it really irritated my corp it worked out that way with how hard we worked to not be a tri bitter ex like the others.

This is one of the best things ive read today. As a member of the PL team you whooped - thank you for writing this, i really hope ccp hears the outcry of the community they claim to be apart of and listen to it, so that more stories like this may happen

Got to give this point some credit: If you add up everything, it really feels like some G[lengarry Glen Ross'smugg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbN9LbuBHk0) walke into CCP office to stop having the devs a productive, meaningful, fun relationship with their customers.
---
I mean, I know they've always had a lot, and thought it cool. Init pinging saying they have a hundred holes, yeah that's every region in the game.. with a stuka fleets mobility and mass, that's pretty broken.

There was a tournament on Thunderdome just last month, but it hadn't been updated since before the ecm changes.

An important thing to note about the alliance tournament for many years:  Most dev's generally donate spare time.  They weren't getting paid they did it as a labor of love.
---

So I’m already in the station that I can’t dock into wouldn’t my clone stay at that station when I jump to another clone? And I’d be able to jump back or no?

Which is bullshit on their company's part.
---
who do I talk to about getting old alliance tournament footage?
---
I'm interested in archiving it. the players have always been better stewards of this game anyway 
---
I legit cried. I’ve never participated and barely watched but always have planned to do it someday. It’s the real end game for the pvp Eve is supposed to represent. Ripping it out is the last straw - eve is now pve. Fuck this. 
---
The loot box comments may be a rant, but that doesn’t make them wrong. 
---
Oh go it's a fucking mess. Youtibe has most (not all) of the last 6 years or so, CCP Fozzie is the best contact for the super old stuff. One of the reasons I started (and never completed sadly) my AT Histories on CZ was to try not to lose those stories :(
---
isn't it only canceled for this year?
---
To put this in perspective, canceling the AT tournament for eve players would be like if the NCAA canceling march madness or the NFL said they were going to take a year from doing the super bowl so they can rethink how the playoffs work
---
Yes, having many connections which gives entities new avenues to confront each other and drive content is broken.
---
You're putting a lot of trust into nullsec folk to get your wormhole knowledge.

you tell me, hotshot. why is null dead and stagnant?

is it the players fault?

Don't worry I couldn't give a shit about downvotes, its just a shame to see so many ungrateful drama queens that proclaim to be a "really incredible community". That's becoming a tough line to follow when every time, *literally everytime,* anything is announced this sub and the forums go off about it like CCP just said subs were going up to $/£100 a pop. 
---
I'm not saying CCP don't make frequent mistakes but fucking hell some people need to take a step back and stop being so over dramatic, because if it's a put off for me, no wonder this game has so much trouble encouraging new players to join the community.
---
It’s over. Read top post on the sub right now. Devs gonna focus on “balancing”
---
That's stupid. If you are leaving just rmt your shit and actually get a chunk of change for it
---
Did you try breaking point in arma 3 before it died? Was really fun compared to vanilla.
---
no, u.
---
Any day other than today, people would be blaming the Goons for null being dead and stagnant, but I guess today is CCP's turn in the barrel. 
---
The response fleet does use tracking disruptors, (Which have nearly infinite range). So it's likely that your drones were disrupted which causes them to not track obviously.
---
Some of the vets that have “quit” push players away too, I noticed that around this reddit. Anyway, I noticed another thing, no matter what CCP does, people will find a reason to bitch and cry about, even if that reason is non existent. Like you know, what the fuck CCP why is there no oxygen in space?
---
Who could downvote this? You motherfuckers.
---
CCP for as long as I have played this game have stated that they're going to focus on balance. 
---
Time and again we've seen the release of features, many of which were broken on release, that months later were abandoned for the next thing on their plate, meanwhile ignoring blatant issues with basic ship balance until it was either bitched about long enough to turn it into a meme or rammed down their throats(sentry comps, carrier blobs).
---
Whatever happened to drifters, incursions, fw, etc.? 
---
Meanwhile a not so small portion of the playerbase looks back at things like the summer of rage and the release of Incarna with the opinion that it was all overreaction and stupidity. Ignoring that even then players what players did not want was a broken mess of a patch release in a game that was near 10 years old at that time.
---
We're 16 years in at this point, in the midst of a world tour, but for what? A world tour celebrating a game that its maker cannot even maintain simple services like an in game chat system correctly?
---
Also, what type of balance are we really going to see? A one off pass like in the past where a couple smaller numbers are tweaked and nothing really changes except exchanging one fotm comp for another? Or are we going to get some blowout, much aggrandized balance pass like with t3cs where three out of four of the ships fucked with become mostly obsolete and the other idiotically good in comparison?
---
I get that people enjoy the game, cool, but a continuous pattern has become apparent over the years and it's frustrating to hear the same song and dance every goddamn year.
---
Nullsec folk don't need to know anything. You need one fc who knows wormholes and one person who can scan. Everyone else takes fleet warps. It's not hard.
---
Having many connections - like 20-30 - is normal. 100 is broken. Allowing a force of 400 dudes to move across the entire map, with stukas being that strong, isn't intentional and is broken. 
---
that is a very odd example i feel like
---
Well with no more AT my favorite bit of commentary will now always [be this one](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/293414007?t=03h51m00s)
---
I started a new corp and want an office near Jita. Office space is expensive in nearby NPC stations but dirt cheap in player owned stations. 
---
1. What happens to personal and corporate assets if a station is destroyed or unanchored (if possible)?
---
2. Can the owners of the station set it to private, locking us out of our assets?
---
3. What are some other things to know about using a player owned station as a corporate home base?
---
4. Should we just buy and anchor our own?

That was incredibly informative and well-written - thanks Elise.  Also to everyone who have helped make prior Alliance Tournaments

I just wish we had more to look forward to this year
---
I only got to fly in one tourney for one round, but it was a great experience. Sad to see it go!
---
Most PvE is trash and the same thing. The cinematic are what immerse people
---
:doubt:
---
Even in our small alliance which only participated in 2 alliance tournaments so far there where a lot of People just resubbing to play in the at.... i dont wanta know how many subs where lost to this stupid decision  
---
I'm not saying you're wrong talking this direction, and something player-run probably will come out of this, but it won't be the same.
---
Allegedly.  Optimism isn't exactly running rampant though.
---
same i had around 7 now i got 3 and every other month 4. but it just seems... so forced
---
Yeah, that's exactly what it is. 100% of the extra structure is the turret mount itself, likely just an attachment point where the ogre's "cannons" were on the model. It's actually a pretty good kitbash, though.
---
You really hit the nail on the head. There's far too much catering to the safe player that just crabs and has supers that can do every role. It's really unfortunate as I have yet to find another game that has that consequence level of eve, yet still has the aspect of building up and developing your character(s). Tbh if eve does die I'm considering just not playing video games anymore, I have no idea what game will be able to scratch that itch that eve satisfies, or satisfied.
---
BL has been dead for some time now.
---
Really think there's going to BE and EVE next year?
---
Given every other ore needs 100 units, I think they fat fingered it like they did the battleship DPS

It's not the diamond miners. It's the rats that drop minerals.

---
nice aar
---
I just started playing 4 months ago, I was hoping to be able to join the AT. Damn that sucks.
---
Because even letting the playerbase do 95% of the work (see the player-hosted tournaments that didn't happen due to last years layoffs) is too much effort.  Proves CCP is fucking useless and doesn't have an ounce of respect for the community at this point.
---
Never been very good at eve but I would always buy a couple plex and ship spin watching the AT in my other monitor. Was awesome the year(s?) When evebet was a thing. Betting on and rooting for teams. 
---
Well, they told us there would be an AT this year after some of the rough patches we went through last year. If they lie about that we have no reason to think they won't lie about bringing it back.
---
And it might not even be the same AT we love if they do bring it back, as per some of Falcon's comments on the topic. I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes a cap brawl or something stupid. 
---
Fun fight.  Cerbs/eagles/jackdaws/munnins vs \~100 carriers, horde baltecs, and a few odd bombers.  Spent the better part of two hours shooting horde fighters. Had a lot of fun hazing the bombers that booshed into us though.  Thanks for coming out to fight!
---
Honestly, Don’t bother, that’s just giving CCP what they want.

They know they can feed off the goodwill of the player base, and they will use that if we offer it. So quite frankly, if the want no AT and want to commit to that, they can suffer the consequences of that decision and the ultimate death of the AT, because you can be sure as hell that if it does come back many of the major names won’t be around to run their teams and thus it may as well stay dead.
---
The CSM is going to be abolished, this cuts into CCPs bottom line when they are paying to fly people out.
---
Been playing for a year, can confirm I get killed within 30 seconds when lucky
---
shitty company buys the game out, what did you expect? Its just going to keep getting worse as long as they get $$$. They don't care about you, the customer anymore they only care about your fucking wallets.
---
The Daedalus was significantly smaller than a Hive ship but it regularly took them on in 1v2 and 1v3 situations and won. That was with the wraith having the ability to jam asgard beaming tech as well - something that doesn't exist in the Eve universe. There was a point where it took on an entire fleet at once, destroyed 2 or 3 hives, and successfully fled.
---
Purely in terms of size that makes some sense but I'm not sure about class equivalent because ship classes typically don't have much to do with size and a lot to do with the design. 
---
In terms of rough equivalent 'power' - the Daedalus class likely trumps a titan, or multiple titans, with ease. Titans are very slow and cumbersome and we've seen Daealus class ships effectively instawarp from a near dead stop in Eve terms. The power of a DD from what I gathered is actually pretty low when compared to stargate energy levels (when they aren't plot armoring orbital bombardments with the goauld / wraith). The warm up time on a DD is also slow enough that based on what the Daealus class ships regularly did, it could simply warp away long before it even fired - or just beam a nuke on board and wipe it from existence. That's also assuming direct hits with every type of DD could even significantly damage the shields but the specs of what they both can do are kind of elusive.
---
They've also shown they can beam with extremely high precision and scan alien craft for weakpoints with relative ease. Even without nukes, the Daedalus class can simply beam ordinance directly to the pod - or beam the pod out of the titan. If we assume knowing the weak points is deus ex machina, they can still beam lower yield ordinance directly to all of the very visible guns + engines and effectively disable the ship.
---
Without beaming tech I'd still rate the Daedalus pretty far above a titan. With it the ship can basically take out very large titan fleets by itself. Without the ship can still abuse the warp time and speed in combination with the firepower to probably kill however many are under the number it would take to time DD's in such a way that they could hit them on the inbound trip or something, again that's assuming they even do significant amounts of damage.
---
If you use this thread as a baseline - https://forums.eveonline.com/t/doomsday-math/39211 - there are 3 scenarios where it would take multiple direct hits with a DD to put the shields under significant strain and one scenario that likely instantly obliterates the daedalus even with a ZPM, but it might not take out every Daedalus class (The Odyssey specifically). Old school DD's probably still don't come close to that estimate. I'm partial to the last option in that thread - which is also the second strongest.
---
Given that the Odyssey survived multiple direct hits from several Orii battleships at once for several minutes.  That ship had power generation levels similar to that of an ancient ship and its generally considered that the last shield type developed by the asgard finally rivaled that of the ancients because of the above. That's pretty loose but it's what we've got. So we know that Odyssey had a ZPM but it also had asgard power generation of its own. We know that 3 ZPM's working in tandem after taking a focused bombardment from the wraith of a size capable of beating the ancients for an unknown period of time then proceeded to keep the city shielded from several hundred feet of water for 10,000 years. We also know that 1 half powered ZPM was estimated to be probably able of wiping out a solar system if detonated properly and at a minimum destroying the planet Earth.
---
I think the Odyssey in particular would easily directly face tank and completely obliterate all of new eden, maybe even with turbo DD's.
---
Yeah that was pretty fun.
---
&gt;A lot of people seem to think CCP are idiotic, and make ill-informed decisions that only /r/Eve can identify.  
---
I mean this seems like a totally ridiculous sentiment right, that they *must* understand that this is detrimental and a huge issue of contention for what non-bot community remains.
---
Yet they fired the entire community team.  
---
And they poured gorillions of m3 of minerals into the game to make Rorquals good (or whatever).  
---
And they exacerbated the issue of supercapital proliferation not only with that change, but with the introduction of skill injectors.  
---
And they've had significant game balance issues for... as long as most people can remember.  
---
And they introduced a chat system that fundamentally broke an existing (and functioning) chat system... following the direction of... I don't know.  
---
And they've had latency issues for almost as long as they've had balance issues.  
---
Saying Reddit is wrong isn't usually an incorrect statement. A lot of people (myself especially included especially because I'm intentionally inflammatory most of the time) are wrong on this subreddit. That doesn't mean we're wrong now, and it certainly doesn't mean CCP are right.  
---
I don't think anyone trying to quantify the significance of the loss of the Alliance Tournament are wrong in any way, it's one of the only "mass exposure" events we have, and it's not just important to players already in our community. 
---
the sides here are a bit confusing.
---
can someone sort them out?
---
and loved that fight.  despite the tidi that bounced from 21% to 46%.   the lag was very controllable so i was able to constantly look around the field without any d/c issues.
---
thanks for the fight! 
---
Being podded does not equal "disconnected"
---
eve is still in beta. hopefully they fix issues in the major release.
---
amen
---
AT Morale Post.. Its dead folks.
---
Hmm, idk. I'm really looking forward to the rapidly deteriorating economy that splits the community into highsec poors and supercap pilots. 
---
You mean CCP\_Shill?
---
i ran 5 clients and did not dc once
---
love you blood, great post
---
CCP probably wants to outsource this anyway
---
I'm out of the loop. What's wrong with chat?
---
Only one side got disconnections looks like
---
The only time you post about disconnects are when you lose smh
---
if u dont like the game you play find another one ezpz... u complain about bad parts of the game but turn around and use same broken mechanics in high sec vs horde w/ wardecs
---
two clients. no issues on my end.
---
I'm disappointed by this decision, and I'm concerned that there's an uncertain vision for Eve that is being demonstrated by CCP lately. 
---
CCP (or, if we're being honest, its senior leadership) needs to get humble, be honest about their goals, and embrace what Eve already has to offer. Between engaged players and emergent content, on the one hand, as well as some good investment in tools over the past few years, on the other, CCP has a lot it can use. It needs to continue to support symbols, such as the AT, and also iterate on existing features and systems. It needs to balance regularly and with a dedicated team. It needs to focus on the little things. It needs to have a clear, strong vision - and that vision should be aligned better with players, and players in various areas of the game.
---
Blapping that stuka fleet that booshed in a wee bit too close to our Eagle fleet made the tidi fighter shoot worth it.
---
Thats alot of lore
---
I don't DC ever either, and I notice some people have the same problem over and over.  But I've worked with some of these people, and can't really find anything they're doing wrong.  Someone suggested it might be regional.
---
what the fuck are you talking about
---
the cerb fleet i was on didn't get dc'd at all
---
was watching the whole fight non stop.  no d/c. 
---
then again, guessing because you guys warped in and out of grid, the load would cause DCs.  not sure how you'd fix that other than to have a warp out of range to load grid first....talk about troublesome.
---
That was easily my favorite part too and a nice break from shooting fighters.  And the 2-3 poor battleship pilots who got blapped.
---
Oh god
---
crash != d/c.
---
turn off effects
---
Ugh. 13 years and this news is really concerning. Granted, I hardly log. Recruiting is like pulling teeth. If they don't come up with something....idk.
---
I mean people still play EQ1. Right?
---
people turn their shit to low but dont turn off effects or show only brackets necessary 
---
No mention of rorquals botting, downvoted
---
You are missed. Thanks for all you did.
---
They said they're not going to because "it sucks less now".  Yeah, its not totally down literally every day now, but its still shit.  Like CCP.
---
LMAO imagine judging what’s broken or not by looking at Legacy pings. 
---
For the serious note, drifter holes were actually broken before with almost no connections and were fixed, so what you’re seeing is just working as expected. They are easy to manage as a krab tbh and you can also use them at your own advantage. If anything it’s called emergent gameplay.
---
Team of 6 down to a team of 2, happened a while back.
---
Nothing of value was lost and had it been a shield super it would have lived.
---
Apparently some of our guys are retarded too though so there is that.
---
Damn, PGL, save the wine for Valentine's day
---
One more CCP employee here, you guys are damn bitter.
---
Instead of removing all of the parts that make EVE fun bit by bit can CCP just shut down the servers completely so I can go play something else?
---
Jesus Tap Dancing Christ would you SHUT THE FUCK UP already!
---
You're a mid-tier FC.  Face it and stop peddling your excuse crap on the rest of us,.
---
I've seen a lot of red ships warping out during the fight
---
strangely those who were primary ...
---
It doesn't matter either way, it's going to be several hundred million dollar failure whether it releases or not.  Most of the money is already sunk.  Just like their last 5 failed games.
---
They could have literally rewritten the entire EVE code base in the money they pissed away on failed games.
---
We would have lost anyway without the disconnects.  It was a good fight regardless.
---
pgl complaining about mass disconnects on a fight, oh the irony
---
one would logically assume this effects both sides then (if it occurred at all). which would mean you are posting to whine about losing. ask yourself honestly "would i post this if i had won?" and then get back to me.
---
Find an alliance with a better average ISP per capita. 
---
NCdock's recruiting
---
Listen to people progod, take this down, and factcheck, ok?
---
good post op, crazy killer reference, hope life goes well, i love vin diesl
---
There are player run tournaments occasionally, and there might be some extra this year to make up for it, but none that will be able to match the AT. Part of what makes is so cool it is that people spend hundreds of hours practicing and poor hundreds of billions of isk into it because the rewards are worth it. Glory is nice, but unique ships and shit tons of isk is something that only CCP can provide. Unless some players want to cough up trillions in rewards the high level of investment we see from teams in the AT just wouldn't be worth it for them.
---
RIP DUST for what it's worth. Could've been something.
---
Yes I would have, and have done it before lol
---
Sphere.exe does it again
---
It was already the case for last year. As I understand ccp paid for the studio rental and did the referee job. Everything else was done by +10 (former eve-nt)
---
prove it
---
I was expecting the "fighters OP" angle after that fight tbh. 
---
Apothne leans in to Elise "I wish I could quit you"
---
Same...
---
We’ll put.
---
Thanks for sharing. Was really looking forward to doing the AT this year with you and the barcode boys.
---
o/ yeah I definitely got shot. 100+ on the killmail, total deletion. GF!
---
There is literally footage of me during the UALX fight on the TIS stream bitching and complaining about the server performance as we were murdering titans and winning the fight.
---
content raitarus and the occasional gf = FULL SCALE INVASION
---
lmao drama queen.
---
ECM IS DEAD GET FUCKING REKD
---
yea totaly not like eve gains a lot of new players with the At....
---
CCP has always been this way because they are an extremely poorly managed company. Literally almost all of their problems are because of their management. 
---
I think it was more you just straight up fed to my fighters
---
ez clap
---
Nice fight. After the crashing stopped it was a pretty speedy brawl for that many people. 
---
I kept going down every couple minutes, or every time we warped onto grid. It sucked.   
---
Probably didn't make a difference for the fight, but yeah, it sucked. Wasn't even 10% tidi
---
You’ve won m8. Take your victory lap. Enjoy your game.
---
BL is red for content, blue for stratops. Like NC. is most of the time

Just because you lost, doesn't mean it was ruined...
---
better luck next time PGL
---
We loaded system for a while but not grid.  In the past war it definitely seemed to be amplified every time it was on a citadel grid.  And it seems random, sometimes it hits the capitals really hard, as it did a few times in Oijanen, and sometimes it doesn't.
---
It's weird but not unpredictable, just annoying to have to account for it.
---
i said prove not tell me a story
---
Not really.  It was a good fight and we weren't really setup to deal with fighters that well.  Like I said in the OP, it was a fine fight and I'm pretty happy with it, just annoyed by the disconnects that keep you anchored to where the people are stuck in space, or that force you to constantly have to bubble your capitals in some situations
---
Dark days my friend. Thanks for being great practice partners and the hours we spent theory crafting and nerding out. And for the hydra and Tiamat ))). Can’t tell you how sad I am we won’t get to make a run together this year.
---
also out of curiosity is this part of your reddit campaign against ccp or something separate? 
---
Which will be after shield slaves... after Angels cap ships... etc.... etc... 
---
64bit client is coming ok... stop complaining about DC.... give us a break...
---
avaren pls come back, i miss u

 &lt;3 shelby

just drop dreads lmao

My all time favourite match will always remain [this](https://youtu.be/2PYVw-D3b-s) one. I remember watching it live and holding on for dear life. What a match. Jesus Christ.
---
Oh Soundwave.... I miss the days when it was just him and StevieSG. 
---
Ya as defenders we didn't seem to have any issues. maybe it was that he tried to sig tank fighters. that doesn't work at all in this scenario 
---
I'm hoping that helps.
---
&gt; It was a good fight and we weren't really setup to deal with fighters that well.    
---
Yeahp.
---
I didn't disconnect once. Never had the first problem. Slaying your HACs was smooth sailing.
---
i would've liked to kill a sotiyo but w/e at least i can point fingers and laugh at piggles bad fc'ing
---
VNI ratting on 5 alts during op - wasn't disconnected. WTB: better internet and hardwares for the PGL
---
Fuck CCP
---
Actually I thought about that a lot, and done it too back in the day when BLOPS actually meant something. Widow was one of my favs though I haven't touched it for a long ass time cause of how bad it all has become.
---
Low effort video for your viewing adventures. Hope you enjoy

I'm not doing any of these shit events until it's as simple as warp to site, kill shit, loot, and reap rewards.

STOP!!   recruiting  goons!

Not maintenance. Harvest.

This slow burn has been going on long before pearl abyss came into the equation.

Dreddit is recruiting?

Imagine judging what's broken based off how they used to he - with like 20 connections - rather than the almost zero, or now 100+ wormholes
---
Beyond that, feel free to get falcon or someone else from ccp here to prove me wrong. It's not intentional as you know

Final timer of a PH Sotiyo,

What strikes me most about the post is how much time and effort you put into your hobby (AT) *despite* CCP.  
---
I'm not referring to the CCP Devs (heroes that helped AT), to be clear. I'm referring to their boss.   
---
You are indeed one of the good ones, who while likely enjoying much of the experience, truly do it so that others may enjoy the fruits of your labor.  
---
F the yearvwe were going to win. Thanks ccp.
---
Honestly?  CCP isn't any better.  They're probably worse, but EVE is a tight knit community and CCP used to be good developers, so so many people defend them zealously when they do shit that no other gaming community would tolerate.
---
Seriously, in what MMO would people actually deal with chat broken for a year?  3 slight number tweaks on 1/100th of the "classes" every year?  Event after event that is so broken that it doesn't even work?
---
Wait hold up a damn second - you don't get boosters? You only get blueprints and boosters can only be made? Fuck this! 
---
This needs to happen.
---
 "It doesn't matter either way, it's going to be several hundred million dollar failure" They don't have that much money to spend, that's part of why their efforts to develop multiple games at the same time keep failing. They are trying to do for hundreds of thousands what other companies spend hundreds of millions on, they can;t compete and they are too stupid at an executive level to stop trying.
---
Need to increase the amount of ore/reprocessing yield.
---
Need to significantly improve the bpc drop rate of the accelerators.
---
Need to add loot table for the rats in some form.
---
Need to either significantly improve the loot table of the gift grates, or remove the steep cost of getting one.
---
A year straight of failures and half assed platitudes topped off with a no fan fest and no AT announcement following the release of a hot pile of shit dressed up as a seasonal event does not help combat the salt levels at all.
---
We were just there for fun/stuka fleet practice.
---
My third time FC'ing stukas, we got wrecked by BL Jackdaws on the way in (I dun goofed on a couple of things)
---
By the time we got on grid and i burnt back in an interceptor we lost another portion of our fleet to disconnects so we just did a yolo boosh bomb run on the eagles and enjoyed the quick trip home *shrug*
---
We didnt bomb you guys, I saw other bombers on grid, cant remember who they were
---
This is quite feasible.  There are sufficient software tools, if they still work. People have, can, and probably would step up to handle production. There is only 1 thing we can’t do, and that’s prizes. Recycle existing but ancient AT ships.  issue 50 more Utus and Adrestias. Give out isk or plex. Whatever, we’ll handle the rest.

Eve is dead..

i think we might need a reddit post quality control
---
“For 2019 though, we want to make sure we’re fully focused on improving quality of life in New Eden”
---
NOBODY WANTS YOUR NEOCOM UPDATES AND SHIT
---
the issue with the game is it’s STAGNANT and UNBALANCED
---
How fucking hard is this to grasp and understand?
---
this was actually true, there was comms on youtube about PGL bitching about omg server performance they aren't getting out, and then you'd hear vily basically encouraging the titans to continue shoving DD's up every shield titans ass since they had hardly any fax support.   
---
It means something right now too. You just don't know how to have fun anymore
---
Thank you very much for that, I appreciate it
---
Love you man.
---
I don't think mechanically that's possible if the logi pilot is in a box corp, but yeah I completely there needs to be some kind of punishment for neutral logi and links 
---
Can we get a mining tournament CCPLEASE!!!
---
&gt;I ran client on full graphics and didn't dc.  I acknowledge my retardedness.   i did dc on the initial warp in where were perched a 100k off to load grid  though.  But as far as the fight...was good.    
---
his flair is literally 'fake chessur' hello
---
 Our fleet of only 130 
---
If you weren't blue with Goon on that fight,  I would have had empathy for you
---
I won't miss it.
---
Massive windfalls benefiting tiny groups of players. Overly strict rules lead to boring repetitive fights. Collusion and fixes put the nail in the coffin.
---
Now bring on those downvotes.
---
Dood Im really Sorry your fight was ruined by CCP's unstable connection and your shitty line Members who are dumb.  
---
I hope the next fight goes better for you.
---
I’ll vote for you Watchme! :) I have hoped to one day be on an AT team. So I’m sad that goal might not happen. I agree with the sentiment that they keep adding new shiny things while never fixing what cane before. It’s like a house of cards that the players have kept together so far. Instead of inventing new things just make the game run smooth (chat, disconnects, server stuff), and take ships that have no use and find a way to give them a purpose. No matter what though, most of us will keep playing till they shut it down. The idea of EVE is so great it makes up for a lot of the reality :)
---
Well I put the scram on to be atleast somewhat combat capable if i get into a pvp situation, I'm not a  big solo player but if someone comes into my site I'll brawl them
---
whne you care you tend to be.
---
&gt;Why tackle on a ratting fit though if no adc?
---
You just dont get my elite fittings dude :P
---
Good writing is almost as good. I got furier fiasco as a mission and I almost burst out laughing reading the intro.
---
Sunless seas also does a great job with this sort of thing.
---
It’s much cheaper.
---
see you in two weeks o7
---
&lt;3
---
Honestly? I think you're doing a disservice to all of the people who worked behind the scenes every year to put on the AT. And I don't just mean the presenters, but also the GMs, the camera &amp; board operators, etc. There are a lot of people at CCP who genuinely enjoyed doing the AT and gave up their free time to make it happen.
---
It's A-okay to be mad at CCP as a whole for this. But let's step back from the hyperbole.
---
Let’s just be glad a fight happened 
---
Actually excellently put.
---
I wouldn't mind that CCP got purchased by PA, that tiericde got postponed, that Fanfest was spread out bc of building renos, that the AT was canceled for a year so they can figure out a better way to do it... but all at once, and with nothing else to make me eager to log in, this is why we're seeing so much blind rage on the forums and reddit responses right now. People *want* to love this game, and CCP is just making it *so* *damn* ***hard***.
---
It should exist to  make everyone involved richer
---
"For instance, I was having to anchor my fleet in little tiny circles so that I could keep my logistics in range of disconnected pilots as they logged back in, and allow them to regroup with the fleet."  
---
Sounds like poor resource management and decision making, not something wrong with the game or servers.
---
BL will shoot everyone, but shoot goons first when there is a choice.
---
This is so sad. 
---
My biggest problem with this event is need to spend ISK to redeem the ticket for loot boxes. Effectively almost guaranteeing the drop to be ISK negative as most of the loot boxes contain less than 13 million or 25 million ISK required to get the box.
---
The sad thing is that this is pretty much 100% true 
---
I'll take ten
---
Never had much interest in the AT myself but I know it means a lot to some people and it's one of the few watchable competitive things EVE seems to have. It just seems like a really bad decision. 
---
1. Personal items go into asset safety, where you pay a % of it's value to recover them. Corp assets I'm unsure if they also go into safety or if they drop.
---
2. Yes and it's very common.
---
3. I wouldn't use someone elses structure
---
4. Yes, but it then opens you up to wars, and if you try to put it too close to Jita someone might want to blow it up. 
---
How about an upvote
---
Been playing 10 years and meh is my only response.
---
It's like reading yet another article about Mittens or Chribba.
---
Y'all remember the God damn 2010 AT "World Cup Mode" where they played vuvuzelas over the commentary? Cracked me up. There's been some great content from the AT over the years
---
Capital's are for sure balanced. Too bad there are so many mom's now that you can't jump into lowesec without getting hot dropped by two of them.
---
Much &lt;3 dude!
---
goon post
---
Let's just open up some mining sanctuaries and the people who like to mine can provide PLEX to rest of the community while the game slowly dies.
---
What if he left because this shit is too much even for him?
---
Code doesnt seem the type to use bounties considering they would know how useless it is. I dunno thos story sounds off to me
---
rip the tournament crest data o7
---
If you want I'll do screenshots later, I forgot who ordered it but they kept calling her a princess.
---
So the issue is that they aren’t giving away enough stuff?
---
That seems like an easy fix 
---
Indeed.  Good riddance to a boring event that maybe 2% of the EVE population actually enjoyed.
---
Like local chat system, AT will be offloaded.
---
You think he's representing the popular opinion on a website that literally shows the popular opinion by the click of a button....
---
Whew
---
It's a rewarding feeling to unsub all of the extra accounts. I just decided this past week to close down 5 out of my 6 accounts. 
---
Screw this whole building accelerator crap - just drop/make accelerators a reward!
---
Seems like this post got lost somewhere.
---
Fuck you to the Horde FC who tried to headshot my jackdaw twice, and failed twice!
---
It doesn’t have to be this huge thing I mean doesn’t the new player tutorial have like voiced comms and stuff from NPCs during certain parts of the mission? Things like that would be a really cool feature. It’s a space game we should have comms of whatever enemy we are facing talking shit to our ship. 
---
And it wouldn’t be expensive I guarantee they held a challenge for players to do voice overs there would be some actual talent that would do it for free. EVE players are insanely passionate. I could def do a couple characters myself

you didn't shoot the huginn.

normally it works... until there are 200 carriers on grid..

Great Post, Elise! 
---
I've just gotten back into everything so I'm catching up thanos for the info
---
So bitter that you won't do the very thing you really want ccp to do because fuck em! 
---
Lol
---
It was always a blast to watch and a fun thing to chat with corpmates about. Thank you. 
---
Sounds like an idea.
---
D:
---
That hasn't happened already?
---
&gt;Why were the NPC haulers that went from station to station removed?
---
because ccp never put loot inside of them that was worthwhile, so no one ever interacted with them.
---
&gt;Why is faction warfare still broken?
---
development costs money, something a $425 million company can't afford.
---
&gt;Why was faction standing taken out as requirement to place structures in empire space?
---
because what was the purpose of having it?
---
&gt;When are you finishing your module tiericide(or what ever the fuck its called)?
---
changing numbers and changing item names is hard okay, can't expect this company to do that.
---
&gt;What is CCPs goal with eve now?
---
milking
---
Why do you think I made this topic? I *want* to give them money, they're just not giving me and many others too many reasons anymore.
---
Hmm
---
Of course they don't reflect the whole playerbase, nothing does. It's just seemingly the straw that's broken the camels back for a lot of people.
---
ok

They would prefer the EVE_NT folks to run the whole event, but it's not logistically possible given the limited ability to share tournament tools (although this has *much* improved in previous years) and more importantly the large amount of cash prizes/and expectation of AT ship rewards that players have.
---
Last year CCP would have happily cancelled AT ship rewards, while letting EVE_NT handle the production, and let the AT run (and we'd probably still see the AT this year, although that of course is speculation.) But the playerbase rioted over the potential lack of AT ship prizes... which means CCP's best best, if they want to significantly change the format, is to cancel it entirely, and deal with the pain now in the AT off season (rather than as a surprise to teams that had already begun buying ships, acquiring AT ships of their own with expectation to win prizes, etc.) 
---
I'll have to keep this in mind if I ever run any more Abyss sites, hoping it's only a minute or so I'm out of the game. Probably already chop off 3 minutes from the timer just from that!
---
What a scoundrel.
---
Oh man, we've got a reddit badass here.
---
If you can make AT mobile platform some how CCP would be all over supporting it.
---
Wow, thanks for the amazing and thoughtful commentary. It's amazing you were able to put together such thoughts so eloquently.
---
They're not fixing their broken game, they're making promises on top of promises to fix their broken game, while killing the community events and not doing shit.
---
All the while pissing away all of their cash into failed projects and introducing as many macrotransactions as they can.  CCPearl Abyss, indeed.
---
no one cares about the pve fluff anyway
---
Hilmar's riding this straight into the ground and cashing out at his employees expense. 
---
Might have been an autocorrect thing. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I sometimes wonder where this game could’ve been if CCP didn’t try to make shit like Valkyrie, World of Werewolves and even that abomination of a shooter DUST. Like they just invested into EVE and chose innovation instead of regurgitation. Everything kinda changed when the walk-in stations never happened. That really would have opened up such a huge part of the game and created a lot of immersion 
---
But what if it's not only money they want to take?
---
super long range fighters... unless you jump a pile to 0 on a hostile keepstar, using them as glorified hics and tackle a pile of capitals with them.
---
With beer! And hookers! In fact forget the alliance tournament!
---
Every time this is played, an angel gets its wings.  
---
WHs are great. Wormholer btw
---
Thing is, I don't think its CCP's decision anymore. 
---
Best of luck o7 cant wait to see you again in a week.
---
Nobody cares enough to get you a timestamp lol he told you where to find the proof.
---
&gt; the 10% tidi fights with nothing actually on the line anymore are a waste of time
---
This is what killed it for me. I was, by and large, a happy f1 monkey, but it was fun because it felt like I was risking my ships/isk for, and that the other side was doing the same. SRP and arguably just the character age of the playerbase and their "generational" wealth means that no one risks anything anymore.  With the risk gone, the thrill of the fights goes too. 
---
Honestly the only reason I was sticking around, this is a sad day.
---
You're simply asking too much. 
---
A battleship is going to have to facetank it, you can do it but it's not going to be able to do it permanently.
---
If you bling the hell out of a Hyperion, with max skills and high-grade asklepians and drugs, you can perma tank 2.5k dps with a single repper and be cap stable under a single bhaalgorn heavy neut. Under 2 heavy neuts you'd last about 5 minutes. 
---
You'd also have very little dps and be spending more on your ship than the carrier. 
---
ccplz
---
The weight of billions of tons of ore (mined daily) killed it.
---
Nah, the AT can't be compared to the likes of NCAA or Superbowls in Eve, it's not like that - I don't care much about it but will stream some fights after all is done to see how it went down or which set of elites violated boundaries.
---
It's precisely what Avaren said, its abstract.
---
Some clown in corporate is looking at bottom lines but they don't teach these kind of dynamics @  Sungkyunkwan or Reykjavik University.  
---
You cannot install a clone if you don't have docking rights I believe.
---
wut?
---
The correct terminology in this case is “Jump Hictors”
---
We can have it at Eve Vegas! And there will be no computers involved. Drinking contest at any bar not at the Linq! No Linq bars because, face it, we can't get drunk on getting 1 drink every 3 hours with 2 bartenders.
---
All because eve-bet closed its doors.
---
zKill is amazing, but I get nervous that we really only have that one source right now. It's pretty much overdue for us to try and make a new one, if for no better reason than to have another source in the unfortunate event that zKill itself shits the bed and can't get up.
---
I tried crunching the numbers once, and it would be something obscene like $1000/month to shove it into a managed database. Some of the older KBs just saved the kill XML to disk and XSLT'd the shit out of it to get it on screen, then kept running indices for campaigns and ISK statistics.
---
... dear god, please don't give them ideas
---
@casperrr_24 
---
Hey AT was the thing that gave us some sence of hope for the GAME to actually once again be a game so ill leave this with this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-calvsGLRfs 
---
The amount of vibrant and thrive towards some sort of PVP with the majority of content creators alliance leaders rallying up their best, the sheer amount of transactions and planning.
---
So with that ill fade into my 9/9 M  Rank 5 wow Addiction
---
HAHAHAH that vid is epic, miss u bby!!
---
Where the fuck are all these doomsday panicky people coming from all of a sudden?
---
https://i.imgur.com/BTTjRZp.jpg Considering what it apparently looked like a few years ago I don't think there will be much left to identify it as Eve related. 
---
How experienced do you need to be to get into wormholing (considering I have a little pre-eve experience with wormholes, with my lady that is) I’m actually considering to give it a try a little later in my eve career as I get my skills a little higher
---
The permafrost event was the first I did and honestly I liked it. Got lots of cool stuff and enjoyed doing it. So being new to events, the permafrost event was awesome. This event, is a train wreck.  
---
I was wondering the same thing. There’s a solution to every problem, if CCP won’t give us content why don’t we as a community create our own content, it’s a sandbox mmo after all... it can be a little inconvenient, but people could adjust as they like
---
Why are you wasting your time, it’s obvious they dropped the ball on this event.
---
Wouldn't call it a giant battle. The south had no strategic objective other than have fun. We lost the isk war but so what? We're bringing content to eve. And I'm happy it we did it (minus the horde dude who put some pretty meh bubbles on the way home) 
---
Same here, am down to 1. I have been on 2 for quite a long while now, almost 2 years but now with this shit they're pulling am thinking I should just cancel the last one too. Have plex to reactivate if I ever want to, but right now am just not feeling even that.
---
Or PI that suddenly has a 10000% markup... Also i dont See any extra value for industry other then you have to do extra steps now and buy overprized materials
---
You're still the most charismatic leader in the game, I enjoy your posts a lot. I guess it's time to put on our rally caps and hope that CCP really does intend to bring back AT when balance issues are in check. 
---
Ark: Survival Evolved. 
---
Be ready to commit 60+ hours a week though, maybe not as much with the current rework of breeding but quiet a similar PvP rush
---
CCP should give all players max skills on the test server for a week at the same time around this tournament.
---
Can I have some of your stuff? 
---
What's your in-game name ?
---
No idea. But they need to go outside more.
---
I take 5. Takes me 2-3 minutes to completely restart my router and hardboot my computer and all that, then 1 minute to get back into the game etc. and last minute to actually fly from where it lands me to the gate, so 5 min.
---
My standard rule of thumb is to be done with all 3 rooms in less then 15 min. this also goes very well together with boosters, 4 filaments per booster then dock up to afk or whatever.
---
So T5s when I get an unlucky spawn can sometimes take me up to 17-18 minutes, this does not give me enough room for disconnects.
---
Bare minimum is 1. Be able to scan. 2. Data/relic analyzer if you're into that. 3. Cloak 4. BC/cruiser for lower class anoms. 
---
Querns : But A Cell in the Cancer Killing EVE
---
Loved watching it.
---
Sad to see what EvE has come to be.
---
Thank you for fun we had....
---
Jump hics are rorqs fit for combat not mining I know that might be strange to spodbrains. Supers with tackle are just supers with tackle.
---
Here we can see a csm member fulfilling his main role: white kniiting ccp. 
---
Permafrost was really bad because of the bright white on the over view, most the loot was bad but the frostline stuff was good, it wasn't a bad event by comparison to this one, but compared to their successes it was sub par.
---
Give me your in-game name and you shall have a part

&gt; CCP is an outsourced company, with a shrinking dev team, tighter monetary restrictions, and stricter monetary goals that must be reached, per the contractual agreement when they were bought by PA. 
---
Where did you get that from? Did they post the details of the contract somewhere?
---
You'll receive some of that as soon as I'm done 
---
Word. Enjoy your escape, friend.
---
Umm. Yes? I remember articles and posts from the acquisition pertaining to the revenue mandates made when Hilmar agreed to the buyout much to the speculation of people at the time.
---
https://youtu.be/RAA1xgTTw9w
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
Too bad you didnt sell you reddit account along with your eve toon.
---
I’m really enjoying the game right now, but am glad things are working out for you. 
---
I mean a dirty krab wouldnt enjoy a pvp tournament, that is pretty obvious.
---
Same as here. Bo Hunt
---
Dude just chill out and play some apex legends for a bit
---
The only real concern is who would be in control of the money, but I think we can find reputable people with black frog or some big public figure who wouldn't want to hurt the community by scamming it of good content.
---
You'll get some when I'm done 
---
May I partake in your stuffs? 
---
closer to 100
---
Same as the others, in-game name please 
---
Oh for real!? Bill Deburg. Don’t biomass just in case, my dude. 
---
Well, good luck in the Abyss, I lost a ship in a T3 a while ago due to bouncing and sorta stopped doing them. They're just so damn cool looking.
---
cheers for posting that. Massive.
---
That’s really awesome to hear, we’ve got something for everyone. 
---
Certainly you are asking the wrong questions.  
---
The only question worth answering is,  
---
"How cool would it look if the SDF1 punched an Erebus in the face"
---
Nah, I'm done for real. CCP won't have a single more cent from my pocket, and I've wasted way too much time.on this game, missed too many life opportunities. Fuck that. 
---
It's not really sudden, tho, to be fair. There's always been people predicting EVE's doom since day one.
---
I hate lootboxes
---
That is all
---
Can I have some of your stuff? Username Jackbeard Penguin
---
Man you’re putting thoughts in my head lol
---
Yeah remember that time in UALX where half the northern + TRI/SU forces titans DC’d when TAPI bosoned?
---
Don’t remember you complaining then. 😂
---
Capitals caused it. 
---
Can I have Some of your Things For safekeeping. My In game Name is "Daniel Chrono"
---
I won't tell you what to or what not to do. But as someone who spent a decade in New Eden, I can whole heartedly say you do not get that time back. You'll be ridiculed and mocked for quitting, especially since Eve has such a strong hold on people. Just make sure if you do truly quit, you quit for the right reasons otherwise you will go back to it. 
---
Uninstall already and go outside and look at the giant light orb in the sky
---
Sounds awesome!
---
I biomassed on February 25th of last year and uninstalled actually. It actually is really cold and rainy outside right now : ) 
---
Will send some when I'm done 
---
The only things I recall about the revenues was that they'd get certain bonuses to the base purchase price if they reached certain profit levels. That's hardly something that "must be" reached. More like incentives to do well.
---
In fact CCP very much described them as "investors" rather than "owners", and were very clear the actual operation of CCP and the development of EVE were still completely under their own control.
---
How that translates to "tighter monetary restrictions" and a "shrinking dev team" doesn't really add up to me. Seems like if they wanted to increase their profits they'd invest some of their new funds into expanding their operation and trying to improve everything.
---
Nope. The issue isnt with the krabs &amp; carebears, they always were and always will be krabs and carebears. The issue is that the krabs and carebears are basically all thats left, because the game heavily penalizes ALL other gameplay styles these days.
---
Pics or it didn't happen.
---
I don't give a flying a fuck about what the community is thinking of it 
---
Will do
---
There are alot of angry and bitter people right now, not that I blame them. You build an entire identity around Eve, and it's not one so easy to let go of. If you get enjoyment in Eve rock on! The post I made mainly pertained to frustrated people who have sunk years into the game and may be feeling a bit empty and angry.
---
Thank You.
---
It is a tremendous amount of work for players to do without any direct control of the playfield.  Ask eve nt
---
Buy yourself 5 t1 explorers and go turn that 10mil into a quick 500mil
---
You're such a brainlet lmfao, go feed your kittens
---
What if... we balanced capitals by cost....
---
My first carrier in 2014 would be equivalent to somewhere between \~6-10b today depending on how you calculate it.
---
extract everything. sell all assets. RMT out. 
---
You seem to think people participated in the AT just for the prizes and nothing else. The prizes were nice but it was the camraderie in teams, the practices, competitiveness, and theorycrafting that most players that participated looked forward to each year. 
---
Not everything is about ISK, my dear Goon friend.
---
Industrialist route - Get a venture, mine a bit, sell the ore and grow
---
PVE route - buy a ship, get the fittings, run sites or do missions
---
My advise is to do missions, grow your standings and your isk and upgrade ships 
---
Think they can still be found through some googling
---
Sadly we can look to shrinking dev teams as well as the lack of balance focus, or quality of life improvements to see that this clearly isn't the case. What we're sold and what is the truth are totally different in evidence and practice. The shelving of the AT, is yet another one of those "we promise" moments that knowing CCP's track record is probably not going to bode well for the AT's future, let alone any future improvements to pvp or balance focus itself.
---
obvious bait post
---
Fair enough bud, just letting you know that some of us are still loving it after 15years. I enjoy it more now that I can only play an hour or two a day compared to back at uni when I would no life it for 8hours. The game is definitely different, but I think it’s also what you make it. I’m not as invested, so it doesn’t hurt me as much ))
---
I truly wish you all the success and future happiness in whatever and wherever life takes you. 
---
I suspect that the pressure from PA came in the form of the layoffs. This was based on rumours and I can’t verify, but:
---
If PA forced CCP to fire it’s community team and staff then eve is done for
---
Thanks, appreciated. I'll try and make the most of it. 
---
\&gt;ccp makes 10 bad decisions in a row causing the worst pcu since 2007 despite massive reasons for a much higher pcu
---
\&gt;the entire community hates what they've done
---
\&gt;but guys, they konw what they're doing
---
I actually have a venture already as I decided to take the career agent path and have also started mining a little. I think I can figure out what ship to get down the line but what do you mean fittings? I know that’s the stuff you put on your ship but I’m not entirely sure what it all actually is.
---
Give Lutris a try. It's a simpler playonlinux system that can have individually installed instances of WINE and its configurations 
---
You can then have EVE just run DXVK without it affecting other settings. You can also run Winetricks on that individual install and such too. It's all a part of the Lutris launcher
---
Doing all of that but the RMT part. 
---
Kindly Send your expensive stuff and wallet to AxleTc OTW    I will double your use and send it back

I don’t think I’m gonna do anything like that quite yet, I don’t know enough of what I’m doing.
---
Sorry to disappoint?
---
Aw I really enjoyed this story, thanks for posting!
---
It’s a great way of learning mechanics of the game I highly suggest it
---
The balance between life and gaming is a tricky one for sure. For some of us, myself included, the pull was just too great : ) 
---
Man the game sure is different, even from a year ago I'd imagine. Walking away as invested as I was, really was a hard choice to make. Glad you are still enjoying the game after so long : )
---
Dude just quit already. 
---
To do this, you need the buy in of the largest coalitions in the game, and significant infrastructure in place in relevant systems.  You'd need dead end systems with a gate that can be hell camped, and even then it would be hard to stop nullified gangs from getting in and messing with the results.  I question the ability of players to run anything at the same scale that the AT does without even more issues of cheating that the AT normally has.
---
What is a t1 explorer then? Haven’t heard of it and I just assumed it was a ship
---
When I took a break from EVE, it was a welcome relief at first but I eventually resubbed because I missed the thrill of PvP and other games just bored me. If you still have stuff to give, my ingame character is Luscius Uta. Enjoy your life without EVE o/
---
They literally released a batch of Quality of Life improvements this week. What the hell are you on about?
---
The chat changes - despite it's many *many* hiccups - is to me a clear indication they are planning for the future; replacing outdated features with newer versions. So is the upcoming 64bit client - In my experience as a developer, corporations only looking to maximize profits don't go through such infrastructure changes on their codebase.
---
Balance changes are - and have always been - an ongoing long-term thing. In 2018 they made several balance changes that very much changed the ongoing metas and improved versatility in fleet setups. There have been several balancing tweaks in the last few months. - I'm not sure exactly what you are expecting out of these, but if you are claiming there have been none, you are sadly mistaken.
---
It seems to me you have very much lost touch with what's been happening, and are just throwing out ill-informed claims to support your doom predictions. Those of us actually paying attention know better.
---
This video explains it pretty well
---
https://youtu.be/N2nlgi83SN4
---
In highsec it is relatively safe and once you feel comfortable you can move into null or wormhole space!
---
Ok you’ve convinced me
---
PA doesn't give a flying fuck about the players, no amount of emails or petitions will do anything.
---
Look at BDO, nothing changed really, whales can still whale, people quit the game that didn't want to spend $20 on an outfit that gave you an advantage over X player doing the same activity. 
---
They only want to see money out of EVE. Whether its plex sales, smashing as many skins into the game as possible, or lootboxes. 
---
What I'm looking forward to, though, is what CCP will do at these evemeets around the world. If it's not something ground breaking that will shake the game up, I'll be sad. There's nothing else like EvE.
---
It's licenced to Sumo. CCP isn't developing it.
---
Forgot youtube was a resource I had lol, thanks I’ll check it out.
---
But t1 frigates and get blown up a lot.
---
rip

Toss me some of your ships, I'll hold them in case you ever come back.

---
Can I be on the team? I promise I'll boundary violate :)
---
6ish months till classic WoW, that's all i gotta say
---
To sum up this entire post in a succinct and time efficient matter. This event fucking sucks and CCP should feel bad for thinking it was a good idea.
---
&gt;The end game if we are going to keep EVE running is the complete purge of current management  
---
lol, right.
---
&gt;You can't put a price tag on keeping the SPIRIT of your game alive. 
---
Some bean counter: "Hold my Quafe"
---
They should just continute to develop the niche/complex/tactical/strategy side of the game (which is why we all play Eve).
---
Not log in do instanced pve/pvp and get a pink looking skin and log out.
---
Would you mind throwing some of that wealth at Dave Yognaut?
---
Yea there was a point for me when the balance was way, way off. I’ll probably follow you at some point but not.quite.yet ) Take it easy bud
---
This indeed. I know it's just my bad luck, but i've traded tickets for around 10 boxes so far (standard and VIP), and lost isk on every single trade. 
---
Haven’t checked out the event or payed much attention to the reeee threads, but this makes it sound like they fucked up big time. 
---
Touché xD 
---
Rutger Hauer wrote that the day they shot the scene. It wasn't part of the script. The director loved it enough to shoot it. One of my favorite movie scenes. 
---
PA added purple skins and eyeshadow.  
---
Next event- Hello Kitty Manticores and Catgirl ear drops.  
---
PSSSST... PA.... we're a breed of basement-dwelling nerds that DON'T dedicate their lives to your garbage waifu-simulator BDO.... so if you could stop doing shit catered to that... then that would be great...  
---
Dont worry, the whole event is broken. 
---
Well ...
---
The spreadsheet macro pivot blackbelt dick measure off will be postponed until the iron throne is returned to its rightful owner. 
---
This is an MMO right? if you dont want to mine let other mine for you. and you can just buy the ore required. 
---
Good riddance.
---
Thanks for sharing, I cried. 
---
Truly an event to sink your ~~teeth~~ ISK into
---
Probably won't mean much without the prizes tbh. I don't see people training for months. 
---
There whole argument about getting rid of community engagement is that it saves money...So to save money they are going to hold a half dozen events around the world and pay to ship their staff around the globe instead of a single event where attendees travel to meet them? Yeah that totally sounds cheaper.
---
Enjoy!
---
Right.
---
This is some crazy shit!! You don't even have to run your own tournament. People will run it for you and yet you still say "NO screw you no pvp tournament for you!" gg
---
Bless
---
What’s this spod you speak of?
---
Please Judy its not like you ever concentrated really on it while you were busy stuffing your face with frozen burgers.
---
AT analyst btw.
---
It was good to hear Falcon say what he said tonight. I really hope to see it come back in 2020.
---
I'm sorry to inform you...
---
Your son has gone full spod brain. There's nothing we can do for him now. 
---
My deepest condolences.

Haha, that's pretty cool. Season 3 alone should have made it the biggest sci-fi show of the era but lol puppets I guess...

---
Enjoyed it and obviously you did too, well played.
---
If you can convince them that doing what you want will make them more money(happier community=more subs)
---
They will change stuff. I really think letters are a good idea
---
&gt;Sure it's avoidable. Just invade the wormhole and kill the DDing Titan. See you have all the tools you need to do it but you don't want to.
---
funny how you of all people say that "just kill it" is a defense against something. Weren't you the one claiming that killing an umbrella is no option? :D
---
&gt;Oh you can avoid it. Use your citadels to avoid them by being inside of them.
---
Lol, "DOCK UP". See how you would make eve a less active game if you were in charge? :)
---
&gt;You are the one making the accusation I just want to hit PvE'ers. I'll take any target. I'm not picky. I support mechanics that make it so there's no such thing as a "pve ship." All ships should be bit capable of PvPing.
---
Then again, why would you need to have krabs be more vulnerable to you without local? It's evident that a less safe space means less activity in general (where is your conclusion to the numbers btw?) and by all means, removing local will make space less safe. 
---
&gt;1 ISK is not "no value." Nice try.
---
I loled. :) 
---
&gt;Delve is hugely populated and as such more things die there. (Also Goons are pretty bad.) None of this backs your argument that "cheaper ships means more pvp."
---
Sure it does - the most active PvE region, the most active PvP region. It's evident for me. Since I still have no conclusion of your own, well, it's what I go with. Since you failed to adress my question for your conclusion about the numbers, well - there is no argument here. 
---
&gt;You haven't established your claim that PvPers don't want pvp.
---
No, I haven't. PvP'ers do every single second though. Where are all the attacks on structures? If PvP'ers wanted real PvP, they would try to force it by attacking the things they can always attack. 
---
Actions my friend, actions. What happens in the game (or rather: what doesn't happen) clearly show: you are lying about your side of the argument. Your words don't matter. PvP'ers, for the majority, want easy kills and thats fine really, if that's the prefered playstyle then so be it. 
---
I have no quarrels with that but trying to suggest change with the assumption of it being any different, well... 
---
&gt;But all this time you said that everyone has the tools to do this. Now they don't?
---
CCP gave them tools, they can't/don't want to afford them. More clear? 
---
&gt;Yeah dude let me kill a Rorqual with a destroyer and two cruisers. 
---
Thanks for proving my point about not wanting to use adequate tools for the job. :) 
---
&gt;Who said anything about just hunting PvE'ers?
---
It's what Elite PvE'ers do and it's the goal of removing local. Hunt more PvE'ers, remove the chance to escape for them with the only way of getting out being "ask for help". Just that in your case: "Claim the reason is aiming at more PvPer vs PvPer fights". Which is laughable as evident from the discussion. 
---
&gt;lol you krabs grind, die to us and replace your losses. You keep doing it. We'll keep killing you. I have no problems with this arrangement.
---
Yes exactly. That's one way why PvE encourages PvP. A krab that hasn't made back his money won't be out there after a gank anymore. Less PvE. Less PvP. 
---
A crab that doesn't have the money to PvP beause it's more likely that he will get caught will krab less. That means he makes less money, that means he can afford less losses and it means he can go less on PvP fleets on his own. 
---
The result of that is: Less targets for you to kill. Less PvE means less PvP. Less safe PvE = less PvE. 
---
I am not sure how you can still ignore these simple truths about Eve Online. 
---
If CCP sees their game dying they will just try to milk it harder before it dissapears for good. Expecting them to fix anything is pointless at the moment.
---
You mention that it’s not a way to attract new players. I know this is anecdotal so it probably only accounts for a very very small % of players but I only started playing because of AT. 
---
I came from a “traditional” esports background (LoL, SC2, csgo). I had tried eve before but inevitably got burnt out after a few days of hisec mining and god knows how many years later I saw a link for alliance tournament XV on YouTube which instantly got me intrigued.
---
Due to the hours I was awake (autz rip) I couldn’t catch many games though I was always seeing Brave Newbies games, just by chance and obviously went for the “underdog” story (if it was that in reality idk but having newbies in your name makes it kinda default).
---
That AT brave made a fantastic run iirc into the top 8 with a lot of focus going onto logi pilot Yukiko Kami who also made an appearance on stream as he was in the area (for csm?).
---
Watching the “underdogs” perform in that format was the sole reason I created a new account and joined brave and while I took a hiatus from playing shortly after joining (jumping on comms for newbros is haaaaaard), I became truly active close to 12 months ago as a logistics pilot I would like the narrative to say it was following the footsteps of my first role model in the game in Yuki but it was a natural role for someone who has plays support/healer roles as a preference in other games.
---
I loved the format that was run in the AT and how excited you were about different strats (octodad, tinker etc) which got explained well enough to know how each fight would go down. Even though I didn’t know how memey(ballsy?)the drake set-up was (navy drakes are boss btw) I loved that element despite having no clue about any of the ships being used (I was active for 3 months before learning AT was subcaps only...I thought drakes were bad capitals until i saw people using them.)
---
Come last AT it was amazing having standing all cram in comms and watch and get excited when we played win or loss. I’ll cherish that time we used the cancerous ecm comp to great effect or yuki burning all of the things to save his oneiros (?) and am certainly going to miss that atmosphere of us being a “team” as it were.
---
Ultimately I’m not going to leave because AT is gone cause I now have my own story to forge within and outside this pixel galaxy no matter how small and inconsequential it is with my own friends I can talk shit to and fly alongside as my escape from life. You can however rest assured that eve would be -1 pilot if it wasn’t for AT.

They actually do place bounties. The mark of James is 315315
---
Hows about a wormhole? (sounds stupid, but why not?)
---
This is where it turns out that Garbage has some specific use that makes it the most valuable item in the game and we just aren't thinking outside the box.
---
Right here [https://secure.eveonline.com/](https://secure.eveonline.com/)
---
Then you can keep swiping it moar 4 Rorquals and moar plex !!!!!!! So u can be elite and multibox. Then swipe even moar and get ISBoxer installed and keep forgetting to shut it off. If they come ban u, u just say u forgot and they unban u andif anyone says anything the CSM will come and bail u out on forums cuz they will say no evidenze of cheatNg and Nu PlayzTyle and cuz of zanDbox.
---
Swipe moar !!!
---
&gt;Now I'm not for one second saying that none  of that is true, what I am saying is that it doesn't fucking matter, or  at least shouldn't.
---
You. Are. Wrong. 
---
Yes, EVE is a sandbox. But it's a sandbox within the constraints and rules that the game imposes. Taking a silly extreme position to illustrate, let's say that tomorrow CCP makes a change to the PANIC module which allows Rorqual's to cyno out while PANIC'd. In fact it's so great that during panic it ignores jump cap requirements and you can cyno out with even zero cap. Oh, and now all capital class ships can fit PANIC modules, not just Rorquals. 
---
Clearly making cap's completely invincible would profoundly change the game. Yes it's still a "sandbox", but CCP has the ability to warp the rules of it to render it almost completely unrecognizable from it's current form. Yes you'd be able to still play a "sandbox" game within those warped rules, but you can't tell me it doesn't have an influence because players can still do "whatever they want". 
---
Citadel mechanics, PANIC modules, Cyno Inhibs, Asset Safety, Anomaly Respawn Rates, SOV mechanics are all less extreme example of the rules I took to the extreme above. Consistently CCP has been taking a "making things less dangerous" approach in most of their decisions, and in a lot of people's opinion's it's killing the game. The most frustrating thing is that CCP is also not revealing what direction they want to go with the game. Is this what they actually intend and their vision for future EVE is a lot more casual version that it's traditionally been? Is it just a series of misguided changes that have had a cumulative effect that they didn't realise? Is it a conflict between management and the developers who have different priorities? (i.e. making a 'great game' vs 'subscription numbers'). We really don't know, and it's frustrating as hell having the uncertainty surrounding it. The less and less we hear as changes like this take place, the more the community is feeling helpless that our feedback will actually have an impact. Is this the way EVE will continue to go? Please just tell us if so in order for some of us to simply quit already.
---
I looked into BDO I’m confused. Why does everyone say it’s screwed? What did the devs do?
---
Its weird. I couldn't help but hear your Text-to-Speech voice in my head narrating as I read this...
---
I'm btw btw 
---
Get all the hardcore AT guys to quit the game and then run it last minute so it's just a bunch of AT noobs flying in it? 
---
This guide is to teach you to set up a VPN running by yourself step by step. Not a ad for buy a VPN service. The self managed VPN can help you with many online game network issues.
---
Didnt you quit eve? Can you actually quit please? Thanks
---
+1 on this
---
I agree with both of you. I think all of this recent actions with ccp as being owned by pa is making people uncertain. In a game like eve when, like OP said, you play it for years and build a identity around it uncertainty is the last thing that player wants. However, I think the QOL idea from ccp is great and headed in the right direction. 
---
I think the anger and frustration is more because the uncertainty of the future and what is going to be done about top issues. Imo: botting, balance passes, phasing pos's fully out and god only know what's going to happen when they burn that code.
---
 The eve community and ccp are at odds, (shocker I know) even I sometimes wonder, what the hell are these event sites, what's the thought process with two carriers in one site and shit rewards? Wheres the AT, have they even put why they havent done it? Wheres the acual fun stuff ccp use to do that really connected and maintained the relationship with devs and general players. Is this the new norm or a simple  disconnect that's happening because they are working so hard on backend problems? 
---
I doubt PA made them, CCP wanted to cut easy costs. It was obvious for a long time CCP were dressing themselves up for investors.
---
If this is truly the ignoble whimper of and end to the AT, at least I got to fight in the last one. And by fight I mean get stomped in two consecutive matches. Makes me appreciate not chickening out because we were too afraid of looking bad on stream.
---
lol @ people who still think that doctrine was his idea.
---
So he shouldnt because we both know you wont?
---
You have official forums which don't have all this bitching, might try them instead of /r/eve.
---
If you don't want a toxic enviroment you've come to the wrong sub my dude.
---
If StainGuy ever gives up on his gate we know eve is truly dead.
---
&gt; Why were the NPC haulers that went from station to station removed?
---
Uhh, they're still there. I just saw one Monday night, in fact.
---
I am not doing the event anymore. The event is effectively become a lottery event layered on the top of normal PVE to create ISK sink. Not my cup of tea. Players who like to gamble with their ISK may enjoy it though... CCP is bringing back IWantISK in disguise
---
Most of those events are player run events that ccp are just gate crashing.
---
It's probably cheaper to send a few devs to a pub I  another country than to rent Harpa for half a week.
---
Today I updooted an Olmeca post.
---
And I just heard someone complain that the issue was crappy PVE. It feels like we’re all demanding deferent things
---
Why does it have to be done through ccp? Why not harnes the number one resource of Eve? The dedication of Eve players are second to none and I'm sure there are people / alliences willing to make a player ran alliance tournament. Ran by the players for the players. 
---
You think the clicking of a button shows the popular opinion..... Whew lad
---
Remember how wormholers had to take one for the team.... This is the entire eve player base taking one for the team...
---
That has a lot to do with how CCP has let the entire game fall apart. Pretty much everything needs work at this point. PVE is in the toilet, small and medium gang PVP is in the gutter, cap balance is a non-existent joke, no one in null actually likes the current version of sov warfare and faction warfare has been a running joke/meme since 2011.
---
Who are you
---
Hey bro, I'm not here to ask for your stuff I just want to wish you well in your journey no matter where it may lead you. I too have taken many breaks across the years , before you do anything rash and biomass your character, take a moment and store some things and ISK away you never know if one day like me you want to return for a short stint as time and RL will allow you.
---
Aren't jokes supposed to be fun?
---
By we, you mean some one other than yourself?
---
If not,  why ask? Just do it.
---
I said something to the same affect on another thread earlier. I'm waiting for the down voted.
---
I'm willing to bet Eve vegas alone is close to the cost of fanfest in iceland given vegas prices for convention centers. there is no way the whole world tour is cheaper than half a week in their home city.
---
The PVE has always been crappy, thats why CCP focusing on it at the expensive of the rest of the game is not worth it. Because all the PVE they ever released gets solved and becomes a grind (incursions for example). Even with abyssals players have now figured it out and its become mostly a grind. MMO's all have to have grindy PVE and EVE is no different. PVE was never the draw of EVE. Rather it was its one-of-a-kind hardcore sandbox nature that was the main draw. EVE was uniquely a place where the story is driven by meaningful player and group conflicts in an open universe, where the hardcore perma-loss nature of the game made everything highstakes and thus captivating.
---
Given they just got sold to the king of not giving a fuck what customers think something like this is probably an empty gesture even if it was organized and pulled off.
---
Because what real incentives are left for people to go out and PvP?
---
I haven't had a reason to seek out PvP for a good while.
---
only when CCP isn't the one telling them.
---
CCP let Theomachy run something special on the test servers; should be possible to put something together, and maybe even have CCP-forced sequestering of the teams.
---
The reason the AT is taken so seriously is the 13 figure prize pool. First prize of 3-4 trillion ISK, with 2nd and 3rd getting prizes of ~1T.
---
Remove that and it will not be taken as seriously. 
---
the AT Always was one of the stable pillars of the game.
---
take that away and the very foundation will be shaking a Little more then before.
---
we know how it all ends.
---
time to look for the next game
---
@ CCP: Maybe make a "NO AT THIS YEAR LOL"  SKIN ?  you could sell it for the entry fee of the Tournament. It could show a raised middle finger or a dickface.
---
BTW I wonder how much the World Tour will cost CCP and what logic justified it over fixing the damn game. A swan song.
---
I unsubbed most if my accounts a long time ago.
---
Subs probably aren't that much revenue vs the plex people buy which are traded in for skins, mcts, and omega time.
---
They've listened to it before, I think we can do it again. There's still devs who care at the company, a showing of unity like we did before might make them be able to stand up to the higher ups as the community would be behind them
---
To be honest, why not make it about solo pvp and skill? Get like 300 popular pvpers, etc, Start everyone an equal amount of jumps away from a target system. Everybody gets one ship, say cruiser sized, and they have to gather points from certain areas on the map. They can kill to earn more points or hide to try and win it all. But the goal would be to reach the sun of the system in question and hold the location(50km from the vontainer for) 10 minutes. When that's been achieved the game is over and the person with the most points wins. 
---
This is the message i left for CCP as my unsub reason:
---
My In game identity is Tel'Kontar and I am the CEO of The Grey Eagles, a 200+ man wormhole corp. In watching the direction the game has taken over the last few years, it has become very clear that CCP has decided that EVE is to become a casual PVE-focused economics simulator rather than the high-risk PVP-filled, shake-inducing sandbox it used to be. Skill injectors, rorqs, capital application to subs, infinite anoms, lack of pvp or balance updates, constant shit PVE content like abyssals and events has clearly shown that you do not care for the core players that keep EVE running. By this I mean the dedicated, borderline-autistic content creators (like myself) that keep the game filled with content and the living story of EVE going. They also make the game experience of all your other customers so much better. I will resub the day the old fiery risk-filled EVE i knew returns, until then I will bid the krabs adieu o7
---
Wasn't Garbage used in Booster production?
---
There is a fix.
---
Relog.
---
About 20 times. I spent about 30 mins chain relogging last night after some one suggested it. It was a ball ache but it did work.
---
I’m new as well and having a great time, the bitching doesn’t bother me one bit
---
They should use it as a case study in business schools. "How to build a product that captures a unique, uncontested market niche then piss it all away".
---
i havent played eve for years, but did for over 6 years. i always watch the AT.
---
Now they cancel it for "Balancing" what is that supposed to mezn? They dont have the time or what? WTF is wrong with CCP?
---
Have you seen the price of... just about anything, in Iceland?
---
Fanfest is my shortest and most expensive holiday for the last 2 years.
---
Can I have your stuff ? 
---
While I know people love being competitive, when year after there is widespread issues with match fixing, collusion and cheating(which CCP has to devote extra resources to stamp out). Add in the insane amount of isk that a team has to come up with to fund its campaign (I have heard up to 1 trillion isk) and then the general douche-baggery players that comes with running such a high-level tournament, it is no wonder that this is the case. It practically signed its own death warrant. 
---
Kinda sad, but after all that I actually enjoyed staying up late to watch it. You would see a level of devotion in the AT that you wouldn't see anyway else and quite often it wasn't about the isk either. 
---
Squizz has an api endpoint on zkill that lets you dump the id and hash for every kill. You'd lose the prices zkill assigned to each kill but otherwise thats all you need to completely replicate the database.
---
If you told me back in 2012 that in 2016 and 2019 i would come to miss a csm runned by themitani ibwould have said that i'll eat my toenails clippings from a cup if that ever happened.
---
The csm back in 2012 was at the front of the protest. 
---
The current csm is proving to be worse than useless and i bet that's why ccp isn't risking a new csm election. 
---
Then you haven't priced out Toronto. Holy fuck, it's almost as much for the weekend as I spent on either of my trips to Reykjavík.
---
They don't just send a few devs at least to Vegas, it's a lot of people. 
---
Nothing CCP does will save eve, its the players that ruined it. They do nothing but spin ships and when they have to pvp they blob.
---
Why not both? 
---
Ingame Styggs, in case you have a soft heart and a big wallet :D
---
BDO is an ocean made for whales lol. My irl friend spends over 1000-2000 a month trying to max out his gear with awful rng enchanting. Apart from that, BDO has no content. The combat is amazing yes, the PVP is usually massive zergs with 2-3 people simultaneously doing aoes and killing 10-15 other players, 1v1 - 3v3 can be really fun. But other than the occasional pvp and the mindless grind, there’s nothing to do, no dungeons no raids.. It’s a game with potential, but it’s shit atm.
---
What’s sov warfare and what’s wrong with faction warfare? Sry I’m new
---
Do you live in Iceland? Because I'm not talking about the price to players/customers as CCP is not paying their tab to travel to Iceland, stay there and attend fan fest. I am talking about the price to CCP to hold the event. There is no way that reserving and using one conference center for a few days a short trip from headquarters is more expensive than a half dozen events all around the world including a week end in vegas from CCP's point of view. It may be cheaper for the players but that was not the point falcon was making on talking in stations this evening, he continually referred to the cost to CCP itself as the reason why things like the AT were put off for a year.
---
I like the difficulty of the sites especially the VIP sites, but their rarity is making the event a no-go for me in null where I live, plus the drops I've had so far have been a fraction of the 13 m it costs me each time. So all in all it's a complete fail of an event. Utterly garbage.
---
"They've listened to it before"  
---
They weren't owned by a loot box obsessed company that just spent half a billion dollars to buy them last time.
---
" There's still devs who care at the company " 
---
Its pretty clear at this point that its the bean counters and not the devs that make the calls at this point, go read some of the reviews from past employees if you don't believe me.
---
Can I has ur stuff ??
---
Newbie here, as I can see you’re giving out stuff if I can have a mil or two would be nice.. Jay Dellacorte , thanks in advance, if there’s anything left that is :)
---
Sure just shoot his citadel ... unless he keeps most of his stuff in higsec ....
---
Subs don't matter when it's free to play now, also Plex/skin sales make a good profit.
---
Screw CCP, cant we make our own AT? i ghave not played eve for years thats why i ask.
---
I mean star citizen for example has not even the infrastructure for such events and their community is able to pull of their own events almost every weekend. From Races to PVP and PVE events, this community already did so much, then i think it can do a PVP event without CCP too.
---
sov warfare is a days if not weeks long process required to take control of even a single nullsec based system using mechanics that no one likes. And faction warfare is an isk farmers dream that has been largely abandoned by the groups that used to play it because of a complete lack of upkeep by CCP.
---
Upkeep?
---
Welcome to /r/eve, where everyone has different opinions within a spectrum between "everything is fine" to "REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE". 
---
  INB4 someone blames fozziesov for the AT cancelling 
---
Elasticsearch isn't really the tool for the job here. It excels at full text search whereas a killboard is mostly interested in filtering on normalised fields or aggregates.
---
sad thing is, if they cant see a direct impact by numbers or what ever metric, no one will give a fuck. 
---
at least you didn't get a 10 year timer on your next goal like the other guy who posted today.
---
Depends on your skills, where you're located, and other factors. In general, don't worry about where to spend it. When the time comes, it will be obvious -- everything from skill books to ships and mods.
---
I recommend doing the career agents to get a feeling for which direction you want to take your character.
---
Icelander here, Harpa is actually getting renovations done this spring/summer.
---
And yes it’s ridiculous, that building is a national embarrassment and should be torn down rather than shovel more taxpayer money into that raging dumpster fire. I don’t give a fuck that it’s our only proper opera hall either, fuck those too.
---
No. Eve is free to play- Biomass and delete your accounts.
---
What should they change/add to make it more fun?
---
Cpt Soban
---
Theyre even bleeding whales tho. Source: am whale, unsubbed last year.
---
I’ve been doing one career agent so far, a bit over half way done with him and so far it’s doing ok. I ended up spending some on ship mods and thought about buying a really expensive ship(for me) but decided against it for the time being.
---
New groups already have easy access to Stain, its called jump freighters. All they need to do is not be red to CVA and use their citas from amarr to stain. 100% safe. People just dont want to do it.
---
Please no lowest gate to Venal, the isolation is actually a plus.
---
If this is actually what you think about this stuff please leave the CSM because you're wasting everyone's time
---
You'll be back when everyone moves onto the new hot topic in this sub. Probably laughing at TEST again. 
---
even after they fixed the bugs they released with it, the event is still a complete shit show.
---
We should have a mandatory positivity week on /r/eve  **(◕‿◕✿)** 
---
You may want to consider just putting everything on hold for a while, and using your assets to cover the monthly PLEX.
---
If you decide to go ahead, don't forget to extract your skills.
---
And if you have any extra isk or stuff you don't want to bother selling, feel free to send it to Warren Aideron in-game.
---
I agree with you, but i doubt CCP bother about your unsubbing accounts.
---
I was on a fun roam 2 weeks ago in a fleet of 15+ people all in frigates and destroyers. As soon as we got into a fight 7 of us (including me) disconnected immediately and it took ages to get back in. It was just localized to members in the US either. We had 2 of our Euro buddies get dced aswell. Wasn't the first time it had happened to me but it's the first time that I saw it happen in a fleet with only 25 people in local. Now it's starting to affect our alliences level ops because there is always some people that DC on both side of the fight as soon as it starts. 
---
My EvE vet friends tell me that they end never the DC problem be this bad.  I wonder if people are using DDoS or something.
---
Arbitrator does well in L1-Abysses ;)
---
You do know theyre doing like 10 fanfests this year right?
---
Good
---
"massive windfalls"? It's pretty shit isk/hour if you consider the time, effort and isk invested by the winning teams.
---
There was a lot of that, but I also remember having fun skirmishes in those NS entrances as well
---
Shhhh. Ccp is busy balancing the game doesn't have the time for puny bugs that'll fix themselves when the event is over anyways
---
Not to defend ccp here but I for one am looking forward to a 64-bit client. 
---
That is a big deal and will go a long way to addressing the horrible client side instability in big fights. 
---
The 32-bit client can’t address enough memory to keep up with everything on screen in big fights, so we get black screens and crashing to desktop. 
---
It’s not the same tho is it, it’s micro meetings with the same price attached, you get the die hard but why go to Vegas when you can just go to London and vice versus. I was gona go to my first fan fest and a nice vacation to Iceland now it just might be Vegas who knows. It’s disappointing and it s a publicity stunt 
---
Not much chance I'll be in Vegas this year, so you'll have to go it alone against security. Just don't get a weapons timer near them and you'll be fine.
---
Remember, they never had a problem with IWantISK, just towards the end they had a problem with the RMT it hid. i.e. they cared once they knew for sure someone else made money from it.
---
However, also remember that much of the player base including RIGHT HERE ON REDDIT, didn't have a problem with things like Somerblink even though it was the exact same thing as a loot box for in game cash. They only found it easy to bitch about it once CCP implemented it.
---
Lol i predicted it wouldnt happen this year.. i've also stopped playing this year......
---
Coincidence?
---
Nope...games gone to shit tbqh.
---
I quit awhile back, but I've got a couple gems sitting on a toon or two. Can someone tell me what this means for AT ships price wise? Have they been skyrocketing since there won't be anymore such hulls coming into the game?
---
So, new to eve and wants to change how everyone else does things. I think we found a new ccp employee.
---
https://updates.eveonline.com/
---
They are koreans, so it might be reasonable to assume so.
---
What if one of the bugs means it never ends?!
---
This is only the 93rd post on this topic. Keep it up! Only 7 more until we hit 100!!!!!!
---
Your allowed to be pissed I just think it’s hurting new players to have the eve redit be 70% bitter vets and only 30% how to play and have fun in the game
---
Oh look, another one. No one cares, can I have your stuff?
---
Then they'll probably fix it after tiericide is done. 
---
whew someone got upset
---
10/10 troll 
---
Its bigger and better than a single fanfest in iceland. This argument is total bull and you know it. The fact these events are around the globe make it more accesible to people who cant afford to travel to iceland for the meetups. Its gonna be big. But hey, dont look at the bigger picture because of me, please keep drinking that vinegar.
---
There is a lot of bad stuff this week, but this is not one of them.
---
Wow, 2 posts from same guy on same subject. HE IZ SUPR SIRIUS GYZZ!
---
Again, can I have your stuff?
---
Wow.
---
..
---
You get it. 
---
Even though american football is trash, you get it.
---
The AT WAS a thing that actually attracted eve players like news storys about huge wars once upon a time. Now eve is a dying cash cow, if you dont believe it, you aint fucking played long enough to remember when it was good. Or you enjoy being milked like a cow, except its money not delicious milk.
---
It aint good now. Your wrong. No argument you make can change it ohhhshiney skin loot box etc etc rorqual.
---
Morons.
---
&gt; ~~One of~~ ***M***y favorite movie scene~~s~~. 
---
Fixxed.
---
OP, enjoy your victory, tho I fervently wish it is short termed and some miracle pulls Eve out of its downward spiral and forces you back to our terrible, hated, dearest company.
---
With hookers and blackjack!
---
' I am the CEO of The Grey Eagles, a 200+ man wormhole corp '

*who..?*

I want free stuff

(Same username on eve as redit)
---
Said the guys in Stain as well but nothing stops StainGuy!
---
No sir, thanos you for remaining perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
I like you. You're funny
---
They will skip AT this year to focus more on the game.   
---
They will do a world tour instead of a fanfest.   
---
I wonder what results this gets us. I doubt there will be much, but let's see. 
---
unjerk here for a minute.
---
I think you're part of the problem Stainguy. I know you mean well, but you constantly post ideas and whip up people into a frenzy about something completely different 2 or 3 times a week. Every time people care less and CCP pay less attention because they can really only be working on 2 or 3 things at a time, and some of the ideas you post are months long projects.
---
Just need more focus. Pick a couple things that really matter and drill at those.
---
Wonder if it could be done if betting were allowed. Just allocate a portion of that money for the winners of the tournament, the rest goes to the winners of the bet, maybe some to the organizers (and space lawyers). Assuming it all isn’t immediately stolen of course.
---
You are wrong. I brought more players to eve then you seem to be aware of.
---
Bappi boi
---
In large part people aren't leaving tools off the battlefield to reduce tidi. The limiting factor is and has always been how many dudes you can bring. Tidi is not capping the people you cram into system
---
You'll be back. Everyone was outraged after CSM minutes a couple years ago leading to the infamous '250mil tick'. People spammed the sub calling for another jita protest and mass unsubbing, what did that achieve? A lot of memery, karna whoring and everyone came back 
---
One thing Eve is good for, is giving people data sets to play with, and hone skills. 
---
He only cut down the original monologue and added a line: 
---
&gt;In the documentary Dangerous Days: Making Blade Runner, Hauer, director Ridley Scott, and screenwriter David Peoples confirm that Hauer largely modified the "Tears in Rain" speech. In his autobiography, Hauer said he merely cut the original scripted speech by several lines, adding only, "All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain".
---

---
Never been one to join in the hate for CCP decisions, but this is the worst decision they've made in a while.  This tournament has brought me back and kept me interested in Eve and got me to come back to playing multiple times.
---
Anyway, just posting to express my disappointment.
---
we want to make sure we’re fully focused on improving quality of life in  New Eden, working on balance concerns that have been highlighted by the  community and delivering awesome new content for capsuleers across the  cluster to enjoy.
---
Translate:
---
Pearl Abyss says we should focus on PVE Content for casual players and soften the game further so that they don't quit because of being shot at.
---
Also we plan to deliver more pink and purple ship skins.
---
I wish people would actually boycott it. I hurts how bad this game has become. Unsub. 
---
But those pretend pixels yo gota keep mining while netflix is on.
---
I'll be right here playing Eve. One tournament does not a game make. 
---
Am whale to, am unsubbed too.
---
TLDR: Nerd biomassed last year but due to unprecedented amounts of autism stuck around and then thinks anyone gives a shit his entitled ass has to say. Literally who gives these plebs a fucking stage to speak from
---
It was removed because of its spamability. Anything in your cargo got transferred as well, including skill injectors (something not found on SiSi unless you use a skill extractor first).
---
honestly their quality of life release is great, and i assume the reason their holding back on telling us all that is to come is because EvEsterdam (and thus their keynote) is coming up soon. They want to have something to surprise us with.
---
I read - 10man alt corp
---
Ridley Scott has always attributed it entirely to Hauer. That's where I first heard the story. Here's one of him telling it. 
---
https://youtu.be/uPUIDHQv8rM
---
I know you likely heard it all before, but you were hugely appreciated by the tournament community, and I've never heard anyone say anything but praise when it came to what you did and said. 
---
When you were let go it was not only a huge blow to CCPs ability to do the tournament, but also a blow to the tournament community for who you were and your integrity. 
---
Thanks for everything you did.
---
Fuck you i wont do what you tell me.
---
Feb 2019, the first time the Eve is dying meme became true.
---
Almost. 
---
.
---
Like......
---
Something.......
---
Is wrong atm...
---
......
---
Sounds good, What will be the fit of your rattlesnake that tank 2,3k dps, it s a lot !!
---
)heh guys, eve is totally fine, right guys? guys?)[https://i.imgur.com/D5xRYuz.png]
---
Maybe you are right here.        
---
But over the years i asked mostly to adjust the ingame map just to reflect various mechanic changes.          
---
* range /mobility nerfs -&gt; many areas became much more desolate and not accessible             
---
* sov changes -&gt; goal was to give ability for smaller groups to get space ... good! but how those groups are to contest areas like period basis, paragon soul, omist ... or any similar places           
---
Some time ago i posted very simple solution :            
---
Each region have to connect to closest NPC space , and each NPC null to low space.            
---
This way all regions are accessible for various people and groups - but yeah i post way to much.          
---
Dud the last answer is 100% correct. 
---
The others dont matter once the final one is established.
---
fozziesov deffo helped kill interest in the game which led to these budget cuts that cut the AT
---
lots of bad changes contributed more though
---
Never cared much about the actual matches, but I always tuned in for the glorious shittalks in between. 
---
a ton of things, like combatting the farmer issue, and incentivizing actual pve that is interactable easily by pvpers, which in turn drives up its profitability 
---
who the no-name fuck are you?
---
TLDR: Virgin got laid, thinks hes cool
---
World of Warships, because that's basically how it felt in the first place anyway. 
---
Even during my 7 year break from Eve I tuned it online every year to watch the AT and see who won.
---
Let's check if this Garbage will stack with the old Garbage. If it doesn't, you can bet it's some kind of rare Jove Garbage that makes triple concentrate boosters that will get any capsuleer totally off their face.
---
You would need to get all the ships in there, it would get leaked and stuff and would be a logistical nightmare
---
I..i'm all alone. Well at least I still have my skill injectors..
---
You put your name on it, thats were the poo gets flung.
---
Oh well that puts an end to the same alliances cheating and fixing the outcome every year...yay win
---
Cya in a week
---
Even though my team got curb-stomped in ATXI it was an experience i'll never forget. Thanks for making it happen.  
---
A true patriot doesn't sit in his chair claiming that his country is the best.
---
A true patriot will criticise the people running it so that his country can be the best.
---
it's sad but i [predicted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ae9x49/old_chat_system_may_come_back/edreist/?context=0) it would happen when they posted that announcement that they have plans to restore it to its old version after monitoring it for a month...
---
If it is your time to leave then leave. You don't need to try and poison the community before you leave just because you feel your time is done.
---
I suspect people underestimate the effort which goes into actually running the AT. How many people it took.
---
Playing all the games i didnt play when eve was good and not a greedy shitty version of an EA clone.
---
perhaps the "future plans for AT" are just that "no AT. period."
---
Contests where chance plays no part, whether run in good or bad faith, are allowed under the current rules.
---
But funding a 13 figure prize pool isn't happening without AT ships. 
---
Well, time to hang up the hat and look back at a nice long history of excitement, long days and stress.
---
Thank you everyone who has ever been involved in the tournaments in any shape or form. o7
---
Having only made it as far as the B Team for practice (PL), even that was an absolutely insane time and skill investment.  It was always worth it though to cheer the boys along.
---
i want the community to not accept CCP's shit any more so CCP can actually fix the game
---
CCP is the one that poison's their community, by driving everyone but the fanboys away
---
im bitter
---
God damn opinions on forums so inconvenient.
---
EVE Online: Battle Royale 2020; Soon™
---
Probably.
---
Like nike, just do it
---
makes me wonder... what if zkill just ceased to exist in protest of the shit CCP is doing? would that help kill of the abomination that we know as EvE? 
---
Eve Vegas is around the same size as Fanfest (or a little larger.)
---
Iceland's good, but expensive. And tbh, I think some people needed a break from going every year. (You see some faces time and again.)
---
This year, I'm doing Toronto, and probably Vegas. Maybe London. (I'm in Scotland)
---
Pixels are not assets....
---
Fuck people are dumb. (Unless You rmt i guess go you)
---
while i suppose thats fair, why remove it entirely instead of fixing it (once per couple days), or just seeding mutaplasmids?
---
i just want to test dumb stuff without throwing isk away when i die
---
You seem pretty hot and bothered by mine.
---
Get fucked faggots https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98443830/
---
You already came to an unchangeable  conclusion before you posted on this reddit, you can feel how anyway you like but my opinion is not alone.. it’s great that more people will be able to see it but I’m a bit concerned if this is going to be like a con or if it’s actually going to have some soul to it and pub crawl and all the devs and all the people you would normally see will be there, I’m just not giving them high hopes atm
---
Get fucked https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98443830/
---
&gt; What you have remaining is a gaming industry that places profits over players. 
---
I don't think a company that is doing a world tour event has this mindset. 
---
Another thing to add, i think that a game that has many people who "won Eve" coming back over and over again is a good sign that Eve will be around for a while. 
---
Hey atleast those awesome devs that work on the AT project don't have to spent their precious free time anymore to work on something the players love -.-
---
Dont believe em. I been gone 3 months. Easy as shit if you remember good eve.
---
It's by far not the worst idea for a player event. But you could hardly compare to the AT.
---
Good Job countering his argument :)
---
Personally i think the windfalls are earned. It costs alot of money to participate in the AT. I hope the reason for cancelling  the AT is along the lines of reviewing Eve as an esports platform.
---
I do dislike the power of the AT ships over the years tho. Its not been as much of a problem since the recent ones were blackops/covert ops. But look at the effect of the Malice/Cambion/Etana on the AT. 
---
The teams that win it once, have a far greater change of winning again due to these ships. 
---
I'm going with a nearby managed apartment, rather than the hotel the event is in.
---
It's costing me about half what the hotel is.
---

CCP doesn't poison the community. They hurt it with changes that cause parts of it to die off. Poisoning it would be doing things that cause the community to die off without changes. IE encouraging lots of people to unsub for ideological reasons thinking you are making an impact but in reality CCP never cared what you had to say because you were unsubbed.
---
What we should be doing is beating the drums and the ground making a racket. We need to move mountains so that CCP notices what we are upset about. The only thing they will notice if you unsub is the loss of a sub and then double down on scrimping and penny pinching.
---
No but go ahead and just unsub and tell yourself that makes a difference. I know that making a racket so that we can be heard is hard work.
---
Also what a way to kick off a summit 
---
People are still logging in. People are still fighting. Not sure what your problem really is, but you should seriously seek professional help.
---
imo this might be worth it to put a final nail in the coffin of EvE, perhaps someone could pull it off.
---
1. Organize an AT-type event
---
2. Allow betting
---
3. Get banned for it and cancel the event, perhaps midway through the tournament
---
4. Post on r/EvE and create even more hate towards CCP
---
5. Finally kill off this monster we now know as EvE
---
Hopefully I’m hoping that I’m wrong and this will be a great change, maybe I’m just sour I got to miss the big ones in the past and lack a good reason to blow money to go to Iceland now lol 
---
Bo Hunt. GSF Diplomat, KF recruitment officer, and generally someone who is tired of you bunch of crybabies.
---
Who the no name fuck are you?
---
I hope to get into the community scene more in the coming years so I’m just sour I guess the one year I could afford it, maybe a break is healthy for the community, I’m prob gona go to Vegas 
---
Zoomed in max graphics 6 bil isk pve ships thats who.....as they brag to there friends tucked inside a super umbrella... look at the ships with the most skins....
---
You will work it out.
---
it is now a hot dog eating contest except with asteroids instead of hotdogs and bots instead of people
---
&gt;people who don't like eve are mentally ill
---
yikes
---
There's also a small chance that CCP is manipulating players with the news of them cancelling the AT. They might come out with a new announcement like "due to the massive outcry we decided to keep the AT this year" to literally silence all those rioting against CCP and magically divert attention from other problems the game is facing at the moment, please don't fall for that shit... they might be manipulating us...
---
Leaving this here to say "called it" in a few weeks/months when they announce they decided to bring back AT... 
---
Thank god you had some commentary. I was about to be seriously disappointed if it was just another cookie cutter video that was sped up and had random music thrown in! Good on you for adding text to give some context/communication! 
---
I've not actually seen as many Gilas as I thought I would. So far in the past week I've lost 2 Vedmaks (both times to a Vagabond), killed a Scythe Fleet Issue (with a Phantasm), killed an Orthrus (Vedmak), and had [one Gila exit the gate as I was attacking him.](https://clips.twitch.tv/CooperativeTalentedRavenFunRun)
---
tldr
---
Siege green offically the only koreans left i like.
---
you say ccp should fire 800 employees ?
---
How much
---
Thunderdome has been dead for some time now mate, along with the dream of easy to run tournaments.
---
As for the rest, you and everyone else saying "let's do it ourselves" doesn't have a fucking clue about all the work needed to run a 2v2 tourney, and the AT is far worst.
---
You would need a place isolated for the players that noone can influence, unbiased people runing it, trusty people to handle the rewards and we are not even getting close to being able to do it.
---
Just ask yourself: how would you control if everyone is playing by the rules without the appropiate tools? Even the ones currently in use need to be fine-tuned by someone to check this things.
---
It's not about having someone able to stream and comment (although that's another issue to tackle), it's about the amazing ammount of work going behind the scenes to make the AT matches actually happen.
---
Ask the EVE NT crew how it was for them to run 3 seasons of a 5v5 tournament, and how many simply burned out because of it.
---
&gt;Also we plan to deliver more pink and purple ship skins.
---
Greed is Bad! Greed is Bad! Greed is Bad! 
---
Give it to me and I'll return 20mil
---
uhm no... losing is the core of the game.... the most famous stories are always involved with somebody getting screwed over and losing a lot of items. You bounch back. I wouldn't be able to count how many times I lost something that at the time was insanly valuable for me but now looking back at it its peanuts. 
---
Its EVE :)
---
i want in as well!! i can't stand solo queueing...all these kiddies with open mic are reminding me of brace comms :'(
---
20 people that profit from quiet moon mining space ...     
---
There is also bunch "players" that constantly farm missions, 23/7 ... when local is clear.        
---
Sometimes those players for some reason have tendency to do strange stuff, like dropping and scooping a MTU on a same spot for like 3hours. 
---
Fuck that was long.....
---
And worth reading every line. Ty
---
Why did you quit?
---
You are a lucky man :D
---
In the 8 boxes i've opened this far, i dont think the combined stuff in there was worth 5 mill.
---
you know there was a time before zkill where every alliance had their own KB. of cause no ESI confirmation 
---
Confirmed, if PA were taking a direct influence there would be no need for an earnout clause, which is designed to keep existing company structures as intact as possible.
---
stuck with the mining/kill serpentis/angle ship task. rebooting not doing the trick for me and there so few angle ships in WH, i guess i am through with it this time
---
[https://imgur.com/a/RTs9gJG](https://imgur.com/a/RTs9gJG)
---
Thanks for the reply. That's pretty good reasoning against my idea and I appreciate that. I wasn't putting much thought into it anyway, just a passing idea.
---
I hope that Star Citizen may at some point be able to offer the thrill of spaceship pvp... but it will never involve the same amount of depth, risk and meaning as eve. 
---
Stuka not *quite* as easy as it looks huh. :)
---
Dunno where this "small gang meta has died" comes from. 90% of my gameplay is small gang fighting. 
---
Capital application, risk adverse game play, turtle sov, boring pve, watching the game turn into a mess of bad balance, and afk pvers.
---
Citadel spam. Broken game implementations  (chat as an example). Skill farm online.... skins as priority. Faction warfare, moon mining, lowsec death for years and years.
---
Titans online  ( i have alot of caps just so im not labeled a nano l33t) 
---
I could go on and on but it would be to long and depressing.
---
Again.... who?
---
How so?
---
Being in a corp that had a wardec on them where I endedup having to stay docked for a month is what pushed me away.
---
I'm back now, 3 years later almost. I'm happy with this change.
---
That sounds like the EVE equivalent of the melee battle after the jousting's finished. I endorse this produce and/or service (although as the pilot currently ranked 55,009th on Zkill I would obviously not be taking part).
---
I mean, I was going to say fair enough. And it's a decent enough billboard. But dude, you're an asshole.
---
eat-your-poopoo-and-like-it seems to be the perfect way to describe when someone is encouraging you to like something that *you know* is shit
---
Save it for buying skills, join horde or karmafleet. Get free ships. Learn to pvp, and ofc diffrent ways to make isk. Have a good time learning how massive this game is. Best of luck!
---
How would you fix it
---
sad when the normie fanboys want out as well
---
you forgot to mention those juicy SKINS in the NES store
---
Nah I'm one of the strange people who does one account. 
---
I was only hanging on to own that sweet looking angel titan.....
---
I was hoping it was going to have 4 rigs slots...all hyperspatials.
---
R.I.P my accounts
---
[removed]
---
These are so awesome i love the NER team
---
Wait till eve becomes a shitty clone of bdo. You'll remember thr times when eve was a shitty ea clone with fondness
---
Try them all. Training into T1 ships takes hours, not weeks so it’s a low risk thing and you’ll eventually do it if you play long enough. 
---
That was deep
---
it still exists but one of the reasons i stopped playing was that you had to spent hours to get a couple minutes of reasonable fighting in 00. the time vs. reward ratio is just no longer worth it as everyone drops caps with hictors at gates or hardcounters your ship. 
---
Well there is still hope ... they said "next year" ... i know alot of people here considered it completely done, but CCP is still a company that knows that taking AT as a whole away is a huge impact, that might be something like "we take nullsec away".
---
So CCP taking it away this year with "we have alot of stuff to do, but next year it will def be back" is probably on the edge, but people might accept at (i mean what chance do we have anyway). But if it won't come back next year ... the i could imagine that alot will stop playing, as AT was basically what they did, training several months for it, prepping and such.
---
Hillarious.. 
---
Elite Dangerous kinda gets close, but isn't as robust lorewise (or really gameplay wise) as EVE.
---
Perhaps we're looking at this even from a wrong perspective? It's an event made for bots to grind boring time consuming bosses and mine ore, like a boot camp for bot AI testing or some shit...
---
Is no one else worried about that massive hurricane that is about to completely wreck that temperate planet and all of the PI colonies that inhabit it!?!
---
:insert blind fan boy reply about how ccp care as i shove my money in ccps wallet:
---
Fuck u ccp. Shame on you. 
---
He reps 100hp/sec. Its a dps check so adjust your fit. Literally 102 dps will kill him just takes time. 
---
That was an amazing post, I legit laughed.
---
Let’s collectively kill ourselves over CCP canceling the AT once, while we’re at it
---
welp
---
Thx bruh
---
That’s a little selfish, how about us that actually enjoy the game regardless?
---
you expect a game that entirely DEVELOPS on the shipskinconcept that destroyed eve to ever give you something meaningful? i found the SC community to be the most zealous i have ever encountered. So far the game is a financial grave version of DCS and i don't see it ever becoming more let alone ever coming close to what eve used to be.
---
MVP Comment.
---
It was a source of engagement and a conflict driver in a game that is currently seriously lacking in them.
---
Calm down, miner. You really should get a permit, even if you made the red pen list and now have to pay treble. 
---
to be honest I never watched AT or had any desire to be in it.. but even I understand how dumb it would be to take AT away. just take this poor dog out back and shoot it, things are just going to get so miserable if they keep going down this road.. 
---
It would be impossible to build, even on Sisi we'd get tryhards ruining it. And it wouldn't matter - someone would claim bias/favoritism on the organisers and it would be an 'illegitimate' event.
---
And I owe a lot to a whole bunch of people for their help in making it happen.
---
CCP Fozzie tirelessly took the time to sit down with me to look at the rules and try to come up with something challenging every year.
---
CCP Masterplan, CCP karkur and CCP Bartender answered my endless stream of inane technical questions as I chopped and changed the tournament tools (and reviewed my code to make sure I didn't break anything). I'm still a little surprised I managed to commit as much code as I did, it's not everywhere that you'll find a community developer actually developing the game itself! And for the tools themselves, I was building on the shoulders of the giant CCP Veritas who originally wrote them. I would never have been able to do what he did.
---
All the Ops guys who helped me get Thunderdome up and running. This was a big deal for me, as I believe it massively improve the competitiveness of the tournament as everyone could now easily practice as much as they needed. Thunderdome had other implications beyond just the Alliance Tournament for the community, and I was delighted to have been able to help facilitate a bunch of other community events.
---
A whole battalion of GMs who showed up on the weekends to run the matches over the years, alongside a dedicated group of developers who came in to help run the live broadcast. CCP ArnarV especially needs credit for making the broadcast actually happen as the director and all around camera master. Live broadcasts are no easy thing, and while we weren't perfect we certainly tried to make it the best we could.
---
EVE NT for their own work broadcasting the tournament when we weren't. I can't fully express the amount of love, gratitude, and respect I have for these guys.
---
There's a whole lot of people I haven't mentioned that helped out over the years, but they were just as instrumental as everyone else in making this thing happen. You know who you are, and you have my unending gratitude.
---
And don't forget yourselves. We made this for you guys to watch and enjoy and reminisce and cry and cheer along with everyone else. Your passion for the tournament made it all worth it in the end more than any other metric.
---
“It’s pretty easy to fly to Stain, you just gotta go through either the incredibly camped catch pipe, through delve and period basis or through the catch pipe, impass, feyth and esoteria”
---
sorry it sounds like you might know how to write code that produces a correct result from basic arithmetic operations if there's any chance of that CCP probably won't let you help
---
venal is out of the question
---
No, you need to seek help because you have a hateboner for a game that you claim to not even play.
---
Lol...
---
I'm surprised they never realized that.
---
Those skins are pretty BUT YOU NEVER SEE THEM.
---
When you explode someone, the last thing you have on your mind is what skin he is sporting. When it's your skin, unless you are at Battlecruiser level, you barely notice it considering how small your ship is.
---
If there was a way to make the ships and skins more visible then it could justify all the focus they put on those skins.
---
Your going to give a fucking shit company money like Ati-blizard? I would rather piss teh money up against the wall of a police station when 2 officers are watching than give then a cent after the shit they just pulled making record earnings, rehiring an old CFO (or whatecr position he is) with teh 15 million handshake (3 mill now and the rest tied to performance)....then fire 770 employees (granted with severance etc).
---
It's not a company I'm willing to give any more money to. CCP whilst they may be fucking up the game, they are not being as callous or heartless by firing about 8% of their staff after making record earnings. I'm willing to give them another 6 months before I fuck off too. They need to get their shit together and make the game interesting as the current state of null, as it stands, is solely on CCP's shoulders due to the retardation of Rorquals and many other changes like Sov, Moons and any other real conflict instigation. We literally have none anymore. No-one wants more territory, moons are not worth fighting over at an alliance level as they are now line member income sources, not alliance level (due to how mining went from AFK to active). Sov you have to sov wand and that's it, people fucking hate it and it's boring as fuck sitting on a blops or titan or 4 hours whilst your buddies (who are equally bored stupid) sov wand nodes that pop up. The fleets never get dropped on eachother and there is hardly ever any reason to engage and cutting off your opponents industrial backbone of any of the big groups is almost impossible now aside from a little low hanging fruit picking due to the almost 2 years or whatever of retarded mining output being pumped intot he only logical thing around that consumes teh insane quantities of ore mined: titans and supers with supporting fax swarms.
---
I may be a Goon but fuck me this whole current meta of the game is so fucking boring and shit thatI feel CCP deserves EVERYTHING we give them when it comes to their fuck ups because, to be honest, I can't remember ANYTHING they have done in the past 18 months thats actually been in the best interests of the game, created conflict or not been a total fucking mess on launch. I used to love CCP but now a days they are becoming a shining example of how to turn the golden goose into offal, only because you wanted to feathers for a pillow. It's beyond stupid and it's very dissapointing  
---
OP, at this point, just shut down your computer and go.
---
I never participated in AT...but I definitely enjoyed watching is (minus the horrid hosting).
---
CCP might feel they have our concerns at heart. However, Falcon's statement seems more to me that its geared towards placating the Eve community rather than just outright saying "Hey, we have some issues currently. They need to be addressed and a 2019 AT drive is just something that will bog us down."
---
We get it. A 64 bit client will be a great thing. Fixing the shit chat is equally important. Just dont sit there and write some smug statement trying to dumb the playerbase down cause you dont want to say that you dont care about our feeling in regards to the AT.
---
So many great developers seem to be doing everything they can to destroy thier best IPs lately. There is anti-community decisions being made across the board. Maybe I'm just watching too much Jim Stirling, but starting to get worried. 
---
&gt; People have described this as a stress test being developed by you guys to see how little you can give out while seeing how many people will still participate. 
---
How sweet.
---
You do realize that many of the games out right now see their players more as trends to be analyzed than actual players.
---
You are a metric for many of those game; I blame World of Warcraft for that. I bet they are indeed using the event to collect some kind of useless metric when the one they should care about is how many find their game **meaningful**.
---
What will this AT have?
---
Cheating? You bet 
---
Match fixing? Definitely 
---
Collusion? Highly likely
---
Huge Gangs crashing the party? Hell yeah! 
---
So what can a non-dev do to stop any of this? Praying to Bob might work. In reality; sweet fuck all. 
---
*laughs in trillionare*
---
Again.
---
You would reverse my comments above as a decent start... this is a sandbox, but its catering for dumbed down play styles. Join or die. I choose death.
---
But i know that its done now... eve is just a cash cow. So i voted with my accounts. 6 or so aint many, but its all i can do. It makes no difference i know this,
---
But after 15 years they have stopped deserving my support.
---
What argument? The one in which he says that because some guys cheated once they should stop the tournament? It's like saying that because some goons botters were teleported to hoghsec we should remove nullsec. 
---
You guys have jobs, right?
---
Oh...shit
---
You should have been here a few years ago.
---
Those events were fantastic, great source of content and good reason to sub.
---
Those new events you are seeing a properly horrific, so with that perspective is even more of a trainwreck.
---
If he’s smart, he’ll use a passive targetter and I don’t think you have any definite way of knowing. Just assuming any heron or similar sitting on gates in high sec pipes are scanning you. 
---
1. Corp assets follow the same asset safety rules as personal assets.
---
2. Note that one can trigger asset safety manually to get items out of a structure for which you've been locked out. It's not a great solution though.
---
watch for batting of the eyelashes fidgeting shifting of posture drooling panting and dry humping
---
&gt;talk to a therapist because you do not like something i like
---
classic 
---
Amen lol
---
if they have a hat and sunglasses on, they're definitely shady
---
so literally mid tier bureaucrat in org dedicated to krabbing. Wear the badge with pride my friend
---
Dude, we are collectively pissed with CCP right now... Chill down a notch and give the guys some time to work on the issues! :(
---
You can usually see it by the animation, unless your graphics are in potato-mode. Passive Targeting modules won't give the 'locked' symbol to targeted ships, so dont go by that symbol alone
---
You guys sure make it look like it haha 
---
I do too, I also remember the ratio being 30 times insta blapped for every 1 time you got a semi not shit fight.
---
NS gatecamps were not content creators, they were the same retarded htfu that wardecs were to small highsec corps.
---
Man's trying to save the game and you come with baseless garbage like that? Back the shit you say bud, least take two seconds to do some research
---
Ha.....hahah.
---
&gt; have fun in the game
---
Well theres your issue
---
Yes the quality of life release is good, however it is no substitute for content. Fixing QoL is something that is EXPECTED by customers of a product that is in need of fixing or streamlining. It does not substitute for engaging content. It's there to be appreciated in the background of the releases, not be the focus. If it is the focus, there has to be the reason behind it as to why there isn't anything more substantial to be consumed on the normal content rotation...and boy are we LONG LONG overdue for engaging content. Honestly I can't remember the last good content release aside from the first citadel patch in the past few years, and even then it's not that great due to the insane proliferation and the fucked up timers etc
---
the CCPlease initiative could've been such a good tool for community-developer communication, but it's just another PR stunt made to look like they're actually allocating the 40 million they make a year to eve online 
---
Genuine question, why would a ship be in a container?
---
wait didn't they say if would not effect anything when the fired the community team.....
---
CCP dirty freaking liars
---
But then again, why are we surprised???!!!

The drifters killed the "empress" and The Other took over... how not to say the others are not taking those clones and escaping the construct now with Amarrs help.  Amarr\\Drifters vs Minmatar\\Jove

Eve online EPIC BATTLENITE FORT ROYALE
---
The ultimate fix to this problem is to *remove asset safety from nullsec*
---
People don’t care about blowing up citadels when there’s no reward, which is why you see so many low power citadels in nullsec. Have them drop loot and you will give nullsec an extra layer of content.
---
Cargo and ship scanners have a unique "tooroop" (in lack of a better explanation) sound. Try it on someone so you can remember and recognize it.
---
Amazing story! For me who haven't been in AT since around AT VI or similar, makes me want to try introducing it to my family who always viewed Eve as a nerdy &amp; arcane hobby of mine
---
Alliance Tournament - last high-end content in game, after injectors came, which you cannot complete in 1-2 months after joining game. Titans/supers/rorquals are not, can ask any pilot from delve.
---
I don't think that CCP are idiotic, but I think that news is bad indicator of full "EVE Online status  and CCP business". And it was started from EVE\_NT and goons tournament closing in 2017. atm I see major contradiction in next facts: CCP 2nd year still closing arena tournaments, but starting new **arena-based** pve/pvp content on tranq(wut? seriously?). 
---
There are some obvious points, if you want to see  high level competitions and interest from community side to tournament activity:
---
1. keep participant's basic motivation - good prizes, good broadcasts,  timely announcements(!) and ect.
---
2. keep ease of participation - people need to know that everyone can try tournament if he want(maybe not main tournament, but additional like was EVE\_NT)
---
3. need organize or support so much additional competitions as you can (lets see on dota2 starladder) and every time try to add new any next year/season.
---
4. need simplify rules so close as possible to tranq eve, it will help viewers dont close stream. AT16 rule about 1 ship per setup was absolutely shit for viewers( who are we kidding, it was absolutely shit for most at16-participants)
---
5. try to keep progress improvements in theorycrafting and piloting - publish stats, reports, support offline tounament-match viewer and ect.
---
6. protect participants from routine of practices - thunderdome, tournament tools and ect.
---
Work on this clauses have accumulative effect - if you doing all fine, there are no guarantees that you will see result "on next day", but every time when you skip any of this points, every time when you drop tournament, you will do huge step back in reached progress and competitions level in your game, and next *n* tournaments you will come back to previous level.
---
year after year CCP dissipated people who work on tournaments(Veritas, Logibro),  reduced community's  expectations from tournaments, droped tournament tools.  I don't want to blame specific people, who spent spare time for my end-game content: Logibro, Fozzie, I believe, they did all right in their competence and power. Great thanks, Fozzie and Logibro! As I think last 3 years, it is CCP's leadership mistake don't support  their employees in tournaments organization.
---
P.S. Logibro, we fucked up. ("The day it all went fucking away", idk,  translation difficulties wanna say in russian "Logibro, мы всё проебали")
---
P.P.S. It's only my opinion, I can look as home-expert, I don't care :) 
---
I'm sorry for hard text-wall %(
---
ok 👍 
---
Maybe i did a poor job of explaining this, what i meant was the ability to apply fitting to the ship with modules for it in a container
---
Is there some kind of LFG for fleet if I want to group up to do security missions, exploration, etc?  
---
Not really too interested in joining a corp at the moment as I have really limited playing time, but will still like to group up for some pve action.
---
So first off: do whatever you want to do or sounds interesting to you. It doesnt matter what it is. Dont go explore or mine just because someone tells you. You try things out and you do what YOU want to do. That is the most important rule you should make yourself. 
---
3 main pieces of advice for Eve: 
---
- try stuff out. Even if it means losing your ship. Learning things the hard way is, in my opinion, the best way to learn Eve. Ships are so dirtcheap nowadays, and thus so easily replaceble. Think of ships as Ammo. 
---
- I would advise to do the Career Agent missions. Theyre basically an extended Tutorial towards the different paths/careers for you to persue in Eve. You will get some ships or skillbooks or modules for free. All this to get a general grasp to find out what you find most fun. 
---
- dont fly what you cant afford. Meaning; dont fly a 500mil ship if thats all you have. Make sure you get some extra ISK that you can still do something in the game to make money and mainly have fun. To add on that: even if you have the money to buy mutiple such ships/fits then, then make sure you have decent skills. 
---
Skills matter alot in Eve. The only bad way to play Eve is if you dont have fun. 
---
The only thing they'll be working on, is micro transactions and loot boxes, paid for with the micro plex so thoughtfully created for this purpose.
---
I think he means fitting a hull would search for the necessary mods from containers in your station hangars. I have my hangar set up with several large containers for; loot, ammo, mods, drugs and fuel, drones, etc. It would be handy to click a fitting and it searched and dragged all the bits out of those hangars instead of me having to manually dig through each hangar.
---
Im taking everything to the grave.
---
Some rorqual miner would end up with cool shit
---
..not happening.
---
If they use this passive target module, I still have a short visual Clue them?
---
Inspired 
---
You wanna tell me that ccplease is a failure after few days of its existence? 
---
You felt strongly enough to comment on it.
---
Mans trying to save the game LOLLLLLLLL 
---
There’s a few issues that people aren’t happy about, this is a pretty healthy way for them to express themselves imo. Don’t worry though, the game still kicks ass and there’s so much fun / content to be had. 
---
or sit with any industrial on jita undock :p
---
I see... Do you know if they make the same sound? Or if they have a small variation?
---
The context of it was lost on you i guess.
---
vOv
---
no u 
---
o7 logibro. Wish you were still here. Sad days, but I’m happy to have once more the occasion to say thank you for all you have done for the AT.
---
If there was a joke i definitely missed it yes. Apologies.
---
YEAH THEY HAVE A LOT OF COOL STUFF ON THE WAY THAT THEY CAN'T TELL US ABOUT JUST WAIT
---
No us
---
No need &lt;3
---
So blow them up and then report them as bots
---
While not directly killing it CCP has decided to focus on "rebalancing" this year. They said it will be back next year but we'll have to see about that.
---
Ok, let's not go that far!  &gt;.&gt;
---
this \^, even simple ability to select which container to search for mods would be nice
---
the eve_nt crew have a few dudes who are plenty knowledgeable with the tournament tool, they'd really just need one ccp dude to turn the server on and hang out to make sure nothing burns down
---
this is eve online and all of that sounds dope
---
No fanfest!? Is that true? Why!?
---
&gt; The south had no strategic objective other than have fun.
---
it was a horde structure you dork
---
Going to go on a limb and assume we mean Pearl Abyss here.
---
As a long time player of Black Desert, I can confirm that the NA Calpheon protests, the largest in years, did absolute jack in the face of PA.  I honestly doubt they even found out about it.
---
Things only changed when the KR community took up our mantle aka when player sentiment was at PA’s doorstep.
---
It may have worked before, but I fear things may have changed.
---
Well it was great at its height, when money was spent on it. 
---
Yikes.
---
It’s to late for that anyway now that we have enjoyed the taste of freedom. Also balance changes last a few months at best of casual curiosity about the new mechanics AT is half a year job and a real goal. 
---
Please add Alliance bookmarks and Alliance hangar 
---
As a GM once told me when I asked a dinar question: 
---
"...that's not what SISI is for. It's for play testing upcoming game features, not for seeing what the best fit is for ratting, pvp or abyssals."
---
*game
---
Ah, yes, truly -- players are responsible for maintaining the health of the game. I am remiss in my responsibilities for keeping the game alive! How neglectful! How shameful! What will we do now?????
---
I had one where the abyssal nasty mean ship was half in and half out of the abyssal safe area(fuck knows what it's called) and it was just hung there and wouldn't take damage. So I died. When I tried to get a replacement they told me it was a client side problem and not their fault.
---
why in a safe system ? give the alliances also the possibility to kill the other miners 
---
I do so love these positions of abject submission. So much so that I'll accept them even when we've done nothing to actually procure them.
---
Even during my various EVE hiatus' (hiatii?) I always watched the AT and I always bet big boy isk on based on various teams or players I liked. Killing the AT is the final nail in the coffin. Any dumbass that was still insisting that EVE is doing fine just got a kick in the ass and a limp handshake.
---
John Smedley already holds the rights to that story.
---
What? It's not a jab at anyone. Wormholes aren't hard. Even if they are, you literally need 2 people who know what they're doing, and everyone else has the amazing ability of taking warps and jumping wormholes. 
---
A lot of people know enough wh mechanics regardless. They don't need to know the mass of a z142 or c140 or the difference between h900 and h296s when rolling with subs, basic wh knowledge is plenty.
---
As for knowing the issue exists, a few fcs knowing drifter wh's are broken, a few scanners, boom you have your super highway again. 
---
How do I calculate what the chances are for a turret and missile to hit me if I'm using an AB fit frig with tech 2 bonuses to signature reduction? 
---
People generally PvE on their own as grouping up doesn't afford you a lot of benefits. There are public PvP fleets though. 
---
well someone should let goons know 
---
What you just described is what happens when someone scans you. You get a brief "remote shield booster effect" and a rather quiet crackle sound. It's almost like someone pressed and instantly released the tangent on a walkie talkie.
---
No thanks, I'm not going to pay your excuse to gank people in highsec when I can already mine since code is evidently bad about policing it. Thanks for your concern though.
---
Anger ...... it makes you powerful....come to the drake side.
---
That’s really a dumb argument though. I don’t think that anyone has any doubt that the subscriptions cancelled last night represent way more money than it would cost to organise the event even on non volunteer basis. 
---
thanks Brisc now we cant have an AT because "ger gons"
---
Im sad stop making me laugh
---
I wish the log system could show it... I keep it opened all the time, and I was quite surprised to see it did not show any event :(
---
CCPlease is icing on the cake but without the cake.
---
'finding a game meaningful'. love it
---
Best thread 2019.
---
and this post is supposed to be ingredients for this cake
---
ccp has been doing this bait and switch for a long time, now they're moving onto popular ships so ppl started to realize
---
I did it mom!
---
\+1
---
Your reply to me indictates that you understand at least a part of his argument.
---
Well, he listed his reasons why he didn't like the AT (Windfalls for a small number of players, over strict rules, match fixing etc). You didn't bother trying to address his points, you just suggested that the csm's primary function is "White Knighting" CCP. 
---
ECM frigs ab'ing at 60+km while a double web pure DPS hekate holds you down.
---
the next important event is in march, you might see new then, they won't release epic news in the middle of nowhere "hey guys look we are going to that" in evepulse, chill, wait  and hide your pitchfork 
---
try jumping to a clone somwere else and you should get a popup warning that it will destroy the current clone if it does.
---
We could call it "tfn"
---
The final nail.
---
\&gt;Title says "large sum of ISK"
---
\&gt;click
---
\&gt;10 million ISK
---
Lol clickbait at its finest.
---
see my edit.
---
Like with any controversial decision only the csm that agree with it speak up. Even if the rest of the csm disagree with it they keep it for themselfs mainly. That's where the white knighting part comes from. His was the first csm member post that i saw so that's why i said it here. 
---
I support this idea, it’s EVE. You don’t wait for it to happen, you *make* it happen.
---
- expect to be ganked. That expectation should be taken into account as a factor of prizes allotted.
---
- broadcast it to the wider community, ask for a gentleman’s agreement to make this event off-limits to 'extracurricular activity’ [I’ve been there for a while, I know what I’m asking is akin to herding cats that are tripping balls on catnip, we should at least try]
---
- make extremely good and bluntly fair agreements on what is and is not tolerable, failure to comply will be a default loss
---
- this will be understood to be a player event, we can’t count on CCP [you’re really breaking my heart here, guys. 11 years in this mad house we can’t have an alliance tournament? This is a fucking tradition, come on!]
---
- a trusted [Ha!] entity will hold the prizes
---
/I’m ready now to give all the winners a Rifter [for starters, you have to start somewhere]
---
We have done things that were WAY beyond merely organising a player event. We -can- do this.
---
Let’s flap the wings of the butterfly ourselves, sweethearts!
---
Nice.
---
Nah, thank you.
---
I was the NC. AT captain for the years you ran the  AT, I still think Thunderdome was better than we deserved, and your commitment to run the tournament well really showed, and the following lack of support for the AT in the following years was an incredible drop from that standard, even though I'm sure the devs that were still involved in the project were all doing their very best with the limited resources they had available.
---
You're still probably the most loved dev in CCP's history by a mile for a decent bunch of the high-end AT team members and captains who played at the time, for good reason too.  
---
Hahah.. more entertaining than I expected 
---
"CCP knows what it is doing"
---
:bigthink:

---
Yup, the AT was pretty much the last thing worth staying subbed over to keep training skills and occasionally log onto to TQ once every couple months to do stuff with friends made over the years. Now I can just let the sub lapse and play other games with the same people.
---
I do not know all the ins and outs of this event but from what I do know (and what I learned this morning) the event is quite the let down.  :/
---
eve it's not pvp game anymore, lets call it PVR (player vs. rock) which suits current state way better.
---
I mean I'm cool with whatever just trying to enjoy it while I still can but - what you said, other people have been saying the same thing since as far I can remember. It's like a generic statement at this point.
---
you know what? im fine with that answer. i guess i just figured that since it was there before, it didnt mean it couldnt/shouldnt come back
---
Why don't we just do our own tournament on tq... fuck ccp. Will it be perfect... no. Is it still fun? Yes
---
All it costs is an AT
---
I just came back after like a tiny afk of 4 months, and I am already compelled to leave again, lmao, great job CCP.
---
CEASE AND DESIST!
---
I haven't noticed a difference.
---
what is it even supposed to do?
---
I support this idea. I hosted two of these events. One sisi. One tq. Both were a lot of fun. Let me know. Will it be some dope ass prize one of a kind ship prize... no. Fun still is very easily had. 
---
/s is your friend
---
I'm happy you are trying to get ideas and help CCP help us. Good on ya buddy. Keep on truckin'.
---
I however, got no ideas for any QOL updates besides uh... actually I got nothing.
---
Yeah, I'm afraid your right. 
---
Imo the AT adopted to many rules over the years, and btw Elise, your wrong, I remember the first few ATs, except for the first one,  and I enjoyed them due to the simplicity of the rules.
---
I can just imagine how fun the first few tourneys would have been with today's tools.
---
No losers bracket or anything,  just a straight run for the title
---
Blame Fozzie lol that always works.
---
o7 Buddy, we should play some more overwatch or something again one of these weekends
---
Awww man really? o7 to all the AT crew of the past.
---
How much TiDi was there?
---
zkill guide to 'doing nothing but pretending we are' please
---
And you are literally a nobody.  I wear my badge, you wear yours :D
---
give them community feedback on what QOL improvments would community like to see ;)
---
Just look at what they listed, three things already completed and one with an indeterminate date.
---
Take your break, like everybody else does.
---
We’ll be here [well, we should be] when you come back :-)
---
where can one do that?
---
Sure it sounds cool, but the whole point of the AT was that it was seperate from the rest of the game. 
---
its just their newest version of the "road map" they use to release.
---
ah, so a reintroduction of a thing they used to have when the game was better!
---
This post is fucking great ngl.
---
/sigh.  You obviously don't get it.  But hey, way to twist my words in a vain attempt to make yourself feel better.  Classical move of the mentally unstable.  It has nothing to do with you not liking something I like.  You claim not to play, but somehow try to act as if you are relevant.  You are not.  You never were, and you never will be.  For the record, I am also not relevant, never was, never will be.
---
Tru dat.
---
i think you're just projecting
---
remember to b4r if you need it
---
Who would you trust to administer it?
---
What if they also want your Fedo and all your Exotic Dancers and your collection of corpses?!
---
pretty much.
---
You **NEVER EVER** give anyone in EVE money to do what you want to.
---
It hung around 25-40% the entire time.
---
as in real life, ingame you will find dickheads and nice people as well, you just have to make your game to suits you. Not everyone is complaining, not everyone is a dick and not everyone you can trust.
---
good luck
---
Don't give the ideas like that you maniac
---
Not quiet...
---
EVE is dead
---
What would be a reason for you?
---
I have no stuff. 
---
I think it would be a really slow week here in this sub 
---
For every one of us that doesnt splurge on plex there are 2 more that will just make up for the rest of us. Nothing will change until they lose nearly 80-90% of their cashflow.
---
If its not good now, why dont you just move on?
---
Your work was a massive boon towards making the AT as exciting as it has been. Much love for that!
---
Do all the career agents, then do the SOE epic arc (google it). 
---
Either me getting some benefit from it, and/or it being a requirement for something else.
---
As it stands I can pretty much ignore PvP and nothing really changes.
---
You can always give it a try regardless. Alpha accounts are free to play, so you have nothing to really lose.
---
The majority of us playing just want to play and have fun. The vocal minority is what you are seeing.
---
"White knighting" is like "an argument from authority" is unconditional agreement with an authority and using that authority as the reason.
---
An example would be "CCP have been making games for longer than you've been playing them, they know what's best for us".
---
His argument, while unpopular, is a valid opinion. He shouldn't be restricted from posting his opinion just because he's a CSM member. Personally I think his opinion is a bit of a spit in the face of all the hardworking CCP staff that helped run the AT's over the years. So i'm a little surprised he posted it... but he does have the right to do so :)
---
Every change in the UI was a big step backwards!
---
The Agency is a big pile of shit - not offering half the functionality of what was.
---
CCP killed everything that was ok, replacing it with the work of retards.
---
Yep my last accounts will not renew subscription.
---
Any good massive multiplayer spaceship games around - only releaesed ones \*gg\* please
---
What about PVS? Player versus Spod?
---
Nothing of the value was lost
---
What would be the point of doing it then? I'm in my 10th day of playing and I'm still not understanding all the things you can do, I'm still looking out for people to play with as atm I always played alone, even if I'm in signal cartel now.
---
This Google sheet aims to let new players know and have an idea of the things they can do and the average time they will spend on doing something. To be a vet and jerk off on it is just stupid as it will be useless for everyone. My Reddit profile also tells a lot about it as just some days ago I started to follow/comment and share stuff on this thread, despite being a Reddit user since 2016
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
they can have everything but my corpse collection. I need them for ...science
---
So BL, NC etc weren't there for content either? Your daily peddling is funny to sit back and watch
---
AT is shit, and allways the same folk there, with a baiier to compete at dozens of AT ships.
---
Also the  viewership has fallen year after year since ATX.
---
Better to use the dev time for the game then wwaste it on the abortion that AT has become.
---
So many developers do this, instead of sticking with what works they have to make some personal project or some spinoff bullshit.
---
If someone doesn't know who SU is, who control about a quarter of the Galaxy, then they probably have been huffing spod for far too long.
---
you should like go out outside and get ur dick sucked or somethin
---
Because you can't neglect the Ochre.
---
I get the anger over the whole AT thing, but let's be real, no one is *actually* quitting over it.
---
Fuck, and I jumped ship to here from wow, what, will I have to make my own fucking game to stop it getting screwed over by greedy CEO's!?!
---
It's a bunch of recent issues @ ccp
---
is there anything they handled properly over the last two years?
---
Because 'Ochre first'... You know that c'mon. Dont make me phone Code
---
Ah thank you, yes this pleases the OCD tidy freak in me.  My mid slot station container will thank you 
---
Thank you 
---
Possibly, some prospects look grim.
---
Although You can give it a shot since it's free &amp; You might even find a fun niche.
---
To be fair, the most vocal ones you're hearing from also tend to be the angry ones. I'm personally having a lot of fun in the game, but that may just be me. IMO the game is definitely worth checking out.
---
(✿◠‿◠) Friendly reminder that tomorrow is Friendship Friday. (◕‿◕✿)
---
The day StainGuy gives up his gate is the day pigs can fly.
---
I think last time I saw this type of response is when they nerfd rorqs and supers.  Guess what, CCP was right. 
---
Honestly, if you haven't even given the game a try yourself and are quitting before you've even started, you wouldn't have lasted long anyway.
---
Eve is what you make of it, there are plenty of people sour over the AT, and rightly so, it is a massive part of Eve. CCP have slowly been getting rid of their no pretty much none existent community support team. If you find your niche and find people that still enjoy the game for the game and not for what CCP do in terms of content (seriously make your own) you may find you enjoy it.
---
Basing your thoughts of a place where many come to vent is not a good idea...
---
CCP has always been flawed. Yes, they can majorly fuck things up, but they've also done good, which tends to be overlooked. 
---
At the end of the day it's all about whether or not you enjoy the game. If the answer to this is no, then people are free to quit the game. The AT has always been a big part of EVE, no doubt about that, but it's being made to sound like that's all EVE has to offer anymore.
---
&gt;but it's being made to sound like that's all EVE has to offer anymore.
---
LOL i wonder why
---
 RemindMe! One Year
---
Has that ever stopped?
---
I have literally no words.
---
This year (or next soon tm) was going to be my first AT. I have it at the top of my things to do list within Eve.
---
'Good' PvP is becoming harder to find and I saw the AT as the principle of good PvP.. I doubt there are many players that don't take note of the alliance. Paper on not... I stop what I'm doing and watch every game. I am sure the 5-20 multi boxing to equal pilot does the same (though he doesn't have to stop what he's doing).
---
... I pray somebody or some group can take over the reigns and generate something that would resemble the tournament. 
---
Seeing these posts I wish CCP would announce AT for 2019, then the next day call it off again.
---
It's already free on private servers, probably closer to vanilla than classic will be.
---
At Fanfest last year Fozzie floated the idea of removing ships from the prize pool.  People went fucking BALLISTIC. This is where the whole "in it for the prizes" idea comes from.  If people didn't care about the prizes it shouldn't matter if the prize pool is lowered.
---

---
I stopped feeling things when they stripped the comet. 
---
"Oh we have both kinds of content. Mining AND ratting."
---
That's the only thing I'll give ccp credit for, as they could have very easily dragged it out to retain tournament-oriented players for longer. 
---
Imagine begging people for a made up currency in a video game.
---
Go play star citizen..... in 10 years :)
---
Yeah I for one am super impressed with improvents to "the game" - boat loads of ships skins, fat-fingered PVE content, and PLEX sale after PLEX sale.
---
A++++++
---
Maybe because it's something fun to do? Why does ccp have to spoon feed you with a reward to do this? 
---
This is a sandbox game where you have to make your own content and seek it out, and it always has been?
---
I'm all for these fuck ccp posts but I don't understand why there can't just be one fuck CCP post rather than the hundreds that have cropped up in the last 24 hours. Go karma whore and downvote brigade on /r/gaming instead if you're that desperate.
---
The last AT was pretty much player run already. The production and streaming was done by player volunteers but ccp volunteers and gms were referrees. Ccp paid for the studio (which could be crowdfunded easily imo). Several problems though: the tournament is run on a special toolbox that ccp probably doesn’t want to hand out to players. If it was run on a test server it would ruin the real loss part of it (including flag and at ships). If it’s run on sisi you have issues with checking rule compliance (could be sorted if you could enlarge the scope of esi on sisi and buff the update frequency). The tournament practice server has been on life support since last year and probably one of the reasons that led ccp to abandon it so anything relying on that isn’t realistic. 
---
Eve-nt guys would be trusted by the community and ccp but even low bar tournament on sisi would need some kind of interaction with ccp to provide minimal checking tools and time has proven that ccp is not able to provide it since logibro was fired.
---
  Miner, you definatly should pay your permits.
---
  Now that you are on the red pen list, I can fix this for you, for 70 millions isk.
---
  Else my brothers and sisters shall hunt you until you leave our Lord and Savior territory.   
---
  Praise James315!
---
Some people went "ballistic", most did not. Keep in mind, this was the first AT that eve-bet and any sort of betting was banned, lowering viewership...but the AT still happened, we had some great matches with some good upsets (Seriously who coulda seen TRI go as far as they did!?), and even had some newer players enter the tourney although overall attendance was lower than the prior year (Which can be attributed to a number of things).
---
Like I said, those that play in it play for the competition, not just the prizes. The prizes are an added bonus.
---
Well, that could be any one of them....
---
I'll sure miss it.
---
Always was looking forward to watch the livestreams.
---
Hope it will just skip this year and be back next year.
---
None of us is as dumb as all of us. 
---
Yeah or use wormholes to get a footing and go from there. I flew there from my old highsec home just the other day, only 1 low effort gate camp on the way and I got through that.

I've been keeping an eye on the Dual Universe project, but it's still in early alpha

Lag :(
---
It was ever thus. People were complaining about this in 2009...
---
Yes; the visual effect still shows. You just won't see the usual signal that you're being targeted
---
im soo glad they canceled the AT for years i was in pvp allances that would come to stand stills and operational deployments would dry up because the AT was taking up all the time of the command team, i just wish they canceled it years ago instead of now when i hardly even play eve anymore
---
To be clear the official forums have bitching as well, just not to the same degree as reddit, for the most part there are some seriously toxic people here, but you need to also realise that most of them are actually just taking the piss for the sake of what we colloquially call shit posting.
---
Basically don't let it bother you at all, its mostly bullshit.
---
That would be rude.
---
the events have gone downhill since they introduced the BPC s for the accelerators and forcing people to mine for hours to make one accelerator. I live in a big null sec alliance, there used to be a big rush for every Event, it would be hard to find a system where there is a site not alrdy occupied. You had neutrals come roam your space and warp in on those pve gilas.  now with the new grind events, people talk about 1 hour after the event started about it and then nada. Noone cares anymore doing them. Maybe some carrier pilots do them in a safe pocket. Most People run one site, realize that this is another shit event and don t bother with it. way to go CCP, create events that noone gives a dmn about it anymore 
---
If you're in a venture gas mining is probably the only thing that's worth your time. That usually requires exploration and scanning though.
---
Consider that when mining you're competing against guys that are multiboxing 5 rorquals sometimes or a 50-fleet of exhumers. It puts a huge downward pressure on ore prices.
---
Instead, I would recommend getting a VNI and doing sites.
---
Also, if you really want to mine in null you just join a nullsec corp. There are always people in Horde mining. The rats get cleared quickly by the fleet and you get fleet boosts so you mine faster.
---
I don't believe you get Jaspet in null.
---
Yeah, in FW, and in general LS, space, for sure!
---
Yea, and to be fair that’s where I’ve been the last year, so I’ve avoided most of the problems ) 
---
All these flavors
---
And you chose to be salty.
---
Do us all a favour and just biomass, retards like you are a massive part of the problem. You can't go around crying "the game is dying" and "all this shit is broke" and then advocate for RMT. 
---
Don't breed.
---
tree fidy?
---
Thunderdome was my very favorite part of eve. As someone who's had less time for the game over the years, I loved being able to hop on for practice and have almost instantaneous 10v10 even fights. It was a lot of fun for me and avoided the whole roaming to find content issues which caused me to leave Eve. It's a shame to see it gone. 
---
Just how I like my chips maite
---
Personally, I couldn't see myself quitting eve completely due to the years of investment. I certainly wouldn't give my stuff away, I'd rather have it buried with me.
---
Didn't care for AT after gambling was banned, it just got so much more boring.
---
There are visuals and audios for cargo scan.
---
How to identify:
---
1. There is a white beam ray from the scanner to ur ship. Sometimes is not there if in potato mode or very hard to see it in crowded areas (like Jita 44 undock).
---
2. There is a specific "declick" audio but u have to keep ur camera very close to ur ship/scanner ship (audio effects ran by ur client are dependent on the distance from the sound source - ship, station, citadel - and ur camera POV).
---
3. If u see a frigate or a cruiser hull with sensor booster effects on gates/stations, u can safely assume they are scanning (specially on Jita 44 and on the trade routes gates from it).
---
Oooh, really ? It’s not like Rorquals are killed everyday.
---
How that would be different from normal mining i ask. Keep the possibility of getting kill, point. 
---
Or just make a faction Titan rat spawn every ten minutes. Where’s the fun otherwise ?
---
Yup, me too. I'm a very casual player. I don't see all the Doom and Gloom people take about. What's the alternative? Nothing.... There really isn't a game that can itch the Eve scratch once once you get hooked.
---
Nobody's gonna give away their shit to some random.  Just proving a point here.
---
well said, sir.
---
It doesn't really have an effect on At ship hull prices. If anything it hurts them because a lot of the value was to use them in AT. The majority of them get lost and flown in the tourney.
---
For the most part the prices of the ships are set by an individual who hoardes a large number of them. They generally spike in price a few months before AT and stay high until AT finishes. 
---
This time around, Eve might actually be dying. 😥
---
In places like this you don’t hear about the people who don’t complain. You only hear the ones that do. 
---
this, now try to do it as a 5-10 man corp trying to build something for them without having list of blue longer that they can remember. 
---
Point still stands, WH’s are not broken, fizzier said as much in the TiS after show last Sunday.
---
So all you’ve proved is that a number of FC’s don’t know it’s intentional because they don’t follow the lore.
---
Maybe this is what ccp wanted all along, for us to go fu k ourselves
---
Move stuff out of containers remotely (or contract items from inside containers). Remote delivery. Default skins.
---
Consistent balance iteration, of course. Lol.
---
I want to emphasis the fact that the event is unsuitable for new player. And that's a big deal, you want to get into the game, you see nice ad of an event .. but it is just not for you  :/. 
---
I like the idea of challenging gameplay and as a experience player I enjoy doing the site. It is certainly doable in alpha cruiser with good fitting and nice piloting. But it is unimaginable for a new eve player to encounter any other outcome than dying without any hint about viable strategy to complete the site. 
---
I beleive that having gradual increase in difficulty from HS to LS to NS/WH would be much more interesting and engaging for everyone. 
---
And if you hope people do the event more than once a little reward might be nice but no reward and everyone enjoy doing it one time is cool too imo.
---
&gt; the Falcon always has been and still is better anyway 
---
ECM ships got screwed by the last change in ECM. I used to fly Blackbirds a lot, Falcons a few. Right now, Blackbird counts on the range to maybe survive, has 0 chance against dps ships and can't get away from small tackle. Falcon is in an even worse spot, with no range advantage it becomes a primary, juicy target. I'm guessing Widow is the same as Falcon, only worse as its prey is bigger and nastier.
---
I can understand why people complained about ECM being in an OP position, especially in small gangs. CCP went out and turned them from slightly OP to nearly useless. Falcon was a niche ship, too expensive to waste in big fleet engagements but a strong force multiplier in small gang. Now, the niche got smaller, it's 100% useless solo, it's primaried in small gang till it leaves the field. I'll half-heartedly agree that ECM needed a balance pass, but can someone fill me in the new role Falcons and Widows have? Blackbirds and Griffins are still used cause they're dirt cheap and one uses range as tank, the other speed and small size, but the rest? And of course, no one even remembers what Rooks are for.
---
Please, let me know if you've figured what Falcon/Rook/Widow is useful for in the new meta.
---
REEEEEEEEEEE
---
Do you do ok in the real world?
---
&gt;The trick is that most ppl haven\`t encounter that sound because is played by ur client on certain conditions:  audio effects are dependent on the distance from the sound source - ship, station, citadel - and ur camera POV. So, to hear it ur camera have to be as close as possible to ur ship or the scanner ship.
---
Why bother writing all of this? The development of the game has stopped and it's not unreasonable to suspect that CCP is about to cash out and move into milking mode to then shut EvE down when the cost of keeping it alive exceeds the profits.
---
They don't care about your criticism, man. The golden days of EvE are gone. Game has turned into RMT bot heaven. Devs know it and they want to make as much money as they can before it's finally over.

2019 is a year where there are a lot of interesting plans afoot. We’re not quite ready to talk about many of them just yet

And

for now it’s all about transparency.

We want to make our community aware of plans for 2019
---
Finally more resources for a "Rorqal Mining Standoff" - the winner will get AT-Rorquals that can warp in Inducore and are bubbleproof ...

You are the guy that thinks your new job is perfect. Give it a week.
---
I would ask for your stuff but I'm having a hard time with the ship and item hangars. 
---
I love scifi and games man. Seems like a natural fit. I do fine in the real world.  I've played a two week trial before so I have a basic clue that its not an action game per se.  I'm just wondering if its worth the time considering the bitching tbh. 
---
Why can’t you expand and move that window? Works well for the rest of us.
---
For the last 8 years my summers have revolved around the relatively obscure, semi-professional spaceship gaming tournament: EVE's Alliance Tournament.
---
I just stop reading at the first sentence and laugh a lot : "semi-professional spaceship gaming tournament"..... 
---
I guess wormholes and drifterholes are an option but goddamn we need that lowsec gate.
---
And maybe npc null sucking slightly less...
---
The real problem is there are too many self absorbed drama-queens with ego complexes so massive its bordering on collapse into a blackhole.
---
Bunch of self entitled pricks and CCP should ignore their wining and delete their AT winnings just to fucking spite them.
---
I mean see if literally any other games developers give even the slightest shit about your feelings either. The world's not nice, get the fuck over it and either pay your sub and enjoy the game or fuck off. Nobody cares.
---
I have a 1080i and a mechanical keyboard so I must be in the Top 50% of the pc master race, no? 
---
But it isn't, that's why I don't bother with it. Pvping for the sake of it isn't a good use of my time.
---
Case with supercaps is a bit different (you have same case, even more extreme in terms of stats, with AT ships) - supers are more of "use when it can work as i win button", people just tend to not use supers if there's high risk it won't result in a win - this causes bias in stats; most people won't yolo unsupported super on what likely is a cyno bait, but might very well try going with some cruiser/BC/BS - in case it isn't bait. More expensive, harder to replace and stockpile ship means lowering how much risk is too much to go in.
---
There's also practical difference between suiciding a ship that takes 3 weeks to build and a ship that takes about 2 hours to build, even if you have near-infinite resources. Not to mention, logistics, moving supercaps is much more difficult en masse than just packing bunch of subcaps in a JF and seeding them where you need. This means when there's opportunity to shoot someone who's not in your direct jump range, subs are usually closer and faster to use than supers.
---
It was a great fight. Tapirium came to brawl. I was in a baltec on 1 screen and carrier on another.  In potatoe mode it was all very manageable. I seen local peak at around 1200.  I was able to get damage on about 30 kills on each account. Otherwise shit died too fast.  I lost about 50 fighters. They did a great job of scram,web and keeping it. At most I only had 2 flights actually do damage at any given time. 
---
you will be one day
---
Edit: we talking about my precious gaming time. Will it be spent in powerful reverie blowing shit up and acting out a devious plan or will it be fly get blown up, fly sleep. Hide. Sleep. Fly get blown up. Coz really 
---
Why would people need to develop a space if they aren't mining / ratting?  You've made several posts lamenting the decline of pvp and now you are suggesting making pve easier?  
---
I bubbled you. It was fun. I was milliseconds away from scramming your boosher
---
Burn Jita is coming soon... so combine it?
---
That would be griefing. The miners would not put their pvp flags on. Stop being racist.
---
This could work, and I agree, we'd at least have to get Chribba to hold the prizes. There would also be the issue of preventing players who aren't in the AT from crashing the party, but from browsing Reddit for the past few days, there seem to be lots of people upset about losing the AT, and we could rally them in some kind of defence fleet to just hold all non-participants out. if we did this on sisi as you suggest, we could basically defend it with anything we want, because the markets are seeded with everything other than officer and deadspace modules being 100 isk. I do agree though, no matter what happens, it'll be great fun
---
"I couldn't go out and pvp because the FC's were having too much fun to come and hold my hand."
---
Oh what's that sound...? CCP...?  
---
Oh, just two cats getting it on... sorry nothing to see here.
---
The only use I had for twitch. Well, here's hoping eves not rip. :sadface:
---
Hyperbole? Name one change in the last 2 years that has helped that style of play. Closest thing I can come up with is triglavian ships and even then it’s a stretch. 
---
Ccp realized all of the 2 people that ran the AT are in the next round of layoffs and said fuck it
---
CCP has not have PLEX sale for sometimes... just sayin
---
Thanks for your feedback.
---
Also, what about a "funnel" system? You would set permissions for the box, (IE: ammo in this box funnel, models for modules box and mineral funnel for a mineral box.) And all you have to do when you get new inventory is hit the "funnel all" button on the item hanger it every charge goes into the box that has the charge filter etc etc? Applications would be for market traders, large large scale pvp looting and general moving. The item catagorys are already set in the game. 
---
This is pretty accurate unless you get in with a group that has half a brain.
---
I am very tempted to put my subscription on hiatus until CCP decides to stop milking us for very little effort. 
---
Fax are 1 point
---
Nice one cheers :) will look into the music
---
The winners should win loot boxes, opened via a golden alliance mining tournament winner's ticket and 13m isk. 
---
10mil sounds like 1 t1 frigate to me
---
Pretty much all the people who actually made the AT happen left or got fired. I would be shocked to see it return.
---
Go to Option &gt; Display , there is an option to enable for that
---
Look kids. This is what happens, when you're high on spod.
---
Bait and switch is inherently misleading. That's basically the whole point. I don't know how you could acknowledge it's a bait and switch but argue that it's not misleading.
---
But the special chests we buy will real money can only be opened with isk, to provide us with a sense of pride and accomplishment. 
---
This is genius! I love it!
---
Cheers for that :) and yeh will look into music for the next one

Hi Tahini!

capqu has zero ethics and would cream himself to get ahold of the ESI token database i have, and my corp itself has a high fraction of super pilots.

/u/ChribbaX we hereby summon you once more. you are needed!
---
Probably because bots complained about increased losses and threatened to stop farming, essentially causing a massive drop in active accounts.
---
The Falcon was kinda oppressive in "small gang" in the sense that most solo players had one cloaked nearby as back up to bail them out if things go south, which is incredibly cheesy. I'm glad to see that use for it gone. 
---
I guess you could still use it for support in BLOPs drops? The Falcon stays behind in an emergency and jams as many tackle ships with scrams as possible, to let the expensive BLOPs escape with MJD. 
---
Why have I not seen more commentary on the fact that EVE Online is a perfect vindication of socialist theory on why capitalism is unsustainable and destructive?
---
Activity tracker was released/made to figure out how to monetize parts of the game. Soon after loot boxes see an introduction to game. The future doesn't look good.
---
This was very helpful, thanks! ^^
---
Would be funny, screw any rules except ship point cost, and look at all the stupid stuff that happens
---
So you’re saying that EVE isn’t a sandbox game with player driven content? 
---
Are you sure you actually play this game?
---
I'm a Reddit badass because I implied I don't mine rocks? Lol you're trying so hard
---
Thats a business, you may *pay*.
---
It does *not* guarantee, that your money will be spent on developers for eve, instead of Hilmar's hookers or some mobile shit.
---
Who were these people? Is there a link to the story so I can learn more?
---
Jaspet is in some belts, all the ores spawn at specific security and below. 
---
But yeah, as an alpha, gas mining is probably best. Wormholes are good for this.
---
"Rebalancing." Yeah ok. Start by rebalancing the community team on their payrolls and I'll believe them.
---
Ah so you’re serious about deluding yourself into thinking anyone in skill urself is a big enough loser to care about some ESI trove or were remotely desperate enough to recruit the masterminds of of the insmother defense: warren and zigs. It’s a non-consideration and would never happen.
---
The simple fact of the matter is that killing tri was so fun largely because of how stupid and annoying tri fcs, especially SASH, were to work with and how cringeworthy their reddit posting was. Sahriah, yourself, and calmatt all come to mind. 
---
If you go to the search tab in assets you can look inside the containers

Rl is a better commentary?

so much for "oh it was just for gudfights"

i don't see a particular reason to relitigate _why_ you guys are pieces of shit. you are, and always will be.

you look like a fuckin moron regging just to bitch at me. what a bunch of tryhard losers.
---
dude ! killing is bad you know ! And it could be worst ! It could let player having fun into Eve online !
---
&gt;can’t afford a tournament devs were practically running for free
---
Those dev hours cost money. Money that can be spent on better things like making more micro transactions /s
---
Lets be fair, its their 're-balancing' that needs the most balancing
---
Eve in this mode half a decade already.
---
Thank you.
---
what about the abyss?
---
Probably one of the more cogent reactions to this whole mess!
---
You can enjoy the game and still agree with OP, I certainly do. I've had CCP shaft a lot stuff I've really enjoyed in pursuit of shiny new things that don't really get used by anyone. Every time it's happened I've moved on to find something new to do, but many don't find something or can't be bothered and just quit.
---
welcome to /r/Eve, a place very NOT representative of Eve
---
Ignoring it and being oblivious of it's existence does not equal being fine with it.
---
maybe because the Caldari are pretty damn successful, and no one can call either the Caldari or Gallente socialist.
---
Caldari being Capitalism without limit, to surprisingly good effect.
---
and Gallente being capitalism with a hard focus on liberal values, which while effective, is hurt by the same values as some groups in the Gallente have different...beliefs involving freedom....like indentured servants.
---
the only group that has a socialist feel to them would be Sansha, where everyone is equal......except the leader of coarse.  and lets be fair, no one likes that group of brain washed (literally) slaves.
---
if we wanted to expand, we could take note of how, despite its hypocracy(word of the day every day for Gallente), the gallente empire is still appealing to those in the minmatar (who....is basically an empire run by gangs/tribes rather than a properly structured government.  so they not really a republic in the normal sense of the word....at least not since they executed the last government).    the minmatar's tribal structure is rather close to the socialist "power shared by the people equally",  but shows its weakness in how easy it is for illegal elements to roam freely.
---
and Amarr.....Theology, oligarchy.  
---
so yeah, EVE actually shows capitalism(even outside of the fictional empires, if we look at players themselves), is very effective and pretty self sustaining.
---
is it destructive?  everything is destructive in some way,  the old and rusty must be torn down to make way for the new and vibrant.  repeat this over and over.    thats not dependent on a form of government at all, thats just human nature.
---
Because that would be taking a videogame about a million times too seriously 
---
hm...no quesiton is stupid huh?
---
whats a good solo fit for lv 1 and 2 minmatar resource wars.
---
pretty sure saying resource wars makes it a stupid question by default...but gotta ask anyway
---
&gt; well given that skill urself was actively spying on tri even after a bunch of corps left and moved north
---
Clearly we got on well enough without saeka “trump is a Russian plant fascists are gonna kill all the minorities” tyr retarding around. So that’s definitely not a perk.
---
&gt;so much for "oh it was just for gudfights"
---
If for fun translates to goodfights in your headspace that’s your fault.
---
&gt;i don't see a particular reason to relitigate why you guys are pieces of shit. you are, and always will be
---
Yeah and we both know this is because you had an absolute mental breakdown in tri chat about losing your azbel. I’m sure you could hamfist together some bEtRAYal narrative involving resets but the sad reality of your life is you only started actively repeating yourself ad nauseum and PMing our ‘low rent recruits’ after losing some krab structure nobody but you cared about. 
---
omg Carlos that was awesome ! &lt;3
---
Neat
---
They can fuck me themselves, the cowards.
---
LoxyRider, Bro, Logibro, etc. The AT was handled by community and EVE TV, and there are just very few people left on those teams as they have been reduced over the years.
---
Most of the time when I played eve I was too far zoomed out to even see my ship :D
---
isnt that the wrong direction? practically all of the bears I know make enough isk to not spend ir cash but a lot of the pvpers i know cba to pve/trade so spend ir cash?
---
&gt; people all feel like [...] ccp will do some shitty 5 minute number tweaking/changing a few stats balance in a few months.
---
Even that is being optimistic.
---
Their ROADMAP is literally "Little Things" and "Chat improvements".    
---
Seriously... A roadmap is supposed to be big, or even huge projects. Things that make people eager to play the game and look forward to new features.
---
Look at [Star Citizen's roadmap](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/roadmap/board/1-Star-Citizen). Whether you want to play the game or hate it or don't care about it, this is what a roadmap should look like: small improvements in the near future, big projects, clear goals, tangible goals, etc...
---
A few years ago, "Little things" and "Chat improvements" would be the last lines of an expansion patch notes, if even listed at all. They would be little things you'd discover when logging back in after patching the game, and now it's a feature listed in a ROADMAP? This is such poor ambition for your game...
---
A roadmap should be new ships, features people are excited about, long-term goals for your game.    
---
Remember the new jumpgate animation? The first T3 ships? Building our own stargates? A new colony? These are things you put in a roadmap. Not fucking "little things btw hehehehehe looks like I'm teasing you but I have no clue actually".
---
What's next?    
---
&gt; Roadmap Q4 2019 : "Fixing a typo in second mission of Sisters of Arc quest line"

*middle finger*
---
bought plex yesterday after waiting 2 weeks for a sale.  and now theres a sale.
---
*throws rock*
---
Just noticed this, but since when did 1 PLEX go up to $20? Wasn't it $15?
---
Never not wait for actual holidays
---
 Brutal.
---
just for you, random space person
---
Why don't you use the orininal link https://pastebin.com/iVjLZDDc?
---
That would cost 645 plex
---
nah, not worth the effort. this game has been over for quite some time. 
---
Any corps recruiting in USTZ, specifically EST?
---
&gt;with the player complaints about other player behaviour
---
did I miss something?
---
yeah T.T
---
*goes back to throwing rocks and wet cats at CCP's building*
---
no fanfest no AT now what no eve?
---
15 for gametime, 20 for plex
---
You have my pitchfork
---
So here's the problem with everything you just said:
---
&gt; CCP Veritas, the guy whose team was responsible for bringing in TiDi, eliminating a ton of lag, and fixing missiles had taken interest in the AT. In his **spare time**, he created a bespoke set of tournament tools that are still in use today    
---
&gt; I have a feeling that the reason the AT has even existed for the last two years falls entirely on like 3 people at CCP. 
---
and
---
&gt;I assure you that CCP knows what the AT is, what it isn't, and the value it has. 
---
Both of these things can't be true. What this means is that CCP has dedicated the bare minimum resources into the AT over the years, relying on "volunteered" time from CCP devs who actually care about the game. That's not a good or laudable thing. That's extremely exploitative and worrying and it shows that upper management doesn't actually understand or care about this event. 
---
#"important" in air quotes
---
I've played this game for over 6 years... I've done almost everything you could in this game besides the AT tournament. I've dedicated a portion of my life with 1000s of hours, theory crafted even more. I had hope in CCP, had hope for that final change that was actually good, that made this game so much better. Now after seeing this, all the comments, all the reactions, even my own... now I see all I've been looking at is a mere skeleton of what this game used to be with the dust forming. And for that my time has come.
---
EvE, you gave me great memories and better friends, but it's time to close the door on you for good.
---
Goodbye EvE
---
Most of the Devs who worked on AT did it in their sparetime. So the devs who worked on it really deserve praise for the work they put in.
---
Oh right. Sorry, my brain has the dumb.
---
They're focusing on the top 5% of baers.
---
It's simple.. People buy plex to sell it to people like that because they can afford to generate the ingame isk to support that lifestyle. So while it's aimed at the whales... The small fish support the community too. Then again in almost every major group I've met, I've met 1 or 2 credit card warriors that easily drop 5-10k getting into the game... 
---
Bad day?
---
i don't think we've ever even spoken, why do you think you know anything about me
---
FUCK OFF CCP
---
Am I... am I doing it right?

 !remindme 14 months 
---
No one was encouraging anyone to like anything, from what I could read, but maybe I missed something.
---
Not everyone lives on or relies solely on Reddit to get their news about the game.  The launcher actually provides some people with update or feature information.
---
But you'll probably just safely criticize them from a distance as well.  Which is fine, to each their own.  Enjoy eating your shit.
---
lmao just bury your shit together with you account so your pilot has a nice afterlife in valhalla. 
---
&gt; why do you think you know anything about me
---
i know you through your works, dingdong.
---
god i triggered the fuck out of skill urself. wonder how long it'll be before you guys backstab scourge.
---
Did a VIP site mined the ore payed the 25 mill bil only to get a agency supply drop. WTF atleast be fucking honest about the contents and dont hype people about skins and faction/deadspace modules. After 7 sites i still only have 2 tickets to show for it and 0 skins what is wrong with this event? So i made a support ticket and they are just calling it unlucky, fuck off...
---
"It shouldn't be able to take jump gates or wormholes"
---
Excellent well thought out idea...
---
Yep :(
---
But... what do we have left to do? Three giant fucking entities that allow for no wiggle room. hey! Let's go to high sec! Oh, they're all here because null is boring here.
---
Why are people fighting? For fun? Ok... that's fine. But if that's the only reason then why the hell are people playing EVE? Go play that Apex game. Where's the risk-reward? Where is the political turmoil?
---
"Yeah, I'm a leet pvper in EVE. I log my 20 rorqs on so I can make my supers and chase down fucking scrubs in subcaps down with them. Yeah, camping is supers is fun. Also I looooove having to wait 75645544672462746287 days to get through a goddamn armor timer. It's so exhilarating."
---
Like *fuuuuuck* man, let's be goddamn honest. The proliferation of super umbrellas and absolutely screwing the pooch on Citadels has made the game fucking boring. Shit needs to be able to explode, man. Not sit around for 4 days with your dick in your hand just to find out no one gives a shit about their 500th moon mining stations blowing up. They made the conditions that led to this.
---
This makes me sad and happy. I totally could have flown in the match against RE, but I was there for............................. V A P E N A T I O N!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I am feeling better now.

I don't get it.

You have my sympathy. Iceland's an interesting country. Though, if you're not staying long, there's not \_that\_ much to do there. (and it's, umm, fucking expensive, to use a technical term).
---
Vegas has a bit of a different feel, with the city more easily able to swallow up the attendees. (Vegas is like 3 times the population of Reykjavik. or double Iceland.) But it's still Eve nerds a plenty.
---
I think it was more a morale post for AT BOIS, and CCP. 
---
Dont leave mick.
---
This but in a random wormhole system. The exact system is released shortly before it starts and has to be accessible through k-space
---
Who leads fleets every day so you can f1 push?
---
I thought the players are the content?
---
This is really really bad, you should feel ashamed.
---
Alliance tournament will now not return unless it does so as a pay to play and pay to watch event.
---
CCP is clear that nothing will now be invested in eve unless it directly results in immediate revenue.
---
Sure they'll do fanfest global tour, it is a ticket event that pays for itself at the bars but expect no future content unless it is pay to own or play.
---
Probe windows are always open in null too for ratting and mining.
---
Please don't call CCPs roadmap a mess. The community team worked hard to put together that powerpoint.
---
hi havoc &lt;3 when will you make your flair a reality and join the best alliance in eve online
---
Who is salty enough to call people f1 pushers?
---
Webs and TPs have always worked just fine
---
You lot need to buy the fuck out of this and get plex back down to 1.5b per 500. Everything has lapsed to alpha and it's gonna stay there.
---
Do it minions, DO IT.
---
Delete this.
---
OP: "wormholer btw"
---
So was the content so different or they just had better loot?
---
"Pearl Abyss is going to allow us to run our company the way we see fit"
---
Within six months fires community staff and cancels AT.
---
If you want us to believe the first statement is true, then for at least the first year under their ownership it should be business as usual like the last two decades.
---
If instead, you make major changes like canceling the AT, then that's a giant red flare going up to everyone that they've got their hand all the way up your butt and are working your mouth like a puppet.
---
\&gt;when you huff the meme just right
---
1. Standing used to be important. And I wish it still was.
---
2. I'm all for more dynamic NPC wars. It could be modeled with some modifications after incursions. The sov of one faction could mean incursions of other factions. Militia pilots would have to intervene, as well as players supporting the NPC navy spawns.
---
3. Terrible idea to implement afterwards. Also the exploit to this would be to simply have a punching bag alt you simply apply the module you want to train. Skillsystems have to be implemented right from the beginning of the production, as they're a core element of gameplay and define the overall tone of the game heavily. Personally I'm a fan of "skill by use" in which you would automatically develop your specialisation according to your playstyle, by just using specific items often enough. This might also work for Eve, however, it's about 16 years too late to implement this.
---
Very much doubt a whole lot of people have looked into optimizing fits for those since it's almost literally isk negative to run them afaik.
---
If u write a ticket they may help you.. Heard stories about guys in same situation get something back(not sure if they get more Plex or cash back).. 
---
More krabite in wh yes ))))
---
Why not 50%... I'm greedy 
---
I mean its pretty evident from your posting?
---
can i has you're stuff????
---
I mean, it's pretty laughable that we want to be considered important in a video game?
---
&lt;3 Elise
---
I flew in a few ATs but then decided to shoot my shot at commentary and analysis and you saw my shitty ghetto stream and offered me a chance to take part in the presentation of the NT minor league, and then got a chance to do some more for AT 2018 (huge thanks also to Bei, Nash and everyone involved with the whole shebang). I love the eve tournament format and like you I'm obviously saddened that it's not happening this year but fingers crossed it will return in 2020. The tools that teams (and people running the things) have ~work~ but they're definitely not ideal. So here's to hoping AT comes back revitalised in 2020. 
---
New UK guidance states that influencers are now legally required to declare if they have received payment for the promotions they do, and/or the level of independent control they have over the content of the promotion.
---
The Advertising Standards Agency will be writing to you shortly.
---
By important I mean an important factor in creating content, not an important pen pusher or an important space famous dude. 
---
Frankly it might be better if the rats had bounties attached to them as even if your end lootbox potentially goes negative you stand a chance of being positive at some point. 
---
fuck 1.5bil lets move back to 300mil for GTC
---
Vert needs a replacement I see
---
Never, God-willing
---
Do you want to say that goons are efficient? 
---
If this is true then why not a player run AT?
---
Ccp replaced it so no
---
Depends if you're voting with your wallet or not. 
---
Ya totally. People are much more willing to forgive bad gameplay if there is a story line to follow. Take the story line of the expanse tv show, and put it in game and you will 10x your player base. Ofcourse, its not easy to write good story's. It's an art.
---
God damn man, posts like this just make me miss you even more. 
---
I can literally feel your love of the game through this post.
---
I'm glad you're still around here and interacting with us
---
Did wonder if he’d get it back
---
ah yes the 'skyrim mods' approach to game developement. Unfortunately opening the game code to community would both skyrocket the developement, but it would also be nearly impossible to control. 
---
CCP *could* go over the code submitted to try to find what it does before implementing... but after working a while in legacy enviroment myself, I can tell you that deciphering someone else's code when they *want* to hide something in it,is not easy. Nor time-efficient. So you might get a game that sparkles like a gem, but crashes to desktop every time you undock, plus The Mittani now suddenly has root access to your client and CCP gets the blame.
---
"Winning"
---
Lets keep it in the realm of possibility. i'm not asking for a stain gate, just a reasonable price to plex accounts that's not 2b per.
---
Guess its the alpha life for me until CCP close the doors next year.
---
can i have all your stuff?
---
Sig radius and speed affects damage of missiles rather than hit chance like with turrets but what you could do if you use pyfa is make a fit on there for the type of stuff you plan on engaging and then use the damage graph and put in your AF's speed and sig radius in those boxes to see a fits dps. Otherwise there is math to do if you would rather do it yourself. Not sure what all goes into it but i think EveUni has the formulas. 
---
I'll also question what on earth their rationale was (in the rewards department) to give out some Fireworks at 400 points. If you've grinded your way to 400 points, you'll already have many thousands of them.
---
aye, honestly i feel like i should be forceably ganked with no concord protection for even attempting the mode.  its that masochistic. 
---
but the Hurricane skin........must collect....them all.
---
*looks longingly at the self destruct button*
---
If it doesn't exist; DIY...
---
Every corp has this one guy who owns a Wacom tablet.
---
lmao get a load of this 1080ti pleb
---
heh i could, but na. legitimate transaction is legitimate. lesson learned =)
---
I feel like there was more truth to this early on when it was more about alliance vs alliance rather than AT only alliances. The BoB vs Star Fraction fight was an epic moment not just for the AT but for the game. More recent ATs have lost that.
---
They didn’t quite have 200 people, no. 
---
look into incursions. Just google around and see what you need. I hear those require fleets. Otherwise for group pve you will probably need a corp in a wormhole. I have only heard of pve fleets in those two places.
---
so does about every other T1 non-logi cruiser, except most of them better
---
turns out getting 200 million cash injection from PA would cause their 'records' to skyrocket eh, I wonder if there is a connection
---
100b titans at 300m/GTC was 333 months of game time for a titan
---
40b titans at 1.8b/500 PLEX is 22 months of game time for a titan
---
15 times cheaper than 2008 :(
---
Nice video, cool to see a ship not commonly used. 
---
when are they gonna make shield slaves
---
I've always wanted to build a sorta matchmaking system for eve but the problem is securing an area for people to have a fair match . I like the idea of doing it on the test server; at least if ur shit gets blown up no-one cares.
---
Question about the AT, is it canceled in both Iceland and the US, or is only one of them canceled?
---
Same for me.. I bought 2k plex Monday but i feel poor if i beg ccp now for 200plex xD 
---
cap boosters help when you get completely capped out but otherwise you could try a capacitor battery to increase neutralizer resistance but not sure if that would be the best option.
---
&gt; need simplify rules so close as possible to tranq eve, it will help viewers dont close stream. AT16 rule about 1 ship per setup was absolutely shit for viewers( who are we kidding, it was absolutely shit for most at16-participants)
---
I disagree with this - part of the reason the AT rules are needed is because tranquility is not balanced for 10v10 arena combat. Can you imagine how ridiculous it'd be if you could bring 2 bastioning marauders with T2 rigs, all deadspace hardeners, a couple of logi and a full wing of Gilas and Ishtars with T2 drones?
---
It'd be absolutely awful. The rules are needed to make the fights both interesting and, crucially, winnable. If you don't limit what can be brought, you end up with boring, dreadful stalemates.
---
In order to plex go down one of the 2 things need to happen.                
---
1. People need to buy more PLEX from CCP. Much more                 
---
2. Skill farms need to go or people having them have to be blocked from speculating plex up.                
---
Hint: Big skill farmers are driving plex prices up to increase price of final product (aka injectors).               
---
             
---
Why don't the eve players host their own AT?
---
NO AT NO PLEX
---
WE'RE HERE, WE'RE QUEER, WE DON'T WANT ANYMORE BEARS.
---
I would rather have the CSM than the AT. I mean I would rather have both, but if you think the CSM is useless you've probably haven't read the minutes.
---
One of the Worst I have participated in. At least permafrost has good rewards 
---
I'f I'm not back in 25 hours, please send help!
---
They could also use that spare time doing things that makes the company money!
---
What difference does the box make? It’s just an extra step to get it and almost all other pve has loot tables the same as boxes. 
---
Get rid of the UI team lmbo
---
GTC where 60 day. 
---
Not gonna lie, every year I see less of a reason to stick around. Only thing that keeps eve going for me is the people I've met over that time.
---
&gt; You lot need to buy the fuck out of this and get plex back down
---
Don't base your opinions on Eve from the subreddit.
---
there were about 190 in Panfam's carrier fleet
---
Are you telling me that it used to cost over 50 years of game time equivalent to buy a titan?
---
Again, it's laughable. If those "important" content creators were not around, then others would become content creators / content. Calling someone in a video game "important" is hilarious. Hey, you remember that one game.. 20 years ago, yea I was a raid leader in the top guild on the server. Man, I was so important!
---
The CSM is useless
---
Just skillfarm all your alts bro
---
It's not.
---
speaking from experiance...they will compensate you most likely. This means chances are high you get extra Plex if you file a ticket.
---
Instead, I would remove the two all expenses paid trips for each CSM member and use that money to host the AT.  In this day and age, you don't \*need\* in-person meetings.  Video conferencing works just fine.
---
If your CSM member needs two all-inclusive trips to represent you, you've got a bad representative.  
---
my hopes are that Thanos snaps away 100% of CCP
---
To be fair, before PA showed up those events were still pretty poopy.
---
Probably during the release of the gate to Stain extension.
---
&gt;all-expenses paid
---
CCP pays for the plane ticket and lodging, that's it.
---
Nah, tbh i'm pretty close to done, this is probably just the kick I need to cash out. 
---
Here is something for you to think about: CCP doesn't spend money on the AT and has never done, because it has always been something made by dedicated devs in their free time and without economic compensation by their employers.
---
Those where different times.          
---
You had static 10/10 giving billions each day (one is still present at entry from stain to catch)           
---
You could do production in poses without using any materials ... a bug that took quite a while to fix.                
---
... during those times you could buy a dread for 300-500mil.        
---
You cannot compare now and then. 
---
This is good - we just need to push it further. Titans are the only ships that matter, we want more people in the Content Club. 
---
They've always been so expensive that alliances can't replace fleets readily, so they can't afford to risk them. But that's changing, slowly; we saw risks in UALX and X47 that led to great fights. 
---
Imo we should double down on this trend and aim for 10b titans by 2020. This would let us get some real throwdowns in sovwars on a regular basis. 
---
Agreed, it is completely useless. It's so useless, you probably shouldn't vote for the CSM. Why bother?
---
perhaps it's for the better? first hardcore players leave, then the more passive ones realize there is absolutely no content after that...
---
couldn't you run the tournament itself on the test server, where non-consensual PVP is banned?  All players could transfer their ships and gear to the trusted third-party on the live server, and anything that dies on the test server is removed from the third-party's cache
---
No, but you can listen to turbokrabs flaunting their overstated isk/hours. :P
---
many tears shall be shed as we weep for the pain of our ancestors 
---
EveNT is already a thing, but without CCP support for rewards, organization, server access for training and all, live desk commentary it's a lot harder and a lot less valuable for players to spend hundreds hours and trillions of isk in practicing and preparing in a cheap, meaningless AT.
---
This!! CSM is worthless anyway. Maybe stop paying for their vacations and you could afford AT.
---
come back mtn ill vouch u
---
@CCP_Bedshitter
---
to be honest, I'd really love to see an event like that with 1 condition - they shittalk CCP during every break and discuss how incompetent CCP is, preferably on a CCP steam...
---
plot twist - CCP is actually just retarded...
---
no because stuff explodes in this game and you don't get it back. People participate in pvp that would be considered griefing in any other game but is totally normal and keeps the economy in check. Suicide pvp gangs even run around in high sec and kill people knowing that they themselves will die to concord afterwards. Losing a fitted battlecruiser hurts a lot more than a frigate or destroyer. Also just cause you can fly the hull doesn't mean you should. make sure you have skills for the correct defense and offense systems for the hull as well
---
You just got baited by Reddits biggest IDOT troll. Anything querns_gf say should be blocked or completely ignored.
---
There's been a few, most with success. EVE-NT comes to mind...even GSF has had their internal Anger Games. The problem with player-run ATs is that they don't have the resources that CCP does for internal quality control.
---
Good thing I haven't answered him then.
---
Uh, I'm pretty sure you have no clue about either number.
---
I disagree with you, but that's a subjective opinion of your take on the alliance tournament and you are entitled to it.
---
Imagine every goon being efficient when it comes to krabbing. Titans would truly be the new frigates
---
By the way OP, this is one of our premier community representatives. He is part of what we call the CSM. They get free vacations to Iceland to go "work long hours" with the devs and make improvements to the game. They are supposed to be the bridge between us and the devs. But instead of taking their position or the community seriously they just shit post and smug about their free vacations and how righteous the CSM is.
---
People where complaining about single column for account list. 
---
CCP's got a month in my book to fix stuff - that's when my first account is due renewal for subscription and when I'll make a decision.
---
capqu wins reddit again
---
Unsub'd and biomassed and I don't even like hookbills. 
---
Funny because it's the opposite story of VYDRA team – we founded alliance just to do some troll SOV, but accidentally got into tournament :)
---
The question now is how many rorquals do you have and how big your skill farms are, not how good your killboard is.
---
Get rid of toxic Eve players or non-playing constant complainers. Shutdown /r/Eve 
---
they are 1 second ticks but yeah
---
Not actually true.
---
Not entirely, at least.
---
That isn't why they cancelled it though. They just don't have (more like don't want to devote) the resources to the event anymore. I wish the CSM would give us a little more insight into what the heck is going on behind the scenes, you know, do their damn jobs.
---
Do you honestly think the CSM isn't already on the chopping block?
---
people are never a waste of space in a fleet unless you are day 1 and don't know how to press f1. Any megacorp will take you and throw you in a fleet.
---
hey capqu remember when skill urself declared tri too shit to practice with you and we fucking beat you into the ground?
---
Charitable response:
---
Probably because they're running in a tiny screen. 
---
asshole response:
---
because they're botting, and the bot breaks if they do.
---
ECM drones are like a week or 2 train time from a base character
---
CSM cannot say much due to NDA they had to sign.       
---
They are obligated by law to say nothing. 
---
Isn't this the smallest discount they have ever offered?  I don't remember seeing a sale under 15% in the past.
---
The CSM usually gets announced by now. How much you want to bet that gets sacked next. Or better yet, the Iceland meeting aspect of it gets axed.
---
I know, I’ve tried but then gotten stuck on the “you now have 200GB of raw data, wat do?” problem. I may be due to try again. 
---
TERRIBLE
---
That's essentially most of the expenses.
---
inb4 "but food and beer!"
---
That's what most of people involved in the tournament have been told, not once but several times, but other players more involved in the behind the scene; but please do elaborate if you can or as much as you can, wouldn't like to be spreading misinformation.
---
OBSESSED
---
no
---
They could probably save even more by getting rid of the CEO.
---
What do you do in a sandbox when they take out all the sand?
---
You're wrong on one count: Horde has 4 nyxes now. 
---
What have the CSM accomplished then?
---
i have never seen a pacifier on the battlefield but i'm thinking three flights of t2 drones would take awhile to get rid of. 
---
That was an ... interesting choice of music. :D
---
Nice work! Death to all gate camps!
---
It was only about 120GB normalized for me. The other space was just indexing the shit out of it.
---
i'll sell you my 20 PE1 killmark leshak so you can know what fair victory actually tastes like.
---
I BLAME THE GOONS! GRRRR
---
EvEwHo!!
---
I have seen an announcement and two different pings on discord over the past month about this. BL are our friends but none of us are in a major war, they have a commitment to supply there pilots with targets. You need to have alliances shown on your overview or only shot what FC says.
---
Its a bit messy but standings sometimes don't take effect till downtime, so changing standing for one fight is not realistic.
---
Unsurprisingly, CCP remove yet another thing that would convince people to log in. 
---
You think, for example, the devs who were at the eve nt commentary paid for their own tickets? 
---
I got five on it. 
---
Yeah because beer and food is so cheap on an island where almost eveything is imported. 
---
I wasn't aware that 'literally having one today' was not having one for some time.  
---
Imagine paying for people like brisc rubal to slob around iceland and do nothing productive for a week.
---
No poors.
---
Wait i thought it was a time problem and not a financial one? 
---
What benefits or requirements for something else did you have before that they took away?
---
This is why eve is broken and ccp  needs to fix that shit rather than promote a fixed tournament
---
Honestly asking, why is it so bad? Confession that I've only seen it from the outside (on a quick tour of Reykjavik). Quite interested, given that externally it appeared all-new.
---
&gt;A few years ago, "Little things" and "Chat improvements" would be the last lines of an expansion patch notes, if even listed at all. They would be "little things" you'd discover when logging back in after patching the game, and now it's a feature listed in a ROADMAP? This is such poor ambition for your game...  
---
&gt;A roadmap should be new ships, features people are excited about, long-term goals for your game.Remember the new jumpgate animation? The first T3 ships? Building our own stargates? A new colony? These are things you put in a roadmap. Not fucking "little things btw hehehehehe looks like I'm teasing you but I have no clue actually".  
---
&gt;What's next?
---
All memes aside, this hits home and hard... I remember the awe of discovering the modular looks of T3s, new nebulas, sounds (RIP old old old gate noises "WWWWAAAAHHTTttooooooooo"), the BIG expansions... CCP productivity is gathering pace downhill and is about to hit the tree at the bottom. Have they run out of ideas? have they given up since PA sunk their claws in? without a doubt, EVE is still playable and fun but I can see it getting veerrrrry boring sooner than we like to hope.
---
And MY torch!
---
No of course, and that's a valid point; but I was aiming more at all the organization, setting of rules and all the stuff that has to be made before the tournament, and the work during the broadcast made by CCP on the final weekend/s when they did that.
---
Why are people so dumb they just missed your meta?
---
Go outside, bro. Take your pitchfork with you. 
---
No, because when GTC's were 300m you could produce a titan for ~40b
---
who are you
---
I stopped doing the events a while ago. Its just not worth it anymore. After 2+ years of events and feedback, they keep repeating the same mistakes. The weird thing is: Sometimes they get it (almost) right and you think they have finally figured out how to make good events, but then the next event is a dumpster fire again. Its like they are having amnesia in regular intervals, making them forget past development experiecene. The event development is a mess!
---
:) thanks
---
drekavac means a demon in slavic culture. it's come for the soul of children who die unbaptised.
---
and i knew about an orchestra song about a demon taking the soul of kids. the song in video is.
---
Let me drop my 3 Nyxes on your frigate gang about it. 
---
What point is that?  That you have cognitive development issues?
---
more like they don't want to devote the resources because they don't care about that sector of gameplay anymore, because it's obvious they haven't since about 2013
---
2.1 b tick bruh
---
Community interaction would be great..
---
Shame about the community team.  I'm sure if ccp even had 1 community lead who was an intern or whatever, a lot of this poor communication would be resolved. 
---
Everyone that's splooging all over themselves for making funny ironic comments about "PGL complaining about disconnects only when it affects him lololololol" need some serious work on your reading comprehension.
---
The guy made an objective statement about how the disconnects impacted everyone in that fight. He specifically mentions the impact it has on both sides. Nowhere in his post does he cry about them only losing because of the disconnects.
---
So are people not allowed to raise legitimate concerns about game issues just because they have impacted people on the other side in the past?
---
Jesus Christ get over yourselves and go 1v1 PGL at the sun.
---
Just take the airline snacks duh
---
Personally, I think blaming PA is giving CCP too much credit. They've been shooting themselves in the foot for a while now.
---
As bad as 10 was, this worries me more.
---
Have you tried gitting gud at it
---
Didn't it cross your mind that they plan to remove both?
---
REMOVE KEBAB
---
Burn it all down, turn it into glass and then throw rocks obviously
---
Enough to make Rockstar proud. 
---
Nice, I'm always happy to see gatecampers die in a fire :D
---
Eve is stale and ccp does nothing but try to give false hope to keep the money coming in. I finally played apex legends yesterday with some friends and I had more fun then I have playing eve in the last 6 months.
---
Anyone with a a little hope left in eve I'd suggest wh space too as well I lost all hope of this shell of a game going back to what it once was. 
---
Wormholer btw
---
Maybe if they didn't lay off 800 people someone would have time for it.  
---
Not that I'm trying to shut you down, but it's probably a bit of both
---
Sounds like maybe you shouldn't be a recruiter then
---
Why are you looking for achievements of the CSM when it's role is to provide for input to CCP ? Sure is hard to find big old glorious statues of what great the CSM has achieved, but if you think CCP is out of touch with the game just imagine what it would be without the CSM. CSM is the first line to bring subject CCP want to avoid (last meeting or so they especially worked on having a low sew meeting on the schedule, because you know grrr nullsec players only want rorquals and nyxes). Here CSM 13 minutes :
---
&gt; Brisc Rubal goes on to say that other games have war mechanics to offer PVP but eve is such a pvp
---
centric game that this mechanic has become a niche mechanic which lies outside of the intended
---
original design. He feels that this is not a mechanic which anyone would be happy with removing
---
altogether, however it needs to become something that is useful and not just a means of griefing.
---
Giving victory conditions to both sides. giving them both an incentive to fight is something which
---
needs to trigger the end of the war.
---
&gt; Sort Dragon brings up an invulnerability of some kind to avoid a permadec, such as paying a fee of
---
some kind
---
&gt;  Suitonia feels that it needs to be tied more to structures
---
OH LOOK WHAT IS IN THE PATCH NOTE ABOUT WARDECK CHANGES ... And i've just took like at the first topic, you can get a look at what was brought on the table about several topics. The CSM cannot fix the game for CCP but it for sure is playing its role of a consultative group.
---
CSM XIV - An Update! 
---
Coming soon :D
---
It's quite sad that CCP has responded more here on Reddit than on It's own website forums were players have been answered with silence.
---
Well, at least I can report back that someone at CCP is still alive........
---
Reddit is constantly pissed off about everything in the game. Dont let them discourage you
---
Ditto Man!
---
Harpa is under construction this spring/summer. The world tour is actually one of the better things ccp has put forward in the last year. 
---
Is that an Amazon Facility?
---
Have you tried, actually posting quality content in this sub? Yeah, you suck.
---
Worse than worthless. On top of all the issuess that come from giving propietary information to players there's the fact that whenever ccp makes a controversial change only those csm that are agree with it speak up while the rest who might or might not agree with it keep silent.
---
Maybe what you are offering doesn't apeal anyone?
---
You could have posted this on r/showerthoughts and I would still have downvoted you.
---
People tend to overlook the single most daunting aspect a new player faces.  Real time skill training.  It fucking sucks.  And as long as it exists (and it will forever), then most of the few new players arent going to stick around.  There is a different generational mindset now to the one that existed when eve was in its prime.  People want fast paced.  They want games they can get right into.
---
Look at Warframe as the perfect example.  For ever player Eve loses, WF gains three.  Its fast, its pretty, its easy to get into, and you can hop in and be in a fight 30 seconds later.  This is what you need nowadays to gain players.  Not some slow and tedious levelling process.  New players dont want to spawn in space in the middle of the starter zone then say, "Whelp, in 6 months ill be able to do some pretty cool stuff."
---
Yeah you're absolutely right. This really bums me out, as I mainly held onto my main because the AT was still something I wanted to do. 
---
Or, you know, just jump from T-NN to Saminer like a normal human being.  Neither one of those stations is even mildly difficult to jump to.
---
useless would be a step up from what we're currently having.
---
Nice edit.
---
You mad? 
---
According to aryth, a typical summit sets him back a couple thousand bucks.
---
What meta no meta here. 
---
How broken would be 24 hour Omega for all accounts be I wonder? Sure there might be a lot more cloaky campers that day. 
---
My guess it would not advantage true newbies much at all though and instead favour returning veterans. Its not like a newbie would gain much from 24 hours of training / using Omega skills, but returning vets would get to utilise all their existing skills.
---
Playing devils advocate, perhaps people would use it to extract accounts they have had sitting idle and normally would have no reason to resub. I wonder if there are any other ways to take advantage?
---
&gt; - SKINS will grant hull bonus like bonuses.
---
I see you've played BDO too. 
---
TBH player ran tournaments are just a circle jerk. 
---
I feel like there really isn't a good way to do it. I've thought about a high sec AT using wardec mechanics. Where a third party would have two corps, one for each contestant alliance. The third party would then add people to each team on equal numbers. The third party also makes the fleets the participants would be in. The wardec starts then the AT  is at a safe.
---
But then there's combat scanners, gankers, suspect logi, people might say they're following the rules of what they're bringing them bring something else entirely... Plus the third party could be biased and provides the safe location to someone like goons, CODE, or one teams enemy. 
---
That would suck.
---
Who?
---
I think you are getting lucky with your opponents. All I'm seeing is 300m passive gilas.
---
There are some guys running in 5b vedmak/curse setups
---
Is there  different pvp rooms based on tier? 
---
How about a 4v4 Starcraft: Brood War tournament featuring alliance teams?
---
This is, of course, implying that CCP can get together enough to turn the test server on, which they almost couldn't accomplish for their [i]own[/i] AT, much less other player events last year. IIRC both Theomachy and another player event got kicked off Thunderdome because they apparently didn't have the time to put a developer on the case to get it working.
---
When i was new, the AT showed me that PVP in EVE can be more than ganking and gate camping. I created an PVP alt because of this.
---
I’m new enough not to know any better. But I understand where you’re coming from, I’ve had similar experience to you but in other games. I’ve been around for let’s say 2 weeks, yeah not long enough to be able to judge or see any difference 
---
Tell us in one sentence why someone should join your Corp. 
---
😓😓😓
---
that is how i used to make my isk, with my alt Poopandpee, many years ago. It kept my 5 accounts subbed, it was a good time. I do see how it can ruin the game for new players, but it was a game mechanic, and i used it :D
---
Somehow I thought about the same thing when I read the title.
---
Hello!
---
Sorry pal got a little mtn-ette on the way eve no worth 
---
All that was lost has now been regained
---
Most of the changes they made up until recently have been net positive. I don't have as much of a negative view about it, but it is obvious they are moving further and further away from dealing with the real issues Eve is struggling with.
---
Thank you for volunteering. I expect prizes, commentators, a time frame, a rough location, rules and all the relevant sign forms to be posted to Reddit and the Eve forums soon.  
---
Please link.
---
By Icelandic Law...yes. Under Texas Law, it is an exception to the NDA to break it for the betterment of the Eve Community.
---
9y 12mo... some might call that 10y
---
&gt;You just got baited by Reddits biggest IDOT troll. Anything querns_gf say should be blocked or completely ignored.
---
Aww, I'm blushing.
---
because weve learned that no matter what you do, ccp doesnt care anymore...
---
For CCP is perma ban for this specific person. 
---
Circle jerks, excuse me!!!! A friend in need, is a friend indeed. Or as the ancient kindergarten song goes, “If you want to be my friend put my dick, in your hand” 😆
---
Hello all. Long time lurker, first time poster here. I've  owned the game through Steam for about a year now and I was wondering if there was any way to transfer my account to just run through the EVE site? I'd like to partake in some of the sales offered through the EVE site, and I'd prefer every dollar I spend on this game to go to CCP. (It looks like they need it more.) Thanks in advance.
---
Back when people were still motivated enough to log in.
---
Idea for both destruction and prize pool: /u/ChribbaX takes all entrants ships / implants / boosters whatever on tranquility, copies it all over to sisi and distributes accordingly.
---
Anything destroyed on sisi is moved into the prize pool on tranquility. /u/ChribbaX returns undestroyed items after tournament and distributes prizes.
---
Back in my day we just adapted and enjoyed the game.
---
3 incursus or rifters just under 3.5mil each 
---
Would remove the input from Goons at the same time, so I'm all for this....
---
depends on your definition of recent
---
someone in the first complaining thread posted a list of the balance changes made in the past year and other than tweaking a few stats on about a dozen ships (which did need it) and implementing the ADC, there's been about no work on that front in over a year and a half
---
and the iteration time on small balance changes and tweaks *really* shouldn't be three to six months if they actually cared about that sector
---
I mean if he's paying for an escort, that's on him.
---
I smell a bitter ex-girlfriend
---
I think it depends on the GM. Iv'e had tickets responded to within an hour , others left open for weeks.   
---
My alt got banned for 30 days.   
---
I had no idea why.   
---
Took CCP over a month to reply to my petion stating i used an expoit.   
---
I wasnt even aware of the exploit they were talking about , showed chat logs showing i had been given roles ingame.   
---
The gm responded that he had no log of me using an exploit but was confident i did.   
---
Took billions of assests i had stolen , and banned my account temporary.   
---
Some of the Gms are awful others seem to be legit  
---
Really hit and miss with the gms
---
i always thought the AT should be 250 vs 250 fight anyhow. what alliances can gather a fleet?
---
That’s actually good for the American taxpayers! We would be better off if he was in Iceland all the time!
---
Really as long as you have cloak 4, which isn’t a crazy long skill train. You’ll be able to function. I would max your scanning skills out. But at least get all your astrometric skills to 4 before trying to get one of them to 5. 
---
I generally don’t do much in the hole. We have a lowsec static so I’m usually just flying around in a frigate or destroyer. 
---
What I’ve found though, is that most wormhole corps are more tight knit than others. They have to rely on each other for almost everything. That forms great bonds and friendships. Which is the best ship
---
ITT: people who would rather - and probably did - jam pencils in their ears than actually find out what they're talking about.
---
The same idiots who say 6ft instead of 5ft 12, probably
---
I kind of feel one of the NPSI groups like Spectre Fleet could sponsor and referee a tournament. They've done one before.
---
\&gt; There whole argument about getting rid of community engagement is that it saves money. 
---
When they announced these things last year the biggest feature they harped on was more events *closer to where players live*. If they made cuts to things after that, thats a different story, but I have yet to hear CCP say anything about cutting Fanfest Iceland as a cost saving measure. If anything, with the new event locations, it may cost them about the same or more.
---
That isn't to say CCP hasn't made cuts to community events (obviously), but just because they cut one thing doesn't mean they cut everything all the time.
---
You have every skill to 5 for 24 hours.
---
(And basically fly every ship/try stuff out without having to wait for sp)
---
Well maybe PA will stop Hillmar from starting up so many failed projects that just burn money and people, things that most of us saw from the announcement of them that they were going to crash and burn anyway. How can they even get project X off they ground, they can't even fix local chat or the launcher ?
---
not fair, only a handful of Korean alliances. 
---
Very nice fight
---
Drekavacs are amazing ships =)
---
But who would tell them how their game works? CCP keeps these unpaid consultans around for very selfish reasons: they're saving them a lot of money.
---
or a politician.
---
FRUMP.
---
Do you think the cancellation of the AT speaks to difficult work demands already on these devs? That it's not about the players but about unpaid labor?
---
Make the round 5 minutes long and allow PVP, but with panic allowed.
---
I'm pretty sure some were salty AF with something something ads
---
We lost the objective, but it was a great fight.
---
Boy it would have been nice if they had Lead with that information in the announcement. 
---
Yeah because abyssal PvP is working so great most time zone doesn't have enough people running them for it to be active.
---
Nowadays they just put a plex sale on the day after pissing off their customers.
---
Thats it, a decade too late fix for a problem everyone had been pointing at for years?
---
Really proving useful.
---
Studio rentals aren’t exactly confidential information. I know more or less how many accounts are unsubscribing around me or will not resubscribe for AT and that’s a fucking lot and that’s just around me. At least half of last year’s at tryhards leaving the game straight is reasonable imo. 
---
In fairness, he is probably also upgrading his hotel room.
---
Iceland has a dope craft brewing scene actually. 
---
yes, non-consensual pvp is bad for ccps new marketing strategy.
---
You mongoloid, that's on CCP fault to take 10 years to look at war decks, not the CSM
---
My post is intentionally multi-faceted, suggesting one thing and laughing at it at the same time.  Dropping ideas on how to make things better and at the same time musing at how could CCP fuck things up a little more.  That moment of switching gear brings the tired brains back online.  But mostly that’s just how my head works all the time (rather than me being an actual smartass).  And also, I’m aware of being a knows-naught on the big scale, but trusted that if I actually dropped a good seed here, it would be picked-up.
---
In all honesty, I wish there would be a way to have more on-the-spot, rather irrelevant but still fun PvP.  And I think a lot of players are avoiding PvP for the same reason people are not running the Guardian’s Gala : they know they’re gonna be ISK and time negative, so they have no incentive to do it.
---
If you have time to spare, I’m curious to learn how standings used to matter more.
---
I think the cancelation has to do with the work pressure it puts on the few devs that dedicate their free time to it and already have a lot on their hands with their regular work; I don't think it has that much to do with "unpaid work" but with "way too much work" for them, that on top of it don't have CCP's support to do it.
---
Not sure what players have to do with this tbh, I didn't quite get what you meant there.
---
Definitely a WIP
---
Maybe
---
But I would have to log in to shoot at the monument...
---
The tried and true method is to join a large blob, make a lot of friends there and then break off from the alliance with your space friends to form your own corp and join the same or another alliance.
---
Well that was a bit overly dickish. I'm all for a good ribbing, but fuck, dude.
---
Agreed. We should only elect players who are above reproach, like Imperium CSM members. As we all know, not one Imperium candidate has been removed for leaking. Others? Less stellar track records. Imperium candidates are the only safe choice.
---
It's the same thing that attracted them, last time.
---
Seriously hope not, Abyssal arenas are already a pretty shitty adition to the game.
---
Fuck, let this game die. I don't want to keep playing over half assed promises and get disappointed when they keep screwing us over again and again. Just let this game die 
---
should all shoot the concord station &gt;=D copy the minmatar
---
Remind me again how long we've had the CSM Mr Mongoloid.
---
Not sure what you mean by "last time", because the recruitment chat channel has always been a shitshow full of assholes.
---
16 or 17 plex for all omegas.
---
What part of consultative don't you understand ?
---
' i guess a lot of you won't care ' well you something right for once Capqu
---
While Eve is a useful model for other things, it does not simulate a global economy very well because resources are literally infinite. 
---
That, and it’s a good demonstration that when people have access to shared wealth that they will cheat and take more than they are owed from Corp hangers. 
---
I'm literally shaking right now
---
That sounds fun, specially as you said it’s a tight knit. This is why I didn’t join a Corp with 1000s of players, being just another fish in the pond is no fun either.
---
That's a good point. Korean alliances are only allowed to have three team members.
---
Man, this hurts.  Regardless of how Citadels panned out, this was the last time I've seen actual ambition from CCP.  Not only did we get a slew of structures that really shook up the meta and infastructur, but we got a massive capital overhaul with new, innovative gameplay.  Carrier mechanics are dope.  The first keepstars were awe-inspiring....
---
...And then there was zero follow through.  So little that the finer problems in the new meta were allowed to rot the foundations of Eve for years.  Bi-weekly balance patches would have given us the best game Eve has ever been, but now we have Rorqual-&gt;Titan online; and the hangover is going to be massive if / when it gets fixed.
---
No SP requirement and laid back environment where you decide how to play the game that you pay for, monthly. Establishing the infrastructure to provide things like PvP and Mining fleets w/ boosts and SRP, mission/exploration support and guidance (decent way to introduce folks to fleet activities), module and ore buybacks, free ships, etc. 
---
Wasn't one sentence, but whatever. 
---
Link to these reviews pls? 
---
I actually feel like eve is dying for the first time. Largely due to CCP / CCP's parent company. it's going to be a god damn shame when this game finally closes it's doors.
---
More like Alliance snOREnament amirite?
---
If the csm can’t even get an AT then it’s useless.
---
I can go along with that. Piles of the skulls of your enemies is a bold and expressive choice of decor.
---
In all that time they've achieved CCP taking a look at wardecs, well worth the consultant fee.
---
Aryth just buys out all the escorts from the pimps in the surrounding area and .01 krónas any remaining pimps and free agent escorts out of business, then uses his own stock when applicable.
---
This just sounds like Brave Horde or karmafleet without the null fun. 
---
Well I guess I won't waste more time arguing with you.
---
Buy all the plex guys, maybe they'll make enough to bring back the AT! 
---
Sorry bud only managed to get 3/4 FCs!  
---
I realized it wasn't worth killing the D-tier FC after the A,B, and C tier died and you were getting repped, resorted to killing 4 jackdaws every 10-15 seconds instead.
---
yeah but you see, that's at least 3 months of work from 7-8 ccp employees that are dedicated to the task that only nearly ten thousand eve online players enjoy and watch, basically a huge waste of time
---
I suppose? Some folks don't want null, at least not yet.
---
Please do, I enjoy the laugh.
---
OK what he meant was "explain in one sentence why someone should join *your* corp and not the 6000 other corps that do the same vague kinda everything kinda nothing"
---
what makes you and your corp special 
---
Hes not wrong.
---
That option would/could still be there with loot rolling.
---
Just force people to be in range of loot to roll on it and prevent quick warpouts upon winning. Just blap the person and steal the loot if you want it that bad.
---
It not taking any options off the table for you. This is 2018 were talking about.
---
*Wow*.
---
&gt;maybe because the Caldari are pretty damn successful
---
The Caldari suffered a fascist takeover that lasted the best part of a decade because their corporate executives began straight-up mass-murdering members of an activist movement that was campaigning for better labour conditions and against high-level corruption. This led to Tibus Heth seizing control of it and installing the Provists, an ultranationalist government that was not only vastly more corrupt than the one that preceded it, but also unmanageably violent and xenophobic. The Provists forced the State to into an unwinnable war over a planet that held and continues to hold no strategic or economic value that *still hasn't ended* despite the fascist government being removed from power. 
---
The war was so economically destructive to the Caldari that it led to them nearly bankrupting their entire country and subsequently putting themselves tens of trillions of ISK (and I will take this opportunity to remind you that a single ISK represents potentially thousands of units of conventional planetside currency) in the hole to the *legendarily* untrustworthy and toweringly insane Amarr Empire who - for their part - were forced to bail them out so that they wouldn't lose their only ally against the entente of the technologically superior Gallente Federation and the highly motivated Minmatar Republic.
---
&gt;and Gallente being capitalism with a hard focus on liberal values(plus a strong federal government which keeps a distance from ownership. big difference between it and socialism)
---
The Gallente Federation's obsession with liberal values and free market capitalism led on multiple occasions to utter disaster. The entire first Gallente-Caldari war was caused largely by entrenched lobbyist groups representing Gallente corporations getting upset that the Caldari were outperforming them and pushing the Senate to enact sanctions. When the Caldari terrorist group the Templis Dragonaurs bombed the underwater city of Nouvelle Rouvenor in retaliation, the Gallente Federation suffered a coup by an ultranationalist movement that was - to no-one's surprise - unmanageably violent and xenophobic. They then began a sustained orbital bombardment campaign and drove the Caldari off their homeworld, igniting a two-century enmity between the two nations.
---
Currently, the Gallente Federation is ruled by a corporate executive who's intentionally defunding Federal military organisations *in the middle of a defensive war* so that he can use their underperformance to justify awarding massive security and R&amp;D contracts to his own company. He's also funding the Black Eagles, who are essentially a combination of all the worst elements of the 1950s-1980s CIA and the House Un-American Activities Committee. Oh, and he seized power by forcing a surprise election after the previous president attempted to nationalise the Federation's military-industrial complex because it was found to be intentionally sabotaging peace negotiations between the Gallente Federation and the Caldari.
---
&gt;the only group that has a socialist feel to them would be Sansha, where everyone is equal......except the leader of coarse. and lets be fair, no one likes that group of brain washed (literally) slaves.
---
The Sansha are a hyper-racist fascist society that believes certain groups of people literally don't have a right to sentience. That's hardly socialist.
---
&gt;minmatar (who....is basically an empire run by gangs/tribes rather than a properly structured government. so they not really a republic in the normal sense of the word....at least not since they executed the last government)
---
The Minmatar Republic is fact a tribal republic (the term "republic" does not necessarily imply democracy), and their history is significantly shaped by the imperialist colonialism of the Amarr Empire, who are still attempting to lay claim to their territory, their resources and their bodies. They executed members of their previous government because they had literally been found to be working with the colonisers.
---
&gt;but shows its weakness in how easy it is for illegal elements to roam freely.
---
In both EVE and the real world, this is very a common problem with societies that were victims of colonialism. It's largely because colonies were established for the good of the colonising society, with very little thought given to the people who were being colonised. When the Minmatar Republic finally won its independence, it had to rebuild its entire civilization from scratch without access to benefit of the advanced resources and centuries of economic development that their colonisers never shared with them.
---
&gt;and Amarr.....Theology, oligarchy.
---
The truest expression of the unholy union between fascism, capitalism and religious fanaticism. People often try to draw parallels between the Federation and America, and there's some merit to it, but I think there's a much better parallel in the Empire.
---
&gt;so yeah, EVE actually shows capitalism(even outside of the fictional empires, if we look at players themselves), is very effective and pretty self sustaining.
---
The universe is currently locked in a state of endless, perpetual war, xenophobia, betrayal and violence, with compassion being seen as a weakness and the vast majority of wealth being held in the hands of a remarkably small number of individuals.
---
I'd hardly call that "effective," although "self-sustaining" might be true in a macabre sort of way.
---
&gt;is it destructive? everything is destructive in some way, the old and rusty must be torn down to make way for the new and vibrant. repeat this over and over. thats not dependent on a form of government at all, thats just human nature.
---
Justifications like this are often used to deflect responsibility, but I've never actually seen any evidence that they're true.
---
Why would I even buy fucking PLEX if I cancelled my subscription and don’t have to inject gunnery spec v for AT lmao 
---
Yeah, but one can't really grasp the scale of the entire real world. EVE Online is a microcosm so it's easier to get to grips with.
---
Well but again this is stuff thousands of Corps offer in hs aswell so why should i join you over those established groups? 
---
"Last time" meaning the last corp that I started. Lasted for a number of months and ended up with around 20-odd members, at least half were good, active players, by the time I disbanded it. Having no clear goals or objectives was my biggest mistake.
---
People like you seem really afraid of actually examining what games can say about real life for some reason.
---
I downvote anything with 'balance' in the title. 
---
Glad I did. 
---
I wish we could have seen those kill mail! In any case, it was a nice killing of gate campers! xD
---
you really took that socialist propoganda to heart.
---
might want to look up the definition of fascism, and stop using it as a trigger word...
---
and look up socialism while your at it.
---
like christ.....your labeling everything bad as fascist and everything you dislike as fascist.  
---
keep drinking hte kool-aid.  and go to venezuela while your at it.
---
or USSR...or china.....i'm sure you'll call all of them fascist cause bad.
---
I mean that your setup should looks(for viewers) like what you will take in 10 pilots fleet with some elementary restrictions. 
---
lets compare 2 setups:
---
AT15 setup
---
Harbinger Navy Issue 
---
Brutix Navy Issue 
---
Harbinger 
---
Brutix 
---
Punisher
---
and 
---
AT16 setup
---
Sacrilege 
---
Deimos 
---
Zealot 
---
Vedmak 
---
Thorax 
---
Thalia 
---
which setup is easier to understand for 1-2 min? I think first, because have only 5(!) different hulls - you need calculate in mind only 5 ships stats and multiply on 2. And second setup have 10 different hulls with different speed, dps, projection, tank, resistance profile and etc...
---
The only thing that truly makes any corp special is the people in it. So, I suppose, the only thing that makes my corp "special" in any way is me. Take from that what you will.
---
&gt;While Eve is a useful model for other things, it does not simulate a global economy very well because resources are literally infinite.
---
Resources may be infinite, but access to them is not. Moon mining only produces so many asteroids a time, and there aren't an infinite number of R64 moons. That's why people fight over them. It's accurate enough that reasonable comparisons can be made.
---
&gt;That, and it’s a good demonstration that when people have access to shared wealth that they will cheat and take more than they are owed from Corp hangers. 
---
Because there's literally no meaningful consequence to doing so. Law enforcement in EVE Online has always been extremely lax.
---
TIL, time to have another crack at it!
---
You realize though that all of this has been discussed on reddit for years. If they want to see what the player base thinks/wants they just have to come here or before the new forums were made, use their actual ones. You don’t need “consultants” you have over 100k of them here that say the same shit as the csm. 
---
you know the csm sign and NDA right?
---
you should probably take a minute to consider the average intelligence of facebook users
---
Ccp doesnt give a damn about the 100 spoiled entitled basement dweler acting like game developers with 50+ years experience posting and reading the shit show that is this place. Stop trying to think. You are not developers or CEOs of a company. CCP have 20 years experience managing and profiting from this game. They know better.
---
It's not my fault you didn't actually read any of the lore before trying to use it in an argument. And uh, none of the things you've said in this post actually, you know, contradict any of the points I made.
---
why do people sell stuff in jita that is way below the cost of materials? if I'm the manufacturer, I would just sell the minerals instead.no?
---
Thousands of corps, only one "me." That's not me being arrogant or snarky. I understand that I do nothing special and I don't advertise as such. Just looking for a good group of folks to hang and play with.
---
So, EVE Online is doing the nation a service!
---
They’re doing the voting cycle later in the war this year based on feedback from the current CSM.
---
good post
---
I'll just have to take your word for it, then.
---
First of all, r/eve is shit most of the time if not contradictory. Same goes with "what players want". The CSM is a way better way to get organized valuable input.
---
Like I care...
---
I'm having plenty of fun.
---
None of it requires or needs me to seek out PvP.
---
Let's ask this, are you high, low, bull, or wormhole?
---
Taking away the cheating and fixing of the tournament? 
---
But you fail to understand that you are a burger king in the fucking USA you are nothing special so why should someone join you? This is what makes your Job harder 
---
Every ship I have with a remote rep is always named in his honour.
---
Read the entire thread again and find out what specific things are being talked about before you're so wrong.
---
Nope there are no separate rooms for each time. Also those gilas ran around 800m-1.5b on zkill. 
---
I did eventually die later that week due to reaching a stalemate with a fella who did a dual active ancillary fit tank. Was sorta surprised he held cap
---
If you actually want to hold a meaningful conversation about this then you should make a separate post. The mega thread nature of this weekly thread is not condusive to actual discussion and tends to bury stuff, though it appears your post will end up getting buried anyways unless you can make a meaningful case for you position. 
---
Yea summit generally costs around 1500 usd all up for me. And aryth spends way more. 
---
Even considering your guys impecable regarding not leaking they, unfortunately, still partake in  the activities i described in the second part of my post.
---
For example: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/aqcufq/rip_alliance_tournament/egfrjyn/
---
So the easiest solution is to diaband it as op suggested. 
---
No they fucking don't, are you retarded? Have you been living under a rock since 2011? Your point is wrong to a degree that I have never ever seen before, and is unworthy of the paragraphs long blistering list of stupidity that I could type up to refute your own stupidity.
---
Brisc break your Lada?
---
&gt;unless you can make a meaningful case for you position
---
I mean, I already have. It's just that people get really, really whiny and upset when you criticise capitalism.
---
Again, important as in important for content creation. I dont think you understand what I mean or you're just ignoring what i'm saying. With the playerbase shrinking every day and the influx of new people as low as it is, I dont think major content creators can be replaced as easily as you think. Furthermore CCP is not exactly giving people ways to go out and create fulfilling content that isnt shooting rorqs or shittadels.
---
10% isn't worth opening the email for. It went straight to the recycle bin unopened.
---
All we need to forget about the at is for ccp to create some new cool skins. Or at leqst finish importing the ones from. China
---
It’s amazing how much bullshit you can fit into one statement. You should be in politics. 
---
There are hundreds of great ideas here. Some trash but most of the good ones are easily vetted. You also think the csm doesn’t have shit ideas? The csm is just not needed. It’s a waste of time and money. CCP knows what issues and changes people want. They don’t need the csm reiterating it. You can find reddit posts from plenty of past csm members where they say ccp doesn’t listen to them or care anyway. If they want to do something or have plans to do it, they’ll do it regardless. It’s all for show and a waste. 
---
he isnt wrong though 
---
Fuck you CCP and Pearl Abyss. All we see lately are skins and minor changes. Will you ever begin listening to your own community again?
---
All capital pilots would only pay for a day when needed.  Heavy industrialists would pay for a day and start 30+ day science and long build jobs then log out.  Cyno pilots would only plex as needed.  It would be very easy to abuse. 
---
Oh snap.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlOSdRMSG_k
---
Stop talking about how shitty the event is! There's no AT this year! Holy crap look at this whole 10% off of PLEX bundles! What's next?! Can't wait.
---
oh hurray, I get to support shit development for a generous $2 off.
---
pass.
---
I think it's important to remember that CCP just got paid a half billion dollars within the past 12 months.  
---
Lest we forget.
---
It’s a sandbox. If you don’t like the state of the game, do something to change it. It’s the players who created this, not CCP. CCP gives us the tools, we make the game. 
---
Don’t give them this much credit. They didn’t create the blue donut, or any of that stuff. We did. 
---
Goons can't handle facts, you lost this fight when you responded...
---
^^ this actually
---
thanks, I now did it easily with my destroyer using 6 random guns I had in my hangar.
---
I bet you $100 that a significant chunk of EVEs older playerbase has spent more time playing / using the game than most individual developers have. 
---
Yeah some stuff just isn’t profitable to make. Some stuff is only profitable in null or wormholes as well. 
---
Do keep in mind though there are some people like I’m Goons who are getting extremely cheap materials and exporting some of the finished stuff to Jita to sell. Jump freighters going back to high sec are often practically empty so anything to make their trip more worthwhile is good for them. 
---
You also unfortunately have a shocking number of people who subscribe to the “minerals I mine are free” line of thinking and will sell things at a loss compared to selling the ore straight up. 
---
Occasionally patches will make things unprofitable for a while too. For example I knew the changes to faction battleships were imminent. I built a few dozen and waited. That’s small time compared to what some people do and so when something is going to become obviously patched or changed people will often speculate and buy up massive hoards of that item and then sell it off after. It’s still profitable to them because they paid the old mineral price and get to sell through fast because nobody else can make new ones as cheap as they did. 
---
Also do make sure you’re calculating profitability with making all the sub components yourself (not reactions though), in a bonused structure with low system index to make sure if an item is actually profitable or not. 
---
Hold on, are you debating about economic policy in the lord in Eve online, and not the player economy? I can’t tell if you’re trying to RP or not. 
---
I wonder how hard it would be to code damage caps so that each application of damage is either fully deflected or not deflected at all. Then it could be set such that any hit with room below the damage cap gets applied fully, and we get the benefit of the damage cap (no insta-popping and a gentle encouragement against death-balling), while at the same time allowing attackers to gain a marginal advantage by applying extra resources. A dreadnaught or a titan with their individual guns volleying for significantly more could get significant rollover damage beyond the nominal cap.
---
If they bring back AT after this backlash it will draw attention away from all other ingame issues, please don't fall for CCPs shit... this might be a long con...
---
We should 51st state Iceland 
---
Actually it is a great idea that could be developed in something really cool:
---
\- Special event location with the Event Ore asteroids to mine. Ore belt sizes vary - Small, Medium, Huge, Enormous.
---
\- Ore can be mined only in a special event-ships with special mining equipment that allows to mine event-ore. Ships and equipment also vary from Venture class to Rorqual class ships with special drones.
---
\- This special belts are constantly attacked by NPCs. Wave strength varies based on a belt size.
---
\- Shooting NPCs gives event loyalty points.
---
\- Event LPs are the ONLY way to buy event ships+equipment!
---
\- Mined ore can be turned in for LPs, or refined to produce Boosters that boost mining/LPs gain.
---
Now the interesting part:
---
\- Shooting other players event ships also gives points!
---
Rewards can vary and there also could be both individual and corp/ally rewards.
---
Pros - fun for everyone, Miners mine, PVE shoot the NPCs to protect miners, gankers gank, PvP defend the big mining ops.
---
Cons - Large nullsec entities are going to have a huge advantage. This can be limited by event anomaly respawn rate, so that they can't sit in their home region forever and safely mine 24/7.
---
Yes. They dont have to give details. But it would be nice to know if they are addressing issues or just working on stupid shit like the Guardian Gala.
---
I want to give you good but i don't have any
---
I understand what you are saying. You also seem to think that by repeating yourself over and over my opinion that people viewing themselves as important in a video game is funny.
---
I imagine everyone that plays specifically for the AT probably gives at least a few fucks.
---
No, I understand very well that I'm a little fish in a big pond. I'm not looking to be the next CFC/Imperium.
---
Oh shit. You gonna get karma down voted for having an opinion that doesn't jive with the vocally outspoken.
---
You can't even give a one sentence pitch answer to a simple question. Maybe this is why no one wants to join?
---
right ok buddy lets just pretend that 90% of the launcher code isnt devoted to hosting advertisements and other useless bullshit that has nothing to do with actually launching the game and just keep pretending thats ok since its the only thing you can ever remember having 
---
Someone still salty about CSM Wormhole Destroyer Brisc Rubal.
---
Yeah the meme "Eve is dying" has come full circle to now be a real possibility.  It makes me question:  Is CCP doing this on purpose for some future new game or are they really just ignoring or killing the things that make Eve Online such a unique MMO?   I fear it's the latter.
---
better do a new kickstarter about it
---
Indeed, I've though of that. Always after the fact, though. Reached out to old corp members, but they've all moved on to other ventures. Best of luck to them, of course.
---
I'm going to upvote this to torpedo your attempt to get downvoted
---
Currently High/Low (pretty cookie cutter), with aspirations leaning toward Wormholes.
---
Yeah. I am allowed to go and gamble with my ships and time which has a real $ value but i can't bet further on the actual event with actual money? Really? 
---
Good write up as always stitch. Agree with a lot of the stuff and I’d be happy if even one of these things got implemented. 
---
I really, really, really hope that there’s serious balance in the works to justify no AT. Ccplz
---
Is this what White Knighting with spodbrain looks like?
---
They're developers, and they *used* to accept feedback. The battlecruisers of today was a suggestion i recommended years ago to them: [https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=420645&amp;find=unread](https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=420645&amp;find=unread)
---
They tweaked the role bonuses, but the general idea was the same. The Fleet hurricane also turned into what it is today thanks to "basement dwelling acting like game developers", like me. I wish i had a basement though, they're pretty cool.
---
That is just one example of many where they have accepted feedback from players. 
---
I even put spoilers on my opinions for balance, you're the idiot who opened the spoilers and then decided to complain about them. Go eat a big ol bag of juicy dicks. This is an open forum to talk about whatever the hell we want on this game.
---
Imagine having your dread bombs eat shit so often you want to blame Brisc Rubal for it.
---
I mean, both, actually. A huge number of the catastrophes in EVE Online's lore were caused by capitalism (because they are, in one way or another, based off of catastrophes in modern history, which were themselves mostly caused by capitalism).
---
*But also* a huge amount of stuff that has happened in the player-driven economy of EVE as a video game is eerily similar to economic issues that occur in real-world capitalism.
---
From what I can tell none of last years were posted
---
What part of him agreeing with the change is him keeping silent about it?
---
So, two sentences is the deal breaker? Rough.
---
Considering a good chunk of the CSM is within the same sphere of influence, I'm gonna say the CSM hasn't had any real meaning in years.
---
Why is it funny tho? An fc is important to the fleet because they cant do much without one, like a porpoise pilot is important to a mining fleet because of their boosts, and a content creator is important to eve because not much shit happens without them.
---
That's always one of the first things to get removed when companies want to save some $$. Marketing, and community outreach. They don't directly increase revenue. 
---
Marketing and community contact just cost money and don't see much increase in revenue.
---
holy fuck, youre stupid...
---
Are you retarded? Of course the csm will have talked to ccp about this. If ccp was smart enough to let the csm know before posting it i'm sure the csm told them exactly how buttemad people would be.
---
LOL
---
I raise you this:
---
Winners will get a bunch of lootboxes that they need to use PLEX on to get random shit that includes "AT-type" mining ships as well as regular garbage...
---
This Not the Deal as that is their way of attraction so to make youre recruitment easier you need to find a special Thing that makes you guys standing out like being able to mine next to Code without issues or stuff like that 
---
You mean, there are people with opinions different than yours? Shocking!
---
Fortunately, there were other voices in the room. Non-Inperium voices. Surely, as your elected officials, they spoke up.
---
That's more than doubling my red pen list fee, I'm not falling for your scam. And it's weird that I gave your brothers and sisters the sub sector I was mining in for an hour but they never showed up, go back to worshipping a false king.
---
surely it would be .44 with aryth
---
pffft... Player vs Plagioclase
---
Good thing said bounties are near useless in the area y'all control, more trouble in lowsec.
---
Oh, you mean 72000 MM!
---
The passionate outbursts at ever change should tell you all you need.   A game has to be something special for it to cause such a commotion. 
---
Not to mention that, Eve is not a game. It's a hobby. You invest time and money and lose real time and money when you fail.  
---
Eve is something that you join. Sure some people come by to see what its about. But the real content is very hard to understand in the beginning. 
---
calling it a vacation shows how out of touch you are
---
agreed with all of these.
---
CCP needs to focus its priorities...right now it feels like its following the approch of doing the BARE MINIMUM to have an excuse of saying "we're working"
---
and honestly, its hurting.  as a result each change they do backfires in someway.
---
They are as important as the guy that undocks and becomes content. They are as important as the guy on the gate camping it that can become content or kill someone who is content. they are all simply cogs in the machine. Remove the top 200 most active FCs in the game and within a few weeks, new FCs would pop up because they want to go do something and no one is holding their hand. I am laughing at the emphasis on the word important, like "special". You know who is important? Anyone that is socially active and becomes a part of a group, creating a structure that entices people to stick around to chat and have fun. If it's an FC? Cool. If it's Bob that keeps dying in his horribly fit Raven? Cool. Everything that undocks is content and everyone that goes to shoot someone else is a content creator if even just one person tags along.
---
Indy dude?
---
you realize NONE of the original CCP members are left at CCP? last one left in 2014.
---
so CCP might have 20 years experience, but the employees don't.
---
It was built for taxpayer money and construction started right before the 2007/8 financial crisis and it ended up costing close to 10x the amount initially projected.
---
The concert hall is a government owned company and it costs much more to run than projected and despite charging crippling amounts to host events, concerts etc it’s run at a big loss year round.
---
Then there’s the scandal in 2017 where Harpa’s CEO got a 20% pay rise and a month later, much of their service staff had their pay lowered by 20%.
---
This happened right after the govt decided wages at Harpa were no longer decided by the govt “wage comittee”.
---
Considering last year they all bitched and moaned about not getting super expensive shiny loot, I don't think it's all about the televised gudfites.
---
Here we are, wrecking people once again. 
---

---
Thank you for listening. It means a lot more than people will admit.
---
Do you know the government lied to you, and you live in a computer simulation?
---
I really want to keep playing this game, I don't want it to die just yet. 
---
 (67% upvoted) you may be onto something here.
---
I am not a big fan of the AT myself; I know some people are and I feel for them. 
---
It will be nice to have the more senior FCs around driving content instead of "practicing" for weeks on end just to get eliminated in the first 1-2 rounds. lolz
---
Considering that back when they killed the 2 jump bridges per system rule they also mentioned that "Titans were a mistake"
---
CCP seemed to always want a slower game while also doing things that would push people to fight for resources; But since the ability to respond to threats on the other side of your space has been severely gimped because "We don't want people's space to feel safe" it makes a question of 'Why defend our shit anyways' which pushes a lot of blueballing and low morale.  Add in citadel spam (24 hours to deploy, 3 weeks to destroy) and you have a lot of content that people just outright don't want to do.
---
fuck off then. 
---
I understand your point and it's a fair one, but which is more entertaining to watch? 8 battlecruisers and two frigates, or a full mixture of ship types with their own strengths and weaknesses?
---
I do think it's a challenge to make the AT accessible to watch, but forcing different ships does help stop BC spam and homogenous setups (eh: TEN THORAXES) but like you say it's also much easier to understand what's going on 
---
he's a goon that likes rorqs and caps
---
that should answer all of your questions
---
You still giving away stuff?
---
So much love 
---
"This EVE related promotion will only display once"
---
Damn, how times have changed.
---
You do realize that this is a video game right? That people play for fun? And will do irrational things in pursuit of entertainment? 
---
Also if you actually want to make a good argument then you should provide your own examples rather than expecting your audience to know what you’re referring to. If you want mores debating advice I’m going to have to start charging you. 
---
Did you just assume it's gender because it has a hole?
---
Totally get it, but we didn't have any isk. The new system stops completely broke newb corps from getting war decc'd which helps. 
---
Jup \^\^
---
Huh, what room?
---
I 'member
---
The awesomely semi rag-tag team of good christian men who struggled to get 10 people for their first practices and towards the end of our practices were taking a decent amount of matches with us, sometimes with our own comps.
---
Good times
---
you people complain so much about haw titans but let me tell you about LR titans at 250km
---
It really boils down to damage scaling IMHO, the jumps in damage and survivability are way to large from subcaps to caps.
---
If a single battleship were a real threat to a single carrier (assuming it could get it in gun range), and a Dreadnought was simply a superior battleship designed to fight other battleships at the expense of versatility and the ability to do the same damage to sub BS targets then you'd have a pretty clear role progression with counterplay up to Titans.
---
The room (metaphorical or otherwise) where the CSM does its thang.
---
Try to recruit for a non-english speaker corp, this is real challenge. Recruiter btw.
---
The whole thing just feels like a massive isk sink. At least gambling is FUN while you are spending money. I don't know what this is, but it isn't fun.
---
Now adays it's CCP shoving their iteron in our avatar
---
No wonder you're not recruiting anyone. Have you seen your recruitment post?
---
The biggest pitfall as a corporation you can have is to not have one single well defined goal or specialization. Look at the mess you call a recruitment post. So you do PvP, Lowsec Gang/Roams, Mine, Missions and Exploration. So basically everything but the kitchensink?
---
Any pilot worth his salt know that this sort of corporations are usually newbie traps. And you don't even list your corporation name.
---
If you want to PvP, just do that. Do nothing but that. Show you mean business by having a fat killboard on your belt. If you want to PvE, Wormholes or Nullsec is your only option.
---
Unless you carve in stone what your about, and build your corporation around that, you're stuck being mediocre.
---
In person makes it easier to keep an NDA properly, something tells me they won't stop that 
---
the feels
---
thanks so much, I even google it again
---
Dude, what a story. But I'm glad you could be with your family at such a time, that they got to see you do something you excel at, that your dad had an open mind and learned something. So many good moments mixed with the grief. Thank you. 
---
Hardly a punishment in such uncertain times
---
18k players 12 years ago. 19k players @03:00 Eve time everyday. This is very sad.
---
the best players in the game do.
---
I'm not too worried about Code, tbh. I've been laying the groundwork through fits and operating procedures to keep that threat to a minimum. I'm doing my homework, to the best of my ability, to provide a reasonably safe and efficient atmosphere once members start joining.
---
Bring back classical music EVE videos, down with wubstep
---
You do realize most AT participants are power users with typically have 5-10 accounts, super, titan, AT ship holders and if not an outright whale probably consumes enough plex off market to have an outsized weight on revenue?
---
sorry
---
good read, much feels. 
---
Damn, you're right, I DIDN'T list my corp name. Jesus Christ.
---
was 35k yesterday at 23:00 eve time.
---
should probably judge by time at end of EUTZ start of USTZ  when both TZs have players on.
---
Well, durin x47 we were constantly being disconnected, so i think that counts a some sort of cap. Although not predictable.
---
By Bob's beard, why did you put spoiler tags everywhere?
---
Yeah lmao sorry. Just started and it seemed like a  lot to me, turns out their are ships worth like 600 million+.
---
damn thas vintage shit right there. 
---
Bring more sand.
---
CCP I think you could have done better; 15-25% off plex packs and some sort of multi-training deal to tie in with the Valentines Day theme. 
---
This would made players extremely happy and you would have sold a boatload. 
---
same, and when they leave its all over. 
---
Me, personally? No. I mainly do Combat Exploration, occasionally run lvl 4s for shits and giggles, and pretend to be a good Solo PvPer.
---
Every once in a while I'll hop in a Mining Barge when I don't have the attention to devote to anything else.
---
or the 86400 seconds boosters lasts thats 24 hrs for the uninformed.
---
It's been dying since 2004
---
Should also be working to remove or nerf panic with rorquals. It doesn't make for engaging gameplay and runs counter to their entire purpose as 'content' generators when they're tackled. 
---
Actually this isn't quite correct. CCP's *investors* were paid afaik. CCP as the company received little/nothing.  
---
Is your mind important
---
WhyNotBoth.jpg
---
:) no collusion 
---
I doubt anyone cares enough to try and change your mind. If someone enjoys it let them be.
---
Because the topics he is talking about are way more important than his opinion on those topics. 
---
And so did many others before you and yet still they failed at the Same point
---
This is what im saying all the time you Lack the specials if you Look at the succsessfull Corps youll realize they all had and have still a unique point that sells to New guys and they cut their requirements for New recruits exactly to this thing May it be playstyle or a special community this is what you need to do and you will soon need a few recruiters more 
---
I'm not saying the goon csms are worse or better than the rest of the current csm but that the csm institutuion is wrong. 
---
People are not drawn to Eve because they saw an alliance tournament ad.  
---
&gt; but i can't bet further on the actual event with actual money?
---
Sure you can, you can't bet with in game currency by the EULA but you can do what the fuck you want with your "actual money" in the real world.
---
... ever. Ftfy
---
I feel like a lot of things have changed under the new parent company. Oddly enough these big companies are just as good at min/max'ing as eve players. Do we sink 10 million into CCP to get 15 out; or do we sink 10 million into ABC to get 100 million out... The beanheads choose ABC everytime.
---
If we think about the sheer amount of failed internal projects CCP has completed from a parent's perspective ... that shit will end up getting eve killed. Instead of making the game better, they're off going all in on VR/AR; which a large portion of the community doesn't want. 
---
How the fuck do you input broadcast in AR/VR over 15 clients... Eve has always been about multiple-accounts; which is why when CCP started doing this shit with AR/VR I totally saw the game dying a slow death.
---
That's only some of them. We played last year purely for the fun and competition. Shiny ships make for a nice dream but it wasn't likely we would make it that far. 
---
Plenty to consider, there.
---
Tell me about LR titans at 250km, I have no experience with this.
---
Recently dropped 100$ on plex. What should I spend the isk on to create a good constant isk source for my pvp activities? Only 6mil so here. 
---
Do your homework and take a specialication up and be good at it 
---
With an attitude like that I hope you don’t.
---
Some people like to compete when there's actually something to win.
---
Hate to break it to you bud but a lot of us are just leaving the game totally instead. AT always used to get me more hyped for eve, take out more fleets, do more things. With it gone I don't really feel like logging in at all now. 
---
just bought $500 worth thanks for the tip!!! this will let me inject a few new rorqs :) 
---
Wow
---
The best *PVPers* perhaps. Some of the the best *players* I know can't PVP for shit.
---
Good point. Somehow i forgot about rorqs.. oof. 
---
Remove panic or make it so cyno's/panic can't be used together would be a good start.
---
Yeah but who drinks Domestic?   ( ͝° ͜ʖ͡°)ᕤ 
---
TBH I personally don't really enjoy specializing. If I do something for too long, I get bored and have to move on to something else before cycling back. I do exploration and solo PvP the most, but get bored enough of them to spend some time mining and manufacturing ships for a short time before going back. I tend to let folks decide for themselves what they want to specialize in and have the support and services to aid them.
---
I suppose, if I'm being honest, I'm trying to be a High Sec version of Bovril, the Corp I was in in Null Sec.
---
You are not Eve material. Change my mind.
---
I think this would benefit Eve far more than the AT Ever could have.
---
I've been there man. I've always joked to myself that I'd end up finding my "eve retirement home" corp since I've been playing this shit for 11 years now, and after about a two years with my current corp I've finally found it... It's a good feeling
---
No drones in wetus is my pick for nerf the krabs might not riot about. Make it so losing one matters and the hunters can actually make isk.
---
I have eight holes. What does that make me? 
---
I mean you could have just checked Zkill top alliances by kills this month.  
---
PL and NC are above Snuff.... Init...  
---
Sort of seems like you did no research on this and just wrote a bait post on reddit =\\
---
I'm glad there are others out there that can see sense! I really hope that a lot more ships receive the awesome module which is the PANIC module. this module is fair and balanced.
---
Correct. I understand some people don't care about my opinion on balance. Thats fine, its more just about the main topics that need addressing.
---
If they want to know my opinion, they can open the spoiler. But they also then lose their right to complain about a balance post if they open the spoilers.
---
Not sure why everyone on this sub gets off on believing they've been playing longer than everyone else on the sub.
---
Certainly haven't been here the longest, but I'm pre-RMR Ex(2005).  I'm not sure why being familiar with classic login screens means I have to fury-masturbate hate on the launcher.  I can certainly see why you'd have a distaste for it, but I don't share that sentimentality.  I know I'm out of place for this sub, by not claiming to hate everything about a game I can't stop playing and all, but hey.  I don't doubt you would rather have a straight login screen.  And you don't have to recognize that people - older, newer, or better players than you - can have a different opinion.  We'll keep doing what we do.
---
That's why it's optimal to just eat smoked salmon from the grocery store the entire trip.
---
But then he will have everyone's stuff. 
---
But you Lack brovils selling points of theta and rorq Mining so youre fucked
---
Without a clear direction your path is Set to the dumpster of failed and disbanded eve Corps
---
then vote for people you like you nonce

Haha yeah. Posted it to my corp with my Username on an everything. Mistaaake.   
---
Lessons learned. 
---
Not to mention If you’re doing it right, AT keeps many of these people and their many accounts busy and engaged with the game for several months. Not just one. 
---
They used to be the most powerful. Now they're not. It's only natural the talk would shift a bit to focus on the ones that took their place.
---
Einstock is great.
---
Yeah, I don't believe I'm fucked, but perhaps that's just me staying optimistic. 
---
In any case, I appreciate all the feedback. You've given me lots to consider for improving my Corp and my recruitment. Sincerely appreciate that.
---
you're discounting the fact that 30k of those players are rorq alts and bots
---
^/s^?
---
&lt;shaking my head&gt;
---
10%? What a joke
---
&gt;They also don't have built in webs/points that sacrifice nothing while they retain the lock speed of a frigate thanks to the NSA.  
---
Nice exaggeration there.
---
Swiss cheese?
---
Holey
---
That’s exactly what I decided to do this morning. The absence of a long term roadmap, the slow death of my favourite playstyle (lowsec piracy) and now the cancellation of the AT...I have been subbing two accounts since 2012 but I have yet to be convinced that Pearl deserves any of my real life money.
---
So I’ll let my 6-month subscriptions lapse, then burn through my assets to buy plex. These should last me for another 12 month, long enough to see where things are going.
---
&lt;shrugs&gt;
---
Hey bud, here's that attention you were craving for being part of a mass of drooling retards. Grats!
---
Those engines are 100% full power bois. He's going in hard!
---
&gt; They also don't have built in webs/points that sacrifice nothing 
---
While i agree with much of what you've written this statement is just completely horseshit and you know it. A 33% damage decrease is the price you pay for having a set of support fighters on a regular carrier and if you want both point and web then you're sacrificing 66% of your potential damage. (approximately \~20-40% for supers) I'm all up for a rational and honest debate, but don't start claiming shit that simply isn't true.
---
Eve is what you make of it, and finding like minded people to fly with.  I've never known such a socially active community but sadly this sub is often the negative face.  Play for free and make up your own mind, ignore the opinions here until then.
---
I think Eve without the AT is in a much better place. Now our members can focus on ADM's and providing industry to PVP Adverse coalitions so that the leaders of these coalitions can RMT without interruption 
---
funny that you won AT and we won sov
---
Uhm, most alliances cant field 250 people for a strat op, let alone a fun brawl...
---
imagine taking yourself so important that you:

There is a massive difference in quality of a meeting when online or face-to-face. Video Conferencing works great but the meetings dont stop, they continue through out the whole week of being in iceland an d often discussions continue in the pub, at dinner etc. 
---
Also the trips are not completely all inclusive. They cover a large part of it but the summit still cost me like 400/500 euro's (I'm a student so I was still carefull with my money). They definitly make life great but I still had to save up money to go the the summits :)
---

---
Remember kids, risk it all on grabbing as much as you can at the Duty Free.
---
You don’t have to be omega to extract tho ?
---
whats the point of this thread?
---
I actually wonder how much the CSM knew about this... Or that its now topic number one at the summit... 
---
first off, check recent lore regarding caldari prime.  they nto still fighting over that planet. that ended when the titan fell and Mordu's legion got put in charge of security.
---
2nd, look at descriptions of the races.  Caldari is not in debt to the Amarr.
---
and wtf.   
---
&gt;technologically superior Gallente Federation
---
da fk?! have you read ANY lore description.  the reason the Caldari are respected by other empires they are few in number vs the other races but more advanced.   
---
thats also why they are able to hold against Gallente.   read some lore ffs.
---
hell. go read the lore survival guide, or hell the default description on the character creation screen.
---
and you say i didn't read lore. i at least read all the old wiki (rip) and the entire lore survival guide, plus all the books including the art work.
---
and have listened to each of the EVE reader podcasts.
---
and Caldari were slumping economically even before the war, due to alot of CEOs trying to appease gallente (its in the book).   Tibus Heth's rise to power actually reinivigorated the economy and gave it an economic boom.
---
while this economic surge did die out after a while when the war became a stalemate and went into a recession for a time following the loss of Caldari prime and the restructure of the government soon after.   it once more stabilized and the Caldari are (at present) experiencing economic growth.
---
their alliance to the Amarr is not one of debt like you imply with "subsequently putting themselves tens of trillions of ISK".
---
heck, as implied from Templar one, there's actually very little in the way of alliance there outside of one of mutual defense.
---
so again, go read the lore.
---
does this mean i can grab the drone land renter empire soon? i should have more firepower in my veins than all local renters combined.
---
Tell me again what other ship gets hi slot tank mods, damage mods and 500% SEBO, while also having point/web drones and still filling its mids with max tank (shield ships) and application, while filling the lows with nothing but damage mods?
---
You're right, I forgot about the non-consensual pvp clause.  That could work.  I did like that all assets in the AT were actually destroyed though.  You'll lose that on the test server, and getting the officer/faction gear is difficult on the test server since it's not stocked.  Has that changed?  It's been years since I logged in there.
---
Are you denying that the GSM doesn't have a higher than average smug factor per member?
---
Woah woah whats this talk about cancelling the AT tournament?

so that i could upvote your comment so you could get more than 150 karma

Imagine having a hate boner so much you need to use bullet points. Grr hate 
---
Good golly
---
A lot of this depends on where you live, what your current skills enable you to do, and what you want to do.
---
Carriers and rorquals might be accessible for you, and while they aren’t the best income sources nor the most enjoyable, but if you want to fly caps it’s a good place to start. If you want more passive IsK sources, getting Blueprint set and industry and science skills can work out. PI can also be good if you have good access to planets. You could probably do these in parallel with other IsK generation sources. 
---
No matter what you do, I would definitely recommend you make an alt account. There are next to no IsK generation methods that don’t benefit immensely by having an extra account. 
---
2018 saw the first ever non-korean world champion in starcraft. "Serral" is from Finland and I was live watching it like every year. Other people see the Super Bowl, and I see the StarCraft championship every year.
---
&gt; That’s exactly what I decided to do this morning.
---
So you decided on not supporting CCP anymore today, is that what you mean?
---
&gt; So I’ll let my 6-month subscriptions lapse
---
So no more giving them money starting today then I assume.
---
&gt; then burn through my assets to buy plex. These should last me for another 12 month, long enough to see where things are going.
---
So after those six months that you have already paid for, you're going to give them even more money for a subscription buy using the PLEX market? I thought you were going to stop paying today.
---
Eve is dying the same as you are. time.you spend in one place or another. Do it if you enjoy it. If not dont. Eve has been dying since launch. Same as you since launch (birth)
---
Everything that loves dies. Get over it. Or dont but it'll happen. These threads are daily.
---
hm, ccp makes more money from plex than subs. so if you normally plex it, you can stick it to them by subscribing!
---
Hey you forgot what it did for some groups, that totally accidentally had the right idea to change their meta to a patch that was published nearly half a year later ...
---
damnit i just got back into eve. would suck if it dies before i'm ready to do cool shit like null.

I'm sorry that we're better at tard wrangling than you. Power's power, m8.

atm you get organized valuable input that leads to making mining a hello kitty game and PvP below Capitals nearly pointless ...

you got 500 million dollars?
---
That's insanely abusable.  I think any war dec corp would love that change, as it provides a way to bait less informed players (or informed idiots) into joining a war that has no defined end point.
---
A post that involves greater balance changes AND some FW love? All my yes.
---
Who do you think will read this, exactly?
---
You just listed off the same thing everyone else claims. Nothing about your corp sets it apart from anything else. If you can't even do that, why would anyone bother.
---
I support this message, little dino and monkey friends.
---
Back when Eve was still subscription based, standings were important to anchor pos-towers in highsec, get a cut in marketing cost and to have clones in stations of specific factions. During that era there were pilots actually offering standing fixes, either private or corporate, which would grind you or your corp to have a specific standings profile, depending on your demands.
---
With the citaspam (which in my opinion isn't that bad by itself), standing has become almost completely irrelevant. Your cost cut when setting up market orders is negated by moving to a player owned 0.1% market hub. It doesn't matter if you're barred from having clones in a certain NPC station, because just around the planet there's a Raitaru offering a free clone bay. And it doesn't matter who puts up the stations. I'm pretty sure a Caldari Militia corp could anchor a Fortizar in Gallente highsec without interference, just to give the most extreme example.
---
In my opinion anchoring a structure in highsec should require standings again, going up in standings demand with higher security.
---
&gt; Imagine having a hate boner so much you need to use bullet points. Grr hate
---
imagine taking yourself so important that  .... lul
---
&gt; Everything that loves dies.
---
What if I don't love? Am I immortal?
---
you can now buy deadspace mods on the test server, but not officer mods.  Since all these guys have officer mods on the live server already, getting them mirrored shouldn't be a huge task.
---
In my mind, all the loot used on the test server tournament would have to be entered into escrow on the live server, so when your flagship dies in the tournament, the third-party deletes it on the live server.  You probably won't be able to have looting the field be an option, but you could still have the participants putting their isk on the line for reals.
---
It costs £100 to fly me to Iceland and £400 for the room.
---
I spend on average £400 on food each summit, before alcohol.
---
I should have specified and said "fitting" sacrifices.
---
That being said, using a niddy as an example. It does \~2900 dps with T2 mods. A 66% reduction in damage is still 986dps. You're doing battleship sized damage, with the application of a light missile with only 1 fighter squadron, while having a mobile point/web and allowing full application/tank on your capital ship. There are no fitting sacrifices being made, or hard fitting decisions. It always the same max tank/application fits.
---
You can kill a lot of subcaps with 986dps.
---
If the NSA were removed and base sig res buffed on carriers so they had to use mids for points/webs, then that would actually take fitting into consideration and help. So if they want to lock like a frigate, they'll need some mid SEBO's or sig amps. Not a high slot module that sacrifices nothing in terms of fitting and utility.

And yet you keep replying. Laughing under loud?

Basically business logic.  Poor numbers in terms of player retention from missions, with small section of players actually doing them, and the expense of re-writing the scripts and paying voice actors.  I mention re-writing because most of the missions would end up as awful monologues if voice acted in their current forms.  I'd rather have a few cutscenes added to the epic arcs, and a little better direction to the pirate faction and empire arcs.  Some additional pirate arcs would also be cool, or perhaps an epic arc that involves wormhole space?

I was in a larger alliance for a while. Fun people. The problem is that most of those huge corps love large fleet pvp. Which is something I can stand. It’s basically a game of chess between the two FCs. Fun for some people. But I prefer small 4-5 man bullshiting fleets where you just do your thing

How expensive is the Alliance Tournament to produce?  I would donate to fund it.... I thought I was doing that by buying all these subscriptions and plex but whatever. I'm still talking about the cool fights in the last Alliance Tournamnet. 
---
The capital changes I read here will just make Eve go from "The one who has the biggest supercap fleet win the fight" to "The one who has the biggest supcap blob win the fight".
---
I leave to your imagination how a smaller entity can defend against a bigger one if their super umbrella does nothing to stop an invasion.
---
Also, can people stop asking for Capital rebalance because a small gang cannot do anything against a capital force thrown at them ? It's not like one carrier will kill your small nano shit gang and ruin your fun. Same for your cynos proposal.
---
You're either a lowsec or a wormhole pilot, are ye ?
---
As for Battleship, I agree that Navy price against Pirate are bad, seeing the navy are way less effective than their pirate counterpart.
---
But nerfing the droprate is retarded at most, rebalancing navy ships is a fine idea, and I think you don't understand how farmable Mordu's ships are. Nobody cares as they aren't fit for line member usage, else the prices would be the same as the current NS faction BS.
---
And please don't get me started about the " If they want to know my opinion, they can open the spoiler. But they also then lose their right to complain about a balance post if they open the spoilers. ". You are putting thing on a forum, they get debated, end of story.
---
They could release the most comprehensive balance patch tomorrow and it would make no real difference. The problem is how incredibly reluctant they are to fix issues as they arise. We shouldnt have to bitch for years to have a playable game. It should be in their fucking interest to keep track of what is needed.
---
Do you think they just put themselves on a timer or jinxed themselves? 10 years and 5 days, dudes ;D

So, for those following along at home, the gameplay trailer they released a little while back showed a Republic Fleet task force of Tempests blowing up a citadel. Coincidentally, the AI testing disguised as an in-game event in Semiki suddenly has.... Republic Fleet Drifters?

The safety setting already exists. So your fear is a non-issue.

No, instead of buying another sub with dollar he's going to hoover up plex which is already on the market. Sure he's adding to the demand of plex but I'd say that's a lot different from actually buying a sub or plex with his own dollar.

---
since an EVE month is always 30 days you end up 5 days short of a year, hence it counting down from the 9y 12mo 5d mark
---
Thanks for the correction, as I said before I agree with much of what you've said but I think if our aim is to actually find a fair balance it's important to rule out misconceptions and misleading statements.
---
That said, just shy of 1000 dps isn't exactly a fuck ton, I think your right on the money to say that the real issue is not the dps but application and the lack of compromises that have to be made to get incredible lock speeds etc
---
Keep fighting the good fight. Love your Youtube video's btw dude.
---
CCPLZ ... oh wait.
---
Don't forget that their 'balance changes' only pushed half the ships that already weren't great completely out of the meta since in small scale you simply can't undock without multiple jaguar counters.
---
You were forced to stay docked for a month?... really?
---
Nope we just have 2 braincells together and know that there will be PLEX sales with conditions like the galaxy packs last year. CCP is forcing themselves to do this with their current policies. Otherwise PLEX-Sub will hit 2 Bil very soon and maybe 2.5 Bil over 2019. Paired with the Ore inflation and thus sinking Rorqual ticks your mining pubbies will cry "CCPls why my sub so expansive" as they already started here ...

&gt; assume the reason their holding back on telling us all that is to come is because EvEsterdam (and thus their keynote) is coming up soon. They want to have something to surprise us with.

Well duh, but each "update" comes with a promise that they're going to *discuss* discussing updates in the next update. They didn't say "we have exciting updates but just wait til X event! We'll explain all the things!"
---
I do. The AT is puts the spotlight on high skill small gang pvp, and ccp getting rid of it seems like a shift to where eve had been going to, massive null blocks cap blobbing everyone until the servers break. I love small gang/roaming, and i don’t like the hour long titan blob tidi fests.

PLEX on the market is also money that has already been spent by a customer. Depending on the age of the PLEX it could also be money long spent by CCP.

That’s always been the case though. (Posting with an alt obviously).

This subreddit is maddening. One day you have people upvoting comments like this. The next day you have people upvoting unironic "you just want to kill a carrier with your frigate" type comments.

We asked for this meta. We, the players, actively resist changing things that matter, like Rorquals and caps. Then we turn around and smash that upvote button on these CCPlease balance posts. We did - and are currently still doing - this to ourselves.

Supers have been nerfed more than anything in the last years. Drones/drone bay, EHP, scan res, skynetting..etc. Everyone started to freak out with the EHP loss, but then they just got required to have a fax alt, which you didn't address. Or I didnt bother to read, fucking spoiler whiny shit.

that'd involve a lie and that isn't fucking christian

&gt; Studio rentals aren’t exactly confidential information.
---
In Iceland, they might as well be, for what anyone outside Reykjavik will be able to find out. Renting the production equipment isn't cheap, I've been on both sides of that bill. Staffing the production and catering is sometimes horrendously expensive. 
---
Flying 10 people to Reykjavik and putting them in a hotel for a week or two isn't exactly cheap. 
---
Losing a few hundred subs (probably just for a few weeks) is chump change.

It might actually affect the game a little bit, but people will move on and deal with it.

---
Because you don't have the people you have to give people direction to do in the game. This "laid back environment where you decide how to play the game" doesn't really help because you are trying to get the newer people to join and most newer people don't really know what they want to do. You have to focus your corp into something at first then when it's doing that thing well you can branch off into more things.
---
You can still fit an armor carrier with max application mids and full damage hi-slots or drone nav's while retaining a huge tank. Hell, most Thanny's are shield fit for this exact reason, so technically you have dedicated armor carrier. 
---
There are not fitting sacrifices being made on a carrier. You just fit NSA, have your point or web drone and then fill the rest of your slots with tank/application/damage. Its so dumbed down for you smoothbrains.
---
Yet, even if you remove 2 of your fighter squadrons for siren/dromi, you're still doing 986dps with a niddy. So battleship's worth of dps with the application of a light missile (fury) that can point/web out to thousands of kilometers and go 14k/s.
---
Please. Battleships get nerfed more than any other ship in the game and its normally done through indirect nerfs, like making capitals retarded and AF getting an invuln button that means battleships can't touch them before they get blobbed. Cry me a river about your shitty supers abusing broken mechanics like skynetting and absurd EHP or infinite drone bays.

problem is, hour long tidi fests make ccp more money and they can post sped up footage without mentioning mass DCs to bring in yet more money
---
This deserves far more upvotes 
---
In all honesty and seriousness (yea serious biznezz mode now ok?), to my understanding their role is to bring issues to CCPs attention, and maybe convey some feedback from players to CCP and vice versa. The problem is that all of the current ones, except Suitonia, seem to be very skewed. And they are not representative of Eve Online across the board. I do believe this had a large role in at least some of the design decisions, such as the ECM and interceptor changes, both of which are a very blatant duo of changes that largely benefit krabs, multiboxers and bots (more Rorqs anyone ?).
---
2nd problem is that CCP is actually stupid enough to believe in things which are pushed to them to further the agenda of only some player segments at the cost of others.

I'm genuinely curious now: who touched you, and where?
---
If CCP doesn't want to spend a penny on tournaments I won't spend a penny on their game. That includes lapsing SP farm driven accounts. But even if they reversed course on the AT it would be really hard to have much trust in them to fix the rest of the game at this point.
---
Hahaha, I remember this. That was in the middle of the BoB - Goonswarm war. I was in a BoB client alliance Firmius Ixion, which rented Querious from BoB. Good times.
---
I miss that era of EVE. Tried to get back into it but it's just not the same.
---
remove wormholes to save like half the dollars
---
perennialism is an interesting idea of pedagogical philosophy that hinges on the notion that something which lasts an indefinitely long time, recurs again and again, or is self-renewing. in this manner, we might study the works of Plato or Aristotle because they are timeless and of interest to people in all ages. Just as there will always be shadows on the cave wall; Saeka will always be a frothing retard. 
---
The massive jump in health between Battleships and caps is the largest one between classes. If the cost:EHP scaling worked like subcap scaling, caps and dreads would have somewhat more than half a million EHP depending on hull and fit.
---
u big homosexual
---
Its almost like there are various groups within the r/eve hivemind that don't agree with each other.
---
The AT being cancelled was just a catalyst for the group that favors the meta change to be more outspoken. For at least the past 3 years, most of us have been campaigning against capitals and for more balance, but are met with spodbrain/smoothbrain response like the ones you mentioned and they can be larger in numbers depending on timezone. Hence the flip/flop of reddit.
---
no point sugarcoating it, if you're shit you're shit and hs mining corps are shit
---
But still on the subreddit 
---
We wander through combat anoms/sigs in Gallente HS down by Genesis, ignoring the world while we drink and talk about whatever in corp chat and shout random nonsense to neuts who show up in local. If this sounds like fun why not join us, if not well whatever.
---
- I just explained the goals of a fictional corp better than your ad does for a real corp.
---
it's pretty fun to call shit alliances shit, especially when they whine about it
---
lol *I'm* whining? That's precious.
---
To each their own m8
---
Ok, what about CSM from the United States or Australia? 
---
What do you do that you don't see any problems with Eve unless this is sarcasm
---
&gt; You really do seem to have a major dick up your ass about APOC. It seems like every other time I post something you're there to take some cheap shot at us.
---
sounds like the usual provi whining to me tbh
---
Ya know, that's pretty good. I'm not even mad.
---
Where do I apply?
---
CCP made ccpls "when memes become reality" because they don't want us to realize the other eve meme (eve is dying) is becoming reality too!
---
&gt;There are not fitting sacrifices being made on a carrier  
---
Umm, thats why they lowered EHP. 
---
&gt;Yet, even if you remove 2 of your fighter squadrons for siren/dromi, you're still doing 986dps  
---
My Stratios used to do 900 DPS, thats not very much.  
---
Also, Im not quite the one crying here, you created a whole post about it. lol, shitty supers abusing mechanics....  Wait, nevermind...you should be the hero that comes up with the winning ideas to balance this game. You'll be the savior to all nano nerds.
---
yes there is they enabled shooting in ns smh my head my rorq fleet can't go out now
---
Jita 4-4 Undock with 500 PLEX and 6 LSI in the hold of a Velator 😂
---
Say no more!
---
A balance patch solves nothing whatsoever. It only provides a temporary alleviation of inconveniences largely only felt by nullsec fleet players.
---
The problem is systemic in the game itself. It used to be a true sandbox, right now it looks more like a glorified but rigid version of Risk. Untill the true sandbox returns nothing will help this game.
---
&gt; and then the highseccers can scream as their mining takes 10x as long! 
---
so how about we shoot the hisec orcas in the first place
---
Is that 42 thousand or 42? 
---
next we will see CCP spamming jita local with firesales.
---
It's Einstök, like in Börk Börk 
---
Just pointing out the obvious, mate. It's clear you're sitting on a mountain of salt generated by Provi.
---
No, the cheapest food I've found is a hotdog which costs 500 ISK, which is \~$4.5. Scale that up, plus add that you literally have to eat at restaurants and you'll understand why we bitch about it. 
---
Now THIS is spodracing!
---
because horde wears the pants now
---
well it is true i've built a mountain of salt with donations from you guys
---
Having something to look foward to for years is a positive in my mind. Just not in the way its implemented.
---
Right now , it's I can do this in 6 months, cool let me log out and log back in 6 months later.
---
There's no reason to play those six months, theres nothing to work towards in game except grind some isk, so if you log in set your que, buy a plex, then really there's nothing left to do until your skills are ready.
---
More like an avatar in our avatar 
---
we don't ecm here tyvm you need to use damps like a true fucking christian
---
You're adorable.
---
they still ... look they offer 10% plex

tldr past first sentence

Got bored&gt; Left Legacy&gt; Joined really active wormhole group&gt; Feels like whole new game and having more fun then ever. I think burned out players should give Wspace a shot.
---
i should really do that lol
---
Today I havent seen a single Gala site in the 3 constellation I fly around to do my biddings(NS).
---
But seriously, just figure out what the focus is gonna be, don't need to stick to it entirely just need to be able to explain like 2-3 things that are gonna be the main day to day activities.
---
Painting is the superior EWAR
---
yeah i suspect there are at least three real people but the rest of us are alts
---
I'm with ya mate, Serral is a fkin beast &lt;3 
---
Someone paid for that PLEX, so the question you should be asking is: does buying PLEX in game affect whether someone buys PLEX with real money? If so, buying PLEX in game is propagating the issue and not actually denying CCP money.
---
eh, could do that but that isn't really out of the ordinary or an annoyance to ccp.
---
making servers have tidi annoys ccp.
---
The difference is you can fight a subcap blob with bombs, booshers, ewar, neuts, kiting, splitting them with bubbles, headshotting their anchors or bringing a direct counter to their comp. You can't fight a capital blob without a bigger capital blob because they're practically IMMUNE to everything. There's zero counterplay beyond numbers and it's fucking disgraceful that we've traded this piss poor PVP environment for what we had before with subcaps. 
---
um excuse me but range damps are the true ecm, smh my head disgusting heretic
---
I deeply enjoyed the last two events. I had one alt mining in orca, I made friends in this event, I had another one hunting the BS, it was fun, I did with several ships (no gila, no T3, no marauder because those were not fun) and with friends, we made close to 1B/h in the first days (after tax, direct sell order).
---
You'll always be my favorite Thalia pilot tho
---
you kill the orcas, they head to forums to whine, nothing happens, they unsub/stop using plex, (lol implying hisec miners make enough to plex) ccp accountants on suicide watch
---
Go and read the minutes ...
---
look man all i know is i went on here and CCPls'd about the clock so... now i gotta CCThx for its *timely* return. huehue
---
I swear to god gatecampers are the lowest iq people in EVE. 
---
Interesting fit, good fight
---
let me put it this way, if my objective is to pass a test and I study very hard but end up with the same grade as someone who didn't study anything I still didn't accomplish shit. 
---
Replace "pass a test" with make the game better and "study very hard" with give very thorough and effective guidance and the you go. I don't know if the csm were the best consultants ever, the worst or anything in between, when people talk of the csm they take the goal to be the betterment of the game and not the quality of the consultation. If they are excellent consultants and ccp decides to ignore all they say they still didn't accomplish shit.
---
What I'm trying to convey is that the AT increased in quality *without* having time earmarked off for improvements.  The success was a blessing and a curse in that regard, because the mentality was likely "well we don't have to devote more proper resources to it, there's so much buy in that it'll come naturally!"
---
Bold words for someone within target painting and crusading range
---
oh bugger
---
I've calculated the injectors costs unfortuatnely 100$ wont skill me into a carrier. Pi and industry are my main goals right now. Im just interested in other ventures
---
Never paid them, never got targetted by them. Still brick tanked my barges and kept disposability in mind. Don't pay up, don't talk to them, or give them anything else they'd just come back if you do.
---
Sounds like CCP needs some Texas Lawyers!
---
I think you're right on many parts.  I'd also like to add in that for a successful tournament, there has to be a way for the viewers to interact/participate/feel ownership with the teams.  When Eve-Bet was a thing, people cared more about who won/lost and were invested in the teams.  After that, the investment became who they fly with.  When the finals come down to two training partners that are both quite small on TQ, there's very little investment there.  
---
If there's a fantasy aspect to it, where viewers can have some form of agency over the teams, then it will be more exciting to watch.
---
What’s your plan when your FC and command team now decides to quit playing altogether? 
---
i forgot the /s
---
I haven't played Eve in a few years, but at [Eve Offline](https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility) isn't the game population right around the historical average right now? 
---
My email sends all the stuff regarding Eve from CCP to spam for some reason. I've never changed it.
---
Sounds like you try to provide everything but you can´t provide anything.
---
How about silently unsubbing instead?
---
The difference is between "CCP killed the AT because it didn't understand the value of it" and "AT is gone this year because they didn't have the resources to put it on in an acceptable way."
---
Obviously I'm bummed that it's not on, and peeved that the community team doesn't have the resources to put on an amazing AT, but to say that CCP killed the AT because they don't care - or think that in delivering something that it's not meant to deliver on - is wrong. 
---
bruh I've been to two fanfests, yes it's pricey, but if you're dropping 100£ a day on food alone you're bonkers. 
---
EVE Auto Chess, coming soon 
---
&gt;first off, check recent lore regarding caldari prime. they nto still fighting over that planet. that ended when the titan fell and Mordu's legion got put in charge of security.
---
I mean, it's still a flashpoint for political conflict between the two factions and the larger factional war between the Gallente and the Caldari continues, but go off.
---
&gt;Caldari is not in debt to the Amarr.
---
[Oops](https://www.eveonline.com/article/amarr-empress-announces-massive-investment-package-for-caldari-state-2).
---
&gt;da fk?! have you read ANY lore description. the reason the Caldari are respected by other empires they are few in number vs the other races but more advanced.
---
If you actually examine the context from which you've extracted that sentence, you'd see it was in relation to the technological gulf between the Gallente and the Amarr, not between the Gallente and the Caldari, but go off.
---
&gt;and you say i didn't read lore.
---
Because you clearly didn't.
---
"Drifters can now hack into CONCORD's standardised ship identifications why they would use tampered corp designations is still unclear"
---
That's the best explaination I could come up with.
---
I kind of get you, the little bit I did missions the flavor text could be fun. I always felt bad with the taunting or pleading in local because I rarely look at the local window wormholer btw. Even if there was something like radio static to remind you to look there would be something.
---
Thanks!
---
&gt;You do realize that this is a video game right?
---
A video game that is a simulation of libertarian capitalism.
---
Nice vid!
---
Realistically Frigates are corvettes, Destroyers are Destroyer Escorts, Cruisers are frigates, Battlecruisers are Destroyers and Battleships are Cruisers in terms of significance, roles and relative expense.
---
Unfortunately at this point it would be easier to rename everything then to rescale and balance battleships to be actual Capital Ships.
---
I'm really happy to hear that you enjoy the AT broadcast and that it made a little social circle in your group.  The Brave AT team was one of my favorite storylines to follow
---
Stop subscribing and stop buying *and* using plex.
---
If enough people do this it will cause a huge price drop in plex, making external rmt a better option for the whales that remain to get isk, which in turn means even money to ccp and more trouble with bot accounts.
---
CCP can either act on this by increasing monetization (certain death), not acting at all (certain death) or try and fix things up in the game and with the community (sliver of hope).
---
back when eve was fun
---
Businesses need to diversify. Right now, all of CCP's eggs are in the eve basket, and that's a bad place for a business to be. No product lasts forever, and when eve finally does die (whether tomorrow or in 10 years), they need something they can make money on.
---
Now, it's fair that their attempts at it haven't been great, but if they do nothing, CCP as a company is not long for this world.
---
uh....you realize thats Amarr investing in Caldari. 
---
&gt;Empress Jamyl I revealed plans today for an unprecedented investment in the Caldari State by the Amarr Empire, promising trillions of ISK from the Imperial treasury, Amarr royal families, and other financial institutions.
---
not Caldari getting a loan. or going bankrupt
---
its like when you invest in stock market. helps them short term, with you hoping to get long term gains by long investment through its growth.
---
and check the Gallente Caldari war again, theres a reason Caldari survived and matched Gallente despite being insanely outnumbered.  its flat out stated.
---
So... Eve is dying right? 
---
Where are all the PLEX sales and Skins ads???
---
(effort posting in a thread basically nobody will read but what the hell?)
---
If you think the key things the CSM does are in the minutes, you don't know how the CSM works. It is both unfair and a little bit sad that the only people who know how important the CSM actually is are the ones who have been on the CSM during the right years and the people who trust the CSM candidates enough to believe how much it matters.
---
But to use an example, the year that nullsec gave up on the CSM was the year that CCP removed two jumpbridges per system and instituted the biggest anomaly nerf in Eve history. This wasn't a coincidence. Regardless of your opinion of the changes themselves, it's an excellent example of why the CSM matters and why you should care who is on there.
---
* Vote for CSM. Vote for someone who represents your interests. Sometimes this doesn't even have to be a friendly. A nullsec leadership candidate will have a similar perspective regardless of who they're blue to. This is the same for wormholers, lowsec pvpers, highsec, etc. Though just because a candidate may come from one area, doesn't necessarily mean they only know or care about that area.
---
* Don't vote for the person who just wants a "free" "vacation". (And don't run if you're expecting this.) Even though the trips are neither, it's still annoying how many people run thinking it is just that. It's essentially an unpaid business trip. Except my actual business trips are more fun and I get paid to be there.
---
* Don't vote for the meme candidate. 
---
* Don't vote for the single-issue candidate. The CSM has no power to tell CCP what to do. If CCP decides to work on the issue great, if not, you're not likely to change their minds. I've seen multiple single-issue candidates fry out of frustration when the only thing they cared about never came up as actionable.
---
* The best candidates have always been the people with a wide Eve experience. The widely experienced players usually still have some narrow realm of expertise, but more knowledge of the game outside of that and can intelligently weigh in on many aspects of the game. The ultra specialized players who know only one tiny aspect of the game spend most of their time unable to contribute.
---
unsubbed, biomassed, uninstalled game, uninstalled Steam, formatted C, shreddered my PC completely, cancelled my ISP, burned down my house, moved to another country.
---
It doesn't count when we blob goons with capitals.
---
So next trip CCP will pay for food and CSM can pay for plane ticket and lodging.
---
You're deliberately missing the fact that it's a game where people actively want to kill each other. For them, the economy is a means to an end to achieve that goal, whereas your original statement (that capitalism is a destructive system) holds that violence is a means to achieve the goal of gaining wealth. 
---
Everything ends at some point. I've already madd peace with the fact that the ccp pre 2009 which had lofty ambitions has turned into a soulless corporation which doesnt understand its own game anymore since crucible (yes you read that right).
---
Who’s the ging?
---
I guess I see why you think that, but honestly how do you actually know that's what's happening? You can have a negative attitude about literally everything, but tens of thousands of people are enjoying their time spent in New Eden every day regardless of your pessimism.
---
And don't act like micro transactions are even a remote surprise in any multiplayer game in existence nowadays. Fuck, even some single player games have them now.
---
When CCP cared
---
[Aryth 4D chess?](https://i.imgur.com/afccgYh.png)

Just expect CCP to do the absolute bare minimum to extract the most money out of you guys.

CCP will probably pull their usual crap of promising big changes coming soon but just wait... its all a charade.

I think this is the only negative post that I agree with lol
---
I want 5x the disappointment, or else its not worth it and im unsubbing.
---
I'm glad that we get to skip tournament burnout and just go straight to quitting this year
---
r/Eve is free, if you want to save money...
---
Thanks for promoting me from F to D tier &lt;3

bring back eve-bet
---
Sisi requires consent to pvp.  So any groups messing with a tournament would be banned from sisi. 
---
That's what I said when my employees got irritated at me for having manager lunches at the strip club.
---
CCP as a company ceased to exist when they were bought by Pearl Abyss. Now they are the arm of PA which develops and manages Eve online. If/when Eve closes down, so will the Eve department. Maybe some staff will redeploy, maybe not.
---
Depressing thought - when Blizzard was bought by Activision no one saw the last 48 hours coming. Blizzard is *obviously* dead now but they were *actually* dead the moment they were sold to another business.
---
You mean that one can actually unsub without posting on reddit?!?!
---
&gt;best
---
Lmao. Best at the AT you mean. Also collusion.
---
CCP's eggs are actually owned to 5 venture capitalists. So in a way they have diversified about $35million, just in the wrong direction.
---
best comment of this thread TBH
---
Sort of. You're not really "giving CCP money" by buying plex off the market to sub because that plex was already bought and paid for. A perceived demand for plex in the minds of the people who spend RL money on plex then list them ingame is what gives CCP more money. It may be a small distinction, but it's there just the same.
---
When folks like Watson here (and myself) resolve to stop giving CCP any of our own money, it can't be good news for CCP... even if we coast along for a while buying plex off the market until our assets dwindle away or we get fed up enough that we stop playing entirely. Good news for CCP is when they make actual, meaningful changes to the game and offer a discount for 6- and 12-month subs, and then dudes like me get excited and throw several hundred bucks at CCP all at once to keep a bunch of accounts subbed for months regardless of whether I want to stick with the game next week or not.
---
You can add clocks to the Taskbar in Windows... I'd imagine that's possible in other OSs, I have local, UT, and various time zones for friends across the globe.
---
I'd recommend that you take it slow. Maybe sequester 3b to buy pvp ships, which will last a long time if you don't go too expensive. Find out what you like doing, and do more research on what kinds of isk making are accessible to you. Don't expect to stay in your current corp/alliance forever, as you might see a good opportunity in the near future. 
---
Look into other isk sources, like exploration with a cloaky frigate, daytripping wormholes with dual boxed battleships. Maybe market games. If something doesn't seem entertaining, or too inaccessible, then just don't bother with it. It's a game first and foremost, and it's perfectly fine to just blow all the money PvPing if you find it fun. 
---
Oh, and really do consider making an alt account. A single VNI right now doesn't make much, but 2 VNIs will make double that, and having a second alt offers you a scout, a cyno, or double the industry/PI slots. 
---
Everything that has happened in the game has been the result of the players using the tools CCP has given them. CCP changes the tools, the players adapt and create new content. 
---
The Goons didn’t come into existence because of some mechanic CCP created. CCP didn’t create BOB or PL or NC. All of these groups exist because players put them together. To act like if CCP doesn’t change a mechanic the game is over is absurd. 
---
The AT is an event. It’s an event they are not hosting for a year. It sucks, and I wish they would do it, but it’s not the end of the world or the end of the game. They will do it next year, and Falcon has already said he will make sure that happens. 
---
I play the game every day. I’ve been playing for thirteen years. It blows my mind that people are actually arguing that CCP is somehow responsible for content in this game. That’s nuts. 
---
Aryth alone blows the smug average. 
---
There's a general downtrend atm. look at the bottom chart that shows all time. 
---
Curious how many r/Eve players actually are subbed in Eve Online.
---
Given how ccp works making a lot of noise about why you're unsubbing on /r/eve normally works the best
---
Russian renters 2.0
---
That's likely not quite how it is - and the Empires certainly aren't working with the Drifters.
---
Jamyl had the Other trapped in her head, and it wasn't able to leave. There's a hidden string for the Vigilant Tyrannos CEO that suggests there's another, truer commander for the Drifters.
---
At first glance, it may look like the Drifters were there to kill the Other - but considering that they killed Hilen Tukoss and managed to kidnap his infomorph, they absolutely could have done the same thing with Jamyl to retrieve the Other.
---
Ironically, the reason why so many of us can't give a single fuck about it not happening this year.
---
Why don’t the alliances that want to participate in an alliance tournament just organize one themselves and hold it in NPC nullsec like the great wildlands?
---
Is that like the department of redundancy department?
---
Shhhhh don’t tell anybody. 
---
Bots botters and alike are complaining. O and multiboxers too, especially those that "forget to turn off their ISBoxers" on regular basis. Rest of us have no complaints since to play normally you never need more then 1 column in the 1st place. But when you bot, you wanna see it like a spreadsheet to make sure all the bots are up and running properly.
---
Already done m8. 
---
Wormholes btw
---
no im pretty sure no one could actually be that stupid 
---
I understand, however only in some instances, not most.
---
FYI you can only unsub once, so if you already used that for a previous disappointment you're out of luck for this one I'm afraid.
---
One way to look at it
---
Cheating already happens when CCP can see everything. Being player run would be rampant. 
---
No prizes which is what makes spending as much as the top teams do and risking former alliance tournament ships worth it. 
---
Would need to be hell camped but then captors can just waltz right through and fuck around with everything anyway. 
---
Literally no way to enforce rules besides just being a nice guy. 
---
Why the /s, it's basically true. A significant proportion of players is bots and alts
---
I've been vacillating between continuing in some reduced manner or just letting my subs run out. Things have started to get stale and life is counter-productive to a lively Eve 'career'. 
---
Fucking idiot 
---
Yeah completely.
---
You really ought to give all those guys on your own game forums some sort of an announcement, otherwise its going to keep on snowballing and you will seriously lose subs over this, like for real.
---
Guardian’s Gala isn’t the only attraction for this season! Semiki plotline continues with a sensational turn as Ishukone CEO Mens Rappola steps in to overturn a CONCORD officer’s asset seizure order. Meanwhile, as per the warnings, the drifter activity in the region steps up as numerous Drifter patrols start to appear in the system. Ishukone Watch reinforces the Zainou station with a standing fleet as capsuleers take care of the unwanted guests.

The alliance tourney really bummed me out... also the fact that it says "An Update!" not "Cancelled"
---
Literally put somerblink back as it was, as an in game, CCP sanctioned feature, and I'd happily click away wasting isk while shooting structures.
---
Bounties are useless in all of eve, it's not just highsec because there return is based on the ship you killed value. 
---
Why the cost of plex going up?? Some changes on game or what??
---
Briefly every now and then
---
higher player count (not account logged in count) than nowadays
---
Now that's a good throwback to the last AT
---
A lootbox is not just the contents. It's the graphics, sometimes the sound, the wait for the item etc. These mechanisms are there to reel people with gambling problems in. That's all it takes. Also, they're being introduced gradually but at some point I think it's inevitable that paid lootboxes appear in the NES store, that will be the start of a total shitshow. I do hope politicians manage to ban this shit before that happens.
---
You can't bet on the AT with real money, I'm pretty sure, because real money gambling is highly regulated and no actual bookmaker was interested in it.
---
I really don't even think haw titans are that broken. They're great at pushing lightly-tanked short range skirmish fleets off objectives like rorquals and citadels under fax umbrellas but the immobility and bad range doesn't make them totally broken. With tank fit to stave off dread bombs they really don't do much more damage than a single haw dread too. 
---
That said tracking on all HAWs should probably be reduced at least by half, and the base range on quad mega pulses should also be reduced. It's pretty silly that with bare minimum effort (2x TC and frentix) quad megas can hit 100+30km range on both the rev and the avatar. Titans being capable of hitting subcaps is an okay thing (as opposed to the first tracking titan nerf where titan guns were basically useless for years afterwards), but the current state of one-shotting untackled dictors in a 120km sphere is a bit over the top.
---
Doesn't even begin to describe it. A lot of people that have switched to the more chill gameplay now log on and play for a month or so along with the event cycles and needless to say, those people ain't very happy, or not happy enough to subscribe or in many cases keep their subscriptions.
---
I'm personally so pissed that I don't even think this is worth plexing, much less paying for it actual $$. My primary PvE toon now stays docked up as alpha. And my primary PvP toon now stays docked up as alpha as well, due to a plethora of reasons for that. So overall, GG CCP.
---
they dont have oil, so you should not be interested in exporting freedom there
---
Yeah that part wasnt good. Always looked forward to the tourney. :/
---
Eh. They aren't really there to do anything but keep the servers from exploding every time we have a mass battle. And even that is a tall order.
---
Any and all fun is going to come from players. Its not their job that we suck terribly at it.
---
If this were true, there’d be no need for Fanfests, no need for conventions, business meetings, legislatures, etc. Clearly, it’s not true. Hell folks in Congress go home every weekend because they’re being good representatives, not bad ones. You can’t be a good representative without face time, and that’s true in EVE as much as it is in any other walk of life.

We do video conferences weekly and they are nothing compared to what we can get done in person in Iceland. And, of course, a huge amount of work is done over lunches, dinners and at the bar. Not on a conference call.

neat

We could put missles there

But without a CSM, how will Alex get his agenda pushed through?

Hillmar?
---
You can't spin it in a positive way for CCP when a player stops spending his own, real money on the game. Yeah, plex costs money too. Yeah, higher plex prices probably cause some more plex to be bought. Etc. But the bottom line is CCP is becoming more and more reliant on CC warrior whales to pay their bills, and more and more players are closer to letting go of Eve for good as they sit around on month-to-month subs with assets dwindling as they pay for more and more expensive plex.
---
I'm sure CCP would love to see a bunch of players reactive alpha accounts with 6- and 12-month sub plans, infusing the company with cash right now regardless of whether those players stop logging in next month or not. But there's more and more people saying "nope!" to that shit in light of CCP's lack of work on a lot of issues that a lot of players are concerned about.

Don't listen to the vocal minority and make your decision based on their complaints.   
---
Reddit and YouTube are great places for addicts to complain about their addictions. 
---
True that. Also as I recall IWantIsk picked up the loyal GRRGONS redditors before, during, and after WorldCasinoWarBee, making criticism of it a downvote trigger.
---
You may think its OK because you havent done the previous ones therefore have no frame of reference, if you did, you'd understand just how fucked up Permafrost was as well. Events were fine, some were actually really weak sauce and some were OK and some great up until they started doing all this BPC shit.
---
From that point on every single event has been steadily worse. More bugs, crappier execution, less rewards for the time, less doable by new players and alphas.
---
I strongly agree with you that CCP should use these oppertunities to show off the deep lore. There are some systemic and staffing issues that prevents this from always being the case, but if your paying attention things do make sense.
---
In this case the Angel Cartel is the largest "pirate" group in New Eden they are known for fast ships, and salvaging anchent technology in the ruins they found in their space.
---
The Angel Cartel have a detatchment known as the Guardian Angels, they are on indefinate security contract with the Serpentis Organisation.
---
The Serpentis is another "Pirate" faction that is a criminal enterprise that uses smugglers to promote illegal drug distribution. 
---
If you would like to know more about what is going on in general, I recommend my [Lore Primer](https://crossingzebras.com/the-eve-lore-primer/) as a launching point. You can also go to EVE's official [Fiction Portal](https://fiction.eveonline.com/)
---
Just to clarify I'm not trying to spin this in ccps direction. They fucked up even though I don't really care much about At its obviously a big part of the attraction to a great deal of players. I was trying to explain to the guy I replied to that dropping a sub and burning existing assets for plex is a better way to do it rather than buying new subs
---
Nice flair
---
Well, when all the content creators who give a shit about Reddit and AT end up quitting EVE, the community will rebalance itself and become Serenity or we will appoint new content creators. vOv
---
obvious joke is obvious
---
All the vunderkids send your CV to ccp im sure after they review your experience and expertise you will be offered the CEO and CTO position. This way you wont waste time posting here, but actually utilize your genious  ideas which ccp somehow finds retarded and laughs at them when in fact those ideas can turn CCP in the next trlion dollar company and eve the best game known to mankind.
---
I have :)
---
Obviously 
---
Against the rules?
---
I think because the target's radial velocity is so low, it can still apply to small shit
---
Gotcha. Lots of people here seem to be acting like it's a good thing for CCP when someone subs with plex instead of a standard subscription, and I thought you were saying that.
---
Or how I stopped worrying and learned to love the downvotes
---
Yes, mine broke in the same way. The gm that handled my support ticket just told me to bug report it without offering to actually reset my task list. Doesn't really matter anyway because this event is shit.
---
This 
---
Nah but I see their point. If you were absolutely mental and bought a load of plex, then used it for a sub it would cost almost 50% more but only a complete numpty would do that 
---
Something something something *already* something something something *replaced*
---
Talk about  "suggesting"
---
Was a fun brawl for sure. After I died I told the loki to leave, and he confidently said, "I can get out any time I want".
---
fuck siigari
---
Maybe when the time to vote for csm is up again ~~
---
When you fc fights on a regular basis and instead of hostiles bring similar ships to counter you and you get dropped gate after gate with bosons and haw titans and supers with 15k m/s speed ..... then read again what you wrote with a straight face
---
I for one have unsubbed 3 accounts this week.
---
But its always been that way so when comparing you can't really use that as an excuse. 
---
Unless you have data that shows botting to be much higher than it used to be.
---
That seems to be more reasonable than the 1500 or "thousands" that have been thrown about. I'll have to look back at what I spent for fanfest for food and shit- the most striking cost to me though was the hotel (cause I never airbnbed it).
---
This going how you planned?

You're obviously not engaging in this discussion in good faith.

Yeah except in 2019 ccp's new schtick is "memes become reality."
---
So...
---
&gt; My Stratios used to do 900 DPS, thats not very much. 
---
no it didn't, there's no way your lone stratios was able to apply that dps without webs and something to keep them tackled on grid, can your stratios drones travel an effectively infinite radius around it while pointing and webbing the target and going 14km with the mwd off of cd?
---
&gt;whereas your original statement (that capitalism is a destructive system) holds that violence is a means to achieve the goal of gaining wealth. 
---
How many people out there are engaging in PvP without a sustainable source of income?
---
&gt;And you still haven't demonstrated any examples that capitalism is unsustainable and destructive (through Eve). 
---
You need only look at the nullsec wars.
---
BWF- is never hell camped or even occupied.  You can safely auto-pilot there.
---
5 boxing a Titan in 1% TiDi is the true endgame of Eve.
---
And yet if all the above was true, what then would be the point of the csm?
---
Its next on the chopping block, but its allready actually dead
---
So you want to go to someone's home and shit on them without them using their huge defensive avantage against you ? Nice.
---
Ask people that do that everyday and succeed how they do it then ?
---
considering your liberal use of the word fascist. i'd guess your not either.
---
find a different word other than your trigger word of the day, and then come back.
---
and while your at it. should probably look into why capitalism works in so many real life countries,  when socialism has repeatedly crashed and burned.
---
hell even china had to adopt forms of capitalism.
---
Ive been saying this for almost a year now. And few listened. Thing is. You won't fix much in big empires where they mine with multiple rorquals. They will fitt panix except one really tanked who can light the cyno and sustain the damage for a while
---
There are a few things that I think need to be countered here. 
---
**" Literally every Dev blog the past few months has been about non-gameplay related issues. We had 2 Dev blogs alone, talking about security updates. Then another 2 dev blogs talking about chat. "**
---
First off local chat was a major complaint by the community for a while when it was broken. So I don't see how 2 dev blogs about it is a bad thing. Unless you're complain that they need to do more beyond those topics? The community complained about something and CCP fixed it and communicated about it. 
---
**" Fighter application needs a kick in the nuts, end of story. After the removal of ECM as a counter to fighters, the only thing that can realistically be done by roaming gangs is either, always bring logi, or 100mn ships that are worth 2-3x the cost of the carrier they're trying to kill. "**
---
I can see the complaint of fighter application 1 tapping frigs and such but I can tell you that the last part of your statement is not true. I have been on multiple 10-20 Kiki 1mn fleets that have held grid with multiple supers... No application issues. The ships are not more than 300mil-400mil. I don't think solo pvper's should be able to hold grid with a super. 
---
**" HAW Titans need to go. Not because i feel they're OP, but because Titans have no business shooting subcaps. Its the same reason there isn't a battlecruiser bonused to RLML's. Battlecruiser's counter cruisers, they're not meant to counter frigates and destroyers. Just like Titans aren't meant to counter subcaps, they should be direct counters to capitals/super carriers. "**
---
This contradicts your earlier statement. If every larger ship is supposed to counter lower ships then what do carriers counter? Other carriers? You've asked for the removal of fighter application. You have dreds/supers to bash with so now what do carriers do? The point is that carriers are meant to counter sub caps. That is their roll. Maybe they're only supposed to counter cruisers up?
---
Also I do not thing that a single saber/hic should be able to indefinitely point a properly fit capital (maybe we can argue carriers and dreds but definitely not supers). Thats just OP to know the second you see a saber/hictor on you unless you get friends to save you you're supers dead or at the mercy of the tackler bordum. You should be able to fight back if properly fit and shed tackle. 
---
**" Depending on the route that is taken for rebalancing capitals, rebalancing cyno's can either be ignored (if capitals lose their ability to apply to subs), or the cyno inhib mechanics and how they interrupt cyno's needs to be modified. Right now someone can open a cyno 5 seconds before a cyno inhib onlines, and then the cyno remains on and cycling as long as the pilot doesn't cycle it off. The inhib should act like a scram does for a prop mod, and immediately turn off the cyno. The inhib also needs actually resistances so logi can rep it. And if the cyno remains an instant "ON" module, the cyno inhib should be a nearly instant "ON" deployable. "** 
---
This seem slightly over powered but I agree that cyno inhibs should get a boost. Increase the resistance, shorter online time, and it decycles the cyno. I don't think it should turn off the cyno instantly. Maybe it reduces all cynos by 10 seconds every second? IDK but I agree there should be a tweek. 
---
Appreciate your post interesting topic. 
---
I heard the new event was very newbie unfriendly which really sucks, makes it pointless imo. Those of us playing 6months+ have plenty. 
---
I read it and made what I think is a constructive response. 
---
Every time I pop back in here on my once or twice a month check in and see someone talk about HAW titans I laugh.
---
Say that to INIT boosh raven killing a keepstar defended by a big part of the North supercapitals ?
---
Remember Pure Blind this summer ? Ask people that were there to explain how to avoid a titan bosoning you at every gate.
---
I agree that you cannot KILL them easily. Then again, it's the same thing when you try to kill a marauder with frigates, it's hard, it requires it being alone and you bringing numbers, so what ?
---
And you idiots trust them with balance patches? FFS CCP, it's almost like you're trying to be retarded
---
Quit like a man yeesh
---
Shooting it RN. There's two of us.
---
That actually explains why things that go here doesn't usually do much. Most people who whine here are already non-playing because of what they complain about. My trouble is that I, someone who's okay with what I'm already doing, am one of those that gets shooed away from the game because of the nonstop complaining, as if there's no hope left and I should abandon ship already.
---
Well, I never said Abyssal pvp was a good thing. But it does feel like a first step towards some sort of arena pvp, and I know a lot of smaller groups and solo pvp'ers would welcome that change cause they are tired of getting supers dropped on them constantly from larger alliances who thinks thats proper pvp.  
---
So for any small gang loving corp/alliance, arena pvp would probably be a welcome addition to this game, and thats actually a fair few. Hell you would think even goons would love the idea as it would stop some ppl from fucking with their miners...
---
Because they dont care anymore fyi.
---
But you have no clear goals or objectives now....
---
Probably - if you could only get 50 million ISK for spending $20 on PLEX I doubt many would do it. 
---
Yeah titans generally go for 50-70 billion. Get saving!
---
Careful with non-consensus opinions, there, citizen. You and I both know what happens if the discourse is not exactly and perfectly harmonious.
---
&gt; If your CSM member needs two all-inclusive trips to represent you, you've got a bad representative.
---
In other words, 99% of politicians in the world are bad representatives. Got it. 
---
Shills
---
The best guess I've seen so far is that plex prices were temporarily depressed by a series of sales. Those sales are restricted to once per account, so at this point we've gone through most of the people who were inclined to buy at the sale price and sell effectively discounted plex.
---
Boosh Ravens are a gimmick that only works on Keepstars thanks to the model's massive size. They're useless against supercap blobs, you can go ask the FCs who came up with it yourself if you don't believe me. 
---
The issue isn't just that they're not easy to kill, it's also how easily they kill *everything else*. When you combine those two things you create an environment where supercaps slowly replace all other forms of PVP to the detriment of the game as a whole.
---
I'm not going to explain any more to you.
---
That’s literally unimaginable... I didn’t even see those in the market. Do you have an idea of what ship would be good for me to aim for? I play a lot of solo and am just doing career agents, not sure what else I could branch out to yet but I’m just learning the basics pretty much.
---
Thats my plan. -6 accounts until this game gets fixed. There is a whole real life out there.
---
I've played on and off since beta 6 in 2003.  I don't care about the AT really either.
---
Look at all the CSMs coming out of the woodwork in this thread.
---
why is CCP balancing the game around pve content? 
---
I figured it out mostly, basically I should apply a simplex algorithm maximizing some arbitrary objective function (as I only care about the values of the variables) constrained by the reprocessing matrix. I just need to implement the algorithm now.
---
I got told recently that PIZZA essentially became Skill Urself, true?
---
&gt; Its almost like there are various groups within the r/eve hivemind that don't agree with each other.
---
That's obvious, and misses my point. If those groups agree with each other, why is every discussion a mindless circlejerk dominated by a single opinion? If there were a diversity of views being represented, we'd see that. Instead, it's just different viewpoints taking their turn in the sun for a second.
---
For fuck's sake this sub was dominated by pissed-off PvE'rs mad about the Guardian's Gala sites just yesterday. I see many of those same people making CCPls post about the GG sites defending capital proliferation &amp; the death of small gang pvp. And yet here we are today, and /r/eve is dominated by pvp'ers pissed off about the AT.
---
There isn't a diversity of views, people come to /r/eve to rant and circlejerk. This is a place where valuable discussion dies a horrible, shitposty death.
---
Lol at skillu being #1 at anything but folding and running at the first site of a counter form up.
---
Real mens. 
---
Factor in alphas, rampant botting and serious multiboxing.
---
Eve player base representation is a complete joke in the CSM. Either reform it or just kill it.
---
This is literally going to be like watching paint dry. With max skills and optimized fits everyone will come in within small margin.
---
Superficially, I agree with you. However, I'll point out that this is EVE, and we're *good* at impossible-seeming projects. I bet you could get a bunch of significant groups to sign on to permanently blacklist anyone who interferes with the AT2.0, and to annihilate any organization that harbors them. You'd probably get a few people who would try it anyway, but then you're looking at the AT2.0 as both a tournament and an organic content-driver.
---
I also saw a suggestion to put the tournament matches in w-space, which could be used to mitigate the interceptor threat. Pick some C3 and don't publish the system in advance. On the day of, roll for a good connection and tell the team captains of the two teams where to go. Roll the hole shut behind them.
---
A succinct post that covers pretty much all the major facets of the game in need of addressing.
---
Holy fuck I never thought I'd see it on r/EVE.

They used to hold it in another location .. there are other places in Iceland they could have used. Maybe not as nice, but there are definetly other locations.
---
That gold Jerry! Gold!
---
*THE HOLES... WHERE ARE THEY*
---
Because the CSM totally gets access to CCP's accounting database and can independently run the numbers on player retention &amp; wardecs.
---
Brisc actually has all your purchase history and credit card numbers right now, but he won't do anything with that 'cause he's such a nice guy.
---
That's what she said... 
---
Yeah you won't find regular capitals on sale in high sec since they can't be made there or brought into it. Once you have some confidence and experience no doubt you'll branch out (which you definitely should) to low sec, null sec, or wormholes and at that point much more of the game will open up to you.
---
Finding a friendly new player focused group that can give you guidance and support is well worth your time, Pandemic horde, Brave and karma fleet are all good examples but there are many other smaller entities that do an amazing job too. A bigger group just means more people to learn from and generally a more inclusive atmosphere for whatever activities interest you.
---
Focus on learning the basics, generally bigger does not often mean better. For now stick to frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
---
As others have said use the internet to do research about activities that interest you and then get a cheap ship and fit and go give it a go. Just remember that knowledge is often more useful than how much isk you have or what ship your'e flying. If you have more questions you're welcome to private message me and I'll do my best to help you find an answer!
---
Fly dangerous o7
---
Why don't you write some? I'd read it, although I'll warn you right now that your blase use of "fact" in this context suggests that you haven't done your research yet.

I believe I do, but perhaps you're right 
---
&gt; The ever expanding chains of keepstars - enabled by beloved mechanics like PANIC
---
what
---
There's a few things you need to do in order to get this game working, you will also need to downgrade libfreetype. 
---
The syntax to symlink libssl is "ln -s /path/to/libssl.so /path/to/launcher/libssl.so", same for libcrypto.
---
Also downgrade libfreetype6 to 2.8.
---
&gt; such as the ECM and interceptor changes, both of which are a very blatant duo of changes that largely benefit krabs
---
you mean the changes that were loudly asked for by solo pvpers (ECM) and everyone who does sov fights (fozzieclaws)?
---
[Here, this should help.](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=monthly+economic+report+eve) 
---
Yeah, I was flying with LV at the time. Was a great time to be a pilot.
---
I'm afraid I don't understand. Tell me how mining builds keepstars.
---
Certainly not I.
---
Same same. Used to be in MC at the time. Great times were had. Trying to get back into it last year, I just see everyone I knew has moved on and compared to yesteryear its difficult to find the amount of time to amount to anything in EVE these days.
---
You're  right but spodbrains gonna downvote
---
Thanks for all the info! I’ll definitely try branching out more in the near future, and I’ve actually already found a group I’m pretty happy with. They’ve been nice so far and said they’d be willing to help me if I had questions but I ask questions here when I can’t get on.
---
I’m just now realizing that you aren’t supposed to  only have 1 ship and stick with it, since different ships do different things well. I believe I’m gonna try and get into mining or something and take a more industrial path, I haven’t really explored any military career agents yet so I don’t know what I’m getting into there but we will see.
---
I am alpha still but eventually once I know more about what I’m doing I’ll go omega, not sure what it provides yet but it shouldn’t be to hard to figure out. 
---
What prevents CCP from doing balance changes? Isn't it tweaking a few numbers, see what happens and then change these numbers again if it's still bad?
---
Elaborate?
---
&gt; If you think the key things the CSM does are in the minutes, you don't know how the CSM works
---
I'm not saying that, but it's the easy to see part
---
Nice edit. However, mining is inherently untaxable at scale. Mining doesn't build keepstars. Moreover, keepstars are extremely cheap.
---
It's okay for businesses to come and go; there's no *need* for them to mutate and continue to exist.  It's better in the long run that businesses start and end, rather than transmuting over decades into whatever makes money that year.  Companies closing on a regular basis reshuffles people, gives the meritorious more opportunity to climb and forces the deadwood that maintain their positions through social maneuvering and bureaucratic inertia to justify being hired. 
---
I was still having good times. 
---
Like what is your end goal ? ( like why make money what are you hoping to achieve with it ).

Two teams enter, one team leaves.

Hey gay im gay to.

You should contract all your shit to SirPaco Wallace. I will keep you from playing this garbage game.

OK I've got another one for you since you're being *really* (deliberately) obtuse. What really cheap material forms the basis of supercapital production?
---
What form of income is automatically taxed by the game?

Big cripes tbh

Hopefully you recognize you needed to put a TL;DR in front of the last paragraph.     
---
KThxBai!

The fact that you ask for anything at all is too much for CCP.

It happens to represent people like you. Or anyone who is dumb enough to vote for Trump. But that's another story. Stop trying, because you're embarrassing yourself.

Not just you.

I like that eve is a perpetual sandbox, and this staged “safe” fair fighting with set rules always went against what I felt eve is supposed to be.  Let the players drive their own tournament if that’s what they want to do, nothings stopping them from trying.  If people interfere and want to piss in your sandbox and try and ruin it, well.... that’s eve.

Isn't this the exact same thing he did with his titan?

The fact you keep responding shows you do. Watch this...  I bet you'll lay down some sweet ass comeback. Let's see if I give two shits what you say... if I even read it. Heh 
---
Hmm, this launcher doesn't have a clock on it either...
---
Keepstars are dirt cheap right now because ore is now dirt cheap. Rorq mining may not contribute to keepstar building money, but it slaps the cost of a keepstar to some crazy level. Heck, it probably only cost you 120B or so to build a keepstar in delve nowadays.
---
forgive me its been 17 days, still unacceptable.
---
Yeah for sure don't try to stick to one ship, the game is built around different ships having different roles and strengths. Also while it might seem obvious, don't fly what you can't afford to lose and don't carry all of your stuff with you, leave it in a 'home' station of your choosing. High sec is generally safe but ganking (blowing you up before concord- the police, get there to intervene) does happen everyday and their targets are generally expensive ships and people who can't fight back i.e miners and industrialists.
---
I'm sure the group you've joined is a bunch of decent people but many groups exist, especially in high sec, with the sole intent of farming new players for taxes. If their tax rate is above 10% or they start forcing you to sell ore to them for shitty prices etc don't be afraid to shop around for another group that offers you more or asks less of you.
---
Lastly, if anything seems even remotely dodgy, its a scam. Most of the best scams don't look like scams at all. I cannot say this enough ....**DOUBLE CHECK EVERYTHING AND TRUST NO ONE WITHOUT EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD REASONS.** Take it easy bud.
---
I am referring directly to falcon's comments last night on talking in stations where he said all community engagement at CCP runs at a loss so they are cutting things back to save money which is primarily why the Alliance Tournament is now on hiatus. As to why they are not doing in the event in Iceland there are multiple theories one including them firing the event manager at CCP and not replacing them and then not having anyone do the job which resulted in them not being able to reserve the site in Iceland for the traditional date.
---
Oh boy, are we going to use third and fourth order effects to argue literally anything? That's fun!
---
And it still doesn't touch the core issue -- keepstar production is limited by PI throughput, not ISK. You don't magically turn ISK into keepstars -- you gotta get PI first. No amount of pathetic hand-wringing about a mining report is going to make more PI appear.

So well written i had tears in my eyes. Sadly CCP will never take note of any of this, cause the CSM is run by goons trying to convince ccp everything is as it should be
---
Probably fired who ever was running it, OR they're focusing their efforts on BALANCE! :)
---
I decided to do this a while back and am waiting for a one year sub to lapse, which is this weekend. Little did I know that CCP would substantially pile on reasons to quit in the months between then and now. 
---
Without outing who I am, I was also one of those touched by your pew pew. You gave me encouragement in my understanding of my pvp fights early in my career. I'm still no hot shot, but now all I do is pvp (and poorly at that).

I'm sorry for you loss but I'm glad you let us all in on your EVE is Real moment.
---
you just gave 0.5/10 to 99% of r/eve posts

... no it doesn't. Have you ever looked at the bill of materials of a keepstar? [Here, I'll help you.](https://eve-industry.org/calc/?q=keepstar&amp;techlevel=1&amp;byoc=true&amp;id=36968&amp;runs=1&amp;jobs=1&amp;te=20&amp;me=10&amp;materials_modifier=1&amp;cte=20&amp;cme=10&amp;c_materials_modifier=1&amp;enc=5&amp;dc1=5&amp;dc2=5&amp;decryptor=0&amp;skill_m=0.80&amp;implant_m=1.0&amp;facility_m=1&amp;solarSystem_m=Osmon&amp;taxRate_m=10&amp;skill_mc=0.80&amp;implant_mc=1.0&amp;facility_mc=1&amp;solarSystem_mc=Osmon&amp;taxRate_mc=10&amp;skill_te=0.75&amp;implant_te=1.0&amp;facility_te=1&amp;solarSystem_te=Osmon&amp;taxRate_te=10&amp;skill_me=0.75&amp;implant_me=1.0&amp;facility_me=1&amp;solarSystem_me=Osmon&amp;taxRate_me=10&amp;skill_c=0.75&amp;implant_c=1.0&amp;facility_c=1&amp;solarSystem_c=Osmon&amp;taxRate_c=10&amp;facility_i=1&amp;solarSystem_i=Osmon&amp;taxRate_i=10&amp;advanced_industry=5) What's the most significant part of the expense?
---
problem is...where do we go from EVE?
---
no other game like it.  and honestly its less of being concerned about where CCP is going(because their focus on quality of life is generally good. specially 64 bit client),  and more being concerned about stuff that needs to be addressed that we haven't had any word on in a while, and so are unsure if CCP is aware of it.
---
Meh, too much effort, better to just unsub and play a better game.
---
nah man im selling it all to igor in moscow for 1000 rubles so he can fit his t5 gila.
---
Fuck you, I've played eve for 6 months now, and given my experience in sales at Target, I am in the unique position to fix this company.
---
Well yes, go figure how much a tritanium worth before rorq is released.
---
paco its me strovolos im broke again so i would appreciate it to be put on top of that list...ill pay you in 195 male exotic dancers and 197 female exotic dancers...thx 
---
Dumb strawman 
---
It's obviously just saying that the relative cost between flight and food will be very different 
---
&gt;you need a lot of pilots out ratting in their supers in order to be able to jump to anyone who gets into trouble.
---
dumb question, but as someoen who hasn't lived under a super umbrella, is the how they work?  ratting supers responding?  or is there a pvp super fleet on call? o.0
---
ddos the monument?
---
ironically its easier to build a keepstar than their rigs apparently...cause rigs you need more salvage than jita provides
---
I love Frank. The Memes never get quit.
---
I feel pretty much the same but the AT, streaming and all that business is important to a lot of people in the active community and without these guys creating content I think the game would have been put out to pasture long before now.
---
/u/outerarm /u/codfishcandy
---
It was just such a magical time to play. I started in Red Moon Rising, still remember undocking my Velator from Duripant for the first time.
---
That war was so crazy. BoB was legendary, but Ascendant Frontier had over 5000 pilots and built the first titan which was piloted by Cyv0k. It got blown up pretty quick and ASCN got steamrolled along with that Russian alliance that made this amazing last stand in their last system, won, and then teamed up with Goons and starting fighting back against BoB. Then the Northern Alliances like D2 declared war but BoB steamrolled them and took their territory. Then Mercenary Coalition stabbed BoB in the back but they still wouldn't go down. I know they were eventually beaten, but I can't remember how it all end.
---
Honestly, EVE was such a great thing for me as a teenager. I was a horribly awkward and shy as a kid and EVE let me practice my social skills in a low risk environment. After the war I joined Veto Corp and had the most fun I've ever had in a video game doing lowsec pirating. Verone and the gang accepted me as one of their own, even when I was being an obnoxious teenager. &lt;3 /u/CCPFalcon Honestly, that's been one of the biggest hindrances to me getting back into the game, my character still has like a -9.5 security rating. Are there any easy ways to get that back up these days?
---
EVE also taught me so much about economic theory. My dad couldn't give a rats-ass about video games but he was always so impressed by what I was learning from the game. He really tried to understand it, and got good enough that he could explain to his coworkers what his son was so passionate about. 
---
I still have my EVE Magazines. Gosh I loved those, they were so well produced. I devoured the short stories on the website. I was really into writing and started penning columns for an EVE Newspaper. I remember I got paid 20-25 million ISK per article and it was my primary source of income in the game. It was a really great way as a young kid to practice my writing skills. It must have worked. 12/13 years later I have penned multiple published works for which have paid real money instead.
---
EVE is always in my heart. It's even my Reddit username. Gallente ships were my favorite.
---
Here we have a congressman using congress as an example of a comparable and functioning organization
---
The group I’m in actually has 0% tax rate and overall they seemed generally happy to have a newer player like myself, especially since I was able to join in on comms with them. If they do end up raising the taxes I might ask them about it.
---
And I’ve heard about these scams and I will definitely keep watch, thanks again for everything you’ve been a great help.
---
# btw MCAV IS RECRUITING!!!!!!!!
---
EU FOLKS ONLY...WE HAVE ENOUGH YANKYDOODLES
---
CCP is in its final death spiral. They've stopped investing money and are now at the squeeze every last penny out of their players before they shut server down. 
---
Unsub now, before you waste more money
---
No, just to the special snowflake that apparently thinks EVE Online is the only product where the consumers have opinions about it.
---
If you actually looked, you'd see that the total amount of trit needed to build a keepstar is 1,830,600,000 isk. The Jita price for trit (massively inflated) is 4.46 isk according to our price proxy right now. Because I assume most reading this are incapable of multiplication, that resolves to 8.1b ISK worth of trit. A keepstar is about 200b. 
---
Lmbo
---
fear hillmar, i imagine he has a scorched eve strategy in place there is no way pearl abyss will get $400 million from eve, they would have have hang on to it for another 3 years of it dying even to break even. 
---
I don't think it will even come back as a pay to watch event because that would require effort on their part and Falcon has already hinted that they think community events should be the focus which basically boils down to CCP outsourcing the AT to the players so its free and they don't have to spend any money.    
---
Also for those keeping score at home we are approaching the 6 month point since CCP was sold which is usually about the point in time when the new owner starts to exert control of the new company.... anyone still think Pearl Abyss isn't going to completely shit up eve?
---
If you look now, has it changed? _May_ have been a caching problem of some sort.
---
(because I'm seeing the valentine's day sale stuff now. and it came up a few hours ago)
---
And that's T1, often. God help you if you want T2 rigs, and I don't even mean the cost.
---
Idk that's how, you sell that ore u get the isk to buy pi mats then you get the keepstar
---
Best era. Me and my muffins of mayhem Boys would raid fix and Bob and run your static blood plexes
---
Also entirely possible.
---
yeah. its scary.  xD  almost makes me want to go into the salvage business.
---
Kids without a clue.
---
both.
---
Your main pvp fleet is stagednat a central location and can reach all the ratting systems.
---
It really hasn't always been that way. But whatever you say 
---
ISK doesn't magically transmute into PI. You have to acquire the PI from someone. PI is in high demand and there isn't enough of it to go around.
---
Are you flair baiting? Everyone (in goons at least) knows you buy ore 70% jita buy in 1DQ.
---
i heard my little pony online is fucking brutal!!!

That’s some compelling evidence 
---
I was using the worst-case scenario to inflate the cost. If you want to argue that the ratio of a keepstar's cost that's due to minerals is even less, then by all means, give me the rope.
---
42 thousand

for inspiration :)

Hi, I'm a bot (in Beta). I combined your list of YouTube videos into one shareable highlight reel link:  https://app.hivevideo.io/view/23249c
---
 You can play through the whole highlight reel (with timestamps if they were in the links), or select each video.
---
 Reply with the word ignore and I won't reply to your comments.
---
There have always been bots and there has always been people multiboxing. 
---
I would love to see the data on botting cause it feels like theres more of it now but it might just be more obvious. 
---
Ok. 100 isk and 1 trit. Daily. Done and done.
---
While i agree with almost everything, i am downvoting because of what you said about cyno’s. They are perfectly fine the way they are, and should not be changed.
---
Make them spawn randomly around the game and add Royale to Eves name
---
Oof this is a new low for this sub
---
i love how this AMAZING SALE is a fucking 10% discount... yea no CCP , fuck that 
---
Remove fuel from things, please CCP.
---
Also, here.
---
https://i.imgur.com/n3ClRBJ.png
---
If it's not playable why do you play it? 
---
dont forget the +80% bc of BIO4 
---
Historically?  &lt;10 ISK per unit.  Usually hovered around 3-5.
---
It's currently 4-ish.
---
My god....look at that huge drop.
---
(You needed to point at the other materials.  Trit hasn't been hit nearly as hard as the others)
---
Because the AT whine is not about ship v ship combat, it is about the injection of multiple trillion isk worth of rare assets to a small group of people.
---
All you do is have to rewind back 1 year to see all the whine about a FULL CPP AT (minus reward ships) and all the fucking whiney spam about it.  You see, the elite shit bads even made multiple teams that year so they could farm even more AT ships, since their free-isk moon goo is now gone.
---
So what made the previous ones so great?
---
sweet
---
even drifters are sick of the shit amaarians do 
---
Obviously the players that care about the AT are upset. I’m going to take a wild guess that they don’t give a flying fuck what you think.
---
 does this mean im just 1 more missed AT away from buying CCP's intellectual property for pennies on the dollar?  
---
CCPLZ skip more ATs.
---
Lol eve has not always been about having 15 accounts.... that's a tiny tiny tiny minority of the player base. 
---
eh,  MLPO isn't my cup of tea.
---
FoE is still in the works.
---
Far far more bots and alts these days. I'd wager it's 5x-10x more than 10 years ago. 
---
Actual players are disappearing very fast
---
What's with everyone editing their responses? Say what you want the first time.
---
Markets aren't an infinite font of whatever the fuck you want. They have limits. You can only pull so much blood from any given stone. We could actually be botting as much as people ejaculate over on this forum, reaping $TEXAS in tax revenue, and we'd still be rate limited on keepstar production due to PI availability.
---
I guess time will tell :)
---
Please share your killboard
---
damn that is impressive, i want it 
---
And the bad changes the csm prevented like rorquals being invulnerable, excavators, skill injectors, fatigue less jump bridges, instant online and off lining cynos, etc
---
I'm glad the csm can prevent giggly imbalanced things from entering the game 
---
I'm no programmer but I think if developing and maintenance of a game of this caliber would be as easy as you put it then half of the human population would be game developers.
---
and thats ok man. Again, I dont see why CCP took away something so important to these folks...   
---
I just dont see its appeal. Thats all im saying.
---
&gt; Also I do not think that a single saber/hic should be able to indefinitely point a properly fit capital
---
It's always been fine for interceptors to be able to do that to battleships. It's a good thing if you need different fleet roles to be successful.
---
Stupidest question ive had to ask, but how does a HIC scram work,  I just assumed it worked like a normal scram once your pointed but I was scrammed and it turned off my mwd so I was ok im dead lol but in a random attempt to try and get away while still scrammed my mwd turned back on. Is the mwd effect only temporary?
---
Dude my thoughts exactly. I hate how everyone on my teams loathed practice. 
---
I loved every second of having instant, even, content without needing to roam for hours and still gamble on getting a shit fight. 
---
I wish there was another game with the same level of depth :(
---
I heard they were going to do a live stream of random people fleet mining, but during trials it was so obvious that everyone they looked at was multiboxing or botting that they scrapped the plan so they wouldn't have to permaban 10,000 simultaneous users. 
---
As well as removing the free bonus PLEX they are also pricing now in USD. With the current exchange rate and the 10% Valentine's Day discount they are still charging more than when it was in Euros (and of course no bonus).
---
Well, what I'm saying is simple, ore nowadays is way too cheap comparing to other stuff and there's definitely a reason.
---
I remembered that trit is about 7-10 (4 now) isk per around 2012 (and that is after a major buff to mining barges), but PLEX during then is about 1.5M (3.5M at least now), so basically with the inflation of ISK, ore devalued about 500% in 6 years. So if there's no rorq, we can safely assume a keepstar should at least cost 80B more than nowadays, which is a much reasonable number comparing to nowadays.
---
Even most ships are forced into just one or two fits.  It used to be a mystery how a ship was fit. Now? Nope
---
Eve is a pvp game???? I never knew...
---
Many of the past events were 'good' for many players, and enjoyed by them.  Your feelings aren't useful for understanding them because *they are not you*.
---
Don't misunderstand me, I'm not saying supercap blob are fine and shouldn't be touched, it's the warfare and the proliferation that are the issues here.
---
As much as I find supercarrier not that much retarded, haw titans are. You cannot do anything against a HAW titan with a subcap gang, which isn't true for a supercarrier, let alone the fact that the tank is nowhere near the same.
---
Let's be honest, if you leave it like this, it is bad. If you render supers inneffective against subcaps, you effectively render them useless.
---
I get dank frags and have fun doing it, who cares if your some kind of puppet master changing big things. 
---
Way to make me wax nostalgic :-(
---
Good for you.
---
Next year will be shoving our keepstar in our avatar 
---
He’s probably worried you’re too dumb to read a regular paragraph 🤔
---
You should be thankful! 
---
Better question is what does your statement here add to the conversation? Nothing? Thought so
---
For me it's just... Lack of words how they fail with so many of events, its like no one even try to design them or test, srly those people get $ for this? Im 100% sure i would design it better in max few days, that's just pathetic.
---
CCP wake the fu.. up because from some time You just show that You don't even care about game, little new content or redesigns (and most of game areas need it), no balance etc
---
WHAT IS THIS REAL WORLD YOU SPEAK OF.... I READ ALL THE PATCH NOTES AND IT NEVER FUCKING MENTIONS THIS "REAL WORLD" BULLSHIT. 
---
CCP BAN THIS FOOL FOR.. well.. whatever. just ban him.... hes probably a bot anyways.
---
Well, check how ISK is inflating. Note a PLEX is about 1.5M in around 2015.
---
I don’t see the point of your post, is what I’m saying. All you are saying is “AT cancelled, oh well doesn’t affect me, sucks to be those guys”
---
Why even post that thought on social media unless you are 
---
A: retarded
---
B: troll
---
C: PR account for CCP or PA
---
D: combine A&amp;B
---
It is players who make the blue doughnut. They’ve been given the sandbox and that’s what they’ve done with it. Your sandbox doesn’t have to be on the macro scale - although it certainly can be, and if it’s not it’s simply no one’s fault but your own.
---
Also. Can I have your stuff?

Not a set amount, ISK and minerals inside of loot boxes.  You get one per day automatically for logging in and you earn more by running Abyssal PvP arena fights.
---
I already gave it away sry
---
I read it.         
---
+1        
---
it's gone 
---
Do you have any to the contrary? No one here has evidence other than our experiences, and only an idiot or a bother thinks the botting problem has always been this bad
---
Alek....I can call you alek right? Thanks.
---
Well written article. Whilst it is obvious to many that your emotion has played a part in it's creation, I agree with many of your points. I did however leave thinking so what?.
---
What do we do from here?
---
I've seen several comments saying botting and alts, but I remember it being pretty bad in the past. It has been years since they banned input broadcasting, but I remember a significant drop in players logged in afterwards due to all of the alts that people stopped using. Is there any evidence that right now it is worst than the past? 
---
I've never even watched a clip of the at in over a decade of playing eve. Arena style PvP is basically the opposite of what I like about eve PvP. But I can see why other players enjoy seeing the "best of the best" go at it.
---
Proof?
---
just to fly some spaceships and chill out, it's a game.
---
I wonder what will happen with the price of some of the AT ships that are used much more in the AT than solo/small gang pvp (etana, rabisu, ect)
---
leave me the fuck alone crazy bot...
---
you keep botting in drone lands and ill keep posting links, ok!
---
I like carriers the way they are, but perhaps a slight nerf to application would be ok.  I would like to see some major balance done on battleships and BLOPS to bring up their strength level.  Right now the Leshak feels waaay stronger than anything else.
---
i love this!!!!!!! can i buy it? im serious
---
Brisc is not a congressman.
---
Nobody cares
---
You got proof to the contrary?  None of us have any proof. But if youve been an active player for 15 years it is incredibly obvious that bots are far far worse now 
---
It's easy to just pay for tags nowadays - 500m ISK for -10 to 0 [https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/sectags/](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/sectags/)
---
There's literally no reason to fight for space from an income point of view. Just join an existing sov entity and obtain the resources that respawn indefinitely and in high magnitudes. Plenty to go around in a single region under a nice safe super cap umbrella.
---
Your title p much explains it all mate.
---
Alts and bots are not the same as input broadcasting alts either. 
---
Bots are without a doubt worse now, and I'd be willing to wager that the avg number of accounts per person has gone up, but such a conclusion is not aa obvious as the bottling problem 
---
I think you are missing the point.  The question isn't whether there is a benefit to meeting in person.  The question is whether having the community members pay for that benefit is justified.  
---
If you are the richest country in the world and a few hundred people are designated to run the lives of over 300 million, sure it can be worth paying for those individuals to meet in person when it is deemed necessary.  But we are a gaming community and times our tough.  One of our longest traditions (the AT) is being sacked for lack of resources.  
---
Try to imagine a scenario where your country has to choose between paying for congress to travel every week, or public schooling.  What do you think is best for the community as a whole?
---
Went through some old vids in my library and had some pretty decent footage from X-47. Tidi cancer blob fest that kill me client at the beginning of the fight but it looks pretty speed up to music 
---
An elected representative body is wrong?  What would be your solution to player representation with a company?  Mass hysteria on Reddit, whoever gets the most upvotes win?
---
I wonder how fast devs start applying to other companies when they read these stupid pleas of neckbeards begging them to change the game.
---
I dont know how... am nub prob spent 30 min trying to find it in settings and gave up
---
But that is just you. What about all the otehr CSMs from all over the world ? 
---
To give you some perspective on this, it costs me $2200 in off season just for a round trip ticket air fare alone in off season to go see half of my family. $2800 if its during summer or x-mas time. A ticket to Iceland would be just slightly less. And this is just the air trip.
---
I mean watching eve on stream is boring as fuck. I wouldn’t watch at either if I wasn’t playing in it. Training for it and playing in it is an awesome experience though. Countless hours of competitive and thrilling content with pressure, rivalry and goals. It also was very friendly for new teams. Two years ago there was like 70ish teams competing. So more than a thousand people involved, plenty of room to get into it. 
---
wow what amazing gameplay of the red dudes shooting beams at the blue dudes. what does that little red circle by the region name mean?
---
you seem upset jay. what's wrong, buddy?
---
I remember CCP in the past banning large amounts of bots. Have they stopped that? 
---
I truly appreciate your opinion and think it's great you could identify that, the loss of the AT doesn't affect you... 
---
If you're that sensitive about pink, you might want to work on hardening up your masculinity
---
https://www.soundboard.com/sb/EveAlert
---
Can you anchor mtus/depots in dead space pockets?
---
E: there's positive aspects of the game , and the loss of what is essentially to me just another organized LeagueOfLegendds game isnt the absolute downfall of the community.  
---
Thats all.       
---
See OPs post, along with a ton of other posts about it all over the place. No need to rehash what is already said yet again.
---
Wow is this from the once a year fight?
---
Very safe to put a 300b AT ship or a 100b flagship on the line for a match. Real risk averse play.
---
I've joined that rank too. 
---
I think you missed the joke about wanting hello kitty skins.
---
So the reps would save money too. Sounds like a win win situation.
---
Solo PvPers asked for a method to have a chance to deal with ECM, not for it to be completely fucked up and neutered. I was one of them so don't even try.
---
As for SOV fights, yea, thanks for reinforcing my point for me since these changes were basically made by null blobs for null krabs.
---
Blackjack and hookers?
---
yeah not gonna lie im pretty bad at this game, which is why my opinion is invalid.  
---
Been on and off player for 8.
---
And thats my point, you can't say its definitely worse, just that it seems worse. 
---
But it could be that the bots have gotten more brazen with few bans being dolled out.
---
I know 5 years ago we saw massives of 20 man mining fleets in highsec but i dont seem to see as many anymore.
---
It is. Not just unfriendly, its made right up to idiotic levels.
---
Again, the AT supporters don’t give a fuck that you feel that way.
---
Doesn't gsf tax mining by taxing refining? How is that not a valid way of tax?
---
More like, working out that most players PVP with 1 or 2 accounts but PVE/mine with 10 or 20 accounts.
---
A response arguing different viewpoints respectively and brainstorming.  Gasp
---
This is a good idea
---
CCP gave us shitty tools and ignored a ton of feedback from people. The changes they made allowed this mess to be created because they have not enabled us to react in good ways to it. They fucked up with Citadels.
---
What should I do? Sub 20 toons and feed the problem with rorqs? Should I invest in more skill injectors and field more supers to combat the super problem? Maybe become de facto Citadel maker so everyone can get cancer.
---
Man, if only we had a group of people as an in between CCP and players to communicate. Maybe some kind of council? But they'd probably fuck everything up too I bet 
---
lmfao
---
The type of content has changed drastically with changes such as:
---
Jump Fatigue
---
Moons
---
Faction Warfare
---
War Declarations
---
Not every player likes every form of content. When CCP changes the viable forms of content, the viable play strategies, it impacts who wants to keep playing the game, and who does not. Changes that make life easier for multiboxing rorquals disincentivize other forms of moneymaking, reducing activity in some areas of the game and restricting the type of hunting content available. Changes to war declarations positively impacted one playstyle at the direct expense of another, and a person who was wardeccing before would rather play a different game than run high-sec missions all day.
---
Ignoring that removing the AT (IE: removing a playstyle that many high-impact players focused their time on) while not providing alternatives as well as repeatedly nerfing the small-gang playstyle that many of those players ascribed to means that they're going to quit. They would rather play DOTA or some other game than sit in rorquals or an F1 fleet.
---
Recognizing too that small gang fighting is an important part of keeping the game a diverse landscape with a lot of depth, something that keeps the sandbox full of sand. Never mind that small gang is critical to developing personal pilot skill in a way that can't be done on a large fleet.
---
Thank you, i will try. 
---
Easy to say when your bloc has a majority of electors, and nullblocs in general have a huge majority.
---
fun fact innominate told CCP that rorq excavators were way too good before they were released
---
I have not..
---
It's basically a voluntary tax. We can't actually stop people from shipping ore to Jita or to some foreign refinery if they really wanted to.
---
Bots are pretty hard to fight these days when half of them are alpha accounts.  Ccp bans hundred fw bots. They're back in a few hours cause it doesn't cost any money 
---
You sir... are a nice guy.
---
I'm simply highlighting it's ineffectiveness. I know most of that was disagreed with, but ccp doesn't give a flying fuck. 
---
If CSM is so good, how come the game is shit now?
---
The AT is being dropped for a year because CCP doesn't have the Dev bandwidth to handle it in a year where they are doing eight different major fan events around the world with a greater level of direct CCP involvement than in the past for many of them. It's not a question of money, it's a question of time and bodies. 
---
Most gaming companies spend considerably on community development and community teams, and EVE isn't the only one that has had player representative meets with the developers. I did that in Star Wars Galaxies as a player rep 15 years ago. The cost is relatively small compared the benefit they get and the PR boost is gives them to have it. 
---
My wife is a senior public relations executive for one of the biggest PR companies in the world - she used to do a lot of research and focus groups, and they cost a shitload of time and money for clients to do. CCP gets the equivalent of a focus group of existing players every week, plus 24/7 access to folks, and a week long focus group twice a year for peanuts - it would cost them what one summit costs PER MONTH to get even the bare minimum from a market research group.
---
CCP's a for profit company. If they thought this was a waste of money, it would have been shitcanned a while ago. 
---
I was just thinking about this the other day. CSM, and specifically the CSM election process has been a failure. CSM was intended to represent the players, but what we have today is a group of people who represent only the leadership of their respective nullsec alliance. NDA violations have been so blatant throughout the years, they're not even trying to keep them under wraps anymore.
---
I'm not for removing the CSM, but election reform is long overdue. Example of a solution would be splitting it up into interest categories, with each player only getting one vote for the seat they care the most about.

They're already fucking you and have been for a long time. You just don't realize it.
---
Quit.
---
Everybody seems to think I'm a Congressman. Weird. 
---
I hope they dont quit the game over it.
---
Why can't CSM be done on skype tho?
---
bob bless your soul
---
Just reload the 2017 gala. I had an awesome time doing that
---
Remove OP, idea quality would automatically improve.
---
The is in a valentine‘s day theme but PLEX prices are still like in the screenshot of normal prices...
---
if you read carefully, he also says they could remain untouched if the other issues were resolved though.
---
So they are the sole source of Twitch content? What a moron.
---
That's why I have people like you around to do the little people work of reminding them how great I am. You do ok for being a fanboi.
---
It's querns, just downvote and move along.
---
And blow
---
Yes

That's hot.

---
there's a lot of people in Half Empty / Zero Fun Allowed that were in PIZZA, but the style of game play is very different
---
its really prediscount, fools served first :) true sale wll be after that :) they know what they are doing
---
Ha you are in for a surprise then.  
---
This is what Kickstarters are for.
---
That is very nice. Just out of sheer curiosity I have to ask though, why Veles over a T2 ? Specific reasons or just don't have the skill high enough yet ? 
---
T2 gives you much more ammo choices and ultimately much more burst DPS over Veles by far, but if I remember correctly Veles is easier on fitting and cap use (maybe wrong though, not in game to double check right now).
---
So any specifics ?
---
People also shitposted on reddit.
---
It works like a normal scram, just with a very large number of points.  (IIRC, it's something like 99 points while a regular scram is 2 and a disruptor is 1).
---
The script that turns the HIC bubble into a scram greatly limits its range.  You may have gotten out of that range.
---
i don't care
---
Ahh ty 
---
Sorry, I assumed you are using the Eve on Linux with precompiled wine provided by CCP Snorlax. Is that the case? If not I'd say your best bet is to try using the windows binaries in something like Lutris.
---
You have to work through all the implications and results of your tweaks.  For example, the fact that HICs had extremely low mass with their bubbles on was not intended, and caused unexpected results with an oversized prop.
---
Constantly tweaking numbers also makes your players upset.  Because they just skilled into and bought a HIC because of that feature, and you just nerfed it.  Generally, players prefer far more stability in their games.
---
Yeah cause where are they gonna find content lol
---
They need an alternate server. Clean and clear. Move a Tranq toon over and start at 500k sp. No going back. Start in a rando hisec system. No injectors. Just good old Eve Online skilling over time.
---
I'd pay $50 just for access, then my sub.
---
I bet the majority of players would move over.
---
So, exactly how the game has run for 10 years? While the magnitude of intake has changed, the availability of resources has not.
---
I have done the Installing EVE on Linux guide.
---
I want to do this now. Awesome guide. Thank you.
---
&gt;Eve's 'Valentine' launcher page from ~~12~~ when Eve was good years ago...
---
I was probing stuff in Ikuchi when I noticed there was a guy that was obviously running abyssal sites in a Hawk relatively close to the citadel he had his filaments in, but didn't create a probeable abyssal trace while doing so.
---
The third time he did that I was able to probe his ship while he was preparing his filament and could warp to where he was doing sites from.
---
There, I noticed that he did create an abyssal trace in space, you just could not find it with probes... See in the screenshot how I'm right on top of the trace, yet I only get an unrelated trace made by some guy in a Gila 0.26 AU away.
---
Is there an official way to do this?
---
On cheating, you could require all members of the team to stream themselves on something like Twitch....though the cheaters will just claim "There's something wrong with twitch".
---
Bonus points because you don't actually have to unsub, so you can make a lot of noise again in future!
---
Then eat whale dick instead.
---
More like terrible. Cause now any Rorq pilot can fire of a cyno, then wait for the shield to go down, then pop PANIC and refill shield. All the while, the super umbrella is gathering up for the rescue and the attackers can do nothing to stop the chain of events. No risk, max profit. Or so we think.
---
I played from 2008 to 2013. After that eve moved from a game, to a way for CCP to grab all the money.
---
The AT is like niche events at the olympics.  People spend a lot of time and effort preparing for an event that most people don't really care about, but for the participants and the small group of admirers, it is everything.  
---
I won't miss it, but I also feel that it was a good thing that made a bunch of pilots happy.  
---
&gt; You're deliberately missing the fact that it's a game where people actively want to kill each other. For them, the economy is a means to an end to achieve that goal, whereas your original statement (that capitalism is a destructive system) holds that violence is a means to achieve the goal of gaining wealth.
---
&gt; And you still haven't demonstrated any examples that capitalism is unsustainable and destructive (through Eve).
---
lmfao 
---
ok i'll tell u the truth
---
Guard wanted me to work for him on the ccp twitch channel for 8-16h per month for 500 plex *(and i did for 3 months from the goodness of my heart)*
---
wonder if he would make the same job offer to his son
---
&gt; The blue donut and ccp killed it.the sandbox is a lie.
---
You had me in the first half that you are a human. Well played.
---
Lol, I guess you didn't read Tips'nTricks, #2 clearly says - don't do it! 
---
But yeah, I guess I would totally do it again! :)
---
Unfortunately domis are kinda meh right now 😥
---
I mean, you actually do work in Washington lol.
---
I too endorse the movement to keep occupied the idea givers and suggestors somewhere else than here.
---
Like throwing a hotdog down the hallway
---
True. 
---
Done
---
Who told you we still do ? We're on reddit aren't we ? Well, that is not entirely true, we just let all our accounts go into alpha state and log in once in a while for something good. I actually enjoyed events until they fucked them up so badly and incredibly and would usually get a 3 month sub at a time to do other shit in the game too after they were over. Now I don't even feel like wasting plex on it.
---
Secretly, I agree. Don't tell anyone. I think we should replace AT with 15 on 15 capital fights.
---
What you should you do? 
---
I don't know, bro. What do you like to do? 
---
Play the game. Have fun. If you aren't having fun, play something else. 
---
Happy cake day, by the way. 
---
He probably means to say "why is pve better than PvP" or something like that, maybe he means to comment on the isk difference and that pve earns more or something.
---
Because the eve economy is fucking retarded
---
F2P is all about a fraction of your playerbase spending crazy amounts of money. You not spending money doesn't even move the needle if you're enabling whale behavior by farming their isk.
---
Yeah but when somebody tells you not to do something.... :D
---
And you don't see a problem with that?!
---
1. Stop telling CCP what they are doing is correct. You do this by stop playing their game. They only listen to their bottom line.
---
2. Its a longshot, but make your own game. CCP started with just a handful of devs. I have a feeling a new game that will shutdown eve for good is just around the corner.
---
Best post on this Reddit in months.
---
In that case, do you want to buy some 4 million units of industrial fibers I have laying around at 30k a unit? I keep trying to sell get at this price but I can’t seem to find the demand anywhere. 
---
* Their material costs may be lower than yours.  For example, mined in null, refined in a T2 refinery, assembled in a T2 EC from a 10/20 blueprint.
---
   * If you're talking about T2 or T3 things, do not price them by buying the components on the market.  Almost all T2/3 manufacturers build the components themselves, leaving a very thin and weirdly-priced component market.
---
* Some people think "I mined it so they're free!!"
---
* Some people are selling ships they no longer use, so any ISK is better than a hull sitting in a hangar.
---
* Sometimes demand will outstrip supply for a while and drive the price up, lots of manufacturers pounce and suddenly supply outstrips demand.
---
* Sometimes manufacturers in null try making something new to stock in their staging.  And if it doesn't sell out there we dump it in Jita for whatever we can get.
---
* Somebody may be doing a pump-n-dump or similar market shenanigans.
---
What range? Your sensors are too damp boi💦💦
---
It is a good thing, those plex were bought at a higher price than the sub would've cost. Someone else footing the bill makes no difference, all revenue goes to CCP.
---
i love eve for risk, and awful consequences. 
---
More and more of what I enjoy is going, and even though the AT viewership is a joke I do love it as part of the game.
---
it has been the final straw, automatic payment for dr1 through 6 has been cancelled.

PLEX is on sale now for 110% normal price. Better stock up!
---
There's more going on than "you using Plex to sub means whales pay $$$ to CCP." The fact that "the needle" doesn't show a change until players quit doesn't matter.
---
Aaaaaaaand nobody cares. Drama posts are for 12 year old girls on Facebook. Unsub and stfu about it
---
fuck that move to wormholes
---
only place not ruined entirely by ccp and null krabs 
---
funny how it doesn't have local too
---
Oh well. Drone ships were glorious back in the day. :) Nosferatu-Domi was OP as heck. They nerfed that pretty hard though.
---
Megathron and Hyperion still good?
---
my boy wheniaminspace checked out of EVE because of CCP a long time ago
---
i won't speak for him, but i know it was not because of anything in particular to do with the game itself, more the complete lack of faith in CCP
---
in short, he was of the opinion CCP have done nothing to earn your subscription in the past 5 years (it was more like 1-2 when he quit) and do not deserve anything even close to the success they are still enjoying off the back of a game they inherited
---
*Finally, I can have your stuff. 
---
Holy shit I just rushed and bought 0 plex at this amazing discount!
---
Imagine typing sounds of the loot box with a straight face. 
---
Now it just has PLEX sales...
---
And every time those new mechanics are introduced, the existing groups incorporated that changes and new content happened. That's the entire point - changes don't make the game, and they don't create the content. The players interacting with each other inside the confines of the existing mechanics does that. 
---
Yes, new mechanics let players do new things or do old things differently. But that's not CCP creating content. The players are still doing it. 
---
Changes that make life easier for multiboxing rorquals have zero impact on somebody else doing something differently to make money. Sure, it's easier to mine doing that, but there's also downsides and investment to it.  And just because somebody else can make money faster doing something you don't like to do doesn't mean that you can't keep doing what you like to do to make money instead.
---
The changes to war decs didn't remove them, and the list time I checked, PIRAT, Marmite, Code and the rest of those guys are all out war deccing and ganking and having a jolly old time, even with the changes. 
---
The AT is taking a break for a year, it's not being removed permanently. I've already had half a dozen people approach me with ideas for player run tournaments, so folks who want the tournament lifestyle are still going to have opportunities to do that, and there's still small gang PvP to be found. 
---
Yes, it sucks they're not doing the AT this year. But I'm still going back to my original point that folks crying that CCP needs to give them a reason to play are fundamentally missing the point of the game. 
---
Yes, it seems like the game is packed with microtransactions these days. The industry as a whole has just shifted that way.
---
Nope; those aren't P4s, and are thus useless for making structures. Cook em up some more first.
---
I meant safe from outside interference being warped to an inaccessible location by ccp, outside the sandbox.
---
And glad you mentioned the 300b AT ships... how ccp hands out 100 of them to the winners.  30 trillion worth of shit handed out to the top 4 teams, is stupidly excessive.    The winning team, assuming a couple guys aren’t hoarding it all, each member walks out with 1.5 trillion worth, which is more than most people will make in a lifetime of playing.   
---
You’ll have a hard time finding people sympathetic to those people looking for another massive hoard of wealth.
---
You're making my point.    
---
Dev bandwidth was slashed for financial reasons.  The purpose of saving on travel costs is to be able to allocate those savings somewhere else.  Like towards the Dev bandwidth which you admit is lacking.   
---
Your wife works for some of the richest companies in the world, in a field where getting it wrong just isn't an option.  No offense to you, but you and the rest of the CSM are not to CCP what your jet set wife is to her clients.  
---
I am not saying that the CSM should be shitcanned.  I am saying that if you have limited resources, rather than shitcanning something as precious as the AT, cut on the CSM travel costs.  
---
50000 PLEX  and CCP will remove the monument
---
Who's to say? My statement didn't cast it as a problem or as not a problem. My only point is to point out the curiosity of it somehow only now being noteworthy.
---
Delve is full of Bots =P
---
It has been noteworthy since that place guy was using battle rorqs.  Don't act like you were just doing a public service.  Of I am not being flair rused,byou goons know exactly what is wrong with rorq plus citadels.  CCP should change the name of the game to PVE.
---
I have installed Wine.. now the game start for 1 sec, black screen and exit
---
No amount of election reform is going to change anything. The system has been reformed like 4 times already.
---
Most people that play EVE aren't members of null sec blocs.  It's not the bloc players faults that the vast majority of active EVE Online players can't be arsed to spend 3 minutes once a year voting for their pick of CSM candidates.  CCP has tried advertising the CSM in game, pop ups and other means but none of it works, most players just don't care.
---
Your issue is with the players, not the voting system.
---
good luck persuading a flock of sheep to not buy PLEX for their shiny ship skins...
---
You are a hero of the people
---
who actually speaks like this
---
I love esports, but I too am gay and care nothing whatsoever for the AT
---
Should CCP make balance changes to promote quality content?
---
If your answer is yes, then you agree with me. Also, you have no proof that groups have shifted instead of not playing, being replaced by different players who prefer different forms of content.
---
TL;DR you're not alone but also running alts to pull this off
---
Alone it would not do much, but coupled with other stuff and cumulative total sum of effects over time are a different story. It would be a small step, but a step nonetheless.
---
Already replaced. 
---
&gt; he was of the opinion CCP have done nothing to earn your subscription in the past 5 years
---
That sounds right.

http://i.imgur.com/m9W2Djv.png

I'm sure the situation would looks infinitely more dire if one were to do the same for 2017 and 2018. 
---
Best. Title. Ever.
---
O7
---
No. Obviously, you don't understand. If you roam in hostile space with 10 assault frigs lets say. They should come and counter you with subcaps as well. This is what is called content for both sides. A fight. This leads to imagination and ideas. when both sides fight a close battle. But if you roam with a frigate gang of 10 and they drop avatar's on your ass on every gate then there is not much imagination going on, is it? This leads to stale from all side. Similar to what we see now in eve. All factions have empires and it's almost impossible for a new growing force of let's say 50 ppl to be competitive. I can't call it late start. It's game over for them. I was in Triumvirate until recent. And when we left Insmother we still have some cap force, 50-60 strong fleets, some scattered supers, and titans. And we simply could not punch a hole into nullsec so we can rebuild. Everything is batphone and cyno and titans and supers and capitals. Bored superpowers have Ansiblex gates that can reach even further with their capitals within minutes with no fatigue. No one will invade anyone anymore here. The map we see now will be stagnant for years to come because of Capital proliferation and nullsec mechanics. Capitals haven't ruined only nullsec. Because of the cap application on subcaps they made lowsec a desert in content. So to answer your question again. No I don't expect to go in someone else's space and do anomalies while they are docked. I expect to get have a fight ofc and get kiled. But in a fun type of fight. But if you take 2-3h a day to probe wh's conexions only to land in a boson every time . You kinda start hateing the mechanics of that and unsub.  
---
yes
---
So the initiative is a feckless twat pet of test? Not sure if you were going for that or not. 
---
Nerf bounties for every player in system. Make Sov cost 100x more. Limit corp/alliance sizes. Limit blues. New Eden decree that no super-capital can be produced for a period of 3-6 months. 
---
There are no penalties for becoming one big blue bag of dicks. Penalize size and player density. 
---
a step that will affect the smaller groups rather then big ones. and migration towards big empires will still continue. EVE population has to spread. not to live all under safe borders. 
---
&gt; What do we do from here?
---
If you are only interested in eve for eve's sake - unsubscribe. I'm limping on because my closest friends still play but I have absolutely zero hope or optimism in CCP's ability to make the game as fun as it once was. The current playerbase is just too interested in defending and mining/ratting. 
---
Ever since Pearl Abyss decided to buy EvE online, CCP's goal has been less about making a good game and more about how can they squeeze as much money out of EvE before it gets sold. The problem is, we are transitioning from a group of people who want EvE to be a good game into a group of people who want to make more money.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Think of all the decisions and stuff CCP have added. Its all been focused on profitizing EvE in the short-run to make it a more attractive sale to Pearl Abyss. Skins get added because PLEX. AT, balance, get removed because its less money that has to be spent.
---
The real death will come after Pearl Abyss finishes the transaction and squeezes every last dollar out of EvE before it finally dies as subscriber count drops due to a lack of attention to the game by any development company.
---
I don't play anymore. Unsubbed 3 days ago. But that is not the point.  
---
Specifically on this sketch between 30 minutes to an hour I think
---
&gt; funny how you of all people say that "just kill it" is a defense against something. Weren't you the one claiming that killing an umbrella is no option? :D 
---
Wow almost like I was making a point about how bad your position was. You had a problem with your own answer when it affected you. You're a hypocrite.
---
&gt; Lol, "DOCK UP". See how you would make eve a less active game if you were in charge? :) 
---
Almost like how current mechanics make roaming less appealing due to the further favoritism for krabs.
---
&gt; Then again, why would you need to have krabs be more vulnerable to you without local? It's evident that a less safe space means less activity in general (where is your conclusion to the numbers btw?) and by all means, removing local will make space less safe. 
---
Limited local doesn't just affect krabs, it affects everyone. It's about increasing the "fog-of-war" and giving people less intel to work with increasing the likelihood of a clash. Now you get a general idea of what numbers an enemy has and just go home if you don't like the terms.
---
&gt; I loled. :) 
---
Not an argument.
---
&gt; Sure it does - the most active PvE region, the most active PvP region. It's evident for me. Since I still have no conclusion of your own, well, it's what I go with. Since you failed to adress my question for your conclusion about the numbers, well - there is no argument here. 
---
It's the "most active" because it's the most populated area. If those Goons were roaming instead of PvEing there would still be content.
---
&gt; No, I haven't. PvP'ers do every single second though. Where are all the attacks on structures? If PvP'ers wanted real PvP, they would try to force it by attacking the things they can always attack. 
---
Structure grinds are boring. "HURDUR these Huns aren't smashing their horse archers into my castle walls...they must not want to fight us huurrrrrrr"
---
&gt; Actions my friend, actions. What happens in the game (or rather: what doesn't happen) clearly show: you are lying about your side of the argument. Your words don't matter. PvP'ers, for the majority, want easy kills and thats fine really, if that's the prefered playstyle then so be it. 
---
This is what your spodbrain makes you think. You're a krab hervibore and in order to deal with the reality that you are weak and spineless, you make things up. "But if people don't grind my Keepstar they don't REALLY want pvp hurrrrr."
---
&gt; CCP gave them tools, they can't/don't want to afford them. More clear? 
---
What tools specifically favor attackers just like things like panic modules, citadels, alliance gates, toggle cyno jammers, favor defenders. Be specific.
---
&gt; Thanks for proving my point about not wanting to use adequate tools for the job. :) 
---
Thanks for proving my point that you're a spodbrain riddled retard.
---
&gt; It's what Elite PvE'ers do and it's the goal of removing local. Hunt more PvE'ers, remove the chance to escape for them with the only way of getting out being "ask for help". Just that in your case: "Claim the reason is aiming at more PvPer vs PvPer fights". Which is laughable as evident from the discussion. 
---
I don't care who I kill. You're meat. You're tiny little baby nuts just shriveled up at the idea that you won't have local telling you when to dock up your ship.
---
&gt; A crab that doesn't have the money to PvP beause it's more likely that he will get caught will krab less. That means he makes less money, that means he can afford less losses and it means he can go less on PvP fleets on his own. 
---
Uh don't be shit at pvp then? I don't krab and I have 50 bil liquid sitting around.
---
&gt;The result of that is: Less targets for you to kill. Less PvE means less PvP. Less safe PvE = less PvE = Less PvP.  
---
&gt;I am not sure how you can still ignore these simple truths about Eve Online.
---
Because pvpers go out to find fights regardless. Look at FW. Look at lowsec. People still go out to kill stuff.
---
They may have for some packages, but I just bought the same amount this morning that I always do. Same amount of plex, just 10% off. I think it may be just the small packages that arent getting free plex anymore, indicating that the problem isnt with CCP making good business decisions that you dont like, it's about you being poor. Stop being poor you guys.
---
what the fuck
---
Your art is amazing. And I'm sorry for you that due to the current situation people don't appreciate it more. Keep it UP!
---
See i can relate to this I guess, I like watching snowsports, which is frankly a fading draw for the public, its cool seeing people race superG, boardercross, slopestyle and pipe...but then at the end of the day....I get the same nasty taste in my mouth, its all about personalities and teams and all this stuff that just makes me feel like "fuck that bullshit I just wanna slay freshies and not deal with people"  
---
Funny enough, literally telling the wife the other day when Lindsey Vonn had her last race, "I hope she goes full granola in the backcountry and becomes the raddest soulskier ever"  
---
Same with eve, when the AT gods have their last match, I hope they still wanna derp fleets around and just take it eazy.  
---
I'm seeing things a bit differently. No mention of free (those numbers haven't changed though) and cut down prices. 
---
Secure.eveonline.com ?
---
All this! Also fuck local.
---
You coukd for the right price though I have strange plans to build up a few and use them as gifts, though details arent set in stone they may include corpies, eve berlin and instagram followers
---
&gt; CCP's a for profit company. If they thought this was a waste of money, it would have been shitcanned a while ago.
---
the only reason you guys didnt get shitcanned is because you are cheap PR and money. same goes for your nullsec hugbox btw. 
---
"docking permission de.. doc.. dock.. docki...do...docking permission, granted"
---
Again, there's more going on here than "someone is still paying RL money." Subs give CCP cash all at once even if someone then quits before the sub runs out. There's more "investment" to stick with the game if you pay for longer periods of omega at a time than just renewing 1 month at a time with plex when you want to play. You can let your account lapse for a week or two or eight inbetween plexing which means over a year CCP isn't actually getting $20/month/account from plexing. More plexing may or may not put plex prices at an equilibrium where CCP actually earns more money, depending on how the higher plex prices affect players who grind isk to sub vs. how they affect the number of plex bought so people can sell for isk. Etc.

Or has it taken 15 years to work out how to spot them?
---
&gt;I leave to your imagination how a smaller entity can defend against a bigger one if their super umbrella does nothing to stop an invasion.
---
Its actually a hell of a lot easier. Take stealth bombers and smartbombers just as an example. Won't wipe a cap/super fleet while being outnumbered, but sure as hell can wipe a sub cap fleet while being outnumbered **if or when** that fleet fucks up. Exactly and precisely as it should be, but isn't.
---
enjoy wrangling all those automized tards in your dead game lol. what are you even building empires for these days? 
---
Like throwing a sausage down a hallway.
---
Even after the 10% discount its still cheaper to buy the same amount of plex from Markee Dragon thanks to exchange rates for $ to Euro.
---
I think it speaks to the fact that they're having 7 mini-fanfests all around the world this year, which consumes a lot of dev time.
---
darn, you guys gonna disband then? dibs on greesnwarm
---
Why would any non-CCP employee make money for CCP and not get paid real money in return?
---
still too much tbh
---
Kill the krabs.  
---
And I don't mean EVERYONE that does any kind of pve is suddenly a krab. Krabs are spineless fuckwits who consider their grinding as some kind of virtue. And all of these points iterated above rather than being taken and considered intelligently are just evidence of "the pvper's salt." Our community has been inundated with a deluge of low IQ, highly entitled membership and every point made by the op is correct.

similar experience but in a c5, only for crabbing. 
---
Did 4 rattles + astrahaus to kill drifter with bubble.
---
Bought an astra. anchored.
---
Moved rattle pilots out, moved in dread pilots, got wandering lo/ns and moved in fit/hull nags.
---
PVE is fun in dreads. 
---
It costs almost nothing the Devs were mostly doing it in their spare time.
---
The reason it's not happening this year is not financial.  The only convention center in Iceland that can hold fanfest is being remodeled.  So, CCP decided to do 7 mini-fanfests around the world.  That consumes a lot more dev time, and something had to give.

Actually just read this and shut the fuck up.

That’s crazy talk.  If the best of the best all decided to quit the game what’s the worst that could happen?

lel look at this guy chestbeating about eve stuff like its 2011
---
Like I said - if we were too expensive and not worth anything, they'd have killed it a long time ago.

I'll take "What is lel for 500 Alex".

I unsubbed because of this post
---
My mistake
---
Hull warning is the best
---
prices are climbing so fast for plex at this point its starting to look like the supply is not increasing at the same rate, so while demand may be climbing it seems people are not buying it at the same rate.
---
You're still missing the point. 
---
OP said "give me reasons to play the game!" and I responded with you're doing it wrong if you need CCP to give you reasons to play.
---
I stand by that statement. 
---
Ummm, you kill marauder with frigates (5-10 of them depending players age, skill, etc) in 6-7 minutes flat as soon as its bastion drops. WTF game are you playing ? You must have never jumped any BSes (marauders included) while in frigate gang. Yea you migth lose some of them and probobly will, but even that is a maybe not a certainty. 
---
O and to boot, when you do lose some of the frigs they are like 20-30 mil losses, if that. 
---
Didn't even offer to throw in some ciggies? CCP such poors.
---
The CSM aren't consultants.  CCP does what they want, and the CSM gets a chance to comment.  It's up to CCP to decide if those comments should turn into changes or not.
---
Whoosh
---
Fun read, other than the fact that you seem to dock up, log off, or otherwise just hide any time you could PVP.
---
exactly. that´s what i just said. 
---
This would be an example of why r/eve would be a terrible replacement for the CSM.  The posters on r/eve don't understand the concept of an example.
---
It is a time problem.  But it's way easier to "solve" it if you pretend it's a financial problem.
---
They'd just make alt corps and build more fort.

No, I think I just have bad wifi. It was like that when I clicked on the page from the launcher.

Interns are probably the only employees CCP can afford with the tight budget PA gives them for EVE.
---
I also miss having UTC time displayed on the launcher. 
---
I think the problems people have with requests for ship balance changes are a really obvious symptom of this. Like, it's 6 months between each balance change and all you came up with was minor stat tweaks to 3 ships? I swear 'medium ACs suck' has been a gripe for like 3 years, the rate of progress is just absolutely glacial.
---
People keep telling me Eve is dead but no one is giving me their stuff. Is this a scam?
---
No.. that would not be the correct answer for "What is lel".
---
~~MILLION~~ Trillion dollar fight
---
Although I do think this could work, what you are talking about is getting CCP paid from advertising revenue while they do none of the work. CCP would just stream it on twitch and youtube and make 10- 20 thousand off the ads alone on both of those websites.  Im not really intrested in making CCP more money until they start doing more than just putting bandaids on major issues.  Im not just talking about the botting issue becuase I dont see a way for that to get fixed unless we take out F2P.  Im talking about the blantant issues that we are having with balancing, drifter wormholes, sov mechanics, and a whole host of other things that is too long to list.
---
This is a pearl abyss thing, they're really fucking bad at sales
---
In BDO they had a sale on a few items, but for some reason in order to have a sale on like, 8 items, ALL items were on sale but increased from their original price till it matched
---
Dumbest thing I've ever seen
---
Nah. It's just emergent gameplay is all.
---
k
---
Thinking that these limits actually prevent groups as organized as the coalitions from existing. External tools make it extremely easy to split people in an effective way to circumvent hardcaps. Real businesses do this with ERP and HR software, and EVE coalitions are about as organized as a medium sized business.
---
It will be a hilarious headline when the first EVE coalition buys an Epicor license to deal with efficient distribution of members to sub-alliances. The alliances big enough to overflow the hard cap but not big enough to have dedicated HR nerds will be the ones that have to downsize.
---
I'd suggest making friends and being likable. I've received plenty of stuff over the years
---
thank you.  I fully expected a can i have your stuff post and was not disappointed.
---
as my corpmates pointed out i probably missed like 15 different other ree worthy things but whatever 
---
What’s this about?
---
So down! This is the reason I have a corpse hanger!
---
EVE made just over 20 million in 2015, the 2016 numbers are a mess because CCP was playing games to make themselves look more valuable then they really are.  So assuming a similar outcome to 2015 every year pearl abyss would need to keep it running for at least 20+ years if they want to get their 425 million back they spent buying the company.
---
And then I kill them and incinerate everything precious?

---
Weebs out!
---
I'm not making your point. I'm disagreeing with your point directly. This isn't about money. The cost of the CSM is not enough to cover the cost of hiring a single Dev, even a community guy. 
---
They're doing different stuff this year, and taking a one year break. They'll do the AT in 2020, Falcon has already said as much. This is not a money issue.
---
The CSM is to CCP what the focus groups with consumers/influencers my wife runs for her clients are to her clients. That stuff costs way more than CCP spends on the CSM on a yearly basis.
---
The limited resources here isn't money - it's Dev time. They could shitcan the summit this year and still not have the bandwidth to do the AT. 
---
It's so far removed from why I play the game. I'm indifferent to it, I feel bad for those who enjoyed it so much though,
---
It's the tech and the dev's they want. They probably dont care about breaking even in the game. They have black desert as a cash cow as well to supplement income.
---
&gt;There are hundreds of great ideas here.
---
No, there are hundreds of ideas here from people who want to buff their particular activities and don't think their idea all the way through to the effects on the rest of the game.  Anyone who points out the bad consequences of their ideas gets downvoted to hell, and you're left with a group of people patting themselves on their backs for all their great ideas.
---
There's been maybe 5 good ideas in the last two years.
---
Game design's hard.  But &gt;90% of gamers mistakenly think it's easy.
---
&gt;You also think the csm doesn’t have shit ideas?
---
The thing is the CSM more-or-less doesn't get to have ideas.  They get to say things like "fozzieclaws suck" and that's about it.  They're primarily a sounding board for changes CCP wants to make.  Like pre-Rorq changes, the Goon CSMs warned CCP they were going to exploit the fuck out of Rorqs....and CCP went ahead anyway.
---
Sometimes, the CSM gets changes implemented (eg. no asset safety in wormholes).  Sometimes, they don't.
---
Oh, tough break again. No, sorry. The correct answer is "What is the current egdy mutation of LOL, or laughing outs loud, that is most commonly used by pretentious children and wannabe cool kids." Lead back to Sean Connery.
---
maybe pearl abyss brought the ccp employees instead then, game might be irrelevant 
---
cant see what they will make though  
---
Lol no.... they're so blatantly obvious now
---
Rorquals were OP like that in the past and everyone used them to mine? I missed that part somewhere.
---
Disappointed you did not come and find me again haha o7 
---
You seem to have a well thought out argument, so I will not troll, but your argument has several flaws.  Feel free to point out if I overgeneralize but your main points are:  
---
&gt;n+1 is strong  
---
&gt;structure spam hurts small scale conflicts  
---
&gt;offense vs defense rewards are off  
---
These all boil down into the same pot of:
---
&gt;I have less perceived content now
---
You have some very good points, mainly:  
---
&gt;Most posters advocate anti-enemy changes  
---
&gt;Changes have unintended consequences  
---
I want to hit on some specific points first:  
---
**Structure Safety** - This is a false argument.  You claim citadels provide perfect safety, but their safety level is similar to a PoS you had access too.  They prevent undock shenanigans ala stations, but otherwise are very similar to PoS, especially post Cyno-tether change.  
---
**Big Wars** - Name me 1 big war that was not involving some form of BoB and/or Goons (in b4 2006 era Russian stuff).  EvE wars are and will always be driven mostly by personalities rather than other metrics.  This also mirrors real life.  Sure the US could do invade china for its rare earth metals, but why?  They simply don't hate them enough.  
---
**My Content** - This is the major fallacy of all reddit posters these days.  I can tell by your post you joined post 2012.  You joined after an era where people already said eve was dead for the same reasons.  Your last paragraph telegraphs this succinctly.  The hunting power of a player in 2019 is at the higher power level it has ever been in the history of eve online.  You can catch and kill a player in less than 30s from entering a system, I have done it, anyone who is good has done it.  There is a saying about foxes and rabbits that resembles a system in balance.  If Hunting Power is at historic highs, then defense power must also be at historic highs.  In such a polarized state, we see the unorganized masses eating the brunt of the extremes.  Mid level gangs now face high power defense.  Mid level ratters now face high power attackers.  Both states force people into a super-org like Goons, or whatever pvp org you want to name.  Where this falls apart is that the 'offense' crew usually want to pew pew and somehow just 'make free isk' ala r64 towers, rental regions, IWI, AT Ships, etc.  You can see their bi-weekly CCPlz posts.  I also feel like the 'defense' crew is pretty smug right now, because this is the first time in a long time that gameplay has even been iterated on.  Or did you like station flipping?  It is my opinion that power-creep is killing the small-middle man.
---
**Whining without solutions** - This is you.  This is 90% of reddit.  What would fix your perceived slights?  Can you even articulate the core of the problem you think exists?
---
&gt;don't care about EVE for another ~18 months until AT 2020'.
---
CCP's release of their only consistent commitment to difficult pvp is painfully symbolic. Promises to return to it ring as empty as promises for iteration. Perhaps we'll see a 3v3 "AT" in abyssal space in 6 years when the only people playing are those that click every mod, own 6 rorquals and each supercarrier, and zoom their cameras all the way in so they can see the microdetails of their newest skin.  
---
&gt;(the tournament scene is basically the only thing about EVE in its current state that gets me going
---
For you and many others. I would describe this community as those interested in actually *trying* in this game in the tactical or game knowledge sense. Effort has shifted from rewarding individual knowledge and skill to the largest organizations and the last respite from the sheer mundanity of blobbing was the tournament scene. I'd guess that this is why you feel as you do but I cannot say for sure. 
---
No, then they quit and give you things.
---
Old boss of mine used to keep a pink .45 under the counter. Asked him why pink, and he told me that if they're still alive by the time the police got there, they'd have a nice story in jail to tell of being shot by a pink gun.
---
Sad part is....r/EVE is a better game than EVE. 
---
plex used to be 595m at one point
---
Target lock noise gets be every time when watching someone's videos.
---
Just have Hydra FC for the monument...
---
did they kill the supercapitals? or just the Keep. Big fucking difference.
---
&gt;High income. In short, you need to be doing well on the Monthly Economic Report, because to have the biggest empire, you need to build titans to win the TiDi slugfests;
---
This is the issue I focus on a lot, because it's what really drives sov entities to emphasize krabbing over all other playstyles. Titan+fax blobs are unique in that they can only be countered by more titans (every other shiptype can be countered by bigger, smaller or different ships). This also prevents alliances from risking their titans, because losing them would make them fall behind in the titan race. Titan numbers are the most important metric of a sov alliance in New Eden right now (because nothing else matters in a titan brawl, except the fax fleet); everything you do is geared around building more and more titans. 
---
A corollary here is that if you show up to someone's space without a titan blob, they'll turbodank you with their titan blob (see: goon Hakonen deployment) and laugh at you on reddit. So you best just stay home. 
---
**Tl;dr Titans are the only ship that matters, so this is all just a race to see who can get more. Rorqs and injectors and shit let you run faster, but it's the same treadmill we've been on since ~2010.**
---
^that ^said ^please ^buff ^blops

Hi capqu &lt;3

This isn't about rorquals.

24 Hour for Omega would be cool and would probabaly boost subscribers, but what about 24 hours with no Concord. Turn New Eden into one massive Warzone.
---
Yeah he needs a nerf

Great post. I've considered the wormhole life, but haven't made a move yet.
---
I don't really care about the AT either, but I also view it as yet another way of CCP saying that the don't give two fucks about the game or their players beyond the money it puts in their pockets.
---
&gt;Structure Safety - This is a false argument. You claim citadels provide perfect safety, but their safety level is similar to a PoS you had access too. They prevent undock shenanigans ala stations, but otherwise are very similar to PoS, especially post Cyno-tether change.
---
The citadel combines the luxuries of a station with the ubiquity and near absolute safety of POSes. Consider the average regional roaming gang - previously they could harass an entity for a fight by camping their undock and needling the locals for a response. Now, this is impossible. As you say it is a decline in content patched entirely out of the game. 
---
&gt;Big Wars - Name me 1 big war that was not involving some form of BoB and/or Goons (in b4 2006 era Russian stuff). EvE wars are and will always be driven mostly by personalities rather than other metrics. This also mirrors real life. Sure the US could do invade china for its rare earth metals, but why? They simply don't hate them enough.
---
The argument isn't that a lack of personality is involved. It's rather the opposite - it's effectively the only reason. The actual issue I'm attempting to convey is the meaninglessness of loss and the subsequent meaninglessness of war. The North lost several keepstars and enough titans that I don't even remember the entire tally? What was the consequence? Wealth is so widespread that there is no meaningful loss and no meaningful consequence to war. Even the most recent highsec skirmishes have been over a perceived form of *more income* in a game characterized by trillions of isk generated each month.

This was almost not worth replying to as it does so little to address my actual post. I have played from 2008 - 2010 and then from 2012-present. There have been no buffs to offense (outside of sheer numerical swarming) for the last 4-5 years to warrant the sheer amount of buffs for defending and conflict denial.

This is a premium example of advocating for change to hurt another playstyle irreparably. The manner in which your post is written indicates you agree with the sentiment presented and  many of those things listed have nothing to do with one another but have been lumped together as.....a means of sweeping them away? I'm not entirely sure. 
---
&gt;Whining without solutions - This is you. This is 90% of reddit. What would fix your perceived slights? Can you even articulate the core of the problem you think exists?
---
There is no solution. The game has shifted paradigmatically to the point that there is little to no place for players that enjoy pvp, like me. 
---
Also, both the HIC point and HIC scram have the same debuff icon, so there's no way to tell whether you're pointed or scrammed unless you try to turn on your MWD. 
---
Well without Panic, and a nerf to Capital application to Subcaps...  
---
I see blops fleets seeing an uptick. A gang of blops BS/Cruisers could wreck a Rorqs shit if they didnt have Panic, and if the Capital Umbrella response fleet was effectively "useless" then they couldn't come along...especially if Cyno Inhibs actually shut down active Cynos.  
---
Meaning only way Mr. Rorq is getting saved...is if a response fleet burns to him. 
---
Hilmar did nothing wrong
---
Everyone always at CCP for not throughly finishing or thinking things out. Like every.single.patch.
---
So they listen, and not do something rushed.....and this is the response. JESUS you all are whiney ungrateful gamers.
---
It's not that at all. /u/RadiumShady is correct in that making balance *changes* largely comes down to tweaking numbers, which is no work at all. The issue and the reason this happens so rarely is that in order to make those changes, someone first needs to make balance *decisions*. That's 99% of the process, and it's by no means an easy task. Changing something even by a little may have far reaching implications for the meta down the line - implications that won't even get figured out for months. So as a developer, you have to 
---
a) know what is actually unbalanced (even though half of reddit might be screaming about this or that doesn't mean they're correct
---
b) know how to balance them
---
c) predict the consequences of these changes for the entire game
---
Remember when a CCP dev was going to go through the entire tutorial from fresh on stream?  That didn't last long.
---
That is exactly what should happen. Especially now with Ansiblex Gates. You can connect the region like never before. But i understand your point. Rorquals need to be stopped anyway. Even if it's way to late. Why don't they do mining sites as DED plexes. With special gates that allows subcaps only and Rorquals. This way they cannot be cyno'ed on top of them with hostile caps. But they also cannot light a cyno to be rescued by FAX and titans. They would have to battle trough it. And that is awsome. That is content!
---
Yep, the hint was when they said the reason to buy the company was to use their experience to build a one server game. They just want a massive single server game they can milk for years.
---
Damn people investing months of their time often over the course of several years and working hard as a team to become the best in the game at something actually getting a meaningful reward. Absolutely shocking.
---
....this may be a dumb question, but at those skins really pink? I am red-green colorblind, and thought it was just a light grey. 
---
Meh. Hold out for 25%. 
---
More new SKINS in 3...2...1...
---
Hopefully this time CCP gives us their SKIN flute!
---
The amount of ISK that is being taken out of the economy from this event is astronomically tiny compared to the amount that is generated every day. ISK sinks are great, but that doesn't justify a boring, worthless event.
---
You could replace "Guardian's Gala" with any of the last 5 or so events in the title and it would be just as true.  CCPA just don't give a fuck anymore.
---
I found this really really interesting. I haven't played in a few years but I was just getting into exploration in null when I quit.  I had always been a huge care bear and it was like too much anxiety for me lol. It's the only thing I'd consider coming back for and a solo play-style. Respect.

Thanks Pornhub, now I look like raw hamburger.

---
&gt; First off local chat was a major complaint by the community for a while when it was broken. So I don't see how 2 dev blogs about it is a bad thing. Unless you're complain that they need to do more beyond those topics? The community complained about something and CCP fixed it and communicated about it. 
---
Its not the 2 dev blogs on their own, its that there have been consistent dev blogs that have not been about gameplay or balance changes, often reiterating on things the first dev blog already mentioned (in the case of security updates). Then we had updates about an activity tracker. I get it, its a new thing that they want to explain, but again, its not anything that changes balance issues. The 2nd chat devblog was arguably the one they should have started with, whereas the first was the typical "we're looking into it". The 2nd one gave a timeline on what they plan on doing and what will happen if they can't fix it. I'm perfectly fine with that, but again, its not about game balance.
---
Depending on who you are around, not everyone was complaining about the chat issue. Don't get me wrong, i know its important from a game development perspective to have working chat and makes them look terrible not to have a working chat/local. But i'd say there were still quite number of people in the "community" who were happy when chat broke. As they could actually hunt with being reported by Near2. I'm not advocating that chat should stay broken, just saying, not everyone was mad and complaining when it did break.
---
&gt; I can see the complaint of fighter application 1 tapping frigs and such but I can tell you that the last part of your statement is not true. I have been on multiple 10-20 Kiki 1mn fleets that have held grid with multiple supers... No application issues. The ships are not more than 300mil-400mil. I don't think solo pvper's should be able to hold grid with a super. 
---
To clarify a point, i did not indicate supers. To remain on grid with even regular carriers require specialized fits or logi. Some of which can be much more expensive than the ships they're trying to kill. 
---
10-20 kiki's at your quoted price is anywhere from 3B to 6B. You're putting more isk on field than what is you're trying to kill if you're after a carrier or dread. Obviously that doesn't apply if you're fighting supers. 
---
I also never said anything about a super being solo'd or that a solo pvper should be able to hold grid with a super. But i'd also not want supers be the best ship to bring when you're going against subcaps either.  
---
I'm a firm believer that carriers and supercarriers need more fitting sacrifices. Balance can be acheived by doing a mild application nerf and then making carrier/supercarrier pilots make fitting decisions.
---
Such as, remove the NSA and then if you want to lock 500% faster, use 3+ SEBO's like a battleship has to do, or use info links+SEBOs. Or if you want your fighters to apply well, you'll need at least 2 or 3 tracking comps (but then lose mids for SEBO's). There are other examples, but i'll leave it at that. I don't want to neuter carriers, but there is a hell of a lot of room for adjustment to find a proper balance here either through fitting, module choice plus some massaging of fighter application.
---
&gt;This contradicts your earlier statement. If every larger ship is supposed to counter lower ships (broad generalization) then what do carriers counter? Other carriers? You've asked for the removal of fighter application. You have dreds/supers to bash with so now what do carriers do? The point is that carriers are meant to counter sub caps. That is their roll. Maybe they're only supposed to counter cruisers up?  
---
&gt;Also I do not think that a single saber/hic should be able to indefinitely point a properly fit capital (maybe we can argue carriers and dreds but definitely not supers). Thats just OP to know the second you see a saber/hictor on you unless you get friends to save you your supers dead or at the mercy of the single tacklers bordum. You should be able to fight back if properly fit and shed tackle to some degree.
---
Again, to clarify, i never said to remove fighter application, but it needs to be nerfed to some degree, that doesn't mean 100%, or 90%. It could mean 30% or 15%. Currently, fighters with 2 omni-directional tracking computers (tracking scripted) apply very closely to fury light missiles. Bumping that up with the same tracking computers to fury heavy missile application would be a lot better.
---
Carriers can still counter subcaps, the goal here is that you can't just bring 5-10 carriers and counter every subcap. The carrier should be supported by other subcaps to get its full application. Such as, bring a huginn or additional webs/target painters to support the carrier. A carrier should not be able to easily track interceptors, frigates and even some cruisers. It should be able to apply easily to battlecruisers and battleships though.
---
Also, a larger ship will be stronger than a ship smaller than it, but that doesn't mean the smaller ship should be utterly defenseless against it either, which is the case for a vast majority of battleships. Except things like nightmares, leshaks and machariels (kind of). You see this relationship in things like frigates/assault frigates/navy frigates where they can go toe to toe with some larger ships and either remain on grid and ignore them, or actually fight and kill them if setup for it. You don't see that same relationship in things like a battleship vs carrier. Should it exist? Maybe, maybe not, but it exists in every other ship interaction, just not with the vast majority of subcaps vs capitals.
---
Going back to the original point of HAW Titans. A Titan is the largest ship in EVE. It really has no business shooting at subcaps. It should be something that is supported by other capitals and subcaps. It should be an excellent weapons platform against other capitals and supers especially. But it should not be YOLO'ing around and trying to shoot at subcaps or clear tackle in a Titan. That is the job of subcaps. If you want to YOLO around and doomday a rorq, i'm cool with that.
---
I brought up the battlecruiser comparison because that same principle already applies. Battlecruisers have no business shooting at frigates and no battlecruiser is damage bonused at rapid light missile launchers. They are 2 "sizes" larger than a frigate. A Titan is 3 "sizes" larger than a battleship (2 if you combine carriers and dreads into the same class/sizing).
---
Keep in mind, i already admitted that HAW Titans are not that OP, its more the principle of the matter that they should not be able to fit HAW guns. HAW dreads i feel are perfectly fine/balanced and i have no issue with them.
---
&gt; This seem slightly over powered but I agree that cyno inhibs should get a boost. Increase the resistance, shorter online time, and it decycles the cyno. I don't think it should turn off the cyno instantly. Maybe it reduces all cynos by 10 seconds every second (shortens the cyno time left)? IDK but I agree there should be a tweek. 
---
Depending on if capital/carrier application is adjusted, i can look past the cyno spool up, or cyno issues in general. But in combination with instant, nearly perfect application that can be cyno'd in to support anything in a huge area, its very oppressive and leaves only a very small window for you to work with to actually engage what you want. So it would really be dependent on how CCP address the first issue before we can tackle the 2nd issue (cynos).
---
Having it cycle down the cyno time limit quicker before shut off is an interesting idea. But, when its 5min to cycle and everyone has a supercap fleet on standby waiting to drop on anything, instantly. It wouldn't be super effective at actually preventing instant cyno support. Still a neat idea though, maybe something that can be looked into later.

A good chunk of this problem is there's not enough players to populate the space most null-blocs have.  Everyone's got plenty of Anoms to farm so there's no need to go take someone else's.  If the player-base was much larger, there'd be more fighting.  
---
I was kinda hoping the recent patch that nerf anom respawn rates would help with this, push alliances out of the 'denser is better' meta. I don't think that's the case however. 
---
I see you forgot option (c) both.  
---
Well if you look at it from a "gameplay metrics" standpoint...   CCP is likely to see all these miners and ratters with high play times and hitting "engagement" goal metrics (per the social media type of wasting time and giving eyes).   While PvPers are likely to have much lighter play hours in comparison.
---
Simple fix to a lot of issues with super umbrellas that I've seen suggested before.. make resources and anoms less abundant and more spread out.. if a large group wants to have enough supplys make it so they need a lot more space.. the more spread out the easier it is to have meaningful content on a scale more obtainable to smaller groups.

&gt; why is every discussion a mindless circlejerk dominated by a single opinion?

welcome to reddit?

It's about a confused game studio and its continuous attempts at ruining the only successful product in their line-up
---
A couple of hours pass from the latest report and Semiki is on fire. A large force of invading Drifters reinforces a number of local citadels in a massive attack, taking down CONCORD forces and Ishukone Watch standing fleet.
---
CONCORD officers Oveg Drust and Lorienne Nesif come through the system to scan one of the few successfully defended by CONCORD citadels and take off as soon as capsuleers start questioning their acts.
---
However this will end? Less than 23 hours till the citadels come out of reinforcement.
---
Of course goons are aware of how op rorqs are. We can offer up the example of how op they are on a silver platter to ccp but they're not going to do anything about it. Don't blame goons for taking advantage of an opportunity
---
making something an isk sink is not the same as making it a complete waste of time. If the payout was some kind of limited time available, untradeable items/skins that can never be earned again and can't be sold on the market no one would care it was an isk sink.
---
Not quite the galaxy pack sales of old.
---
Are Drifters actually destroying Concord ships? Keep up the great work with these videos.
---
Ols eve magic .. you mean the stuff that was done by all the people they kicked in the last 15 years, leaving only a husk of their former self?
---
Proud to be quoted in a brilliant post. I love this game but the direction CCP keeps pushing the game in -- more casual, more forgiving, less content generation and finesse play -- really bothers me. If I didn't have a lot of friends who play I'd probably have stopped long ago.

Whiney Bitch

&gt; No, there are hundreds of ideas here from people who want to buff their particular activities...blabla

that´s a long ass way to say CSM

Same reason we always have: because we can. Empires are fun!

You're not alone.  I have no great love for the AT.  As I said in another thread somewhere, it's like playing the Superbowl on a basketball court.

I do feel bad for my friends that LOVE the AT.  I know it means a lot to them.

This much is 100%.

I mean its been 10 years, where the fuck are my shipmodels? Merch Store? Movies ? posters? ffs.....

Ive got 4 shirts from them, because i BRIEFLY caught them selling merch one day. Just once...   
---
There are decisions CCP makes that dont make a lick of sense to me businesswise,  full disclosure My company is a vendor for CCP....and I have had conversations with our account rep about increasing our relationship...and the rep laughs at me "these guys dont get it" that is feedback from behind the scenes, an increased relationship with us would literally make lives better for the rest of you.   
---
They wont do it.   
---
Wait, whut? Is Eve ded _again_?
---
Oh, Tri. Nevermind.
---
Would you like some big group to really get an itch and come to roflstomp Tri? Would that give you the content you crave? When you lose are you going to blame it on CCP enabling assholes that can organize well under the current meta? 
---
Doesn't matter what the meta is. Losers gonna lose; winners gonna win. Boo those nasty people that don't play the game the way I want to.
---

---
I lived solo in a WH a few years ago for about a month and a half out of a cloaky orca. In an occupied WH !!!!! LOL 
---
The thing that would have to change for me to return to WH is the complete removal of necessity to scan for everything everywhere and the necessity to keep hitting d-scan to the point that it causes carpal syndrome. Quite literally and for real.
---
Do this, and the WHs will get a ton of people guaranteed, and my personal once in a while daytrips will extend quite a lot too.
---
What are you talking about? My point is that the core mechanic of anomaly respawn is nearly unchanged since it was introduced in Dominion, yet only now does it seem to come up.
---
I known it's a game but generally making isk isn't seen as fun ( because honestly eve's pve and mining are really lacking ) and most people running them do so to well generate isk ( general for some goal outside of well running more pve ). 
---
Hate to break it to you, but the Imperium has been stress testing it already.
---
There are dozens of other posts bemoaning that it's gone. 
---
Having one post that doesn't agree is fine.  
---
Posts on /r/eve that don't agree with your point of view aren't trolling, they are just someone else's opinion.
---
In fact, many see you as the troll.
---
Did you video the meltdown I would really like to watch it?
---
Your post really helped me organize what it was I had issues with in the ever growing gamestyle slant between Empire building and Try-harding and it's a shame it didn't get much traction comparatively. 
---
I suppose the timeliness of it coincided with one bloc dunking another so it was viewed as bitter grapes, perhaps? 
---
&gt; the direction CCP keeps pushing the game in -- more casual, more forgiving, less content generation and finesse play
---
There's a reason that TEST circle-jerk about adapting to "New Eve" but I'm not sure it's an adaptation many of us would want to make. Like you state, friends are basically the only reason I haven't adapted right out of the game forever. 
---
So does a Punisher.  You even get 3x the loot!
---
&gt;Boo those nasty people that don't play the game the way I want to.
---
I hope the irony of your post doesn't escape you. 
---
Yep! Drifters wiped out a couple of concord squads as well as local patrols around the stations after the engagements at the Citadels!
---
If you'd like to help get that fixed, bug report it in-game immediately after the first time it happens.  (Doesn't help if it's been like that for a session or two.)
---
If you don't care to help get it fixed or just think it's funny, no worries, carry on. :)
---
They are still worthless wastes of money as the last 3 sets of csm have shown that ccp gives fuck all about thier opinion and they do what they want anyways. So in short CSM doesnt need to go as ccp doesnt actually care about thier opinion. Its a waste of ccp money that they seem to be very short on.

it fixed itself when I closed the window and re-opened it. I just found it hilarious. But thanks!

Eh for a gated site to work then Local would absolutely need to be removed. Otherwise, bud sees you enter system and aligns...then you show up on his short dscan (or more likely, his cloaky eyes on gate grid sees you) when you land at the in gate....then you load the site grid, and he is gonzo.   
---
I think single best thing CCP could do at this point is remove local chat outside of High Sex.
---
Sadly this garbage is most likely all on CCReeee right now.  The buyout clause means PA is likely watching them crash and burn with glee, since if they don't make numbers, PA gets the IP for half price.  Once the target dates pass, that's when PA will likely step in and go full $$$.  This is just CCP being retarded.
---
Ah, yes, let's introduce more paperwork and logistical hurdles to the game. That's going to hurt the big guys, let me tell you. They don't have a history of being extremely organized and able to handle tedium or bureaucracy. These changes will be the dawn of the era of small corporations.

But Kotaku articles about tidi fest super spam is pvp.

glad i jumped off this train when i did. enjoy you slow ride straight into the dumpster. i guess it´s the goon way after all. it just took you 10 years.

wormholer btw
---
Yeah, I take exception to the whole "just adapt" argument because it implies that there's a "right" way to play a sandbox game. If adapting to the 'new' Eve means open recruitment and multiboxing Rorquals... I mean, yes, obviously I could do that; I just don't want to. 
---
That's not the game I've enjoyed all this time flying small gang finesse stuff, picking off targets of opportunity, etc.
---
I am just pointing that CCP did not exactly having many PLEX sales in contrast to what inferred in the previous post. They did not even have Christmas and Black Friday PLEX sales, unlike previous years.

Typical of those who can't actually back up their histrionic neanderthrashings. Far be it for any of you to actually understand the game; it's better to whine.
---
Chat is still broken, it just isn't as "OMG EVERYTHING IS BROKEN AT ONCE" as it was, so it is harder to notice.  If you log in a few characters and let them sit for a bit, you will absolutely start seeing discrepencies in chat channels, including local.

I will. Don't let the door hit ya where the good lord split ya!

Why would I pay to revert to an alpha when I have already paid for nearly 10 years across 3 "main" accounts with well over 100m SPs each....why in the fuck would I ever revert "30" years of subscriptions skill training....
---
When I can just make a new fucking Alt and let my account be Alpha. 
---
Yes i can use t2. Using t2 on that fit would require power implant on that fit. But i choose to use mid grade asklepian pod on 6th implant slot. 
---
T2 is almost always a better choice for any drekavac fit that doesnt require power/cpu inplants. 
---
Wow. This really feels like the game died.
---
Isn’t being the best meaningful enough?  Some special skins and recognition for their achievement and prestige of winning are a great reward.... Why does it have to be enough isk for each player on the winning team to buy 30 titans?  
---
I might propose a good fix to this would be creating significant variation in sov, jump, gate, and structure mechanics by region.
---
Regions that have lower spawn rates with higher value per site
---
Regions that introduce aggressive jump fatigue making.
---
Regions that decrease the time between structure timers.
---
By having each region have unique mechanics it will drive better structural and content variety. The regions that retain modern mechanics will become the great cities of EVE, where wealth is highly concentrated by mechanics that allow a high density of players.
---
Regions where capitals are a rare sight,  because the jump fatigue is so intense it makes travel with larger ships too slow to reasonably muster against sub-capital fleets. 
---
This would open the door to so much possibility for every type of gameplay again. 
---
What if all this is just CCP's long-term plan to get more people to move to wormholes by making null get dull?
---
Haha faction scram was worth buying i guess. Good fight
---
It worked for me!
---
Essentially you're saying is not to reward CCP when they're doing poorly, which I understand. 
---
Is this the time they set aside and let you use the computer in that class? That is rather nice of them.
---
This is horseshit.  
---
I agree with this but I think it might be even better to just include both. Have regions where resource density is high and different regions where resource density is low.
---
That was because few people knew how the game worked, and even that was only before like, 2005. After that there's always been a very strict meta on what ships to use and how to fit them. Don't kid yourself.
---
A strict meta emerges in *any* game after a while once the basic rules are figured out and people have the means to achieve it. EVE is hardly an exception, and it's a pipe dream to expect anything else.
---
At least, until friendly fire is introduced. That might truly shake things up a bit.
---
It's a conspiracy by the Minmatar to launch a false-flag attack. 
---
I remember it used to be 3,000 PLEX for the price. Now they effective raise the price by reducing the Mount of PLEX for the same amount of $€
---
just give us drifter ships as the next faction .... and the mighty Krab titan for the angel cartel

I believe that is the freetype issue.

Add this repo to your sources list by editing in terminal
---
 `sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list`
---
add this to the end of your file:
---
&gt;deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu artful-security main
---
Then to refresh your package lists:
---
 `sudo apt update`
---
and finally 
---
 `sudo apt install libfreetype6=2.8-0.2ubuntu2.1`

Hopefully this solves your issue.
