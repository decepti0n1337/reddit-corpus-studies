How do you move ore to your production facility? Compress it in the same system you mine it. What to do if your production facility doesn't have a built-in refinery? Haul many, many loads of minerals using the biggest hauler you can fly. Or ask a corpmate for help.

I messed up this week by losing a stratios with ~8b in the cargo hold. but I started talking to the people that got me and found out they were on a special birthday roam for one of their corpmates. I may have lost 8b, but I also made someone's birthday great and I like that
---
a Triglavian assault frig is coming with it, I can't wait to fly both

I would argue there's a more nuanced way.

Activating the industrial core gives the stats boost, but also emits a 100KM skill-agnostic command burst that debufs the yield all all other rorquals nearby by somewhere between 20% and 50%.

Just comparing raw player count at any given time is a simplistic analysis of the impact FW has on the game, though.  In addition to what [deathzor42](https://www.reddit.com/user/deathzor42) said, it ignores things like how FW impacts long term player retention.  Anecdotally, I've seen loads of people over the years who have moved from my FW group to lowsec piracy, to joining the large null groups you mentioned.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
CCP obviously has legitimate business concerns driving changes, they talk about devs needing to offer a business rationale for proposed changes, but it is possible FW is suffering from shallow analysis.  There's certainly something to be said for the business advantage of picking low hanging fruit to improve things for the null groups that are a larger raw player bloc. But I'd still like to see the numbers on how FW has contributed over the years to sustaining the player base.  Like, does participation in FW tend to make a new player more likely to stick around? Even if they ultimately end up moving on to null, WHs or whatever? How does that compare to new players who immediately move to null?  How does it compare to players who stay in HS?
---
If FW participation does have a positive impact, that becomes a compelling case for keeping FW content fresh as part of sustaining the overall health of the game.

Do you occasionally get them out and ask them "wat do" when you're feeling lost and need some direction?
---
Asking a question like that here unintentionally reveals the lack of self-motivation that will cause you to fail.

I mean...then what’s the point of a tutorial? That just unintentionally shows the lack of self-motivation for new players to start the game, does it not?

With those reasoning skills there's not much hope for you. Success in general gameplay is subjective. Success in market trading is brutally objective.

Reverse psychology is how I cracked 10K karma :)
---
Emotions aside, if you want to get rich, import modules and stock the market in your nullsec trade hub. You don't need experience or insight to do arbitrage. The jump freighter does the hard work and your job consists of relisting at a 20% profit and watching your wallet flash all day. You can also segue into local production if the competition gets too stiff.
---
how was the bath tonight?
---
I’m bored at work so this was a welcome boredom killer for a few minutes lol 
---
I’ll definitely take a look into those sections. I’m not really looking to get rich but a few extra bucks here and there is definitely helpful. Thanks for the tip! 
---
More like pointing out how stupid Rorqs are and were, i can still remember ccp saying there will not be SO many Titans in game, see the new frigg meta we have today.
---
Just double module HP compared to deadspace ones - this alone gives them more resistance to heating (either officer mods or any other mods in same rack) while not really affecting anything else too much.
---

No, if it was just exchange rates then all the prices across all regions would be exactly the same. I don't mean "$10 in America, £10 in England" same, I mean "$10.33 in America, £10 in England" same. Paying the exchange equivalent of ten American dollars for a omega would be horrible for someone living in Russia, that's almost a full day's wage there and no one would be able to afford it. Prices for goods, digital or otherwise, are adjusted based on how much people are able to pay for them; value of currency is a factor in this, but it's just one of many, and has barely anything to do with exchange rates.

If you reconnect to EVE before they expire you can reconnect to lost probes.
---
Grats on learning the Rule of Six.
---
every time you undock you take a risk. learn to manage that risk. 
---
undocking an empty freighter in HS is very low risk because gankers are very unlikely to kill a ship they cant make a profit on through loot. dont undock during burn jita. 
---
undocking in a freighter with 12b cargo will get you ganked. there are ship scanners positioned in perimeter on the jita gate 24/7. If you REALLY want to move 12b all at once anyway, watch to see if you are being followed. 
---
if you mine in a t1 tanked barge in HS you are going to make less money than untanked, you are also probably not going to get ganked because untanked t2 miners abound. 
---
that same t1 barge will make more in NS, but you will have to rely on intel and alliance to create an exclusion zone that keeps you safe because concord wont show up in 9 seconds.
---
its the same for gankers.
---
in high sec you can get paid a months worth of plex for 10 ish hours of just scanning freighters while you watch netflix, 80-90m/hr cuts into profits but not having a scanner lowers how often you find a target (lowering income) and makes it harder to select a target based on how tanked they are (untanked targets are always the preference) if you bring more cats to the kill you have to pay more to replace them, but that higher cost cuts into profits. if you dont bring enough cats you dont get the kill at all. 
---
ive been on SB fleets before where we got baited on a shiny tank procurer and 80% of the fleet including the shiny blops got melted, stranding everyone else 20-30 jumps from home. blops is not zero risk. its also very low income because you will be filling your hull with torps, not loot. Blops exists to damage enemy morale and production, and should not be changed because the three way ratio of profit : risk : enemy profit destroyed is balanced imo
---
Burn huola battle where were most ships destroyed not mentioned :-(

 Can I have your or his stuff?

I was there for 7 of those and they were by far not the best battles I had in Eve. Lmao.

Ore, just increase the respawn times on asteroid spawns to force miners outside of their safe zone. Small groups that don't finish a spawn that fast aren't affected, respawn rate is dictated by industry level, but at best it's only 1 of each type to respawn within 24 hours. 
---
So you can make a system have lots of ore spawn in it, but if you mine if all you gotta leave or just come back tommorow. Fields that are not completely cleared respawn in 5-7 days or something. 
---
 Ignore the meanies, you're free to live your life ♥️
---
And remove all offensive weapons when doing so, it makes your ship lighter, since plex weighs so much. 
---
Probably the stacks of Anaconda and Python Mines that I got from an old player when they were retiring.
---
Seems they used to have Mine Fields in the game. You could fire them into space kinda like an Interdictor bubble probe, and they'd float waiting for someone to come by. Then they'd explode, kinda like getting hit by a missile.
---
But it seems the hit was always credited to you, whether you were in that system anymore or not. And if you happened to be in High Sec when someone hit your mine, you got Concord'd for attacking without provocation. So... they turned them off and got rid of them. But the Mines are still around as collector's items. =)
---
If orefields that respawn at downtime, they will be mined out by Chinese/AUTZ miners and US/EU players get to eat a turd.
---
If the respawn on 24 hours exactly, you have "miner PVP" as people try to time mining ops so that the 24 hour respawn falls exactly within their timezone.
---
That's pretty cool, didn't know that

It worked better in the old days when you could have an offgrid booster to improve your repair.

My tengu -- it's the only one I've ever flown. Same hull for nearly two years, through several wars and deployments from one side of the map to the other. If I hadn't fucked up and repackaged it would have around 50 killmarks on it, but sadly I did and now it only has 22.
---
I mean, when asked in the CSM summit - as recorded in the minutes - a segment of us was fine w/ completely removing HAWs from Titans. I personally would prefer removing most/all damage bonuses from them and leaving them as low BS DPS point defence (300-800 range), but that’s just me.
---
The mechanic for what I said was copy pasted from an ingame feature, therfore the code for it already exists, what are we waiting for, lets make the game healthier and make fights actually have a point besides morale
---
not sure miner pvp is a bad thing. internal drama that breaks up megacorps can only help distribute people throughout all regions rather than concentrate them.
---
All of this is valid. The only thing I'd add though is without people having the ability to catch up, you'll have a hard time finding people who are able to fly with you as your friends win eve.

I think he was trying to make a point that subcaps can kill carriers, while you're off on a dick measuring contest.

That is such an excellent idea, should be brought up to CCP. If only we had a focus group for stuff like this ....
---
&gt; That's about the wrongest way you can go about fixing the divide between capitals and subcaps.
---
Depends entirely from whose point of view.
---
I used to be part of an alliance that did pretty well for itself as "white knights" killing pirates out of Hek; was the most fun I've had in EVE. Then one day the local bunch of pirate scrubs misclicked and declared war on us. We were in the process of merrily taking their POCO empire when they brought in Marmite and we got thonked and ganged so hard that our leader and most competent FC joined PL, the place fell apart, and I haven't found enough to love about the game to sub for more than three months of each year since. Cool story, I know.
---
It has never been questioned that a subcap fleet could kill a regular Thanatos lol.

Pretty much this.  
---
The “solution”, depending what what you really think the problem is, is to do exactly what CCP is doing.  Make incremental nerfs in yield, tank, PANIC, IC bonuses, respawn and drone vulnerability.  
---
Over time this will decrease total ore mined in New Eden and probably the total number of people in New Eden flying the Rorqual.

Did you even read the name of the thread you're posting in? Regardless of whether it's accurate or not, that was literally what was "in question".

T1 cruiser can do it, T1 battlecruiser if you want to do it semi-afk
---
&gt;Because money comes from long-term subs, not newbies?
---
Read the latest AMA. CCPs biggest current problem is still new player retention. The wardec changes are taking a bite out of that, but they still have a huge way to go on this front.
---
Honestly, I'm surprised by the reaction I've heard from my miner friends about these patch changes. They're actually very happy about them - they mine in highsec, and think that this will increase the price on ore and minerals some. Maybe it won't - maybe it'll just cause plex to skyrocket even more than it already is - but regardless, this change won't impact *them* negatively, which I find interesting.
---
Why are u still on this thread
---
&gt;EVE has survived this long in despite of CCP (and any real competition, that's the main one), not because of them
---
\^\^ This.
---
Just think about what would happen if there actually was competition. It doesn't even need to be the same, just similar enough on some major aspects.
---
Actually tested.
---
Theres several commodities for certain regions and modt i would consider food.
---
To be honest I would not be supprised if delve gets the net biggest hit from the next patch: the super umbrella as a nearly unfightable concord if handled well will not work anymore. If my math is correct, post patch throwing a bunch of dreads at a current theta response fleet will be a near guaranteed route to a green killboard due to how cheap dreads (even with the nerf to insurance) can be.
---
How the fuck do you lose ships when you have more supers than all the opposing forces caps combined? 
---
We (init) didnt land on grid until all the titans were already dead.
---
&gt;I suppose the largest, most loyal and most engaged group of players (= paying customers) is Null Sec. So naturally CCP will prioritize their game experience over smaller and less loyal groups like FW.
---
That is somewhat true, however, a huge chunk of it is due to the self fullfilling prophecy syndrome. You ignore FW development and it becomes shit, therefore the people in it are less loyal, not as numerous etc. because they keep on leaving. 
---
So its a spiraling effect. You let it stagnate and that causes people to leave, hence less people in it. Also in the last AMA they did say that their biggest problem is still new player retention, and guess where newbros go to try stuff out in their first frigs and destroyers the most ? The retention issue is complex and comprising of many different factors and issues, but FW is definetly one of them. And if these new players don't stay due to their FW experience then they never become those longterm customers.
---
Same thing happened in GW2 in WvW. Devs ignored it for X years, then made some stpupid shit, now it looks like they're actually trying to get their shit together but its too little too late, like 3/4 or even 80% of people that played it left it. Its after the fact.

Thank you

---
They are New Eden’s premiere munition delivery service 
---
I agree that is part of it, but I don't think its the main reason. The groups in Null Sec have always been way bigger than in low sec.
---
how can i use that service?
---
Practice without fear of harm.
---
I just hope they can evac to better space in the alloted time Period. Basis for this has to do with renters being important to the game's active player numbers 
---
Sadus the day when the game loses all those players.
---
I'm not sure how but I ended up with about 70 50 run 10/20 T1 heavy fighter BPCs. I am planning on inventing them into T2 but I am not sure what the best way to sell them would be? I live in nullsec
---
They were horrible. You launched them out of missile launchers iirc and they sat there waiting. Simple enough but put 100 of them on a grid and anyone landing out of warp instantly crashes. On top of that they lasted ridiculously long time, I'm not sure they expired tbh, so they would sit there until someone hit them. So for example if you put some on a gate, jumped back to hisec to run level 3s in your expensive cruiser and 3 hours later someone runs into them, Concord shows up and gives you the ol bad touch. Those who have been playing long enough to remember them dont miss them at all believe me.

if goons didnt have the most then people would still reee about rorqs. it would just be goons and allies.
---
What if the servers performed this well in all the other fights but the FCs just wanted an excuse for the end results? Also that's not crazy high numbers for a fight 
---
pretty much on par with how CCP treats Torpedoes. Still can't believe they added a flat 10k to explosion radius on xl rages. Like fuck, gotta target paint Titans to apply 100%.
---
thanks for reps mate o7
---
That guy doesn't even own a smartbomb mach

is that a corp in a wormhole?
---
counter argument: in an attempt to stop infighting, the people getting bad timers get beaten downby leadership and cant form any kind of social rebellion. they end up quitting because they cant get the isk to plex. 
---
When I undock I always have to check my cargo value vs EHP.
---
It's a corp that goes into wormholes and gets used as target practice by actual wormhole corps.

I mean that's roughly the damage they get by just using large weapons.

Unless my memory has failed and they can't use undersized weapons.

The bonus structure will already make rapid torps borderline worse than regular torps (it's a trade off for cheap stuff, flat out worse for good purples).

Lesson from this:  Innel Hel will work with literally everyone in nullsec to kill supers.  They worked with snuffed to kill ours.  They worked with us to kill Frats.

Lost a couple Titans, a super or two, and a few faxes... = Eating shit? 
---
I have a collection of corpses I've scooped from gatecamps, ganks-in-action, and other hairy situations that I wasn't involved in.

add that to the 130b (33 dreads included) to 35b fight from earlier in THEIR tz and we had some good kill totals today.  between the sides ~135 capitals, 2 supers, 2 titans dead.
---
A day where we actually probably destroyed more than we mined between our two alliances.

will see with shield slaves if that causes 5th slot epsilon implants to go down in price.  right now they tend to be far pricier than the other 4 slots, in a large part because of shield supers needing something to pair with the CA implants.

If you can't come up with $15 dollars, have a computer, and an internet connection. You may want to consider doing something else with your free time. That being said you can do quite a bit as an alpha, but you very quickly run into its limitations. It takes away from gameplay a lot.

I buy corpses so if you dont want to keep it contract it to Orion Sa-Solo for 500k isk from any citadel.

Should have rolled some of the other mods instead tbh.

I wouldn’t say I collect them, let’s say ‘I have a number of them’.

There is one corpse I’m simply never getting rid of. It’s become some kind of heirloom, so to speak ;-).
---
If I am an alpha, do I get the benefit of trained skills (ex: drone interfacing 5) if I have it previously trained? I'm assuming not, but wanted to know if I am more powerful as omega than alpha due to skills being active.

Hi. I'm among the people who have been scoping out what happens in Eve for a while, but have yet to play myself. It's a cool thing they have opened up for an indefinite trial, so I can learn firsthand. I already know a few things, like the cut-throat nature of the game, "Never fly what you can't afford to lose", and no-safezone open PvP. The question is: Should I give Eve a whirl and see if I like it myself or what?
---
A hot Friday night like always. 
---
or just don't make the ship with the most cargo space, ehp, utility, boosting ability, compression, and jump drive the highest yield. it's almost as if one ship shouldn't do every single role of a mining fleet on it's own.
---
I recently coming back to eve starting back from zero. I decided to start with exploration. This showed me how profitable null and wh spaces are. Thanks!

Also to add to this. Empires do have capital class ships and a lot of them, just not putting those Designs up for capsuleers to buy

Perhaps you should look at Zkill before you post.  Delve is often on our delivery route !

If you train up a skill while omega and lapse the skill returns to  the max alpha level attainable.

Back then you could chain a super with 3 sanctums, now you cant, ticks are shit. My guess is they want to nerf it further. Black desert online wants people to use USD to buy game time, as indicated by the lack of plex sales recently, and all nerfs to massive isk making tools(ratting,mining)
---
You're just now figuring this out? 
---
50b. Oh wait zkb has these scrub out of delve prices. 
---
I hope they get the plex prices down a bit more, so you guys with less income can plex it at least.
---
Also, I decided to pay $ for my second account, as swiss, the cost for a month is extremely low. While you guys can profit on the lower demand for plex (even if it's effect is extremely limited, but well, what if everyone would think the same way...)

Seems like the article had a few reasonable ones, then a bunch of more recent pointless fights. Maybe the author hasn't been playing eve for very long and only knew a handful of historical events?
---
I do really like the idea of doing a proper list of influential fights in eve tho....
---
&gt; There is far more fun and risk in high sec in my opinion.
---
This has to be satire, right?
---
Highsec is such a one-side slaughterfest of clueless noobs by x-year old players with blinged out T3s and Pirate BS that even CCP realized that changes are needed, and stated these wars are so riskless and one-sided for the attackers that it is significantly effecting player retention negatively.
---
So they are the better or maybe the unbiased "Bombers Bar" - not flying bombers?
---
With the right pod and skills, your exploration capitals should be able to handle this fine. Unfortunately you can't fit all the correct rigs at the same time though, so you won't be able to get more hacking ability from those. Yet.
---
I hope it's gonna be a fleet PVE, a hard one with nice loot
---
True, but after accounting for inflation its like 10% of asakai losses.
---
But dont worry CCP totally has this covered and titan spam will never be a thing.
---
But Gonns still feed like shit.
---
&gt; pretty much on par with how CCP treats Torpedoes. Still can't believe they added a flat 10k to explosion radius on xl rages. Like fuck, gotta target paint Titans to apply 100%.
---
What do you mean, looks like 17km to me on both tq and sisi?
---
XL rages used to be 7km.
---
well, i'm one of these renters, and i don't give a shit. May loose some billions, but most of my stuff will land in asset safety in lowsec, most toons are in alpha now - who cares.
---
The decline of PL and NC over the past years is a fact, and the causes are misconception of the changes since the introduction of citadels, bad economic strategy (just look at the reports from CCP) and lazyness
---
just my 2 cents
---
It's looking like everyone who stays will be forced out soon anyways
---
What are renters going to do when a motivated group moves to attack them if their landlords won't come defend them?
---
What's the rent even for at that point, I'm wondering what kept people from attacking until now? Was xix defending them before? NC sure doesn't seem to care about defending their renters anyways
---

I used to buy famous corpses from the well known smartbomber Santo Trafficante (sometimes on «assassin» contracts). He became my friend, sort of. 
---
Before he went on a break from Eve, I asked him for his corpse. So he undocked in Jita, tried to instawarp to a bookmark, got [caught and died](https://zkillboard.com/kill/52888627/). If he managed to pick up that corpse with an alt or if he self destructed a new one. I don’t know. But according to zKill, that was his last corpse.
---
I received it. And two years later I biomassed and quit. It's now gone forever.
---
The collector in me beat my self up for not contracting it to one my (not biomassed) alts.

The hurricane fleet issue already got buffed in the last bc balance pass and even before that was an incredibly ship(it’s double damage bonus got rolled into 1 and it got its current tracking bonus of 50%!)the current version is literally the 2012 hurricane, can fit 2 medium nexts, is incredibly fast and has excellent tracking. It’s low use is down to it being damn expensive and the current meta favouring high speed cruisers. But the arty hfi crushes most kite cruisers in a couple of volleys if the pilot is semi competent (by semi competent I mean can you pay attention to transversal and shoot while it’s low?)

Generally people tend to fit afterburners on brawling frigates and MWDs in kiting frigates. If youre looking to roam FW lowsec with pulses, id go with an afterburner. If you're looking to kite around with beams, go with an MWD, but beware, the cruor is a slow ship compared to other common MWD kiters (Slicer, Garmur, Executioner, Kestrel, Condor)
---
A goons spokesperson said "we didn't want those titans anyway"

thanks

Truly EvE is the gift that keeps on giving, very pleasing to read of such an attitude from a fairly veteran player.

0 isk value though

Well as one of the renters has already said in here, they've gone alpha and just waiting for asset safety to low sec.

At the moment I have seen various people tell me you got this wrong blah blah blah and being all smug about it and suggesting that this is a bad thing.    Well news for you guys, totally expected.   Because what you need to do is gang up to try and fight as bigger groups to maintain your status as a bigger group and this is totally expected.   The question you have to ask yourself is if this change will stay like that and if you think this is the end game you need to think again.
---
The first issue is that many hisec mercs are egotistical and want to be the boss, all of their groups have ended up with long term deep disagreements and strong dislikes.   How long before that will start to blow up within PIRAT?    Not long chaps.
---
The destruction of hisec indy will happen as long as you can be bothered to get off your complacent butts to blow up structures, but most people in hisec will not give a damn.   Some will look to use the structures operated by Test and others so your creation of a larger force will do nothing, N+1 indeed.   Over time certain people will drift away to more selective war deckers or regional groups that will operate around the fringes of hisec space.    PIRAT as the top tier of hisec mercs will then end up fighting against them in a desperate search for content and will create even more stress and drama.
---
And during this time nullsec entities will be coming in and kicking over your sand castles because they can, if they can be bothered too of course.    Over time PIRAT will break apart and I expect Marmite will form once again as a selective war decker.   The only change needed for this is some sort of watch list capability and when that happens the correct balance will be achieved.
---
So when I see certain war deckers say that this is the logical conclusion, it is more the logical reaction, the conclusion is yet to happen.
---
Don't forget the pimpfit vindidcater 
---
Which is why I take great pains to not see Wingspan at all. My hull tends to be too fragile to take more than a single delivery...
---
I don't care, that's what collaterals are for.
---
Good answer... and good gameplay on your part.    Still when people complain about asset safety most of them are too lazy and lack the ability to camp the asset safety systems.
---
If you are so jealous of the price they pay, then go live there. Who cares what others pay as long as the price I pay is what I am comfortable paying.
---
I think they mean skin, the blood raider victory sking looks really legit.
---
My rather large collection of corpses is my prized possession. I always pick them up if I see them, whether it was due to me popping the pod or just randomly floating in space. The Grand Prix was my favourite event due to the sheer amount of corpses I collected.

Actually there is a button to reconnect to lost probes, so you can get them back, still having 16 is best as your launcher can reload right after cycling

Well, I've been playing since 2004, so there was plenty of time to learn and spare a few ISK. 
---
And, even if i never have been in GSF nor having any sympathy for them, i think they adapted to the changes in the game much better than any other alliance. 
---
I'd second Dodixie. I was there for quite sometime and still have loads of shit there from mission running days. Orvolle is home now. Right on the border of low and null. 
---
Well you sir are doing it right.
---
I feel pretty much the same way about GSF.     o7
---
why join an alliance that tells you what you got to fly how much you got to pvp where to mine and when to be online. when you can just avode it all for a bit of isk and do your own thing?
---
Orvolle is great! Come hang and please regularly fly through PF. The locals are fun. 
---
You have to spend a fair bit of isk on it, but then it’s super OP - thing is at least 50% of people will run. 
---
Sounds a bit kitey to me
---
You know, under the current circumstances I would have assumed the landlords would waive the payments for rent until the war is over and just ask the renters to carry on ratting/mining to keep the defensive indexes up. Anyway it's nice to see any rental empire getting burned. Down with Space Feudalism!

All ihubs in the spire are dead, except one. Multiple citadels, including a sotiyo, are dead with more coming.  Renters are being told they must pay anyway. The smart ones are leaving.
---
The macherial is the best if you want to bump something and keep it bumped. A 500WN stabber fleet issue or cynabal is a good option if you want to send something flying, but don't plan on repeatedly bumping it.
---
The values of this community are weird (in a good way though)
---
One of the bigger problems in fw is finding someone who will fight it.  It gets kited pretty easily and brawlers usually need someone to take the fight rather than catching them.  The problem comes up when most targets dont want to take the fight.
---
Noobs see pirate faction and bail and pros know how deadly it can be in nos range.
---
So webbing a corpmate with friendly fire on won't make you a valid target. You get a weapons timer because you activated an offensive module against another player, which has nothing to do with you going suspect/criminal.
---
I agree with the ganking of ships that ignore the isk/hitpoints ratio.  
---
About the ganking of barges and Ventures, meh. That would fix itself, since the amount of ore in highsec is finite, you don't have respawning belts apart from ice.
---
Tags are for repairing security status, not faction standing. For faction standing your best bet is [The Plan](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/faction-standing-repair-plan-aka-the-plan/8008). The only thing that doesn't cover is that there are also new boosters that temporally increase your standings gain. IF you stack that booster with the plan you should be able to repair you standings relativity easily. In the future I'd recommend avoiding missions that require to kill rats that belong to one of the other HS factions. you can decline 1 mission every couple of hours without taking a standings hit, and if you have high enough standings with whoever you are running missions for you can usually just decline every mission that would hurt your standings with no problem.

You can make more ISK blitzing L4 missions if the faction you are doing it for offers valuable LP. That being said this also requires a significantly higher investment and significantly more work. A VNI you warp to the site, orbit at 30 and launch drones. Come back in 30 min to warp to the next site and you are VNI ratting. The VNI is also 70mil vs the 1.5 bil mac and 2-3 bill in burner mission ships to blitz L4s in the most efficient manner.

If i remember correctly, they didn't get the shaft, because there was no tiericide for resist mods.
---
And whole point of my post was to show that in many cases officer mods are better than any other module (DCs, PDS', RCUs, damage mods, TEs, various drone upgrades), better than deadspace if similar meta (neuts, nosfs, propmods, invulns, ANPs, maybe other resist mods too) or different (scrams, webs).
---
Exceptions are not so numerous: reps and shield boosters, maybe some resist mods.
---
ps Webs fit to bhaal/vindi easily, scrams/points to barghest, sometimes even to huginn/lach in fits built around officer mod. Let alone serp/blood capitals and supercapitals.
---
Ideally you would sell them in your alliance's staging. 
---
Thanks for the daily reminder that you are dumb.

Rapid torps should get their cycle time buffed according to patch notes.

Turns out abusing new players in the “supposed” safe space is bad for overall game life and contributes to only having 12-15k concurrent players at a time, with &gt;50% of them being alts
---
You are right about all of this, but hell they were fun to watch when J0kers entered system and Krulldari had put out 1500 mines, they bounched around in a lightshow of terrifying laggout and node crash and ended up in clone station paying for theyr new clone :)
---
Wormholes my friend.
---
&gt; “supposed”
---
Right but thats not immediately made clear and experience from literally every other mmo speaks to high sec being proper pvp safe. So when they get war deccd and try to fight back but have to deal with ooc logi/links, its no surprise new player count has been on a decrease since 2011 (not including the spike due to alphas that lasted a couple months)

Are T2 Medium/Heavy drones worth it for ratting? They have worse tracking and HP than Navy drones with seemingly no advantage aside from cost. I assume they don't benefit from specialization skills though.

Not true. Isn't ganking starter areas bannable?

Attempting to abuse a new players lack of knowledge of the game and its mechanic for your personal gain or simply for their harm is prohibited in these solar systems.

This includes, but is not limited to; tricking new players into situations where you or others may open fire on them freely . . .

Players are advised to reconsider any aggressive action against new players .

Tbh the actual “elite” small gang groups dont flame each other and just expect you to learn. The “elite” fleet alliances care a bit more about losses but its mostly pressure on FCs over linemembers

I mean the pve content is lame in hs. The pvp is very niche and can be great but the lack of noob friendly corps is what makes hs die these days. There is also no reason for experienced fc and directors to stay there so half of the noobs go to the blobs while a few join shitty mining corps and quit the game shortly after.
---
The patch notes clearly state that:
---
* Rate of fire reduced by half for all Rapid Torpedo Launchers        AND...
---
* Now doubles rate of fire for all Rapid Torpedo Launchers (for Siege I and II)

So no, they didn't forget about it.

&gt;no where is safe, unless docked
---
Yes I agree, Everybody should be vulnerable to being wardecced and attacked in hi-sec. Including the logi who involve themselves in the fight.
---
Its the 'neutral' logi who are cheating the sandbox really.

And don't be so gloomy, you can still use neutral logi in NullSec can't you.

Most of the tenants have reasons to rent. Casual playstyle, low interest in pvp, dedicated miners, builders and any combination of these  are the most common causes. EVE is a sandbox, and it changes over time. Those who adapt best will survive, others will disappear.
---
I think the time has come, that those big entities, which don't integrate the industriy, miners and builders  in a fair and professional way will slowly go down the drain.

Maybe i'm wrong, but until now Goons are the best example for me that i'm right.

You can try and petition it, it is possible to get killmarks back after you repackage

No and that's the ironic thing.  A basic fact and observation is not the same as someone whining like a snowflake.

THE PLAYERS ARE RUINING THE SANDBOX!!!
---
The major difference in the ease of Eve now vs Eve in 2006 is the amount of player organization and player built tools. It's made the game so much simpler and easier to navigate. CCP has made some aspects easier, but no where near the amount that the players have done themselves.

You still don't get it don't you? :) This kind of attitude brought you in this particular spot. You got cocky, pissed off the wrong kind of people as a result you got stomped and lost your home along with months of work, citadels, cap ships and tens of billions in juicy loot (which by the way we thank you for - DO YOU THINK THE DROP COVERS THE COMBINED LOSSES?).

We can actually insta replace our losses no matter how high they are. Can you? https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99002974/reset/group/902/losses/

More importantly Vendetta is not just a name. It is OUR way of playing Eve. We are a bunch of mean and vial shitlords, we scheme and plot, we have lots of patience to wait for the decisive moment and we do not hit people for fun. We always go for the jugular. Our hits are meant to kill swiftly and decisively. You have experienced it first hand. It is a lesson you will not forget anytime soon.
---
My advice (for the simple fact that you fought well and I do respect that) find a way, and I'd suggest diplomacy, to shake off the big target that you have on your back now (the beef is not only with VMG). Continue with shitty remarks and stupid things in game or even look at VMG and allies in a funny way and you are in for round two. We are more than willing to wait months or even more until you rebuild and we will hit you again, harder this time. Do you want that to happen again?
---
I just don't understand why you would spend the isk on an what I assume are pricey abyssal mods given the officer tracking enhancer then use a T2 DC.  At least use a faction one.

nope, because they're making themselves valid targets by repping LE members

Is this a copy pasta? Reads like one.

This! Ccplz
---
The fact that they don't defend the renters and still expect them to pay anyway proves that renters these days are \_literally\_ retarded.
---
Cliffs notes: logi ships that are in neutral (to both sides of a war dec) corporation/alliance can rep participants and only pay for the privilege by going suspect (and letting anyone shoot them). What makes it bad is that a) you do not see them in local, b) you cannot preemptively shoot logi, only once they start repping and c) once you do shoot them, you get a limited engagement timer with them that prevents *your own* logi from repping you without going suspect themselves. All in all, a shit mechanic that makes no sense to anyone not intimately acquainted with wardecs.
---
They routinely hit this number, then have a purge and accept more
---
Thanks!

remove excavators from the game

If you are so keen about the "true sandbox", then why are you playing in high-sec? It's so restrictive. Or could it be that you don't care about the sandbox and only want to fight unfairly so you always win?
---
hey lets jump in our titans one by one
---
the entire ganking mechanic is a massive sandcastle built in an area with almost no sand
---
it's the pinnacle of what a sandbox mmo is

Aren't they `adapting` by merging into a bigger group?

Killing defenseless newbies in areas where they are supposed to get a grip on the game? God that's pathetic. Null is a sandbox. HighSec is tutorial. If you'd want to play a sandbox, you'd play null. You aren't. So you aren't interested in the sandbox, you are only interested in your tidy little sandcastle that nobody can knock over because you built it where nobody wants/can do that. 
---
It's a little obscure and not posted very often but yes this is pasta.

&gt;HighSec is tutorial.

your opinion.

&gt;If you'd want to play a sandbox, you'd play null.

why would i purposefully put myself at a disadvantage?

CCP explicitly condones my activity in highsec. CCP has repeatedly stated that gankers provide a good to eve online in general. High sec is the highest population density space in eve.

ask a gm via ticket
---
you do not gain invulnerability every time you re-enter a rookie system
---
that means about 18000 of the imperium are slacking.

read the link again. Then a third time. If you wanna risk it- Go for it and gank a rookie in a rookie system. Link that KM mate.

Imperium has very roughly 3x the characters that Panfam has, not counting renters on either side and the querious fight club dudes.

Geminate + Vale + Tribue + Tenal had \~2t mined in february

idk where you got your numbers from, but that's not "almost identical per capita" in my book
---
can you find examples of them calling themselves good?
---
How much for one?
---
Its not really stupid, though.  There is nothing stopping people from doing it already, but most rorq miners I know (myself included) invest enough to get an isk/h we're comfortable with and then stopping.  If I make more than enough with 5 rorqs to sustain my activity now, why bother adding more?  If yield is nerfed, I do need to add another one to keep the same income, it is pretty trivial to do so.  If the nerfs are big enough that I have to add several, I may finally just go full retard and multibox 40 of them like some people already do.

Great, time to melt video cards again in stations, where most people are AFK?
---
You're making the claim. Post the proof son. Better yet- gank a newbie in a rookie system. Show the KM. Then prove to me it's doable. I'll gladly agree with you then. Until then "ask a GM" isn't gonna cut it fella.
---
Can’t clipboard if you can’t read.
---
Oh come on. If you shoot them, you get limited engagement and make your own logi suspect and vulnerable to be blapped by neutral nados or some shit. It's in no way a fair mechanic at present.

Perhaps the various navies don't feel the need to integrate destroyers in their doctrine?
---
I mean, a ship that is absolutely excellent against small, fast frigates, which are the usual ships preferred by criminals when they make a run through a faction's jurisdiction, is obviously of little use to the local law enforcement.
---
Then again, the various navies also aren't using interdictors or mobile disruptors to trap the outlaws, so let's not nitpick.
---
HAHA IT'S FUNNY IF I SAY IT FIRST AND NOT TRAGIC HAHA

Thank you for thay quick and excellent customer response.  However i'm afraid   that at such high cost , I will have to move my business elsewhere.  And risk the scam as these uprice are nowhere near reasonable for this kind of job.  I apreciate the quick answer and wish you a fair day. 
---
Renting is literally the dumbest thing one can do in EVE 2019.  It made some sense in the past for the super-PVP-adverse, but now you can join literally any nullsec bloc and have next to no responsibilities, the required couple fleets a month pressing F1 take far less time than the time it would take to pay your rent, and then you get a ton of advantages on top of it that renting corps just don't have.
---
You also get far more protection against invasion, which is supposed to be what you pay for anyway.
---
&gt;You cannot gank/scam people in rookie systems.
---
&gt;Better yet- gank a newbie in a rookie system.
---
Which is it? No ganking/scamming people in a rookie system or *newbies* in a rookie system?
---
You have a massive issue in actually defining and sticking to your terms.
---
Ganking/Scamming *newbies*  in a rookie system isn't allowed, and CCP's definition of *newbies* is definied by whether or not they've left the rookie system, have alts that have left the rookie system, or whether or not they've docked and started pursuing non tutorial action.
---
The only way for me to prove this to you is for you to ask a GM. It takes a day or two, and will give you your conclusive answer.
---
You cannot gain scam immunity just by rolling an alt in a rookie system and making a deal there. You cannot gain scam immunity just by moving back into a rookie system. These two things should make more than enough sense to you. You cannot gain gank immunity simply by living in a rookie system long term. Just check the killboards for the rookie systems, people fucking die there, and the killers aren't banned.
---
If you just applied your brain at 5% power you'd see the stupidity and lack of consistency in your arguments.
---
Lmao, you wouldn’t do this in delve, cowards!
---
Oh come on. If they rep you, they get limited engagement and make themselves logi suspect and vulnerable to be blapped by neutral nados or some shit. It's in no way a fair mechanic at present.
---
Yeah ,  I was hoping for a safe Player owned structure. But the fee is a bit too much for what I aim. I have acces to those in a WH but I dont wish for such a long job to be in a wh citadel.

My other option was  a npc station or my personnal WH citadel.  Highsec seemed safer xD

CCP Sharq's (hopefully still) frozen corpse
---
a lot of people have been banned without reasons and without clarification since 2013.
---
I've been banned "Pending Investigation" three times, twice without reason and a third with a reason only given post unban. Every single one of these was overturned as they were unfounded.
---
I was finally banned a fourth time and that time "permanently" for "Disproportionate use of server systems" or someshit like that. I guess it was for making 500 alpha accounts and trying to start my own SP farm. Coolio, whatever, they let me start over but under the premise that I could be permabanned for any offense here on out without warning or further consideration.
---
But why take a faction web and point if you're cloaky and polarized blasters.
---
They might have banned you to protect you from hacking.
---
A good pasta then.
---
I wouldn't take my little joke quite that seriously. The insecure basement dwellers are already up in arms about it.
---
This is a good point, but in this case they explicitly tell you to "Contact Customer Support" because your "Account is Compromised"
---
&gt; incorrect opinion
---
The sandbox is supposed to restrict the player as little as possible. Which is the case in null.
---
&gt;why would i purposefully put myself at a disadvantage?
---
Are you serious? You aren't "putting yourself at a disadvantage" by shooting something besides freighters and miners for once. You are playing the game. If you just want a green killboard say so.
---
&gt;CCP explicitly condones my activity in highsec. CCP has repeatedly stated that gankers provide a good to eve online in general. High sec is the highest population density space in eve.
---
Which is why they are reworking wardecs, specifically because of you activity in highsec? And we both know that highsec "pirates" have come a long way from the opportunistic gankers of the past. Also, highsec is the second smallest collective area in EVE.
---
&gt;Me and mine have created entire game mechanics in high sec, an area where it wasn't intended, and have benefitted eve online in ways unforseen, and even endorsed by CCP. What have you done?
---
Which are? Please enlighten me. And how have you benefitted EVE? I can very distinctly remember CCP only changing wardecs because you are literally the cancer that's turning new players away from the game. On that note, what have we, the largest new player oriented group in New Eden, really done for the game? Except, you know, helping to keep it alive by introducing those very same new players that you would have otherwise scared away to the actual gameplay.
---
&gt;also incorrect, the majority of those ganked aren't even newbies.
---
Maybe not of those ganked, but definitely of those wardec'd.
---
&gt; The sandbox is supposed to restrict the player as little as possible. Which is the case in null.
---
Your opinion, once again.
---
&gt;Are you serious? You aren't "putting yourself at a disadvantage" by shooting something besides freighters and miners for once. You are playing the game. If you just want a green killboard say so.
---
I want to gank, high sec is the only place I can. What's so wrong in that?

highsec has by far the highest player density in eve, period.

Ganking outside of highsec is called whaling. You should try it, it's fun. But you won't because there's a very real chance that your opponent will shoot back. Can't have that shiny green killboard go down the drain now, can we?
---
&gt;highsec has by far the highest player density in eve, period.
---
Which is not relevant. If you were to cram all null players into geminate, that would also have the highest player density. It's about how many people play there, not how many people play there per system.
---
i've been playing for over a decade and have heard of precisely one of those, don't think they were that important
---
Shoulda donated sperm, could get 2 packs.
---
UALX was fun until the fighters and TiDi came. But the real fun came later that week when BL rescued the bubbled and supposedly trapped caps!
---
Dude, I checked out your Instagram, I really love that Drifter six piece. Overall awesome style, I dig it!
---
Indeed, much like how the French government adapted by exiling themselves to another country during WW2.
---
You've hit the nail on the head. T2 heavies and faction heavies are about equivalent. Factions are still more durable though. Unless you lose *a lot* of them it's not worth the 30 day train.
---
Its fsj, nothing of value was lost
---
Yes, sir.
---
That was always the plan when we started horde, yes. And is how I lost my day one horde chars - went inactive for a year and they got purged totally rightfully. For all the memes, horde is reasonably well run internally.
---
Number 10 will shock you!
---
\- omni

\+ drone nav
---
continue VNI ratting
---
Couldn't imagine. Definitely would turn off blink in corp lol
---
No it does not. Launcher is protecting you account from "hacking".
---
A delivery of another random collection of nonsense? I understand you are very proud of being affiliated with those Wingspan guys (please note I used capital W, even though I don't recall ever seeing them on grid). So my original question stands.
---
Rengar?
---
Sovereignty Structures now correctly show "Launch for Corporation" instead of "Launch for Self".
---
Can we get this for bubbles, mtus? And mobile depos too? Eg so everyone in corp and use and scoop them? 
---
Horde actually doesn’t use Corp or alliance chat channels
---
One thing about Horde is they have pretty good response fleets when you get ganked 
---
CCP generates content, but the content most desire is in the form of annihilating their enemies and collecting their tears. This kind of content is best provided and served by capsuleers. As it has always been in New Eden.
---
you are
---
It’s an excellent old salt post from highsec warriors now a copy pasta
---
purloined sansha data analyzer will always get throught safety systems xD
---
?
---
Lol Wingspan are trash. They don't take fights, don't fly actual PvP ships and are not even a real wh corp. All they do is kill Herons 1 jump from Jita.
---
It's not funny man. I really want to see your face when your accounts will be banned "because someone think that you...". 
---
could not find either. even  wikipedia. 
---
Keep the tissue, you need it more than me considering you're the only one here who's salty. Did WiNGSPAN evict you?
---
and blow MTU's in highsec, sad!

u/Remidogg
---
well it depends.   did someone sent to him isk / items? even  if this was done  once or twice  few years ago. ccp is slow and they an ban for past events,infractions doesnt expire in ccp opinion.
---
eventually if you were sending isk or items between alts this in some cases will trigger  GM attention on you.stupid but true..
---
there is no full truth. tickets cannot be unanswered and closed as solved. someone would be need really upset about it to keep guy off eve.  
---
insults,threats,sexual speech wasnt used? there is numerous ways to trigger ccp ban.
---
i never was banned but my friend did get  12 month ban for   extrme offensive language.. so much salt that triggered ccp.  he lost fking  bling tengu long ago,not by pvpers,pvpers were trying to tackle it but he landed into triggered   guristas haven and he was murdered by rats. he poured angryness on them and  they ticketed it. 
---
What if it's a multicrew ship?
---
Am I tho. 
---
&gt;Point is that they ban really playing people, but RMT still alive and they know how to avoid this (today any monkey know how hide himself in internet). So... In the end in eve will be ONLY RMT players, because all others will be banned. LOL 
---
So you're saying that you were **not** participating in an RMT scheme in any way..?
---
While your game dies around you, okay, the people that need their hands held won't stay without further pussymode anyway
---
Skins included on kill mails when ccp?
---
HABIT #1
---
I suppose it has amarr origin, as amarr were the ones who developed it. Much like new t2 trig ships:
---
- Nergal gallente (who already have ships named after mesopotamian deities, i.e. Utu) 
---
- Draugur minmatar (norse like many minmatar ships) 
---
- Ikitursa caldari (Iku-Turso is finnish and some caldari corp sound finnish, idk if they have any ships named after sea critters or after finnish mythology)
---
But no idea what's the actual meaning behind it. 
---
Yup, blame it on mobile
---
Mobile users are fucked though. Currently in the Reddit is fun app and it's cancer
---
Yeah, I even looked for a link with the Slavic deity Rodiva, some sort of parent, or something, but it seems there is none
---
Mystery, mystery...
---
Hey, that's a whole bunch of lies ! Sometimes we operate 1j from Amarr as well.
---
I still have the first ship I purchased, a rifter, in a hangar in Jita. 
---
from the perspective of a hunter.i would like to see null sec far more dangerouse than it is this days...make tethering useless while u got pve/pvp agro timer...gimme a chance to probe your shinie before u get tethered or i guess the right structure u go from thousands in system(lol...make them drop loot god dammit)
---
Null sec right now is so boring,smart guys travel in carrier /supercarrier from citadel to citadel,run the ded plex and laugh in your face(or use the bops),unless they are not fast enough to get probed in plex
---
So they ban (no answers about 3 monthes...) and wait for extremely language? I think they can be 'such persons'...
---
And yes they "close" petitions as resolved and no comments at all, they even close access to support site. I cannot log in to create a ticket. As my all accounts are connected I have no access to support at all... ATM all I can do is to "send mail to support@ and help@"...
---
Aw, that's cute that you think I'm salty. Has Wingspan ever evicted anyone? That's an honest question. 
---
Why do it in Delve when you have perfectly good retards out of range ?  
---
I'm going to leave this here because it fits the title of the post better. https://youtu.be/pEUQFebH_P0         
---
Damn thanks for posting that
---
fuck the game ailoace...bag pola in el...nu cumperi un caedes?
---
Banned for too many alpha accounts? Lol 
---
All the time. Although the evictee's have to have done something to warrant it...
---
See [J212906](https://zkillboard.com/system/31000775/) from December 14, 2018 - Jan 06, 2019.
---
So as a Wingspan director allow me to answer this question.
---
Yes we have evicted people in the past. However we only do it if we have a good reason. 
---
We try to avoid full evictions as they can be long drawn out affairs that can end up going horribly wrong if done poorly. So a lot of planning is needed.
---
Also a lot of us hold the view that evicting someone makes wormhole space more dead, which is something no one associated with spooky space wants.
---
So yes whilst we are capable of doing evictions we only tend to do then if someone has really annoyed us.
---
Closest thing that comes to my mind would be Ohrmazd, god of  Zoroastrianism, but that would imply some etymological gymnastics.
---
I don't have a bachelor's degree or any college degree so they won't accept my sperm.
---
Well yes, but you have to multibox and sub one more, what's wrong with that ? We've seen the PLEX market being pretty pressured from over multi-boxing and it's not going to stop. Sure rorqual should be revamped so that multiboxing isn't a thing, but then again when are we going to see that ?
---
Or I want opinions on the game there is also that
---
yes boss
---
Welcome back to your keyboard lol. We're pretty sick of these posts at this point. 
---
Risk vs Reward. Eve is a gamble. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
---
You know for a fact these corps will run the moment any kind of risk appears, it doesn't matter what counter you print even a wet paper bag scares these people.
---
Wingspan are a semi-role playing corp, built up from a bunch of videos their CEO, Chance Ravinne, made [https://www.youtube.com/wingspantt](https://www.youtube.com/wingspantt)  Chance was an entertaining noob, and his videos of stealth-bombing miners in wormholes (IMO) did a really nice job of capturing the initial thrill of w-space ganking.  He called this "delivering torpedoes" and often sent Eve-mails role playing these supposed deliveries to the gankees.
---
Wingspan, the corp, has generated a lot of memes, mostly around the themes of being terrible-at-Eve, cringey, and not-real-wormholers.  One of those memes is that they never leave the 5 km jump range from a high sec static (like a B274), so that they can easily disengage if a fight begins to go against them.
---
I'm Web Developer with 12 years of experience - so YES I know how internet technologies works. And NO - I was not participating.  
---
Nowday GMs do \*hit and ban everybody around with RMT guys. It's the same like yhou were passing some place and later you will be blamed like a murder. Good think that in RL you can protect yourself (but wait you should not do this until  the prosecutor has evidence of your involvement). But in EVE. You just recieve ban and... That's all, nobody cares. And as I said, only RMT "starts again playing".
---
And about everybody around - It's ccp to ban all bots\\rmt\\etc. not players. Now you you have 'any \*hit int your corp' - you will be banned, and nobody care that you don't know about it..  
---
You are "guilty without vein" when you "Aceept License Agreement" on registration... That's what "EVE Online" is.
---
Well... Marmites have been kind a terribad for a long time. Pirat seems to know how things work, even in w-space.
---
This is like asking a married person if you should tie the knot, on a wedding forum.
---
Fine, I'll make an awoxing spy

Congrats you are 68/% of average logged in numbers . On any given day if you are all logged in. 
---
I think you’re taking him too seriously if you think so, whatever he posts actually makes me chuckle at times, specially since he puts so much effort into that shit 😂
---
It isn't, you must decide.
---
I dunno if it's fair to compare Wingspan with other alliances since they're pure PvP versus WH occupants.  They don't have home holes to camp.  They don't have mining fleets to jump.  They don't have fights coming to them.  Instead, they can pick and choose their fights and only engage when they have superior numbers to win.  
---
both alliance and corp chat dont get used at all
---
So much reee
---
True, but thats how wormholes were originally intended to work by the devs.

so what
---
They work off Missile mechanics, yes.
---
you are wrong about the "effort" part. 
---
Absolutely. It put a smile on my face to read that you gave some money to at least one player newer than you.
---
Fly safe o7
---
Noice
---
Doctor, it hurts when I do $THING
---
I mean realistically I always estimated about 600 actual humans were active members you could count on for a fight, the rest were just alts, spies, krab alts for people who don’t even live in nullsec etc.
---
What? How is this even applicable here?
---
NEVER. ALL RMT SHOULD BE BANNED FOREVER.

You speak about this asspanke ?

From my understanding the faction drones don't benefit from the specialization skills, yeah. It's worthwhile to train them up but it's not high priority.
---
ah yes, ganking, the thing that shouldn't be done
---
Well shit.  You could still knuckle one off in a urine sample cup just for funzies, and the look of disgust on the nurse's face.
---
That is the most comprehensive answer I could ever hope for, thank you.

Perhaps, Hilmar Pétursson was right, EvE does have beneficial impact on humanity.

You can just change the email on the account...
---
I quite often find I get 2 or 3 vs 1 and it still wins a lot of those fights. The 36km web with overheat means that most kiters that get close enough to do good damage cant stay there for too long. Thereare exceptions of curse and it has to be piloted properly as always. 
---
In summing up yes I agree that if you're looking to rack up rambo style kill counts you might be dissapointed, however the best fights I have had have nearly all been in this ship with few exceptions.
---
I am a horde member that just joined a couple pf weeks ago. Am i lucky?
---
Take a break dude
---
you cant awox outside of your corp

And we dont need fax!
---
We have been shut like this in init us tz 6 month ago now we use more fax in this case.
---
At least Volta did better than the north during the whole last war lol.
---
Killing is being nice in eve. You would for sure attack their structure, if nothing else you may get a fight. 
---
Just shoot it.
---
You can always have the talks with them If they form a defensive fleet 
---
Well have you considered mailing the CEO? 
---
I would try to reach out with an offer and if no response/hostile I would bash it. Maybe form a pact with everyone in system and give some mining rights to them (tax them out the ass tho) or some isk as payment.
---
Are R16 moons the best you can get in HS?
---
you take Eve life very seriously. Have you ever really loved a man?

Why your dreads should have a saber in them :-)
---
oooooooof

They're too good for the current PL. They expect fun where there's none to be had, just frustration. No, not joking.

I believe her memorial was left on the ground in a Taco Bell parking lot.
---
The question is how you could afford them to begin with.
---
High or lowsec? 
---
10 days.
---
I'll bash it. 750m
---
How so
---
Renting is a protection racket - change my mind.
---
Also, a protection racket without protection is just a racket.
---
It's been 30ish hours since we sent mail with an offer to buy it. Still no response tho I am at work atm. 
---
I was on the tail end of living off the money from selling my MTG collection, new accounts are cheap and were self sufficient pretty much right out of the gate with very little investment. By the time I had expanded as far I was going to I had already been working again at around 70 hrs a week. I use earned isk when I can, and plex the accounts via cheap time directly when I can't. 
---
yeah, tell your dad I said hi 
---
Nothing says "I love you" like a killmail.
---
No, it is very easy to get in. That said welcome and we are glad to have you.
---
How do you get that flair?
---
Ahh ok. It's just uncommon for a &lt;1 year old player to have dozens of alts. When I started I shit my pants because I lost my mission running Thorax worth around 50 mil lol
---
Can’t you just petition and get your account back to recover the corpses?

Tru dat.  5 year break, got sucked back in

---
Bash at your earliest convenience, they will get the message. I would try reaching out again you some one, just because buying it saves you a bunch of hassle.
---
Why do you need a corp to bash an low power structure ? Just in some kind of battleship and kill it. If it's defended don't take the fight and you know it's not complete afk.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/wiki/flairs
---
The only thing done in delve is krabbing and rmt
---
A lot of people are afk, but that's still a helluva number. Compare to guilds in other games, EVE is something else. 
---
You lost your day-one Horde characters because they were spies. 
---
Goons will open Period Basis as a renting area, don't expect monthly payout nor bullshit "We are too leet to defend who feed us"
---
To be fair, they also spend four hours organizing a drop of three bombers and two stratioses on a Venture in a C2 gas cloud.
---
can confirm. even the ares pilot is dancing naked outside with him now.
---
Id buy your Omega from Markee Dragon.
---
His is always US price so the cost would depend on your currency vs the US Dollar.
---
To give you an idea of how much that saves when CCP did an Omega sale recentally their "Sale" price was still higher for me than buying from Markee Dragon's site which wasn't matching the sale.
---
We would prefer to keep our War history clean as it is at the moment, Tho we do have the means kill it.
---
Because of the fex nerfs, post patch throw a bunch of dreads at the wall and it becomes mathmatically impossible to tank at some point, and utterly impractical to tank suprisingly quickly. 60-70 dreads on field would require about 100 fax to tank, and it gets worse from there.
---
Probably the fax rep nerfs. There is going to be a certain number of dps that will kill a Titan no matter how many faxes show up. However, I doubt people will be using enough dreads to hit that amount, because even if you killed the Titan you’d probably go isk negative 
---
Folding into goons deleted their corp. Rip
---
Guy thinks himself a nullsec empire mastermind and knows every fact and busts every narrative. So when you insulted his space goon buddies (even if you weren't serious), it directly sent impulses to his limbic system, which is responsible for human emotions, and also lowered the activity in the pre-frontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for critical and rational thoughts and decision making. 
---
Said limbic system generated a flurry of emotions and this particular person apparently had a hard time handling those (anger, embarassment, sense of inferiority and inadequacy, etc). 
---
To come to terms and end the emotional torment, people usually vent in many different ways, be it physical or mental. This particular individual decided to vocalize his emotions outwardly in an attempt to solicit empathy from his surrounding animal peers, a technique seen in most primates. However, not every primate uses the same techniques, and not all techniques mean the same thing across all primate species.
---
In the 2007 paper of the Humane Society Institute for Science and Policy, Author Dr. F. Wemelsfelder states: _"A classic
---
example is to interpret pictures of open-mouth grinning in primates similarly to human laughter, as an
---
expression of friendly enjoyment (Foley 1935), whereas in primates this facial expression tends to signal
---
a mixture of fear and anger (Van Hooff 1972). However, if one was shown the animal interacting with its 
---
surroundings, rather than an isolated image of its face, this mistake would be much less likely to occur. It
---
is not the grin that is the body language; it is how the animal grins, how its whole body moves, that makes
---
the grin an expression of fear, or anger, or something else. "_ [Source](https://animalstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=http://scholar.google.ch/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1099&amp;context=acwp_asie)
---
So, the only real explanation for this is that said individual was ruffled by what he perceived to be a direct insult on your part, and, lacking critical communicational skills, missed the apparent light-hearted nature of your comment and lashed out back in an attempt to vocalize his rage towards your insult.
---
That few?

I've been watching Eve from the sidelines since 2003 and am a veteran gamer. I had 4 accounts before I was 60 days in game. I wouldn't even be here if it weren't for the Abyssal content update last summer. Had an add for Solo PvE and gave in. Funny thing is there's been so much of the stuff I didn't think I'd like (fleets and other kinds of PvP) that I quit running abyssals months ago.
---
nobody cares about war history. having offensive war history will makes you less like juicy targets to wardeck.
---
well did you remember anything that could lead to this situation?
---
getting banned from submitting support tickets is odd.  perhaps you did something nasty?
---
My Komodo. There are only a handful of people in the game that have one so i guess its pretty rare. I also have an estamel's invuln on it thats over a decade old at this point so thats cool.

Vial is a glass cylinder for liquids.... you are small glass liquid shitlords?

Yes as of two to three days ago i've noticed a huge drop in materials and triglavian surveys dropping in the tier 5 electrical/exotic sites. Main reason i noticed, was because every two site normally. My cargo hold would be full and i would have to dock to empty it. Now i can run four or five sites before i have to dock. 
---
Complete freedom. Do whatever however. I joined a long time friends corp. He through me straight into a strat op fleet. I was lost but i had a blast. I quickly learned basics of tackle and game got better and better. 
---
I joined a big null corp, Dreddit when I first started. I quit after a week or two of trying to get help and be heard over everyone. Then I came back 3 months later and someone held my hand (Townsaver) which helped me actually get into the game.
---
People are what is going to get you hooked into the game. Anywhere you go in eve, you just need the right group, someone to help show you the way, and fly with you.
---
faction warfare back in 09
---
my best solution is.  contact all members of said corporation,inform them that if hey wont answer within X time (where X can be 2 weeks 3 weeks ) if they still wish to continue use of low power structure for free repairs or they want to sell it. if no reply within said time [those 2 or 3 weeks)  you declare war and bash the thing.  
---
being rude isnt good tbh. try diplo  first. if they dont want it anymore then they should sell it to you,if they refuse or do not reply at all -  RAZE IT TO GROUND.
---
hint: check the corporation on zkill for  latest kill/loss so u can find out if they still play

Nani the fuck did you just fucking iimasu about watashi, you chiisai bitch desuka? Watashi'll have anata know that watashi graduated top of my class in Nihongo 3, and watashi've been involved in iroirona Nihongo tutoring sessions, and watashi have over sanbyaku perfect test scores. Watashi am trained in kanji, and watashi is the top letter writer in all of southern California. Anata are nothing to watashi but just another weeaboo. Watashi will korosu anata the fuck out with vocabulary the likes of which has neber meen mimasu'd before on this continent, mark watashino fucking words. Anata thinks that anata can get away with hanashimasing that kuso to watashi over the intaaneto? Omou again, fucker. As we hanashimasu, watashi am contacting watashino secret netto of otakus accross the USA, and anatano IP is being traced right now so you better junbishimasu for the ame, ujimushi. The ame that korosu's the pathetic chiisai thing anata calls anatano life. You're fucking shinimashita'd, akachan.

well i came from Star Trek Online.   the thing i HATED was that in star trek. ALL THE TURRET LASERS COME FROM 1 PIXEL ON THE SHIP.
---
so seeing EVE had different turrets (AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE TURRET) for each one.    well i was caught instantly.
---
eventually my trial ran out, and being a highschool kid. couldnt afford a sub.  so i left
---
in college. i returned.  this time due to the trailers.   and i could afford a sub.  my first goal.   HURRICANE.    this ship looked like everyhting i dreamed of.    got it and did lv 3 missions. 
---
and then said fk off and tried lv 4s.......it was inefficient, slow,  but i was playing for fun.   lasted 3 years or so.(yes...years of nothing but lv 4s in...a variety of ships...i should probably mention i had 0 clue what LP was.)
---
eventually college took over again. and i had to step away.
---
after college, was playing WoT when some friends expressed an interest in EVE, and i remembered i knew how ot play it.   so i offered to teach them.
---
and i've bene here since,  solid no break subscription for 3 years. finally in Nullsec (also i know what LP was.  so finding some 16m Caldari Navy LP was.....nice....and a little shameful now)
---
tldr;   visual turrets,  trailers,  and friends.
---
I like it. Good post.
---
The one part I don't see happening though is moving BPCs out of DEDs. Why? Because as you say it might push players into belts. There is almost no good reason to spend time in lowsec belts all things considered. Adding another reason to go there would actually tip the scales and cause fewer people to go there, not more. I think that for the most part pricing around faction ships is semi-reasonable, with Vigilants still seeing prices upwards of 200 mil for a full, for example, in one of the most heavily farmed areas next to blood space.
---
I think that lowsec needs help, but not more specific belt rats. Higher consistent value is what they need.
---
Not 1 person cares about a corps war history just shoot the damn thing, do it on an alt Corp if you’re so worried.

I owned a random tower in solitude for 2 years and I found it it got shot after like 1 year so I came back and shot the new owners shit. So there is no "reasobale time to respond" as they wrote me an eve mail that they wanted to buy it but it was on an alt I normaly don't use.
---
rest are test spais
---
atleast 9000 of these are spys

It's still an awesome blops hunter. Put skirm boosts on it and a faction scram and say yes to 24km scram.

Heard and participated in two of them, heard only of another two. At the time they were big.
---
But even if one lived under a rock back in 2009-ish - one probably heard of MAX2 invasion of Tribute. That was certainly big, at the time.
---
Yeah, maybe some mechanics were still too shady for me and it got me lost.

Even if I love reading theory about the game, the content is so much daunting in eve online . ^^

Did you do some Roleplay back in the days or did you just find it a good way to learn the game or was it just pleasing you so you kept doing that ?
---
Providence is the best.
---
It was so good after the patch i injected loki on my alt 😃.               
---
            
---
Its still ok its just the Loli is better
---
Ahaha thanks for your pov

That is scavenging right ?

name checks out

Hahhaha get it because the username is relevant to the comment!!!11!!!!!!1!

Hahhaha get it I’m an asshole-troll bot that bullies people for using jokes!1!1!!!1
---
I was always a big fan of pvp in games and Faction warfare was a great way to dive in head first to learn the ropes, but no I did not do roleplaying, just pew pewing
---
How does it change now? Impossible to aid, concordokken, something else?
---
No....if goons could build one they would have done so already 
---
Eh. It makes good fleet practice to go through the motions.
---
weak message dude.
---
Local chat and undocking games tbh. I spent my first few months living in Rens talking in local and watching other people do duels/ganks on the station undock, back when Rens was really active still. What hooked me is it just felt so alive compared to other games I played, like it was another world rather than a theme park where everyone is just ignoring each other.
---
I'd say my mine blueprint. You can still make them but they don't do anything. I make some every now and then to sell.

It would work well for solo bombers, but would be absolutely useless for group ops, like pipebombs

Drop NCFAIL rental alliance ASAP

Yeah, I do get it, but other people might have overlooked that person's username and thus be missing out on some good joke. YoUaReSoHiLaRiOuS, please be mindful of the people who might have a good laugh thanks to this comment. Do not ruin their fun.

To the real humans reading, do not stop doing what you enjoy because some jerk decided to write a bot that makes fun of people making jokes.

Tsar must

No content in game has grabbed me like the community. 
---
So find a corp with a culture close to your own and make friends.
---
Beyond that whs are where my heart is c2-3 specifically. 
---
Stain. Because.
---
Never use the suggested app
---
Dont fuel your station, loose your station.
---
BLOW IT UP. Afk leads to destroyed assets.
---
Take the moon and dont look back. Worst that will happen is they'll hire pirate to hunt you but I REALLY doubt it. Most corps with low powered stuff are dead/afk.
---
Concordokken
---
But there's no lowsec gate.
---
now that's what I call an unfortunate autocorrect
---
Probably what got me hooked was when a Tengu, Loki, and brawler Naga thought they could take gate guns against my slasher alt. All three of them proceeded to get own zoned by my hull tanked Brutix. I managed to MJD off the second a Chimera landed on grid. I tried to come back for seconds after, but by then they had 4 people and the tankiest Caracal I have ever fought, and I just ended up dying before killing anything else. It felt great to kill 1.3 billion worth of ships with only a 25 mil loss on my side after insurance. 
---
just stack shield buffer you'd be fine up to a certain amount, or stack bulkheads etc.
---
Bash shield and armor. At 95% of the shields corp will get ping that their structure is being bashed. Then they will discover an eve-mail from you. Negotiations will occur.  
---
Or you will reinforce it and get to structure timer. Prepare to fight defenders (which may to be none) and kill it. :EZ::Clap:
---
hisec piracy is serious business
---
Wait, what was that french wormholer corporation, please ?
---
Hear, hear
---
i also shocked from hearing this and as i get the mail from ccp i directly cancel my subscribetion. cant afford the play this game at this price , and my corpmate same toughts as me too they deceding to not worth playing anymore becouse off grinding for plex every month 
---
as for new player from my region they not gonna even consider to play this eve, when they saw this price 
---
Feel the same about the Tengu. I've PYFA-ed some designs that are close to what I had before but I am still not pleased.  Actually I pissed.
---
The thing I'll never understand about CCP is it's normally business insanity to do things that is more likely increase displeasure in a larger percentage of your customers that it will create pleasure in those who applaud or just accept nerfs and other mechanics changes.
---
I personally got disgusted about some nerfs they did and left about 4 years ago which means that's a bit more than $1000  CCP didn't make from PLEX sales to me. 
---
Yeah  you might say I'm just one guy, but 10 people who get disgusted like I did  is $10k and 1000 people is $1 Million. It adds up. FAST. And one of the fundamental principles of business is it costs more to get a new customer than it does to keep a customer
---
Logi -&gt; concorded, links -&gt; not applying (thank fuck for this, accidentally concording yourself because you didnt realize someone in your NPSI fleet had a wardec would suck major balls).
---
It was dirt cheap before, now it's roughly the same price as any other games with subscription services.. smh
---
I apologize . I didn't realize that Legacy wasn't updated promptly. Yup we're in full WAR mode now
---
I must say I was hoping for an answer like this.
---
The interaction with people is what first interested me (when MMO were still a new concept to me).
---
its a daily battle for me
---
Oof!
---
How much in dollars or euros was the price before and how much now for you?
---
That is a nice story :) 
---
Thank you very much for your pov 
---
Its slow though. Needs some hyperspatials to make hunting viable unless the ratters are asleep.
---
I started eve by reading a thread about it on the PBNation forums. I then started following the eve news sites and eventually tried it out.
---
I played for a month or so mining in HS, then just stopped playing (obvious reasons). Then I kept getting emails to resub and I've been here ever since. I really liked using missiles for the graphics of the trails and explosions. Then just started getting into gate camping, etc 
---
Gone for 4 years and still reading and posting here, well the game(s) you play atm must suck!
---
Flying logi in wormhole fleet PVP
---
Started playing, joined fw, shitfitted a firetail and got my first solo 1v1 kill vs some tristan. Heart racing, hands shaking, that's when i got hooked.
---
whatever region has the cutest boys
---
 7,12 $ befor, now 14$  
---
but 1$ equals to 5.80 TRY atm.
---
so 1 month omega cost like 1 day of income, according to my friend in usa he said that it costs him for 1 hours of work. well if you're really fan of this game you can pay but after this point for me nah. and major of turkish community will drop the game too for sure.
---
I think there is an extremely high probability that CCP is much much more likely to "hit" either some poor innocent bastard, including someone who just knew or were just in proximity to a real "operator" or are actually just some small time operator.
---
The real operators will have the knowledge and the resources to get around most anything CCP throws at them.
---
Kinda like the "Drug War" IRL.
---
Aside from the ham handed nerfs they do, the realization they could just ban you arbitrarily causing you to have lost all your time and effort  was one of the reasons I quit over four years ago and am wary of coming back, thereby losing CCP over $1000 in PLEX sales over that time had I still kept playing with just the single account and when I quit I had been considering making an ALT.
---
tl;dr
---
Perfect for asset seizing
---
The people. As toxic as some of you are its why I love you ♥
---
Solitude definitely, jk this place sucks.
---
if you're earning dollar yea, for my friend at usa its like 1 hour of work to pay for 1 month of eve. now in here its 1 day of work. as an example, imagine your beer price went tripled per bottle. would you still buy and drink it?
---
Just lol ;D
---
Unless you're boson ratting in staging and just say "help" in plusten

A balance pass on Tech 3 Cruisers would be nice again. Not a total re-balance just a few tweaks to make them all viable instead of just the Loki (and maybe the legion in some scenarios). The proteus got hit the hardest. In terms of being a hunter it's pretty good since it gets the Scram/Disruptor range bonus however it is really slow.
---
Just put a Basi or Guardian Tandem behind them...
---
Actually no it doesn't or I should say no they don't. Especially since you don't have to worry about arbitrary nerfs, bans and so on.
---
I only started reading and posting here about a week ago. Maybe two.
---
Actually had been deliberately staying away from all things EVE until a vid came up in my Youtube feed. Probably because I was looking at other space games.  
---
I started wondering how things were going and what became of old EVE friends. 
---
Based on zKillboard, either they have gotten a lot better at not getting killed (highly unlikely)  or they aren't out PVPing anymore (highly unlikely) or they like me, quit for whatever reason. Guess which scenario is most likely?
---
This was 2 years ago when I was with them. I was with them for 2 months so I guess things have changed a lot since then. 
---
why
---
Provi is home, nowhere better.
---
There's a few regions. I have a great love for Catch, its the region where I spent the longest in a sov alliance in. There's also Etherium Reach (for the scenery) and Venal (because its so remote and on the edge of the galaxy)
---
What countries are they changing subs for? All Europe? 
---
Black Rise because why not. 
---
Seems really fair imo
---
nearly everywhere except suudi arabia, russia etc.
---
I know bud, I know. Just train into a Loki like everyone else )) 
---
Small scale piracy / solo around lowsec at first then null (we’re talking 2005 where targets were a plenty)
---
you will fly directly to him and then you start orbiting him IF you are fast enough :P
---
I wont say I read all of it. Just too damned long man. 
---
But the overall idea of it resounds with me. I would love if the reinforment timer was set to a certain day. At any point in that day you can hit it again, and then the repair timer starts. This allows for players to adjust their tactics. Granted, this could very easily be exploited by shooting your own structure yourself before the attackers are ready. To circumvent that loophole, the "start back up" armor/hull timer would have to be initiated by the attacking alliance. By that's my worthless 2 cents on a much more complex issue.
---
You will approach the closest outermost edge of your orbit path.
---
Huh, wtf. Obligatory Pear Abyss chat. Still a bargain if it affects me in Scotland, but as you’ve said in another comment, money isn’t as available for everyone. That’s a real bummer, my dude. 
---
You'll burn towards the closest edge of the orbit path in a way that you are on the correct trajectory to continue directly into the orbit.
---
Your ship will approach him until you hit the orbit range, then you will start orbiting. 
---
Of course this information might be too complex for simple minded individuals to understand, so some frustration is understood from individuals with a lack of understanding how the big picture is more important than personal wealth.
---
Just do PI. Guy in my Corp makes enough to plex his account for a month just off of the semi passive income, and then some more isk on the back end for ships. He also grinds combat sites to afford his PVP habits
---
Like we waited for the fozzie sov fix patch.
---
That patch changed a lot and made fozzie sov interesting, fun and complex, r-right?
---
C-R00012
---
Everyone knows his proclivities now
---
A gallente cruiser wreck, Yes an item in my hangar!
---
It kind of amazes me what kind of crap software people will put their financial information into.
---
DED's would still drop faction cruiser/frig BPC's, just not battleship BPC's. Battleships BPC would be seeded like mordus ships in lowsec. Mordus also have LP, but their price stays relatively consistent around 800m for the barghest.
---
People would go lowsec to farm pirate battleships as there is a lot of demand for them, especially if chosen by a doctrine. Which means someone's going to need to start farming them through increased LP costs or by putting more people in lowsec.
---
Not every lowsec is camped by hunters. I've gone through plenty of empty lowsec systems with a large number of belts that you can hunt through to find pirate faction spawns. Or combine them with getting tags+hunting for BPC's would make for a fairly easily/lucrative isk making opportunity for people living in lowsec. Plus this can be done in PvP ships, you don't need a 100mn afk VNI to hunt pirate spawns. I used to do it my pvp battleship to bait hunters and kill their cloaky T3's when they tried to gank you. All the while securing pirate BPC's/loot.
---
As long as you can spam as many rorqs in a site as possible, and the whole gameplay around it is literally afk, the "problem" will not be fixed, as players who already made big investments will just keep on doing the same, because why not its literally free isk while watching movies/series etc
---
PI?
---
OP needs more info....
---
Why not?
---
you scottish? oooo nice
---
i agree but like i told you, instead of earning 7$ now they not gonna earn anything. so whats the point?
---
fleet roam pvp, logistics, and training new players into our alliance was what got me started on the game.  all of that is gone now so i have not played in quite a while :/
---
Paragon Soul...cuz im startded my nullsec game there.
---
B-R00007, it's the place to be my friends.
---
Planetary interaction. They changed the name now to Planetary Production. PP, which just sounds stupid. 
---
Anyway, it's a passive accumulation of products from a planet that can be combined with other planetary products. Theres several videos how to max profit and min time spent.
---
https://youtu.be/XKnObxB9XCs is a simple break down. 
---
I want to kill more people with smart bombs. When I lose my officer bombs which is inevitable, It would be nice to have an alternative is all.
---
Black Rise.   from the lore(Caldari fangirl), to memories.  its where i grew up, and even though i haven't been there in years, i still have a massive collection of ships, POS, and equipment there.
---
He is talking about a recent loss of a ratting titan.
---
Oh, I might have skimmed over that part somehow. I think from a battleship hull cost perspective that you're right: their prices are diminished. It would be good to see a boost to their rarity of drop rate, but consumption also seems to be at an all-time high. Lots of pirate boats fill a space that is used by many alliance-level fights.
---
As for lowsec being unpopulated, yeah, it is quiet in some places, but I'm frustrated that lowsec has become a dump for faction warfare. I wish they'd restore a big portion of lowsec to pre-faction war status. Too much of it exists as an LP farming ground, and pushes out viable occupation.
---
Who is that ? Some sort of :pubbie:
---
Another god post, +1
---
That's why it's so good!
---
I have the best memories of Syndicate.
---
Exactly.  If they were for real and not being a drama queen, they would liquidate a d give it all away.
---
Regardless, even if everyone was updated promptly, you STILL didn't need to be that much of a dick about it. 
---
can someone explain the lack of capital letters?

My current stock should do me until August but yes this is not a welcome change

wow, that's great you can see the bright side.  you definitely made their night!

The old moon rarity scale is obsolete since the reshuffle and switch to manual harvesting. Non-LNS moons contain only common moon ores.
---
Honestly? Cloud ring.

The skybox is simply stunning.
---
Second would be Fountain, because also beautiful.
---
It seems that they cancelled regional pricing and just went flat 15 us dollars and 15 euros. That means every player witch is not from the "west" is gonna have to pony up some more cash. The economic crisis in Turkey is not helping either. For example where I live the minimal wage for 40 hours per month is 3,1 Euro per hour. Drive across the border to Germany and it is almost triple that. So I know your pain.
---
Syndicate. Because Poitot

Would be perfect for the smartbomb Legion, you are anyways dead if you get caught in it.
---
2 cents more
---
The renting systems that are in place now are only another word for protection racketeering. Just without real protection.
---
If an alliance or coalition wants to be progressive, they should 
---
\- provide the systems
---
\- install the iHubs and upgrades
---
\- charge the inhabitants no rent, only **FAIR** and transparent taxes. Taxes on ratting, mining and PI, usage of the stations and the services they provide.
---
Build an identity with which the members identify themselves.
---
What are you on about, the Tengu is still great, its just not horribly overpowered anymore.

What's the problem, he got owned which shows by skill points and super ships doesn't make you good or allow you to win battles. You can buy all the SP you want but you need to learn the ships/fittings, and how to navigate maneuver, use the ships.

it's quite shitty that CCP is giving the shaft to players in those countries, rather than cracking down on people using VPNs to freeload
---
Aye, one of the proud wee blue men o7

yea I feel for you mate, I’d say move over here but maybe see what happens with br*xit first )

long time no see ))

Just attack the structure and see what happens.  It'll go to a timer, if nobody logs in or responds to requests to buy it, clear it.

Yeah, got the same email. Luckily I'm no longer a broke intern, but it's still pretty shitty to do that, especially on very short notice...

From a purely business standpoint, and CCP is a business, answer this:
---
Is it more likely that some Tengu pilot(and other victims of other nerfs) left at the cost of about $20 dollars a month a head because their favorite toy got "damaged" in their eyes 
---
OR
---
Is it more likely than people who either applaud or accept various nerfs ALONG WITH the people whose toys got damaged would have stayed and paid anyway.
---
They do this with other things too. I don't fully understand the POS changes yet, but I get the impression people who were heavily invested in POSes got screwed.
---

I used to own 6 accounts. Paid 1 with RL money and 5 wit isk. But that is when plex was around 1.4 bil. Now i simply don't have the time to grind 11 bil / month just to subscribe, and i can't afford to pay all of them with real money so im kinda in my last days as well.

No.

Look for finnish birds as caldari mostly uses bird refrences for their names

Well it's just some dudes random rankings.  I'd have entirely different list, as would many people.  That's how top lists like this work

Ok, something needs to change then so that it’s not like day one of the kiki being launched

thanks dude. thats exactly what happens atm. i also dont have a proper income, even if i did, its still feels overpriced...

Yeah sure we believe you.

Just go to the new strongest thing instead of living in the past. Adapt, don't whine.
---
For me it was the PvP content in standing fleet when I was in Horde and actually started participating on coms. I had played the game on and off doing solo fw stuff, solo explo in stain, but the game wasn't sticking. Even though I was in Horde at the time, I wasn't on coms/discord. I'd take very long breaks between giving the game another try. 
---
Then I decided to actually participate with the alliance and once I got on coms, roaming gangs would come to 7RM and everyone on coms would drop the chit chat and work together to find and fight the targets. It got me engaged on a whole new level, and actually vocal on coms, calling points and what not. Got to know a group of dudes and looked forward to logging in, talking to some buds, and chasing kills. From there the game really opened up

Ill doi t fer 350.

Should be a buff to artillery damage if we are going by how they are normally fit...
---
Can confirm I feel the same about Dreddit sometimes, but I have a few core friends who make everything worthwhile. Huge corps always have that issue of being very good for doing stuff, but they make it kinda hard to make friends and be heard over everyone else if you’re not super social.
---
&gt; cracking down on people using VPNs
---
how?
---
You can still play in alpha until u you able to afford omega
---
Speculation on the Veles disruptor maybe? It is getting T2 ammo in May. 
---
Dont believe people when they say it is "passive" isk. Its not. The isk per hour invested is capped to a certain amount. Even with 12+ toons doing pi, getting more than 600mil per hour invested is very difficult and will burn you out. 
---
It’s very very cheap for a pirate frig so you can maybe try to just t2 fit a few and make some mistakes. I like to go kitey with it personally. The web keeps people at arms length. When you lose one chat up the person who killed you and talk about the fight. 
---
That would make sense, but all guns not just the veles one have all gone up in price 
---
If you’re in a giant group you need to be in a sig or squad. The sig J3B helped me out a lot and they formed their own corp after the Fountain War.

I remember being in the bacon bar trying to get help my first week playing with no success. Then came back 3 months later and Townsaver was in there, told me to try fcing, make my own content. Was all over from there.
---
How do you propose that be done?
---
Jesus, grow a pair. The Steam price has been kept artificially low for "reasons" for ages. All that's happening is that you're now being asked to pay the NORMAL price.
---
Get a new computer. I haven't had those problems in years and many computers.
---
Some filthy rich wanted to get more filthy rich by cleaning up stocks on market, maybe?

Reckon it’s both related to the run/drop rates in Abyss sites and the popularity of the Kiki.

Faction Warfare circa 2012 when GalMil did our total warzone control push.  I started my first character in 2006, started Rinai in 2007, but only played off and on the next few years. I came back to the game on a whim and found out that my old corp was doing FW.  Had my first real taste of fun lowsec PVP, was part of accomplishing a major goal along with hundreds of other militia dudes, and even got a shiny medal on my character sheet from the President of the Federation!
---
Fast forward to now I've been to fanfest, met several EVE friends irl over the years, and am definitely hooked for good.  Getting to know my corpmates in a meaningful way during a campaign was probably the biggest thing that influenced me to stick around.

That's all I was asking; your writing ability (at least the English bits) left that unclear, including whatever other points you're ranting about.  I do find it mildly interesting that there was/is absolutely no comms from CCP on the matter at all, so I'm curious how you know that you were banned for RMT, but not terribly sanguine about getting a coherent answer.
---
Looking at the market history there is a sharp rise in popularity since December and the market looks quite squishy supply wise. The materials are not rising sharply, tho. Good chance people with BPC will wake up and build them. 
---
Ah alright
---
Do the same in China
---
Is this happening in China too? 
---
Why blame CCP for your countries fucked up monetary problems? Seriously.

"Turkish inflation holds just under 20% in March. Turkey's inflation rate remained a whisker below 20 per cent last month, according to the first major data release since President Erdogan's ruling party ceded control of the capital city amid a challenging economic backdrop."

Solo pvp is what got me addicted. Fleet pvp is fun and all but when I fly solo, it's only me and my skills vs others. Nothing like flying a tanky ship against 10 pilots and trying to take as many down as you can.

Started out with 2 rl friends, one who had been playing a couple of weeks and was in a small HS corp of newbies. Joined them and went to null with them, didn't get on with it so went back to HS (rl friends quit). Started ganking miners in a .5 who were paying local LS pirates next system over for protection. Got ganked by pirates, ganked pirates back, was invited to join pirates. Flying with them got me hooked. Flown with the same core group of friends for years all over the galaxy now.

Literally the best headline in the making, "Turkish man deposes Edrogen, fixes national economy, to make enough money to pay for online video game."
---
good thing 600mil/hr is among the best possible pve income rates
---
I've been looking for one of those
---
From what I've gathered, if there are countries with low prices because their income is lower than that of the US, for example, people in other countries with higher incomes can use VPNs to make it appear that they are from that country and pay less per month in subscription.

Imagine all these Goon Alts

Then again there's really not a lot of ZPC.... 400K units selling doesn't build that much of anything.

I agree, but it’s spiked just now and the kiki has been popular for a while, I’m not sure if ppl stopped running abyssals 
---
should have led with "I don't have any suggestions"

Ships too good at its price point, and we don't want f1 monkeys being able to have fleets of them, so i am making it too expensive for most so my elite null sec gang of guerrilla pilots have life easier

\*Would have
---
Wardec &amp; evemail their CEO for terms. If he's alive and wants to not be wardecced he can get back to you and arrange a sale. 
---
1) which is easier to blame?
---
2) which one of the two parties is easier for OP to reach out to and affect to address the issue?
---
3) are you really blaming an individual for what his political leader has brought upon him?
---
4) you're an idiot
---
The people I know who ran abyssals only did so when they first came out, some of them do the frigs or pvp now but most are back to making money other ways. I’ve never tried them myself, and I’m not part of the abyssal community, so I couldn’t say to be honest. 
---
Would be worth looking at the historical numbers of bpcs and parts being put on sell orders I guess. 
---
Why I should know it? Why CCP does not telling me that? They say nothing. They just ignore everything!
---
Google it. 
---
Actually, on second thoughts definitely never google it unless you wanna go on a goverment list of very special boys.
---
Western normal.
---
I suggest you read up on inflation, exchange rates and how much an average inhabitant of a country makes /mo.
---
All that's happening is that you don't have the required knowledge to justify even having an opinion in the matter.
---
Others have said, bash at your earliest convenience.
---
Scan it with a data analyzer module, go through the hacking and find out the reinforce time (+/- 2 hours) and you must kill the shields/armor (one run because it's in low power) at least 5.5 days before the reinforce time, otherwise it's that time the week after costing two wardecs.
---
I did a 4 structure solo bash this way but got caught out by the 5.5 days bit.  I'd recommend a Leshak with decent skills for solo.
---
Provi. Very easy to get kills there as the locals are shit.
---
ok, so how do you stop this?
---
I'm not reading this many words because there's like 20 posts a day like this daily and all of them have never heard of the word "brevity"
---
1. Don't allow people to buy gametime in cheap currencies using a payment method that's not identifiably from that country.
---
2. Do whatever analytics Valve does to ban offenders -- using VPNs to abuse regional pricing is a quick way to lose your Steam account, so they've got ways. Heck, eve is on steam now. If CCP can't handle this job themselves, they could offload it by offering regional pricing through steam.
---
3. Start blocking connections to the game from commercial VPN company endpoints. There are legit reasons to use a VPN to play eve, but that's vastly outnumbered by the bot abuse.
---
4. Run some occasional sales that aren't focused purely on Plex.
---
Killing is just a means of communication
---
Not if you have 5 or more accounts. 
---
Can I get a TL;DR?
---
Did you know there is only one named system in that region?
---
If you play 3 hours a day, dedicate 1 week out of the month to only farm then making 2bil is pretty easy
---
Why not undock and practice? Why not try this and see? why post on reddit for an answer when trying it yourself will take less time and you will learn better? 
---
Thanks Obama
---
Can’t you just have 1 account?
---
A man of culture I see. Head pats I hope.
---
They don’t use calsuleers so it also makes sense that they would create every edge possible.
---
Guess again. You people are just butthurt cos you've had a cheap run and it's over now. If you don't like this totally valid opinion, you have the option to ignore it rather than getting all twatty.

Spend inordinate amounts of money playing whack a mole with VPNs.

Or just charge a standard rate in a few developed economies.

It's not particularly shocking that CCP went with the cheaper option and is willing to lose some low end paying customers.

It wouldn't have really made much of a difference now would it?

yep black desert's company, which is greedy af...

well can i do that with a vni?

It's an Ice planet 100%, not sure if it's an Ice Dwarf or I just got trolled by the EVESterdam stream claiming it was.

The one on the left looks like a toilet from the side. Just saying.
---
i used to run 4/10s with my gila, so thats about 600 dps with t2 hammerheads ( i didnt bother using my missiles) and it died just fine.
---
just pre-align if you're worried about tank, none of the rats point.
---
Well I'm my mind slow is ineffective.  If you're going out c3ing you can solo in a 700+ dps Loki for about 500-600m. The faster you run sites the more isk/hour and the lest you are exposed. 
---
This is not a 4/10, this is [Serpentis Secrets](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Serpentis_Secrets). I run 4/10s in my Confessor though and those are a cinch.
---
This. The multi account culture in Eve needs to DIAF.
---
tinypic? wtf is that shit
---
The post does make several suggestions.
---
It suggests that game mechanics should have a specific attribute to enable organic development of conflict across time zones (alignment of player incentives).
---
It suggests a previous sovereignty mechanic had this attribute (POS sov) and discusses how it aligns player incentives to encourage direct engagement on approximately equal terms.
---
It suggests that mechanics which align player incentives in this way are a general solution which can be applied in other areas of the game where mechanics currently reach non-confrontation as a natural conclusion.
---
In suggesting these things the post directly outlines a class of specific mechanics.
---
It is not difficult to conceive specific mechanics that fall in the outlined class, but it would be contrary to the aim of emphasizing alignment of player incentives is the key and specific features of mechanics other than this are unimportant.
---
Grinding will be required. But dont put a time limit on it. Alpha one month omega the second month.  U get to fly real cheap fits and ships during alpha. Make the best out of sh!t situation
---
It’s not cheap for them relative to where they live and their income. So what happens now is a bunch of people stop playing which is shit for everyone in Eve. 
---
You ignorant fuck. 
---
its cheap for you mate, not for me.

Here's your answer. [Same](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=usdrub) happened with russian ruble subs in 2014/2015.
---
It's not CCP it's Steam and it's really the EU 
---
Yes imperium snuff pet pls gib spod 
---
Easy, you VNI rat in Delve with your goon buddies. Isn't that what everyone does?
---
This is correct, with the specialization trained the t2 drones pull ahead on damage. They're definitely worth training into, but if you're losing drones a lot you might benefit more from the increased ehp on faction drones.
---
Venal, it's pretty calm, good for small gang pvp with not many super/titan droping on you
---
This is not just CCP saying screw the other countries This is a EU mandate going after places like Steam that Geo-lock prices. 
---
yo yo yo,
---
steam is doing this since ages, so everyone can have their games with reasonable prices.
---
so instead of having no customer from a country, they lower the price and have more customers, simple is that. it might sounds cheap for you guys but i like to inform that im not having my income as dollar or euro. and you cant imagine damn taxes here.
---
for 3 years, i payed for my subs, never bought plex. but after this poing since ccp dont care i dont care either.
---
before it was like a mid restaurant meal + drink price. like hamburger + cola(%30 expensive then burger kings biggest menu) in a mid range restaurant or 2 cinema ticket. now its much more...
---
https://youtu.be/FQRW0RM4V0k
---
yet this game needs a level of brain and iq level to play, its interesting that people dont understand how things work...
---
Everytime I see Venal my mind reads it as Venereal, which then leads me to trying to figure out if it's where space STDs come from...
---
So, if i'm reading this right, your mad over having to pay the same as everyone else?

This is one of my all time favorite EVE vids, still have a bunch of the music on my Spotify and it gets me hyped whenever they come on. I, for one, would very much love a sequel.

alright well taking into account your resists the rat deals about 290 dps to you and reps around 675-700 dps against your damage type.
---
detorid atm, the tears there taste good and salty

---
First step, move to null or wspace, you can train up your other two toons to do it within 20-30 days, grab a star pack if you want to start a alt, use the MPTCs to train all three at the same time.

I really need to do that tbh. I have my friends that I do stuff with all the time, but beyond that I only really go on Corp fleets. I don’t fc or do anything public really. I feel like I still need to learn the game more before I get into that, but maybe it’s worth just jumping in.

As a player i want this (and especially plex from game events) but also don't know if it would be good for the game i mean messing with plex  can change more than we think. And it's no business for CCP to do this, well probably it could be good for them but first they need great NPE that will keep newbies and great advertising for game and events (and i still think that long SP campaign with especially great well telled story which sci-fi fans love would make miracles for NPE numbers) 
---
well im pretty new on exploration, because im bored from turning around on rocks with vni, so how fast can i get with exploration? like average?
---
Misspelled it you illiterate native
---
blow it out your arse casual
---
Duh, just like everywhere else, you press F1 to activate artillery.
---
It's not just Turkey that had its prices hiked up massively, it's every other region that had relatively cheap sub prices compared to the US. I'm having to pay triple what I did originally if I want to continue my sub, which I probably won't for most of my accounts. Imagine paying $15/month for an MMO and then suddenly the prices goes up to $45. It's just ridiculous. They already closed the "cheap PLEX" loophole a few years back but kept the cheap sub prices and now they've fucked with both, pricing it out a lot of their player base.
---
ok that's what I thought. It'd gonna be dicey lol.
---
Curse is well located and has NPC stations.
---

Because I have no reason except this one. Reason "RMT" is unique for CCP. You want ban and have no reason? Ok - it will be "rmt".

Also I never heard other reasons of bans except 'RMT'.

I forgot about that pod, lol!
---
Esoteria because reasons

You can, but you cannot change login name.
---
And deny yourself of most of the content in EVE? Even the shittiest wormhole corp needs more than 1 account to function, unless you want to force your corpmates to do the majority of the legwork for you. In nullsec, maybe you could survive with just one account but you'd lock yourself out from most content that involves some of the most fun in EVE, namely capital escalations and counter-escalations. You'd be stuck in your shitty subcap while everybody else is logging in their dreads and supers to haze the enemy.
---
Yeah you can tell there's a massive Nazisism mindset on this sub. Hopefully things get better for you irl for you to come back.

you have a decent armor buffer so even if your reps arent holding it'll be a long grind for the rat, you should be able to outlast it.

There are six total infrastructure hubs in The Spire as of the time of my post. Four are owned by Lazerhawks, who (to the best of my knowledge) are opposing Brothers of Tangra and their allies in this conflict. The Spire has 72 solar systems.

For those who aren't aware of ihub mechanics, ihubs are what enable the respawning of the mining and ratting anomalies in a nullsec system. They are, other than moon mining, the primary reason to rent space in the first place. Renting a system with no ihub is basically setting money on fire for no reason.

Steam is the largest games seller in the world and their entire business model is as a publisher and operates internationally as a point of sale. It's not free to police this or integrate with global financial services in a way to handle it.
---
CCP is a relatively small studio that develops a game in a country with an extremely well developed economy. "Steam can do it" is a pretty dumb response. Like I don't want to be a dick, but at a certain point, most local currencies aren't worth the hassle to deal with once you get chargebacks and users VPNing to take advantage. The lost income and opportunity cost isn't zero, and apparently wasn't worth the complications anymore.

I go back to the same spot, That's all.

J space is best space, no doubt about that. It is not a friendly place for new bros or inactive corps though. That said there are a number of new player friendly wh corps that can get you started, such as whsoc and pospey perhaps. And I think eve uni may still have a wh campus? Not sure about that.

Just for you.
---
POS sov had the property of aligning player incentives in a specific way which not only avoided the need for timezone awareness in the sovereignty mechanics but actively maneuvered gameplay towards direct engagement on equal terms.
---
No sov system since then has had this property and as a result direct engagement on equal terms occurs much less frequently.
---
If CCP were to design new sovereignty mechanics or adapt existing mechanics to emphasize this property again, the mechanics would no longer need to incorporate timezone awareness and would encourage direct engagement on equal terms.
---
It should also be possible to align player incentives in this way to resolve the tendency towards non-confrontation in other contexts of the game.

You can fly caps with 1 account and supers with 2

Yep pretty much exactly that.

Just out of curiosity...why the number 30b? Is that what you have in ISK? It's not a bad start if it is. I bet if you invested that in the market you could make it grow exponentially. Just my 2 cents.

Some people do have a social lives or lo and behold, they go to work. Leave the house you know. Still don´t wanna pay for X multiaccounts, don´t have the time to grind. Does that make them casual? Maybe most of them. All of them? No. But keep riding that elitist train and keep playing with your multiaccounts and disregard that an MMO needs a certain playerbase to function healthily, it´s okay. 
---
What’s the second account do on a super?
---
Speaking for TEST idk about other entities but you are required to have a FAX alt.
---
Why?
---
what if you found a more efficient way to make isk
---
:thinking:
---
mandatory fax alt
---
Because of repping power, you can’t jump supers and not have enough faxes to rep them
---
There's a purge coming. Don't look Nidia in the eye.
---
Can’t the faxes be flow by other players?
---
I don't get it. Can anyone explain this to me? 
---
Because if you take other people to fly faxes you take them out of other useful roles like flying dreads,carriers or any subcapital ship and also you can’t always expect to have the faxes needed if you depend on other people
---
It's the option of choice for corp CEOs who want to make the move to nullsec without losing control of the corp. Most can't meet the bar for independent membercorp.
---
All other dreads are taking a damage nerf to HAW guns and when the siege mod is active they get a 100% damage bonus to HAW guns bringing them back up to the normal damage. For phoenix's they made the change by increasing the cycle time on the torp launchers and the siege mod is supposed to cut your cycle time in half, so when you siege mod is active after the changes it should be dealing the same amount of damage as it does now. It could be this just wasn't implemented correctly on SISI.
---
So its better to limit your number of super caps than have people fly faxes instead of sub caps?
---
If you have the ISK for a super/titan then you should have the isk for a fax alt.
---
Also fax alts are cheap I’ve got mine for around 21 bil + 2bil for the ship so that’s 23bil one time investment which nowadays is not much tbh
---
honestly we all know that they ask too much money for the shit they give us. this game is good from and idea perspective but it's been managed to shit and beyond in all the years.
---
How do you get that much isk in the first place?
---
Someone help a newbro understand, why is this revolutionary (sincerely the guy who all of your smartbombing gatecamps kills)
---
i dont know if anyone else has noticed, but it seems to me theres diminished returns on doing sites now? could just be rngsus i guess. 
---
Great video, I even managed to spot myself cyno in, bump, siege, and float 130 km away in the nag. 
---
An ESS producing them would only empower large groups.
---
PLEX is better off as an isk sink, which could be used to keep the prices of plex from climbing too high. Buy PLEX from concord, or from players that got it however. 
---
Wtf I hate pgl now.
---
To be fair, if you decide to join a bloc alliance you are probably happy with being treated as a drone?

You need to deal at the very least, 690 dps in kinetic or thermal to break his tank, but unless you can sig tank him you will struggle to tank. 
---
Don't forget about their thousand or so bot miners. 
---
Polarized weapons do more damage but reduce all of your resistances  to 0. Smartbombs are AoE (and friendly-firing) weapons, so slapping one of these on would give you more damage but be dangerous if you tried more than one ship.
---
Would be cool if they stopped kill EVE. The big alliances are all huge whinebags that bemoan any positive change the game could get and forces CCP to keep things most adventageous for them. 
---
Not really. Playing alpha is too limiting, just too shitty. The only thing I really do on my alpha is marketing, any actual gameplay I need to have omega otherwise it is just no fun and not worth it.
---
Figuratively what you would get for an officer mod

Nah it's a champion in League of Legends, I think his taunt is "A fool and his head are easily parted"
---
If PL took a page out of PGL's book you could probably get enough people in fleet to kill a [Dread](https://youtu.be/uoJ2sWedx6k?t=2650)
---
we did sacrafice 3 carriers to you, thou, they were all supposed to be unfitted  :(.
---
for the glory of the empire :)
---
It varies from a few hundred mil for an officer to 75b or more if you get certain things.
---
As others mentioned, you should be ok. The strategy mentioned in the article is worth taking into consideration as lots of higher unrated complexes are not deadspace. If you do try it out let us know what it dropped.
---
woah someone leaked the no_leaks channel how dare they!!!
---
even 2 or 3 seem way more reasonable, Paying for 1 and plexing 1-2 is pretty manageable even at ~2bil
---
Don't forget that Mrs. Largebody still needs your rent iskies, tia.

What are some (relatively) safe PVE activies for an Alpha player to practice in a battleship?
---
Returning after like 5 years, bought a Raven and fitted it excited about running high sec level 4 security, clicked the agent, L4 requires Omega. /facepalm. Where can I fly my new Raven without too much pvp risk? I can afford to lose it no prob, but I want to go shoot stuff for practice since I haven't played in 5 years. I've been doing l3's in a drake for a few days and loved it. It seems like everything in high sec is too small for a battleship?
---
Killboard green brah.

Line members are fucking dumb mindless F1 Monkeys. They're right to be ignored

The notice the EU sent out specifically ruled against locking out purchases made inside the EU, not anywhere in the world. IE someone in France buying a code from Poland, not from Turkey.
---
its about 1 year ago exactly the same thing was happening in the north west, good times
---
Three alliances who killed your butt many times are now joining forces, resources, intel, isks. Guess how much hell highsec will be seeing very soon. Hahaha..... run while you can. And thank CCP for it. 
---
wow i &lt;3 pgl now

Snitches get stitches

I never said LP, but being able to convert concord LP into plex would cause large price fluctuations, seeing as that LP is used for many other items. Probably not the best idea
---
I mean, PGL is a dude I play a spaceship game with, he's not my dad.
---
I don't care if he cares about me or not.
---
You misspelled ppl

my country have srong pain for racials you would be jail getting rape newb
---
best
---
Tenerifis: It's kind of a garbage region overall but the sheer amount of fun and frags CENTI had last year was the best 6 months I've ever had playing this game.
---
What's the lore for black rise? Hold me gently and tell me the story
---
my country have strong racials law you would have jail raped and like more
---
What the fuck are you doing in a marauder without bastion? Fit a damn bastion module, not only does it make immune to EWAR, it additionally gives you a bonus in range and tracking. Also if you are using a paladin for missions, use its MJD bonus to kill the rats from 100km.
---
Yeah, your country is an economic quagmire with a self-inflicted currency crisis due to a corrupt authoritarian dictator. Enjoy a future of nation wide poverty, underdevelopment, and inflation *combined* with economic recession.
---
When you have a *great leader* that has [no idea](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/turkish-lira-crisis-erdogan-interest-rates-2018-8?r=US&amp;IR=T) how interest rates work, even believes high interest rates [*cause* inflation](https://www.ft.com/content/b5a4cadc-9ee8-11e8-85da-eeb7a9ce36e4) (lol) and is politely described as
---
&gt; a man of highly unorthodox economic views
---
—which by the way is how nice people say that he has no idea what he's doing—then you shouldn't be surprised that you find yourself holding on to a currency that is becoming increasingly worthless. Interest rates nearing 20% only come about through horrible ecomic mismanagement. Even if your country still accepts monopoly money you shouldn't expect the rest of the world to do so.
---
Get out.
---
Alternatively, have fun living in a shit-tier, underdeveloped, 3rd-world-looking country, with a standard of living a fraction of the west exclusively because you're stuck with corrupt, trash-tier leadership.
---
Townsaver had me fc with almost 0 knowledge of the game. Was one of my first fleets. Ended up doing kitchen sink roams every day. Actually have a call out thread on the test forums where I saved a carrier with my shitty kitchen sink fleet as a newbie. Look up Philip Montagna on the test forums. This was 6 years ago.
---
That would make large alliances even stronger relative to smaller tryhard groups
---
how many hours of roaming do you have to go through to find these targets?
---
Proteus is kinda fucked. It has only 1 viable role, that is using it as cloaky scram. Otherwise its tank sucks, its DPS outside of point blank blasters sucks, it uses too much cap to be a good PvE boat and if you go drones on it it fuckign really sucks cause of the too low drone DPS bonus and/or only enough bandwidth for 4 heavies. On top of that its just too slow when tanked.
---
It just gets outdone in just about every single function by many different ships. You might find it some niche in some armor WH somewhere but then you can armor tank a HAM Loki or go Legion and be better too.
---
Makes me sad too as I am an original Gallente player and Proteus was my 1st T3C, holds a special spot for me.
---
Amen
---
Tengu is still OK though, its tank is still good, it still has enough options to get a nice slot layout to balance everything out, only thing I don't like about it is its kinetic bonus. I'd rather have it cut down by half but be applicable to all missiles then just kinetic. This is where to me Loki surpasses it the most.
---
Fuck snitches. This is bullshit.
---
Small Gang Solo Hero Logi
---
Wow I haven't played in a while, but one Machariel used to cost two PLEX worth of ISK. 
---
Crazy to think you can now buy six for the price of one PLEX.
---
Haven't stations been destroying GPUs for a long time now? For the 3 years I've been playing anytime I am in a station my GPU usage always instantly shoots up to 100% and stays pegged to 100% until I undock.
---
And that's with somewhat potato settings.
---
yikes
---
TIL water is wet.
---
Well played, friends.
---
Lasers. Why are their tracking the worst on paper? It uses caps, I don't know how to read their DPS, the only thing I find unique is optimal range control, and no reloads (but solopvp ends before reloading anyways, and limited PVE damage)
---
Pill me, what's good about lasers?  People recommending me to fly a merlin or gallente, but I just wanna get into amarr.
---
Because I kinda wanna try to figure out my own fit and try to short range-in-the-face brawl solo pvp, but with lasers.
---
Sorry for my terribly newbie question.
---
Or something.
---
fuck you i spit out my coke at the carrier literally asleep at the keyboard lmao
---
Lol raknor got farmed with harpies
---
Yeah CCP!  Make the rats fight rats anytime and any place.
---
Give us the sentence before - what actually was it PGL didn't care about line member's views on?
---
Nidia already has a superiority complex don’t feed him
---
Jokes on them. My kink is being called a f*g and brainless. Thanks guys
---
It's steams argument by forcing us to do this we are just going to make it equal to everyone screw it why put effort into making prices different depending on economic areas and policing it when we can cut all of that cost out and and just say fuck it same price as high income western countries for everyone.
---
It should ready.  “You have 12600 spy’s and 1 member.”
---
When ?
---
No we don’t use them either
---
Or “you have 12600 alts and 1 member”
---
you *can* fly any ship with just one account, you're free to fly supers without a fax alt, or a cyno alt, or a sitter. Why would you do this however is the real question, and that applies to really any cap or any role in the game actually.
---
The best thing about lasers? The fact that an Oracle can produce 880 DPS at 65 kilometers with Scorch, thus outperforming virtually any other ship of the same size or smaller in the game. Scorch in general has both great damage and range, which means you don't have to worry about switching ammo too often - it just works in every situation. But if you want to, then lasers indeed provide the most versatile solution in terms of optimal range control. 
---
That said, I wouldn't go with lasers for short range. What you are describing is blasters - for example this [proteus](https://imgur.com/YDdB5GD), generating 850 DPS at melee range while also sustaining a respectable tank of over 1,000 EHP/s. 
---
If you insist on brawling with lasers, try an active 10MN Phantasm - they take a lot of bling to really hit their stride, but they're very formidable once there. The AB bonus means you have a tiny sig but keep a good speed, and the shield booster bonus complements your sig tank with a strong local tank as well, for example: [this fit](https://imgur.com/Epg1XbF)
---
Its a battlehip rat. Get under its guns. Any plain old 900+ DPS Gila can do it with faction DDAs and Augmented hammers. You don't need so much HP/s. Just fit active so you don't blow up your sig on all extenders and whatnot and use faction or deadspace AB, overheat it for 2-3 cycles when you are spiraling in. Don't come at it in a straight line, angle or curve in retaining around 270-290 transversal. Another words any of the T4 T5 active Abyss fits can do it and you might even be able to take out the battery or cap rig and put something else in there cause you don't have full neut spawns to deal with.
---
You can also do it in a HAM Loki, either armor or shield flavor, HAM Tengu and Ishtars will eat this thing for breakfast as well. Vedmak, Drekavac too.
---
I don't know but I assume it is something to do with making his members defend 18 jammers for 12 hours
---
It’s gone on like this for a few years so I think it’s fine
---
"FC did you say strip?" -one of the carriers
---
Great video, had a laugh at the panic spam jumping.
---
Is there a genre/name for these types of videos? Where memes and shit are used at the prefect moments?
---
Not just eve videos but there are tons of them for almost every popular game.
---
I've personally dubbed them "over edits" but that doesn't get me much on YouTube.
---
some things never change
---
Ahhh, I really dont want to use hybrids. but I knew it gonna be the premier brawling weapon.
---
Okay, if I fly amarr, so I need to kite then?
---
Also, web vs tracking enhancers. Should I stack webs, or should I stack tracking enhancers? How should I approach turret tracking problems? Many instances I just cant hit what I'm aiming.
---
2 guys drunk and clowning around and its takes so many to take them down. Damn Goons so rich!
---
Yeah after playing with the bastion and mjd it's amazing. I stopped playing right after I got my marauder and just came back; didn't even know what mjd or bastions were. Im doing missions in .6 space so I get a little freaked out being a sitting duck after activating the bastion. :P
---
&gt; well i came from Star Trek Online. the thing i HATED was that in star trek. ALL THE TURRET LASERS COME FROM 1 PIXEL ON THE SHIP.
---
I honestly never even noticed that and I loved running full beamboats.
---
The one thing I hated about STO was the shit performance with the shit CPU/GPU utilization as well as the usually constant rubber banding.
---
I quit STO shortly after the release of Delta Rising, because client performance was so god awful.
---

---
Actually taking away regional pricing helps to prevent botting and hacking in games. 
---
Due to bothers and hackers picking up copies with Vpn and it's cost effective even if they get caught. 
---
With the copits of games costing more they can't just spam buy anymore.
---
I agree, but I don’t really thing horde is the biggest cause of this by a long shot. 
---
hahahaha, is this a new dinobot?
---
Provi if you want to get murdered every time you undock
---
I wonder how Legacy members feel being crammed into immensea, not allowed to mine or rat in their home space, while TEST members sit in Esoteria.
---
Service guarantees citizenship 
---
what does this have to do with eve online?
---
Years ago when I started I was driven to end up doing the "big battles" and the big alliances. Unfortunately, even back then we already had a prelude to the multiboxing, botting, required alts etc. and as they shifted more and more in that direction and I got pressured into it I realized what actual total shit they are. It was akin to some sort of a cult member like an evangelical or something waking up from slumber, truly an elightening moment.
---
Then I took a break from the game, when I came back I joined a small corp, small nomadic alliance, lived in WH for just a little while but it wasn't my thing, and small corps were already starting to die off for the reasons which we currently have, they jsut weren't as bad at that time yet.
---
2 and a half years later most of people I played with quit due to beign fed up with the general direction the game was heading in. More multiboxing, more bots, more utter shit.
---
The last time I came back was just for novelty, there is some new content I wanted to check out and this time stay largely solo. I did the PvE bit that I never did before. Ran epic arcs, did all the lore shit, etc., ran all the different site types, did some explo and am still doing some Abyss here and there. But on the PvP front my 2 characters are only activated when certain people log and we feel like playing together a bit in which is fairly rare and even then its kinda shitty now due to a combination of lack of content and content denial mechanics.
---
So believe it or not, the thing that is keeping me in the game, is actually the new PvE. The other aspects of it have died out for me.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/eve/wiki/rules
---
&gt; Any type of fundraising is not allowed on /r/eve. The exception is if it's run by CCP
---
I understand that it sucks when your currency goes backwards, but it's hard to be too sympathetic about someone not being able to get half price subscription any more. It costs CCP just as much to serve content to you as it does to me in the UK - why should you get that content for half the price.
---
&gt; Also I never heard other reasons of bans except 'RMT'. 
---
Well then allow me to be helpful by pointing out [this](https://community.eveonline.com/support/policies/suspension-and-ban-policy/)
---
Agreed. All theroycraft here regardless.
---
Think of it this way - a web also gives you the benefit of a tracking computer (you hit more easily), while simultaneously giving you range control and defensive options. I would always go for a web if I had a spare mid slot like that, unless I'm fitting a ship that's supposed to engage at ranges where a web will never be relevant. 
---
As for tracking in general, there are two ways you can improve your chances to hit a target in every situation. The first is increasing distance - the DPS formula factors angular velocity into your hit chance, and angular velocity is reduced the farther away you are. That's why the Oracle I mentioned can actually score hits - even though its tracking is only 4.55, it's shooting from 60km away, at which point everything is essentially standing perfectly still. 
---
The other way is what we call 'transversal-matching'. Put simply, it means moving in the same direction as the opponent, and the same velocity. If you manage that, no matter how fast both of you are moving, you will be standing still relative to each other. You can accomplish this by either trying to anticipate where they are going, or simply burning away from them and forcing them to chase you. 
---
I like how the TL;DR is too long and I'm not gonna read it.

Tbh ISK accumulation in a null bloc with a reimbursement policy is fairly easy if you're an active player and invest time in one of the moderate-to-high ROI activities like L5s, pirate L4s, market activity, etc.
---
The hardest money to make in EVE is that first bil. Everything after that comes easier than the last.
---
Welcome, friend. o7

lmao dude it's 5 fucking sentences
---
At this point why are you even browsing a discussion site?  You might find something like Youtube more your speed, they have moving pictures and shit
---
Is water wet though?
---
Saw an ad, went to the website, looked at ships, then found the lore. Read all the chronicles.
---
All of them
---
Then I was hooked - made a couple of trials before committing, and haven't looked away since~
---
I know at least in my Corp the few dudes who recorded with comms either ended up with shit quality comms or are still working on editing vOv   It was a very exciting 10 minutes 
---
they did eventually add ships where beams showed up on different parts of the ship. but never got turrets.

Winning with style

Respect
---
I don't blame any one person or group, either. Pandemic Horde are making content the best way they know how and, for them and their members, it's probably fun. 
---
But EVE is a big place and in order for it to survive, these massive groups of players need to stop oppressing everybody who isn't with them. They need to relax, step back and look at what their behavior is causing across New Eden, not just that they're secure and happy in their territory.
---
Turkey isn't in the EU you fucking melon.
---
Imagine caring what some autistic Mayo man who takes eve seriously enough to still be playing in 2019 thinks
---
In J space at least a low power structure is fair game for anyone.
---
What has the EU got to do with Turkey?
---
What are L5s
---
Guess what things that happen with the EU kind of can effect other things you know
---
"Wordless" communication...using words.
---
wut?
---
i don't think we needed to see that shit getting podded
---
I will be leaving EVE for quite some time. Should I put all my ISK into PLEX to preserve its value?
---
Because their labour is worth half the price. Regional pricing is a thing for most things.
---
Getting your point across in a concise way that's not annoying to for your target audience to parse is a skill. Lean it. 
---
someone posts something about pl having a hard time killing a dread and your response is "nuh uh, pl can kill dreads" with a link showing pl following a competent alliance around killmailwhoring on their kills?
---
probably pretty good, immensea seems like an alright place to live right now
---
Tapi 2019 is getting to goon 2016 levels of bullshitting their line members.
---
Sounds Persian to me. Zar from sar (meaning chief - one of the possible origins of the Slavic tsar/czar) and mazd from mazda (wisdom). Sounds like a decent name for a healer. Not directly Slavic but close enough.

Thank you so much, these tips has been an eye opener.

He's just waiting to blap the winner.

okay first of all who are you implying is competent
---
Closing the hole was a really good move. It halved the attackers numbers, and the 2:1 ratio made sure Snuff would actually jump in. Provi's FCs are getting smater.
---
It's an excellent hunting preserve for sure
---
Renters will not pay! Just move away!
---
You're calculating theoretical dps of you standing still in his optimal. Transversal makes a huge difference in incoming damage. His optimal is massive so orbit him close with an AB. 
---
you handled this well, gj!
---
It should be clear to line members without being said. Leadership hoards all the money making moons. Finds any reason not to pay full SRP
