ok, i see your point, and it might be true to a certain degree,e specially with super-remote areas like Cobalt Edge/Omist/Paragon Soul/Period Basis , but you a) always have wormholes and b) there HAVE been residents at some point that only had maybe 1-2 hundred characters, so relatively small. i also don't expect 5 man groups to become powerful when sandwiched between goons and test, but that wasn't really the point. we have so many regions (for example fade, tribute, fountain, vale of the silent, insmother, cache, etc) that are rented out where people COULD live very well with decent (enough) logistics and sometimes even npc null close or within the region sa a safety blanket and without being completely sandwiched/hopeless. maybe the 95% number was a bit too high and i see your criticism, but i think it only applies to the real remote regions.

The inside of what? Software development or botting? If you're implying that there's a lot of demand for botting software that waits till the enemy decloaks to respond, I think you're wrong.
---
No dude I'm asking that we don't have a castle and moat in every god damn system.
---
Kudos on a good, honest, and balanced review.
---
Well, as anyone in my alliance can tell you, I pretty much don't rat at all, never found enjoyment in the activity and what's the point of playing a game if you don't enjoy what you do.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
goons...hahahaha....wait you're serious? Let me laugh harder. \~HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\~  
---
Don’t listen to this man...we’re just a few systems from t1 and getting rich. Stay in Immensea until the VNI hits 150m. 
---
Build more catapults.
---
It’s the eve version of Scientology
---
Taking that flair tag a little too seriously lol
---
What exactly is factually incorrect with what he posted?
---
But not as wholesome.
---
It says a lot when the pve is so boring people would rather spend money then play the game 
---
Did we RF the azbel?  I honestly don't know I haven't checked up on it yet
---
Because money comes from long-term subs, not newbies?
---
Can a bhaal x up in fleet please.
---
&gt;You can already just drop a million drones around the gate so that no cloaking near it is possible. Combine that with bubbles and nothing but a ceptor is getting through
---
I thought that's been an exploit for years and years.
---
&gt;Also Horde was only handed a cut of the profits, TEST gets the full pie, no greedy middleman. Profits that looking at the horde SRP eather dried up or never really went to horde.
---
Lol what SRP? Horde has only ever given SRP for stratops that they deem to be important enough. They even recently got rid of their blanket HIC SRP.
---
Do the maths, Horde had control of highsec for well over a year at a significantly higher tax rate than TEST and they would have made at the very least a couple of trillion isk from it alone. So where exactly did all that isk go? 
---
Infrastructure? Lol.
---
SRP? Lol.
---
Maybe it went to all the shared accounts that their directors seem to use like that bridge rangarok for one. Or maybe that's just a guy who plays 24/7, spent all the isk to inject and buy a titan, and doesn't use that titan for anything but bridging. Both are equally likely possibilities.
---
EVOL predates EVE
---
No one cares
---
I wonder why?
---
lol i'm not even in test
---
This is a bug with wardecs -- when someone renews a wardec while it's still in active cooldown, the defenders should come along and be able to keep fighting, or quit and continue the cooldown as it was. Hopefully CCP continues to patch system as stuff like this is discovered.
---
But if y'all 100% wanted to fight you could make it happen. Instead phorde is dripping out azabels with altcorps, same as goons and test did back when phorde controlled the perimeter market. (Which is also stupid because you can't achieve the same endgame.)
---
Yeah, but your long term subs eventually quit or die and then you need the newbies to sub long term. New player retention. They've got the vets in already

tfw you had 60,000 friends and gave them up because it wasn't elite enough
---
thats categorically wrong,

But idiots do.
---
I don't get it.
---
I’ll trade a slightly used CEO for that. 
---
'To the tapi cunts that did this: grow some nuts ya fucken cheating pussies.'
---
When you ping this out with a straight face when you did it multiple times to avoid fights against TEST lmao.
---
Trade you an abyssal tobias scra....oh wait cant roll that yet
---
Too bad CCP wouls still lose a race against a snail.
---
Horde could just wardec TEST itself, like how TEST wardecs Horde itself.
---
Because I i haven't done one and want to do one.
---
no

Congratulations, you don't understand PLEX or the economy.  PLEX does not effect the ability to have multiple accounts running VNIs or Rorquals. 
---
Not
---
One
---
Bit
---
I have had multiple VNI accounts long before I ever used a single PLEX.  Multiple VNI accounts are not even a problem.  The core reason that supers and titans are so cheap (which is a better economic indicator than PLEX) is that ore is so cheap.  This is caused by Rorquals hoovering up ore, causing the price to plummet.  PLEX has zero to do with Rorquals.  You can fly several of them and never once put down PLEX.  Especially if you got in early when ore was at least somewhat profitable to mine.  
---
The other main bottleneck in prices of items is still PI.  Those prices are not bottoming out because the method of extraction is largely unchanged over the years.  
---
Rorquals also are mining Moon Goo, which has caused a massive drop in the prices of those items (along with market manipulation by Aryth).  
---
Not a single one of those examples are effected by the cost of PLEX.  PLEX does not control the cost of ships, ore does.  Once you realize this, you will have a better understanding of why things are priced the way that they are.
---
Nah, whenever you do that some dude reports it to CCP claiming 'lag'. They get deleted in short order and if CCP can figure out who was behind it they might issue a warning. However if you do the same thing with Titans it's fine, and not even ceptors can get through.
---
lol welcome to the new age of eve/titans online... If you were really gone for 2 years CCP killed the game with injectors. It's just slowly bleeding out at this point. 
---
You chimp more than HydeX - and that's a high bar
---
Oh hey, just like you did lmbo
---
If the Azbel was in Horde, TEST can't do this because then TEST can't shoot the structures. 
---
This is the reason why the Perimeter keepstar is in TEST alliance itself, so that it ensures who ever decs to shoot the keepstar will always be able to be attacked by TEST.
---
Horde however puts Azbels outside of horde, because they've been making sure it's as difficult as possible to shoot the Azbels. 
---

Pretty much every station has a LP store of the owning corp, don't see where the confusion would come from.
---
That would lower the price of plex
---
Now you're just spouting nonsense and using arguments that you are literally making up, there's really nothing I can say other than that.
---
&gt; Most small gang people don't want to make content, they want content handed to them

current small gang players are part of the ones who put by far more effort to find content, probably second to super hunters, what are you talking about

what kind of retarded shit is this
---
"it doesn't matter if there's an exploit because you're not playing the game the way i want you to"

Planning to run another one in October if things pan out well with the tournament (and also with my RL schedule), will put you on the list.
---
Range is everything on a web. The dude basically took an officer mod (which is already super rare) and rolled it into max theoretical range, without even sacrificing the speed reduction.
---
30 people ain't a lot
---
I'll give you 100 robotics
---
What? Are you suggesting all of snuff Titans are injected? Any group that has a large number of Titans has some that have been injected.
---
It probably has the highest range value possible in the game. For example on Rapier or Huginn it would reach almost 100km without overheating. And the speed (slow) modifier is also pretty badass
---
If you put this on a regular fleet huginn you'd have 170km web.
---
Imagine unironically believing that a scenario where all variables are identical except for SP will ever happen.
---
You have completely misunderstood. Bots do not exist only as finished and distributed commercial products. There is no such demand for low quality bots. Bots like that are likely "homebrew" things that the person operating them has made themselves.
---
I think you would be horrified if you looked up just how easy it is to make a homebrew bot with a list of hooks.
---
For what it’s worth... you come off like a fucking champ in those logs. Kudos for dealing with a shitty situation with grace and good spirits.
---
Hey PenifSMASH, Great Roll! :) And thank for sharing this post with the community, it made me crack a smile while I read it on the Southbound A-Train today (or maybe that was the Hazy IPA I had just drank half of :) :) )

Well, it makes sense to me but that's because I've been steeped in it for a few months. I've reread it a couple times and can't quite grok where people are confused. What's throwing you, maybe I can help?
---
How used? Can you elaborate?
---
Hy/Tau love story. With vampires.
---
Not all activities are for everyone. Just because it doesn't mesh with what you find fun that doesn't mean other people with extra isk and time can't find a good time with it.
---
The next time I open a c2, I'll dive in and read up on the sites to see if it will end differently than the c5.
---
Also Canadian, been playing for 12ish years. If you have questions, feel free to ask.
---
Clearly another shit post. 
---
 To correct a few things. 
---
I think the anom timers are global so theyre all the same one when you nerf sanctums they nerfed rallies.
---
Second. Incursions are one of the single largest isk faucets in the game maybe being seconded by null anoms due to the ubiquity of them, everyones doing them not just a few fleets of dedicated players.
---
Third.. If you farm 6/10 your income is virtually unaffected.. Your tick may go down a smigg but with a fully upgraded 0-0 system you end up with 4 rallies then you have to wait like a min or two for them to respawn. I found a nice rythem. If there is another system besides you use that one to now youve got 8..
---
My point is the nerf wasnt that bad. And I personally think they should go farther. Supers make stupid amounts of isk running anoms I would prefer them be allowed in high end deds and have them farm that.
---
The mach got a slot rebalance cuz its one of the ships with the most slots in the game 7lows 6 mids 8highs wtf is that!? Literally like 2-3 slots of the max.. Frankly im surprised it lasted as long as it did.
---
Idk about them nerfing chances.. I think that happened when I was on break last year.. Idk I barely notice it. 
---
The holes aren't gaping yet
---
Why what?
---
I can think of dozens of games with massive time sinks back to EQ days. People did key grinds for final content each expansion that would make time sinks today look like a breeze. 15 hour Fear and Hate raids weekly.
---

---
yea that's why you're here posting about it
---
I wish you screen capped results so I could see it without wasting data on a video.
---
A little from column a and a little from column b. Mostly b though. I haven't injected my main in 3 months. I quit at 40m sp once I was able to participate in things with my peer group. Most of them were sucked out of my miners though, not bought with cash.
---
My wife plexes her two accounts on Delve salvage alone.
---
that is a very big number
---
No. It sounded sarcastic in your head. The title looks normal.
---
Salvaging needs a serious expansion. It plateaus too early. I'm talking tech ii drones, massive wreck harvesting platforms and better loot for skills.
---
I wish you would stop posting but we can't all get what we want

You are missing out on an excellent thread.

Would be helpful if there was some in game loyalty point store list detailing locations for each faction, and if possible a remote list of stuff for sale with costs/trade in items. Not just for FW, even mission stuff would benefit from this (although obviously more of a priority for FW, I'm sure the same code could be implemented for all at the and time). I have an alt that's still in rookie chat and I have lost count of the number of times I've linked websites to newbies who have gotten LP and are clueless as to what they can buy it where.
---
Given the agency overhaul currently in progress, and the mentioning they want to make stuff on agents/FW/faction's more detailed and user friendly as part of this, should definitely be considered if it's not already on the revamp plan.
---
It can be confusing for newbros. In addition to this, while it may not be confusing for older players, it does save them a couple clicks. 
---
Furthermore, while what you said is true, there is no comprehensive list of the Loyalty Point stores in game for Militia members. Mission runners have a slightly easier time since the station they accept their missions from are the same place where they redeem their LP. However for Faction Warfare, you are traveling often, and it can be good to quickly know where your nearest Loyalty Point store is without needing to type in the search bar. 
---
I do hope that the Agency overhaul does alleviate this somewhat. It would be very helpful for newbros.
---
They do turn, and rings too!
---
80... BILLION ISK destroyed?

Getting a lot of requests for this but I would never make people pay for a digital wallpaper, even if that was legal!
---
this is so stupid to see CCP that way... It's not like they try very hard to make eve newbie friendly for years now, trying to make High Sec a place with content for them who grab their hand and show them all aspect of the game (ressource war, fov thing etc) skill injector is part of it, lower abyssal, event etc.. Almost all new content this game had for the last years was made for new player, CCP need that fresh blood
---
Quit bitchin
---
This is why I dont play eve anymore 
---
\#howtore-labelbottingpros
---
Yes isk enters the game, but prices for ships and moda arent really going up
---
I'm not discounting it because its not my play style. Im discounting it because its a bad suggestion. There is a finite amount of dev resources and this is a very bad suggested time use.
---
do it again in a vni, much more fun
---
at first i was like "oh did they disallow abyssal mods in the AT?"

and then i remembered how incompetent CCP is
---
For me my first WH diving was the most fun I ever had in EVE and have lived there for three years now.  
---
Fly an Astero/Strat or any combination.  Easy to get in skill wise and a can bonus that can still fit a probe launcher.
---
Dive in from HS and go a few WH’s deep, as you get more comfortable split up as you are now covering twice the systems, find something and bring the tot her guy to you.  WH mapping software is awesome but don’t wait for it, jump in and make Corp bookmarks to find your way.
---
There is nothing like cloaky ninja super secret stealth mode in EVE.
---
Its a shame resource wars didnt take off. The FOBs could be fun, but unless youre doing them in a blingy rattle theyre a bitch to run and not super entertaining. Though they did seem to inspire the teased player-owned FOB, so that might be good.
---
I'd like to see more newbies forming their own corps rather than going straight into horde/brave/whathaveyou. Small corp fraternity is the best feeling in the game.
---
P.s: want some cereal?
---
Just delete low sec. Problem solved.
---
keep playing whatever way you like. just be consistent on whether you want to fight with wardec mechanics or with pew pew.
---
this is far less of an exploit than [previous loopholes](https://www.eveonline.com/article/pnlesq/war-war-sometimes-changes) -- which also were not declared exploits, just bugs to be fixed -- because it's easily preventable. put structures you want to defend in your own alliance.

I can respect that. I recognize this isn't a  mainstream income path for most players and hadn't considered development resources when thinking about my rig problem. Doesn't mean I don't still want it - just that I can see why it probably won't happen.

Start small as you will lose ships and you will also make far more than you lose.

Train into a battlecruiser of your choice, I used a Harbinger because fuck micromanaging drones with Sleeper agro.

Find C1/2 WH’s in High Sec with a probing ship that is bonused and then come back with your Harbinger to take on the sites.

Fits fine xD
---
Out of curiosity...  what would this even go for? How the hell do you even price it? haha
---
You've got the best of the answers already, but just to add that a frigate should be using small shields, not medium. As a frigate, your best defence is your speed and low sig (rate at which an enemy can 'lock on' to you), meaning the rats are slow to lock you and start shooting, and  they have a higher chance to miss or get glancing (lower damage) hits. Using a medium reduces this benefit, and given your core ehp (effective hit points, as in hull+armour+shield) is not very high, the tiny % increase on this between small and medium is not nearly as good as what you're giving up.
---
As a general rule, frigate/destroyer = small. Only look at medium things if you have spare power to fit and run it, and you really need the small bonus (and can afford the negatives like higher Sig or slower speed or whatever).
---
I sell more officer mods to people who mutate with them than for any other reason. Its nice because usually they buy multiples of my stuff so its usually a fat day for the wallet.
---
Anyone is free to start a newbie focused corp / alliance not affiliated with one of the nullsec groups. The ones my alts have been sent spam invites from so far seem to just want to gather tax.
---
I'm actually surprised a large highsec corp hasn't taken off after the wardec changes. So many people choose to play in highsec already why wouldn't you want to play together?
---
&gt; it would be chaos
---
THAT SOUNDS AWESOME
---
Nah it was saved.
---
NOS Domi nerf or Nano nerf probably.
---
I don't know if you have issues reading, but this is a new bug that your alliance is the firs and hopefully last to use. Do you need me to say that another way or do you understand now?
---
Idk I ask myself every time I log in. FW was always the most fun and most personal. 
---
Which types of T4 filaments are you running? I haven't noticed any decrease in loot recently. 
---
God Damn !!!!!
---
It's comparable to supercarrier ratting. But with a lot less clicking.

Go sell some bought plex, fit a shiny, then link me your dank green kb's OP
---
Selling PLEX for ISK doesn't buy you skill in game.
---
From memory: warp to moon, anchor POS, go cloak somewhere until the anchoring timer finishes, POS snaps to its fixed location in the moon grid, warp to POS, online POS, drop fuel in bay, set a starbase password, go cloak somewhere until onlining timer finishes, watch shield go up, use POS. Then you can anchor some turrets outside of the shield and online those too so it'll have some defense while you're away. Remember to drop ammo in each turret's ammo bay, and use one size larger than the turret. You can anchor a corporate hangar array or personal hangar array so you have a place to drop items, and a ship maintenance array so you can store ships.
---
What's the max range on that with links and a huginn?
---
you can set up that instant gratification in the sandbox.  
---
get on mumble and have all your mates log in at a market hub.

Dark filaments got a lot more popular so high end dark mutaplasmids seem to be worth a lot less. What ones are you running?

Well then.... Let the memes begin

I work 60-90 hours a week. I don't have the time to krab for alts, krab for ships, etc, like I once did. So I use PLEX. Not because I am too bored of PVE, but because I don't have time to grind AND enjoy the game in my playstyle. 
---
The point is that requires isk that isn’t just given to you at a start menu or accrued over matches and shit. You gotta actually set things up to be able to hop into a fitted ship and go. And you gotta have the skills trained.

That’s not instant play

He says while he shuffles people into a corp so they can get 1 leshak kill.
---
Because there's a method in a game full of min maxers that lets them not?
---
Like are we really trying to pretend that 500 million per week is any concern for any null block?  The fucking renter corps could afford that with ease. 
---
If you build it, they will come, and if you let them, they will try.  Thats pretty much the rules of Field of Dreams and EVE.
---
I believe I have detected a misquote. The actual quote is "If you build it, he will come.". [Link to the quote](https://youtu.be/5Ay5GqJwHF8)
---
Imagine how shitty the posting has to be for me to agree with fucking Harvey Skywalker.
---
Clearly that method isn’t working, given the amount of complaining coming out of them. Which is why it’s very odd that they’re not using the really simple solution of declaring war, which as you say, is not exactly a massive burden.
---
fuck you bot its my quote and i'll modify it if i want to.
---
Idk why you're focusing on one screaming infant when theres clearly 2 happily screaming at each other while flinging shit back and forth.
---
They both look like retards, that doesn't mean you need to climb down there with your own pile of shit and start screaming 'ITS CAUSE IT COSTS TOO MUCH'.   Nothing in EVE costs too much anymore, cost as a mitigating factor isn't real and anybody suggesting in anyway that  cost is an inhibiting factor in anything at all is selling you snake oil.
---
There are options to copy your fitting to clipboard after you click the save as... in bottom right. If you copy to clipboard and paste somewhere, people can entering their own fitting tools like EFT/pyfa and better give you advice.
---
I’m not saying it costs too much. I’m saying, what other reason do they have to not just declare war and be done with it? There has to be some kind of reason, otherwise they would have done so ages ago. So, rather than going straight past the point, answer the question of why not just directly declare war.
---
no one talk about it on the goonswarm  The Council of Stellar Management, so therefor no one cares.
---
Is this the nullsec shit post equivalent of people putting their dumb life stories before posting a recipe? But the recipe turns out to be just another whiny shitpost.
---
Well, if I were a guessing man there some mechanical advantage to not declaring.  Gobbins isn't dumb, he is in fact mechanically smart as far as EVE is concerned.  He always has been, he both ran and had hands in designing PL winning AT teams, he's always been good at guessing and understanding the game.
---
If I were to venture a guess (we haven't spoke much since a Vegas 2 years ago other than passing one line jokes) I would assume that there is something that he's getting out of not declaring a war.  I'd have to study the mechanics and whats going on with how it all works (Because ever since the end of the Privateers I've only lived in places where war dec shit doesn't matter) to understand more.
---
Just to tell you though, like it wasn't hard to study this new system and find easy ways to avoid wars or mitigate their impact, we instantly used one to pretty much just avoid wars outright and never looked back at the system.
---
Don't assume cost, its 2019, what your saying might have been valid in like, 2011 in EVE, but not today.
---
Though now that you mention it, it was a serious effort to get Gobbins to gamble in Vegas.....

You cannot surrender as a defender unless the attacker accepts it. Fuck
---
First, welcome to Eve, explore and enjoy!

Second, why does this read like a Google-translated CCP out-sourced marketing questionnaire?

I’m unsure where you keep getting this idea that I’m proposing cost is the reason. The whole premise of this conversation is that it’s impossible that cost is a reason, so therefore it must be something else. At no point did I say ‘well clearly it is because 500m is too much of a price to pay.’ That is a ridiculous assertion, hence my point that it has to be something else.
---
In this scenario, it’s so far not given an advantage, given that they were unable to continue the war, leading in part to the death of the hub after the wardec slipped. So it’s either a truly long term option, or some alternative. Because as of current it’s nothing but negatives.

What's with people in PVP videos putting cap charges in cargo containers?
---
my guess is 50b minimum, if not 100b+
---
Everytime I see a thread about Bengazi I leave an o7 and without fail I get one back within a day.
---
I'm so proud of this community. I hope more attention is given so this situation can never happen again.
---
did you brick the other one?
---
the comment of mine you're responding to originally was to a guy asserting that cost was why they were doing this.
---
Like I could shell out 500m a week forever and not care, and im not that wealthy in EVE comparatively.  
---
I've no actual idea why they're doing it, I'm just 100% sure its got nothing to do with money because literally nobody in null cares about 500m a week (outside provi residents maybe).
---
" I think the anom timers are global so theyre all the same one when you nerf sanctums they nerfed rallies. "
---
I did not know this? is this inclusive of the high sec combat anoms? 
---
Not gonna touch the incursion thing cause I've never gotten involved.
---
" Third.. If you farm 6/10 your income is virtually unaffected.. Your tick may go down a smigg but with a fully upgraded 0-0 system you end up with 4 rallies then you have to wait like a min or two for them to respawn. I found a nice rythem. If there is another system besides you use that one to now youve got 8.. "
---
As I said ticks dropping from 14-16mil to 8-10mil that's a pretty heavy handed nerf. almost 1/3 less escals. I really detest ratting though so could just be me.
---
" My point is the nerf wasnt that bad. And I personally think they should go farther. Supers make stupid amounts of isk running anoms I would prefer them be allowed in high end deds and have them farm that. "
---
I agree with this too an extent. I actually think the money they make is fine if a little on the safe side. But again the tweak should be to the bounties/sites themselves not the respawn rates right and should also be focused on forsaken hubs havens and sanctums?
---
Machs are broken... I love it. CCP have no shame in letting a ship be broken. VNI does battleship levels of dmg. Ferox can out-range anything. And thats why 90% of them feel so unique and fun to fly.
---
Thank you for your comment :)
---
I mean you were warned? Thanks for the comment tho :)
---
im too pu55y to roll it
---
Ill give you 350 robotics
---
Best i can do is 30k isk.
---
Nope I mean an upgraded null systems timers are all the same so the sanctums spawn at the same rate a rally does. I have no evidence to back it up just seems the logical code to use instead of a separate timer for each anom they have to balance individually. And it seems in line with my ratting experience but again no real evidence.
---
I mean does the tick matter when your farming 6s? I honestly take it as a bonus im looking for that dank 1b lewt lol. I personally didnt notice a drop but I took a break around that time. But yes bounties not respawns is probably the way to go aptho the instant respawn we use to have was REAALLY strong.. Like why live in a WH when content is crated for you in nullsec..
---
I honestly think they should forcibly do an ess style system in all null sov and that way reduce the isk flowing. So the "payout" is the same but its in LP probably concord instead of isk. This forces items to be traded for the isk you make not it just POOFing it into the economy which is where the problem lies. We cant take enough out as fast as were making more. So isk is depreciating. Its why the mega rich store there isk in plex.
---
Vni sacrafices a lot to have its dps but I agree it is WAY to high at a theoretical max of like 700 or some obsurd number so I completely agree there. Ferox pays for it in cap use also its literally only good in massive fleets sadly, never seen it used other wise honestly taking away its optimal bonus should fix it. *I think it has optimal bonus?* lol 
---
I still love my mach even after the nerf.. Honestly didnt even notice it till I saw zaqqs polarized mach fit on YT but I haven't been playing as much as I should lol
---
I hope they take a real focus on balance this year they said they are in hailmars QA earlier this year but I hope they put every man they have on it.. Most hulls are usless.. Like who flys gallent baring VNI? Lol a lot of hulls need help atm the meta is soooo small.
---
I have a Freki that would love this. It gets a 30% bonus to Stasis Webifier optimal range as a base stat. 
---
really? thanks man i need em to make more drones!
---
Probably pretty difficult to sell right now considering the largest market for obscenely expensive mods like this would have been the AT. With that gone I'd imagine you're left with people wanting to bling titans and AT ship owners that want them for bragging rights which isn't the largest circle compared to the AT crowd I would think. 
---
That didn't end how I expected.  Congrats.

Hey! you should swing by the dreddit public discord and have a conversation about it with us. Reddit isn't as effective but we have a bunch of dudes who are super active in it. You can get a decent worm fit or a solid assault frig for around 100m . Come say Hi! unironically: dredditisrecruiting.com ( our discord information is there) 
---
Eve has to apply for a banking licence and comply with banking regulations. Not gonna happen.
---
Right because what could the indie game company thats ran a successful game for 2 decades possibly know about long term strategy 
---
Whats your locking range though on that boy?
---
Definitely do this and complete the SoE arc. You'll get a pretty good idea of things to do that suit you.
---
Dear god
---
Do not use Stratios for exploration, high-end exploration ship is Astero OR T2 Exploration frigate, depending on your PvP preferences.

To fly it you need min V, it's a 150% base buff just FYI.

I lost 2 3.5b gila's with 1.5b pods within 24 hours (and back to back at that) due to my own stupidity the other day. (first one was lost due to overconfidence in the new 14 leshak room, the second one was the replacement, where I was so eager to get back out there that I somehow forgot to load drones)
---
Yes, at some time it was almost impossible to buy a tengu or dread char off the bazaar because demand for those was so high.
---
It is just like with the balance issues. Something being overpowered is not as big of a problem if it is scarce. But if you make something overpowered, make it possible for everyone to get the needed skills with money and lower the production price and time it gets out of hand fast.
---
Cargo containers are known as Planck Generators in lore, and they have the property of being larger on the inside than on the outside. You can carry more cap charges if you put them in a container and manage them manually.

Sweet. Will look into that for sure. Worm huh?  That was the first ship we were considering with the Jag next.

With the range this has, you could web someone into warping to you.

Yeah dude we planned to use this bug back in October 28, before the changes, because we knew if dec the war then 6months later we would have a 1 hour window.

Awww he's cute when he's mad, can we keep him
---
out of contex that is something wierd to see in your inbox
---
Maybe a 4/20
---
&gt;Or maybe that's just a guy who plays 24/7, spent all the isk to inject into a day 1 titan alt and buy a titan and doesn't use it for anything but bridging.
---
Yeah that pretty accurately describes alphastarpilot.
---
Been around since 2003, I am/was a 2005 player, and around 2006 there was a TERRIBLE spam problem with bots.  Russian-gold-brides-isk-character-gambling etc etc.   And you'd log in daily to sometimes a few eve mails.   If you spent any time at all in Jita, Amarr or Yulai you'd have dozens of the damn things.
---
Then a friend tells me 'set your accounts to 500,000 isk per eve mail.'  Suddenly it dropped to like 10% and finally 0 eve mails for months.  Of course we told everyone we could get our hands on to put it to 100k each.  The spam got back to control.  Most friends don't care about 100k or whatever (it's like 1 rat?) but bot accounts quickly ran outta isk and became very unprofitable.  Win - win.
---
And this peak waaaaaaaay  back into history brought to you by the (former) Outpost man.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

Was a dope fight. Pretty even sides, lasted quite a long time.

---
My only issue with the worm was drones being prone to damage from the suppressors. We had a lot of success with Hawks and Retributions. 😁
---
Jokes on you I’m a millennial and I’m having a bliss mining in my wormhole with my corpmates.
---
I am still relatively new, I know what a stasis webifier does, but idk what that specific webifier does, why is the new one better ?
---
care to explain ?
---
Most of your players are good people, they don't need bots, scripts or input broadcasting.
---
Wasn't Darwinism, was Snuff. 😜
---
A SoE cap sounds lovely but I think its use would be limited to, idk, WH ratting. Nestors are used there and in highsec as logi only. Personally, in 2 years I've never seen a Nestor doing Explo or PVP. I may try roaming with it tho
---
In Philadelphia it's worth fifty bucks.
---
What an adorable newbie in his titan.
---
Resource wars didn’t take off as the rewards are shite, and are probably my biggest letdown in the game.
---
Well shit, if we are going down that road, if you own sov there should be SOME interaction with empire space.
---
I remember that post and it was more like a fanart than official concept art. From what I know CCP was working on Angel caps but they have never released any models or something.
---
Balanced.
---
They use to much power grid for a rapier 
---
Why is shooting a structure "reinforcing" it? I'm so confused
---
You need 1k powergrid
---
I don't run Gammas, but I do know that filament prices have skyrocketed lately - make sure you're taking account of those, if you buy your filaments. 
---
I have noticed, interestingly, that immediately after a rare drop, the amount of loot I obtain tends to drop significantly. I found a 450m skillbook last night in a T5 - the next few T5s, I noticed that I was only finding the bare minimum of loot (just small amounts of survey databases, and about half the average I usually receive from a site). This has happened to me several times, but it certainly could be a coincidence - it's just something I've noticed a few times.
---
Just because it's a good game and people still hooked up with it does not mean that CCP are some kind of super intelligent rulers
---
Unless someone gave him the isk to inject and buy a titan and he decided to get a bridging ragnarok, instead of the bus that he claims to desperately want and doesn't have the isk for, it's not him.
---
It's 100% a shared account for certain members in Horde/VG and most if not all the major null blocs probably have similar setups too.
---
It is absolutely usable. You sacrifice lows and rigs but it fits. 
---
He rolled an officer web, which is rare and already the best stats on an unrolled web. He rolls the mutaplasmid and get bonus range and stopping power, meaning it’s a maximum bonused web worth tens of billions of isk.
---
The goal is to decloak afk campers before important ops, not whenever you feel like it
---
In order to give defenders adequate time to prepare and respond to an attack, structures in EVE can't be killed in one go. You can't just form a fleet, travel somewhere and kill someone's structure. Instead, you have to attack it multiple times. When you attack it the first time, it goes into a "reinforced mode" for a period of (usually) at least 24 hours before you can attack it again. That's why attacking structures is referred to as "reinforcing" them, or just "reffing" them. The pre-determined time when the structure becomes vulnerable again, or "comes out of reinforce" are usually called "timers".
---
AFAIK before the haven respawn nerf, boson titan with haw guns could get better ticks than a super.
---
Where did i bitch about it?!?
---
That makes sense. I read about the timers, I was just confused as hell because usually reinforcing means good, not bad (like shooting).
---
I hope your handler is well paid. Fuck me.
---
But this  IS good for the game.
---
Then you are still a new player just with an old account nö worries. Makes people think you know what you do. Yeah i mean for faction warfare you need nothing more then a frigate 
---
Sorry, gonna have to outbid ya with 50k isk and some spod 
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/75966642/
---
I'm just gonna leave this here
---
were unspoken &amp; co shooting at goons? if not they should be on the same team 
---
I can't imagine how much of a victim you'd have to be to develop an outlook that makes you keep that many 'friends'
---
I don't think it's a generation thing. Nobody I've ever introduced the game to has persisted. It's the initial learning curve that weeds them out.
---
The last time I checked there was only one for sale for 60B.
---
"Goons and test are not blue."
---
Hilarious. 
---
Lol. Who gives a fuck about afk campers before ops? The goal is to make sure people can't shut down regions by leaving bunch of logged in alts and not even being in front of the computer. A structure with a manually activated module that has half an hour cooldown would be perfect.
---
Sadly, every problem in Eve is solved with extra accounts.
---
Handled that like a pro dude, kudos
---
It was only a Levi, nothing of value was lost. Saying that...what a fucking moron
---
Leave BRAVE.
---
If you are tired of waiting for others to get their stuff set up because they dont have the right doctrine ship ready, or need to refit their shit-fit kiting myrmidon, don´t know what rats you are goin to fight, dont have a ready use ship at hand etc. etc. etc., you have outgrown the newbie playstyle and should look for another corp/alliance. 
---
Thats modeste tbh
---
Probably should have specified T1 frigate vs super haha.
---
I think he didn't mean you, but more the comment from jester, otherwise would not make much sense :D
---
Pro Tip:  It's the defender who sets the vulnerability time and therefore decides on what day of the week the final timer is. So we not only knew in October about these changes, but we could also read your mind on what day you set the vulnerability window. We are pretty amazing right?
---
Hey got this fit 12 months ago still using it. Still works a treat. 
---
Actually, I find people being late/unprepared to be the least time-consuming item on that list. I have a dedicated group of high SP players I fly with in Brave, which helps.
---
I dont see how? I have 8, but am currently running with 4 due to lack of funds ingame/irl.
---
'I'm being primaried' = 'I am the primary target of the enemy fleet' = all enemies are shooting me
---
'reps' = remote repairs from an allied logi ship
---
'It's me' = 'I am an idiot and I am going to die now.'
---
Fights with logi do get chaotic and logi pilots are almost always the most stressed people in the fight because they're all frantically trying to keep up with who's getting hit and keep them alive.
---
Simplification and efficiency. 
---
If roaming, either give people a basic idea of what to bring (nano cruisers 20k optimal) or have a stack of ships ready to hand out. This helps form times and keeps your hauling to a minimum.
---
Cheaper roaming doctrines need less time krabbing to fund. T1 frig fleets can usually be funded purely on loot from stuff you kill.
---
I don't even know what this PIRAT thing is. At least CODE dared to come looking for me in Provi on some vendetta or something. ;P
---
Locked down?
---
It's a system connecting to a HiSec island. That alone might be reason enough to gate camp. There's also a connection to Great Wildlands through it.
---
increase fun/hour rather than isk/hour
---
it was 20-40b before abyssal modifiers came out.  not sure how its changed since.
---
I'd voucher it's within decency norms considering the lack of memes on the subreddit in general.
---
Could they really, though? 
---
How much?
---
Not enough revenue from fw players. They can spend time fixing the mess that is FW but it isnt really worth the time and money investment for them as opposed to making changes to areas like null where a big chunk of the playerbase resides.
---
Thank you penifSMASH, very cool!
---
Well big part of Brave is newbro focused so people shouldn’t really have high expectations, people have to start somewhere right?
---
And as you pointed out, if people do outgrow or want to outgrow the newbies/newbie play style, there’s plenty of “elite” corps out there and again they’ll have to meet certain requirements which could be looked as unpleasant.. 
---
Yes, what i said.
---
I spend the time theorycrafting and making up fits using the Simulation Window.
---
[Turn your downtime up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlbXYrzfxIs)
---
Essentially, you have to play 'lazy'.  Do things to reduce the amount of effort you put in, even if that means relying on others more.
---
Logistics:  This usually just means paying more for convenience.  Buy a ship off contracts (or local market if it is stocked) instead of importing your own.  Pay someone to do shipping for you instead of trying to do it yourself.  Better yet, find a corp or group that has logistics structures in place that do this.  In larger groups this is alliance logistics or whatever.  You usually find in smaller groups that it's a bit more chill, but there will be one or two folks who like being  'enablers' and are always happy to grab you stuff from hisec.  It's okay to rely on them a bit more, just make sure to kick some ISK their way.
---
Travelling:  Don't.  If possible, get a cap.  Put all your shit in said cap and move it to staging.  When staging moves, pack everything into said cap and jump.   
---
 If you have to do multiple trips, you probably have too much stuff.  This can of course be complicated by alliances that have multiple stagings, in which case I would say decide where your primary staging (death clone) is and then have the minimum possible to be viable/useful to your alliance at the other stagings.
---
Krabbing is a little more tough.  Ideally, find a method of making ISK that you either enjoy, or can do while AFK or doing other stuff so it doesn't feel like it comes out of your EvE time.  Pay for your sub with IRL money if you can so you don't feel under pressure to krab up a PLEX each month.  Again, we're trying to play lazy here, so make sure to avail of any SRP or subsidies your alliance has so you can reduce the amount of time you have to spend krabbing, and increase your roaming time.  There's no shame in it, although I guess if you're in a group like Horde that doesn't share that philosophy on SRP you're shit out of luck.  Unfortunately, for most of EvE players krabbing is an unavoidable necessary evil.
---
Waiting: yeah people are dumb.  It sucks.  You can pester them, or just find new people who are maybe (probably not) less dumb.  Not much action that can really be taken here.
---
tl;dr: Find ways to reduce the amount of effort you put in, by relying on others or reducing the complexity of your playstyle.
---
However much s1 ist gonna pay for it. This is a oneoff Item, so anywhere between alottaisk and aholycrabtonofisk
---
Both Moloks and Vanqs r drooling over this
---
also quite possible this is their first titan, regardless of how they made their isk.
---
darwinism probably would have cynoed right into the boson
---
Has been camped by coastal brotherhood or another alliance for a while now. Wondering if they're ever going to let up.
---
so about $1000 for the fit, titan, and character.
---
eh, my titan pilot was 2 yrs training, polished off with injectors.
---
Idiot.
---
&gt; I could train for a year and run in a marathon but why? The event hosts are selling rides on golf carts to the finish line and then selling you a prize at the end.
---
They are proof that people paid for the golf cart.
---
I tried live yesterday to run a Superior sleeper cache with the Nestor. The last room is known to requier massive tank due to the incoming damage. Well the last shockwaves are basicaly wiping anything on field : [https://clips.twitch.tv/AntsyAdventurousSandstormWholeWheat](https://clips.twitch.tv/AntsyAdventurousSandstormWholeWheat)
---
But other than that the Nestor is shit for exploration. Use an Astero or T3C it does the job much better.
---
Because it's not original enough
---
Considering the average EVE player is in their mid 30's with a job/family/partner I'm pretty sure most people would rather biomass and uninstall than have to burn through Imperium space even if it wasn't defended at all. 
---
I offer this exact "training" offer to new bros i findnin lowsec. If you are still interested id be happy to help you out.

Anti cloaky camping threat 200003626#2019 ..
---
Ok, what is the problem then? except need for quite some long time to get this down
---
Because it is needed.
---
More like get a stealth bomber and whore on kills
---
*plays the worlds smallest 2 account violin*
---
And I agree, just expanded on what you said.
---
Laughed out loud
---
im pretty sure rather than a cooldown, a spool up would remove its uses at declocking travellers.
---
one per system, 20minute spool up, can immediatly re use again. uses large amounts of isotopes or fuel blocks to activate?
---
the cloak taking damage is a nice idea. but i think its more to push afk campers away, not kill them outright and destroy a cloak. but it seems the best idea so far.
---
I'm guessing you're not aware that there's already exploration hacking bots.
---
Nice try though.
---
Just show us on this vexor where cloakies touched you
---
Are you mad
---
its a valid ratting fit
---
\&gt;  I make enough ISK a month from industry alone to whelp a super a month 
---
What are you doing in industry that pays so well?
---
You said you enjoyed hunting PH DED runners. 10/10s are still a thing, and people do still use blingy ships to work them. What's stopping you from finding a moderately busy area of null (Provi?) and hunting 10/10 runners there?
---
Alternatively, you could hunt site runners in C5/C6 WHs.
---
Personally, I can't say I enjoy shooting Rorqs, but I do like the idea of hunting folks who are using supers to rat. I've also often been tempted to go after incursion runners -- tend to be blingy ships, poorly fit for solo combat.
---
As someone who had an account since 2006 and spent about 30/40% of that actually playing, and I've got like a 125m SP.
---
Then this injector bullshit comes along and it those years are no longer worth a damn.
---
Cloaky camping doesn't affect anyone, grow a pair.
---
Message me in game for fits and tips. Used to do tons of L4 mission running in Minmatar hulls and rhe Macharial. Would be happy share all my knowledge:) 
---
Gloriam Populum Meum in game name
---
Why it is done then?
---
What you dont like being webbed to a standstill further than only the most specialized ships can shoot?
---
Which travellers are we talking about? I doubt it would matter for people travelling via gates, but if someone's moving blops or caps through my space they shouldn't be getting half an hour safe period. Keep in mind that it's manual module, so first a cloaked person needs to be identified, tackle and probing ships organised etc. Simply pulsing the module won't hurt anyone cause ppl will just recloak 
---
No. It has been said over and over that TEST and Goons are neutral unless fighting against panfam. Just because you're using altcorps doesn't mean that they are not panfam. Be panfam, get blobbed. Simple enough to understand. 
---
&gt;Hawks 
---
what tier ? ive had good success with t3s. 
---
&gt; Cloaky camping doesn't affect anyone with half a brain, grow a pair.
---
fixed it... 
---
I know but  exploration hacking buttons can be easily recognized and have a simple logic of completing them, even if not the most efficient one.
---
non afk cloaky jumps through a gate, he finds a gatecamp. one problem. if he decloks to warp and happily keep moving, they just pulse this decloaking thing and catch him, no re cloaking due to cloak cooldown.
---
this must be avoided
---
I have a few questions about this:
---
1) will someone eat hot wings on stream about this?
---
2) who is eating hot wings on stream about this?
---
3) hot wings: are they gonna get eaten on stream, and by who?
---
4) eating: don't you think hot wings are delicious when on stream?
---
Pls respond.
---
I always look at my profit on a daily run  basis (for example, a day of escalation, a day of abyssal, etc.) and  even if I rarely loot good stuff (mostly databases, condensates in  Exotic), I sometimes come across a high-end loot anomaly. For example, I  had the same profit as you yesterday, arount 20m benefits per run, and  then boom, Medium Disiintegrator specialization and Precursor Destroyer  in one run.  
---
I only run t4 abyssals by the way, not for the profit, but for my mutaplasmids.
---
I don't see a problem with sov owners being able to do it once every half an hour
---
its use it suppose to be to fight afk cloakys or cloakys staying way too long.
---
im not sure why you disagree with me saying people can use it once every 20-30minutes, only it activates and the end of that times cycle. not the beggining.
---
if it activates at the start it becomes a more active deence turret and a way of removing griefing
---
get a friend mate, still good isk split.
---
When we started, we based ourselves on this video with some corpmates [https://youtu.be/6K2GDmJBap8](https://youtu.be/6K2GDmJBap8) (thanks reload), and even if the Pithi A price skyrocketed since then, we still haven't had issues with these.
---
No, not all nullblocs, just poor ones. 
---
Sad thing is the servers will probably shut down before this turns up in a killmail
---
I'd like to be proven wrong, it'd be cool if zkill allowed you to track modules (like I think you can track weapons on CS: GO) but with the owners being anon
---
don't wait , just undock and go
---
what exactly do you do, if its not people not being ready, is it the gathering of ships? sending out pings? what exactly takes so long to get a fleet out?

Because they got ahead of it for once. Supers have started running them because havens haven't spawned in time lol
---
That fucker webs you from another system
---
You won't get a straight answer out of them because they benefit greatly from its 100% safety. So they react violently to anyone suggesting that it be made even only 99% safe.
---
Are you going to finish your sentence?
---
you didn't know very far
---
Get rid of injectors and extractors. 
---
Sell the skill points on the NES store directly.
---
Result is you take back some control of plex price maybe. Right now Injectors are for sale on RMT markets for dirt cheap which is not good.
---
It would be good if you could buy SP and SP reconfiguration from NES store with plex. SP is then tied to the toon/account and cannot be traded with other accounts not tied to the same email account.
---
The end of injectors on black market. Injectors are good but more control is needed.
---
That's just my thoughts on things.
---
This picture could be anything or nothing
---
No efficient way counter it, baiting requires a lot if work and time spent bt many people xompared to just doing nothing, like the cloaky camper which doesn't really require a brain to do what he does.
---
His blops or whatever friends don't have to wait hours, they just form up when needed.
---
To defend against it requires ship with huge EHP like a Super or Rorqual.
---
You're just a butthurt camper that wouldn't like his blatant exploit gamplay nerfed.
---
the reason i disagree is because instead of firing it, quickly removing afk cloaky and going about your own business, the owners of space will have to sit there for half an hour and wait. also like i said, i don't think this should be a tool just against afk cloakys. say you have a gang of cloaky droppers using your space to drop on targets. they only need to move around between two systems every 30 minutes in order to avoid this module, whereas being able to activate it immediately allows you to line up your ducks and tackle them. at the same time, as long as they aren't completely afk waiting for hunters to find targets, they also have a decent chance of warping off and recloaking.
---
Next time, can you keep your shitty ideas to yourself?
---
Your handler is IChooseYou lmao, and you want to take that line hahahaha.
---
&gt; You're just a butthurt camper that wouldn't like his blatant exploit gamplay nerfed.
---
WEWLAD  thats a new one ive not heard before... nice
---
see, cloakys jumping gates, etc etc, it all becomes a defensive turret, 
---
nullsec doesnt need more bloody defence.
---
the role should be to remove cloaky campers only.
---
currently nullsec pussys scared to fight sit docked and cry 23/7
---
with the spoolup it keeps its effect more focused on the AFK dudes only.
---
i love how having to wait 30minutes (by the way im saying it should be 20) your using as a downside xD when right now they have literally no way of dealing with it.
---
if a cloaky isnt afk, he should be able to sit cloaked hunting without issue, it is only AFK cloakys that are the issue
---
Only about 2/3 as effectively as a T3C that's fit for the role. 
---
The dumbest way I lost one of my cerbs was I updated my GPU drivers while running a site. Eve crashed and I logged back in to a burnt out shield booster with 1 more room to go. The inevitability of that one was painful.
---
I also lost one due to the long load times of activating the last gate. Was in warp when the timer ran down and this was a week before the change where that wouldn't happen again but CCP gave me the finger so they can kindly go fuck themselves :/
---
Next time can you not choke on my cock when you try to comment a post .... whoops went to far with that one.
---
then you dont need to jump clone or travel?
---
The point of Covert Op's frigates is that they are niche. Not every ship in EVE needs to do everything, nor should it. 
---
It was obviously sarcastic.
---
Because they're generally not using two to five alts and buying a shit ton of plex. 
---
&gt; Nope I mean an upgraded null systems timers are all the same so the sanctums spawn at the same rate a rally does.  
---
This is not the case, at least it didn't used to be before the latest updates. All anoms were on their own timers. You only need to read the latest notes about these changes to see that Hubs are on a different timer to Sanctums and Havens still.  
---
&gt; Second. Incursions are one of the single largest isk faucets in the game maybe being seconded by null anoms due to the ubiquity of them, everyones doing them not just a few fleets of dedicated players. 
---
This is also not the case, and even if it were it's not relevant. No one is complaining about Incursions. You need to be very organised and have a good group of players to run, and the money is not even as good as super ratting unless  you have a few soak alts. 1 player making 150m ticks, verses a whole fleet making 45m per HQ is not equivalent.   
---
Heaps of incursions in nullsec don't even get run, they just get left or headshot because they're inconvenient. Highsec incursions don't make nearly as much as nullsec, since you can't run them with a fleet of supers. 
---
Why do you hate the astero? 
---
Shouldn't shield regen be more than enough on a shield titan?
---
Who said that ? Astero is dope for Exploration \*dab like a retard\*
---
Oh my
---
&gt;The alliance who drops supers and titans
---
So no different from every other NS alliance? 
---
Yes, hi, hello, I'll take 6.
---
PAANNI?
---
I think anti-cloaky camping should be simpler. Some lore explanation like "cloaked ships still generate heat or engine gases if too long in one place (lets say 2500km range) ", this signature then could be probed down and once analyzed with a new type of scanner (or the ship scanner) module you should be able to see the cloaked vessel. The cloaked vessel could either log off, change system or reboot their cloaking device (put offline and online again)to change it's "cloaking frequency" or something to escape further detection.
---
Tried it with corpmates in blinged retributions, died to boundary a couple times, ragequit. 
---
Only advice would be to go afterburners, not mwds.
---
shitposting war continues
---
Time to raise the roof. I bid 2 veldspar and 55k!
---
Not really a proof, they might have enough isk on the main to cover the injectors for the alt, or simply drain the main for SP manually.
---
I get that it is sensible to assume by default that the injectors were bought straight from selling plex, but there’s so much wiggle room.
---
I’m also curious how far this argument actually goes: am I paying for the golf cart if I can’t sustain my Omega status from within the game and buy subscription for IRL money? I would guess no, but where’s the line?
---
Weird flex but ok.
---
Well a lot of the ratting super/Titans I have seen has a undersized sheild booster. Conserves cap while keeping the sheild levels topped off. The passive Regen is very low on high sheild levels. 
---
I appreciate that you took to time to downvote me with an alt account. 
---
No, hes right
---
    No efficient way counter it, baiting requires a     lot if work and time spent by many people     compared to just doing nothing, like the cloaky     camper which doesn't really require a brain to do     what he does.
---
Ironically this sounds very similar to the classic hunters complaint of trying to find manageable content/escalation.
---
What do you think about restricting FW missions to systems own by the enemy rather than what ever system they are suppose to own ?
---
You reached Warden's voicemail. I am not available a the moment. For whining/complaints about downvotes on reddit please contact your nearest police station. 
---
there are plenty of places in null sec where you can get a fight if you want to. the problem is that people who usually cry about nullsec people being dock don't want to fight. instead of coming to to places where pvp players live, they go to the krab systems or renters, and then complain that krabs don't undock.
---
being able to instantly decloak someone once every half an hour isn't a defensive turret. it's merely leveling the playing field a little bit.
---
use alt for scan and get gud
---
Rythmic noise solo pvp - Approach F1. 
---
But you can totally fit an expanded probe launcher on cov ops frig tho?
---
so now we're just on the other end of the extreme? Nerf cloak and find a solid middle ground.
---
tiny correction to the BR; The Skeleton Crew is on B0T side
---
Yes so do you on other ships (like gnosis) but you will sacrifice basicaly everything from tanking to tackle utilities
---
Is there a significant difference?
---
Actually, we’re not - the reason cloaky camping is so prevalent is because hunting is so difficult. It would drop a lot on its own if increasingly delayed local for falling system sec status was a thing. Would be possible to design a nice trade off between ihub upgrades to increase ratting anomalies or to reduce the delay again, so increasing safety.
---
Well, if we’re talking about cheat codes. Injectors play a bigger role in in-game advance meant than plex does. Sure with plex your wallet gets some padding, but now with injects you can fast forward to the n^th degree 
---
have you ever hunted in null? we are nowhere near the other end of the extreme. null is safer than EVER in the history of EVE.
---
one could argue that you basically have to cloaky-camp to even get kills nowadays...
---
Okay so you do it to allow for more time to be saved, because your shields are kept near 100%. Got it
---
Only if they keep getting dropped.
---
m-maybe!
---
web so good it slowed the fps of the video.
---
yeah, but using cloak camping as a replacement seems like a really bad bandait. This is an issue which should be approached with aligntimes and interceptor speed instead.
---
Fifty bucks? No, no, no. This is a mutated Tobias web. The most dope web in New Eden. Singularly unique, sculptured in design, hand-crafted in New Eden, and water resistant to three atmospheres. Perfect for space ship games with physics closer to underwater submarines than outerspace. This is the web of 2019. Six thousand, nine hundred and fifty five dollars retail!
---
sir please stop posting
---
nope... no idea who you even are or why.
---
Its on life support. The balance might be the worst it has ever been. Your cruiser gang of 3-4 will get capitals dropped on them. People verify your ships and fits on third party sites before they fight. Bots and command broadcasters are rampant. Many areas are almost completely empty. CCPs communication with the community is arguably horrible. They dont seem to give a fuck at this point.
---
Wait, only 16 kilome-

Oh.

---
Honestly, I don't see the problem here.
---
well its not a bandaid. cloaky camping exists for a long time... it just shifted to that since everything else got kinda useless...  especially for stuff like blops..
---
there are so many things that work against you especially as a solo/small-med gang blops that cloaky-camping turned into one of the last methods to reliable catch anything.
---
id be ok with ''nerfing'' cloak if ccp gives us back more targets and not just vni/aligned carriers/rorquals to hunt.
---
if ccp gives us delayed local in order to give hunters a chance to catch targets while having to race against near2 anyways...
---
Good post
---
but it s totally stupid because capital shield booster give so more EHP back.
---
So legalize RMT?  Fuck off with that shit.
---
because fw/lowsec not only for newbies?
---
They also chug capacitor like a hungry elephant. 
---
The wardec thing? I doubt they will ban anyone over it. 
---
I was just saying that i wouldn't recommend using mechanics that are too obviously broken.
---
How is plex a sink? You mean the sell tax or something?
---
problem is it dies in 0.004s. I dont see any use of covops right now. Its shit for exploration and its shit for covops operations (cannot hold tackle long enough).
---
Nah, im sure we will have them in no time! :)
---
Now that I've woken up. I do realize it's actually not. I should've edited my post. But. Gonna leave it up. Regardless
---
I would agree if plex could only be used for game time, but as it is, plex, extractors, and injectors are all tied together, and the "resource" (skillpoints) never runs out.
---
I ran some abyss sites on my own in a retri pretty funny .
---
Sure, but this was never required to enjoy the game or finish the story. But today it's impossible to experience a game's story without grinding the everloving fuck out of it, and this is not ok.
---
That s why you put a capital cap booster too and not a recharger
---
wew lad
---
yeah well, it's an exploration frigate, as the name suggests it's a dedicated exploration ship and for that is pretty good imo: cheap, effective, fast and highest probe and virus stuff strenght in the game. it's not really designed for combat, but you can fit for it, albeit to a certain extent. if you want a tackle frig you should just get a ceptor, if you want an exploration ship that can hold its own in combat grab an astero. if you want a jack of all trades ship able to do all the above effectively, you pay a premium price and get a t3c. what you're asking for is a t3 frigate, and that unfortunately doesn't exist yet.
---
He's Titan ratting. 
---
One he's lazy
---
Two he's lazy
---
And he sits on his ass a long time form boson to boson. Plenty of time for the recharger to do it's trick. 
---
And three he's lazy
---
np (no problem) :)
---
And 4 he has lost his titan.
---
And 5 that prolly not gonna stop him. 
---
But the name says "covert ops frigate" and it is not design to fill this roll
---
I tried the same on the test server.
---
What kills you aren't the npcs (granted they are still very dangerous) but the time limit.
---
In every unsuccessful run on the test server, i died because i wasn't fast enough. 
---
I am not my computer right now but i am pretty sure that covert ops frigates have bonus for probe launcer cpu requirements.
---
Because systems that end up being asset safety locations are a gold mine for easy ISK making.
---
I had stuff in Faspera which I got out easily with no loss but so many people were stupid and lost their stuff.
---
You are just unlucky or prices are dropping.
---
If I had a penny for every bad rng thread..
---
Forget months, literally years.

---
Which ragnarok toon is this?
---
Thank Bob they got rid of that god awful event. Kept interrupting perfectly good mining streams
---
I’m averaging 200-250 mill an hour profit from t4 gammas 
---
Must be shit luck. 
---
I can do about 4 sites an hour in a gila. 
---
I felt the same as you and paid real money for the first couple of years. Then CCP did something stupid, and I refuse to give them any more cash. So now I'm coasting on that previous investment to some degree, and plexing instead.
---
Right, thats fine and is as workaround solution, but it doesn't rectify the underlying problem of the mechanic still being faulty and not working as it should where war assist is concerned.
---
Awesome, that's good to hear. Thank you.
---
Oh how contemporary of you, referring to a fight that occurred two nights ago, well done.
---
Setting that aside, most conventional bomb runs will get around this quite easily (putting a perch more than 200 away is not difficult and is often necessary anyway so you can warp to target on probe cycle).
---
It will also not inhibit the common stuka/goku bomber convention that is popular nowadays, since those doctrines don't cloak.
---
What it will do is add an element of danger to people who linger cloaked on grid long term; e.g. trying to move around to provide a warpin, etc.
---
It will also add a dimension of counterplay to probed down blops ships, since they will need to act more rapidly to reposition for a cloak after covert bridging their dudes out.
---
Considering most people are pushing for system wide effect, 200km radius isn't even effecting your whole grid.
---
So yes, it's modest.
---
I wager he would have lost the titam regardless of his fit...
---
We aren't shooting at the Imperium.
---
CCP doesn't care about that far in the future.  The last couple years were designed to be attractive for a buyout, and we're currently on the "inflate numbers to get the other half of said buyout" phase.
---
EVE has survived this long in despite of CCP (and any real competition, that's the main one), not because of them
---
Considering they're a temp ban-able offence per the subreddit's rules, I'd expect very few to be permitted on, generally adjusted on the subjective quality.
---
I am farming T3 Darks in 2 Hawks, Light Missile fit. Missiles dont get effected by the Dark sites so you're gucci. Just dont get his by the drone cruisers.
---
It's kinda sad how many people told them repeatedly exactly what was wrong with them before they even came out, and CCP chugged along in their little magic bubble and released them as-is anyway, and still can't figure out why nobody does them.
---
Good guys win again
---
What do you have 4-8 accounts for? 
---
If those are mostly afk vni, cut those. 
---
Assuming they bring 60 mil/h, you have to run them for 20h to make 1.2b. what are 500 Plex now? Sry I'm not in the loop since I never work with Plex. 
---
So let's assume 30h of krabbing to just break even. That's almost a workweek for most people you have to sit at your PC. Just to break even. If you have a full-time job, it's not worth it. Even when subbing them with real money you have to account for Plex prices. 
---
Except you can run eve at your workplace. 
---
2 subbed toons should be enough for almost everything. It's 30 bucks a month, less if you buy playtime in bulk. 
---
&gt;A 5 min delay could fix it somewhat. You could change cap damage as much as you want, but it wont matter as they just switch to blops if caps become ineffective. 
---
I agree with you that small delay might work. But not 5 minutes. And blobs are not a problem. They are easy to fight against. 
---
That is rich, coming from a guy who only has walnuts in his brain.
---
Well, maybe a better idea is to make it less so, maybe make it difficult, variable, maybe only doable in bursts, but give appropriate rewards for the time invested.  
---
A small number of "Burner" style bosses in ratting anoms instead of endless waves of same-same rats. Put valuable loot on them that you need to carry home and then sell but which makes the time spent worth it.  
---
Side benefit: players learn to fight/play better.
---
Downtime (as you put it) is an integral part of Eve Online and makes the fun parts, when you get them, more fulfilling. Organization and time management are skills, the better you (and your friends) get at them, the less downtime (as you put it) you'll have
---
Accept it as part of the game, and stay away from people who look like they have shit organization, and you'll be okay
---
Well yes but actually no
---
Personally, if I wanted a game where I can just kill stuff all day I'd just go play LOL or CSGO
---
3x cheap fit Hawks can do T4 darks
---
&gt; With vampires.
---
do they sparkle? 
---
Hit me with a fit?
---
I can personally vouch that bluemelon and casper used them. In pvp. As bait.
---
thx
---
&gt;I do not have any concerns at present.
---
Really there are 3 scenarios: 
---
1. CCP sells this ( that's a big issue ) 
---
2. CCP gives this away ( That's a bigger issue because honestly dumping more free SP into the game is only encouraging more people to multi-box 80 accounts and farm sp to pay for them ). 
---
3. CCP is preparing for when the servers catch fire meaning the known it's likely to happen in the future. 
---
Neither of those would lead me to go well I don't have any concerns.
---
It must be long enough for people to have a realistic chance to shoot the cyno ship. The goal should be to cut back on instant travel.
---
You cant fight most blops.
---
Hello so confused, I am Warden\_of\_Venal, pleased to meet you
---
From economic theory the solution to your problem is specialisation. Not 100% sure if this is the best bit from this book, especially since ideas build in the book, but I think if you really want to understand your question the answer might be [here](https://mises.org/library/man-economy-and-state-power-and-market/html/p/945).
---
Basically, in a big organisation or a big economy you want to specialise to doing one thing really well. Now, that's only if you want to make as much money as possible, not necessarily the most fun. However, it's the same reason people have professions and everyone isn't just randomly jumping between different kinds of professions.

Seeing that this post of yours is now at -5, he must have a lot of alt accounts.

Maybe because they didn't cheap out on wardecs... Keep your shit in alliance and just dec. Until them there isn't much you can say.
---
The officer webs have battleship levels of PG as additional fitting costs, so... no beuno (unless an abyssal roll makes it magically disappear)

I was absolutely convinced you were going to brick this thing.

In terms of raw SP, yes, in terms of knowledge and friendships gained, not even close.

Stopped playing because of them
---
if you can't afford to buy it twice then you can't afford it
---
in theory eve is pay to win. you can outbling everyone and through that, you can win a lot more. but there are three reasons why it's not a problem:
---
once you are dead, just once, your investment is spent. therefore, you pay to win factor is not permanent, and does not force a non-payer to spend $
---
you can only get ingame isk by selling to another player. people not spending $ indirectly always profit from you, spending $
---
there is nothing you can buy for $ that you cannot buy for isk. (sometimes indirectly, via plex, which is possible, thanks to the first guy, selling plex ingame)
---
This as a base.  Add bling/implants/drugs to improve performance/safety, but these cost like 60m each.  Basically speed + range tank everything, only thing that can ruin your day is webbing/scramming  Damaviks so kill them first.  Neuts next, but you can kite them generally.  Tank can get hairy on a bad spawn with a lot of said Damaviks, but otherwise its pretty easy.

You mean Sirens?
---
Try fighting back in game instead of on Reddit
---
Holy shit. That's mental.
---
A web (stasis webifier) is a module that slows down the ship it is activated on.  Ii this case over 64%.
---
Sirens are not drones. 
---
Just to add that C5s can also use 2 nestors or 1-2 dreads (one works fine but I think its slower than 2 snakes or maybe about the same speed)
---
C6 is usually 2 dreads but I believe it can be done with 3 nestors

Wow. A whole retribution got killed.

This video really showcases how stunning the visuals in this game are. Great work.

When winning with 129 people against 43 makes you so desperately smug you have to post a reddit post about it.

well my first astrahus i moved in bpc pack then mined ore in wh reprocessed and built it from scratch. that was my  first  structure ever i manufactured. was  very curious what to do,friend gave me instructions how to anchor it properly and secure it [rolling holes untill  it completes anchoring and repair timer] we did  built our citadels  at same time and anchoring aswell. it was nice lesson. 
---
only problem is with dumb people that carry  citadels in t1 industrials. they can but should never do it..simply never. if really need then  dst/orca best to move astrahus.  shit hit fan if its c1 hole then impel.  i sdont use blockade runners because they gdie too often,gankers hunt them even if they carry notthing

They're spy ships. And they spy on people very well. They aren't supposed to be combatants.

Well if he is afk he’s not a threat , if he isn’t bait him ... if u aren’t able to bait him , go back to highsec
---
Says who? 
---
"unfuck your fucking overview!"? :D
---
This is a pretty bad post. Just because /you/ don't see the use case of the ship doesn't mean it is bad and needs a rework. I've lost hundreds of cov ops over the years because of how I use them (scanning for fleets and a personal +1 scout) 
---
You said that the astero is better but I disagree, with Covert Ops 5 you have better scan strength not to mention the cheaper cost or the ability to fit covert cynos.
---
Scanning T3s also are pretty terrible since the re-balance and are only something I use if I use a virtue clone. 
---
As a heads up, a pos is not an ideal option unless you are planning to only be there for a short period of time. Citadels are cheaper in fuel cost, easier to run and also POS are being removed from the game soooo your home will become obsolete.
---
Just some suggestions, there are lots of chill null groups like Brave Newbies and Pandemic Horde. For wormholes you can check out WiNGSPAN if your goal is to hunt and not live in wormholes. Otherwise EvE University offers a lot of options for wormhole and nullsec living
---
Most of the time the set up is the fun part.
---
And yeah, the 20 minute ticks is how it works
---
Ccp when they fix this next week
---
Did you roll the second one or did you call it quits after the first?
---
Do I have a fucking video camera in his house to know when he's afk and when not?
---
And baiting requires a whole fleet to waste hours until he decides to make an action.
---
Having points/scrams as drones instead of as modules is probably pretty good design. It would let combat ships break tackle without having to win a fight. Battleships wanting to escape would need to choose whether to send drones after other drones or to just try to kill the ship pointing them. There'd be way more counterplay than trying to neut a scram off (and it would be easier to see, besides). And it makes a whole bunch more sense to send a bunch of drones to interfere with a ships ability to go to warp than it hit it with the no-warp beam at a distance.
---
Of course, having to lock up multiple flights of drones every combat could be miserable, but nothing's perfect.
---
I can trade you a dozen velators. 
---
There is no enchanting for capital scrams and points - why?  Why i cannot trash those officer level scrams.....
---
Depends.
---
Does fire sparkle?

---
Nope, nothing there
---
There is a difference between Capitals (Fighters) and Subcapitals (Drones). For some strange reason only 1 Ship and its "drones" break this scheme. 
---
\^\^This. Join SC for the explo stuff, but you'll need an alt for the pewpewpew. 
---
Good, you have let the past die and are now ready for the future. 
---
Thanks for sharing what you're dreaming about, I guess?
---
True but a POS can be set up for automatic defense. I don't think that's possible with a citadel.
---
i remember this system. crossed it once  in my ares. i escaped  with no damage
---
I mean it can, but it’s awful. POS auto defense don’t always focus a target and they regularly swap...realistically you need someone manning it just like a citadel.
---
this ship could potentially bring  gameplay on higher level
---
bring  ixion to gameplay and swordspine and fury too. 
---
then  make hellhounds as loot from drone ded sites
---
did u know there was ever exsisting pos logistic structures? yes they did  implement into game  "structure repair array" or something. they never were seeded.  there was even pos cloak module too
---
the fuck is that sentence even supposed to mean lmfao
---
How ?
---
All covert ops frigs are dps bonused towards their racial weapons which is a bit pointless in my opinion, who fits dps on a cheetah? How about changing the racial bonus to something useful (like scan time)
---
WAIT!!!! He didn’t win a fucking Oscar?!?!?!?!?!!!!
---
so do you run 24/7 and find 2 officers per year? or is there an other way of getting them I am unaware of.
---
I've not bee. On eve in a while. What is this witchcraft?
---
Thank you ! This 
---
Could be interesting to have an intermediary class bridging from battleship size to capital ship size. KInd of like destroyers for frigate &lt;&gt; cruiser, or battlecruisers for cruiser &lt;&gt; battleships.
---
It sounds like it would have fantastical PVE usage though, and would quickly become the new go-to thing for botters.
---
and they look like potatoes too. 
---
Pointing drones and fighters are both retarded.
---
if only there was a way to know when a certain player is active :thinking:
---
I did that double take too haha!
---
Yeah... quit while your ahead on this one I think, DAMN nice roll!
---
Alpha injectors are just paying for omega training piecemeal. You still gain 1 days worth of sp each day, but its just applied in the form of an injector.
---
Hypotheses on how this happened:  
---
1. Fleet member had to go, told his friends to pop him to save having to burn home later. "Ok dude see you later haha +1 killmark, etc etc."
---
2. Fleet member calls out FC "Hey FC, you're an asshole." FC: "Oh no you di'n't" \*broadcast guy as target\* "haha jokes on you op success boy wolololol"
---
3. Guy was the FC. "Hey guys sorry we haven't gotten any kills. Lets head home" "Oh don't worry FC, we gon get ours" \*ship alarms blaring\* "Haha gottem" "Oh you mad lads lol"
---
4. "Hey you know what we should do? We should get some salt factory to post about us on Reddit thinking he's calling us out but is actually just proving he's a brainlet." "Oh that sounds like a great plan to spend this Thursday afternoon, how do we do it?" "Okay bear with me on this, but we should..." 5 minutes later: \*killmail\*
---
Any 60% web rolled to max speed decrease bonus is also hilarious on a serp ship. Almost 97% speed decrease from one web
---
That just makes it super obvious what you're doing since you pop up on d-scan every time you take a wormhole. It's easier to just have some covert tackle sitting in the site with them, and/or warp a hyperspatial sabre into them. I just assume ratters will warp off if they see *anything* on d-scan, including core probes or frigate scanners 
---
He said that he sells them, not that he necessarily farms them. He could be a broker for them.
---
Yeah, this is indeed true. Because of this, I am more cautious when I see a new char in a faction BS(or anything juicy) roaming around.... but lets face it... your still gonna try to tackle it regardless haha
---
Bombers Bar I think? 🤔 
---
The Stratios is by far the greatest illusionist after Copperfield.
---
It managed to fool an entire gaming community into thinking it's a good ship
---
no siege mod no  triage. it woul be slow as carrier so easier to tackle. botting?? not sure about this,who would rat with ship that cannot be insured
---
Yeah there's also a guy who makes a bunch of T1 Rigs and sells them cheap in Odebeinn.
---
Thats a good point. For a single player just buying/making an alt, its not much of a difference. For a farming operation or larger scale op, it does change things.
---
beautiful cinematography
---
capital scan rigs would be useful. right now there is no ship that can benefit from capital scan rigs.  with max  implants and skills with rss probes and sisters scanner and t2 upgrade rangefinder you cann only squeeze around 130 in scan strenght while same  config for  t2 covops  gives like 208 scan strenght.  even praxis  can reach around 190 scan strenght with said configuration
---
At this point id be thrilled if someone from CCP would just recognize the existance of FW. 
---
You can use it for exploration. The Nestor is interesting because its the only battleship that can enter C1 holes, so you could use it to run all kinds of low-tier sites. But it will draw attention to it which is usually not what you want while exploring. On the other hand you can use the fact that most people vastly underestimate the Nestor to your advantage and get some good fights. Its hella versatile, the second fastest BS in the game, tanky af, but has fairly low DPS.

---
If that's how you think it works, I don't think you understand the game.
---
Never before has the phase 'you wouldn't understand' been more relevant. 
---
Because nullsec keeps players, faction warfare does not. As a guess--and seriously, this is just a guess. 
---
\*fake edit\*
---
In other words, perhaps nullsec gets much more attention because CCP has access to data on player retention and revenue generation, and has decided that nullsec keeps more customers who pay more money than things like faction warfare; however, this is pure conjecture based on nothing. 
---
Can't sell prints legally (not even signed prints as its still breech of copyright laws regarding Eve online IP), but every one is free to make their own prints of any artwork I've ever made
---
I also don't believe in watermarking the work I've done, I'm much happier knowing that people are enjoying artwork of mine than trying to squeeze money for a print (though signed limited edition prints I see as great things to give away or sell for charities!)
---
Good that titans have some usability. 
---
No
---
i guess not, i've never felt so victimized by a space guild lol
---
Dont understand the pb here. It s just standard game nechanic in HS. If horde wants to fight each  timer without thinking of these mechanic, they need just to put the market citadel in horde. Or put a big army / mass alpha in the alliance of these market.
---
Nothing hard.
---
The overhauled war decs, so such a structure makes perfect sense. If CCP has hard data that shows that cloaky campers legitimately leads to people logging off, then canceling their subscriptions--which sounds crazy to me as someone living in Delve--then it makes sense to balance cloaky camping. 
---
My guess is that any such balancing won't be too bad. It will probably be either a module that prevents all cloaking in a system at the expense of some other essential ihub; or, one that needs to be activated and pulses the system to deactivate cloaks. 
---
If it is the later, it will really only heavily impact afk cloakers, as a piloted cloaked ship will probably just be able to immediately re-cloak itself. 
---
as much as i'd love to have a new drone carrier like those of old.  it would be a problem due to afk ratting.
---
What's that ugly new pirate line of ships? They get web bonuses and scram bonuses iirc
---
I want this today, CCP, today!
---
So with an 8-8-8 layout you won't need NSAs to be competitive, you'll get minimal shield tanked Sebo fits with  max cruise missiles + drone damage amps. Think of it like a rattlesnake on steriods.
---
I think you need to revisit your understanding of what botters do. In a nutshell botter ship selection is based on how easily they can maximizing their ratting income, and automate the getting safe process by warping off grid if anything threatening enters local.
---
With no NSA requirement this is a perfect botting vessel that will deal probably excellent DPS (based on the slot layout, I would say 1,000 - 1,500 dps quite easily without considering further bonuses like SOCT ships are full of.
---
Insurance is the very last thing a botter thinks of; in fact most botters tend to use supercarriers when they can, which you will agree have a very poor insurance payout ratio.
---
Like I said, it's an interesting idea, but it will definitely be abused.
---
A-T all stars and Carl. Watch out for that boundry Carl! 
---
No its not
---
No but imagine higsec without local ... no way knowing that in the system you are jumping in there is 50 talos fleet waiting for you JF full of faction fortizars. 
---
Horde can just put the citadel in horde. Oh wait, it s probably too difficult.
---
I just came everywhere
---
imagine guardian vexor fitted with 10 of these
---
Just full drone-nav derp frigs and nanocruisers will reeeeee harder than about carriers. 
---
Heavy damage taken (worse than a Komodo), cracks forming, FRT disbanding soon, more news at 11.
---
Yeah we really need something between caps and subcaps, im really waiting for it
---
Dronebay of that size would mean 5 ice harvesting drones. No way that will be exploited to hell and back right?
---
i thought Bong supposed to bring gameplay "higher"
---
Just use an Astero until you can fly Cov Ops ships. Then keep flying the Astero until you lose it. Then fly Cov Ops ships because they're dirt cheap.  
---
As far as combat goes I just fit my explo ships with warp core stabs and if something shows up on grid I just warp off and cloak.  
---
Sometimes you're still doomed to die though, dicktors are a thing.
---
no the SOCT capital ship will be an ambulance carrier that collects the wounded from ship wrecks and perhaps corpses that could be still brought back to life

Why should I want to use a capital for exploration? Do you know u shouldn't stay in your home system while exploring? U should warp from sys to sys to check for sigs.. Hf doing this with a capital..

What would you use said scanning capital for that can't be done by an astero? 
---
He's probably right.  I mean why would you rat if you can afford to drop a couple of grand on injecting a Titan?
---
For example, I don't rat (hardly ever).  If I need a few bill quick I give CCP some of my real-life money.
---
Lol no
---
Yeah you're wrong but it's okay. 
---
CCP lost their ass on FW. Dust 514 was a bust, which imo was an investment into FW. 
---
Most of the activities you mentioned are all part of "playing Eve". Eve is a very slow game and its totally normal to spend hours doing slow thinks, like preparing your ships for the next roam etc.
---
One way to mitigate those low intensity activities is to delegate them. e.g. ask your alliance logistics guy to get ships for you etc.
---
Also, good preparations is a crucial part of being successful in Eve. FC spend many hours parsing intel and planing an Op before it starts. Many people are developing new and better fits for their ships.
---
Honestly, if you don't have the patience for the slower stretches of Eve. Maybe this is not the right game for you?
---
I don't think I've ever been victimised by a space guild at all.
---
link your lossmail
---
what time this month are you all out at fantasy flight? how will i know who you all are if i show up?
---
I suppose the largest, most loyal and most engaged group of players (= paying customers) is Null Sec. So naturally CCP will prioritize their game experience over smaller and less loyal groups like FW.
---
You can also see this is true by looking on the makeup of the CSM in the last years. Just count the number of Null Sec representatives vs. the rest.

Here’s the best guide to the Nestor out there:

Yea but realistically most ships that dont die instantly can kill fighters and support wings are limited to 3. A light drone sized scram would be a pita.

Just undock.

I'm not a huge fan of afk gameplay. That includes both camping and PVE like mining and VNI ratting.

What is the significance of the heat status (not module heat damage) meters for low/med/high slots surrounding the capacitor? I'm curious to know what happens when one of those meters reaches 100%.

---
What did you do to please the loot fairy? I need to do this as well.

He means tackled BY an Aeon
---
You can read about it in the Residual Heat section on UniWiki's Overheating 101 page [here](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Overheating_101).  Basically, those meters go up the longer your heated modules are running, and the higher the meters are the more likely your modules will take heat damage.
---
Well, actually we are waiting for the response fleet so that we can have a fight against something that shoots back at us. But nowadays, a typical response fleet in a NS blob consists of 3243842384 titans/supers/faxes, do i have to explain why 3 cruisers are running away from those drops?

---
Killing a VNI/rattlesnake is boring as fuck btw, but it's the only way to make coward spodbrains undock and fight. (Although they usually leave their friends to die :/ strange concept from my point of view since we pretty much do the opposite: wait for idiots to tackle our farmers so that we can get a fight).
---
Eve is a logistics game.  PVP is just a by product.  
---
Doesn't scram though
---
Ok, so I haven't played eve in a long time.  I have never seen these things that roll the stats on mods before.  It looks like they function like Vaal orbs from PoE in a since that they have a chance to brick your item or make it better.  When did they add these things to the game?
---
assuming you extract those accounts, going omega with a VNI alt is like 300M per month.  Or about an afternoon's worth of AFK ratting (which cause AFK can be done while you are playing on a main).  And then you have an Omega toon to light cynos, PI, indy, etc. the rest of the time.  
---
youll find all things that fit a covert cloak have reduced tank, reduced dps, reduced fitting, reduced everything.
---
its known as balance. to 'improve' covert ops frigates you could simply remove the drone bays and gun turret slots completly to stop people seeing them as combat ships. they are not, they are scouts. scouts only. :)

What is the best ship for ramming?
---
No.

Yes but let's be honest, asking for small but easy fixes that could happen is better then asking for more complexes changes. Things like suspect timers for non FW on plexes gate and fuel consummation for non militia in the system should be easier to implement than a complete mission overall.

Ratting character killed 4 days after being created and injecting into a Titan, killed by Snuffed Out no less.  I see nothing wrong with this.

See!! They're even in the eve subreddit!! :P
---
I can yield the anoms argument bit will not yield the incursions. Yes anom ratting may be the largest bounties in the game but incursions is a very very close second.. 
---
Have you done them? Yes soak alts help but they are infinitely farmable test alone made trillions off the last one in our space.. Noone persues them because they tend not to spawn under umbrellas. We farmed ours for almost a week before we killed it. Me alone making a solid few billion. With two toons.. No soaks. So yes a single super can make a bit more solo but compared to 45m ticks in like 10-20 mins. And how safe incursions are.. Honestly they shouldnt even spawn anywhere but high imho because they make THAT much isk. Im actually curious if incursions are lumped into bounties in the MER will check next time. Cuz they should be theyre not a bounty by standard rules 
---
Yes I can argue it takes more for incursions but if isk devauling and how much of it comes into the game is the discussion you CANNOT leave out incursions.

"All ships except Capital ships can enter the site."

The only thing I would add here is that if you’re doing your own logistics take like 5 extra minutes to think ahead. There’s a lot of times I’ve had to make an extra trip because o forgot 1 specific mod or to restock a certain ammo type that I definitely had room for on my previous trip. 
---
An hour prep for a week or two of PvP isn’t bad, an hour per roam on the other hand...
---
We'd see a lot more smart bomb usage.
---
&gt; Because systems that end up being asset safety locations 
---
You are correct here but the rest is unrelated.  
---
Frulegur is the low-sec chokepoint through which the high-sec island must flow, sure, but the primary reason that is so heavily camped now vs 2 years ago is that Odebeinn and Konora are both null-sec asset safety locations.  Many, many people try to retrieve their stuff unsafely, without scouts, or try to bring home their newly released asset safety'd freighter to high-sec.  Given that it's already worth it to camp the system due to the heavy increase of asset safety traffic, the individuals who camp the system also generated bait contracts that require freighters to complete, and unsuspecting pilots who do see a high-sec start and high-sec end point on a contract but fail to notice the low-sec system through which it must travel also end up as sheep for the cosmic slaughter.
---
All of this requires travel through Frulegur, much of it is high value or freighters, and many of the people doing it are dumb null-sec "carebears" without a game knowledge safety-net to prevent piss poor decision making.

@ what

I mean, he could have just bought a titan character in the old days.
---
Stupid idea
---
It would mess with quite a lot of things. Having a single point/scram on each ship means the tackling ship has to at least enter the danger zone of the target ship to hold tackle. These drones would have to have some kind of highly restricted range to be balanced. They would also have to be very high bandwidth otherwise you'd have fleets or wings of ships throwing swarms of tackle drones at targets. You would also have to rebalance quite a few hulls, as you suddenly have a free midslot and additional CPU available. Interceptors would need a complete redesign, Arazu and Proteus bonuses would need to be reworked, etc. etc etc.

Bubbles are easy enough to counter with positioning, but point drones would peel enough off that every time an enemy FC tries to run away he'd be sacrificing at least a couple of ships that were DronePointed.  
---
It would force them to commit to more fights more often, and play it all the way through for better or for worse.

Yes because black ops and command dessies are the main victims of supercarriers.

(Most regular ships wont have MJDs either because of mid slot constraints)

I'm sorry but I would like to exclude myself from the responsibility of what ever this is.
---
Here's how:
---
\-Buy plex (with RL money), sell for isk. Never krab again.
---
\-Join a corp with highly active FCs and motivated scouts who know how to do drops/kill krabbers. Krab hunting is one of the faster content generators (Although admittedly things can go wrong)
---
\-You can start roaming FW space, which is still pretty good fun per hour 
---
\-I hear Abyssal PVP is pretty fun but I haven't tried it yet, and also instanced PVP is kind of not "real" EVE
---
\-There are several doctrines (nano dessies, instawarp+nullified ceptors) that are extremely effective at roaming hostile nullsec space. These are fast ships that are difficult to catch and kill that, with enough numbers, can kill almost anything. You'll be in and out of hostile space very quickly. Instawarp+nullified ceptors are actually some of the most fun you can have roaming.
---
What if Scrams/Disruptors were limited to Frigates and Drones?  Maybe limit the Warp Disruption drones to a Heavy or Sentry Drone weight class too.  
---
Crusier v Cruiser would require drones for tackle, but it would free up a midslot for activities, and force a real choice between DPS and Scramble drones.  
---
Fleet engagements would be very different as well.  Bubbles are easy enough to counter with positioning, but point drones would peel enough off that every time an enemy FC tries to run away he'd be sacrificing at least a couple of ships that were DronePointed.
---
It would force FC's to commit to fights more often, and play it all the way through for better or for worse.
---
I'd keep them on Frigates because that's what gives newbros value on Day 1.  Nothing beats being given a classic newbro rifter with a scrambler and telling them to go point the enemy or die trying. 
---
Hm. I mean you can't prevent attackers using alt corps and such, but does that make you require to use out of alliance holding corps yourself?

I'm perfectly honest, i don't have much to do with wardecs and I'm not too deep into it from reading some patch notes a couple weeks back.

I suspect there was a mass exodus of people who cared and tried to post semi-constructively during CCP's year long span of nothing interesting. They got fed up and left. Now we are left with all the troll/meme posters and newbro posts with the occassional goodpost once every couple weeks.
---
Hopefully this new patch will start breathing some life back into the sub and game. Granted it wont fix everything, but its a start. If CCP is serious about fixing their technical debt and doing more balance this year, then we could see more players logging in to actually fight.

You can't shut down regions with logged in alts while being afk... problem solved.

It's never the afk characters that are the problem, it's what's behind it. You're just scared because someone is able to invade your 'safe space'. If you have a standing fleet, you can punish them for coming to you.

There is actually a _lot_ of traditional logistics in eve, but then you also have logistics ships that have nothing to do with the logistics that occurrs in eve.

I'm actually got my brothers to start playing eve with me and we rolled up some new alpha characters and we're trying to see how far we can go running abyssal sites. So far we've just done T1 darks in breachers, but we're going to switch to kestrels because of the range bonus, and then maybe garmurs. I think T3 should probably be doaable ish with three highskilled alpha and good ships. But we have yet to see. I also keep pushing for RR cruors in electrical sites, but I'm a bit worried about getting alpha'd by drifter BS wrecking shots. Anyway, it's good fun to see how far we can go.

Why would it be Caldari either. Gallente ships are the ones that get scram/point bonuses.

Beyond bad decisions or greedy decisions ccp made there is lot of room for balance pass that scramble the meta. I think between the need to sell injectors and the will to keep game alive they started working on this recently. If you look at other games out there constant reworks and changes are frequent. In eve some glaring flaws are left unanswered for years of not decades.

There is an application called maintenance tool but it just gives me an error message when i try to run it so.

my poor 800mm autocannons t2 on machariel become useless.why train them when u can buy  faction ones and do same. 
---
i wont switch to faction guns never. im fan of tech2 gunnery.
---
that's because people are retarded. A single Caldari Navy Light Missile Launcher sets you back 40M ISK; a single T2 Rapid Missile Launcher sets you back 1M ISK. You wanna spend 39M more per launcher to fire T2 light missiles, you go right ahead but for most people faction ammo + Meta4 modules are perfectly fine.
---
IMO it will actually be a choice now:
---
Until now T2 guns were the Nobrainer pick, especially on weapons with really strong t1 ammo, like Lasers. Now with this change people can decide to lose a bit of damage for better fitting but still benefit of t2 ammo choices. 
---
T2 guns wont become useless. As the faction guns wont get the bonus to the Specialization skill of the t2 ammo so they will do less dog than the t2 gun with the same ammo.  
---
uh a lot ya fucking retard

There were a number of posts regarding a sustained pattern of &lt;5-minute response time from anchor to wardec which Horde maintained 23/7 for months
---
It was further confirmed that they would respond in this manner to citadels anchored at deep safes 
---
Now, it's not like some dude's computer was hacked and the bot code retrieved, but having some experience in the matter of motivating groups to sustain incredibly boring action over long periods of time in support of collective interests I find the "small group of dedicated players ... with meth addictions ... who also happen to have copies of unique bookmarks which can not be created under existing mechanics and warp to those locations regularly to patrol for citadels" explanation rather lacking in credibility.
---
It is, however, trivial to explain this pattern with python injection, as the client is aware at all times of every citadel in system.
---
I'm not your pal buddy
---
You're losing the specialization skill damage bonus as well, yes?
---
Woosh
---
I see, but is there that much of a big difference between them that people would want to use faction weapons rather than t2? 
---
At this point I have a decent understanding of the game, but this really doesn’t make sense to me, so I’m trying to understand what’s the hype about exactly.

DED runner here  from 3/10 to 6/10 . for me is important to use t2 gear.  armor modules or shield modules are fine if goes to faction/deadspace.
---
If you hang in tether and it gets removed, you are still tethered until you break it yourself ...
---
To elaborate. The faction weapons won't benefit from the specialization skill so even if the faction weapon has the same base damage multiplier, it will never surpass t2 I  term of damage. 
---
This will mostly help smaller gang pvpers. If you're having trouble fitting the higher end t2 like a heavy pulse laser, you either downgrade to the smaller tech 2 or you use meta weapons. Now you can choose to use the faction variant still get the t2 ammo like scorch and not have to downgrade. 
---
And for the people saying that it's not truly an option because of cost inefficiencies, if the person can afford to fly and lose the faction weapons then it is a better choice over meta or downgrading. 
---
At ships for sale there?
---
then use the t2 gear

---

---
Why is this PL/Panfam aligned keepstar allowed to exist so close to Esoteria ? Vily making back stab deals again ?!
---
This is not true - Takes a session Change of some sort to get untethered 
---
I see, now I get the idea behind it, thanks for that :)
---
Haha good one :p
---
Whenst you ascend, words are longer.
---
It's going to affect high end fits somewhat, like a really nice solo Vargur or Golem that Tikktokk used to fly (IIRC the Golem had Caldari Navy cruise launchers), due to fitting space restrictions. It's not going to affect the ever day user since faction guns are just so damn expensive.
---
Now, if there is enough demand for them, then obviously the market will adjust and drive the prices of them down BUT there is an artificial price floor on them due to the LP store from where faction guns are sourced. For example, the Caldari Navy Cruise Missile Launcher is sourced from Caldari LP stores and costs 30,000 Caldari LP plus 12,000,000 ISK plus some some Fed Navy Tags and a T1 launcher (Making the total cost of production about 63M ISK if you buy the stuff off of Jita Sell orders). You can also buy a 5x BPC from the stores but the input prices are triple (90,000 LP &amp; 36,000,000 ISK). So at the very very very least, the price floor is 12M ISK for a faction gun versus buying it off of Jita for 2.3M ISK.
---
In a lot of cases this is more than made up by higer base damage multipliers ...
---
OK baddie.
---
Missiles have the worst T2 ammo of all weapons AND the faction launchers have no upsides other than Magazine Size.  
---
This is an upside to all weapon systems.
---
i just bought eight domination 800mm repeating for my maelstrom before the price surges
---
Test server
---
they have a higher damage multiplier, so they'll still do a bit more. the main thing is the much lower CPU usage though
---
Please stop killing braincells wally
---
No, only if they have same or lower damage multipliers. But Faction and for sure Officer have higher damage multipliers that T2 weapons, so the 2% per Spec level wont turn it around.
---
you do you man
---
Yeah... i was reading this and thought, isn't that the case?
---
It'll be a tradeoff between fitting vs damage, I think.
---
to be fair, its why they invented the turret on tanks.  that way they can still fire.
---
I wish your posting would stay in abyssal space
---
(not really though)
---
Into the Abyss expansion I think it was called.  Almost a year ago now IIRC, and yes, they work very similarly to Vaal orbs.  There's a limited set of items that can be rolled (off the top of my head: props, neuts, webs, points, damage mods, buffer mods), with most buffs/debuffs limited to a +/- 20% range.
---

---
I genuinely can't tell if English isn't this guys native language... or if English is his native language and this is still the result.
---
tbh faction 720 was already useful on some unique xlasb loki fits, but this will not change much for that particular fit (since you very rarely want to load quake/tremor in smallgang loki)
---
but there are definitely some guns where this is a really big change
---
Well for titans it's just because there big. Can't really make that a no go because you could just be waiting to jump.
---
This is a good change. Faction weapons will finally be a good choice when you need more fitting without sacrificing t2 ammo. By gaining more fitting, you lose a slight amount of dps (specialization skills dont apply to faction weapons) which is a good trade off.
---
I expect as they become a viable fitting option, their prices will drop as there will be consistent demand for them. Plus people arent going to ignore putting them up for sale. I know i have some faction weapons sitting around that ive looted and not bothered to put on market as no one is buying them.

---
&gt; anyone hanging in supercarrier for longer than minute will have their **docking access** removed and ~~become free to shoot by anyone.~~ 
---
Fixed that for you. If you are already tethered, removal from the access list does not remove any existing tether, only your ability to dock or receive a future tether.
---
Faction Guns have better damage multipliers than L5 T2 ammo skills.

You can find Azbels easily with combat probes. No need for bookmarks, or to warp around. So it's not impossible. We found a bunch of his Azbels in time, so you don't really need bots for that.

What’s the best way to make money in a combat ship? VNI ratting only makes like 60mil an hour, I think, and I keep hearing about blazing(what is it) and now incursions. What type of ship do I need to run them and how much can I make?
---
Faction weapons currently don't sell great, which means people don't put them on the market, and scarcity results in less market competition, ie higher selling prices. With this change making them a viable option, more people will pick them up to sell, thus more market competition, thus the price will drop. Not overnight, but that gap will get decidedly smaller, guaranteed (especially given you can use the faction modules at a lower SP point without thinking of it as a 'waste' because you'll eventually replace them once you can fit T2 weapons &amp; ammo and the current set up means you have to upgrade whereas then you won't be obligated to).

Good Evening,

My name is Bluemelon, owner of this keepstar and position 3 Natures prophet extraordinaire (15% win rate) - I am the only person that can remove the public access to this keepstar, and I don't play anymore. If through some miracle, someone does get shot in a super capital that could dock there and then had their access removed, and can provide evidence, either by screenshots or video or anything else, I will buy you a new super, and a spare one as well.

and yes, I have the funds to do that.

My other post addresses this, there's already a price floor for faction weapons (sans the Triglav weapon as it's not sourced from an LP store but the BPC is a drop from Abyss sites).
---
The price floor at it's absolute lowest is still 12 million ISK, even if you don't take LP into consideration and ignore the other inputs required (Opposing faction tags). As it stands right now, it takes about ~50M worth of opposing faction tags + 12M in LP Store ISK sink to obtain a faction weapon. This will obviously go down in price as the demand for opposing faction tags increases (mini mission runner buff? FW buff?) but the hard floor is still the LP Store sink.
---
The peoper way is to duel your alt, you won't get concorded and you will not be suspect.

How come FoF missiles don't shoot your own ship?

---
Finally!
---
A tiercide pass on guns would still be nice.
---
True, although the other side is that if demand increases for faction weapons in lieu of T2 weapons (which are barely profitable to craft as it is), less people will be making/selling T2 weapons, so their price can rise a bit. I'd expect more fluctuations in that market, as people will drop in and out depending on the profitability of building, but there's definitely scope for them to rise to meet that floor.
---
For the cloaky camping one make it a infrastructure upgrade, the infrastructure if constantly scanning for ships, if the cloaky has been sitting in one spot for too long it's then visible dscan and you can scan them down

They can leave a cache there with a jump clone and not have their character baby sit the titan or super now... Anytime a cap brawl breaks out in the region they can drop within a few mins even if deployed elsewhere.... so yeah, def helpful.

Becauae t2 does more damage if u train t2 skill up...

well gallente would work too

Yes 60m is accurate. No idea what blazing is, unless were talking smoking weed lol. Blitzing is a tactic used in lvl 4 missions when you try and get easy quick missions and hit as many as you can. Hard to tell how much you make as most of it is in LP that fluctuates. 
---
Incursions require a group and a battleship preferably faction. And honestly ask google. The avg income ranges from 10m a site in 10 mins to I think 90m a site for HQs not sure how fast you can clear those tho. We were hitting assaults for 45m a site. In around 10-15 mins with caps. 
---
If you want to make money tho go hunt ded sites. Lewt is worth more than any tick usually.
---
Jump Freighters, Blockade runners, DST.

If I can't cover the collateral, I'll send them a nice mail saying so. Otherwise I'm used to hauling uniques, so I'm not worried.

Either scouting a head, jump freighter or just save my self all the hassle and pay someone who has everything already setup and knows what they are doing

Missiles have the best facton launchers of all weapons AND the faction launchers have no downsides besides cost. (Faction Launchers actually have more DPS after factoring weapon spec)

Now, as a thought experiment, let's replace "wardeccing" with "A chinese player warping to the next anomaly" in the phrase "[x] sustained 23/7 for months", as the two are essentially equivalent in terms of commitment and I would say the former is much more likely to happen as it provides a benefit directly proportional to the investment of effort for the individual players in question.

Then, repeat every claim you can think of or may have already heard with this substitution, and tell me with a straight face you're comfortable with the explanation.

Specialization III is enough to make T2 deal more damage.
---
I didn't check all of them but the faction turrets have ~4% higher damage multiplier (or same or. It varies by module). The skill gives +2% per level.
---
You cant silence me you buff rorqual furry
---
Seems so.
---
It would be a small change, not even affecting me personally, since I don't deal with high quantities of contracts, but I can see the convenience behind it.
---
I have three ideas;
---
1. the bad idea - introduce more contracting skills, increasing your contract size akin to the trade skills increasing your number of market orders. (Bad, because it needs more training time and it would be rather tedious)
---
2. the lazy idea -  just increase the overall contracts limit for each level of contracting skills.
---
3. the meticulously crafted solution - get rid of the contracting skills altogether and tie the contract limit to the market order limit a player can have. If there needs to be some abuse protection, the contract limit could either kick in with one of the larger trade skills, or the contract limit increases only at 50% of the general market order limit.
---
we need this
---
That sounds great
---
You are entitled to dock and have dinner with no risk to your ship.
---
You nullbears are confused in your usage of the concept of risk, particularly when you try to flip it to people hunting you. It's not like every situation in Eve must involve risk. There is no risk of getting hacked to the money in your wallet for example. 
---
Risk goes with reward. As nullbears you have to take a risk because you are generating money. An afk person is not generating anything or getting any reward. 
---
The ones I checked were worse than T2 with III in specialization skill.
---
I very much doubt that the price of T2 guns is going to meet the 12M/gun floor that faction guns have due to this particular change. There's still a massive surplus of both minerals and moon goo to keep T2 guns cheap on the open markets, even if we have an increased rate of ISK inflation.
---
Jump freighters are dominant.  Black Ops are viable too.
---
Most groups have strategically placed structures for navigating safe shipping routes via jump freighters.
---
Travel-ceptors (&lt; 2 second align) are risky, but work for small stuff.
---
Wormholes.
---
I'd prefer to have my notes attached to what I took them on. Corp bulletins are easily overlooked by everyone.
---
For Trig ships this will make a relatively big difference since a lot of people are either not skilled up to level 5 on weapons or fit faction disintegrators due to a bit lower PG reqs.
---
T2 is also cheaper. People aren't going to suddenly go to officer, because they can fit T2 ammo now. 
---
Great, let me check the market -
---
And it's all gone. 
---
do you even know how this game works lmfao
---
Thats good satire. 
---
Nice bait freeport
---
Doubtful. FW / LS will be continually ignored. If it did end up having some sort of Trig ties it might actually be better for it, like maybe a Trig plex, or some combination of BPCs and mats that need to be done via FW and Abyss and can't be obtained in any other way in the game, or something like that.
---
In a fleet?
---
*And so did the* *~~smol snek~~* *hyprviper hiss into the wind* *^(but no one cared)*
---
One of the big things about FW though, is that you do not have to reside to partake. You can jump in / out.
---
&gt;And for the people saying that it's not truly an option because of cost inefficiencies, if the person can afford to fly and lose the faction weapons then it is a better choice over meta or downgrading. 
---
IS there a buff to faction weapon drops or LP stores? I cant see how the tiny supply of faction weapons would make the cost balance in any way more favorable for faction weapons then skilling through injectors for t2 or for downgrading and buying a complete second t2/meta fit setup.
---
does this offer extend to uniques?
---
How so?
---
What about tracking??? Faction missiles have a sweet spot for application. I wonder if faction guns have similar...
---

Replacements are few and far between.

Correct.

---
You know what would truly solve all the problems in the game to a really mass extent ? Delete delve with everything in it. Seriously. It would fix the entire game for everyone else in all regions alike. WHs, LS, HS and some parts of NS.
---
There would be less whales, less bots less incentive to bot cause no goons means no need to pump as many caps supers titans, less cap proliferation, less AFKing, less content denial mechanics, CSM would be more evenly spread and game would take on better direction, economy would have some drastic swings but then actually recover and people could thrive.
---
That would be really a fix. Seriously. This one group has such an extreme and negative impact on **all** areas of the game its not funny. I don't understand how any devs in any game can let it get to this point.
---
Yeah, it’s why T2 guns are still better than Concord for caps.
---
Increasing demand for something generally doesn't drop the price
---
Best way to get good fleets.
---
what does IIRC mean?
---
But all ~~risk increasing~~ good ideas are ~~spammed~~ memed into being nerfed and/or removed by the ~~killboard warriors~~ fine pvp players who are afraid of losing their ship(s)
---
It is hard to predict, price will go up till supply increases, as suddenly they become a good option. I think you can get them via LP stores? Might be time to empty my LP. 
---
If anything the prices up to the announcement were probably too low because almost no one buys faction weapons.  The LP store offers are largely not good when it comes to buying single weapons, and in general that is how they are offered,  the weapons that have 5 run bpcs available often aren't the meta weapons anyways. 
---
True but a lack of demand means the price is set all willy nilly because no one is interest in feeding an empty market.. Its like trying to sell a chimera.. No one wants it . But you eventually sell it anyways 
---
Theres always someone
---
Huh, interesting. I've never really looked into faction guns, I'll have to play around with the fittings.
---
Eh? You can jump gates and dock if you are scrammed, but not if you are agressed.
---
&gt;I've been running T4 Abyssal sites now for a while and I was making decent profits. Although of late (last few days/week I've only been making 150 mill over each 3-4+ hour period) my profit has significantly dropped, I also haven't been getting as many multipasmids. I also have to have noticed a small trend reoccurring. The first couple of sites I run seem to have better loot.  
---
&gt;Has a anyone else had this happen? Or have I just been really unlucky.
---
With regards to mutas and loot in general, I think its just RNG. For me I get bad RNG streaks lasting up to 2 weeks. This very significantly affects my income. Then it comes back up. 
---
Second part is what type of filaments do you usually run. This affects income greatly because if you have to buy exotic / gamma / electrical, they will stack up real quick. I tend to run fire / dark so if I do have to buy any additional ones they're dirt cheap while I can sell off any exotic / gamma. I also hold onto electricals and once I get a stack that is big enough of T4s and T5s, I switch ships and run them, but I neither buy nor sell them except the lowbie ones that are useless to me, T3 and below I sell off. 
---
This helps out with income a lot.
---
Always always fully flesh out your ship fits so that when you multi buy after feeding you won't forget something silly like ammo.
---
Eh over a long enough metric it does. Initially no. The demand will surge above the supply and drive the price up. Price will hang as high as it can for as long as it can off the back of that surge and then it will have to drop again as consumer awareness grows and the trend shifts back towards sensible price-per-dps.
---
If anything this could see a rise in the cost of T2 launchers. Those of us with maxed out spec skills on all our weapons see no real benefit from this. 
---
I don't need the fitting. I have all the skills. It's cheaper to fly T2 lauchers, Fire T2 ammo and lose it all right now... 
---
Until they stopped being produced in favor of navy issue this, that and the other thing people are slapping on ships they shouldn't be flying in the first place because they are 37cpu short off the killmail fit they downloaded and have no idea why....
---
After all their character is only 4 days old... How WERE they in that blinded out bhalgorn.
---
Don't worry. There is currently no problem with bots, farming, skill injectors or the CSM. Everything works as intended. Look away. 
---
Doh, you're right, I forgot about that.
---
It does when there is nearly 0 demand and no competition.
---
Faction weapons are expensive because there is little movement on the market. Which means only a few people are actually listing and competing for pricing.
---
I know people are sitting on stocks of these weapons (myself included) and havent put them on the market because there is no demand and they most likely wouldnt sell for what people are asking. Or take forever to sell.
---
Now that they actually do what t2 weapons will (with lower fitting), with only a slight dps loss. There will be demand and all the people who have waited for this will start putting up their stock, increasing the amount on the market which will lower cost due to pricing competition.
---
CN cruise are one of the few weapons with a BPC available and might actually stay reasonably steady on price.  Made a lot of isk selling them back when everyone flew ravens in missions. 
---
Yea. Well it goes kinda inline with what they did with Permafrost and Guardian Gala unfortunately.
---
And those sirens only travel about 150km in 10 seconds, whats wrong with that?
---
And lol dumb nanofags who wanna solo a super in an atron.
---
They should just adapt and evolve, because they are CAPITAL SHIPS, and in IRL capitals will shit on your speedboats. 
---
I spent hours mining for my super so it SHOULD dunk any dumb subs that come into my safe space.
---
well, i meant that it will be in fleet ofc, stays at range and can basically hold 10 targets on grid
---
Along a similar line of thinking, I think that all defense oriented citadels should have a market system by default, which operates on NPC broker rules (owners have the right to disable it)
---
The market module is then used only if the owner wants to collect fees
---
This will massively empower marketers to create new markets organically in frontier regions
---
But what about when the large groups do the same to the small groups.   
---
that you think t2 module production and faction weapon production are related is hilarious 
---
Also, tbh, the root of all problems is you.
---
Do you need said people to roam? Probably not. Do you need to Krab for isk or can you do it better? Probably. Are you not taking the time to prep right and having to do rework? Well get better.
---
You can fix most of these things by shifting your mindset, aka, don't buy into the null blob bullshit of Krab is life.

WTB the ability to afford enough skill injectors to inject a Titan pilot from scratch, then buy a Titan. I am not even poor in EVE terms, and this kind of shit makes me think some people have too much money to spend on plex/RMT.

Don't know if you've already done this, but doing all the career arc missions can be quite lucrative.  Decent ships and modules for completing missions, plus exposure to a lot of different skill tracks.  I missed some of these when I started, and I've learned quite a bit even doing them later.

If you like mining, join the CASMA chat channel.  Friendly group of miners, and usually a fleet-boosted mining op running every day.  Good way to earn some iskies while building skills, and you might make a good corp connection.

It's all the things you said though. I'm not saying every member is always ready for everything all the time, but the expectations are higher. Travelling? Don't need to, you're more agile, so you can deploy on a whim with a couple days notice right into the middle of where the action is. PVE? Use alts that are set up and positioned for it so its just a case of log in, shoot stuff, log off. Logistics? Get a jita alt, buy stuff in jita when you need it, courier contract to one of the plenty trusted JF folks, and do this a day before you need it.

i'm stealing this link. its a good resource.
---
ah yes, i thought it was for RoF rather than damage. you're right, t2 does slightly more dps, though the much lower fitting is gonna be way worth it in most cases. also for lasers (and hybrids?) they have much lower capacitor use which is nice
---
Well, unless a single destroyer or frigate goes after the drones anyway.
---
I have scanned for Azbels myself and I found a few in my limited time. So it's difficult but not impossible with a few dedicated people, that maybe even get a bounty for each catch.
---
So yeah, if they found all Azbels in many systems within 5 minutes, that's really suspicious. But if they just found say 70% within the 30 minutes, then it might be possible.
---
The only thing that will lower the price of faction weapons is if people start farming faction tags again. Should be an interesting ninja-buff to NPC Null and FW.....

which lore items are you looking for, and how much you willing to pay? (pm me here or ig under the same name)
---
Yeah, Panther is another big one where CPU is tight
---
It helps if you join an alliance with established logistics, then you can get things moved for you at a nominal fee--usually. 
---
Otherwise, there are four accepted ways to move items to null sec. 
---
1. ) For high margin small items (implants, blueprints, a small number of faction items) you can use a travel interceptor; OR
---
2.) For bulk, or large items like ships, at maximum efficiency use a jump freighter;
---
3.) A cargo rigged Rorqual nets you about half the cargo capacity of a jump freighter (a la the poor man jump freighter);
---
4. Far less efficient in terms of cargo space, but better jump ranges, you can use a standard carrier... the ship bay can hold a small number of hulls, and the fleet hangar bay a medium amount of items.

But because its "free" to them. They can undercut you.
---
If I'm not mistaken, autocannons are the weapon systems with the best tracking speed for their size. However, with all the memes (and somewhat legit infos), medium autocannons are considered to be terrible weapons, so you might not shine with them in T3... 
---
To make a good use of them, you'll want to have the Heavy Assault Cruiser skill trained to the highest you can, because that falloff bonus is going to help you out greatly. A web is always a good thing if you need to slow down your targets, but as you said, it takes away a midslot that could be used for either tanking or capacitor capacity... That's your choice.
---
However, the Muninn can be an interesting choice if you want to stick with projectile weapons and T2 Minmatar ships. Basically, you can either fit it for close range with autocannons, or long rage with very good alpha strike with artilleries. And considering the Muninn have it's damage bonus tied to the Minmatar cruiser skill (which is RoF and pure damage, compared to the Vagabond's sole damage bonus), you'll have better damage output.
---
You are, however, trading off higher tracking and optimal range (optimal isn't that great with autocannons, but it's a bliss with artilleries) with less shield boosting, so you might want to fit a bit more tank on your Muninn.
---
Hope this help =)

Frulegur connects to a highsec island but the important lowsec systems are Konora and Odebeinn. Those are dumping systems from the nullsec regions next door. You can buy resources pretty cheap from those systems and import it to Hek. However, you still have to get past the Frulegur camps. 
---
That's not answering anything from his question, congrats.
---
are you sure you’re still trustworthy enough to make that claim? 
---
you literally said t2 weapons would stop bring produced... 
---
[reinventing the meta, 5 years in the past](https://zkillboard.com/kill/32087538/)
---
you are a treasure, bazza
---
The reason I was thinking of something that requires something similar to a captcha is because a bot could easily warp around all day.
---
But even if a few get bots, it wouldn't be the mess that is now with each system in a few regions being cloaky camped so you're idea would be a huge improvement.
---
I always thought that single room deadspace was a boring way to design pvp.  Multi room plexes with at least 2 dimensions would be fun...
---
So say a whole system would start adding sites within sites the more contested the system is.  
---
So a system has 5 gates each with an abyssal pocket.  Each of those connect to 1 of 3 pockets which also have a one way door into a single pocket the secondary rooms all share.
---
I disagree, this is the biggest problem of the game since it was born.
---
The old training before injectors was a natural way to prevent capital and super proliferation, it required patience, planning, and it was gradual so people at least learned how to play before put their toons on the biggest ships...
---
Now everyone whine about capitals, rorquals, bots and so on, but all those things are only consequences of the injectors plague. 
---
Thats not a skill injector problem... that is a RMT problem! But... at least gave u content!
---
You literally take everything so literally to literally make a literal internet argument? Literally? Literally have no clue that someone isn't so retarded that they couldn't literally possibly mean not literally stop but literally slow down or someone literally does heaven forbid **literally stop their efforts of bringing t2 to market vs faction.** The good news is you aren't literally the dumbest motherfucker i have literally ever literally literallied with on the literal internet. 
---
Literally.
---
This is true when all else is equal. But often all else is not equal. I don't know enough to know which direction the price will actually move. But if the modules available on the market are low enough relative to the modules in peoples storage available to go on market then the present situation creates an artificial supply constraint that drives up prices. When someone is the only one offering something in a region they tend to ask for a premium price, especially when the wait on a buyer can require a significant wait. Time is money. High volume lower margin trades can be far more profitable than low volume high markup trades. So if demand increases enough to encourage more people to sell their modules out of storage and more people are competing to sell these units to meet that demand then the equilibrium price can indeed fall. As a noob still working on my spreadsheets I don't know enough to know what the end result will actually be. 
---
That would be randomly during 8 hours per day that might just happen to be when I also play plus a few irregular visits just to be unpredictable.
---
 You are the one with a complete lack of brain cells or else you would see what an unfair and unbalanced thing this afk cloaky camping is.
---
Ok
---
Black frog
---
With pleasure but I can't keep 20 people wasting hours until the cloaky camper decides to take bait and can't risk(the risk being 100% over a few  days) an expensive farming ship when the camper can simply counter it with ships, modules and numbers.
---
So I would do exactly what you say, which is fight him but I need to decloak the exploiter first, am I not right?
---
Wow, complaining about a years-old issue on Reddit actually got it fixed. Thanks CCP! 
---
Run DED sites. Lowsec should give you the ones you can do in a Gila
---
Meh?
---
Or rage?
---
Show me on this Tengu where the afk buster ship made your feel hot.
---
Yeh, in General i wouldn't recommend bothering with Industry as an alpha but its definitely possible. But you really have to look at which items to build.
---
https://eve-industry.org/
---
everything bigger then a explo frig is too slow for exploration in my opinion, some time a t3c if i look for specific sites where i need the tank or something..
---
but if u like it, sure go in a battleship or dream about your faction explo capital :)  just keep the prices from faction capitals in mind  v0v :P 
---
And Mars' atmosphere is only 6% as dense as Earth's, so barely any erosion on that front either.
---
For most manufactured goods, increasing demand generally does drop the price. Manufacturing cost per item drops when total items manufactured increases, and if there's real competition, those savings end up being at least partially passed on to the consumer.
---
Ok so it's ok for you to have a system that allows Intel gathering, movement, setting up off a strike and general disruption off system through ever presence or Intel gathering.
---
Currently cloaking allows a list off things:
---
Risk free gathering off local and d scan Intel.
---
Active on grid Intel  gathering, with low risk
---
Movement around in an out off system with limited risk.
---
Risk free afk avoiding and waiting out  weapons timers engagement timers. While being actively hunted.
---
Positioning for bombing or attack runs.
---
The list goes on and some off these are fine.
---
But there's one thing, what is the counter or problems with cloak that people can use against it.
---
Problems: 
---
Non covert Ops lack speed. 
---
(Only a problem of on grind close to some one or if someone can move in on you spot before you have moved to far)
---
Non covert Ops can not warp.
---
Only a problem if you need to warp an are to close to a hostile to safely get to speed.
---
No ability to attack while cloaked.
---
Doesn't matter in most cases.
---
Counters.
---
Only one, getting close enough to decloak.
---
All most people want is a way to counter cloaking most games have ever a counter or harsh restriction for such a ability.
---
Warframe has energy needs.
---
RTS have detection units or structures.
---
Halo has. Semi cloak that got worse at speed.
---
Is it to much to ask to have some kind of useful counter, that isn't bump randomly into it in AU's off space or wait for him to decloak.?
---
tag prices have largely been up since mutaplasmid rerolling hit from what I've seen that should be a far larger incentive than what I'm assuming happens with the faction gun changes. 
---
I feel like I missed out not being able to participate in FW. It's totally neglected and it's downright sad. 
---
It would lower the lifespan of the game to zero tbh.
---
This is such a bear response it drives me nuts. You are presumably in an alliance, yes? Your alliance can fight, yes? Ok so you have a standing fleet and people in comms. If you get dropped, light a cyno and bring the people in to help you. It's not rocket science. You don't have to sit there and wait for him to drop you with 20 nerds on comms itching to push jump. You just need to organize and have an IQ over 80. 
---
Like seriously, every time I hear someone whining about cloaky camping my eyes roll out of the back of my fucking skull. Nullsec has literally never been safer and there are still people out there crying because there's *any* risk at all remaining. 
---
Please Note that the Amamake Police alliance is not actually amamake police.
---
My 5 thoughts:      
---
1. It would have to be from a completely new LP store      
---
2. You can not transfer Concord LP to it.      
---
3. The source of said LP has to be available in High and Low Sec.       
---
4. Eventually it would be nice to have a citadel module that allowed the missions in Null but cash in only in high or low sec. 1 per constellation requiring an additional IHUB upgrade with an increase in sov costs.      
---
5. Building it would require capital parts like the Orca or Freighter.
---
It seems like it could also use a dedicated cargo hold for "Punctuation".
---
Pyfa is your friend. Also, try using the correct formatting when listing your fits.
---
As to the fit itself, it is way over on CPU, the autocannons have too short of a range, the dps is too low, and the tank isn't good enough. This isn't a C3 fit at all even if you had the CPU.
---
This is the fit I'm currently experimenting with and I already know it needs adjustments and that it is way too blingy, I just wanted the extra breathing room while I learned the ropes in these sites.

You can either have trade alts at the hubs or check here:
---
https://evemarketer.com/
---
I thought that was how Stunt lost his nid in delve, getting scrammed on a gate
---
The iPhone app Neocom II allows you to check the markets and change the region where the product is being sold. 
---
Evepraisal also lets you change the region. At least to the major trade hubs. 
---
https://market.fuzzwork.co.uk
---
Yeah, I already figured out some items that I can make for a pretty good(and safe) profit :)
---
HIC focus points do stop caps from being able to jump gates
---
[evepraisal](https://evepraisal.com/) and [evemarketer](https://evemarketer.com/types/44992) are your friends
---
Toss everything expensive into your cargo and run to the closest gate gamp, jump, pay the gate camp fee, and you're home free
---
Ok I'm kinda new to the game after a long break, if I undock from jita with billions worth of cargo, will I get suicided?
---
Yep. High speed winds, but there's next to no force to them. 
---
(It's pretty much the only thing The Martian got 'wrong'. And the author knew it. Just decided to ignore it ;) With the film, when he'd covered over the hole with a tarp, there's no way it would blow inwards. Air pressure inside would overcome any wind outside.) 
---
yes. 
---
Someone is always willing to kill you for your cargo. 
---
who the fuck survives 20 bombers or whatever until any response can reach back unless in a Supercarrier or Rorqual?
---
Get over your shitty excuses, cloaked camping is a huge problem especially now that it's so prevalent, 3 fucking regions with every system camped and almost nothing to counter them, you think it's not a problem?
---
Go try your garbage worthless advice yourself and see how it works before giving it to anyone else!
---
Did you factor in magazine size? 
---
deported
---
&gt; Ok so it's ok for you to have a system that allows Intel gathering, movement, setting up off a strike and general disruption off system through ever presence or Intel gathering.
---
Yes. Because the cloaky ship is not making money off rats and mining anomalies. Nullsec PvE is the place where the game has to have an inherent risk. Because there is a reward involved.
---
If you make the game risky for hunters of nullsec PvE'ers, then you make it less risky for nullsec PvE'ers. Which means you will reduce the overall risk because there are more PvE'rs than hunters. So you sound like you are advocating for a risky Eve, but you just want to create more safety for krabs.
---
&gt; Risk free gathering off local and d scan Intel.
---
No one except you has ever argued intel-gathering should be risky. I can gather intel from the ingame map, from zkill, from many other places. Again, you are confused and you don't know how the concept of risk applies to Eve. 
---
People argued that intel-gathering shouldn't be effortless. If I go through the effort of coming to your system and actively dscanning or probe scanning, then I deserve that intel. Conversely, local intel is effortless. That's why people argue against it.
---
&gt; Is it to much to ask to have some kind of useful counter.
---
Yes. Because you are asking for safer krabbing space, which is already extremely safe now. Not every mechanic has to have a counter. You can ask for counters to mechanics only if the same mechanic is bad for the overall health of the game. People using cloaking mechanics to come in your system and disrupt your safe krabbing are not bad for the health of the game. They are actually good for it, because risky/unckecked PvE creates all sort of macroeconomic problems.
---
Eh I honestly dont see the demand for empire faction guns skyrocketing. T2 guns arenperfectly fine in almost all situations.
---
Triglavian guns though....damn. CCP needs to relook at faction triglav gun sourcing.
---
Hi, yes, I'm the person dropping you. I know exactly how it works. If enough bombers get dropped on you to fucking volley you then yeah you're fucked, but maybe you should have been paying attention to intel. 200 bombers don't just magically appear in your space. They have to stage somewhere. Do you have eyes in their staging? Nope? Ok that's your fault. 20 bombers aren't going to melt a carrier, super, or rorq before you can be saved if you're paying attention. If we're talking about a VNI or something...who fucking cares? Insure it, overheat your AB and warp away, or die. It's 100m. Jesus you bears are such fucking pussies. There are some obvious counters to cloaky camping - they just all involve doing more than logging in and assuming you're safe.
---
You're in nullsec. It's dangerous. Did you think it was supposed to be highsec? That exists if you want to not worry about hostiles, you know. 
---
It is indeed.
---
dont mean to be a dick but someone with billions(even after a long break) shouldnt really need to ask this question
---
Faction warfare fixed...  Demand for officer tags increases significantly because they are needed ingredients for officer weapons!!
---
Says the guy who doesn't have to do any alliance logistics, probably. 
---
Should get isk payments for doing it...like incursions just with structures
---
How much for the gun?
---
So hypothetically if you joined a fleet to jump to cyno, it'd drop your tether?
---
It's funny because you'll be surprised how many threats a ratting VNI can eliminate with a proper fitting. I was able to almost kill (no warp disrupt, so they warp off) countless kikimoras, obliterate Scythe Fleet Issues, Slip away from neut stratios while drones bash him in.  
---
If someone uses an omega account to cloaky camp that's on them - which by the way is REALLY easy to tell if they're active during your time zone. Look at their killboard, gives a good idea. They arn't at the computer 24/7  
---
Cloaky Camping is a good mechanic because it can also help lower ADMs in systems you want to take. If you're only concern is being able to rat - you can still very well do it unless they have a massive fleet always at the ready to drop. If that's the case, you might want to reevaluate the alliance you're in. Massive Alliances also have their downfalls, it's better quality of life in eve sure - but you also become targets by a lot of people because of the ease.
---
I’m in goons and they have a great moon mining set up. The people are nice to. Just don’t let them move your stuff.
---
Salvaging has been good isk for newbies for a very long time. Sure they can't do it solo but if they are still training up ewar frigs and core skills they can't do anything solo in null anyway.
---
Yes and No.
---
The tags will undoubtedly become more valuable now. But i dont think they were the primary bottleneck. Short of lvl4 mission runners in the Navy Raven's buying 8 faction launchers cause they didnt have t2 skills, or the random solo/small gang dude who absolutely needs faction weapons for fitting, there just wasnt really consistent demand.
---
When i was in FW i looked at cashing in LP on things id make money on and not have to spend a week/month to sell.
---
No one wanted to spend LP+Tags on faction weapons that were going to take months to sell and actually make isk on. For those that relied on FW to fund their pvp, going that long without a return wasnt worth it.
---
100mn VNIs are insanely good. You wouldn't take a ratting fit into combat but anyone who thinks dropping 2-3 bombers on a VNI is going to do very much hasn't paid much attention to drone application mechanics. On top of that they are wildly cheap. It takes about 2.5 hours to fully pay off a VNI with pretty bad ticks. VNI ratting is a hard counter to cloaky camping.
---
You still need to train the skills to use T2 ammo.
---
Sounds like you're in a massive alliance, they come with massive problems. When I was pandemic horde there was a reason why I ratted in Russian systems during USTZ. One I wasn't interfering with them since they were offline, empty good ratting space, less likely to cloaky camp and fleet scouts.   
---
Theres tons of ways to counter cloaky camping, move over a system or fight back.
---
wait for a wormhole....to move bpcs... dude use a ceptor or if youre not poor, a JF
---
You cannot dock in a citadel if you are scrammed.
---
Increasing market volume will typically close the spread (increasing buy prices and decreasing sell prices) as more people come to the market. But increasing demand will also typically raise prices. So it's not clear what will happen to the sell price. (Buy prices should definitely go up though.)
---
I was picturing a fleet containing a single guardian vexor as mass tackle for other ships either economising on several midslots or permitting sniping from what would otherwise have been a range that permitted the enemy to disengage with minimal losses.  
---
On second thoughts, if these drones existed the same logic would apply to so many other hulls with drone capacity to throw away in many contexts that it would be a stupid choice. They'd just reduce disruptors to a solo kiting fit niche module.  
---
And for larger ships smartbombs would become the equivalent of stabs? Eww.
---
So you're telling me a cloaky camper who doesn't have a job or sleep can prepare to drop 30 man bombing fleet 24/7?
---
Thera.
---
https://www.eve-scout.com/thera/
---
Stock the npc station and leave a clone and scanning/transport ship.
---
Wait until the appropriate wormhole opens.
---
Jump to thera and scan said wormhole.
---
Start moving product.
---
Fyi. Bring something cloaky and use insta dock and undock bookmarks. 
---
Does this mean we can't laugh at people with officer guns anymore?
---
No one invited space commies to this discussion. Shoo, shoo.
---
I can fly a Gila.
---
I don’t know how to fit it though.
---
I'll trade cloaky camping for players who are in space when I enter system give me 1-2 minutes of "fatigue" no warping period.  
---
Crying about cloaky camping for the otherside of the spectrum is hunters complaining everyone warps to safe/station as soon as neut enters local.
---
I do T5s with a friend (I two-box) but the Hawks are kinda bling (deadspace booster, faction batteries, faction BCU).
---
I knew this was a shitpost before the first sentence. It's *headquarters*; one word.

---

---
\&gt; You wouldn't take a ratting fit into combat
---
Deadspace 100mn says hi. Dealing with threat profiles increase as your tank increases. Since VNIs tank are based on speed, go faster. 
---
This is like the tip-top fit for 4s (you go active for 5s), but you can scale most of this down to t2 variants and do 3s just fine.

---
A jump freighter is usually pretty safe. Any big alliance will have a jump freighter service that will service your home citadel from one of the trade hubs.
---
What I mean is the faction tags are a source bottleneck. You can only farm them from certain non-FW missions or doing full clears of FW missions instead of blitzing.
---
Yeah thought he was referring to outposts.
---
100mn, sure. 100mn ratting fit, nah. But your point is well taken. The typical ratting VNI still sports self reps and 600-800dps with that amazing drone application. BuT thE cLOaKy cAMpeR is a stupid argument against VNI ratting.
---
Thank you for the information!
---
I can say I tried out for BRAVE, but they were pretty rude and I dare say the chat was a tad racist when I went in there. Not to me mind you, but they felt very distracted and against alpha players / anyone who wasn't "rich" so to speak.
---
I shall read this and study it like a fine cheese being aged, thank you grandpa.
---
Ah, try horde?
---
Do people in your circle know what a kind and generous person you are? Because you totally are and you deserve the recognition for it.
---
If you give me a list of those people I will congratulate each and every one of them for having the good fortune of having you in their orbit.
---
Thank you so much. I will happily build a bunch of these and explore the opportunities Triglavian space affords.
---
Might see more people do full clears if those tags become more expensive. Not like theres lots of people in FW space *sad laughs*
---
This gets brought up pretty frequently. It's a dope idea that would disrupt the status quo in fun ways and force people to be more mobile. 
---
That said, it'd be pretty annoying to need to pack up constantly, and I don't think there's any way GSM would let that fly ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
The problem with that argument is that faction weapons are not actually a healthy open market.
---
In this case, it will, because Stitch is referring only to the customer side--the sell order price.
---
Right now with nearly no volume, many traders do not use their supply because the overhead of selling it (effort, order slots, time, fees) outweighs the benefit of doing so.
---
As this market emerges, volume will increase and trade will become feasible, causing many reserves to materialize as supply to meet newfound demand. This will tighten margins and if the supply and demand meet each other at roughly the same point, it is likely that the price will drop for potential buyers of faction guns.
---
Haven't really played in a while, but I know I have gear and ships spread out between various systems. Think I'm in Jel or something right now just mining, dunno though.
---
Is this a request to have your structures shot? It reads like one. 
---
I'm not scared. Every cloaky camping campaign in our space for the past two years ended with campers running with tail between their legs after couple of weeks. The issue, however, is that not everyone can maintain 24/7 presence, or is concentrated within one tz like we are. Which is what pushes players into mega coalitions to ensure there is always a standing fleet 24/7 and fc ready to drop full fleet of supers. Which is what everyone keeps reeeing about. 
---
As the guy who did the original renders showing off the model, I take responsibility for the mistake - I scaled it improperly without realizing it - but in my defense, I had little reason to realize how wrong I was when THIS was the alternative :P
---
You can also scan escalations down removing the cost of buying bookmarks. You can't sell the ones you scan, but not paying 80-100m to run the site makes crap drops still profitable.
---
&gt;Trottel11
---
do you even know how rebuttals work?
---
You can also scan for Wormholes, and then use them.
---
Lol, just join Brave fam. It's like, 50% guys like me and 50% afk nubs losing VNIs :P
---
3? Triglav confirmed 
---
Something something cant dock in a keepstar because too big
---
Great idea i agree, but what would happen to structures?  Why would i settle my corp down in a nice spot and fight to defend our structures that we anchored if in a month the system is dead and empty?
---
The only thing higher here is you 
---
"It's cheaper to fly T2 lauchers, Fire T2 ammo and lose it all right now...
---
Until they stop being produced in favor of navy issue this, that and the other thing"
---
🤣
---
Brave is such a [fond memory :-)](https://imgur.com/nB9JhPK).
---
I might take you up on that.
---
If i remember from my FW days, a lot of FW plex rats have some of the lower end tags...?
---
maybe at first, but i think that it could be managed over time, the way i see it you would have private mining corps/alliances that are not as concerned with sov and territory control that contract with the more stationary sov holding entities.
---
is that a trig keepstar or what am I looking at
---
Hell yeah!
---
Or a nullified t3 if you have a lot of small volume expensive stuff. 
---
Holy shit
---
Oof... way off the mark...
---
Yikes.
---
imagine someone posting on reddit about an item thats been in the database since 2009 as an early placerholder for new fighter drones before current style of fighters was decided. :O :shock:
---
the return of iapetan?
---
It's two feet pointing out
---
What air pressure though? The capsule wasn't pressurized. 
---
Buying bookmarks? Is that a thing? I can scan anything down myself, so I've never looked into it.
---
Yes. Even the novice/small plex rats have lower end tags. Then FW missions are full of tags if you actually collect them instead of headshotting the objective.
---
The smaller corps should get a little more of the pie. Totally rotating would suck, as infrastructure would have to be moved, eww. 
---
Maybe increase the spawn rates of mining anoms and include more rare moon goo/minerals in them. One spawns in your home system you can get a nice little injection of cash flow into the corp wallet. 
---
That must be a citadel... right???
---
Yeah..........
---
So, huh, why do I get the feeling that the Triglavians are planning on an wholesale invasion of either known space or Drifters?
---
Use the search tab in assets. It lets you see inside the cans. 
---

---
Hello Surplus_Earnings
---
I run a corp where its more a community rather than a business online. We use chat channels for Special Intreset Groups and because we have over 350 people it means we always have someone online that can help.
---
We do everything from solo pvp to mining fleets. If you want to fly solo and do your own thing but have a social element as well then we the place in high sec for you. After 11 years in this game the worst thing is to feel forced into something and used. 
---
We simply allow players to find their own game and help guide people whwn they require it by asking for it.
---
If you or others reading this want something like that then ART5 - Academy of the Unseen Arts is for you.
---
&gt;skill injectors are good for the game, providing enough mangos that snuff can actually catch something
---
Absolutely this. My biggest complaint about injectors is that they have devalued all of the skill planning, and literal time sitting there watching the ~~paint dry~~ skill points accumulate, including back in the day before skill queues when I literally set alarms to get up in the middle of the night to change skills.   
---
That, and this kind of shit should just not be possible. I get the new player argument, and that's fine, but realistically speaking there should be a hard cap... say 25 million SP, after which skill injecting cannot be done. 
---
Yoooooooo it better not be able to dock then 
---
At this point I'm thinking this thing is a new class of citadel that can use Standup Entropic Disintegrators to hit hard against supers and titans. 
---
Given the scale, it doesn't make sense to be a ship - it makes the Avatar look like a toothpick!
---
Well it has engines, so not quite ;P
---
Well or I just don’t give a shit about camper , if u can’t deal with it don’t live in Nullsec.. and if u can’t protect your ratter against some blops well GG 
---
Do what this guy did, and plop down $500 to $1000 and you could be EVE rich too! 
---
Citadels would still be useful for tactical staging and jump networks (once that moves away from pos). And even the engineering complexes could remain stationary. So its really only the refineries that would move around with the resources and the materials then shipped out.
---
Or, the larger sov holders would just power down the moon that is crap this month and power up the good ones.
---
The only ones getting really hurt is the little guy who may only hold one or two moons.
---
I don't know, for a long time I have hoped they would increase the size of capital ships, gates, etc.
---
Keepstars and other citadels were a good start, but I would love to see Titans and Supers just be these absolutely massive things.  
---
Something just bothers me about some battleships being almost the size of a carrier, lol.  
---
Maybe it’s a FOB???
---
It has engines though, Thats what leads us to think it is a ship.
---
Unless its some station / ship hybrid monstrosity
---
Those are some OP drones. 
---
There could still be a set number of for lack of a better word 5 star moons 4 star ext ext. so just because you roll all the crap moons over and over does not mean you will get a good one. If there is a 5 star out there not being mined by anyone.
---
It's been a thing for a long time. Usually there's some level of trust between the buyer and the seller, though, since on the open market you cant verify that it's not just a random location in soace
---
Do not join them. They do recruitment scams and must have chased away thousands of people wanting to go into null for fights and fun just to make them rich and have a laugh at others expense. 
---
The problem with this idea, from someone who *does* structures is the static nature of the citadels required to mine the resources, and the sheer man-hour requirement to rescan moons every couple of months.  
---
A decent mining structure runs over 3b isk per moon (not including ongoing fuel costs).  The return on investment sets a floor as to the value of the anticipated moon yield for whether that structure will get around to paying for itself.  
---
If you consider the implications of this idea:
---
Scan moons, anchor and start extraction on everything over say 80% the yield of an bog-standard colossal anom.
---
Moon 1 comes out - you finish mining it.  It re-rolls for value, is worthless.  Instead of starting another cycle which results in a loss (due to fuel costs over the 8 week period) you just turn off the mining array.
---
If it rerolls as valuable, restart the frack.
---
Over time, the number of moons being mined will approach 0 - worthless moons are not worth mining, so if a moon rolls as worthless, it just gets turned off.
---
Any given moon can end up worthless under this idea... so eventually, given probabilities, every moon will end up worthless.
---
it's not the size that matters, it will stil get dunked by a  small group of speedy bois.
---
&gt; risk. There is no risk of getting hacked to the money in your wallet for example.
---
Mar5meca, 
---
Please QQ more. The only thing that could be more entertaining than watching you flip if this actually happens would be watching you flip watching your reaction if CCP developed better input broadcast detection software and started permabanning people detected using input broadcasting. :D  
---
An interesting indicator could be % of orders than are less than X [time unit] old, but maybe hard to implement depending on your current system, idk!
---
I, for one welcome our new Triglavian overlords.
---
Hey, can you through in a banana for scale please. Much appreciated.
---
oh man ? what ! for how long ?
---
Tus day has been fortold 
---
&gt; watching your reaction if CCP developed better input broadcast detection software and started permabanning people detected using input broadcasting.
---
My reaction couldn't have been happier. This would mean lots of Delve Rorquals getting banned.
---
Only problem is that a nullified t3 cannot be fit to insta-warp, so could potentially be caught with certain insta-lock interceptors at a gate camp; however, I have taken stuff to null sec this way myself, so yes. 
---
it be a hiveship slicer
---
That’s a space station! 
---
something needs to kill those big ass drifter hiveships
---
Oh yeah...I think that changed the in the most recent set of t3 changes. You used to be able to have a nullified instawarp brick. 
---
I'm starting to think of something that falls between a ship and structure, unable to dock but allowing others to dock in it. No evidence for this, mind you, but it's a fun idea that I'm gonna keep in my head~
---
super ratting overrated tbh
---
Faction trig weapons have been wiped off the market. Nice 
---
Mmm yes the much beloved profession of minesweeper in space. 
---
Would it be possible to place it next to a fortizar? i think that could be rather illuminating. 
---
That looks like a [Vorastra titan](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/536840623379185664/563447541660647435/Vorastra.jpg) from Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion, and that thing could literally eat fleets
---
Sounds to me like just another gift for Alphas as the game morphs into something else. Anyone looked in the Eve Store lately? Do we all get a skill point bonus as some of us spent fucking months skilling up to T2 ammo. Fucking dickheads at CCP. 
---
I cannot believe everyone is so happy with this in the comment. YOu are being fucked and you can't even see it yet. I guess when the inevitable loot boxes start to show up everywhere you will be buying them all
---
It doesn't really answer your question, but I'm stating to lose EVE again and I like helping others more than anything right now, so if you want someone to hang around with in high-sec send a PM my way!
---
Actually, Mar5meca_Gold, despite your claims it would not lead to a lot of Delve getting banned. It would lead to Mar5meca_Gold getting banned though, which would be incredibly funny...
---
Let me amend, you getting banned would not be funny, but your vein popping 'grr goons! GRR goons! CCP is out to get me personally! GRR GOONS IS CCP! GRRRRRR GOOOOOOONNNNNS IS r/eve moderators! GRRR GOOOOONS IS EVERYONE!' that would *result* from you being banned would be funny.
---
PS. /tinfoilhat I secretly believe that CCP has the evidence to ban Mar5meca_Gold right now, but due to the fact that Mar5meca_Gold's alt army represents 36% of the total paid accounts in EVE, does not want to ban him. /tinfoilhatoff
---
just order some faction 3200 lube cans 
---
Very easy to bot
---
mobile fort, now the 40 faction fort doctrine can come true !
---
CCp give them out on SISI as part of test participation?
---
In before it's a Triglavian FOB
---
Maybe make an option to turn on and off? My screen is cluttered enough
---
plot twist: this is a mobile Fort, it just jumps into your system and launches swarms of "diamond" leshaks to take your sov 
---
Rip evebet.
---
Perhaps moons don't respawn immediately so that there are always dead moons that have been depleted and a places for a moons resources to move once it is depleted. I understand what you mean about the re-roll mechanic. which is why i feel more of a push related mechanic would be appropriate. Thats just not as easily explained.
---
Nice, Loki?
---
Aa1q
---
The only problem with that is it just increases the total isk generation rate throughout new eden instead of shifting it around. Which will only cause more inflation.
---
They could be undocks instead of engines. In the pictures they look like they have forcefields on them.
---
There are lots of new player corps. In horde you will be given a starter package of ships and skills. These ships are replaced free of charged if you die. A almost 24/7 newplayer fleet called "caretakers", and 90% of are main fleets have newbeans wing with some one in that comms telling more basic things the main FC will skip. We also dont API gate, our only requirment is your character has not been blacklisted from us.
---
Full discolsure we are at war with two of the other new player corps. Eve Uni is all so a good choice.
---
I gave Eve a shot again after playing a few years and taking a near 15 year break. Joined Horde straight off the bat - instantly hooked. Highly recommend Horde.
---
Err no thanks, once was enough.
---
Apart from using the in-game asset tools, there's a third-party tool called jEVEAssets that acts as a sort of power search for your assets, and has some other neat tools/functionality built in as well.
---
Perhaps a Mobile Base of Operations?
---
It’s too big to be a space station. 
---
Clearly a citadel designed to counter boosh ravens.
---
More timers and it takes a lot longer to kill, damage caps, they are a lot easier to control (a pos required one person for every 4-5 guns with a skill that required anchoring 5, a citadel can be fully gunned with a fresh alpha) there's no hard cap on the number you can have in system, its easier to store more fuel in them (if you bother fueling it), they do more damage and have better ewar options, the guns can't be incapped, the ewar stays on after the structure has been reinforced, the stuff in them doesn't drop but instead gets magiced off to lowsec, 
---
I can go on, but let's be honest, pos spam was a shitty unfun mechanic that was somehow made an order of magnitude worse with citadels
---
uh, yeah, i'd have thought of it as something like the other windows/dialogs, where you have a button to open it up in the neocom, and it acts just like all the other stuff you have in there (window stacking, "close" context menu option and the like)
---
So how big is is really?
---
Good idea. CCP should consider small things like this for FW to help newbies get more out of doing it. A lot of FW guys who are new have zero grasp on how to use the LP store let alone using it to maximum effect. 
---
&gt; you getting banned
---
You wish lmao.
---
At any rate you can fuck off. After almost a year of live broadcasting my activity on twitch, I don't take retards who claim I am broadcasting seriously. Neither does CCP or any non-brain-dead Goon member tbh. Over a hundred morons before you have tried that angle. You are not spethial my boy.
---
I'm sure i've seen some other models / images that have shown them to have the engine effects in that spot.
---
Will see if I can find them again
---
SuperTitan. As this thing is unveiled the empires will probably show theirs FINALLY and I feel a massive event incoming.
---
Just my 5 cents, though.
---
I see you are a man of culture as well!
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
They did tese us Player-Owned FOBs....
---
My prediction: the BPCs for these will be introduced with a new tier of abyssal space where caps (or supers/titans) will be able to enter. So you'll be risking a LOT to even have the chance at getting one of these things. I also bet that there will be capital abyssal duels where someone can snipe the BPC from you once you've obtained it.
---
Fuck yeah finally free clones.  Those 2m ISK every time were rather detrimental for my wallet.
---
#poor4life

No, I think that’s a Proteus.

TIL there is no krabbing in wormholes.
---
Hue. Abyssal *dreadspaces*.
---
They should let it use stargates though, just for the memes.
---
New testing might cause the deletion of posts only containing zkill links or images. Do not be alarmed. 
---
Most people that have stuff in null to sell/trade make it there. All you need to move is the bpos and some other random stuffs. Mine locally, source PI locally. You'll still need to move items you're short on sometimes, but in general people aren't moving metric m3 tons of stuff into null.
---
Years and years ago. Models haven't been in game since like three engines ago
---
You think of small things like literacy and grammar. These things become beneath you when you reach the social-economic status i have with our Triglavian lifestyle. You will see the light, or watch helplessly as it disappears from your pod.

Looks like Ronan the Accuser's ship in GOTG
---
I love the idea, but what incentive is there for the big sov holding entities to not just steamroll these guys and take over?
---
Mining a moon once would easily pay for a disposable athanor to throw on it
---
Like ks houses 3 titans max. Sure.

I just joined a large null sec Corp. Is VNI ratting more Isk an hour then running level four security missions in high sec?

Talk to bluemelon about joining oblivion watch with an alt. If people seriously want to help, I might make a dedicated jf corp

It's a fitting thing. Now you can shave off extra CPU/PG without sacrificing other modules when max DPS isn't your sole metric
---
Well, if you plan to gatecamp, most stuff will just crash the gate before you can finish locking with that scan resolution. 
---
That's interesting, risk/reward is very interesting

Can you ban memes on r conservative 
---
Contracts windows is so bad id be better to just drop it and make new from scratch. 
---
 grandmothership ?
---
In 4 days my first pilot turns 10 months old. Steam says I have 3015 hours in game, and I'd estimate less than 15% of that time is me forgetting to close the clients, or cloaky camping while actually AFK.
---
The injecting I did with plex at the start was spent on skills to form sustainable income, and through carefully planned expansion and asset management I was able to find ways to earn 1b a day through in game grind which financed even further expansion.
---
Today I'm an average player that can chuck enough ice in a couple hours to buy a fit carrier for dumb things. And that's less than half of where I earn my money these days.

There is no way this won't be broken :)

Can it cloak?
---
Pretty sure /u/chabanais would have an aneurysm if I did.
---
Okay imagine a structure, but it can take cynos.
---
I tried that already. I know some of the items from that location and they don't appear in the search tab either.
---
Did you know Poitot is the only named system in syndicate?
---
I would honestly like this. It would probably interest me enough to do abyssal space as I havent gotten to drop caps often in pvp situations before.
---
#WHY U HATE FREEDUM?!?!?
---
Because newbro haulers are soooo last year.
---
Still a bit small in comparison to what we know about the Iapetans https://i.imgur.com/BgWdr8k.jpg
---
&gt;As it stands the current supply of materials greatly outweighs the demand 
---
Ah, this must be why T2 prices are
---
*checks notes*
---
...at near all time highs?
---
Maybe next you can propose a sov system based around small-fleet nanogangs.
---
Looked up the fit, if anyone else is interested: https://zkillboard.com/kill/76044334/
---
the prices for most loot has been steadily going down, and filament prices are rising across the board.
---
Yeah i got a couple JF alts and extra isk is extra isk, ill hit him up
---
:( yes sir
---
I started going to r conservative to get away from all the memes from TD. It's similar to pcmasterrace vs pcgaming subreddit. I use pcgaming because it's mostly discussion and crying about epic store.  
---
Yikes, that's the best you could do?
---
/u/BluemelonEve 
---
Do you know any CCP employees in particular I could ask for help with this issue?
---
People have been requesting t2 ammo in faction/officer weapons before alpha's were a thing. T2 is still higher dps than faction due to specialization skills applying to them.
---
Quit yer bitching
---
ever hear of artificial scarcity? when only a few entity's control the material supply for t2 production its easy to force the prices to go up.
---
We need deniable encryption 
---
Too late, I already quit CCP for good.  
---
Roughly the same. Ratting in null is a lot less work though and you can do it on your main account. Scales well with alts too. 
---
You don’t really want to go to high sec with a character that’s in a null sec corp or you’ll just lose your mission running ship to high sec war dec corps. 
---
 So is that the acurate size or is it even bigger or smaller?
---
Who, exactly, in your mind, is conspiring to make moongoo scarce?
---
Yeah, That would make sense. Its too big to not have something special going for it.
---
i guess nothing really, but that's not much different to the way things are now. However I assume large sov holding entities are not going to want to have to move all of their infrastructure around and and keep up with the logistics of the mining operations. which will over time create a separation between large military based sov groups and large industrial based groups.
---
Is this a shitpost?
---
Goons will have a reason to mine again 
---
dwnvot
---
create filter, stuff &lt;1mi reprocess
---
Make it stop 
---
the fuck are you on about, you still need the same skills to use t2 ammo
---
 God I hope they make a cinematic trailer for its unveiling event I don't like the recent trailers
---
hold on to your buttes
---
As shitty, low effort, passe, and obnoxious of a reply as this is, I gotta go to Malcanis' Law. Big groups have way more logistical ability to steamroll everyone out of a region and drop a disposable mining setup. 
---
Little dudes get boned because they're constantly just running around trying to find the crappy places everyone is leaving empty, but at substantially more effort to set their infrastructure back up. 
---
Idk it's easy to make an argument against anything using N+1 I guess, and I absolutely love the idea of forcing people to move around more but I'm not sure how this would be resolved. 
---
hell yeah, another titan down thanks to the wonders of skill injectors.   
---
I thought we had too many titans and supers? isn't more idiots running around loosing them a good thing?
---
9000 IQ retort. I am done.
---
Is it perhaps in a Corp hanger? Check Corp assets impounded etc if you are able. 
---
Yes?
---
Nice!
---
As a next step, can I suggest addressing all the junk officer hardeners? It'd be nice if a lot of lower-tier officer mods weren't objectively worse than 10mil deadspace mods. 
---
You don't have to turn them all into x-type or better in terms of tank strength; they could get a different/niche bonus, like neut resist for blood raider hardeners, or something. It'd just be cool if people never killed an officer and opened the wreck like "oh boy oh boy oh boy, oh, damn, it's worth 25mil in jita"
---
Holy *balls* that fit. That may well be the purest gank fit I have ever seen in this game.
---
Stick worthy tbh.
---
Lol you tell em automod
---
I have only been semi paying attention to this, has CCP placed evidence that this is indeed a cap ship, and not say Observatories? or a FOB?  Or another type of structure?
---
as a cap ship.. yea i know what i'll save up for and lose in about a week =D
---
What i want is counter play, what i want is to reward active cloak users and place risk on being inactive user's.  
---
Safer krabing space is not what i want it has already got to a annoying point, i do not argue that Intel-gathering should be risky it was only a thing cloaking i used for.  
---
Local in null sec needs changes yes.  
---
Safe krabing is not a good thing, but defenders should have some ways to to help defend them selfs as long as it leaves risks, enough to allow hunters to take advantage and get kills and fight but the krab to have a chance off ever surviving or getting revenge through defenders being able to show up and fight off the hunter and its group,
---
krabing should promote  active and unlazy play, you should fight off a hunter because you pushed a button but because they where able to ever avoid or just manged to survive in till help arrives.  
---
all in all cloaking i feel needs to be a active thing not passive thing where you have no way to clean systems off lazy cloakys.   
---
Covetors. Fast train and by having a lot of them jetcanning into a boosting Rorq I wind up chucking ice on each one around every 30 seconds. Ships cost 30m or less, pilots never need more than 5m sp.
---
Sure, it's more click intense than Super Ratting but I enjoy it.
---
mobile fortizar?
---
This is a bad idea and you should feel bad.
---
I can fap to this.
---
It's only a matter of time, you'll see.
---
No, it's not. 
---
Plot twist: it is cut in half by an Avatar warping straight into it!
---
Because then what would be the value of subscription ?
---
mods, sticky this.
---
Im not suggesting anyone is im just stating that its a possibility. Mostly i am basing my statement of material extraction rates surpassing the production rates on comments from CCP.
---
&gt; As this thing is unveiled the empires will probably show theirs FINALLY
---
If you're talking about Iapitan, they exist already.
---
123 o7 dear komred
---
&gt; What i want is counter play,
---
Again, not all play has to have counter play just because you want it.
---
&gt; Safer krabing space is not what i want
---
But what you ask for will make safer krabbing more severe. Did you know 15 of the last 25 (non-awox) supercap killmails in Delve entirely depended on afk camping?
---
Don’t listen to phony delaclor here, the true Toni would never leave his glorious karmafleet flair
---
PushX.
---
Triglavians? Half Life 3 confirmed
---
That would be really dank +1
---
There's one in there already.
---
I think you need to re-read the definitions for "reason" and "fact". Also, you're dumb if you think Trottel is going to take your retarded ass seriously. 
---
so a mother ship ? 
---
Based on my own rolls, there's between a 1/10 to 1/14 chance of getting a good roll on any given module. So you take the cost of the item X and multiply by a number between 10-14. Last I checked, a Toby web goes for anywhere between 15-20bil so you assume the price is somwhere between 150bil to 280bil.
---
earthmothership ? 
---
would break all eve warp logic..........
---
... it's the motion in the ocean that counts
---
Manners maketh man. It should be normal to be civil about it, not only in eve but everywhere.
---
maybe a quick decaying black hole? 
---
Well there are TONS of moons out there first off, I think the reason that we see it so easy for people to get pushed out of the moon mining business is that there are literally published maps of what resources can be found in each moon. So its easy to patrol and check whats going on at the moons in your territory that should be profitable to set up around. In no way do I have all the answers, and im just suggesting that in most things dynamic is always better than static even if all it does is produce more opportunity for conflict between the already established larger groups. 
---
Reason, noun
---
Cause or explanation.
---
I provided one. I still can’t find a reason why you’re such a bitch though? 
---
This is the bad idea salad before the terrible idea meal.
---
Puts out a nice big message that lets people know your worth shooting though
---
This has been a long time coming!  There may be a reason to use faction guns yet.
---
I wonder if increasing the size of capital ships would be a mayor balance factor in big capital fights. Something had to be done to fighters for them not to be OP... but it would be interesting :) 
---
Rooaaaaw Titn
---
What’s the isk per hour?
---
Or a frigate with 3 k/s and 3 ancil medium boosters and a invu window.. geeez
---
**pos code*
---
&gt; bout T1-T5 abyssal sites and the ships to do them in. What I have not seen or heard is anyone doing them co-op using T1/T2 frigates. Some corp-mates and I want to get into it not to get rich but to see if it could be fun to die in 
---
AB Retris are pretty good in them, less then 200m and havent died yet
---

Should have stayed longer in school. 
---
I’m in a small Corp, which is a member of a small alliance, which is part of goonswarm. I feel like I get the best of both worlds
---
For sure, that's sort of the big question right? I like to think in general dynamic is always better too, I just wonder what the consequences of that are and whether we're right about that or not.
---
The way it is now, at least there are still more shitbox regions where the big alliances aren't interested in going, and where smaller groups can do their thing. If it was a more dynamic system, I think smaller groups would still need to find areas like that, it'd just involve them occasionally moving now, which like I said I think big alliances could handle more easily.
---
It's an interesting question, I have no idea what the answer is :O
---
Its a hat.
---
Kind of like the tracking feature but it also always keeps your ship in frame? Yeah 100% this would be awesome
---
Depending on balance between supply and demand prices can go up or down, if demand is greater than supply that means prices will go up, not down as you said. 
---
didn't you quit 
---
ANCIENT ENEMY AZDAJA.
---
Why has nobody pointed out that the majority of gamers aren't going to play Eve as the majority of people are as dumb as a box of rocks?
---
I like this.
---
well not removal off local but a much easier thing that mite work better is afk timers and a off gird setting for local.  
---
off grid meaning disconnecting for local no local for you but you all don't show up in local,  
---
and being afk for to long meaning you drop out off local,  
---
hunters already use d scan and  probes to hunt for targets all ready i don't for see a lack off local effecting them people that still use it get it, while hunters get to hide there presence form them using it for the disadvantageous off not being able to use it them selfs, it also allows some one cloaked in local to despair over time or people that just are not active,  
---
as for cloak counters, yeah if it stops active stuff a counter should not work on them, if any counter is put in it need to only work on the truly inactive, basically you have to be paying not attention at all to have it work on you.
---
makes sense they need to move about in there space and with them starting a war a mobile mother ship sounds better
---
god damnt pos code
---
The X3 games had this feature, basically a picture-in-picture view of your target that you could enable. Could be nice, although have to make sure that it dosen't hurt performance too much.
---
Dammit. I literally just reprocessed about 10,000,000,000 isk of faction weapons not even three weeks ago.... :(
---
Oh well the minerals were useful
---
yes, that was exactly the thing i had in mind :D
---
To be fair it has a fuckton of floating pieces so after it folds it would be titan-sized.
---
Would be interesting (although possibly annoying) for NPCs to take sov in null. Might shake things up for alot of the "boring" space.
---
Tens of billions? You're missing at least one zero there pal.
---
they do
---
They let it go because we are playing CCPs game and we arent cheating. People can say whatever they want, but that's the fact. Your reply, despite your stated aim, is nothing more than the same pedestrian grrgoons shitpile of nonsense that our enemies love to recite as gospel. 
---
Don’t have one from you/them
---
Can I have your isk and ships then?
---
Unless you start from very low demand and an increase in demand then allows large scale production to be set up.
---
Prices can and do fall even as demand goes up providing costs falls more rapidly than said price. And assuming there is sufficient competition. 
---
At least irl. In Eve I'm not so sure.
---
HIC points are different from scrams
---
I like to think when CCP saw your original post they just chuckled that they hadnt been found out yet. 
---
Yes of course. But the thing a lot of people aren't considering here is that faction weapons can be bought through LP. The reason why no one is doing it now is that there is no demand/movement for them. So its a very small group of people that actually supply the market now.   
---
If demand exceeds supply (which 100% it will in the beginning), people will see there is a market in the weapons and start dumping their LP and tags in the LP store and start pumping the market up with them which will start driving prices down again.
---
As with everything, there will be a stability point where everything finally levels off, but because we aren't seeing any actual input from LP, the supply sides "looks" bad now. I feel like we're going to see that turn around once FW and Pirate LP farmers wake up and start dumping their LP into these items and once everything settles, faction weapons will be cheaper in the long run.
---
They already VNI bot with alpha account...
---
Notice how its an amarr drone model, and no amarr ship have a good midslot layout?

Wanna bet these were meant to address that?
---
Best is after you blob the crap outta them and give em a GF anyway to harvest salt. Jk jk
---
The point of high sec citadels is to make isk. Effectivity is thus measured in how much isk you make (per day or per amount of effort). Without having access to numbers on either side, Horde probably made more during their stay because they largely cleansed the area of competition at one point. Test hasn't managed that so far.
---
Measuring an isk making opportunity in whose stuff gets blown up the most is comparing apples to oranges.

I could be wrong, but on hoboleaks there was something about triglavian station,

Alongside invading triglavian npcs,this is perhaps their structure to establish foothold in kspace?

---
The NPSI fleets are loads of fun and there are still ways to have an impact in small gang fights, such as a drones and drain Dragoon.

The limitations on mining means that it should just really be social. The ISK per hour will be pretty awful.

Actually, for meta items (non-tiericieded) reprocess the meta 1 and 2 stuff. Then decide if you want to repro the cheap level 3 and 4 stuff or sell it.
---
I normally just do a preview of the reprocess by item type to see if the minerals &gt; estimated price.

Hope this helps.

Roughly 400m if I refine it though I do then also skim some of the heavy water for more ice mining.

I believe jEveAssets will do this. A buddy of mine mentioned something like that; I had never even considered reproecessing stuff like that.

This is an awesome idea.

Just PUSH it.

Horde FC here.
---
Good fight. Was nice to stick around and brawl. Sadly I was slightly lacking on numbers to stay on grid long enough to save the structure, but it was a good back and forth throughout the engagement. Though I am slightly salty my Recons forgot to point the rev before he jumped out in structure. =(
---
Since the c1 is mostly frigates, the low bs scan res hurts more then the bs tank/weapons helps. it doesnt hurt to have bonused drones, but gila is better in every way.
---
Uhh, how exactly?
---
If you're not using a Webber alt with your freighter, then you're doing it wrong.
---
Hence why I've been unsubbed for months
---
now that is a nice fit :D i wounder how much dps was on it
---
If that also includes strip miners it would be possible to mine more than 45 m3/s with each strip miner on a Hulk using faction strip miners. (42 m3/s if you don't use Michi implant and Aoede MLU).
---
An increase from maxing out a hulk in the 50-59 m3/s range to 84-90 m3/s. 
---
Hey, did you know that it you applied what you've learned in abyssal sites to PvP, you'd probably be better at it?
---
&gt;risking my ship against a challenge, piloting manually, adapting to different situations, learning and picking appropriate targets, making risk/reward decisions on the fly 
---
Same tactics apply to PvP. Skills, luck, and game knowledge apply are the other big factors there. But you're halfway there at least. Come pew pew in null sec and have the best of both worlds. 
---
That kinda reminds me of the story how Lara Croft got such big boobs in one of the first Tomb Raiders. One of the developers accidently entered a wrong value and they just sticked with it.

Since they also fit into shattered c1 they can make nice refit/storage alt scanning boats if you plan on living in one.

Take your time to level scrapmetal reprocessing 5 first if you want to do it yourself.
---
are you sadistic to kill  heron with civilian gun coercer?
---
By your logic, TEST's success doesn't count till Horde fucks off.  Which is pretty dumb.  
---
You're probably too new to remember how things worked before citadels, but Snuff almost exclusively use their supers on alts, which never leave the ship. They don't put their Nyx in a keepstar on their mains like most nullblocs do.
---
Outside of a free midpoint they have no need for a Keepstar, and I'd imagine they have very little want for a keepstar because it ties you down to one very predictable area.
---
When you start a duel it pops up on the screen for pilots on grid not a problem if your in a backwater system different in a populated one
---
Google it, there's pictures. They're low res.
---
now the only missing thing is for you to lower the needed tags fees to a REASONABLE level for them to be bought with LPs to ACTUALLY make them viable at the market.
---
Only on capital weapons I think.
---
I mean, you're using a 30 billion ship to attack a couple hundred million ship.
---
I mean, cost is not a good way to balance a game. Exhibit A:  Eve right now

I'll chip in.

Dodixie was my HS home before I left HS. It’s the trade hub in gallente space. It’s not as good a trade hub as jita or Amarr, but if you want to stay in gallente space it’s the place to be.

Do you happen to know if CCP has ever released this type of analysis?  I've heard this rationale for years, to the point that it has become almost a truism,  but I've never seen anyone "show their work" that supports the conclusion.

All officer mods should have like 1% better stats than any deadspace mod and the world would be fine

Earlier, when he had the airlock blow out of the hab.
---
This idea has been mooted many times over the years, especially by me.  Resources should wax and wane a bit like they do in PI (it's a plasma algorithm which should work across the galaxy). 
---
There are problems with this though, especially the biggest, baddest group of players always monopolising those resources with smaller competitors unable to compete, making the biggest even richer and even bigger.  Eventually you'll just have one big ball of Everyone and one huge locust fleet.  It's how we Humans roll.
---
So on balance, no, this should not happen.
---
I'd also mention Aunia as a great place to run missions. Has level 1-4 agents for federation navy in one station.
---
If you want a vision of what it would look like, see Goons Locust fleets for info.  Hundreds of Rorqs and hundreds of Supers/Faxes rolling out to Querious, Fountain and Period Basis for the fracks, which they clean up in a few hours.
---
It would be like that but on steroids.  
---
for logistics : buy/sell in bulk. Always have ten (cheap) fits ready, when you have less than five of one fit ready, you go buy 10 more. Of course always do that for fits that are cheap,I had only two machs and two rolling megas.
---
Don't sell stuff unless there is several B worth of selling.
---
for PI : setup one week P0-&gt;P2. you need to move it only once every 2 week. if you can, setup one P2-&gt;P4 so you put all your stuff in it and it produces P4 among the week.
---
Krabbing : see logistics. better have 5 fits ready in several places plus a few spare fits not assembled.
---
When I krabbed in null I had one VNI to farm in every system, used an inty to go there from the staging, and a cheap cargohold T1 indus to move stuff when the area was clear. Only had one rattle though to do the escalations.
---
Oh I see what you mean, like when there is a storm and the plastic is fluttering and he looks nervous? Love that movie. 
---
If this happens you have to assume structural changes over and above just the goo moving around.  
---
Says who? I like the game.
---
This would be a helpful change in the current system.   LP stores in general are another example of legacy systems in EVE that are horribly defunct and opaque to players.
---
It's not true though.  It may have been the case in the past when directors owned and "mined" the moons, but in today's more democratic fracking system, ordinary Joe mines fracks, reacts it and tries to sell it ASAP because... isk.
---
depends on your buyback. Typically check if an item reprocessed is worth more at the buyback than the same item not reprocessed.

Look it up, there was a minmatar world ship and a gallente iapetan that sarpati serpentis 'stole' during an event.
---
If you go to the longer video he shows it. With Void it was 1443 cold
---
I get it’s on an alt. I get they can pos babysit a super or titan. Yeah I remember pre citadel. 
---
they now have enough money and power to have super caches and expand their reign. If that one character has 2-3 supers placed in different keepstars with a clone in each you can have better power projection in a matter of moments across the map.
---
I’m not sure how everyone is not getting that. How can they fight In null and 20 mins later be on the other side of eve with caps against Th the current fatigue mechanics...??? clone with caches of capitals. keepstars would a lot them to do the same thing a lot of alliances do but with supers now. Place caches of them strategically. It allows the one alt to be used more places in a shorter about of times. 
---
Does your Corp not have a few dreads placed in multiple locations with clones there for this same reason? You can cover more ground with the same number of alts. 
---
This shitpost has gotten taking wayyyy seriously. Holy hell. 
---
Well its not hard to conclude, just look at the size of fw playerbases compared to nullsec playerbases. Even if all active players enrolled in fw joint up together under one group theyd only roughly equal a medium sized null group (a few hundred active) compared to most null groups out there that have those numbers, aswell as the bigger groups with thousands of players. 
---
Tag for repro, check estimated value of minerals (usually a very accurate measure because of .01 ISK tradebot wars) vs estimated sell price listed for the item. If mineral value (+ tax if applicable) &gt; item price, repro.
---
Caveat if you wanna go full minmax for every cent: if the estimated sell price of the item is within about 10% of the mineral value, I recommend right clicking on it in the repro box and Viewing Market Details. Sometimes stuff will have margin traders driving apparent value down, and there are plenty of buyers who will snap it up at a value within a close range of the mineral value. Would recommend that if there are active buy orders greater than, equal to, or not much less than the mineral value, you just keep the item intact and sell it like that (less space needed to transport it than minerals, too).
---
I'm just telling you what people have repeatedly said on reddit, my dude. What can I say, reddit has some good comedians

Use GHSOL from jita to lowsec then get an alliance mate to deliver from lowsec to your home.

Yeah welcome to wormhole space dinobrain

Pospy, Hawks, hk, sound, novac, all out, oruze, maybe another corp or two.. That holesale eviction was a large part of wh space. And it was like 220 in fleet 
---
Yea, but there are a lot of fans of uninturapted 1 vs 1 in the game, so I understand it.
---
a citadel with an anchor mode like the siege of a dread  
---
Just wait until CCP releases the XXL Citadel with the logic "it'll be too expensive to build more than one of"
---
He tried, but then as predicted wasn’t able to get 100% away.
---
I heard that Dodixie is dying? I’d be fine making the occasional road trip to Jita but I hear Dodixie is now pirate-infested and bad for trading, making it a less viable home? Which of the two I had listed would be better for trading? Or are these rumors false?
---
Also has to be built in the c5, where a rattle can jump in.
---
Locate Citadels so you can pop them? If you pop them, the war becomes invalid. If you like killing their ships, you want to leave their Citadel alone so they continue to be a valid War Target in the future.
---
But yes, the easiest way to hide your Citadel would be in a random C1 and hope nobody finds it or messes with it.
---
I thought the citadel had to be in Highsec?
---
It occurs to me, maybe we've been going about this all wrong. We keep looking at the thing going, oh maybe it's a dreadnought or maybe it's a Titan... but that makes the assumption that it's going to fit neatly into our existing class structure of Frig, Des, Cru, BC, BS, Dread, etc. What if it's a totally new ship class?
---
Why are you still here?

It does people don’t read

The Solteur was a bastard to fight. 300km radius superamartbombs. Despite half of the game trying desperately to snipe him, he got away.
---
Um.. Faction guns get extra optimal range and less capacitor use.  
---
All weapon types will get a theoretical damage boost from this.  Missiles will get extended Magazine sizes that result in a gain in sustained dps at all skill levels.
---
Guns get extended optimal range and less capacitor use.  The extended range will allow high damage T2 ammo at shorter ranges, also a damage boost.

It was a fun stream.

TIT will do.
---
All of MCAV's Citadels are in wormhole space and we're eligible for a war. None of our citadels are in highsec so, one can only assume no.
---

---
On the other hand, light drones are very easy to smartbomb. I could see it being somewhat interesting option if it was limited to light drones only and had scram only effect (so: disable MWD and MJD) with zero point strength (can still warp). Would give interesting option for kitey stuff while still being reasonably counterable (low hp, short range).
---
Probably a placeholder
---
You can import a cap in a c5 from low sec 
---
I havent beared with local in probably 5 years
---
Every system in null would then have a system-wide decloaker.  So what you're arguing for here is the removal of cloaking.  So why bother, just remove it.
---
&gt; After the May release, whenever a corporation or alliance declares a non-mutual war they will be required to select a specific Upwell Structure (only including Upwell structures with docking facilities, not FLEX structures) they own somewhere in highsec space.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;This structure will be designated the “War HQ” for the war. If the War HQ leaves space for any reason (such as unanchoring or destruction) the war becomes invalid and will enter its 24 hour cooldown just as it would if one side lost their war eligibility or if the attackers fail to pay the war bill. If the corporation that owns the War HQ leaves their alliance, the war involving the alliance will enter the 24 hour cooldown and the new war spawned between the leaving corporation and the target will continue to be valid.

I lived in Cistuavert for a while too before getting bored... next move was to Iyen-Oustra as being a couple of jumps from Jita but not in the forge was advantageous but this was pre-citadels etc ... in short pick a base that suits your main activity... if its pve and missions then a spot that has a couple of L4 missions will work well, but imo whatever you do operate beyond your home base.

\*Wave cannon intensifies*

Stacmon is nice... close to a LS system chain and good for missions with an ok regional hub.

Here's a thought experiment. What would happen to the balance if these things were added into the game and made only usable by Triglavian ships?

Wait, it isn't? Then why do the mining laser things spin?

Thats Definately Not True.

Honestly, it'd be nice but I don't see that kind of love being given to us.

What are you using for your visualization in the top pic?  I know there are a few programs floating about, and ive even made my ownish one.  I was just kind of curious to see what still exists and is up to date.  I think caldariprimeponyclub's Jeremy stopped working and so did EvENT's Model viewer iirc.
---
CONCORD ships? They get range bonus for points/scrams (50%) and webs (100%), this web on a Marshal would have 47.5km range before heat/links.
---
I live 4 jumps from Dodoxie and never have trouble buying/selling there or in the citadel in the next system over.
---
Because I love the schadenfreude.
---
Put an app in with your name on the context 
---
I can’t wait for someone to use this as a bowling ball to a cluster of caps that are tethered and the resulting video to follow. 
---
Sure, it makes a broadcast. But again my question is why does it matter if people know who is your webber alt? Most people are doing it anyways, so its not an indicator that you have shiny cargo or not. And if you do it right, your freighter warps in 1-2 ticks
---
Its not may yet though.
---
It has all led to this.
---
????
---
How are moons generating isk?
---
I have this weird memory of an old, old clip of eve with a custom ui, and the locked target was shown as a video of the targeted ship instead of a static image, I think it was a stabber in the video. 
---
Has anyone else seen this or am I mental?
---
Well right now  the Supra Veles is at 150m in jita haha
---
Oh it looks like you're right. So do they tell you the war HQ location or do you gotta figure it out?
---
They are not a problem. Literally they're a drop in the ocean compare to ratting bounties. Yes I have run incursions when they've spawned in our space. It's good fun running them in a super. 
---
You have to have a competant FC. You have to have competant triage. You have to have comptent capital pilots. You lose tons of fighters. If you want to make real money you have to multibox. All of these things factor in to incursions. Verses Joe Dinobrain who can literally undock his shitfit super and make 300m an hour. I know you made lots of money on the last one, but that happens what? Once maybe twice a year... maybe a few more times if you're super lucky. 
---
I can remember a total of 3 incursions in our space since I moved in over 2 years ago. You're kidding yourself if you think they're remotely comparable to ratting.
---
Who said anything about multiboxing? We have enough Real People Rollers to just roll out and do it.
---
The identity of the War HQ structure for a war will be public information available in the war report window as well as sent directly to the defenders when the war is declared as a reminder.
---
Fed Navy lube best lube. You know hoe those Gallente are
---
This will be changing dude.  L2read
---
This is an interesting idea, considering things like ratting carriers exist. 
---
Tama.
---
If I set a ship to autopilot to a destination very far away, can I log off and have the ship continue its journey so when I log back in it has arrived? Thanks! :)
---
Everything changed when the firemothership attacked. 
---
My only issue with this is how you handle the ones that are already better than the best deadspace. (Draclira EANMs, for example, are better than A-type EANMs, and priced accordingly; a pair of 'em for the molok will run you 100b right now.) When buffing every officer mod to either x-type or above-x-type status, you have to either give another extra buff to the current top-end ones (making them stupid crazy powerful), or make it so they offer no real advantage vs. lower-level officers. 
---

So people are only able to use their space, if they're able to defend themselves doing it? Doesn't sound that bad to me
---
At this point ... i can't connect the dots... i am trying but it still orbits ... "do i know you?" :)
---
Currently, it can be anywhere (a customs office in a WH, a teeny citadel in deepest null). As of May, it specifically has to be a) dockable, and b) in high sec. 
---
Ive been trying to do this but they've usually left by the time I've gotten my hurricane there. How do you avoid this?

Fair point. Cant be bothered to imagine a solution but everybody agrees purps need to be better than deadspace

Go to Stacmon. It has a small trade hub (obviously more expensive than Jita or other big trade hubs but has the stuff you'd usually need but can't be bothered to go to jita), it's highsec (0.6), has it has direct connections to other highsec and lowsec, and it's 2 jumps away from NPC null (Syndicate).

Meh.
