There's rumours that they're adding NPC city ships in the deepest parts of nullsec isn't there?
---

---
I wonder how they're going to pick the systems to acquire for it. Probably just flood several options with NPCs and the first ones to fall get NPC sov'd.
---
---
---
Ofc it is. Dude, I have no idea what you are saying. A counter can always the same.
---
Eh okey? 
---
No they fking dont. Its BS. Can they kill everything ye sure, but so can a frig. In reality they track like shit nowadays. Try flying a cap and you would know. 
---
Then dont fight people who are bigger than yourself.
---
Ofc there is, happens every day. People fight under umbrellas against caps and win on a daily basis. But they bring the right tools for the job.

That would be pretty awesome. A true pirate ship, and the BPCs for it should only drop in LS.

people maybe should show up in actual brawl fits, would be even more fun
---
Every bloc has a kb up now lol, welp looks like that delay lasted what,  a day?
---
I think all space's sec status should be changeable. Why is CONCORD paying out billions and billions in bounties in nullsec if the space isn't getting any safer? If no one is getting bounties paid out in a system, the sec status should get worse. If bounties are getting paid, the sec status should get better. That on its own would make space much more dynamic in how it gets used.
---
yeah because eve with zkillboard is more dynamic than having it shut down or delayed and hunting for nothing :)

Since CCP's attack on holders with nolocal, and it's mind fuck of players, I can't see my way through enjoying the game that I have enjoyed for many years.

Either the company got greedy, or their idea of fun isn't the same as mine, I am still uncertain of continuing the game.

I enjoyed the building and the mining, and now solo mining is out in owned space at least for me. Maybe not for the suckers. So I am not certain where to get from here.

I too agree that we should get rid of all RPG elements in eve
---
What a punny line
---
Whilst Mordu's in game are Cal/Gal, because of the lore surrounding Mordu's Legion, looking at the bonuses and roles it's pretty clear that was meant to be Cal/Mil.
---
People do it all the time
---
you're not wrong
---
LOL nope.  All the big blocs put up their own copy already.
---
Just thought oh, the CEO is Asian, seems kinda suspicious...

I’m willing to pay for something good

maybe because intentionally making your service worse is retarded
---
Define "something good" from your perspective.
---
What do you want to know and how much is it worth to you?
---
Lore is more important. And yes. That shit works. Caldari with some wild ass Intaki shit. It makes more sense than Caldari/Minmatar because the lore. Read it.
---
Would be really cool if as a lore event some empire castaways turn to Triglavian tech and start modifying it as an entirely new pirate faction. Unsure how it would *differentiate* itself from any other particular ship, and the Trig ships themselves have balance issues, but it'd be cool as fuck
---
What do u have?
---
Monopolies certainly do exist within the markets. There is an entire game within a game just in market manipulation within high sec, but to be effective you need to have a pretty hefty amount of cash to get started.
---
Unfortunately, in terms of smuggling, there isn't really anything like that. People use capital ships to transport goods in null sec which effectively bypasses any blockade by jumping right into the desired system. It sucks because it complete removes any substantial risk to resupplying far flung systems. 
---
As someone else mentioned, doing exploration is probably as close as you are going to get to a smuggling type experience. Everyone around you is going to be hostile, for the most part, and your goal is to go where the exploration sites are valuable, get the loot, and get out alive. Like Indiana Jones with space ships.
---

Now why would I give that card away. What do you want to do with trading and I can see if we can come to an agreement.

I enjoyed the building and the mining, and now solo mining is out in owned space at least for me. Maybe not for the suckers. So I am not certain where to get from here.
---
and from now we can say "remember about that Vanquisher?" :)
---
On the other side, keeping +5s as the expensive but marginally better solution to accelerators could be interesting option for people who either don't mind switching clone every time they're about to undock or keep their pods relatively safe (Rorqual pilots etc. - since crystals don't affect capital reps anyway) while still providing the nice feeling of scoring a jackpot every time you get to snipe said pod. But +1 to +4 could be better off being replaced with accelerators (maybe available via LP stores in place of basic attribute implants, to not kill value of empire faction LPs).
---
doesnt make it any less of a copy / duplicate

in other words, camping HS holes and loosing expensive t3s/strats

I miss the days when drugs were illegal and had to be smuggled

Sure it was cancerous but the thrill! The excitement of carrying contraband across Empire space!

I dv because if you don’t know where this is you’re bad at this game and should reconsider hobbies
---
That's literally what I was thinking before I thought about the lore aspect, and the fact that all faction ships have WEIRD bonuses not in line with normal/navy bonuses. 
---
The only reason for this shit is Interbus as an excuse, and if it's not QRF it might as well be a set of faction haulers.
---
&gt; Two areas that are notoriously safer than nullsec.

C5 dreads aren't safer than Delve.

Among my proposals there are actually fixes to FW missioning.

Make sure this isn’t an undercover sting operation as the dialogue reminds me of a classic Cops episode.
---
Delete all capital ships
---
A region of space isn't fucking hostile by default either, it's friendly to us because we live there and hostiles don't (or not many).  
---
But lets continue to ignore d-w beacon, the multiple wars for delve, and the fact that no one is contesting the region aside from small gangs killing myrm ratters and excavators, and just blame the game for how "easy" it is to live in delve after years of hard work, monetary investment and time investment.
---
Go fuck a rake buddy ;)
---
Sounds like more man
---
I have read the lore fwiw and I wasn't disagreeing with you, no need to strike such a rude tone.  
---
  
---
Mordu's ships were designed as Cal/Mil before they had assigned a faction to them: Mordu was simply the biggest NPC faction that hadn't been assigned a ship line yet (why do you think Trig's were a whole new faction, because all that was really left was rogue drones/EoM).  
---
But they couldn't realistically assign Mordu's ships to be Caldari/Minmatar when in the lore the Minmatar and Mordu's have no link, whilst Gallente and Mordu's do.
---
But, in practicality, we have a ship line that shares traits of Caldari/Minmatar, even if it technically uses Gallente skills instead. If Mordu's ships didn't exist, so we *didn't* have fast missile boats, I'd argue for them, but as Caldari/Minmatar *basically* does exist, I really think there's far bigger issues in the game right now than what skillbooks the ships require.
---

Is it still "free" if it takes skill, knowledge and a lot of time to extract said info?
---
By kill history and evewho/character history you can get tons of info, including but not limited to likely alts (including cyno alts), character/player affiliation, active timezones, approximate place of living and possible activity time (corellate zkill activity with known national/local holidays, local internet issues, other big events in the past, look for trends that can be explained by probable realtime events etc.) - virtually any kind of data analysis you want; as long as you have kill history in either easy to process or easily searchable form and Google access.
---
&gt; A region of space isn't fucking hostile by default either,
---
Nullsec is supposed to be high risk/high reward by default. "Living there" shouldn't entitle you to 3% risk in a balanced game.
---
Like 4 Titan pilots and Titans? I'd rather have them in 1. Even if it's a factor titan.
---
Was it ever gone?
---
When you have a 500b isk ship you want to show it off.
---
I've played eve sitting in the passenger seat of a car driving across Colorado, if that counts.
---
Haulers that could shrink their mass a % per level for wormhole logistics could be cool. Or maybe one that can fit a module to exclusively allow combat refitting. Or one that somehow becomes bonused for travel the more gates are taken.
---
Just hard code everyone's attributes at 30 flat and change "regular" implants to be navy implants with weaker but universal bonuses.

Reminder this was announced 3 years ago &lt;/3

Thank you all for the nice Procurer roam. I had fun and a blast. happy Birthday Princess Abbie.

Start with navy faction destroyers first (and after that the pirate destroyers). Why these still aren't in the game while Tranglevian already has T2 destroyers, is beyond me.

can confirm on expensive bombers

---
D Scan doesn't work against cloaks and recons... so sometimes you are just shit outta luck.
---
Space itself isn't friendly or hostile, it's THE PLAYERS that make it that way. Things rarely die in space without other player involvement. That is the reason Delve is "friendly" space, because there is very little player threat to the region, and when there is, we deal with it, or the ship dies.  
---
You used to live in a wormhole with your russian friends, what was your "risk" in there? Did you ever even get ganked while ratting? Did you not dscan and roll holes to prevent the loss of your ship? All of these things reduce risk, but reducing risk is part of the game, no matter how many shortsighted cyno changes you want to cram through because all you do is live in Delve and not experience the rest of the game.  Your optics are so screwed you have to blame goons for brigading your posts instead of trying to look past the little fishbowl you're living in and understand that a lot of what you're suggesting will affect wars, fleet fights, pvp engagements and not just allow you to gank ratters.
---
definitely man, 100% worth a shot. And if you have a hard time justifying the 75m/ship when going out to die a lot, maybe give the federation navy comet a try. I have a fitting for that ship which flies identical to the hecate, just lower DPS and Tank, but it's still a beast and only costs 31m? Something like that.
---
I genuinely think all the pirate factions should have more unique hulls. Especially Serpentis.
---
&gt; Just don't be the fucktard Logi who throws out a whore drone, locks a fleet mate, and goes blue on blue.
---
Translation please....

?

I've watched freighters get ganked and it takes no where near 50.
---
Great video! Great idea for a fit!
---
That thumbnail looks like a guy swallowing something.
---
Not all slots are turret or missile slots. A mining laser requires a turret slot which means you have 2 high slots but only room for one turret.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
That also tells us you're trying to use a hauler for mining. Don't do that. Apart from the, now, obvious single mining laser it doesn't get mining bonuses. Use the Venture instead, it fits 2 lasers and on top of that gets mining bonuses. With a massive ore hold.
---
Honestly had no idea about the ceo lol
---
In the fitting window you have High slots.  To the left and right of these slots at the top are little circles.   
---
These indicate how many turret or launcher hardpoints you can fit.  You can have more high slots then turret/Missile hardpoints meaning you either have empty high slots or utility.   
---
The Corvettes may have othe rrestrictions applied as well.   
---

It’s just a spin on the name because not a lot of people view them as real worm holers
---
This was the most wholesome exchange of the week lol
---
Mining Lasers (not the Strip Miners) count as a turret - exactly like a gun. 
---
The ship you are fitting only has one turret slot. It may have many launcher slots for missiles, but those cannot be used for Mining Lasers.
---
CCP should balance the game they have.

meh stop flexing bro and go outside
---
&gt;Is it still "free" if it takes skill, knowledge and a lot of time to extract said info?
---
Yes. The fundamental problem is that CCP makes killmails publicly available without allowing those involved a say in how it is used. This is unethical and bad for the game.
---
Can you push through my "Freind that's non't not my spy" please   
---
Thx in advance bae
---
Rens or Amamake
---
Logistics pilots will sometimes carry a "whore drone" (damage drone) so they can get in on the killmail.  Sometimes, that logi will throw 1 whore drone and 4 logistics drones, set ALL of their drones on a friendly pilot to send them reps, and not realize that their whore drone is hitting the friendly pilot.
---
In addition to what Aktilos said, the Astra was placed so that the Keepstar undock points directly at it, so as soon as he undocks he's already aligned to it and will enter warp the moment the fleet warp is initiated.
---
It's usually a good habit to flag exempt from fleet warp in a capital the moment you join a fleet (while still docked) for a number of reasons, this being one of them.
---
I'm not seeing it, where is the guys face?
---
Except they aren't publicly available until they get shared by either the killer (person who got final blow) or victim (person who lost a ship), either by ESI or manually by posting the link. CCP doesn't make kills available if neither side decides to post them somewhere.
---
THanks man! Very glad you enjoyed.
---
&gt;A counter can always the same.
---
No, because then you basically end up with one type of thing because nothing else is better.
---
&gt;but so can a frig. 
---
Okay. 100 frigs kill 100 carriers? No.
---
&gt;Then dont fight people who are bigger than yourself.
---
So avoid the problem and pretend it doesnt exist.
---
&gt;People fight under umbrellas against caps and win on a daily basis. 
---
And lose on a daily. You do not consider the filtering that happens before such a fight is taken. if a fight is taken, and they win vs caps, those caps were likely expected or the fight doesnt happen.
---
Thank You!

Actually that's essentially how it works. There are many other variables that aren't accounted for as well. I'm really happy you have exposed yourself to everyone in these last few hours of sperg and shown light on what brain damaged level of thought is behind all your suggestions. It's remarkable how incorrect you are about anything EVE related.

Go do something else in EVE and maybe you'll develop a different opinion. Go start an alliance and take space or some shit, I dunno, but you need to broaden your experience.

I might find myself in the same boat soon, haven’t played since 2012, I’m worried I’ll login knowing nothing and immediately get my battleships blown up doing missions :). How’d to reacclimatize?  Join a Corp yet? What do you tend to do in game ?

I haven’t played Eve in ages, my character was before alpha vs omega was introduced.  I haven’t paid for a sub or logged in in ages... Is it possible to take advantage of some kind of 1mil skill boost invite  for my existing old character ?  That link makes it seem like it’s only for alphas.
---
They cannot be publicly available before they are publicly available. This means the issue is always when they are publicly available. Never when they are not.
---
If CCP had imposed "access restrictions" in the form of omitting information based on the wishes of players, you would not see the same claim. There could still be a killmail, but certain info would not be there like name of victim, destroyed modules, maybe damage, specific ship, etc.
---
&gt;CCP doesn't make kills available if neither side decides to post them somewhere.
---
They knew the "winner" would want it made public and that providing an API would result in just that. They are far from neutral.

I do agree about the bomb range. Coming in for a bombing run makes sense, dropping one from 100 out and then cloaking like a bastard does not.
---
It didnt, those rorqs are personal assets and cost the alliance nothing. The supers not deployed for combat were effectively personal assets and not of any use to the alliance since they were clearly not engaging with the alliance.  If they had been they would have known the umbrella was down and they could expect no help.

---
Everytime a Rorqual undock in nullsec, have it automatically transferred to a known CODE. system in high-sec. Don't allow them to dock, so they have to safe log. Watch the chaos ensue.

Fair point. I’m still not used to how things work in EvE. Were it any other game I’m familiar with this would be the act of a crazy person.
---
&gt; Space itself isn't friendly or hostile, it's THE PLAYERS that make it that way. 
---
No.
---
Nullsec is more risky and more rewarding, regardless of player activity. Hisec is opposite. That much is inherent to the very Eve design. You can see lots of trailers mentioning that risk/reward balance.
---
You can make null a bit more friendly with organization, but you shouldn't make it safer than hisec. That just breaks the game, and we have seen that happening last 4 years.

I can only assume it’s work equipment?  If so, this got even better!

| Provi formed a large Munnin fleet with practically double the logi in t2 variant. Kinda unfair but we didnt care.

They pinged for fast response, and I think there were just that many because others were already forming in 9uy for other targets.  The provi fleet went directly on after the fight and engaged two or three other incursion groups. o7

It can be done. There are lots of badly fit proteus in W space such as this one, but make sure you research your target before engaging. Overheat neuts and try to coast out to the edge of your neut range. Ideally you will force him to use null. If you see a cap battery on any of his previous fits, probably not a good idea to engage.

You buy them like any other ship. The only difference is they have something called subsystems that change how they behave. Those have to be purchased off the market and skills have to be trained to use them.

No crafting just takes 20 or so days to train the skills for the subs which should all be at 5 for best use of the ship.
---
Do you have a link to one of the “subs” on eve uni so I can see what skills need to be trained ? So far the Tengu itself (as an example) just needs Caldari cruiser 5 as the long 30 day train ...
---
I would say though, if you are new, t3c's seem really nice, but I would stay away from them until you have some pvp experience. They are expensive and you lose skill points when they die
---
link???
---
Um I dont know eve uni site very well, but if you look in game and go to the tengu info page, under stats there should be links to all the sub systems and those will tell you the skills you need
---
Well realistically a Myrmidon or old VNI would pay themselves off after just 2 sites, so even if they lose their ship after 3-4 they've made profit and don't really care.
---
Bombs can’t be do damage from 100. Typically launched at around 30. And if you cloak before damage is applied you do 0 damage.
---
If you meant torps you can maybe get close to 100 with javelin, and info links since you can’t lock that far.
---
Maybe you should get out of the asteroid belts sometime, PVE NPC.
---
rmters dont deserve respect
---
bro, did you just make that up for this specific comment is had you heard/used that before for similar situations? That's the fucking funniest thing I've read in a long time.
---
Yeah this is a good idea, quill is fantastic at putting himself in the shoes of a total beginner, and explains everything very thoroughly. Cannot recommend him enough, even for other games he plays!
---
Maybe asset safety for Fortizars and Keepstars in K space since they are "outpost" scale structures, and off for everything else since those are POS replacement.
---
Problem there is that rogue drone sites are used to give SOE ships...
---
Ok , so do you take in consideration in you're profit loss column the ammount of accoutn who don't farm and are just connect to defend ? 
---
Can you also add the time for manage this organisation ? 
---
Just stop think you're "3%" are correct. You want true number ? wake up and count loose in war in foreign region/export to , beacause to have peace you make war outside. When we move asset and you kill it in LS for exemple it's an itnereption of ressource produce.  
---
If you really want to know in March the imperium pve/mining loss up to more of 10% (only goons make something like 12%).  We are far from you're 3%.
---
If you want to play with number to said something stupid with it i could start to make no scientific math and analysis and proof Imperium looze more isk than they win.  It will be totally false, but with as simply argument as you have it will work. 
---
Ho and i can also withbad scientific number proof to you HS have a loss of 0%.
---
If you want to use number pleaze use number with scientific argument.  When you have make you're graphic, you have explain how you have make it. But he doesn't represent what you said. That the true problem. 
---
For you losse are only pve/mining ship destroy, you don't take in consideration all other aspect.
---
BETA!
---
Damage bonus.
---
I see what you did here.
---
Just give the widow old style ECM
---
&gt; If it's destroyed, your assets should be given a 15% chance to drop into the loot pile and then face the already used RNG to determine if it is destroyed or dropped
---
Rather than the RNG, just bump up the cost of asset safety to 25% and have the asset safety isk pay out into the wallet of the unanchoring corp or the corp that got the last hit.
---
i just want normal scanres LUL
---
excuse me for being rood, but you are a dickhead. This is how you deserve to be spoken to.  Sucks when someone at your level has to cut the actual piece of shit you are right back down to size.
---
I was never aware their quality isn't great (but then id never paid particular attention either). Another poster likewise offers them the rag.
---
Did Hek die out as a hub then?
---
I see. They could do away with the hyperbole.
---
Basically I last payed eve around 2012/13...  mostly got into battleships running l4 missions if I remember correctly, but never got around to unlocking t2 or t3 ships, so wondering would it would take to get there.  I assume Tengu would be relatively safe running missions in hi sec. .. mainly just curious  about getting into the game, but want to skill up into something interesting that would be fun and tough for a variety of activities. I’m not even fully aware of the activities these days :).  
---
I recall the last super fun ship I had experimented with was a stratios, it was tough enough to barely do lvl4s but I also enjoyed the cloak mechanics and taking some minor risks doing PvE in low sec with it.  Also drones were super powerful, the meta in my day.. not sure if that’s still the case. 
---
Any advice would be wonderful :)
---
Self hosted are horrible for intel gathering. This is because only your people are gathering the information. Third party ones such as zKill are the useful ones for finding fights around New Eden.
---
With that being said, I support the delay.
---
Ok, yeah I see If I cant head over and make the suggestion. I admit I think it makes great sense - to have a Market Index like Industry.
---
or just shut the servers down forever, and watch the the salt flow like never before.
---
I have a better idea.
---
You have a ship with a laser range 1000KM , and call "golden ammo" who one shoot every capital of the game.  Totally balance.
---
No really before maje that kind of proposition pleaze stop thinking ganking pve and/or miner is the only thing in this game. You use cyno for a lot of other thing, and make this will just kill a lot of other game play. And trust me you don't want that.
---
Bonus points if it has 300m mass and can fit in lowclass WHs
---
Listen man. This isnt going anywhere. You have your opinions and I have mine. Lets just leave it at that.
---
I honestly cant help you there. I basically exclusively pvp and have never done a mission. But all I can say is find a corp that does something like that, or ask people you see running missions. Hopefully they can give you some useful tips. I have killed people using t3c's running missions, so I assume they are good at them.
---
Killed them in hi sec ?
---
There is already access restriction - kill is available to only two characters and their corps and remains private unless someone already having access changes that and publishes it somewhere. It's like that since killmails exist (even back in the day there were actual mails, having "Read mail" XML API access allowed any 3rd party tool to read said kills). And here is the thing: if they are published, they are published will full info, there's no "partial kill info" available, you either share everything (including potential information you'd like to hide) or you don't share it and hope for other side to do the same.
---
&gt; They knew the "winner" would want it made public and that providing an API would result in just that. They are far from neutral.
---
Actually, it's usually losing the fight that has no negative consequences (outside maybe your reputation if you care about killboard stats) for publishing the kill - you already lost the ship and sharing the intel about it with everyone else around doesn't hurt you at all (and has the potential to hurt whoever killed you if someone's watching over zkill - consider this as public "hey, there are guys you might want to kill, everyone"). From hunters perspective, it's very common to not have APIs on zkill and hope your target also doesn't have APIs up (which, funnily enough, is quite common for renters etc. since they often don't care too much about killboard stats), and publish the kill only after you safely cleared the grid and got yourself safe.
---
Zkill info is something you (any anyone else) can play around if you know how it works, and you can even use it for purposeful disinformation with a bit of effort. It's entirely possible (and not that hard) to build fake believable zkill history in order to hide actual purpose for an alt to be able to move it around without causing a lot of suspicion - because random Buzzard with core probes and no killboard history is much more scary/suspicious than random Buzzard with core probes and few months of losing exploration ships. Yet nothing stops second one to end up as a warpin or cyno for a gang that's about to forcefully free a supercapital-class vessel from the fate of being a ratting ship.
---
I know this amount of effort and planning isn't necessarily what everyone wants to do in order to gain an advantage, but isn't that exactly why it's good? As just yet another tool that allows someone who wants to put a bit more effort, a bit more time and planning to get slight edge over someone else, with very high ceiling of what you can achieve - and usually ending at "not worth the effort to continue" instead of "did everything possible".
---
&gt; Nullsec by default is more risky and more rewarding, regardless of player activity
---
I would debate that since many of the "most rewarding" activities aren't available/advisable in sov null, things like Burners, L5 missions, sleepers, and safe Abyssal Deadspace. What it does offer is decent isk/hour for low effort, high population density, and good ability to keep enemy big stuff away. The downside of this is that these attributes make sov null the easiest place to bot, and it's rewards can not be increased unless it's resources are made harder to bot.
---
Most T1 battleships suck balls.
---
wow you've been sitting on this video for a long time huh
---
GNI is garbage, CNI is not much better, Rook sucks, Compat Ceptors at all shit...
---
There’s plenty of unbalanced shit in the game atm.
---
The SRP fund is there to ensure that SOV is kept, its the cost of keeping the lights on. And the risk is lowered by paying that so why shouldnt it be accounted for?
---
Better ways to get access to pirate faction tech would also be reasonable.  
---
Maybe the pirates can spawn dockable, destructible upwell stations with special features relevant to interacting with the faction's interessts.
---
I can't think of any reason why they shouldn't have a stronger infrastructural presence in lowsec.
---
Lol. Bet he didnt have this many opinions when he was at risk.
---
I said from the start that the Rorqual should have used Fighter mechanics (various special abilities and periodic reloads required to maximize yield) instead of Drone mechanics.
---
Eve devs should limit Intel whoring prove me wrong you can't
---
I finally got around to actually testing this.
---
03:40:22	Notify	You can't cloak because the module Medium Micro Jump Drive is active
---
Hmmmmmmmm.
---
As much as I want capitals it's not that I can afford it either way, and probably it's better to only add subcaps now due to balancing issues. I for one will not be opposed to a shield tanking version of the Triglavian ships...
---
Master Race Fax is a racist term created by TEST Alliance Please Ignore to refer to their blingier combat FAX fits. You can read all the information you need on your own alliance forums.
---
Hes not. I mean, not all his suggestions are bad but they are small scale perspective. And he really doesnt care about any other perspective than that.
---
 A ship with a bonus the negative sec status is a good idea....reddit will not stand for this!
---
Fair enough.. thanks legend
---
It's more about people figure the ship will always pay for itself before it eventually explode. A pure PVE fit VNI can't PVP that well either way, though a few modifications would make it a deadly bait for some careless hunters, at a cost of isk/hr. And if your enemies' number is more than one it's quite possible you are dead before you or your friends can even react. 
---
So it's not whether you will lose your ratting ship --- you eventually will, but that they are always "already replaced!" Paying more attention to ratting will make you rat faster and safer, but it imo disproportionately increases the effort.
---
If you like active PVE, try abyssals, running DEDs (by scanning or buying locations), or get a carrier at least. A carrier is especially useful even if you don't use it for combat at all, as it provides a good way for you to travel with your stuff around nullsec.
---
Rens and hek.  However heks 9 jumps from jita threw low sec.
---
&gt; I would debate that since many of the "most rewarding" activities aren't available/advisable in sov null
---
Scalability (per account), afkability, accessibility, low effort etc. all goes into my concept of reward, not just isk/hr. Null is decently rewarding when all this is taken into account, which is why people do it.
---
Density or "keep big stuff away" goes into the risk side of the equation though. Which makes it a low risk decent reward activity. While I argue it should be more like wormholes, a high risk high reward activity.
---
Dont think so.  I was able to fit out a couple of ships in hek no issue.
---
I'm the CEO
---
 New to Eve - When is making something loose or tight relevant?
---
Thanks for the help!
---
People on reddit can't spell he meant lose.
---
Never. Once you become an Eve player those words stop being relevant in your life.
---
Finally we can fake Killmails again, and Hedliner will loose alot of shit !
---
e L i T E   Small Gang Community : "We need that Blackout to save the game"

---
Dammit, now I have to change my shorts.   It's gooey, sticky, and somewhat uncomfortable.   If I just ignore it it will stain and I'll have to peel  my junk off my leg.
---
Boosher you just need to know how to click a button when the FC asks. Move it to F1 position and I know you will do great!
---
Natural selection is a beautiful thing
---
The entire risk/reward talk is basically about the very inherent mechanic in Eve in which people go out take risks for money, and then occasionally die to other players. That's basically where most of the daily content begins. That's how players interact, explosions occur, and Eve becomes a vibrant universe.
---
The moment you can "pay off a sum" to reduce risk of dying to players, that's no longer risk. Thats risk mitigation. Imagine you could hourly pay a Concord "bodyguard ship" to instant blap my attackers. That wouldn't be taking a risk. And if you want to name that risk, then that's not the kind of risk a balanced Eve needs as such a game would not be vibrant with player interaction at all.
---
One thing I noticed is that people don't use hot keys to run modules or check D-Scan.  Its a big time saver.
---
&gt; Like 4 Titan pilots and Titans?
---
yes
---
&gt; I'd rather have them in 1
---
why? even a 5 year old can box titans
---
Most correct answer.
---
Horseshoes and hand grenades. LOL! In this case.... just grenades...
---
This was an absolute blast.
---
Train into a confessor and find a c13 wormhole. You should make back the cost of your ship in about 20 minutes.
---
So you just use your remote reps to keep the logi bots alive right?
---
“Losing intel is only okay if it’s intel I don’t actually use!!” - /r/eve 2019
---
Name one good wormholer?? Exactly nome of them
---
Please tell
---
Probably someone with an bot army who made him rich but not get good
---
You don't need repetitive input to balance something. Making everything in the game cancerous to do is not balanced or conducive to fun and just promotes botting.
---
Mostly likely we'll get triglavian marauder (given other T2 ships we've gotten), so then drifter blops CCPls!?
---
I dont fucking care, I want my covert ops dictor
---
Was wondering when those marshals would go poof
---
you forgot your /s
---
Let's not forget the guy just got killed in a stratios, so he clearly knew the gang was around. Some people just aren't very smart. https://zkillboard.com/kill/78236496/
---
He lost his tiamat last month, and now his vanquisher, what of his faction caps and at ships will he loose next? I know he has a vendetta and I belive a revenant too.
---
Honor is for idiots. If the fight's fair then both of you fucked up.
---
The answer to EVE anywhere.  Now you have me thinking...
---
Do you know him? We were seriously confused by the whole thing lol...
---
Eve has too many ships already.
---
I wish I could kick people from my sur name
---
This seems more like a credit card warrior. We killed him several more times today and it doesn't look like the dude has much in game experience. If he knew enough to set up a bot army he'd probably know enough about the game to not make so many rookie mistakes in one day.
---
As usual, great choice of music. Hope you are feeling better.
---
Nah I dont sadly. He drops them all the time. It's really entertaining though. 20 bil wasted but i guess if he wants entertainment it's 2p bil well spent
---
I’d call that risk vs reward.
---
Holy fuck Sanshas BC PLEASE!!!
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
I mean that's always been the story of every change that gets demanded
---
I've been back in EVE for about a month now, and recent decided to venture in LS more often, and EVERY time I do I hop out of my training implanted clone and go jump into my clone that is out in LS. I honestly hate it because I lose 24hours of decent training time, but I guess that's what I get for going into LS?  
---
If I had the spare ISK I'd just buy snake and the other +5 that had the extra bonuses and just run them because it would be better for my PvP experience. But I'm not going to risk 1b+ pod flying sub 20m shit-fit frigates/destroyers.  
---
If there was a constant 1000sp/hr (is it per hr or day? I don't remember) for alpha and like 2500sp/hr for omega I'd run 100m in implants that boosted the effects of my ships. But I don't want to lose training Implants, I'd rather lose combat implants.
---
i have a nemesis that can solo hit out to 150...
---
He's a good boy and joined a standing fleet - just happened to be the wrong one.
---
Interesting.
---
hmmm that looked fun sadly i wasnt around then.
---
Well.... zkillboard is by far the most popular killboard there is so it does make SOME sense to delay it there. I agree though, it doesn't solve the core problem if large blocks can just create their own killboards. Needs to happen on ESI level.
---
This was deleted, can you PM this to me?
---
"I swear to god Greg smartbomb my drones one more time and I'm replying you with Hammerheads"
---
Well they don't enforce it at all. I'm sure they like the money.
---
First rule in my crew is "don't feed". That said, our leader is so bad that we set up a website to track his tengu losses and fuck with him about it every chance we get.
---
Is there a way to select multiple items in your hangar and just take 2000 of each for example? Rather than shift-drag on every one and typing in the amount.
---
Until they get smartbomb awoxed by their own fleet again.
---
The closest you will get is running a courier service for a nullblock/wormhole group.
---
Why? The delay works and if you post the killmail manually it still works because you chose to give away that info.
---
True. Anyways. All the major organisations will have alternate methods for collecting killmails bypassing the delay.
---

---
Only their own member's KMS so, Shirley, it's not the same thing.
---
Probs but I run scram in mid
---
In literally the same system.
---
Post it manually lel. Wtf is with people in this thread don't they know how to post killmails to zkill?
---
Would be more beautiful if it were goons and the slope would end at 0
---
Never not upvote a Frat kill. Good fucking job! And the scam contracts too! LMAO.
---
Before zkill, killboards were more for tracking stats, reviewing battles, etc. Now killmails are for intel gather which is not good for the game imo. I'd gladly go back to regular killboards because they were not only fun to customize but also because it prevented this intel gathering meta we're in. People should play EVE, not look at webpages to play.
---
I see you still completely fail at understanding anything out side of your own little bubble. It’s absolutely useless to explain things to someone so dumb and so self absorbed in the belief they are right about anything. You should really consider exploring outside that little island of yours, it will ultimately be your undoing if you don’t.
---
I feel honored that you join us, kappa
---
So far I have been keeping my head down.  I had a very nice random person help me a bit, plus a friend who still plays the game (though rarely) give me some isk, and I sold the Twitch skin.  That all netted me enough of a bankroll to go into trading.  Nothing great, but a few million here and there.
---
The Twitch thing oddly,I mean am grateful for it, added the bonus skill points to my existing account.  I guess because my account was so old I had never been part of F2P?  Anyway that took me way over the cap for Alphas, but I had that free Omega time to use.  That let me skill up pretty fast.
---
Like I said, I am still mostly keeping my head down.  I have been trying to read up on a good corp to join because I do eventually want to get back into PvP, just after I have 4 or 5 ships ready as I imagine I will go boom a lot :).  I was all over as far as what content I did last time and I think that is why I didn't stick with it.  Trying to be more focused now.
---
We're at over 450b and 100's of ships killed. When you're dealing with an alliance in the 1000's there are always those who will make mistakes. Remember though that there are fake standing fleets as well as fake fleet invites, plus we spam their own alliance renamed as test alliance with the instructions to right click, block. It only takes one mistake and you're eating shit on our citadel.
---
amazing vid as usual
---
sometimes i wish you would keep more of the comms in it to really give us an idea of what goes on in an organization such as yours.
---
He's implemented a 2 hour delay in kill mail processing, from automatic feeds.
---
“Your effort-investment/per person is really low compared to people trying to kill your ships”
---
This is by far the most insane and dumb thing you have ever stated. We all have been doing the shit you started doing last year for much much much longer and just no, you are completely wrong on an astronomical scale. It requires a whole lot more effort to establish what we have and maintain it than you just jumping to some dudes cyno. This is why everyone thinks you are an idiot because you are completely clueless to anything more than undock, right click, jump. You just don’t get it, at all, this is why you are a meme candidate and not taken seriously.
---
not gonna lie the init lances were really well aimed. They missed cause of booshes but even getting them that well aimed is really hard
---
Awesome
---
Thats hot
---
Wait what the *fuck* did I miss in the lore while I've been winning EVE.
---
Link removed, can you reinstate the post? People were having a decent discussion
---
Well if we go weird, maybe covops cloak and shield resistance.

Basically a counterpart to the Amarr/Gallente SOE ships, without the focus on exploration.

hat gons
---
It's unbalancable.  I'm not trying to be a smartass or anything, I'm just saying that the idea that there is some kind of ideal combination of stats and mechanics that could be arrived at and wow! now the game is "balanced" is obviously wrong.
---
I have only been back myself for a short while but it feels very similar for me. Same regularity of big fights, same access to small ones. The local changes have made the universe seem a bit bigger. I'm enjoying it a lot so far.
---
correction.. we got richard in any ship to do that
---
Extremely overused dead meme alert.

But nullblocks bad why would you want them to automate it?

angry serb? hello?

whoa buddy calm down you might cut someone with that E D G E.

Cool, thanks! That's exactly the context I was wondering about.

At the time, I tried to tell them that they outta keep it simple and stick to NPSI, but they didn't wanna hear it.
---
We had two carriers that's it
---
You cant get tackled doing this unless it's bait
---
none as far as I know. The drop rates suck, the salvaging gets taken if there is any at all. It's not a very good event (ongoing thing?)

Fun fights to be had.

Cba to discuss garbage ideas
---
so i guess I'm better off investing in a incursion ship
---
I welcome you to bring 2 carriers into the SV5 smartbomb camps and see how that goes for you.
---
I am only saying that lack of ESI delay simply allow this if you just have ESI from your members.            
---
Nullblocks are not bad, bad are ingame mechanics and lack of variety of space that could promote various game play styles.
---
what blows me away is the bitchfest going about a group of dudes flying against another group of dudes who they're friends with. tbh, i'm sure they don't give a fuck about how YOU feel. but continue.
---
wait im late, what did you prove?
---
Well yeah that's what I said. Having esi info from your members is a fair workaround to not having zkill Intel. So everyone should be happy even with delayed zkill.
---
Considering that T2 Logi Cruisers already give a 100% bonus to Logi Drones and they're still pretty weak, I'd really love to see that bonus bumped up quite a bit and perhaps the Shield Booster bonus lowered.
---
You need total access to everything everyone does to filter spies.. and just look how well that works. At this point handing out ESI access is just a private data breach waiting to get sued for.
---
Higsec/lowsec?      
---
I think the 3/4 are locked out for T3 ships ....          
---
Also what racial DED's.           
---
My first 5 choices :

* gila      
---
* orthrus      
---
* stratios
---
T2 pirate ships with niches that fit the faction. Angel interceptor. Black Ops Nestor variant, which CAN fit a covert ops cloak in addition to covert bridging.
---
Ban them from getting full access to ESI from everyone.
---
but people just create local killboards and using spy alts inject ESI from other big groups to it.
---
Anyone know why pirate destroyers aren't a thing?
---
EWAR Drones need a blanket buff before a ship gets dedicated to them, otherwise that bonuses would need to be insane before it could be considered useful. EWAR ships usually sit far off so the EWAR drones would need a huge speed bonus, a huge signature reduction, and huge bonuses to effectiveness because of stacking penalties making a flight of them worse than a T2 module on a good bonused ship.
---
SoE T2 Marauder-style Battleship with a Triage Module
---
&gt;do you want to do that without boosts or compression on Omber in high sec?
---
Luckily enough, you'll always be able to find a Veldspar belt so you don't have to do this on Omber. Because due to market demand for tritanium, the most common asteroids in the game are also the best mining in High-Sec.
---
So you're gonna put an alt in every corporation in an alliance individually? Lol fair enough you deserve the Intel if that's your level of commitment.
---
*Interbus Poco partybus
---
*Has infinite POCOs in hold

*4% Shield resist bonus to Caldari industrial level
---
why is that worth posting
---
Cynabal is good as is the Vagabond. The other options lack the free high slot. I'd use autocannons, because you fight mostly against frigates.
---
Yup you guys got fed.
---
Yes it was good fun thankyou for at least bringing some thing to fight us provi block was appreciated was a great fleet overall and i had a great birthday and a great stream :D  
---
and 3v1 thats cool i assumed as much you guys usually form similar ships when we come that way I wont let it deter us from being content that way again in the future dont worry :D  
---
Thanks again to the FC and everyone that joined my birthday fleet :D
---
We are talking about alliance level so init , goons , test, PH, FRT , Darkness , snuff and you are mostly fine.

It's to easy to work around it with bookmarks and warp at range. If they removed warp to 100 and bookmarks within say 100km of a stargate or station it would work.
---
But honestly gate camping is such stale content I really don't think it's worth buffing.
---
/u/ccp_falcon are they ready yet to know the truth ?
---
I upvote, I watch, and then Youtube tells me I can't upvote it again, bastards.
---
I feel dumb for training into dreks when iki is strictly better.
---
That would be the chinese way.
---
And you really think big alliances dont allready have spys everywhere? :)
---
Asherothi has public fleets regularly.
---
Really made all the paragraphs all pretty and shit and it just throws it together goddamit
---
Make friends with wh corp.
---
Join wh corp.
---
Your storages fill up with materials wayy too quickly.
---
Figure out that I am an 'elite pvper' (looses ships to rats) and pi is below me.
---
???
---
Profit!
---
&gt; aside from being pointless.
---
Aka the Bellicose, Falcon, Scorpion.
---
It's a 200iq play
---
Pls learn to undock ingame first, thx a lot.
---
I think a couple of times I've had core on the 1st step.
---
You wouldn't have thought Falcon was pointless if you were flying one about five years ago...
---
But, every year that same sentence can be applied to a new set of ships.
---
I found him doing a good 10/10 a week ago in one. Kept an arazu and a cloaked Loki off the ingate for an hour as he kept undocking and redocking from a fort. He warped a pod in then a prospect. The prospect went through to the first room and cloaked. Eventually he landed I decloaked went for tackle but he cyno’d out! Was gutted. Next time I’ll make sure to have a cloaky sabre there.
---
From what i gather progrod's been pretty burnt out and hasn't been playing much.
---
I would report him for insults. This is going way to far.
---
A long way since the serenity cartel days
---
Ah nice. D
---
I swear I saw someone suggest that either yesterday or the day before yesterday.
---
Lol u got us bro nice one

Sometimes you just sit back, relax, and enjoy the moments like [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KquFZYi6L0).

That sucks. Dude was a rage machine, but he generated content non-stop
---
I think it's pretty funny that all those dudes were bridged in for 1 ikit
---
What a cheap fit. Nothing worth crying over
---
No idea what happened in between me winning EVE in 2014 and say, a month ago, but since this bittervet returned to EVE a couple weeks ago I've been doing some fleets with SpectreFleet and having a lot of fun refamiliarizing myself with the game (and losing some spacepixels in spectacular fashion :D). Without Spectre's public fleets I probably would've done a handful of missions, gotten quickly bored, whelped some ships with dumbass mistakes and then left.
---
I can wholeheartedly recommend SpectreFleet for those who want to do some fun fleets. They have a wide variety of doctrines and fleet-timezones, competent FCs and a fun attitude with regards to dumb mistakes.
---
No reason to leave hisec atm, better and safer than null for isk making. Pls HTFU
---
they make better, more expensive kills in the end, so i am not complaining.
---
Zkill has a crapton of ESI auth collected. The software itself isn't really worth all that much on it's own.
---
quality shitpost. I lol'd
---
Ugh, please revert this change. It's very annoying to have to add all the kills manually.
---
Payouts are pretty good for high sec life, there are still risks though Trigs are some mean NPC's haha
---
I'd go for cynabal, you don't need that much tank for 3\\4.
---
Makes sense. Instant intel in form of map stats so you know where to go for hunting. Instant intel in form of killmails so you know if there any camps or fighting in there. And Blackout to make you invisible until you decide to actually attack.
---
As a person who sticks to high sec I would like one caveat. A path connecting all major trade hubs just be high sec.
---
The ability for security status to change is to say "everything is potentially low sec" meaning there would be no safe place to park your ship, run research, run production, or at least you could move these things yourself but I guess you could sit on the market.
---
its a decent counter against goons isnt it? :) they have whole region intel you couldnt go unnoticed
---
The faction we need.
---
Use https://zkillboard.com/ and check out ship losses to find fittings you like.
---
Haha! I remember hellcamp of 319- back in 2012. I was in Red Alliance. Undocked in my carrier to troll campers. And then... fleet invite! Never not accept! Accepted and watched. And then my carrier started to align to warp! Wrote “good one” into local and left the fleet 🤣
---
Well... Sorry, if you need to ask this, choose another game.
---
Tbh they ain't good fits if you die in them.
---
I don't get it, ESI never gave away killmails without somebody consenting to it first. If you're in a corp which automatically posts killmails then you're consenting by being in that corp in the first place. If said corp automatically posts lossmails as well then it's their own fault.
---
That's a ridiculous and incorrect assumption.  
---
People can lose ships for reasons other than their fit.
---
I mean in Eve people work hard for stuff and losing stuff can hurt enough that a person can turn to vulgarities. I don't encourage it but I feel it's understandable.
---
If understand if he was in high sec but when outside of that... Seriously don't fly what you can't afford to lose.
---
Autocannons and a dual tanking bonus
---
Botting exists regardless of complexity, yes CCP tries.
---
Plex won’t drop too low before stabilizing, ask your friendly neighborhood trillionaires when they plan to buy out everything on the market and follow that
---
i wonder how long would it take to print a full scale avatar, 462 years?
---
If you enjoy it yes if not no.
---
If you enjoy “building up economically” it’s becoming increasingly difficult to doso from “scratch” so if you enjoy the challenge go for it.

If not no

I knew my salvage fit passive regen leviathan was a brilliant idea
---
ITS NEVER DIED BEFORE ON ZKILL AFTER ALL
---
Have you seen the shit that gets said in eve?  this is surprisingly tame
---
I've been flying with a guy that I just now realized has only been playing 2-3 months. Granted he's probably bought a couple skill injectors. But so far we have
---
Had a blast in FW
---
Run many level 4s
---
Run incursions for 3 days (made over a billion easy) he was in the srp tdf fit vindi
---
Run 4 strongholds (FoBs) all researched and planned by him
---
Run exploration sites and hunted in wh space and in catch through Thera (route planned by him)
---
Probably other fun stuff I'm forgetting.
---
If you decide what you want to focus first and plan it, you can almost jump right in. Once you've got core skills up a bit, it's very easy to train in a new direction.
---
You don't have to be lvl5 skilled in everything to enjoy it. And if you find a good income, faction modules often out perform t2 and can help close the skill gap for often not too much more expense.
---
This is just what I know from seeing what fairly new and dedicated players have been doing lately.
---
Hope it helps
---
Anythin above 10 (assuming perfect customs skill) is pretty much shit.
---
Thank you for a real answer.
---
&gt; srp tdf fit vindi
---
i love eve language
---
I'm sorry that you fail to understand my question. Thanks for being inclusive! &gt;&gt;
---
Well... Sorry, if you need to comment this, choose another game.
---
You do realize balancig ships is a continuos process?
---
Yes, but yelling L2P and calling someone idiot is directly aiming for person, not for ingame character.
---
Maybe he should get punished to understand this game is not for him? It would be better for his mental health.
---
Yea its just a game,  except this dude xD
---
worst advice related to my question. Main reason being that need to manually lookup all the wormholes to even see if they are pulsars, and hope people that die in those pulsar wormhole actually has ship fittings related to pulsars....
---
There are better ways to make isk that arent afk. Ffs there is more to eve than letting your drones kill shit for you.
---
EVE is a pvp sandbox first and a space ship game second. So if you join for the PVP sandbox then easily yes, also because there aren't too many other games out there. If you join because of the space ships then possibly yes as long as you recognize that it's a PVP sandbox, doesn't do hand holding and requires brain effort.
---
They can't... They have never been able too.
---
And they had many little Thrashers! &lt;3
---
People rarely share their fits outside of zkill, most people make their own or use corp/alliance fits.
---
Thank you as well for the answer my guy! 
---
Got any tips for starting fresh? Any clans (corps I think is what they're called)
---
They'd be so easy to add, the bonuses already exist. Just need slot layouts and fitting, longest/hardest part would be the art team designing the model.
---
Well again if you have director spies to get alliance killmail apis good for you :)
---
Goons live for "Drama"
---
You make Concord killable, theb balance will need to occur for them to become OP, to kill you, then you open the option of Concord banning your clones from all stations that are Empire based.
---
What ?
---
soon
---
people are angry when you blob them, more new at 11
---
set safety green or yellow
---
Hasn't been that long 9 months maby lol
---
Oh no 100,000 ISK bounty. You better watch out
---
Imaginary internet points of course
---
Did i say ban? You can limit access to chat - "oh wait this is already being applied to everyone" so maybe just send him gm mail to behave? "yellow card".
---
Sometimes it helps and it would take day or two so he had enough time to steam out.
---
I'm recently returning to Eve and struggling to find a good home corp-wise. I'm a PvP focused player so I joined a corp which promised consistent PvP roams with experienced FC's, and the FC's had less of a clue than I did and it turned out to have more of a carebear focus. I have now joined another corp under Imperium Coallition, and was promised regular activity by the recruiter, and whilst at an alliance level there are big fleets, there has been on average 3 people online at all times at a corp level, no chatter, and even the discord is a wasteland. I've been in this one a couple days, am I being impatient? Cause I feel like a lot of recruiters promise things that aren't really the reality of the corp, I want a corp that actually plays the game lmao. I feel like im spending more time filling out applications and moving to corps staging system than actually playing the game with them. Can anyone help a lost dog.
---
The most important question is : why the f* did he had 753x 425mm railgun I?
---
If you wish to join, its not "too late".
---
However I recommend not joining the obvious "Brave newbies/Pandemic Horde/ Karma Fleet" who are advertized as newbrofriendly, which they are yes. 
---
The problem of said entities is that they effectively brainwash newer players into simplified pilots who follows orders and are esentially taught not to think for themselves.
---
This along with the abuse of them towards furthering their personal income via taxes &amp; the likes.
---
I recommend trying out HS for first couple days to see if you even care the slightest about the game, and if you do, join a small wormhole space group.
---
it only needs half of the partys involved to consent to the information being posted and yes i have giving my esi for both myself and my corp.
---
So you want to ban people from chat for raging at a loss?          
---
That's pretty petty.
---
Shield Nestor’s pls
---
new faction minmatar+caldari
---
lost my hauler in similar way on last sunday.
---
It is a dumb post and it's not opinion based or subjective. The day skill injectors were released, a filthy rich guy(RMT) made a new character and went from 0 to literally ALL the skillpoints in several hours.
---
Even if skill injectors didn't exist(we can only dream) it will take you few months to be competetive in almost any area of the game.
---
Hmm, smuggling isn't a thing?   
---
Well, you could go buy stuff from alliance A and sell it to alliance B for profits. That would usually be prohibited by the alliance. Sell Goon supers/titans to their enemies for example. 
---
Still you'd need a shit ton of experience to do so (in character and in person). Also the hefty amount of ISK to fund your wrong doing and start out. Also you obv need to gain trust with the people first. But you could make a profit out of it since large null blocs sell their assets fairly cheap.   
---
Pro tip: If you get there one day: Get people to buy fully fitted titans (bling them out) then when they buy them, kill em with a trap and get retrieve the items that drop. (Looking at you, Ivana Trading...)
---
And how is someone who hasn't played the game supposed to know this? Thanks for being an ass, but thanks for the information as well. At least it was 50/50
---
Thanks boss! Will do!
---
wealty botter
---
No one who plays this game in any kind of competant capacity wants kill mails to be delayed. If it needs to be explained to you, you are probably a thicko.
---
during the casino war spectre had over 1000 ppl in chat and had to form 2 fleets one or two times tnx to the fleet cap.
---
ofc picking a side (sweet sweet isk) in a war dident work out well for a npsi fleet and most of us died to ppl we had to set blue (cant tell all of pl,nc etc to blue every random pilot in spectre)
---
as a former spectre pilot i know its still a fun place for care free welps, its just have its up's and down's of bad fc's and command team like every npsi fleet
---
Afraid not
---
There is plenty to learn _from_ eve that has some real life relevance and use. Some basic concepts around economy, logistics, social structures, some aspects or war.  I think beyond that the game isn’t the healthiest or most sensible way to spend (or waste) your time.
---
I don't think you're being impatient, corps like that are common (although I would give them at least a week to make an informed decision). In fact, I've found it very rare to see corp-level activity in a nullsec alliance. Usually groups are based more on SIGs (special interest groups), so it doesn't matter which corp you're in at all.
---
Thanks, the Reddit community seems 50/50 when it comes to being decent/informative people. Thank you for the information.
---
And killed in 15 minutes with the first drunk pilot that touches it.
---
name one bad one?
---
Two posts less than 3 days old about The Mighty Beans. What’s the grudge?
---
Is there even such a thing? Iron Crown at this point is almost a caricature or a stereotype gone too far. I honestly think it would be in Frat's best interest to just purge them, maybe the publicity brownie points would grant them more supporters.
---
Been playing for about a month and I love flying my hecate.  Fast and hits hard.
---
Mining ship, bpcs, likely produced them for sale
---
Thanks. I am quite torn about recommending EVE or warning about it. I think I learned quite a lot from it and/or gave some helpful insights (though be careful to 1:1 translate that to the real world), but I really think that only goes so far. A lot or people tend to overstate EVE’s complexity. It isn’t so deep, rather it’s broad: it’s more that there is a lot of aspects / mechanics that exist on parallel.
---
The reason I still lurk around here is that there is some emotional investment and habits. Which goes to show some of the strengths  of the game but perhaps also why you might want to stay away from it or at least not get overly invested and move when the time’s there
---
It probably has a lot of empty volume inside (bays, bunks, storage, hallways). I think you can cut that volume by 90%. Still, that leaves about 325m years of printing time.
---
This print job is about 40 hours on my desk machine.
---
I am also relative new. Starting now is a uphill battle against many who know the game better, have better skills and cash. Knowing someone irl who can act as a mentor surely will help though.
---

---
Understandable, you've put too much into the game to quit? Whether it be time, money, or even just lifestyle.
---
I'm kinda kicking myself for quitting 4 years ago. I'm a pretty avid gamer, I specifically wanted to ask the community on this one because it seems almost "exclusive" and "unreachable" in terms of progression. At least contextually.
---
Thanks, I'll see if I have any long lost friends who could assist. Best of luck to you!
---
There are websites which list pulsar wormholes. It wouldn’t take long to trawl zkill for losses in them
---
time laps video please
---
Why make pvp less consequential? It’s great that people are scared to lose their pod, makes us smartbomb in blingier and blingier fits, which then draws its own hunters to us, hoping to get a juicy killmail.
---
If you just want to fight without it having any consequences go join one of those sisi “pvp” outfits.
---
having a hard time reading through, but congratz on the move op.
---
Opened doc. First thing is about a leviathan not being able to kill 100 bombers. 
---
Is this a troll post?
---
IMO drones should be moved over to a system close to that of fighters
---
Eh. It’s more of a thought than an actual proposal that I would put effort into.
---
Frat and Tri did this to us in the past.  Same medicine doesn't seem to taste good.
---
Assfuckers OR assholes, make up your mind
---
I smell racism against our chinese brothers in arms.
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
Lets keep some kind of culture. How does it look if CCP allows behaviour like this?
---
Gigx was perma banned for raging on lost alliance, same thing but on smaller scale
---
CCP should finish the fucking module tiericide
---
In fact, zkillboard is open source, so you can run your own instance and remove/modify the delay: https://killboard.winterco.org/
---
A cheap 600M Cerb can run T4 Darks easily. Take one of those 3B fits, debling it except keep a faction web, and viola.
---
uhhhhhhhh beettani?
---
It looks perfectly fine. People raging is literally meaningless. GigX wasn't banned for "raging", he was banned for threatening to cut a guy's hands off, and his ban was ridiculous because he recanted and apologised before the ban.        
---
You don't want "some kind" of culture, you want *your kind* of culture, where no-one is allowed to say anything negative. And that culture is absolutely terrible.
---
try not getting scrammed,my retri sure has a mwd. and so does my hawk
---
Isnt that a DST?
---
Do you have a fit on hand? And have you got any tips for me running the sites? I'm assuming you've done these before.
---
I am talking about only learning implants.      
---
So if someone want to fly in a snake/slave pod - why not.     
---
Hardwirings are also a thing that will not be affected.           
---
Currently we are saying to newbies - pay 40-100mil in +4 learning implants to skill much faster ... and then we tell them - take a 1mil frigate/destroyer and have 'cheap' fun in PVP.            
---
For them this 8h less training time means that they will be able to use/fly something before weekend.        
---
So they will not go and have fun in cheap pvp.
---
So much this. CCP, once again, with their blinkers on ignoring the massive issues for stupid fixes.
---
More or less yes, but DST don't have jump drive.     
---
Instead of introducing a new line of jump capable subcapital hauling ships, we can dress up a DST into a battleship hull, and let it **fall under all mechanics and limitations** a black ops battleships are defined by.
---
Just a poisonous bunch of leadership that don't belong in wh space.
---
Hello all, 
---
I seem to have seen a link to a corp recruitment website (like a general board where corps where advertising). Can anyone direct me to that link (saw it in a reddit comment some while back but cant find it anymore).
---
(Am looking to join a null-sec corp for exploration/ratting and the occassional PvP :) )
---
I mean it's more specific and factual to use autists instead of retards, so I'll amend my statement.
---
Autists need sarcasm pointed out, as in they can't understand it and take statements literally.
---
You can invest but note that your goal would need to change according to how CCP chooses to change things... So yeah, try it on...
---
Instant killmails helps almost all groups, it lets you know when there's a fleet out and about and it gives you a good idea if pvpers are active in an area, so it'll make it easier to find content at all sizes.
---
The only people it really helps are gatecampers.
---
I'd go with that. Because DST has pretty much everything you need with a nice 50K hanger.   Be very good option for the smaller guys to haul stuff through null.
---
+1 from me

I think he only meant that a JF could jump to covert cynos and nothing about a cloak.

***My response***
---
&gt;I'll have to respectfully disagree with every single point you've made in these three paragraphs.
---
That's the great thing here, we can disagree, however, in my capacity, it is unlikely I will have any effect on Eve, in yours, its possible it will do.
---
&gt;Feel free to dredge up T20 - I was on the other side of the fence as an angry player when that happened. Completely different company now, completely different people. Your point is entirely moot. Correct, it was a shitshow, and it was dealt with when it happened way back in the day. You screw around like that at CCP these days, you're out of the door. It's as simple as that. I get accused of being biased on a daily basis, and of being a cheater. One day I'm being accused of being biased toward PL, the next day it's GSF. Life goes on.
---
I did not point at a single block, I pointed at a game-play-style. Feel free to try and conflate the two, however, it would be disingenuous to do so.
---
&gt;On your point about soundbytes - news flash - anyone who knows me knows that I don't pander. If I have something to say, I say it. I don't give a shit what "demographic" it plays well with - if I have an opinion on the game as a 17 year veteran of it, I'll be sure to express it, both externally to the community, and internally at CCP. Admittedly that's caused friction internally too at times - even recently when I've been vocal about my views, but that's what makes CCP great - we're encouraged to talk about our products and what we like and dislike about them. Sue me for having an opinion and wanting something that I think is for the betterment of the game. I don't pander - everyone is equal in my eyes and I don't care for politics.
---
I wish I could trust those words, I do not know you personally, so I cannot weigh your words with your actions, however, given the type of job you do, and my interaction with numerous CMs over the years, I will take what you say with a pinch of salt. You are doing a job, that job holds you to certain standards, although it seems that those standards are somewhat slipping, and this is not a personal attack here, so please hear me out, and this is further backed up by your comments on reddit and your further points in the above post.
---
&gt;My job as a community manager is to communicate, correct, but it's not to stand by and watch us sit on our balls if I can help prevent that by giving solid feedback from our players. That's my job. Whether that feedback is listened to is at the behest of people above my pay grade, but I make sure that voices are heard - that's what I do. That's what all community managers do. We're the front line support for dealing with player sentiment, **regardless of whether we agree with it or not**.
---
Your job as a community manager is to represent all voices within eve, whether you agree with them or not. Voicing your personal preference not only waters down that representation, it brings it into question as to how well you can represent those you simply don't agree with. We all think we are able to walk the line, hold truth to power, make sure we uphold the views of others even if we disagree with them, but we cant. It's one of the fundamental flaws of human beings. We are complex, innately selfish and self-serving. You may believe you represent the views of a huge swathe of people in eve, but I can guarantee without ever meeting you that you probably represent the views you agree with more, and with more vehemence and desire. This isn't even something any of us need to question, it is simply how we work. Which is why I have an issue with you placing your view in public light because not only does it give other players a green light to attack those of an opposite view, it basically makes them assume its ok for them to do so, because they are "right", when in reality, they are not, it's simply a view. Look at the hate, vitriol, cancel your account and so on responses to this thread, simply for airing an opinion. It's disgusting to say the least.
---
&gt;On your point about a bitter and twisted rage fest, one of the best quotes I've ever heard from a player was printed in the "Into the second decade" book that we published on the 10th anniversary. It read "Mark my words, this game will be dead in six months.".
---
These two things are not compatible, see above for my points regarding twisted rage fests, it was not with regards to the game dying, but the game becoming far more vitriolic, poisonous and hate filled, which lays at your feet for emboldening people who think they are "elite pvpers" with the idea you are on their side and what they are doing is ok. It's not.
---
&gt;That was a quote from 2003, yet here we are. EVE has been "dying" and "declining" since it was conceived in the eyes of everyone who doesn't like the changes that are made to it. People come and go, opinions change, but the people who stick around are those core pillars of our community who realise what the objective is for New Eden.
---
The year on year trend within eve is with less players. I don't want eve to die, I want massive battles with insane numbers and territorial wars happening all across new eden, I want to see the massive fights that make news headlines and other MMO players look at the game in awe, you simply advocate a band-aid that is stuck on a bruise, as opposed to the gaping wound that is pissing out blood. (The band aid is the blackout).
---
&gt;Sorry mate, but the three step approach of trying to shame me about history - which was set right years ago, trying to tell me how to do my job, then trying to shame the community because they're excited and debating changes that are happening to the game doesn't fly with me.
---
There is no approach in trying to shame you, nor the community. If you think excited debate is what has happened in this thread, or others, then I despair at what you think hateful comments are. Eve has become far more toxic than I have seen since I started playing, you have engendered the play-style vs play-style toxicity with airing your own views enabling people to become even more toxic because they think they are on the right side of a debate, with a CCP employee. I would caution your future words in this regard, and also ask that you reflect on your ability to draw on play-styles you may not agree with. All play-styles make eve go around, apart from bots of course, but every player has a place in eve, whether that is PvE or PvP. I don't expect eve to be fair, forgiving or easy, however, I expect an employee of CCP to be all of the above and take into account that their preferences are not the same as what the community wants or needs. Most of the community would turn this game into a shit-fest within a matter of weeks if they had control of it.
---
Essentially, the blackout does not fix anything, nothing at all, it has simply given players excitement because eve, of late, has been boring as shit. That is the players fault, but also CCPs. Creating chaos, turning the game upside down is not going to fix any of the above, it will simply push new players away and annoy cemented players already enjoying the game, in addition, forcing those players to join the umbrellas and thus, create more stagnation. CCP needs to focus on the core aspect that is causing stagnation, capitals, cyno mechanics, sov mechanics, the point of owning space. Putting fluff into the game won't fix any of these, removing local won't fix any of these.
---
I make this post with the utmost respect, I hope it is received as such.
---
\---
---
Suffice to say, I don't agree with the way the delay has been implemented, its poorly implemented, giving hunters a huge swathe of intel yet giving those they hunt hardly any, since not many people in their right mind monitor their intel channels, its very easy to go to a system where people NPC hunt and log off for 30min, log back on and cloak, easy kills. It's utterly ridiculous right now.
---
Bruh... Just teach newbies to switch to a blank clone. All it takes is infomorph lvl 1 and a citadel with a clone bay to dump your learning clone for the roam.
---
Serious question, how does this blackout help eve? What is bad about others knowing you just died?
---
and
---
No, there's something supremely ironic about a guy whining about a guy who lives in an NPC nullsec station whining about asset safety.
---
If he can protect his shit, why can't you?
---
Do you have any evidence or is this all word of mouth?
---
kk, ya think it can do sleepers?
---
Name checks out. 🤣
---
Pretty much the attitude of 99% of the game's players, including yours.
---
Would you agree to assets (or a small percentage of them) being subjected to loot drop mechanics? Would you be cool if any given item in your inventory had a 15% chance of dropping or being destroyed with your keep? Or would you be offended by the suggestion that you could lose assets if your strux die?
---
If you're in nullsec you have no idea if you're surrounded by 100 bombers or not. Totally spoopy.
---
Yes but someone doesnt understand if you play a game, the company dictates rules.
---
are we gonna go down the rabbit hole of things that are abusive because it doesn't look great down there for tapi tbh
---
I dont think they should ban you from stations.
---
&gt;They cant clear dictors well on an astra when they can be tethered, bubble and dock
---
can we talk about how this is kind of a stupid mechanic
---
covert jfs sound like a really fucking stupid idea imo
---
Beyond fucking stupid.
---
He lost a widow to a bunch of supers? Shameful.
---
A long time ago ppl build modules to compress minerals.      
---
Maybe he rather lost a large chunk after reprocessing (which worked differently back then) than everything... ironic.
---
&gt; Suppose this is true (but it isn't). 
---
It's only not true in the present tense. It would be true if all of your ideas were implemented. As I said, you might as well demand caps be deleted.
---
Oh, and it actually is partly true. Even now, most hunter fleets can disengage in relative safety of a harpy fleet shows up. Most hunters aren't any more interested in a fight than the guys they hunt. Neither if them want actual risk, just easy isk or easy ganks. Your proposals address only one side of this.
---
I want risk. I hate asset safety and the panic mods but at the same time, the risk needs to go both directions, which you do not appear to be interested in.
---
&gt;Capitals are now as common as T3Cs now, or more. They should be treated as such. That's all my proposals do.
---
Did you add injectors to your doc, yet? If not, then you haven't begun to address why caps are so common today.
---
Funny you should mention that, because the word of mouth thing is exactly how they distribute their poison. They are masters at twisting facts to suit their goals and spreading lies when it suits them. 
---
If you want evidence, it isn't hard to gather. Zkill doesn't lie. Oh that's another thing they do, shoot their fellow corpmates in a fight to distort the zkill points in their favour, just take a look. Unless of course you already knew this!
---
2 adjustments to make it economically correct:
---
\- The economy has an inflation period (for the last several years), not a deflation. The with lowering demands of goods, and more isk in the economy of eve, the value of isk decreases. That is called inflation. Deflation would be, if isk would become worth more, than they used to (this is maybe what will happen now)
---
\- Roqing (or mining in total) has no effect as isk sink/faucet. It does not generate or sink ADDITIONAL isk. It generates "only" minerals. Then when the minerals are sold, the isk is transfered from A to B, but the total amount stays the same. (It does cause mild deflation though, as more minerals can be bought with less isk)
---
You don't need them. Let's say you have a spy in TEST and Vily goes ahead with getting his minions to set up a Legacy killboard. All you have to do is use your TEST spy to scrape the Legacy killboard and send all of the mails back to your own killboard. There are ways to mitigate this but ultimately in a big bloc alliance where getting spies in is easy, you won't be able to maintain secrecy of mails published to an internal killboard.
---
mental gymnastics from Shak again, you forget we know your ingame character you cringey little faggot hahahaha
---
On zkill what period is recent?
---
'Too much text had to crop', writes several paragraphs of your own side. Not biased at all mate. 
---
To long didnt read.
---
I thought supers couldn’t dock in NPC stations ?
---
The cheaper the bomber, the easier the decision to attack
---
You cannot perfectly balance asymmetrical pvp. But good thing is that you do not really need to.
---
But what you're missing is people connecting their esi to your service. So, not really.
---
But engage is a rather neutral term already.
---
You're so wrong, drek is the best Trig ship by far, the hac takes WAY too long to spool up
---
Already replaced
---
You picked the wrong time to get into trading.
---
With maxed out skills, you're effectively paying 9.25% on each trade in fees and taxes.
---
Why should they not. You committed a crime against the police therefore any station with food standing with Concord should shut you out. You want things to be realistic then you have to show how powerful the Concord and the Empire is and how easy it is for them to basically shit on you. And if anything you want it more realistic, Concord and Empires should be able to make offensive moves to purge Alliances that become a nuisance to them or push their hands to far out.
---
Just no auto aggro seems an easy enough fix.
---
That won't bother bot though.
---
Why JF with coverts op cloack will be broken?             
---
* you can warp cloacked - so you are harder to catch and kill in lowsec/higsec ^(for example look how many JF are dying on gates both on lowsec and higsec side - ability to cloack and warp is huge change)                          
---
* **one of the most significant change** you can now deploy a L sized structure from a cover op ship. **Like you can Jump in to covert cyno a JF, warp it cloacked to spot on enemy keepstar, deploy fort , and cloack**                
---
Like to drop a fortizar you cannot use something smaller than orca, most often thing used is a rorqual - and you see it coming in to system (normal cyno) also you can see him warping.
---
 &gt; Suggestion based on Falcons incredibly naive vision of EVE.
---
AKA the majority of EVE player complaints to CCP
---
That's a big hassle if they so much as keep the IDs and hashes on the back end so that you're forced to scrape the raw data.
---
Like it will allow you to deploy fortizar from a covert ops ships, if this is limited to 50k ... you cannot  simply put fortizar inside.
---
I prefer to have this BO hauler than a covert ops JF.
---
How about neither!
---
Being able to deploy a structure like that is not IMO a serious enough reason to ignore a change which could drastically shift the need for smaller groups to be part of large coalitions in order to perform even basic supply duties. 
---
If you're really that desperate about dropping a fortizar on a hostile grid, why wouldn't you just titan bridge a suicide freighter through.
---
Yep, you can even sell your character on the character bazaar if you wish! Most people will end up extracting all of your skills to sell as skill injectors, but you can do it!
---
Reddit decided I needed to change my password so I copy and paste it but unfortunately it jumbled it all together
---
Lol they’re like vampires
---
Starting any game not on release day will leave you struggling to catch up against players who know the game better. I suggest that anyone can catch up in Eve even forsaking the drug called skill injectors. Join a group that is willing to help you learn and you can't really go wrong. Log back into your old character and leave it as Alpha to get a feel of how things are and if you like it, then consider omega status.
---
Thanks dude, I appreciate the info
---
EvE iS dYiNg!
---
I want to go where the pvp is now, not where it was 2 hours ago. Who would have guessed?
---
https://www.eveworkbench.com/
---
I want a trig carrier with trig fighters.
---
Imagine fighters with damage that ramps up over time.
---
i think it's a bit different when we are talking about a drop fleet like this one compared to a few titans, supers and faxes.
---
Like 15 caracals would be able to fight this fleet, maybe not win, but fight it. 
---
Now consider the outcome if those 15 caracals were against a same numbered super fleet. 
---
Not that it really matters. Umbrellas aren't cheating or anything like that. I get why those that can use one, do it.
---
&gt;Being able to kill high value targets ~~which literally can't fight back is never going to~~ that have high strategic value hold**s** ~~any manner of~~ **high** importance ~~with me so far as~~ **from** balancing ~~goes.~~ perspective.                 
---
Fixed for you.         
---
Ability to kill or limit someones logistics was a deciding factor in many conflicts.              
---
JF hauling from null to jita 4-4 is already to safe, lets not make it even bigger issue.
---
no you're retarded
---
50k m3 of cargo is actually quite a lot.        
---
Assuming that this will cost around 1-1.5b per hull it is reasonable trade of for not totally broken ship.
---
If it was biased, I would have not included the link to his post. You think I should have posted his reply then not replied to it? What kind of fruit-loop thinking is that?
---
Killing freighters is about denying your opponent the ability to fight in the first place. Without ever having to engage them on the field of battle.
---
Perfectly logical IRL. A mainstay of military tactics for thousands of years.
---
Not great for a game that provides content based on engaging your opponent in battle.
---
Add some up bonuses to logi drones too.
---
did this kill firetail btw it seems it now has issues process kills that where posted by a api or esi key
---
You actually don't need tank at all. I often run 5/10s and 6/10s with a buffer fit cerb.
---
Use your MWD to pull range.  Rats have an auto orbit range, if you exceed that, they will just approach you.  Also, rats have optimal and falloff range just like us.  At extended range they won't be able to damage you.
---
Find a high DPS ship with a buffer shield fit, MWD, and good range.  An Arty cynabal will work fine.  Since the cynabal goes so fast you might even be able to fit an AB and still outrun the rats. Again, burn directly away from them, especially the frigates.  You will get zero transversal and pop them in one shot.
---
As for fitting, any kyte pvp fit should be fine, just swap the point for a sensor booster. You will want the lock range.
---
What is better is a cerb though.  81km range with rapid lights (apply really well against frigs) and 700 DPS. About 450 with the reload.
---
While I'm not overly fond of CODE I fail to see why anyone downvoted that comment. He's right, it is pretty classy to post your own demise and it's a computer game so... um... it is all for the laughs (or should be). Have an upvote for your troubles.
---
For more fog of war.
---
Delay some ESI endpoints by 2 hours.
---
Faction modules are T1 so why should ships be any different?
---
Finally?? They die all the time.
---
The whiteout in Jita balances the blackout in null.
---
Do the HAMs not apply like shit to the frigs? Or does the web help with that?
---
Is it this website?
---
https://eve-corps.com/
---
There's also r/evejobs
---
Web and faction HAMs work great. You just do so mich raw damage that they drop in a few volleys.
---
Blackout only hides local... it doesn't prevent chat spam.
---
This is the content I'm looking for after getting dunked by a gate camper screaming "GeT gUd ScRuB"
---
So it can't read the probe scanner to ping you when the ice belt depletes? There's a bot that can do this, I just can't find it anywhere. At least, that's how I assume it knows
---
Not necessarily, making a bot is hard, but downloading and using one can be done by a monkey.  Esp if your alliance supports it, they probably have botting-for-dummy guides.
---
People gather info of where are you, ir where are fight happening, reading insta-killmails.
---
If you know how, you can get a los of info from that mails.
---
It's a way of broadcasting the same input to multiple clients at the same time. For example, pressing F1 on all of your multiboxed accounts to shoot at the same time.
---
It is against the eula and you will get banned for doing it.
---
Cynabal should be good. Vagabond is also good with slightly more tank and much more dps dps. But you don't really need the extra tank in high sec sites except in few escalations and in Serpentis Vigil.  
---
AC is definitely better than artillery. You will be shooting frigates. Keep at range 15-20 km and wreck the frigates as they try to approach/fly away. Split the turrets to two groups to kill two of the weaker frigs per cycle. 
---
You don't need scanning rigs if you have decent scanning skills and sister probes.
---
I dunno, if you're dumb enough to get warped to 0 on an enemy citadel, you should not have an easy time getting out.
---
It's the prey's fault for not spotting the predator before it got chewed up.
---
IIRC eve does have a block button... it makes local a lot nicer
---
Am autistic, can not confirm
---
They can just write in some new lore reason about how SoE developed a carrier or FAX for long-term W-Space operations. Plus with how dangerous everything is getting in EVE, couldn't hurt to have some kind of fancy cap ship.
---
Want my faction destroyers.... but then again just like the Kikimora all I gotta do is bring like 20-30 corms and laugh at you.
---
I was promoted to Ops after FCing for 4 months. I started playing in Feb of 2018, FCing in April of 2018, and got promoted in August.
---
I left quietly, started my own thing (with intent to fill the corp from spectre fleets I ran). Not sure how not telling anyone I was leaving equated to expecting some exodus. I joined The Ancients. for 11 days and then joined NC.
---
My Provi campaign fleets didn't get numbers (something I was faulted with because I didn't FC enough) so I opted to not continue. I had no drive to do it anyway and made a mistake trying to get myself immediately back involved in nullsec warfare without a strong alternative (like I have now).

Please, if you're going to tell a story, tell the right one.

blackout wouldn't help you. What you need to do is turn away from jita local.
---
Not that CCP cleaning up all the bots spamming in jita local wouldn't be nice, but they sure haven't for the past 8+ years so i'm not sure i'd expect them to start now.
---
Use a few bombers (don't need that many) with void bombs to suck their cap dry then jump them with a dictor and anything kitey/that can shoot at a distance.
---
Alternatively, just get an Arty ship that can shoot from far away and start shooting them. They'll probably escape and you won't kill them, but it'll eventually break the gatecamp.
---
Bonus points if you add an anti-tackle ship to your arty ship in case they are smart enough to have a few interceptors to warp their smart bombing ships to your arty ship
---
I've seen that before. It says you have to manually enter the command telling you it has depleted. I could set a timer on my phone if I see ít go away. I want it to tell me, not the other way around
---
I would assume you took out one of the pods too, just in case the botters were silly enough to put implants in them?
---
Alright, let's clear this:
---
caps / supers / rorqs who die ratting / mining = no alliance SRP
---
caps / supers / rorqs who die in ops = alliance SRP
---
thus, we conclude, if you were not in an op and died, it is your fault and not anyone else. Thus, you, as an individual, pay from your pocket to replace the losses. Thus, your loss, is of no importance to the alliance for anything else than making the economy flourish
---
I used to use a cynabal, but could also run them in a scythe fleet issue with an almost identical fit as a cheaper alternative but not as much deeps.
---
LOL 
---
Just goes to show - you mattered so little that everything I knew about you was from second-hand conversations by people laughing about it. Enjoy irrelevancy.
---
Cloaked JF -70% cargo hold problem solved.
---
Would be better if they reduce fuel usage for JF.
---
In retrospect, I think the major flaw in the SF Provi campaign was that the people leading it seemed to expect no change in Provi tactics following the "war declaration". - Before that, we generally tried not to blob Spectre when they came around. (Sometimes with limited success lol)
---
However once a public "war declaration" was issued, with a promise of sov and structure cancer thrown into the mix, we obviously stopped treating SF as a casual roaming type thing. We responded as we would any other invader trying to hit our stuff: by beating the shit out of them as decisively as possible. Their choices of doctrines, tactics, and local/reddit sperge seemed to indicate they were still expecting us to be holding back.
---
They also didn't seem to realized that null-sec "wars" include things like espionage and sabotage, which NPSI groups like Spectre are spectacularly vulnerable to. Which ended a couple of their fleets in rather hilarious fashions, one of which literally resulted in us flying away in the abandoned Monitor of the Spectre FC.
---
But yea. TLDR: It was just a poorly thought out concept from the start.
---
NP man. GL with it all.
---
Right O, got that sorted. Any order to target these things in.
---
If it pulls from zkill won’t it be delayed by 2 hours anyway? Regardless I hope ccp delay the esi killboard data by two hours. 
---
Free intel sucks.
---
I don't think there's a way to do this without manually reporting it, since I've belts need player interaction to start the 4 hour timer, there is definitely no API hook for it for a bit to look for. I'd guess that you just assumed the bot was automated, but it was just getting commands from the ice miners as they depleted.
---
waffles are pretty nice dudes
---
You posted a link, mostnwont even read your some dozen paragraphs of complaining let alone the link to read more nonsense. Anyways you only detailed your side without detailing theirs only simply positing a link.
---
But the part that got me was the /too much text had to crop/ part inb4 your absolute wall. Anyways idrc and at this point I have no play in this. Toodles.
---
It might
---
I have mostly quit. I cancelled 2 of my 3 paid subscriptions. If I am around I can join fleets still as I receive pings. I mostly stick to significant stratops / cta. For most intents and purposes I have quit the game, but I keep track of what’s happening.
---
Almost anything can be achieved in EVE, even if you start now. You can eventually get a titan, even two (not that that is the be all and end all in EVE). Again: Even if you start now.it’s not complicated, just repeating a basic task that generates income. The question always is: are you willing to throw so much time, money and effort into it. N

In the past year, I've seen: Muninns, Eagles, Feroxes, Machs, Nightmares, boosh Ravens, boosh Rokhs, normal Ravens sitting on a FAX, normal Rokhs sitting on a FAX, Abaddons (arty and laser), beam Legions, arty Lokis, Leshaks, Drekavacs, and of course the Stuka/Kiki/snatchfleet family of booshing small ships. 
---
All in kspace fleet combat, all used by fairly credible PvP organizations. There are a couple other fleet concepts that didn't make the cut, mostly because I'm pretty sure gigX's wife/cousin/uncle/stepdaughter all got banned slightly more than a year ago, so Zealots don't count.
---
it's literally just hobojamming 2.0 tho
---
I've depleted the belt being the only corporation member online, and within seconds, it pings Discord. It works off the probe scanner or something and is definitely automated. There were only 2 admin allowed to touch it, and it worked even with them offline. One of them was an IT guy. Maybe he created it?
---
Thanks man, much appreciated.
---
&gt;do you remember how game changed when people no longer had to upgrade clones each time they died?
---
Yes, suddenly death podding became the preferred mode of transport. Which is sickening tbh.
---
See below for quick, fast answer.
---
But I think a more valuable experience for you would be to fit both ships up in PYFA.  Download this out of game app and place it on your computer.  There, you can run the numbers and ask questions like: with all my strats neuts on the prot, how long will his cap hold? Will my tank hold for longer? Will my tank just barely hold but be enough with my EHP left over? Can I hold him at 9000m with scram/web/AB so that his blasters are barely applying? Will his tank eventually break but also give him &gt;3min to call for help?
---
Have you heard of our lord and saviour, unlimited, instant clone swapping in citadels.
---
Not really it's just a DST with a jump drive
---
How about you also tell them you can instant swap clone in a citadel with no cooldown.
---
TLDR: Don't put a stranger to your community in control of running a war. If you do, at least make sure said stranger isn't a complete tool who gives up after being awoxed (in a public fleet) after making rookie mistakes (not aligning in his own fleet, leaving free move on).
---
I disagree with a lot of what SF's done in the last half year, but I'm not the only one in SF's high command, so I just do what I can to keep it from becoming a complete clusterfuck. All I care about is that our day to day fleets keep going smooth and strong, and they luckily still do.
---
Glad to hear. It's really what we try to do with SF, or at least how I try to keep it: Solid daily content that anyone can join and just have a good time blowing shit up with.
---
you didnt really think this through.. did you?
---
In Eve all insults and threats are a part or role play. No real insults here its just a play.
---
&gt;and remove orcas from high
---
What did orcas ever do to get you so angry at them?

I prefer the gank version tho

Learning implants should go away. Imps should be for the other advantages they provide.
---
What I would like to see is a replacement for learning implants and also injectors.
---
The current Omega training formula is:
---
Primary_Attribute + 0.50 × Secondary_Attribute
---
Which means if you have a primary of 20 and a secondary of 20, you train at a rate of 1800SP per hour.
---
If you get rid of injectors with a 30 day booster that multiplies your attributes by 2X (100 PLEX), 5X (500 PLEX), or 10X (1000 PLEX), you can turn most any skill that doesn't involve capitals into a 7 (or less) day train to level 5, if you are willing to spend the isk. You still get the "catch up" of injectors but not something as OP as spend money -&gt;  push button -&gt; cap ready pilot.
---
People would want these drugs, available only via the NES for plex but salable on the market. It greatly enhances training and should still drive revenue for CCP but it will end the era of SP farms and Insta-Cap pilots.
---
u r dum
---
Yeah nobody has ever died in a quality fit...
---
Dude, you're either high or stupid. Eve and it's development is not a democracy. CSM is what it says, a Council. It has no say it what happens but are there as a tool for CCP to get recommendation from their players. CCP can ignore CSM as much as they want.
---
Even your example of skillsbooks is ignorant. Skillbooks are still a thing. You can buy some of them directly in space but for a markup (I'm not sure how high the markup is but I think it's 25%). If you want them cheaper you can still buy them as usual through the market. The skills you can buy directly are only the easier obtained ones however. Skillbooks that were hard to find still requires you to find them in the market.
---
When I see 50 of them in a single highsec ice belt being piloted by 1 guy. It has hp that put it between bs and cap lvl so it should be considered a cap and thus banned from high. On the ice belt note let's remove them from high as well
---
In case you didn't know, CCP announced they are adding a fit feature at some point, so there will be an ingame repository of fits.
---
Sorry if this is a dumb question but why not simply use a jump clone to swap implants if people are worried about losing their learning implants? It's not like there is any lack of public Citadels all over the place to switch clones and it doesn't even have a cooldown attached... Sure, you need a skill to use Jump Clones but the training required is not prohibitive (even for new players/characters). 
---
That obviously doesn't exclude the possibility of the boosters you suggest but it's not like there isn't already a readily available solution to swap implants....
---
And multiboxed rorqs.
---
Erm no, that's a terrible idea. ESI provides a lot of functionality that shouldn't be done away with. Big part of eve even existing nowadays is ESI allowing developing tools to work around serious flaws in CCP's design and UI. Industry, getting market prices reliably, etc. is basically impossible in eve without external tools.
---
Of course, that doesn't matter if you're just an F1 monkey in a big alliance that has everything set up for you instead, but it'd still break down if ESI (and thus all the tools) get axed since the ones doing it for you also still rely on it. Solo/small group players would be even more harmed.
---
Just because you don't like "free intel" from killmails doesn't mean you have any valid reason to delete all of ESI. Being able to see where things i own are because CCP's ingame search can't find it isn't exactly game breaking, for example.
---
Give the orca this role, it's a capital takes capital parts to build just doesn't need capital skill book..
---
All it needs is a jump drive and ability to covert cyno. This would see them used more in null and lowsec and would have zero impact on how their used in higher.
---
RIP Steve
---
More people need to see this, have an upvote
---
1.) Dock at any of the 5000 citadels within 1 jump of Jita
---
2.) Create an empty jump clone at the citadel
---
3.) ???
---
4.) Profit.
---
That's long enough
---
Many people like to hide in numbers so they don't have to perform, some people don't. Some want to find out stuff on their own, some want to have lots of interaction and explaining/tutoring. What works for one may make another player quit in disgust.  So any suggestion generally isn't really going to be about what might be good for you, but what the person who answered liked.
---
No need to rush and join a corp asap, especially not random spam invite corps. If they're not interested in you as an individual (player) it's probably not really about you but about using or taking advantage of you. Take your time to find a play style that sounds interesting, If you find something that entices you to log in, play and learn THEN go try and find a corp that supports that and has the size and intensity level that suits you.
---
If you tried your best and can't come up with a play style you enjoy, or you found one but turns out to be boring OR you think you'd like one but it requires other people a lot, then just join one of the more "generic" groups like EVE Uni.  Of all the "newbie friendly groups" they are the more genuine in their approach and goals.

I'm a new player, or will be soon, and I'm trying to figure out if I should download it through Steam so I can have access to all stores if I keep playing, or if I should use the client through my buddies refer a friend code.
---
I can't seem to find anything recently that says why not to use Steam, besides people just saying to not use Steam. Is there a reason to not use it or was that an old issue where it was kinda buggy for a while?
---
So basically a DST puddle jumper? I kinda like. 
---
Give it a fleet hold of 80K base and A 5% bonus to hold per level (maxed out at 100K), one highslot for the cloak and a jumpdrive.
---
There should be a cooldown post jump before the cloak can be activated, though.
---
Thanks, I'll keep this in mind too, it all seems to align with the other real answers here too.

But kill mails

I love how in synch the titans porting in was to the music

So why is it good for the game to have it delayed for two hours? I  understand that it is a lot of information but how is eve better for that information being two hours late?
---
Its current year so when someone comes up with something we just implement it straight away no questions asked.
---
Run a few T3s to get the hang of it but clear neuts off first, then webs, then ewar then dmg.
---
and this is exactly what I was lookin for! thanks

---
No! I say on every other new ship post and I'll continue to say it. Fix the ships we have before you make more. The meta is stale and needs more variety. Balance what we have and then you can have new ships.
---
I think something like a bowhead plus it could also have a clone bay would be really cool. 
---
It would certainly lend itself to the lack of null sec Npc coverage
---
&gt; Like it will allow you to deploy fortizar from a covert ops ships, if this is limited to 50k ... you cannot simply put fortizar inside.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; BO also cannot warp cloacked. 
---
Yopu could still give it total space of over 50K give it the 50K for fleet hangar and a good sized standard cargo. You get the m3 without having a fort deployer.
---
If there's going to be a delay it should be done properly - delay all of it, NPC kills, PVP kills, manually submitted ones etc and yes, do it at the ESI level.  Why should a player know within a few minutes that 200 PVP explosions happened on the other side of New Eden without any  effort to gain that information at all?  If Hilmar is to be believed regarding this Chaos Era theory,  let's get CCP to step up and delay all kills from the ESI.   Then we can  play and see how it works out and give an opinion.
---
F
---
Euni is still good to get an idea of what the ship is supposed to be generally like, then rework the fit to not be ass
---
Anti-Concord boats? Make them cov-ops like the Concord ships? I could get behind that but I want more balance to what we already have first
---
you can engage the enemy, your girlfriend, your brakes, a weapon safety, engines...yea pretty neutral word.
---
Cause. If i'm roaming with a few guys. Another guy can see  in that mail how many are we, what are we flying, etc. That can screw someone fleet.
---
Or, if i'm the most carebear miner. I see killmails near of where i'm, so i dock my ships. Etc.
---
If it's delayed, can be a roaming fleet next system where i'm and i don't know until they drop on grid. 
---
Info gathered by your mates, it's OK. But nobody should be able to act based on external apps intel.
---
Hey my falcon is the best cyno boat i know!
---
Isn’t your role to make sure the citadels are aligned properly?
---
I don't think OP has two brain-cells to rub together.
---
I want a t2 corm hull with railguns, and i will be content
---
I think there's probably still plenty of room for various different new ships. New ships don't necessarily need to fill a role never filled before or be top meta. A lot of current existing ships fill roles that are just filled better by other ships, but you don't see anyone having to justify their existence; they're there for people to tinker with, low on skills, to roleplay or because they think it looks or plays nice. There's always going to be a "best" ship for a given role. That doesn't mean you need to justify the existence of all other ships that try to fill that role too.
---
I see you have not been introduced to eve meltdown videos yet... Believe me, the insults are quite real, and if given the chance the person whom lost its toy would most likely beat the shit out of however did it. :(
---
Warp in, click modules, afk.
---
Not getting the point of this video. It's build versus build. Not skill versus skill.
---
&gt; we can dress up a DST into a battleship hull
---
They're already just shy of a BS hull volume, so no real need, there. Mastodon is 385Km3 vs the typhoon at 414Km3 Both are 50000m3 packaged.
---
Yeah, I guess our sync was so good, someone wanted to troll a bit and say they are all controlled by one pilot. In this case, it's all separate people working together on teamspeak to press the modules at the same time. Not exactly complicated. The complicated part is forming this up and the position. :D
---
Here's the thought - if there are too many supers and titans, create a titan killer.  Expensive as hell, very specific skills (can't use many existing skills) and limit  how many can be on grid at one time.  I'm not talking a one shot one titan kill thing, but something that really puts a hurt on titans.   The ship would only have one purpose - kill capitals and yes, it should  work on Roquals as well once the invulnerability core shuts off.  Otherwise, this ship is ineffective doing anything else  and a sitting duck to any frigate.
---
That was added because bookmarks were literally crippling the servers.
---
Yes, thank you! :)
---
Death from above.

DIE DIE
---
Falcon's job as community manager is to shill the game. For once the changes happening in the game align with his own viewpiont and so his posting has suddenly and very obviously perked up and become more lively, but, should CCP seagull return tomorrow and decide to start driving the game into the dirt some more, don't worry, he will obediently return to convincing everybody why more damage caps and 3 week timers are excellent for the game.
---
People tend to call these "hisec islands", a google search for "eve hisec islands" will get you some decent results
---
An old thread on it: https://oldforums.eveonline.com/?a=topic&amp;threadID=1393468
---
The most famous or infamous ones you find in Aridia and Solitude. Solitude is like behind Aridia, surrounded by nullsec.
---
I have to agree here... If you aren't in HS, you should always expect that what you are flying will be lost whenever you undock.
---
It is infuriating to be in a situation where you can be easily overpowered by a bunch of people, but then again... Eve was never fair. &gt;.&gt;
---
Honestly, I wonder if people ever comited suicide over loses in this game... Considering some of the meltdowns we see around, this is honestly a scary but quite serious possibility :(
---
The ship is already nearly impossible to kill unless you really mess up and don't have an emergency cyno out of high sec. Every other jump is either to an Npc station or friendly citadel. It's already safe enough.
---
Give me SOE destroyer. Or any cloaky destroyer. Or just fucking delete frig holes.
---
Is there any data on number of players that have faction capitals and number of people that at least were in same system with faction capitals, so we would see how many players had anything to do with those ships?
---
Nice vid and interesting overview of the fight.
---
The better solution is to just stop listening to ccp falcon.
---
Bots would warp off. This looks more as a multiboxin afk dude.
---
There should be an option like with duel requests to block incoming fleet invites based on standings or something.
---
Not like the current system where you actually have to block everyone from contacting you to decline all fleet invites (which makes it so you can't join other fleets manually.)
---
I thought you still had to wait the 24hr time? To be honest, this time back is the first time I've actually utilized clones. I only have maybe 270 hours played and it's mostly been in WH so I was never really worried about getting podded.
---
Also, be aware that the current invasion makes it pretty hard to solo in the game at the beggining. You have very painful NPC ships roaming near the stations and stargates. 
---
I came back last week after a very long pause, I had some very bad surprises during the tutorial of my new character.
---
How dare you curse on this christian fucking subreddit
---
PWS is recruiting, small (~15) C2 family of cutthroats and low lifes :)
---
Maybe a macro user. More than a bot...
---
The neutral way you describe your mistakes (and the opponent's) on the first flight was really funny. Don't blame yourself too much, I love your vids!
---
As a note for new players : check how much dps you actually have with your skills. There are a lot of areas where skills don't matter as much but with dps you have to have them at 4 minimum and rapid fire 5 is a great deal of dps. For example this maulus kinda attracts new players and they probably don't have the dps skills and that's why some fights are one sided.
---
Really fun fit!
---
&gt; Botting exists regardless of complexity, 
---
That's an useless statement non the less. Complexity greatly decreases bot amounts
---
And SP farms
---
There are no goons. There is only Zuul.
---
It cannot be 80 or 100k as it will allow you to haul and deploy L structures .
---
this tbh
---
This is pretty much what i do. I have my keep at range at 2.5km, if anything moves I hit my cloak hotkey and GTFO. If a bomber uncloaks and manages to catch me, I introduce him to my family of warrior II's
---
Battleship cannot go into places where DST can due to gates or total mass.          
---
Some modules (like BO bridge) are class locked ... so instead of messing with multiple mechanics you just create a BO with hauling capabilities and not DST that can jump and bridge.        
---
Simply much easier.
---
That's because most people use T2 or polarized setups that have less dps per isk but have more dps per toon.
---
HAM  and web bonus!
---
Knob, shaft and balls?  
---
But you only get the balls when you leave a bloc coalition.
---
To big, to much cargo space, to tanky and can be abused way to easily.            
---
Mining orca with jump drive ..... no
---
Daily reminder that period basis is inhabited by only hard working humans, not bots.
---
Are they even profitable these days?

&gt;in a ship that most expect to be a *bait*
---
ftfy
---
Imagine idolising an IRL convict piece of shit xD
---
This is a sandbox, if you can win objective before even fight can start it is your right to do it.       
---
If you want to deny enemy means of evacuation ... you have right to do it if you can pull this off.            
---
In EVE you agree to "die" each time you undock - i see no reason why this should not include freight hauling ships.         
---
What you are saying is: i want to put 100bil in my cargo and have 100% safety while moving it from point A to point B.
---
You know that i am proposing actually more capacity?      
---
Like check how big base cargo for a JF is.
---
While you're at it rebalanced black ops. Poor line hasn't been touched in years and are massively outclassed now.
---
honestly  I don't know anymore but it was very profitable for a few guys that made a lot of isk and needed a lot of plex
---
Skill points don't mean that much, he's just whining about how someone has/had more than he does.
---
Yeah, sorry. I addressed this elsewhere and forgot to edit this. You can get a total of 100K of hold by splitting the space between cargo and hangar so that it can't deploy a large.
---
But why?         
---
This is not to replace JF, but allow BO hauling in a reasonable manner.    50k is a lot!
---
(This is only what I remember back when this used to interest me)
---
Gallente is a "Democracy" but they're really run by bureaucrats and not by democraticly elected officials.
---
Caldari is a Oligarchy where huge corporation runs everything.
---
Amarr is an Autocracy, an empire ruled by a religious despots with an empress (I think) as figurehead.
---
Minmatar is a republic by name but is truly ruled by the larger clans.
---
Widow is broken as ECM died.            
---
BO was never strong, it was always about what it could bridge on the battlefield.
---
The Orca has no role in null with blackout... to slow, not enough tank to survive long enough for capital response, and no panic.  So if blackout stays they’ll have to look at it or it’ll be relegated to HS and maybe LS.
---
Lol ive seen shit believe me. Thing about eve and other mmos is that recieving end always has a kind of plot armor to counteract blatant toxicity.
---
Placid has one small constellation surruounded by low-sec

Transfer to karmafleet. https://karmafleet.org/
---
&gt; What you are saying is: i want to put 100bil in my cargo and have 100% safety while moving it from point A to point B.
---
No... what I'm saying is that logistics chains of dozens of blue citadels are significantly advantageous to larger groups while putting an absolute dependency on coallition standings to smaller groups in order to supply themselves.
---
Jump freighters with covert jump drives and covert cloaks would go a long way to addressing that issue.
---
Oh yeah for sure this can be done without input broadcasting, I'm just explaining what input broadcasting is.
---
They're all shit anyway. 1.5b isk for a battleship that can jump vs a carrier that after insurance costs about 300m. Yeah hard pass.
---
So dont? There are other ways to make sure you dont play with people you dont like .. for example actually knowing them. Or there could be other ways to limit what blues can do to ruin your game.. 
---
ESI is as much your ally as its is your enemy believe it or not.  Apha accounts and ESI leak a lot of intel without anyone actually playing the game. The fact that everyone has a spy in every enemy alliance is a huge barrier for new groups staring out.
---
If it has to be a new ship, it shouldn't be built out of SOE hulls. It needs to be something trained into the same way as other T2 ships. No way should racial BS III get you into this sort of ship.
---
TBH, I'm not a fan of the bridging idea. This ship should be a hauler. We havd BLOPS for the bridge role already. it can take a bridge but not generate it.
---
Yeah, EVE needs some kind of NDA'd focus group of some sort that CCP can bounce ideas to. Maybe there are better ways to do it than the CSM does currently, though I think its fine as is.
---
All the kills winderco cares about are the ones winterco is involved in i guess? pretty quick to add those to your own killboard. And you can always sync the others later on as they make it to zkill.
---
Because it's related to eve online?
---
There are some in all spaces. Solitude is largest. Caldari have one i  northwest, minmatar have one small one in northeast. Amarr have ones in Aridia and on the other side of their empire in Derelik.
---
Hate to rain on your parade but now that everyone lives in Malapais most of the alt corps and renters are going to BOT or just getting removed. Either is okay so long as the botters are getting purged and stay away.
---
no role?
---
it's one of the most popular ships in eve lmao
---
&gt; ut why?
---
&gt; This is not to replace JF, but allow BO hauling in a reasonable manner. 50k is a lot!
---
Have you moved many fuel blocks or packaged ships? I use a DST for this now and honestly, the 60K in my hold isn't that much and a total of 100K is still far less than a JF.
---
If the idea is to bridge through fuel/ammo trucks for BLOPS hunter fleets, you already have prowlers and other BRs.
---
As most will know, slyce alliance a few months ago were booted from gotg. The story following is my experience, and that of my Corp moving to our new home.
---
One beautiful morning at 3am sound asleep, my phone starts going crazy. I eventually get up to lose my shit at whoever is pinging me on discord after working 7 days straight. And then the news: we're being removed from gotg after just dropping 50+b on a soyito in our new system (we were removed from our old system to make room for the chinese botters of middle deklin).
---
 After spending weeks moving and re-setting up in 33r, we now have to move again - but no news on where we shall go. In the following weeks we had many offers to the Corp and alliance; eventually we decided to stay with the alliance and join pan fam in the drone lands. War was brewing and was partially held off to allow us to move out of the coalition. 
---
So the big consolidation began: moving everyone's things to txme (alliance staging). Routes were formed, stock piles of fuel were sourced, excess ore was refined and capitals were built (Inc a titan) so we could limit freighters needed. All in all I personally moved 2 supers and at least 20 capitals. 
---
First day of the move, everyone from the Corp chipped in. The move op lasted 9 hours; 18 freighters 5 orcas plus many capitals being bridged by titans Keepstar to fortazar to keepstar. We eventually landed in 15w to call it a night and continue the move the next day. 
---
**All was going well considering, and then the next blow: the keepstar in 15w unanchored during the night, leaving hundred of billions of isk in asset safety 2 days before the war officially started. **
---
Many tears and worried people freaking out: "how do we continue??" Talk of rage quitting was definitely circulated. But morale won the day, and we decided that we shall not give up, we shall survive to come back and enjoy our revenge on gotg. 
---
Finally the timer ended and we managed to get all our assets to the fort- time to bridge freighters out to the next system in route. Log on the titan, bridge, log off - making sure hostile eyes didn't get too interested.
---
After 5 days we had completed the evac out of 15w. The rest was pretty easy until the regional gate of 'germanate to the kavala expanse' - being 9.9au distance, only a jump frieghter or rorqual with jdc 5 can make.
---
Over 2 days, with eyes *everywhere*, we gated freighter after freighter... 100's of billions of isk of members livelihoods though gates. 50+ dreads and carriers, multiple supers and titans. But the fun wasnt wuite finished; half way through moving the freighters through the regional gate, CCP decided that *now* would be an awesome time to start having local chat and server stability issues! Fun times indeed.
---
Next stage was moving our sotiyo, few caps and a titan which was easy considering the previous move.
---
So all in all we moved to our new home and only 2 freighters died, luckily with nothing of value inside... **After 6 weeks**
---
My story is but one of many within our alliance. Yes we bled some members, but we are rebuilding to our former glory and better.
---
Yeahhh, you can just assume you don't and warp gate to gate and 99% of the time you're fine.
---
Plus, if you live under one of the super umbrellas (like most nullbears do) you're fine, fear not.
---
Only one party having to consent will always stay that way. Of course everybody is going to post that lossmail from a gatecamp to warn others, that's their damn right after losing their ship.
---
ESI is necessary so killmails can be verified, otherwise the whole system would be useless when everybody can just post fake mails all day.
---
Still activity growing on the post it looks like, so I did what I could from mobile to help w/ formatting. Hope it helps!
---
No
---
Just started listening.  Glad to see someone making a decent Eve Podcast again.
---
The closest thing you'll find in Eve is stocking a market somewhere in lowsec or NPC nullsec.  Use a blockade runner or jump freighter (or DST if you've got huge man balls) and list modules at exorbitant prices.  Profit.
---
The agreement was no faction hulls, I purposely left them out of my comp. Had I known I had to fight Bhaalgorns and T2 logi, I would've brought a slightly different comp. Still stayed until the very end. Love maelstroms, love artillery.
---
It is not just one constellation, it is one and a half (plus one extra system). It actually matters a lot, because the highsec-half-constellation blocks these 3 systems from the possible locations of the blitzable level 5 missions given by the agent in the lowsec half. Thus, these missions only spawn in the same system as the agent, or in two neighbouring systems.
---
It'll probably come out right around the time we get shield slaves
---
The push for less information is shooting /r/eve in its foot. Since the dawn of EVE both the hunters and the hunted went to great lengths to acquire data, and who can better use this data become better at the game. By looking at zkill and the in game map you can pretty much figure out which systems have huge fights or have the biggest krabs, then react to it. Zkill especially provides a way for people to track big fights even if they are not in game, which is handy for people at work. If anything I would say that's the most distinctive part of EVE --- it's like playing chess, where people can see each others' pieces (though only after they blow up), where whoever makes the better use of it wins. Playing chess blind doesn't make it play like StarCraft, it just make it like shitty chess.
---
Now, I understand the argument that bots can easily abuse local chat and what not, but zkill should be out of this. Nowadays it's essentially a part of the game, and as Squizz tasted it firsthand, this change sucks. It's hard to conceive how a change can simultaneously make a game awkward to play and good for the game, and the delay is definitely making it awkward to use zkill.

Lvl 5/4 spec skills really only matter if you are solo. Even with 1 or 2  dudes having meta fit is 95% not a big difference.

The Vanguard (serpentis carrier) actually still has a model ingame as well as skins for it.
---
Blackout Will not help you there. You need to close the chat window if want to avoid the scam span.
---
PS: by the way, selling Geckos for only 1 millon!!!
---
There's a nice one in Molden Heath if you're looking for a new home.  Close enough to Rens (small market) and easy access to multiple null areas.  Some lowsec pirate types still live in the area, although they're more cap hunters than small gangers.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they made it so that the drones rep more than a regular T2 logi ship would.
---
Travel time would be a huge drawback compared to remote reps, and along with the possibility of smartbombing them off or shooting them, an advantage in rep amount over remote reps seems fair to me.
---
I thought TEST who blued Legion of XXBotsXX and Kids With Guns/Mango had the best?

My point is more that you can become "the" zkillboard from now on by running a direct copy. Just need people to start using it over time

Its not supply and demand when you control the currency.  The desert makers control the currency, i.e. they can debase it.  They have only used one way to get rl$ but the other way is game oriented and they are starting on that.  The trick is to make a trillion isk tomorrow buy what a billion isk bought today.  Bring on the declining buying power of isk and you solve the bot problem thru npc mechanics.  What do you think all those npc ships are going to do in nul sec?  Just look pretty to shoot?  Do they give game rewards?  What of going forward?  Enjoy the decline.
---
Came to this thread, excited that it finally exists. And now I’m sad bc all of the post so far suck. Get gud, scrubs.
---
Why even PVP if you don't get killmails on a killboard as accomplishment?
---
Rote Kapelle is elite small gang? who knew.
---
I'd like to trash talk [this kikimora pilot](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78111653/) for having a reaction time so slow that he got killed by a cyclone on a gate, and also his gang for booshing me off and then leaving him to die alone while I kill him and moonwalk out.
---
SHIELD SLAVES WHEN
---
Well the closest you'll get has been mentioned a couple times. You'd have to bring capital ships from A alliance to B alliance and resell them.
---
Other than that, this kind of thing doesn't really exist in EVE.
---
I NEED YOU TO SPEAK UP I CAN'T HEAR YOU
---
Yep, the armor hp set was renamed to "Amulets" and a new shield equivalent set was introduced as "Slaves"
---
CAPS LOCK SCRUB
---
Yeah, time yourself doing laps around it then do a time lapse video of that :P
---
Well yes, but having ability to move out in JF 500 bil means that you don't pay 75bil in safety tax
---
And the more steps and annoying something becomes you know what that means?
---
Many bots.
---
If you say so
---
BAHAHAHA WHAT A RETARD HE DIED YO A CYCLONE PILOTED BY SOMEONE WHOS PROBABLY LOGS IN THREE TIMES A DECADE TO SET MORE BLUE STANDINGS LMFAO
---
For islands i think in only on system. Like Piri, on Amarr Space. All its Gates are to lowsecs.
---
Don't know if that kind of systems could be useful somehow.
---
Dran personally assured me that test and legacy are anti botting and would never harbor confirmed botters.
---
They unanchored it but we were giving the wrong Intel by 2 days lol

LMFAO SUCK IT SCRUB HOW U LET ME KILL U U LIL FUCCBOI DOES UR DADDY OWN EVE TOO WILL HE BUY U A BLINGIER SHIP NEXT TIME TO WIN THE FIGHT PUSSY COWARDS NEVER WIN FIGHT ME 1V1 AT THE JOVE SUN IN PODS COWARD U WONT.
---
This is not a JF.          
---
Honestly JF cargo space is to big.         
---
People will hate it - but i would also like to see freighter with 10.000.000 m3 of cargo ... still it is not good for a game.
---
Then go mine in null during the black out and let me know how that works out for ya.
---
Missing important points :              
---
* can jump to covert cyno        
---
* have fleet hangar of 50k           
---
* can BO bridge others

That is where you are wrong. More steps does not mean more complex.
---
There's always the guy that doesn't link killmails tho
---
They will not change anything.           
---
JF is most vulnerable while getting in/out of higsec and lowsec and when it is traveling in higsec.              
---
Supply on alliance scale is not issue when you have NPC station/lowsec in range.
---
Orca is higsec rorqual. Why you use orca in 'k' nullsec ?
---
Yeah, that's a pretty good fit. It's close to what I generally use and it's pretty awesome. It really shines once you lvl5 all the relevant skills though so if you haven't and want to use it I would seriously drop everything else your learning and just skill into it.
---
I was loosing so many that a secret Santa gave me one I don’t dare undock.

This is why i don't want it.    
---
I prefer a BO battleship with 50k of cargo and no weapons.
---
You can use all of the races ships up to battleship as an alpha.
---
Trig mining barges when
---
Thanks!
---
If that’s the case there is no reason to not just go with the race I prefer aesthetically?
---
Due to the cost of faction caps it would represent a significant ISK risk on grid if used, if a corp brings one then it provides a major advantage, but also a major potential loss, you could say the same about blingier Leshaks (some corps use 900m fits with clean pods, some corps use 1.5B fits with mandatory slaves).

&gt;Well yes, but having ability to move out in JF 500 bil means that you don't pay 75bil in safety tax
---
And there is a guarantee every single item will arrive. That's not the case if you get unlucky in a move op. 75B is a lot in absolute value but it pales in comparison to 500B in relative terms.

THOSE [LAST](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77856203/) [TWO](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77856287/) WERE SOLO WINDRUNNER KILLS XD.  IT TOOK A 40 MAN HORDE GANG A HALF HOUR TO CATCH ME SOLO ON THAT GATE AND THEY ONLY SUCCEEDED BECAUSE I WAS TOO DRUNK TO REMEMBER TO WARP AT RANGE TO MY BOOKMARKS.
---
people will be unsure, see plex drop. remove thier plex from market, and actually raise the plex price xD by doing so
---
Not unless this is 50 JF runs.        
---
At this point you are down to like 18bil max lose (cargo and hull).     
---
Depending how far you are moving... 50 JF runs can be as low as just 1 day of work.
---
THAT DOESN"T LOOK LIKE A LINK PUSSY
---
SCIENCE! - The only way to know is to try and be willing to start over if your hypothesis is incorrect.
---
If Amarr ships make you happy then try them out to see if they work for your play style. Only you can answer this question as most of the people who will answer you on Reddit are in it for the meta. Play in the now and figure out where your meta play style will be by learning what you want to do now from the many things the game has to offer.
---
OK, mate. You've convinced me. A DST or BS indy able to BO jump and bridge is a bad idea. It sounds like all you want is a huge fuel bay floating bridger. this is nothing more than an end run around having BLOPS BS with BR support in favor of one ship to rule them all. Pass.
---
Did you try the in-game map?
---
Big oof
---
There's nothing wrong with a bit of Tengu.
---
Of course, its not working like all the pro 'delay' people thought it would, so it must be the fault of the ESI system. When that's changed and you still aren't getting your easy kills, what will you blame next?
---
No this is about ccp falcon suggesting giving JF ability to jump to covert cyno and fit covert ops cloacking device.         
---
From 2 evils i prefer "DST" with jump drive rather than JF warping in cloack.
---
Hey mate, it's awesome your thinking of getting into the game! It's really ever to late to get into the game. If I was to recommend anything it would be before selling your soul to some null sec blob, try out highsec life. Highsec will get you accustom to game mechanics just generally teach you alot of things the game has to offer. 
---
If you ever have any questions pm me and I'll give you my in game name and would be happy to answer any you might have.
---
In my opinion Eve is a lovely game with alot of great people to meet, try not to get caught up with the isk grind and just try everything you can.
---
Skill Points. Right.
---
NERF NERFS
---
yes please - i love the unique bonuses on pirate ships. they are by far the most fun to fly imo.
---
Pretty sure ManFace MissileTits won EVE.
---
I'm not sure I know what we are even arguing about. Are you in favor of being able to move your shit with no risk for a 15% magic user fee or are you saying we need to provide the opeion of moving (and maybe catching) JFs during an evac? Because the latter, I am all in favor of.
---
I'm not in a position to do to do the math right now but 50 one way jumps (which is unlikely) at max range would add up in fuel cost.
---
GIVE US A FUCKING LOWSEC GATE TO STAIN ALREADY WHAT THE FUCK
---
Why not 20 ?   
---
I know that "skilling will be slower" - but at this point we are getting to point where no skill progression is needed as you can define and give specific number SP for a "day" to each player.
---
If you want proximity to gate campers, there's a small one in Lonetrek. 
---
Easiest way is to pop open dotlan, and start clicking on each of the regions and selecting sec status.
---
I would think there is no dino side since there was only one party involved and he never cried for help, not that I would have helped him for being stupid.
---
Hard pass on making the t2 trig ships more accessible though - those shits are way OP. Balancing with isk is kinda silly too considering how late game it is and nullblocs, etc.  
---
Nerf the fuck out of them, then make them more accessible i guess.
---
It will have almost no affect. It seems like the local blackout is not working too good anymore at generating easy kills, and it won't because large alliances have "adapted" and pretty much all of the sub-cap ratters have disappeared.
---
&gt;I have some other Maulus fit ideas that I want to try out, hopefully this is the first of several.
---
According to your PYFA screen, we can expect 21 more Malus videos.... 
---
One can only hope.
---
I am in position that JF should not get a covert ops cloacking device.
---
&gt;  and fit covert ops cloacking device.
---
&gt; From 2 evils i prefer "DST" with jump drive rather than JF warping in cloack.
---
And if that was all you were suggesting I'd be onboard. But that's NOT what you presented.
---
Some of them are variants of other, and some of them on getting the fit complete I decided it was not particularly good.
---
FIT A CYNO IS LIKE MY THIRD FAVORITE EVE VIDEO EVER FUCK YOU FOR MAKING SUCH A HUMOROUS VIDEO
---
Another fantastic video. I really enjoy the tone of clear and rational self-criticism you adopt in these videos. It's very probably one of the major reasons you're such a solid solo pilot.
---
Still worth it.
---
it suck asteroid
---
BPCs from pirate raitarus in low sec, difficulty level on par with FOBs.
---
Just before the goon vs panfam glassing NC/PL unanchored a lot of citadels. Sounds like Slyce got a rough deal.
---
but, but... chaos era and fog of war!
---
yeah there probly cancelled because off how bad the npc sorties  did, almost not one runs them and its all done with cheesy  way's, this its to hard, to much work, for to much risk and so little  gain.  
---
at lest as far as i know.
---
How are you finding PanFam? Anything you miss from GOTG?
---
LOUD NOISES
---
Factor in different infills now too, I assume you use prua slic3r so for like 10%, 15, 20
---
Unless you're doing it in null...
---
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SALT MINE THAT THE REMOVAL OF ASSET SAFETY WILL BRING.
---
Meh, as long as the net rate of skillpoint gain is not significantly lower than Optimal remap and +5's, which is 2700 per hour/64800 per day. Round to 65k for evenness. If the game breaks it down to say, 55k per day passive and 10k that you get from an activity, that would be fine too.
---
I don’t hate the delay. It still updates, and u have he kill report and can load it if you want to earlier than the system auto loads. Pros: doesn’t give free intel to hunters
---
Because it is fun and a challenge? But it could be any reason.
---
You would still get killmails, they just wouldnt be public.
---
time to hang up your spurs boys, gna be a long time before you top that one
---
Yo Cloon where you at
---
There are two highsec islands in molden heath. It’s pretty chill. It’s surrounded by a circle of lowsec systems. It’s close to Hek and Rens. Nullsec is close too.
---
I lived there for a few years. If you are self sustaining then it’s nice to live on these islands.
---
No.... just wait for rebel space outlaw, starbase or who knows maybe star citizen will finally get released?
---
*botters
---
Say it with me
---
Supers shouldn't be allowed in anomalies.
---
You not wanting the imbalance go away has no bearing on the facts or what will ultimately happen.
---
There's nothing illegal to smuggle because there's nothing illegal.
---
&gt;  am in position that JF should not get a covert ops cloacking device.
---
I'm with you on that. No need to propose a new ship, then. :)
---
zkill/anyother site just needs to use the ingame link and only post the killmail if it is from [evetech.net](https://evetech.net) site any other address is just dismissed. that way killmails can't be faked.
---
I've said it before but i still think eve should move to a kill/loss score card remove information on fittings and location of kills/losses.
---
All that rage for a 1 bill ship...
---
Apparently this guy just rides solo in expensive stuff looking for trouble.  So he's dumb, but he's fun dumb.
---
Depends on what you consider main i suppose?
---
I mean i have a PvP clone that just has combat skills,
---
I have an industry clone that builds my ships,
---
I consider the industry my main, but it could just as easily be my PvP...
---
Nerd.
---
Rote Kapelle killed once nearly with a small gang of Phantasms and my Raitaru in O-V a Bean Naglfar. They must be elite.
---
Just play as a free to play alpha. It's a fun game.
---
&gt;At this point handing out ESI access is just a private data breach waiting to get sued for.
---
You can't sue someone over something you gave up voluntarily with full knowledge of what they would use it for before hand in real life. Good luck making that case about game data in a game where the EULA states everything on your account belongs to the company...
---
Everything dies eventually, especially great PVE ships fitted for WH effects. I’m assuming you know but kinda forgot that a properly fit PVP ship will kill a PVE 1v1 more times than not. Why else are krabbers crying about getting ganked ( asides from when thy are outnumbered).
---
While you found one resource, you can also look up zkillboard to give you other ideas, too.
---
Don’t forget iron crowns myrm bots
---
Right, this game needs more invulnerable telepott mechanics, if they are cloakes even better.
---
Why are you against actionable intelligence products? The whole point of generating intelligence is to take a more informed course of action.
---
In my case. I was talking about using multiple accounts on pods over a región, posting non blues on local, so everyone 5 jumps away from him could dock.
---
Now, you need actual players to gather info.
---
It means mundane and repetitive, you are right
---
Now, tell me.  Why do people bot? because it’s so riveting and fun?  No.
---
The opposite.
---
Wot
---
Ouch, that's a shame.
---
Police skin Erebus
---
Trusting some rando fit off workbench is less intelligent than using Zkill effectively.  Just because something died doesn't mean it's a bad fit.  I look up groups I know fit and fly good doctrines (think Tuskers, Hard Knocks, anything Suitonia or Stitch K, etc.) then I sort by the type of ship I'm looking for.  If you see multiple losses of the same fit, there's your starting point.  Plug in your skills and use Pyfa to tweak as necessary.  
---
For wormholes, check out the losses for major groups.  Putting a little effort in can reap huge rewards.  Or you can just post that Zkill fits are terrible because the person died.  I'll let you decide which way is more effective.
---
Honestly, I'm a little pissed about the whole thing. I came back to the game after 6+ years to trade, then spent the last two months writing a server application to manage and analyze market data. Then they go and double the taxes/fees. 
---
I just got the damn thing working and spitting out optimized trades, then this shit happens. I have the sinking suspicion Eve is going out of business soon.
---
Mayonhen Const in Aridia

You guys led the wicked creek loss mails, that's for sure. Are you still down there loosing rorq's in pipe systems?
---
REEEÈ
---
Facts that they can jump to cov cynos and have 50k fleet hangar are worthless. They don't get used in spite of both of those.
---
Glorified 1.5b covert bridge ship. Not the intended use of a whole line of t2 battleships.
---
I shouldn't be at a handicap for jumping my black ops onto something over just jumping a carrier.
---
Meh last week a reddit post had a link to a youtube channel that sells bots and had vids on how to set up a bot. Looked very simple.
---
I'd be that pissed if I lost a ship to Slycers.
---
Not surprising most renting alliance are down numbers. Only legacy seems to fair well, licky because a good war and army of mangos still growing strong. Easily explained by the blackout. The steep slope in the post is due to PL losing a lot of space, Tenal and Tribute are currently not is NC/PL sov portfilo. 
---
With a lot of new sov going the way of new PamFam members first, this slope will not improve for a while. Maybe when GoTG get taught the KqK keep star was not worth the cost.
---
Thank you for all the fun.

SOMETHING ABOUT PANDAS
---
Someone tried to ninja my last site. Trigs popped the catalyst. A vedmak burned 70km off to chase it down as soon as it landed.
---
Brisc deserved the ban.  If not for cheating, then for being a dickhead.
---
The price for PLEX moving upwards. It is now at 1.850.000 ISK per 500 PLEX in Jita.
---
wormholes should have the chance of blowing up your ship,
---
or alternatively if the ship is too big to go through, it should just blow up.
---
\-- shitpost on your shit post
---
Since there is a SP cap on alpha accounts, the obvious solution is to have four alpha accounts, one for each race, then train them in parallell. In a way that quadruples your training speed (Not really).
---
I agree to choosing a Gila.
---
I think he's Russian so he can't really answer you right now, or something.
---
&gt;There is already access restriction - kill is available to only two characters and their corps and remains private unless someone already having access changes that and publishes it somewhere.
---
That is not an access restriction because the issue is the information in the killmail. Once that information is out, it has no restrictions. The only way to restrict it is to ensure it isnt there.
---
&gt;It's like that since killmails exist (even back in the day there were actual mails, having "Read mail" XML API access allowed any 3rd party tool to read said kills). 
---
This is a flawed argument and means nothing. You had wardecs for 15 years until CCP woke up and admitted what everybody knew - they were bad for the game.
---
&gt;And here is the thing: if they are published, they are published will full info, there's no "partial kill info" available, you either share everything (including potential information you'd like to hide) or you don't share it and hope for other side to do the same.
---
Yes, this is one change that can be made easily. This system is unethical and bad for the game since it causes the killboards with all related problems of free intel and risk averseness.
---
&gt;Actually, it's usually losing the fight that has no negative consequences 
---
That is demonstrably false. The loser has the fit of the ship made public and is also forced to have a profile, which means you are now searchable. This is very useful for people who only take fights they know they can win.
---
&gt;(outside maybe your reputation if you care about killboard stats) for publishing the kill
---
That is a big deal because people dont want a red killboard and some corps "punish" players for that. This causes less content because of risk aversity.
---
&gt;you already lost the ship and sharing the intel about it with everyone else around doesn't hurt you at all (and has the potential to hurt whoever killed you if someone's watching over zkill
---
It is true that the public killmails can go both ways. This is another argument for limited killmails based on player choice. It is false that the sharing of the free intel doesnt hurt you. It allows players who were not part of the fight to get free intel on you.
---
&gt;Zkill info is something you (any anyone else) can play around if you know how it works, and you can even use it for purposeful disinformation with a bit of effort.
---
That seems irrelevant and I dont see how it's possible in general since killmails are verified by CCPs api.
---
&gt;I know this amount of effort and planning isn't necessarily what everyone wants to do in order to gain an advantage, but isn't that exactly why it's good? 
---
If the purpose is to make the free intel useless, that establishes that the free intel is a problem. CCP must allow limited killmails that dont contain certain information if a player so chooses.
---
&gt;As just yet another tool that allows someone who wants to put a bit more effort, a bit more time and planning to get slight edge over someone else, with very high ceiling of what you can achieve - and usually ending at "not worth the effort to continue" instead of "did everything possible".
---
This is a completely different discussion.
---
That's some serious word spaghetti. Did a bot write this comment?
---
Jesus sick kills man, that vaga kill is nasty. The gank version is deffo awesome, I just hate not being able to rep myself. Personal preference.
---
SOME RETARD TEST STREAMER WAS GETTING ANGRY AT PL NANO SHIPS FOR NOT COMING TO SCRAM RANGE, THEN SAYING THEY WERE RETARDED WHEN THEY CAME INTO SCRAM RANGE, I DONT EVEN.
---
no
---
Jeeezzzzuussss that's nuts haha. I have a hard time spending 75m on one, I think it's overpriced xD
---
Wtf
---
Honestly, game knowledge has a bigger impact than time investment. The first three months will be catch up, and after that you are free to do whatever you want in game, if you are willing to learn the mechanics.
---
What? It’s 3.5-3.7mil per Plex
---
&gt;Is it "too late" to catch up and enjoy eve? 
---
No. And with skill injectors (much as I hate them) your ability to catch up SP-wise has never been easier, if you have RL cash to drop.
---
BRISC CAN'T HEAR YOU
---
ok
---
Cool story hansel.
---
The Ishukone/Thukker thing was in my last post but some edgelord rp weirdos shit all over it. I still think Interbus QRF is absolutely ideal for the skillset.
---
This one on Cura, due to better support generation and adaptive infill.
---
Thank you for the reply.
---
It is about the Thukker Tribe doing something big in Drone regions. 
---
Old chronile about Project Skymother: 
---
[Chronicle:Present Pieces](https://fiction.eveonline.com/stories/chronicles/present-pieces)
---
&gt;"This piece was recently brought back from a wormhole in Akora. This piece," she said, pointing to the second object, "was found in the archive. Labeled, probably by some idiotic student, as 'detritus.' It was retrieved from a very old excavation site on Matari Prime ― Matar, I mean ― sometime during the last century. Never properly dated."
---
&gt;[...]
---
&gt;"First, the age. I ran some tests, and the first object dates back roughly fourteen to fifteen thousand years; the second, this one here, only about slightly less, probably within less than a thousand years of the other."
---
&gt;"So late Yan Jung Era or shortly thereafter."
---
&gt;"I think these things, both of them, they're some kind of old acceleration shell equalizers. But it's the size! I mean, with equalizers this big, the engines themselves would have to have been, well, absolutely enormous. I mean, a ship that could house an engine this size must have been… Well, no modern dreadnought could even compare!"
---
&gt;Just a few hundred meters out, the shuttle swung around a landing bay on the surface of the massive, unmoving vessel. Only a tiny portion of the behemoth was visible in the forward visor.
---
The city ships have popped up recently in news:

https://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/galactic-hour-news-roundup-capsuleer-day-yc121-edition/
---
&gt; Leak in Thukker Mix Reveals Next Gen City Ships
---
&gt;EZA-FM IV – Leisure Group publication Eagle's View published extensive documentation and video evidence of a major Thukker city ship project, late last night. The anonymously sourced evidence confirms suspicions that Thukker Mix and Core Complexion are collaborating on the construction of new city ships using technology recovered from several expeditions into the Rogue Drones regions. The source, claiming to be an engineer, says their leak was motivated by concern about the poorly-understood technology, which has a record of behaving unpredictably.
---
&gt;Timestamps on the digital documents date the start of the project in YC111, though research missions in the Rogue Drone region had apparently been ongoing for several years prior. Construction is stated to have commenced in several Great Wildlands deadspace pockets during YC114. Eagle's View has told the Scope's Galactic Hour with Ret Gloriaxx that their investigation into the ultimate disposition of the "city ships project" is continuing.
---
I think the news about Thukker Tribe activity in Drone regions started in last year already. Just small snippets in Scope videos.
---
k
---
Thank you for the epic video.
---
BRISC IS A DICKHEAD!!!!!
---
WAITED SO LONG AND YOU FELL SOOOO SHORT.

Yes, mundane tasks make people want to automate things because they are not fun, while complexity makes it harder to program bots. Two different sides of the coin.

ROAMING TWO HOURS SOLO IN NULL JUST TO BE DROPPED BY A SUPERCARRIER
---
THANK YOU FOR POD EXPRESS. DID NOT WANT THAT SHIP ANYWAY
---
IM JUST HERE FOR THE SALT.
---
GIVE IT TOOOOOOO MEEEEEEEEE
---
Zkill links exist for a reason.
---
Also any more details besides "hitpoints got reduced to zero", that makes this one stand apart from the multiple supers that are dying all the time (not implying this is a bad thing, there clearly are too many of them around)
---
You can use all ships on all races and there are no penalties, not even training times. This also goes for alphas. Race choice is purely cosmetic (and rp), besides a negligible amount of allocated starter skills. Also amarr ships do not suck at all.
---
One tip: Don't fall in the newbie trap of trying to stay safe. Eve is a pvp game in its fundamental design. The devs suck at creating pve content. You get by far the most out of it if you get out of high sec asap. Nice things to try as a noob are Factional Warfare, joining a newbie friendly small wormhole corp and do exploration in null/wormholes. These activities will not only teach you the basics of navigating a hostile pvp game, but also are way more lucrative than anything you can do in high sec. For an experienced players it's very easy to plex an alpha account from scratch.
---
Also don't join the big blobs. You won't find a sense of accomplishment in those and like staying in high sec that is a good way of burning out.
---
Triggered

YES I MISSED THESE

FRIENDSHIP FRIDAY IS NOT HERE YET SO I CAN SAY !!FUCK YOU!! I'VE BEEN FEELING LAZY LATELY. ALL I WANT IS CONTENT DELIVERED TO ME WITH ZERO COMMITMENT FROM ME. HOW DO PEOPLE EVEN PLAY THIS GAME LIKE THIS FOR YEARS??????????????

WORK SALT IS REAL. 5.5 HOURS LEFT IN THIS DUMP UNTIL I CAN GO HOME AND HARVEST TEARS. GET FUCKING RUDE BOYS!!

I was thinking: head, shaft, prostate... as I'm sure those flying in sov bloc umbrellas get their prostates milked on the reg.
---
I’ve dabbled in most aspects of eve.  High sec missioning, low sec small gang roaming and even set up shop down in provi for a bit running sites, day tripping in wh space.  Now I’m 4 days out from dst/blockade runner. Now.. stupidly I only fly ships I like to look at. As an ugly man I want to fly pretty ships so I’m going with a bustard.  Everything I’ve read has said occatar/impel for massive tank.  How gimped will I be and can anyone suggest a good fit for my future hauler.   Currently residing in a high sec island but just need it to handle one set of gates.  Mostly ferrying loot spoils. Might try some contract hauling if I buy enough liquor this weekend.
---
WHAT A RETARD

This shit doesn't even make sense. Put some God damn effort in instead of reposting r/all content with a loosely related title.

It is funny.

Solitude, aridia, are some

It is very important that the delay can be bypassed to get to that free intel, isnt it?

SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED TO GET GOOD AND FIND A WAY TO SMASH WHILE AT WORK
---
GOOD THING NOBODY CAN HEAR YOUR SHITTY FUCKING OPINIONS
---
The problem is that they become public and the consent might only be one way.
---
&gt;If you're in a corp which automatically posts killmails then you're consenting by being in that corp in the first place.
---
Are you saying the these things cant be separate?
---
&gt;Only one party having to consent will always stay that way. 
---
Only if they think its good that players have no say in how their information is used.
---
For FW fleets green is better because it keeps you from getting suspect timer and possible demotions with standing losses. Use yellow only if do not intend to ever lock friendly targets.

Yeah, they are that retarded.

Look at the BR, we killed 10 pods, all empty

I laughed. Thank you for this post StainGuy.

After we killed them they warped back to the belt in pods

me, trying to board another ship after docking, but the server doesn't let me because of session change timer the first 3 times i try

idk i use red all times
---
The PVE video is tasteful.
---
I love when Trigs drop lock on me to kill a dessi
---
thats why i dont kill the anchoring ones if i can Tank the dps
---
I'm mostly good with this. I shudder to think what absurd price tag CCP will give them, though. JF are expensive and blops are absurdly over priced, mix them together and you're paying the cost of a super for a battleship hull.
---
Yep. There's a lotta armchair API design happening in r/eve at the moment and I'm not sure the people who are doing it are qualified to do so. Designing good APIs is something that a lot of professional engineers don't have the expertise to do, let alone people from other professions :) 
---
I modestly submit that given it's sheer size and the wide range of use cases and deployment scenarios it supports, ESI is an above average quality API to work with. There are a lot of much smaller API's dealing with much less complex material that are much worse to use. It'd suck to screw it all up by implementing some knee-jerk reactionary measure without thinking it through.
---
Bear in mind though that because downstream consumers have to update their software and then potentially deploy it out to phones or third party servers or whatever, changes don't happen on a dime. They happen on coordinated, predictable schedules, as professionally managed resources should. The standard schedule for ESI changes requires a minimum of 6 weeks to trickle through. That represents a balance between not putting unrealistic pressure on third party devs and not getting bogged down with low-value high-burden backwards compatibility. Off the top of my head, I think we've only broken that schedule and sped things out early two or three times since it was implemented, usually because of a flaw that threatened server uptime.
---
I've been speaking with a few people on the CSM and in the third party dev community about this for at least the last 3 months, since well before the blackout, and I'm hoping I'll be able to kick off an in depth review of which parts of ESI are helping the game and which are hurting it during this CSM's tenure. The ideal would be to create a cohesive plan with clearly outlined goals and antigoals, a clear statement of how the current endpoints meet those goals/antigoals, and thus what needs to be changed. This would mean both additions to meet goals, and removals to avoid antigoals. A prioritized changelist would then be implemented on a schedule over the space of a year or so, similar to the original XML/CREST-&gt;ESI migration. **I can't make any promises on this plan** because I need commitment from quite a few other people to pull it off, but that's my dream.
---
However, it's not as simple as "delete everything" or "delay everything". I'd caution people against advocating for that, lest they get what they ask for. Delays *might* be one tool in the toolbox, but we don't want to be using hammer-drills to solve problems that require sand-paper. We need to consider and understand our problems *before* we start picking tools to use on those problems. Quite a lot of people here would be very frustrated if jeveassets or evemon was always 24 hours delayed :)
---
Such are the current thoughts in my head, which may or may not turn into tangible outcomes over the course of this CSM. Comments and alternative perspectives are welcome.
---
Should we tell him there are places that aren't nullsec?
---
Thank you :)

Screw mini jf I need a damn super JF, 1 m3+ cant enter HS can only dock azbel or larger.

How often do omega deals/discounts happen? When can we expect next one?
---
It's summer and there was just a sale on PLEX. Now's probably a good time to invest in buying to hold.
---
Umm, that's what he just said. 3.7 X 500 = 1850000
---
PROBABLY
---
I'm not arguing that setting up a bot is hard, I'm just saying that you need to have a baseline knowledge of the game to know where/how to set them up to be profitable without getting caught by CCP in a week.
---
Don't feel bad. My accounts are from 2009, and I've missed years of training time.
---
Just do what you can as an Alpha. Limitation breeds innovation. You may find in some cases you can still pull off clever tricks in the game without the best ships available.
---
I honestly doubt this game will be around next year or so.
---
&gt;Before zkill, killboards were more for tracking stats, reviewing battles, etc. 
---
Probably, but the stats tracking has to some extent always been a disguise for free intel. There is no reason why it must to be this detailed. Zkb has become the Facebook of eve, and everyone is forced to participate.
---
CAN'T BE PART OF THE PROBLEM IF I DON'T LOG IN! CHECKMATE, DICKHEAD
---
The magus video is nice.
---
Ive never seen them kill the ninjas before. Something must have changed. They never aggro my salvage boost boat either. But they made it a point to kill that catalyst. 
---
That being said, Ive had enough run ins with reinforcement fleets showing up on grid containing multiple Leshaks that I dont risk keeping the anchoring trigs around.
---
wow im honored man that's really....FUCK I MEAN GO CHUCK SOME LIQUID OZONE AND FART OUT A BEACON RACKEM RACKEM
---
500 PLEX \* 3,500,000 = 1,750,000,000
---
500 PLEX \* 3,700,000 = 1,850,000,000
---
I am seeing 2 dead Marshals. wow.
---
I'm not against inteligence. I'm against use of automated one and external source. I'm against of being able of multibox 6 rorquals as watching Netflix. Because some bot pod docked on an athanor report on vintel every nonblue sig.
---
If you gather intel, having scouting roams, or active gate camps on choke points, then cool and good work.
---
I want shield variants of astero and stratios, with shield instead of armor resistance bonuses, -1 lowslot and +1 midslot and launcher instead of turret hardpoints.
---
It actually makes people risk averse because they dont want to risk giving up their fits and get a red on their kb.
---
Closest thing i do to smuggling is deliver hulls to faction wars and double the price lol, does that count?
---
Nerf tz tanking and darkness would die over night
---
Ok. Bot it is. XD.
---
PS: thanks for doing Bob's work
---
While I haven’t lived in a pulsar for over a year now, I used to use PYFA to go about simulating fits with the pulsar effect factored in. If you ever want to pm me on reddit or send me an evemail to Razeleao, then I could go over some fits for whatever class pulsar that you’re living in. I’d also suggest looking at eve survival to get dips/neut values for sites, or [this google doc.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSbMMEBlM5BAFXldnnX3GDGfUp02OAuMznRljKkbpH4Ff3SyNTrkyEjHSJGkNJsDPqypSZw3sQmQ1Ta/pubhtml#)
---
Blingy WH FAXes already have "ez tank until downtime" problems, let's not add a bling hull to that problem.
---
No but it definitely makes me feel better than most of the degenerates in the Corp, so it's got a therapeutic purpose.
---
Nice
---
Fraternity and Horde have also been good for this. I'd bet that Simple Farmers would also add Test to the list. Basically any of the big null blocs will have enough casual or stupid players to provide the opportunities necessary to leech off of them.
---
&gt;No one who plays this game in any kind of competent capacity wants kill mails to be delayed.
---
You are not talking about the killmail, since you get that immediately anyway. You are talking about the free intel from kills you were not part of.
---
&gt;not because people have instant intel (which has been a huge part of the game for a long time).
---
The importance of free intel to cherry pick fights has certainly gone up significantly.
---
They change targets frecuent, as far i have seen is not about dps, and usually they hate salvage drones, my berserks usually dont get shot, but my salvager get poped as popcorns if i dont keep an eye
---
And usually a new ship on grid can triger lock, thats funny to see
---
Thank you.
---
Dishonorable fish skunk warrior fuk.smell idiots
---
Because you give away your fit, and people risk failing in public by getting a red on their KB. This causes risk aversity because corps are known to "punish" players for it.
---
Care to share some examples? I’m honestly intrigued.
---
Ive lost a couple salvage drones but far more sentries. My personal observation seems to be they have weighted target selection based on RR and damage, with RR having a higher weight. When I used 2 RR boats and a vindi, the vindi never got shot. Now with 2 vindis and a logi, they swap between the 3 regularly, but spend more time shooting the logi specifically. 
---
Ive had ninjas warp in numerous times and never draw aggro prior to yesterday.
---
Smuggling under the nose of the EULA. That's some true EVE player shit.
---
What about a jump modual for transport ships?
---
Mordus legion destroyer please 😫
---
ur moms tackled at the top belt 
---
she's bad @ videogames lmao
---
The too much text was due to reddits text-cap. Not because Falcon wrote too much. 
---
Are you dumb? I am of course going to put more effort into my response than detailing theirs. Jesus christ.
---
That shit happens to me more than I care to admit.
---
Between Shaks/Dreks/Ikis and Bhaals breaking a FAX is no longer the cancer it used to be, you can break them within 2 triage cycles (they melt through cap charges and it's not hard to boosh fuel trucks off).
---
Bro? Straight up dont give a shit.
---
Thats true and maybe chucked in afterwards, but when you think "fast shield missile boat", you don't think Gallente imo
---
UR TACKLED AT THE BOTTOM BELT AND NO ONE HEARS YOUR PLEAS FOR HELP
---
CCP's official stance on in game chat, scams, and anything bad happening strictly within the game has been HTFU, or "harden the fuck up". So, I guess there's your rule. It's up to you to not be a dick, but if others are dicks to you in game CCP don't really care how you handle it as long as it doesn't spill into the real world.
---
About five days/2m sp in, but a returning player. What’s the best way for me to get into some small group pvp to get some basic experience?
---
&gt;it's like playing chess, where people can see each others' pieces (though only after they blow up), 
---
Its not. It would be like knowing your opponents moves before he makes them. Likely fits and ship types are what you are really looking for. Thats why the map isnt enough.
---
&gt;Now, I understand the argument that bots can easily abuse local chat and what not, but zkill should be out of this.
---
It is surprising then that you dont seem to understand that people use zkb to cherry pick fights.
---
Doing gods work.
---
Nice Video! What's your IRL time?
---
You mean you want to see what player x is flying RIGHT NOW. Yeah, you shouldnt know that.
---
If it's 100 bill yet that's a good hunt
---
About 5 hours. I think I could get it down much lower as this was my first time. Not sure I would find 40mil in loot sitting on a gate in a repeatable manner though!
---
better be overpowered as much as i gotta spend on one, fuck.
---
About the guys you bled, If they leave on hard Moments, then you don't need them.
---
Whoa I thought he had my username in there for a second and was mad confused
---
I would ignore that piece of general advice about Gallente ships.
---
* Their advantage is negligible, especially as an alpha player.
---
* There are few bad ships in EVE, some are just more niche than others. 
---
* You can cross train into other racial ships as an alpha.
---
* Play the way you want. EVE is a brutal game but the rule of cool still applies.
---
I agree with extending the Blackout mechanics.
---
It sure has a nice glory hole.
---
REALLLY PL! you're gonna drop super, dreads, and titans on my poor t3c pair. FOR SHAME! how dare you think me smart enough to NOT tackle the PL orca baiting on a gate. In my excitement i opened his zkill but began engaging before looking at it, RIP ME, it was all t3c baited kills xD
---
tldr: leet t3c dudes dies to leet t3c bait.... praise bob for content!
---
that doesn't mean the ship doesn't have a role you idiot
---
WHY CANT THIS TERRIBLE GAME JUST FUCKING DIE ALREADY SO I CAN UNSUB AND NEVER GET PULLED BACK INTO CARING WHAT ALL YOU SCUMFUCKS ARE DOING! DIE DIE DIE
---
ADCU were a mistake.
---
You will never catch up. Eve is a complex game, and has many similarities with real life, you encounter many unfair situations and you learn to avoid them. You're playing as a tiny fish in the deep oscean with sharks, and you learn to avoid getting eaten. It's that way for everyone, even if you've been playing for 3 years like me. So, it's never too late, you just born and enjoy every part of the experience in your path to the top.
---
Or 5% drone MWD bonus per Gallente Cruiser then go whole hog on drones and bump up the drone logi bonuses.
---
&gt;Speedrun
---
&gt;take a few mins to create character
---
FUCK ROCKS
---
just off by 3 orders of magnitude :P
---
Test no, but rent to them...
---
Your information? I killed you/I died, either way the killmail is mine to do with as I please, same for you with your copy.
---
Whoa, thank you so much for sharing all that, that's really cool. That would be really interesting and a huge implementation by ccp
---
yeha maybe ccp is doing some fine tuning on the weight of the targets, but its total fine for me, pro tip, use faction Berserks with TP, not sentrys.
---
im on a fleet of 4 Ratts, 2tp and 2 webs.
---
we clean the sites fast and can hold lots of trigs fleets on world ark perimeter with almost zero risk
---
Trying to make video approachable to newer players. You are right though, could definitely have shaved some time off.
---
No test has plenty of bots, come join us and you too can watch the en-pl bot washing machine in action in eso, we kill the odd couple every month or so to keep up appearances.
---
[TEST BLEW UP MY BATTLECRUISER.](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78205717/) FUCK YOU TEST. YOU DONT KNOW WHO I AM, BUT YOU WILL, THAT I CAN PROMISE. YOUR SPACE WILL BURN. YOUR STATIONS WILL DIE. RENTERS, RATTERS, NOOBS, SUPER PILOTS, SMALL GANGERS, I MEAN EVERY SHITHEAD YOU ASSHOLES RECRUIT WILL LEAVE YOU IN TERROR AND PLEAD FOR MERCY. I WILL NOT CEASE UNTIL YOU AND YOUR BUTTBUDDY GOONS ARE THOROUGHLY FUCKED, DEAD AND GONE. 
---
YOU MADE A MISTAKE DESTROYING NEEDZ MOR-LUCK'S MYRMIDON, AND I WILL MAKE DAMN FUCKING SURE YOU SONS OF BITCHES AND EVERYONE YOU KNOW PAYS THE PRICE. 
---
(ingame ofc)
---
I had so much fun mercilessly booshing every fleet away
---
There's no difference between instant and delayed for that.
---
I CANT FUCKING HEAR YOU!
---
FUCK THE BLACKOUT, BUT I ALSO KINDA WANT TO THANK CCP FOR MAKING ME WIN EVE. 
---
SINCE THE START OF THE STUPID BLACKOUT, I HAVENT BEEN ABLE TO DO THE THINGS I ENJOYED. SO I DECIDED TO NOT PAY FOR OMEGA ON MY ACCOUNTS ANYMORE SINCE I FOUND THAT PAYING FOR SOMETHING THAT YOU DONT LIKE IS STUPID. KINDA ANGRY THAT I WONT WIN EVE GOING DOWN IN A BIG BALL OF FIRE, BUT OH FREAKING WELL!
---
ALSO, OUR SPACE IS PERMA CAMPED BY ARTI CLOAKY NUILLIFIED LOKIS THAT GO AND CIRCLE JERK WITH THEIR FRIEND EVERYTIME THEY ''SOLO'' KILL A BARGE. KILLING A BARGE IN A SHIP THAT CANT BE REALLY CAUGHT THEN WARPING TO ONE OF YOUR 1000 SAFES IN THE SYSTEM AND CLOAKING UP AGAIN DOESNT MAKE YOU L33T.
---
ALSO, CARRIERS ARE EASILY KILLED. HALF OF THOSE BRAIN DEAD CARRIER PILOTS ARENT EVEN IN FLEET OR COMS. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS  DROP THE INHIB, **KILL HIS FIGHTER** THEN KILL HIM. IT'S THAT FREAKING EASY. 
---
DONT WHINE ABOUT ''CYNO OP PLZ NERF'' SHIT. PILOT THAT KNOW WHAT TO DO AND ARE ON COMS GET SAVED, NOT THE DUMBFUCKS THAT ARE SPAMMING INTEL CHANNEL ABOUT THEIR STUPID ASS GETTING TACKLED 'CAUSE THEY'RE SO INBRED TO JOIN STANDING FLEET AND COMS.
---
IF CAPITAL PROLIFERATION OR WHAT EVER YOU CALL IT IS SO BAD, HOW COMES YOU DONT BRING YOUR OWN TO THE FIGHT ?! DROP A DREAD OR 2 FFS. THEY'LL MOLESTS ANY REGULAR CAPS. HECK, MOST KRAB SUPERS I KNOW DONT EVEN HAVE ANTI-CAP FIGHTERS IN. BUT YOU COULD JUST FREAKING **KILL THE FIGHTERS** FFS. DEFANG THE MOTHERCLUCKER AND HE WONT BE ABLE TO DO SHIT.
---
CARRIERS AND SUPER HAVE A HARD TIME TRACKING SHIT. IF THEY DO TRACK YOU, IT'S BECAUSE THEY HGAVE LIKE 3-4 TRACKING MODULES FITTED. DREADBOMB THEIR ASSES. THEY SACRIFICED TANK FOR MORE ISK/H. ALSO HALF THOSE CUNTS DONT EVENT HAVE ANY FAXES ON STANDBY/FLEET/COMS/EXOTIC DANCER IN THE HOLD.
---
\*MORE RAMBLING BLABLABLA\*

\*A N G E R Y KRAB NOISE\*

You died! You can't talk anymore. Shush!

---
Xresloracknor, as you can see in the picture, they both seem happy.
---
I only use sentries for the Leshak. Double web vindis with skirmish links delete frigs and dessies in 2 shots. I dont drop drones until the end. Currently experimenting with Ascendancies and warping onto the Leshak from a ping. That would allow for max DPS ogres.
---
As a solo null pvper, the delay is obnoxious and hurts players like me way more than the big blocs who already have it easier than anyone else in the game.
---
WHERE IN THE SHIT ARE ANGEL DREAD/TIANS. 
---
WHERE ARE CALDARI/AMAR/MINMATAR FACTION SUPERS???
---
HOLY HELL WILL THE /FIX/ LOCAK FINALLY AND REMOVE IT FEIN AMAZONS SERVERS.

REEEEEEEEEEEEE

YM, SWEATY? I JUST SPENT THREE HOURS COMBING THROUGH ALL YOU ZKILL SOLO KILLS FROM THE PAST TWO YEARS, AND OOF THAT'S A YIKES FROM ME. I LITERALLY CAN'T EVEN RIGHT NOW. OH SWEAT SUMMER CHILD, YOU DO REALIZE YOU ARE MAKING ME LOSE ALL FAITH IN HUMANITY? I'M LITERALLY SHAKING RN. LETS UNPACK THIS. IT'S ALMOST AS IF, JUST MAYBE, YOUR TOXIC, GARBAGE KILLBOARD IS THAT WAY BECAUSE SOMEONE HURT YOU. JUST SHIT UP AND LISTEN. IT'S CALLED BEING ELITE AND AS AN ELITE SOLO PILOT, **YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE.**
---
LET THAT SINK IN...
---
You're trying to communicate with us I just know it. Hut I'll be damned if that made any sense.
---
adding advice in a slightly different direction:
---
after you have acclimated yourself in this game, make some more accounts and have them train characters with different skills than your main pilot, so you can try out more :)
---
Great idea. We don't have enough balance issues today, so let's introduce some more unbalanced ships! ;-)
---
god's work
---
fuck sort
---
Do you bot or have you ever made bots?  I mean this respectfully, but you have your mind made up about something that just isn’t true
---
Nope
---
Where you buying my PI for 10 times the actual value?
---
sort keeps on giving, god bless tau aud
---
That's not a great argument in favor of new ships, though.
---
7 frigates equal 4 caps 3 supers
---
u right
---
nom nom nom nom
---
DEFINITELY,  HE’S IN FUCKING TEST
---
It's never too late.
---
Eve's skill system is one of diminishing returns. You can quickly get the skills to be competent in one specific area, but it takes much longer to gain a more significant edge.
---
There's a constant churn of players leaving/taking breaks, and new players joining in or starting fresh or alt accounts, and after a few weeks you won't be a clueless noob with no skills, but an adept player on your way to mastering the areas of the game you've chosen to skill towards.
---
The most important thing for new players is finding a good corp. Lots of big alliances have new player programmes but personally I'd avoid them at first, because you tend to be cannon fodder and can feel a bit anonymous. Look for some corps, stick around and see what it's like, and if it's not doing anything for you, move on to another.
---
You can get fined in the EU for failing to provide what data you have of someone and dont have a documented central record of all data you keep and why you keep it .. and failing to delete it upon request. And where did I agree do hand over what exactly? This is a click I give to CCP and then they hand over data to 3rd parties where it gets even more hairy. The. If big unanswered question is if eve data you cause is even yours to begin with.
---
Ah if it should help people, I think the editing should be different. Would need to be way shorter, more like a "recipe" on how to get to T2 abyssal than a speedrun
---
Still not as steep as the server pcu slope tho
---
#totallynotblues
---
I am trying to get into ratting and PVP. I want more isk. I been part of mining corps and that shit is slooowww. I got exposed to WH hole rats and his clouds and such?...I was spoiled. Crew has been offline so I need some new folks to teach me the ropes and guide me. The learning curve is so steep and I don't have a lot of isk to waste yet.
---
Negative isk per hour? I think you need to get into a fit that doesn't use ammo then... aka Amarr fits
---
Been away for QUITE awhile now (probably 2 years)  
---
Recently re-watched The Expanse and getting the itch again.  
---
Have 3 accounts that I could light up for Omega(?), but my Main Char was pretty much solely PvP. Plenty of old nullsec experience. 2 other accounts were my Carrier, and Indy alts  
---
TL;DR I want to get back into EVE, not really sure where to start looking. Or even what I want to do (dont want to fall into the Nullsec trap of "Be on for x amount of fleets per week or else your kicked". Been there, done that)
---
i luh u
---
your numbers are way way off , you are clearly doing something wrong in those activities
---
[Besateoden](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Molden_Heath/Besateoden#npc24) Constellation in Molden Heath. Of which the Orien system, 0.8, is usually the hub, having a 0.5 and a 0.6 on either side as buffer to lowsec. Plus the most NPC stations in the constellation. I lived there for a while when I needed a break from Level 4s in Teonusude.
---
So you're against all out of game tools that provide situation awareness to players not directly involved in the fight, etc?
---
ALL HAIL KING WHBOO!
---
Most T1 ships suck balls. **fixed**
---
Oh, sure Ferox is OK when fielded in numbers (until bombers delete them) but most T1 subs are absolute shit today.
---
Actually all ships are pretty much ore assembled in small sections that are then placed together.  Everything from naval frigates to super tankers.  It would be safe to assume that something as large as a space station would also be built this way.
---
well i got rejected, sweet.
---
Higsec isk /h     :              
---
* LVL 3/4 blitzing  - 60+ mil/h           
---
* Burner mission running  - staring from 100mil/h if you choose proper faction                 
---
* Incursions - starting from 150mil/h               
---
* Abyssals - 200mil+/h for T5
---
but moms spaghetti
---
Hisec islands sound like great places to live till a large group decides to cut off your supply chain
---
&gt;Relic / Data sites - About 500K-1.5M ISK per hour
---
What? Are you taking a half hour break between pushing the scan button?
---
Many people do, I am not doing it here, but completely agree, it's obviously better :)
---
Oh I am ok, EVE is a game, and I am comfortable playing it not well. Would like to play it better of course, but you win some, you lose some. 
---
Agree on the new player note, I put the caution in my Max Gang Slasher video, I should have put it here too, I have max skills, drugs, implants to make this work.
---
The biggest Tech 2 fleet combat ship are HACS. Command ships are skillpoint prohibitive to pilot and not price effective, Marauders and Blops are not meant for fleet fights.
---
You'd see less Feroxes if there was a T2 BC or BS hull with good EHP and projection that can be skilled into as part of normal progression.
---
Thanks man, I have been blessed with a realistic self imagine, and a desire to improve, which has been an enormous asset in almost everything I have done. I am very lucky.
---
Thank you!
---
Invasions - 50-100m an hour
---
WE NEED A BETTER CANDIDATE TO PICK UP PENGUIN'S WADDLE
---
Nearly every single major alliance requires ESI registration, so they already have access to the permissions needed.
---
Boooooo don't change existing name that has been here for our whole lives you absolute mongs CCP.
---
Well first you have to figure out what you actually want to do and how you’re going to sub accounts. Plex is much more expensive now a days. 
---
Also I don’t think anybody has fleet requirements like that anymore. Be active is a common one and a few fleets a month or every few months isn’t uncommon but if you’re not doing that what’s the point in joining a corp?
---
I’d look at NPSI fleets. Bombers bar if you’ve got a stealth bomber or Spectre Fleet for a little of everything.
---
Think he is only doing it in high sec.
---
Whatever you're smoking while playing EVE, you need to stop smoking that, and maybe you'll be coherent enough to actually hit undock button and make more isk, even in high sec.
---
To reiterate... most **T1** ships suck balls. Specifically subcaps. 
---
While I think it would be kinda cool to have a straight up T2 combat BC (gibs me a Vaga BC with a side of making A/C great again) I wasn't talking about T2 ships.
---
You always make me want to play more and even make videos. I'm currently abroad and eve doesn't run that great on the small laptop, also all my settings are at home, it's just way more comfortable on the big computer..
---
Lies. You start buying loose pants to sit on your ass all day, waiting for that one cap pilot to undock.
---
THIS AIN'T A GILA, THIS IS A DREKAVAC! SO WE BURNED THIS LOCAL TO THE GROUND!
---
If you like being a villain... there is fixed that for you
---
It’s not really because bigger ships aren’t just better.
---
It’s basically pay to not have to do PvE or isk making.
---
There is my group which runs mostly Armor Invasions most weekdays and I stream it.
---
Triglav Defense runs about as often, I believe leans towards shields and operates out of their discord.
---
Entropic collective is lead by sixstrignwiz and his friends, runs several times a week and tends towards shields (or Trig only fleets) 
---
Additionally, it only takes 2-3 people at most to run a minor, so there are lots of solo and small gang groups running around. Give it a go!
---
&gt; Every time CCP makes a new playable ship, they have to come up with stats that are not only balanced for the class
---
hahahahah my friend what game have you been playing for the past 15 years? Every time CCP makes a new playable ship, it is wildly and ridiculously OP, for a long time if not forever. T3 cruisers... T3 destroyers until nerfs... Kikimora...
---
Subbing accounts is not an issue
---
And by "make x fleets or your kicked" I'm talking old NC. Days where if you didn't make like 4 fleets a week and 2 CTAs you were spaced. That's just too much, I'm not looking to make EVE my other job again.
---
It's been a while but I honestly don't think my numbers were even close to that low in Highsec. Certainly combat sites are very lucrative when you can grab them and relics still pay out nicely.
---
&gt; No one who plays this game in any kind of competent capacity wants kill mails to be delayed. If it needs to be explained to you why, you are probably a thicko.
---
Is this the "no true 1337 pvper"? 
---
Besides, a big part of the stagnation is the fact that excessive intel gives you the hability to cherry-pick fights.
---
solitude has lowsec island within an highsec island, and even a smaller highsec island nearby
---
sadly there is no highsec island within a lowsec island within a highsec island
---
I don’t think it matters at all anymore. It used to be buggy and complicated with buying plex and things depending where you made the account.
---
I don't disagree with that, my point was that even the commonly used T1 ships (Ferox) is not all that great and sees use because there's no T2 equivalent/superior in role. If Vultures weren't so expensive and locked behind leadership you'd see them over Feroxes.
---
I think if you actually start a timer when you push the play button and track the cost of ammo etc these numbers could be pretty accurate.
---
&gt; Burner mission running - staring from 100mil/h if you choose proper faction
---
Is there somewhere with a guide on these? Never tried one before so I'm curious. Want to run one for SCIENCE!
---
Did you just apply in game or through their site? I’ve never heard anybody get rejected from Karmafleet before besides the worst of spies.
---
Some people take the thread title as a challenge don’t they?
---
TEST flies both, using whichever one fits best with the objective.
---
Some days just didn’t feel like pulling out a Rorq.  With local it was somewhat safe to use an Orca and Covetors.  Not now...
---
Ah poor dato, he's a nice guy at least. We had a good time talking about slicer fits
---
I honestly had no intention of doing anything like a tutorial but after having a ton of fun making this. I think I might do just as you are saying, step by step recipe, even just getting into T1 abyssal. 
---
Next video here we come!
---
EVE HAS SOUND???
---
Like google burner missions guide.... you will find all info including unified fits ... that never fail.
---
OK, I misunderstood and thought we'd gone on a tangent. I agree it's not great.
---
But my bigger problem is how much ahead of T1 all the other ships are. Sure, I get that they are cheaper but a decently fitted cruiser is going to run 25-50 mil, so not something most of us want to lose in droves, and they WILL lose.
---
I don't mean I want them to compete on the same level as a 100MIsk faction cruiser but the difference between them should be narrowed.
---
and I want my goddamned autocannons back. :)
---
Do the math for a keepstar.... those things  look like they are being 3d printed in space anyways.
---
God forbid you have to go back to using scouts and actual having mates find that information. 
---
What, are we 2009 peasants again?
---
&gt; google burner missions guide.... you will find all info including unified fits ... that never fail.
---
I put too much effort into finding the highsec pockets in lowsec for the other thread, so now I'm lazy and you're usually so verbose, so I figured I would give it a shot.
---
The mighty beans are recruiting!!
---
It still is fine if you are working from a mineral source like jita that was short on ore recently.
---
Acronyms, acronyms everywhere
---
You can't nerf organizations. EVERY change you make will be a possitive for big organizations, and any nerf will hit soloers harder. There is nothing CCP or any other game developer can do about it.
---
Ooh, burned your Reddit alt early eh sharo

COGG Y U SO TRASH

[NOBODY HAD SCRAM ON YOU WHY DIDN'T YOU WARP OFF](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78243504/)
---
I love to open a HS hole that goes into Aridia or solitude 👌👌
---
There are no goons. There is only Krab.
---
That is why they need to make null ratting even better like 3x the quantity of escalations would be a good start
---
Thanks a lot for the info!  
---
I was wondering for our fleets what are the most needed? I do have a alt with 100% boost skills which could come by in the commandship fit if the demand is there for it, else which of your fits do you recommend i come by with?
---
The website, my application looked fine to me. Really don’t know what the problem is...
---
Well fuck
---
JOHN BLATHOS YOU CAN ROT IN HELL.  I WAS PROMISED EVE FUN LIKE OLD TIMES AND WENT ON VACATION.  LITERALY NO ONE DID ANYTHING YOU INCLUDED.  A WEEK OF BEING EXCITED IN VACATION TO GET BLUE BALLS.  YOU SMELLY BITCH I HOPE YOU DRINK GAMER GURL BATH WATER AND GET AIDS.  &gt;:(

I agree in principle but most areas of space are so dead that intel like that is a necessity. Personally I hate killmails and the amount of intel they give, (person, corp, ship, target, number of involved parties etc) It's too fast, there's too much info available and it's too easy to get. That said if you just remove it without any sort of replacement you hurt people who roam for content because unless you know an area really well and know who lives where and where they rat and what timezone. Personally what i'd like to see is a usable in game map (please ccp it's STILL a mess) and some sort of change to the ships / pods killed in the last hour filter, maybe decrease the time frame to 30 mins.

How do you think the chem got lost? During the “not putting up a fight to save the fort” event?

It's not about cherry picking fights - you think there are so many fights happening that you can 'cherry pick them' - no my friend, its about finding any fucking fights at all.
---
&gt; BECAUSE SOMEONE HURT YOU
---
HIS NAME IS WHISKEYCAT
---
He is our deep undercover Novak spy, shhhh don’t tell anyone
---
And if not join a Corp. It’s probably the number one thing that is recommended to new players, as many Corps are very welcoming and can help you get a grasp on the game. Just find one with people you like and and enjoy playing the game with.
---
Sure you can counter them if you dedicate enough to doing so, but that heavily constricts the doctrine choice.  Plus Leshaks are already pretty oppressive as a WH doctrine, from what I understand as an outsider, so not feeding into the shaks or GTFO meta would be wise as well.
---
statistically, 90% of HS holes lead there
---
&gt;you think there are so many fights happening that you can 'cherry pick them'
---
No, I think there are so few fights happening that it's noticeable many are cherry picked. It's also noticeable many fights are avoided for no apparent reason.

Logi is the number one key. You need to have good boosts, but there are generally several willing to (in my experience). One of the hardest but most needed roles to fill honestly is salvager. After that the field opens up. You need everything from 8-16k brawlers (preferably ones who can hit fast frigates), 40-45k Battleship killers, Zorya chasers, and 75k+ Pylon killers in World Arks. 
---
It is mostly about if you can hit my tanking threshold of 60/75/50/75. I prefer 65/80/60/80, and Logi need to be close to, or past 90% in both explosive and therm.

Downvotes aside, the in-game map is actually a good tool to easily find islands like that: https://imgur.com/a/LpyPdc3

I'm in your channel now, guess its a bit easier to talk there
---
&gt;I agree in principle but most areas of space are so dead that intel like that is a necessity.
---
Somewhat agree with that. I think there are several reasons for this. One reason is risk aversity. When players get punished by their corp for having a few reds on their KB, they tend to hold back.
---
You rang?
---
Yes, having to roll half your chain because you got one those is super fun.
---
Look at mr. bigshot over here with his 23 carbon in 1 can. Meanwhile i only get 5 carbon per site. Rigged game
---
If you get the free intel faster, you can make different decisions. If you know what someone is flying right now, that is an advantage.
---
Instant killmails do not help all groups, and they hurt the game.
---
i mean, might be just me but i would prefer seeing more non faction ships that are somewhat useable instead. i simply like variety. Its generally a bad idea to me to make most ships obsolete just by adding a ship thats 10 times better for like twice the cost.  sure something like a caracal or normal vexor have its uses but for the most part! especially on the pve side where people dont plan on losing ships too often it just feels weird at times. if you plan to build a ship for something. lets say ded sites as an example and you look at all the cruiser options you have. how many cruisers are in the game? why would i pick ANY of them over a gila. it does not cost that much more but it is THAT much better. i just wanna see more usable non faction hulls as an option and not faction hulls become the standard for everything.
---
While achieving perfect balance may not be possible, this doesn't mean they shouldn't even try to get closer to it.
---
They can still make balance passes to make the meta ships less dominant, and to make the weaker ships better - that would at least give the players a wider range of choice for effective gameplay.
---
Fighter mechanics aren't enough though. Super ratting is click intensive also because NPCs die and you need to retarget. If you wanted to make Rorqs more like supers, then you'd have to add mechanics like Rorquals breaking rocks into smaller chunks, then excavators bringing them to the ship. Which also means high effort change for CCP.
---
It would just promote pvp, i dont get how you all downvote this so hard and 170 upvotes on a make more pirate hulls thread. I think you are retards.
---
Nobody said the balance should be perfect. What you need to do is at least reduce power disparity between similar ships.
---
Well it was kinda my idwa behind the post
---
Looking over the fits on that site there of questionable quality, realistically you better of specially for pvp just taking some random solo pvper and stealing his fits of zkill. 
---
For pve it's often not that hard to come up with a fit ( plus it's a good learning experience given all your target numbers are known ).
---
&gt;And where did I agree do hand over what exactly? 
---
When the corp recruiter asks for it, you have the choice of saying no, or saying yes, if you say yes you have agreed to give them the data being asked for, for the purpose of the background check they tell you they are going to run. And no, the data you cause in EVE is not yours, there is no "big question" all eve related data is the sole property of CCP as stated in EULA you agree to before installing and playing the game.

All of these are high skill activities that take a lot of know-how before you can do them successfully and get those Isk/Hr rates.
---
Most of my EVE to date has been played on a laptop, although as of this last year I am not traveling any more and am playing on a desktop. You're right, it's way easier on a desktop.
---
Oh, no argument there. There's not even a perfect point to approach - only a set of time-limited local maxima, if you follow me.  The very act of rebalancing is good because it shakes up stale metas and gives new ones a chance to appear.  We just have to accept that the new normal will not be any more balanced in a true sense than the previous.
---
Its hard to break the habbit of point and click.
---
Speaking of burned reddit alts ;)
---
It's yours according to what? The majority of the information on the killmail is added by the "loser". There are many destroyed modules that without them being listed on a KM you wouldnt know exactly what they were.
---
It's reasonable that both players have a claim to "ownership" of some of the info on a KM. The problem is that because CCP provides all info without restrictions, those who want a limited killmail have no say.
---
i dont wanna touch on general markets here but i wanna give my 2 cents on the botting part. i only use 2 accounts because i dont like afk activities, i do 2 active things at a time and thats usually enough attention.  
---
BUT
---
i really dislike the "bot" term lately because this has become the norm for everything that does not require constant attention.  There are differences between "botlike behaviour" "actually using a 3rd party bot" and "doing something that can be done idle" 
---
nowadays EVERYTHING is called a bot no matter if this person is even using a bot or not.  Take miners for example, especially ice mining. Those guys usually sit in their orcas icemining for hours untill their cargo is full.  What do you expect with an activity like this? for them to stare at their screen for 3 hours? do you actually hack their computer and see what they are actually doing? maybe they are not afk but simply eat, read a book, watch something on netflix and have an eye on their orca on a second screen. They are not afk technicly...they simply dont press any buttons because they dont need to. and this goes for other things like ratting aswell.   YES i dont like bots, i dont like afk activities myself either BUT you cant simply call everyone a bot simply because the activity can be done without pressing buttons all the time. 
---
its such a narrow black/white mindset to look at things and using a generic word to describe EVERYTHING. you watch someone orbiting with drones? must be  a bot, you watch someone not moving in an astero belt shooting rocks? must be a bot.
---
i simply cant hear it anymore.
---
Indeed, and I always struggle a bit with "How much MORE time and effort should I invest in EVE", but you're right, as you say, it's obviously better.
---
Thanks for this.

Not suggesting nerfing them with the zkill changes.
---
Just wondering why give them anither advantage they don't need?
---
The delay helps organizations and hurts solo and small gang, so why?
---
oh
---
Here's the thing, if you are up against an Armor FAX and you have no Leshaks/Dreks then you already have issues, sure, it may benefit the Leshak Meta, but when every group brings 'Shaks anyways, what does it matter...
---
&gt; So dont?
---
If the ESI was totally blacked out as in completely inaccessible there would be no way to even attempt to avoid it.
---
&gt;The fact that everyone has a spy in every enemy alliance is a huge barrier for new groups staring out.
---
Blacking out the ESI will make spying 100x easier, you won't even need a clean char to spy because no one can check your history. Got a huge donation to spy for someone? No one can check. Got the dodgiest history ever? No one can check.
---
You cannot find out someone is a spy by talking to them and getting to know them because get this: ***people lie.*** I know this is a new revelation but you have to believe me here.

Ok even so you could spend the next half hour scanning in high sec and not finding anything but worm holes

---
Don't fly a loose rorq. You never know what you might catch.
---
On top of all that from the comments that guy seems like a real unclassy piece of work.
---
Yes, there's a few scattered around. You can use evemaps.dotlan.net to find them.
---
They're usually pretty empty, and if the LowSec systems are also a pocket (meaning, it's only a couple of systems surrounded by HiSec), those tend to be pretty empty, too.
---
For the combat/relic/data sites, you need to move a half dozen jumps or so away from Jita, all the good ones there get scooped fast. Wormholes and/or Null are even better.

&gt;who knows maybe star citizen will finally get released?

1mil in stuff is on the extreme high end of the value of a can in hisec. Highsec data/relics are complete trash.

Hey lone hows it going

Probably lmao
---
Grab yourself an astero or Stratios to do the combat anoms and signatures. The thing you are looking for isn't the loot/bounties from the sites themselves but the escalations. The escalations have a much higher chance of faction spawns than the anoms/sigs themselves and many of the DED sites have overseers that can drop deadspace items.
---
Also if you want to do it guristas space i reccomend finding some quiet low sec areas to do it because all of the greater jita hisec area is ***absolutely infested*** with gila bots that will scour all the sites clean like locusts.

It might not taste good, but it is good for you. People who blindly accept fleet invites need the wake up call,  no matter what coalition they belong to.

You have plenty of say, don't fit your ship or stay docked and you wont have to deal with someone else doing what they want with your corpse.
---
The reason amarr ships aren't recommend for alphas is that amarr ship design favours mwd kiting fits due to lack of mid slots, and alphas are very limited in their nav/cap skills which are very important for kite fits. Also faction war plex entry mechanics (where you'll probably start out) are heavily biased for brawling fits which is why 99% of the FW populace never learn to fly manually and remain bad. If you start inside the plex as the defender you will develop a chronic depression as your opponents only undock tracking disruption or faction/pirate frigates, and after four hours of plexing your one and only T1 foe immediately jumps out unless you're in point range (which means you're automatically dead against mwd brawl fit). Then as the general fw playerbase gets to know your name and associate you with mwd, they will start camping the entry warp gate because they're affraid to fight you with auto scram/web defender's advantage, so enjoy warping in at 40km. Tldr, plex entry mechanics are bad.
---
The reason amarr ships are said to be bad is because the people flying them are bad and can't fly them properly or lack the proper skillpoints to fly them.
---
It is not working either way. Every large group is infested by spies even with perfect vetting of every chars history. We need other ways and if ccp  wants to force us to form smaller groups .. this is the perfect way. Cause spying on small groups is a drag on the enemies resources.
---
I'm chatting with them now. Thanks. Everybody hold on the pitchforks plz.

yeah they said they had founding members of brave with them so its possible they have the people who made the logo and artwork as well.

Nope newer players that worked to get some isk to buy ships and then had assholes who steal from them.

This seems so disingenuous that it's blatant propaganda to keep people from doing stuff in highsec. I can do one site in highsec and pull in 300 mil. One luck escalation and it's upwards of 800 mil. Mine in peace, no stress, no fuss. Get ice and more. 
---
**Highsec is like a vacation from the madness that has become null.**
---
All your characters are active on Singularity by default. Even if you aren't paying for eve, you can buy plex for 100isk on there and use omega time. Only applies for sisi.

Compression is free if you send a few minutes looking for it, and you can pull 15-20 mil isk per hour mining in high sec if you have the skills and knowledge.

"Catching up" is a flawed concept.   EVE, being a sandbox, is about the story you create within it.  That is both the game's strength and weakness.  
---
It is a bad game if you want the game to guide you or you need a consistent reward drip.  
---
It can be a good game if you are willing to pay for the highs with what can be long stretches of tedium and disappointment.   Finding a group to play with and mitigate the lows is generally viewed as the key to surviving.  Misery loves company and all that.

Actually, Brave is a 501c corp IRL, so trademark and copyright laws do apply.  I don't think it will get to that.
---
What? We have 13 real people and run carrier and JF logistics without owning a citadel. If you want to live further out in null, logistics are harder, that's basic geography.
---
Interesting.  Which of the tax exemptions applies to Brave?  Is it Charity for feeding kills to other groups?  It can't be preventing cruelty to animals or children...
---
Skilling naturally in Eve has always been this way. Queue up your skills to get into your doctrine ships, use meta modules for stuff you have at lower levels still, grind isk as best you can until you can upgrade. Eve is a really hard game, it can take a lot of work to get established. If you feel like your corp isnt helping you, and it sounds like they could do a better job, find another Corp to call home.
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/alliance-logos-you-submissions-re-opened

The alliance could use is outside of Eve should they choose, although it would probably require approval of the creator of the logo.
---
Do exploration. It’s way better isk/hour than ratting as a newbro, plus it’s fun and will teach you a lot about the game.
---
Actually the game had a massive resurgence when it went f2p. Most cities have 400-800 people in them. I’d wager player counts rival Eve now.

My corp kept me afloat when I had 4 mil isk in my pocket and it's a relatively small sec corp. Im tired of asking for donations, selling shit for above jita, buying it for below jita, etc. 
---
Plus, I've been looking to get into lowsec pvp, because I love the adrenaline of killing and losing ships. But it's simply not a solution because eventually I'm going to run out of isk, and then I'm back to square 1
---
Also it's mostly the alliance fcs in Razor, which I'm hesitant to fly expensive fits for anyways, because  they're Russian and comms are rarely in English
---
Lived in J space for a long time.  Never really heard of them, so I think calling them "hugely disliked" is a major stretch.  Methinks you're spinning a narrative.

After the Caracal loss in the 2nd T1 site (due to me having no idea of how to run abyssals properly) I had 200k isk left after replacing it. If I hadn't lost a Caracal I would be at about 65mil net assets over the 5 hour period of playing.

I am looking for a new Corp to run with. I left and came back.  Corp is not online anymore. I got a lot of skills trained and even more in liquid. I just need to get into the action and learn some PCP and get more effective at wormhole ratting. Get back into gas cloud mining and stuff
---
Corp is American, my irl friends are in it. Ctas are like 90% XiX guys who are Russian however
---
You can't go wrong finding an out of the way place to mine and just collecting isk that way, taking breaks and doing some combat sites + escalations/anoms for high potential isk. 
---
There's always PI as well, and if you want more excitement level 4 combat missions aren't awful. If you do it right, you can make more isk than you think would be possible in highsec.
---
Idk about Brave, but 501(c)(7) is for recreational and social clubs. You're not a business, you're just a bunch of people pitching in to pay for your pool hall/model aircraft club/gaming clan/bridge night.

So you organize that way, and you're allowed to have a bank account and a treasurer and all that without paying tax on the money your members toss in.

Currently Skilling into a mining covetor for when we do our weekly moon mining, and I've been trying to do some pi already. Haven't thought of the missions though, my friend tells me they're a waste of time.

I'm not sure what's worse about all of that. So it sounds like you're saying that you think eve is dieing. Especially when compared to a nothing game like albion.

---
I kinda agree with this.
---
EVE has so many different options for you to choose from such as 
---
* Staying in High Sec - Tends to be great for new players.
---
* Joining a corp like Karmafleet, Brave or Horde (they will be very good for you as a new player and any of those corps will be fun to fly in)
---
* Low Sec - You can do OK in lowsec, but you will die alot. Don't rage quit if that keeps happening. Learn from the experience, talk to the guy who killed you. Some will be dicks, others will help.
---
* Wormholes - Again, great fun to explore Wormholes in an Astero. You'll get some 1v1's. Generally a fun experience.
---
Just don't quit because you die. It happens... This isn't World of Warcraft, don't be afraid to lose you shit.
---
Ur a loser
---
Solitude is named solitude for a reason
---
Ain't nothing in this game that has zero risk, pal. I don't think you understand much about Eve.

You expect solo players to be 100% safe doing the most profitable activities in the game? Get real.

SOME DUMB FUCK TEST GUYS ROLLED THROUGH THE HIGHSEC MY HOME HOLE WAS LINKED TO WHILE ON THE WAY TO STRUCTURE BASH IN HIGHSEC...YOU KNOW, THEIR USUAL USTZ STUFF. WELL SOME OF THE FEROX'S WERE SUSPECT, SO NATURALLY I CHASED SHOT AND KILLED ONE OF THE BASTARDS WITH A THORAX. I WENT TO TRY AND FIND MORE BUT I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY WENT.
---
POINT IS, IT TOOK ME LIKE 5 FULL MINUTES TO KILL THE FUCKER AND NONE OF YOU DUDES WERE WILLING TO TURN AROUND AND TOSS THE FUCKER SOME LOGI? WAS YOUR STRUCTURE BASH SO IMPORTANT? IRONY IS, I WAS ON MY WAY TO BUY AMMO TO BASH A POCO IN MY OWN HOLE BUT THANKS TO YOU I DIDN'T EVEN NEED TO BUY ANYTHING.

It's not an old code thing. It's an efficiency thing.
---
Updating when a user looks at it is efficient, because it doesnt do anything without a user looking at it. 
---
It's also simple calculation to get from original state to current state. So you can simulate it in code.

Why can't CCP compile their own killboard? Screw the delays and make it all public. Intel should be made available asap with all kills.

Damn .01 ISK bots leaking onto my christian subreddit

If you really were who you claim to be, you would know that for any given problem, number of dimensions of the input increases complexity, hence makes it harder to process, regardless of the problem type.   
---
Easy to make a tetris bot, harder to make a probe scanner bot. Can you guess why? I have my doubts.  
---
One last thing, maybe go look at a mirror and try to ask yourself what are you doing with your life. Randomly insulting people is a sign of mental issue. Seek help.
---
&gt; elling new players to rat in null sec is by far the dumbest thing anyone can do

Did he edit? I thought he was saying do incursions in empire and make nullsec levels of isk.

Nobody cares about your stupid clan or your stupid logo lol

asking nicely to post dank leaks on reddit, just grow a pair. Age of chaos.

WHOEVER TOLD ME BRAVE DOESN'T BLOB WAS A DIRTY LIAR! SURE IT WAS STILL A GREAT FIGHT AND I EXPECTED TO LOSE THE SHIP - STILL NO EXCUSE TO STOP FEEDING ME TASTY ASSFRIGS!
---
&gt; The issue is the information contained in it. Why do you own it? If you got less of it, would you be good with that?
---
Because I killed you for it, why should I get less information exactly?
---
&gt; Do you understand that not playing isnt a solution?
---
Oh it's a solution, just one you don't like to your non problem.
---
When zkill was just evekill and most alliances and corps had their own killboards I rarely heard "check evekill for activity in the region today." Granted this was 5+ years ago at least if not more. Different times.
---
People still play this shitty mobile game?
---
Hilariously bad from GOTB but is anyone surprised at this point.

4% bonus to resists

what a great way of ccp showing they dont care about lowsec by literally deleting it
---
&gt;Because I killed you for it, why should I get less information exactly?
---
Because its not yours and free intel is a problem.
---
&gt;Oh it's a solution, just one you don't like to your non problem.
---
You think its not a problem. I know it is a problem. So the problem is with you here.
---
lol its the world of tanks of dungeon grinders. So not only nerds. But really gullible ones with loose wallets.

Back at you bro.  Get some help.

Copyright is automatic.  Registering it just makes it easier to fight and makes it possible to to claim attorneys fees and statutory damages.

It was not supposed to be, though
---
I'm in both this group's discord and a discord full of brave founders. Funny that they don't seem to have any common members?
---
I love it.  Give new players even less chance to grow.
---
Old players who got bored of hisec and rich enough to not care want to grief that’s cool.
---
But what is the obsession with wanting to make it harder on new players to try and grow?  When i started eve you didn’t get killed constantly in hisec with &gt;500m cargo.  I warn friends who play to get out of hisec asap and have to explain how useless the police are
---
&gt; Because its not yours
---
Yes, it is.
---
You think its a problem. I know its not a problem. So the problem is with you here.
---
Try faction warfare in low sec you can use T1 frigates and destroyers and you will make a load of ISK to support your pvp from the LP you will get awarded. I suggest that RvB might be the corp for you they take lots of newbros are happy to explain all the things and don't expect you to fly the latest expensive null doctri.
---
maybe fix the broken shit before breaking other shit.
---
Who cares?
---
&gt;Please return the instant free-intel for my playstyle, but not others' tia
---
This game is losing anal virginity level experience mate. Come join us :D
---
I get the feeling chaos is synonymous with 'getting people to go and play other games'
---
All we've seen are declining log in numbers, even after the massage of free sp, and a slew of shitty ideas from armchair idiots suggesting making the game more tedious and obtuse.
---
How about instead of the age of chaos, we could have the age of fun and enjoyment?
---
Maybe they are just on alts ;)
---
\+1 for exploration, I'm shit at eve and the first time i really got into it was exploration. going through worm holes looking for sites is like playing the slots, never know what you'll get. You can also pop out into nullsec if you want
---
That just sounds like you have awful logistics, new corp?
---
As a long time Brave nublet and recent Albion player, I really hoped it was a real Brave offshoot... I would have joined in a second.
---
I dunno, I thought "Vulture" was an appropriate name for a ship so clearly scavenged from another game.
---
You have TEST and Brave just next door, why not just move over?
---
Honestly, not a bad idea. I'm comfortable in my own corp, and I have no idea what life would be like in test. It's supposedly super opsec there, and I suppose there's less of a safety net there for me to really feel comforable making mistakes there
---
I don't disagree with you. At the same time a killboard is a staple of EVE. Delayed killmails imo is the best way to meet half way.
---
Yeah its good but as a counter point: suicide ganking HS should really be more popular. Sure the starter fits are cheap but some people fly officer-fit vindicators, leshaks, and nightmares.
---
If people suicide gank mining barges or haulers in HS for a profit then I don't know why people don't interfere with incursions.
---
Warp into someone else's site and pop the wave trigger, tackle whoever is taking the room's aggro (the highest dps so probably one of the blingy ones) and let the npcs melt them.
---
Even one officer mod dropping would turn a profit on a small fleet?
---
NPSi fleets are usually fleets and not small gang though
---
Haha
---
TEST can be as casual as you want. 
---
&gt; It's supposedly super opsec there,
---
No idea what you mean by that
---
&gt; I suppose there's less of a safety net there for me to really feel comforable making mistakes there
---
What sort of mistakes are you worried about?
---
Look for corps based in lowsec and faction warfare, it's usually the best place for solo and small gang pvp.
---
Good luck. Local has been borked for over a week now.
---
The best solution is to take into account the wishes of both players by introducing limited killmails. Various arguments can be made regarding the ownership of the info in a killmail, but ultimately the conclusion must be that both players have a claim and a compromise that isnt the least restrictive (complete killmails) must be reached.
---
" Agreement has to be logged "  
---
You agreed to the EULA when you installed and played the game. Did you even read the notices on the screen when installing the game or did you just keep clicking yes till it installed like every other wanna be lawyer like gamer?
---
Goons premier crab at it again crying on the forums about how delve deserves near total security with flase equivalents.
---
HAVENT BEEN ABLE TO DO THE THINGS YOU ENJOY BECAUSE OF BLACKOUT? 
---
SOUNDS LIKE YOURE JUST A SOFT-ASS AFRAID OF GETTING JUMPED
---
Not what peeps have told me from the API team have said. its more how PI was originally coded that even on their side nothing is updated till someone actually goes to the planet.
---
Well I've lost plenty of ratting ships, and I'm more comfortable spending the last of my isk on some ship/books/etc. because i know that if I end up without any options I have people that would loan me.
---
Also I've asked if I can be on test comms so I can salvage their wrecks in a Sunesis, response pending
---
That's not really smuggling though, that's literally just a normal null sec delivery service. 
---
If you have docking rights to make a delivery then they won't be shooting you, will they? This will also be done by cyno jump, so it's not like you are ever really putting your ship in danger unless you make a serious mistake. Jump from one safe spot to another safe spot to a station an you are done. Not exactly dangerous, literally just a normal every day delivery in null. 
---
This game would be so much better without cyno jumping.
---
That's exactly what I'm saying.
---
The numbers for null sec ratting are as a comparison vs what most people tell newbies to do within 1 day of signing up.
---
That guy just read what he needed to read to be able to be salty, not actually reading what I said

Small one, it's usually easier to just roll one of our statics and try again, than roll a highsec static further down the chain.
---
I dunno about shield procs I've always been a brick tank fan but glad ya'll had fun regardless
---
Why roll when you can just sort logistics out
---
The idea of doing that for a made-up video game corporation's logo makes me happy.
---
Year, not week.
---
but, but but, but what if this scammer messes up and I get to scam him instead!!!!
---
I don’t see any logo and honestly don’t see why you care?
---
&gt;Well I've lost plenty of ratting ships,
---
Thats why we have a standing fleet
---
I'm more comfortable spending the last of my isk on some ship/books/etc. 
---
We have TEST_Free that gives out free basic ships and skillbooks upon request
---

---
It startes with NPC moving cities... It ends with player owned moving citadels!
---
Literally no one else in the game has been more successful at causing goon dmg than Olmeca and Marshy the past 2 years. 
---
Only spod brained idiots think you know jack shit about what it takes to get kills in delve. All you know how to do is put a titan in fleet.
---
Prove to me the moon landing actually happened.  I dare you.
---
Are there more 0.1 systems that would become null, or 0.5 systems that would become lowsec?
---
Totally not QRF. We need offense here to keep it real.
---
Because Aridia and Solitude are so far away from usefulness, that it's not worth the effort. It's easier to roll away from them and get a new hole closer to where you need it.
---
Yeah they hurt risk adverse gatecampers and folks that only gank newbies.
---
We'd have to remove Rorqs, super cap umbrellas, and everything that makes krabs happy in null.  Which would hurt numbers more.  TLDR: Your idea sucks.
---
Can someone explain how zkill helps them for pvp? I understand it you want to see what someone usually flys with fits but what else? How does delay stop that?
---
I'll trade my sanity for a missed deal any day of the week
---
Good to know, may I suggest Flycatcher?
---
I mean die to rats xd.
---
Will seriously consider it, I will ask around to see if I can stay in gemico/rzr comms so I can salvage. Who should I talk to in game so I can work something out?
---
4.999.999.00
---
:P
---
It is not. Most of the info doesn't come from you, so your claim is weak, which is why you have no arguments.
---
Far, far, far, far less than the number of people who look at the map and go to the glowing dots
---
Ah so they do. Don’t fight a lot of Hels in my Keres. Funny enough, he still stuck around for probably 10-15 minutes while we killed off his fighters.
---
For shield resists - yes, fit assault missiles , proper rigs and you can one shot most of the frigates doing around 700 dps at &lt;35km range.   
---
AB fit of course.

Can null sites be worth the same amount as wormhole sites with accordance to truesec?  :).
---
Oh shit, thats us. HELLO EVE! \*waves\* how is this game doin?
---
Not really - intel was pretty much - "they are likely to be around here" or "they usually rat / mine here - if we poke them they will come" or "there is usually a camp there" 
---
The game was better for it, less risk adverse cherry picking, more proper fighting.
---
IM STILL BANNED FROM THAT fuckers. im also band on Albion-Sub :'(
---
Don't you dare challenge Snuff.  Ever.  
---
Also, shouldn't you be busy mining in hisec since you're a filthy carebear now?
---
Go omega immediately, these people telling you to stay alpha are just plain wrong
---
You train skills at 1/2 speed and can’t fly t2 ships as an alpha which removes most of the fun from the game. 
---
I’d recommend finding a Corp that lives in a lower class wh, maybe c2/3 unless you already have capital skills in which case move into a c5 and start building. You can run 4-5 sites in a c5 with a dreadnought and pay your sub for the month if you’d rather not pay real money for eve, you also get to kick the shit out of failing groups like hole control when you live in high class whs :) 
---
maybe look up spoopy newbies, bunch of awesome guys to fly with and you’ll be laughing 24/7 in their comms while they teach you how to play. 
---
Fly safe and praise bob o7
---
That is correct, but they also hurt other groups because of the general risk averseness made possible as a result of free intel.
---
Your friends don't know shit then, blitzing L4s in HS has a really good isk/hr ratio (for HS), probably better than VNI/Myrm/etc drone ratting in anoms. Can't tell you exactly how much because I haven't done a mission in more than 6 years, but it's pretty good and safe to do.
---
For everything you say, I would give exploration a try while you get better combat skills (both for PVP and PVE), it's good isk and you'll learn a lot about mechanics.
---
And I've read what you said about your corp, but it really doesn't sound like you are having fun there. Real friends won't stop being friends with you because you change corps mate. Just find a good place for you right now.
---
Yes, it would definitely suck to have a fun and enjoyable game.
---
there are lots of 0.5 were people rat and have assets that would be nice to see
---
lots of LowPower Structures bashed

---

---
lol rat in a domi and you can get a fax/titan dropped on you for a save
---
&gt;I will ask around to see if I can stay in gemico/rzr comms so I can salvage
---
You can follow  a supercarrier around and salvage after them but explo is much more worth it 100mil in a single site isnt unheard of.
---
&gt;Who should I talk to in game so I can work something out?
---
Decide which TEST corp you want to join and jump into thier ingame/discord channel. 
---
Dreddit is obviously the behemoth corp in TEST but Brand Newbros might also be a good fit for you.
---

---
I find chaos pretty fun and enjoyable.
---
And it would be even better if CCP decided to extend it to LS in any way. They should first realize that LS actually exists ofc, but hey, theres always hope!
---
Only when you really need a Jita connection.
---
When you're trying to keep control then inevitably every hisec exit is 2 jumps from Amarr.
---
Im missing you guys too &lt;3
---
It looks a lot like the Drake fit that I used to use for C3 sites. So seems plausible. Usually you want the two resist mods to be rat-specific by IIRC the Sleepers do omni-damage so maybe you want invulns instead.
---
Like your terrible reddit posts, the spod must flow.
---
That wasn't random. I insulted back. I guess even a simple argument is too "complex" for you. Must be some shitty university to let people like you run around claiming to be computer scientist.
---
if the value of the gank fleet required to gank you is less than half of the value of your cargo it's no longer a question of if you will be ganked but how long until you are ganked.
---
TL:DR don't fly untanked haulers.
---
&gt; It is not.
---
It is.
---
&gt; Most of the info doesn't come from you, so your claim is weak, which is why you have no arguments.
---
It all comes from me, I killed you for it.
---
So freedom of speech is not an ideal to strive for in the world?         
---
You are an authoritarian idiot.
---
Fair point but they aren't always. I've definitely been in some smaller hot drop fleets in Bombers Bar and a few small roams with Spectre before. 
---
If he's wanting jump in to get some experience with it there aren't a ton of options without joining a corp. Which is a perfectly fine option as well.
---
Ye, we stole it as a joke and we are sorry as well as in talks with with Brave itself
---
that shitty mobile game is how this sub got rid of me! :D
---
The problem is 20 T1 catalysts can take out a surprisingly wide range of targets.  At 2m each (40m total), anybody with 80m in cargo (*or mods*) is a +EV gank.

There was a misunderstanding and a mistake on our part, we are speaking with Dunk, the logo has been removed and we are discussing things with Dunk about the rest. It doesn't change that our inspiration was from what Brave did for EVE online and what we are trying do in Albion. Please do not go after the newbies if you need somewhere to stick the pitchforks then the buck stops with me 110%.

Maybe only do the delay for nullsec systems.

The best part of Eve is the sperg in Jita. It doesn't surprise me that the redditf4gs get their female balls twisted when anyone brings it up. Maybe your wife's boyfriend can block all the words you are too afraid to read.

How does one set up a good courier contract scam?  Is that all but dead these days now that locking out of citadels is no longer a thing?
---
Man these videos are so dope. They literally inspire me to go out and try the same (be it in a smaller scale).
---
Only question is why do you still have the tishu logo at the start?
---
uhh i heard! :D no local in null right?
---
Also a great way of showing they do not care about any highsec group that stayed active enough after citadels to deploy moon Athanors
---
eve isnt for me anymore. i exchanged lasers for fireball. still doing thermal dmg tho eyyyy
---
Yes? Because that's efficient.
---
Constant updates are inefficient, because the vast majority of the time, a player isn't going to care. So you have massively increased load, without any benefit.
---
My portable gallows is available for renting.
---
Creditcarding as a weekend warrior is a sensible way to play the game.

Praise be to Lord James.

Aye - it's made everything better in null even if it wasn't a panacea.
---
Yes it is OD.  
---
Put down the Final Fantasy and come back home.
---
Eve is dying?
---
Not mine, you would not kill me, but your victim put that information in space, you did not. Your ownership of it does not exist, therefore you shouldnt have it.
---
comeon, blackout is fun
---
Why would anyone blame the newbies for what you did? You aren't s martyr
---
That's why people unironically say remove low class wormholes

Hell, even some of the high class pvp corps are risk adverse as fuck

 Hunnid thousand on my head, it's disrespect (disrespect)   
---
&gt; So offended that I had to double check
---
Do rigs installed in a structure affect the amount of salvage that structure generates once being salvaged after it dies? For example, can you make more ISK from salvaging a Raitaru with tech 2 rigs?
---
How many did you get? Rats don't count
---
My guess

---
Smuggling exists, just not in the traditional sense. 
---
In a nut shell, the smuggling that exists in Eve is blockade running. You're basically transporting items through gate camps or "dangerous" space. The legality of the items isn't really a thing unless you are worried about faction standing.
---
There are a lot of goods that come from nullsec and lowsec that are bought cheaply and sold at a high mark up in highsec. The problem is in transporting those items to the markets but this is where you come in as a "smuggler." Those lowsec systems sometimes have gate camps on the route to highsec. 
---
Examples:
---
Frulegur (metro region, lowsec system that is a choke point from lowsec/null sec suppliers to highsec markets. 
---
Tama (its a fun testing field of smuggling skills.)
---
Rancer (shortest route from Jita to Hek but its through a lowsec pipe that is usually camped)
---
Check out some info below:
---
T1 Industrials
---
The first hauling ships a player can use are Tech 1 industrial ships. These are relatively cheap and fast, and can haul a moderate amount of cargo. They are however also very fragile and can be destroyed by just one ganker if the cargo they carry is valuable enough. These ships can be sorted into three different classes:
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Hauling#T1_Industrials
---
Check out this part : Fast transports, which are used to move low-volume, high-value goods quickly and safely.
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Industrial
---
For example, the Wreathe (Minmatar fast transport) can be fit to align in as little as 4 seconds while having 22k EHP, but would only have a cargo capacity of up to 4,622 m3. On the opposite end of the spectrum, a Bestower (Amarr bulk transport) can be fit to carry up to 39k m3 but will take at least 13 seconds to align and have less than 8k EHP. To that end, fast transports can be fit to transport material through lowsec relatively safely, whereas bulk transports should be restricted to systems known to be safe unless accompanied by an escort, e.g. an OOC alt.

Believing freedom of speech is ideal in human society makes you fool. But u have to learn it on your own skin, maybe go outside sometimes and check ur freedome on random peron, come back and tell us how long will be you recovery time in hospital :D
---
Aye, good comment.
---
Im not talking about your wants and opinions.
---
It is the fact that you did not put this info space, most of the info on the KM is not from you, and you would never have complete info because some data is lost when the modules are destroyed.
---
Nice work!
---
Not the same thing. GDPR is very specific that way.

Doesn’t matter where. Group size has no limit right now because large groups have all the technology to make control scale.

This would cut off overland travel between Amarr, Jita, Dodixie, and Rens, given that the routes between all of these have a 0.5 in them. Hope you got a jump freighter!

Hella fun to play. Dev's have made some great changes and have grown the game. I cancelled my 9 eve accounts and havent looked back. I get full loot pvp on demand in Albion. Eve can't even come close to providing that anymore.

I got top damage on all 3. #nerfkikiwhen?

What compromise is there to make? Killmails are already limited. You get full information on the destroyed ship and its modules, and only the shiptype/weapon system of the attacker.

---
We update it when humans are going to look at it because humans can't do maths in their heads super fast. When computers are looking at it, it makes way more sense to have the downstream consumer calculate the current state using the last calculated state and extrapolating.
---
If we run a planet update every time someone hit the PI endpoint we'd have made a DDOS button, people could hit the endpoint with lots of characters at once to generate lag spikes no matter how long the cache was.

Now that they have a umbrella of their own they have to follow goon tradition.

Look you're in a supposedly knowledgeable corp that's all about helping you, so why don't you pose this concern you have to them and let them help you.
---
I'll tell you a little secret. You're not the only newbie in this game. There are plenty of new players in this game. And plenty of them are having a blast and making isk just fine. And plenty of them aren't. The difference most likely is the attitude that each has.
---
There are ways to make decent isk even for newbies. Your knowledgeable and helpful corp mates should be able to help you and direct you to those ways. If they aren't then they're not as knowledgeable or as helpful as you say they are and you need to take your IRL friends and leave them for another corp that is.

AAR: We scouted a Horde Hel gating, we were already formed going for after some rorqs So we bridged into 9P40 jumped into 1S- and started clearing horde subcaps and kept the hel Tackled. 
---
We dropped inhibs on the Hel So Horde lit a cyno 60km off, an Avatar, Hel and 2 Apostles Jumped into save him the Avatar Lanced at our lokis and we just moved Slightly to the left and he missed and he Melted the tackled Hel for us. He also killed a Horde Apostle with his DD

The Hel was left in hull after the Lance and we finished it off.

Dino side:

I forget what I was doing exactly, but I was looking at the Esoteria killboard and saw the Stratios kill. Seeing the PL ticker is like catnip for me, you know, because I want to kill you guys as much as possible. Then I see someone report a snigg gang in Intel on a Rorqual. I jump in an interceptor and hit the jump bridge and I can't figure out where the Rorqual is. Finally found him and that was me that warped in on you guys at 100. I turn around and while trying to type in intel your Malediction gets a long point on me. I burn away. We saw that you guys had a small gang and weren't really a threat, so instead of dropping HAWs and scare you off without a fight, we just bridge in some subs. Didn't matter, you warped off anyways. We spread out looking for you, and I did find some of your ecm drones in X-H I think, but that was it. Didn't hear another thing about you until just now.

I would have helped him regardless of what he did. It being PL is just icing on the cake. We were ready to jump and we had subs right next door. It would have been a massacre if he had let us know.

at least do some shitposts .-.

I also have torches as well!
---
&gt;What compromise is there to make?
---
Allow players to choose if they want full or limited killmails. In the case of the latter, name of victim, specific ship type, and destroyed modules are no longer shown. This might be enough to resolve the free intel issue in that players would not be searchable, and the fit is protected unless every module drops.
---
&gt;Killmails are already limited. You get full information on the destroyed ship and its modules, and only the shiptype/weapon system of the attacker.
---
Even destroyed modules are shown despite those modules not being lootable. The game actually adds information.
---
Is there an argument that a killmail should also contain information on ships that were not "killed" for a KM to be not limited in your view?
---
"Now for my next trick, I'm going to zap the Loki right off the top of the Hels' captain's bridge."

It really shouldn't be this hard a concept to grasp.

Ok explain to me how removing infinite spawning anoms will hurt solo players harder than blocs?

actually he was ratting.....apparently...

and the titan got scared when it saw the red blob....and hit the hel...
---
and murdered the Hel's fax....
---
Roguer Drone sites then.
---
That's a surprisingly good point, the Nestor (low mass wormholy armor logi ship) doesn't have a shield counterpart.

We have enough ships and balanced is fucked enough as it is.

this really is the truth. the blackout may hurt bots but not as much as it hurts normal players who cant devote 24 hours of the day to farming isk where they recover there loses much easier.

Pls stop
---
Others can post it, but when we are hunting we make sure nobody is posting their kills till after, so we do not give away our positions and activities.  If our scouts get spotted or we have a bait ship, we don’t want our enemies to know our numbers and ships we are flying.  It doesn’t make sense in a lore capacity and third party apps that compromise my position should be frowned upon.  Doesn’t really matter to me anyways because I won eve already.
---
Are we posting single super kills on reddit again?
---
Setting aside the titan - which looks awesome, but hasn't been made yet - the Angel Cartel has five frigates and a cruiser *already in the game* that players have been begging to use for years: the [Devourer](https://www.eveonlineships.com/eve-ship-database.php?es=Devourer&amp;ids=613) (what the Daredevil was based on), [Fury](https://www.eveonlineships.com/eve-ship-database.php?es=Fury&amp;ids=614), [Lynx](https://www.eveonlineships.com/eve-ship-database.php?es=Lynx&amp;ids=618), [Medusa](https://www.eveonlineships.com/eve-ship-database.php?es=Medusa&amp;ids=616), [Swordspine](https://www.eveonlineships.com/eve-ship-database.php?es=Swordspine&amp;ids=619), and Ixion. None of them are published and the Ixion can't even be datamined for some reason, though you can see what it looks like by entering its ShipID (636) on the image server [link](https://image.eveonline.com/Render/636_512.png). The frigates also require the Jove Frigate skill to fly them, with the Devourer and Swordspine needing you to reach level 4! It probably goes without saying that unless CCP introduces a storyline which gives us access to whatever source of Jove tech the Angels found ([Heaven station](https://www.eveonlineships.com/eve-ship-database.php?es=Heaven&amp;ids=9867)), we're not going to be using these any time soon.
---
What's weird is that their ShipIDs - you can see them in the URLs - are all in the low 600s, which appears to indicate that they've been in the game since launch! I even found the [Dramiel](https://image.eveonline.com/Render/612_512.png) and [Cynabal](https://image.eveonline.com/Render/637_512.png) in the same area, which is kinda weird since the player-usable [Dramiel](https://www.eveonlineships.com/eve-ship-database.php?es=Dramiel&amp;ids=17932) and [Cynabal](https://www.eveonlineships.com/eve-ship-database.php?es=Cynabal&amp;ids=17720) have ShipIDs indicating they were added way, *way* later in the game's development, whilst the IDs for the [Echo](https://www.eveonlineships.com/eve-ship-database.php?es=Echo&amp;ids=617) and [Immolator](https://www.eveonlineships.com/eve-ship-database.php?es=Immolator&amp;ids=615) are in the same sequence of Angel frigate IDs. Apparently that's because [the Immolator used to be an Angel frigate called the Styx](https://westhorpe.net/2011/11/mysteries-of-new-eden-the-pirate-ships/) (and the Echo was originally an *assault frigate*), but it doesn't explain why CCP needed to make entirely new versions for players to fly. Maybe they still plan to let us use the original Jove-derived Angel ship designs, who knows?
---
Yes, but only if you don't include any information about the kill. Zkill links only.
---
How come no one seems to do combat sites that you scan down? Exploring nullsec is a whole bunch of combat sigs, some multiple days old.

Did I ever say anything to that extent? Wow bro. Read.
---
Should try it bud. Can be totally self sufficient with very little effort. The solo pvp is fun and the group pvp is a blast. There is no asset safety in pure pvp zones. Pick up the good shit off every kill. Burn motherfuckers shit to the ground and put up your own shit.
---
Its actually a better PVP game than EVE tbh. Actually its a better PVE game than EVE too.
---
The community is toxic but doesnt hold a candle to EVEs toxicity. So I guess EVE is better there.
---
And the salt mines are rich.
---
Great game. Honestly...and imo...better than EVE is in its current state.
---
the fuck are you talking about?

There will always be something broken. So you basically just asked for nothing new ever.

---
Moracha?
---
This no way hinders new players at all. One region per month and then back to normal? It's called creating content.
---
well, also forgot the apostle alt. should have included that in the vid as well.

Its actually come a long way since release. Its actually really enjoyable to play now. PVP atm is in a way better place than EVE.

You keep talking about "personal data" ESI does not give out your personal data it gives out your in-game character data that is not personal data.

I know in kf you have access to all kinds of sigs and squads for specialized stuff like smallgang blopsing or wh stuff, hell you can fc a fleet day one. People just see mindless monkeys in big groups and assume that is wahat big groups make people into, when it is just that a big group let's people do that better than a small group, more enabling it then enforcing it. If you want to do stuff you can, if you don't you don't have to.

Otherwise, why? EVE players show solidarity with each other.

Not random people over the world. Are you gonna hold a cyno vigil daily?
---
It does matter. And its fundamental to how the game works. Smaller shit loses to bigger shit. Small groups lose out to bigger groups. Bigger groups take almost no damage from smaller groups these days. We need to reverse that not double down on it.

The key thing is that he's not doing this for the victims, he's doing it for himself. It's classic virtue signalling. If he wanted things to change he'd spend his time working to make change, and not making a giant fucking song and dance about how good of a person he claims he is.

As someone pondering to come back after half a decade I wonder how anyone calls that cheap. Back then a month worth of playtime cost like a third. Eve inflation is crazy.

I’m selling mine for only 30000000.00

I don't like people who morally grandstand on other people's grief. If you want change, make it. Don't do this thinly-veiled song and dance about how good of a person you think you are.
---
No I’m not - tell you what I’ll make a completely clean alt in an npc corp.  you’re such trash.  Can’t even show respect.
---
Well yes but the main feature of zkill actually isn't the kill feed. It's the query; you can see kill history for specific ships or people, and you can see reports of who or what's most frequent where.
---
This is completely the last straw with you.  You’re literal garbage.  I have no self interest in this at all.
---
You do not own that info because you did not provide it. Whoever brought it has far more claim to ownership than you.
---
Are you planning on holding a vigil for the 1600 people who died of cancer today? Or the 450 people who died in accidents? Quit standing on graves for attention and Reddit karma.
---
Then don’t fucking come douche anchor
---
Sweet virtue signal bruh. Make sure to post to twitter/facebook/your mom's fridge for max updoots.
---
I wish I could stomach the kool-aide you fecal-brained idiotas consume  that makes you post stupid shit like this.
---
so with all the mass shootings happening in the US - how many vigils are you planning to hold?
---
Aww your alt has spoken
---
You'd have to cyno out... how difficult is that?
---
Would be more beautiful if it was number of murders commited per day and it ended at zero or number of saying nice things to others and it ended at infinity yet here we are, completely unrelated to any of these things.
---
lol never not boson the ball of drones, hell with actual enemy ships
---
That remains to be seen. We don’t know what will be classified as personal in the years to come or what the new laws will be used for and iterated on. There’s a reason why chat logs are written to the disk and not the cloud. Yet alliances run tools that watch log files and send them to their cloud. There is plenty of personal data in the game and CCP has no word in what is is classified as.
---
&gt; You do not own that info because you did not provide it. 
---
I don't need to provide it, I killed you for it.
---
&gt; Whoever brought it has far more claim to ownership than you.
---
Nope, you did, until I killed you and took it.

Can't believe nobody has remarked what a hel of a lance that was.

---
You'd have to cyno out. How difficult is that? I'm sure you do that already.  Am I right? What's wrong here? You just don't understand new content can be fun? Not everything in this game is for everyone.
---
bro link ur SoundCloud at least shit...
---
I have one too! But to be fair I think it is because I installed eve back in 2004 and have pretty much just moved the folder from drive to drive for the past 15 years. I also have some other cool files listed below.
---
:\\EVE\\repair.exe
---
:\\Eve\\LogServer.exe
---
:\\Eve\\eve.exe (Safe Mode)
---
:\\Eve\\code.ccp
---
I also have all the old DX9 stuff in the folder from 2014.
---
Na, before they changed over to this ostensibly easier to maintain chat back end it's been fucked to varying degrees off and on. It was legit rock solid prior to that change, almost never even glitched.
---
No this is my main account, and based on your response you don't actually give a shit about anyone but yourself.
---
Since this is the first one that’s happened since I’ve started playing idk.  Why such hate?
---
Coding reasons too.
---
Knowing CCP they'll be like "look at the usage metrics everyone uses ACs they're fine"
---
Horde is a helpful bunch of people, but helping Goons kill a Horde Hel might be overdoing it a little bit.
---
How do you even draw that asinine conclusion
---
That's my choice for solo null PvP roaming. It's actually very popular. However, there's a lot more to this game and each aspect I use the appropriate ship. God you're dumb.
---
&gt;Allow players to choose if they want full or limited killmails. In the case of the latter, name of victim, specific ship type, and destroyed modules are no longer shown. This might be enough to resolve the free intel issue in that players would not be searchable, and the fit is protected unless every module drops.

This is not free intel, someone put forth the effort to kill the ship in question to learn about it. Then, one of the pilots involved made the conscious **choice** to share that with others by uploading it to zkillboard, having an ESI Token do it, or joining a Corp that does so.
---
The victor doesn't need your consent to blast your ship to scrap, why should the nature of your ship remain secret after its remains are scattered around the local gravity well?
---
&gt;Even destroyed modules are shown despite those modules not being lootable. The game actually adds information.
---
1. I don't see the problem. Again, the victor **earned** this intel.
---
2. The game isn't adding information, those modules were there the whole time. The fact that they were destroyed is tangential. I mean, unless you are unironically saying that anything destroyed should be vaporized in such a manner that no method of forensic science known to man now, or in the future, would be able to tell what kind of module was plugged in to slot #4.
---
&gt;Is there an argument that a killmail should also contain information on ships that were not "killed" for a KM to be not limited in your view?
---
Well, "full" implies all details, so that would seem to imply that the killmail would encompass full knowledge of the victorious vessel as well. 
---
Just because the killmail is not "limited" *in the way you want it to be* does not mean it isn't.
---
Now, if you want to talk about limiting uninvolved parties' access to the details of the killmail, that's a different discussion. 
---
Easily gamed and worked around, like most solutions that rely on players behaving in a particular way, but it's somewhere closer to an appropriate solution.
---
[I'll just leave this here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mass_shootings_in_the_United_States_in_2019)
---
Molten Intel is still a thing amazingly.
---
I check every time I come back to EVE
---
Email them what? To stop FF'ing the citizenry into giving up the only thing that is keeping them from turning the US in SA? That would be counter-productive to the ZoG agenda, and conveniently, ignored. 
---
Wait...you probably meant that you want gun-confiscation...Maybe you can join the March Against Whiteness? Be part of the solution, fam.
---
Google.
---
Yes, pretty standard cause they cycle faster then the big ones and if you have small ones you want burst boosts of energy more then anything
---
I'm showing far more respect for the dead than you, my dude.
---
Solidarity...
---
that's a red term you're using there, comrade...
---
&gt;I don't need to provide it, I killed you for it.
---
No, you died and too much info was shared with whoever killed you, but that is not the owner. We know this because we know where it came from.
---
Tax and industry are not mandatory &amp; tedious activities specific to alliance upkeep.  
---
If pvp isn't your cup of tea, one might say it is tedious. Still most big bloc level alliances don't gang press their linemembers into defensive fleets, i'd argue most linemembers show up for the sake of the pvp and having fun.  Thus it's neither tedious nor mandatory.
---
What does it mean to "meta the guns"?
---
I am speaking of the fact that there are many small groups maintaining Athanors in 0.5 systems, which would suddenly become lowsec systems and available for capitals too shoot at, with also a lot of added risk for the mining operations.
---
No, actually, there aren't. Uedama, Niarja and about seven systems between Dodixie and Rens are galactic choke points. But, hey, don't take my word for it. Feel free to link a route between any of those four systems with only 0.6s or better.
---
I’m so glad you spend time trying To shit on people wanting to do anything.  But there ya go.  The eve community at its absolute finest.  I’m not gonna go thru that list and parse it because yeah one victim is too many.  
---
Whatever.  You people are sad.  If I had lost a loved one who played this game and someone wanted to show some element of humanity and support I’d be respectful.  
---
I don’t want a damn thing for this.  Good lord.
---
AC buffs and minnie hull nerfs pls. They OP
---
Because you're virtue signaling on the EVE sub-Reddit for karma
---
I doubt Brave Newbies in EVE is the first "Brave Newbies" guild in the history of gaming, so the name.. eh. The artwork though? Oof.
---
I think if I was a new player now... I wouldn't keep playing... which omg... eve only has a 4% retention rate now... what a shocker....
---
After this you’re blocked so fuck off
---
Yeah, that went well for him. XD
---
But you can't prove that any of them played this game. What everyone is saying is that if an EVE player died then we'd be all over.
---
I’m not on other social media.  So sorry to have offended you.
---
Lol
---
CCP THE CHAT IS FUCKED UP FOR 1 WEEK NOW.
---
YOU ARE HIDING BAD METRICS BEHIND LOGGING REWARDS
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UDeZ-H8QOU
---
Sure
---
Why can’t things be for good reasons?  Why is it assumed to be a karma whoring?  This is why this community is so toxic because even good natured posts can’t be appreciated.  
---
Don’t upvote it.  Idgaf.  I’m just saying out of respect for any victims I’m planning on a vigil.  It’s no different than any other vigil literally anywhere for any cause any where.
---
Yup... gotta love Eve! Oh, and how different is that from wars now?
---
Quite talking to yourself.
---
FUCK YOU CCP.
---
BECAUSE OF BLACKOUT NEW PLAYERS HAVE NO CHACE IN 0.0 WITHOUT CONSTANT HELP FROM OLDER VETS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE TARGET OF 'ELITE' PVPERS WHO COULD NOT FIGHT THEIR WAY OUT OF A PAPER BAG,
---
YOU REALLY HATE NEW PLAYERS CCP
---
Use meta 1-4 instead of T2. In this case, 650mm Medium 'Scout' Artillery I, probably. Better than 650mm Artillery Cannon I but doesn't require the T2 artillery skill.
---
No i don't. Because bigger groups won't be hurt and smaller groups will be smashed to itty bitty pieces by groups slightly larger than them in order to make themselves bigger. 
---
And the biggest groups (the ones that should be targeted for breaking up) won't be affected either way because it's too much effort to bother with the small frys and said small frys already can't do any damage to them.
---
HURR DURRR WHLER BTW.... JUST NEED TO ROLL THE HOLES IN MY EMPTY KRAB HOLE FOR DANK TICKS...
---
Would cost too much, I would just invest in a freighter, 1b isnt gank-worthy
---
Why does that even matter?  Maybe they did?
---
You just named 4 systems in 4 different regions. This sec drop would only happen in ONE region for ONE month. So you're wrong. travel would barely be affected and if anything you'd just have to take another route.
---
No, you died and the right amount of info was taken from you, we know this because we know who now has that info.
---
I LEAVE THEM OPEN AND CRUSH INVADERS WITH A CAPITAL FLEET
---
GET SOME!
---
"Everyone I disagree with is an alt", the child's guide to responding to being called out online.

Also, I thought I was blocked, my dude. 😎
---
I'm up to this challenge. Who are you?
---
The biggest groups just can’t be run without tools. The smaller ones can.
---
Literally go walk in and ask.  Or if you have more normal social skills call in and ask.
---
No you’re the only one shitting this up so strongly and using the same language in each post.  And yeah get it out of your system cause you’ll be blocked and never have to see another of my posts or comments again
---
You're completely wrong. 
---
Corp A and Corp B can'r rep each other anyways. They both are at war. 
---
Quoted from Dev Blog:
---
&gt;**Removal of neutral assistance**  
---
&gt;Under current mechanics, if a neutral character applies a remote assistance module (such as a remote repairer) to another character they can receive a suspect flag if their target meets all of the following conditions:
---
1. is involved in a war (including normal wars or FW)
---
2. does not share a corp/alliance (or FW side if the war in question is the FW war) with the assistor
---
3. is engaged in PVP (has a capsuleer logoff timer)
---
&gt; After the April release, the penalty for direct targeted neutral assistance meeting the conditions above AND occurring within highsec will become a criminal flag and CONCORD response. 
---
It does not matter if it is a shared war. If they are not in the same corp/alliance they get Concorded.
---
Hey, welcome!
---
The CCP office really isn't set up to handle drop-in visitors.  However, outside our office, next to the Reykjavík Old Harbor, you can take a look at the Eve monument.
---
Hope you have a great visit to Iceland!
---
Whatever, my dude. Keep whining. 😎
---
Your comment about Squizz losing his place in game...
---
True
---
Overkill is bad and makes people not want to undock or fly fun loss mails. This "drop everything 100:1" mentality is the cause of the decay of eve, at least, the interesting risky part of it.
---
Me too, first corp I joined was in that pocket.
---
You quit Eve and you're here talking about changes dont apply to you??
---
No, you died, and someone was given unrestricted info by the game they shouldnt have and dont own. This is made public by CCPs API and is fetched by sites causing the free-intel problem we see.
---
upvoted
---
I'd rather see solid balance that the majority of the community are happy with across existing classes first.
---
Then again, the chief complaint at any time from any mmo community is "the pvp is unbalanced" so there's always that to consider.
---
Yeah, this is in bad taste all around on your end. Legit seems like your karma whoreing or virtue signaling, either way you come off smelling like shit.
---
 I appreciate the response! I will definitely be sure to go look for it!
---
Thank you, Its been great!
---
I didn’t want to call you that... but you said it man not me
---
ITT people think OP is seeking attention when we really know no one will remember his name or anything and just want to be dicks, even though he is raising awareness of a tragedy. Gr8 community.
---
Next time you losers have a moment of Silence at work for a tragedy I hope you back up your faggy attitudes and interrupt it saying "stop attention whoring lel".
---
If you really wanted “content” you’d ask to remove the content denying modules and designs.
---
I.e covert ops cloak, nullified, and nano speed fits
---
&gt; No, you died, and someone was given unrestricted info by the game they shouldnt have and dont own.
---
No, you died, and I was given the info I was supposed to be given, hence why I now own that info.
---
&gt; This is made public by CCPs API and is fetched by sites causing the free-intel problem we see.
---
No, it's made public by me by posting my kill report of your death or by a killboard that I have given permission to do so on my behalf.
---
No, the Moracha's ID is 33395, which is fine since it's explicitly a Force Recon variant of the Ixion hull.
---
You're certainly coming across as very forthright and reasonable, yourself.
---
Jump right on the bandwagon, faggot.
---
Sure, let's name every fleet comp anyone has used in the past year with more than 20 people. Many other comps were used in specific situations back when the hurricane was king as well, so go ahead and go get all those comps too so we can compare apples to apples.
---
Since when were EVE players not risk averse? It's a part of the game. Most fights are preordained before they even start and the best PVPers are best not only because of their mechanical skill, but also because they know which fights they can take. Just making everyone fight because they run into each other is not proper fighting, that's a hot mess.
---
Losing his 'place' in the game means squizz losing his place as the #1 killboard provider. I don't know wtf you thought that meant.
---
Hel of a nice kill
---
Why are you angry?
---
Some people play games to get away from RL and the political shit as well.
---
Yup people can’t do anything for good reasons anymore.
---
People will happily gank an empty freighter just for the tears. DSTs work great, but it's best to leave freighter hauling to the professionals and stick with contracts. You can get a looooot of stuff hauled for 1B.
---
Excellent consider me learnt. Good to know.
---
Yup my mistake for thinking this /r/eve community could get their heads out of their asses for 2 mins to pay respects.  Fuck me
---

Careful with your honesty on this sub people aren't used to it and may be extremely confused. 
---
\*stabs himself with pitchfork having nowhere else to put it\*
---
No you can do good things, but you picked a horrible thing to do "good thing's" about. Instead of fucking jumping on reddit and whoreing out to a crowd about you want to hold a vigil, actually look up the fucking family's that where affected by this and help them out personally. You coming onto reddit to karma whore like hoe on the streets makes me literally want to pimp slap you in game.
---
I accept your apology. Sorry I had to curse. Be well.
---
Is it though? Because there's a public database of those
---
If he would have paid attention and actually self repped he could have tanked that.
---
Russians would have been all over that.
---
You can't buy knowledge and experience in eve which is far more important than the amount of isk you have or that you're flying the most expensive and powerful ships.
---
Politicians are calling games the problem and not dealing with gun control.  Gamers are people first.  We need to be together and united for common interests
---
As I said above: Highsec wars do not include capital ships
---
Fuck off.  Be well
---
K
---
That lance was on point. Ain't even mad.
---
I find the best way to deal with eve players is to assume they're all literally riding an unlubed stick they found in a pile of manure. They like to get mad and mob up over anything they can.
---
We were promised 10% falloff increase for medium ACs but instead received a completely unexpected 10% optimal to medium beams.
---
what the fuck
---
The ESI isn't the only tool those groups use you know that right? You won't stop them just make it inconvenient for them. Holy shit you are the big dumb.
---
This the problem when intelligent people make a game. They assume that everyone knows what they know. 
---
How hard would it be for a dev to screen record what they want a person to do?
---
still recovering from the blue waffles drama
---
This whole video hurts my eyes
---
You wouldn't say that in AU TZ!
---
&gt;This is not free intel, someone put forth the effort to kill the ship in question to learn about it. Then, one of the pilots involved made the conscious choice to share that with others by uploading it to zkillboard, having an ESI Token do it, or joining a Corp that does so.
---
So if that happens consistently, it must be seen as free intel. Otherwise the discussion only deals with the symptom and not the cause.
---
&gt;I don't see the problem. Again, the victor earned this intel.
---
How do you earn intel by doing nothing specific to get info on modules that are destroyed?
---
&gt;The game isn't adding information, those modules were there the whole time. The fact that they were destroyed is tangential. I mean, unless you are unironically saying that anything destroyed should be vaporized in such a manner that no method of forensic science known to man now, or in the future, would be able to tell what kind of module has its slagged remains plugged in to slot #4.
---
If they are destroyed, they are no longer there. From an intel standpoint, they are treated identical to non-destroyed ones. Why should you have perfect intel on those every time without doing anything?
---
&gt;Just because the killmail is not "limited" in the way you want it to be does not mean it isn't.
---
You get enough intel to recreate the fit. Enough intel for people to look it up and determine if its killable. That cannot be seen as "limited" since it doesnt impose a relevant limit.
---
&gt;Now, if you want to talk about limiting uninvolved parties' access to the details of the killmail, that's a different discussion. 
---
That's the real problem because the only way to restrict it AFTER the mail has been made public is for it not to contain certain info in the first place.
---
Personally I believe it’s one gatekeeping asshole with a dozen reddit accounts who thinks he needs to sjw a perceived karma post and can’t appreciate true humanity.  Most of this sub is complete trash. It’s really really disappointing sometimes
---
They stole your info, they do not own it.
---
It is made public by CCP by sharing it with whoever killed you.
---
I smell self-righteousness
---
Can't be true. Doesn't have ship spinning.

Thanks for inviting us &lt;3

Shit your mouth you whore, some of the best content in the game has come from idiots with Titans and supers
---
... Those Eve and Star Citizen ships don't look anything alike except that they're both reminiscent of a fork lift.
---
Siege your own hole - problem solved
---
They don't cycle faster, they cycle the exact same speed. They also share reload times. You get vastly more cap in a shorter timeframe from a capital capbooster, and a serious increase over time too. A t2 heavy gets you +145.5cap/s, a t2 capital gets you 234.1cap/s
---
You use battleship boosters on armorfax because they use significantly less cpu and comically little PG, it's a BS mod after all. Midslots are plentiful on armorfaxes, CPU/PG not so much. Having all that spare PG allows you to fit more capital (remote) reps, plates, capacitor transmitter.
---
Do you even know what that means?  I’m not “self righteous”... oh maybe in that I believe we shouldn’t have gun violence anymore?  Why is that a pretentious and supposedly moral superiority issue?  Shouldn’t we strive as a society to be free from the threat of being shot up at schools and malls?
---
Ohhh you have no idea.
---
holy shit suck his dick more lmfao god damn yall are some brainwashed shitters

no one more successful? I guess you forgot NC / PL / Horde / GOTG evicted us from Deklein like 4 years ago - but keep drinking the sauce dude!

that's b/c you clearly don't know what's good in-game and what's bad, this honey pot is exposing all sorts of dumbasses :D

The people who live out there are weird.

&gt; They stole your info, they do not own it.
---
It's my info the moment you die.
---
&gt; It is made public by CCP by sharing it with whoever killed you.
---
Nope, it's given to the 2 parties involved, its up to them who they then give it too. It's like you don't even know how the mechanic works.
---
So this is political?  Why do I need to talk about gun control?  Did the fucking gun walk itself into walmart and start shooting?
---
It appears to me they predominantly hunt for their own loss reports. Looks like a good source of content to me, why bash their structure.
---
Got to train social interactions to 5 to get in 😂
---
&gt;We don’t know what will be classified as personal in the years to come or what the new laws will be used for and iterated on
---
So you admit there is no standing RIGHT NOW, to make your argument valid good.

I had a feeling this was karma baiting or trolling

but after reading op’s sperg lording comments to anything that doesn’t kiss their ass i’m 100% sure he’s trolling

This should not be a thing.

That's how power creep happens, Minnie hulls are largely op and we all know it. Nerf then don't buff everything else. 
---
The only category of hulls that could arguably use a blanket buff would be maybe all the t3c's but the Loki.
---
Even that is debatable though, as t3c's are already very overused.
---
They look like wallet warriows, i dont care to kill their structures, they can put another one, i dont belive they will leave after this kill

Those just seem like reasons you died or couldn't kill someone. LOL

the only thing I tryhard at is figuring out the best red for your mother's pallet when I tap dat ass later tonight
---
Unless it's low sec or null. What's your point? I get the feeling you don't have one.
---
Why do you speak up for only one side of the community though?  The game needs balance.  I’d love to be able to have a counter to someone running at 8km/second or cloaking for 12 hours inbetween shooting defenseless ships.
---
I used to do a ton of pvp specifically hunting “hunters” and the changes have become so favored to them to never die unless they mess up or get greedy.
---
New players don’t get eve to die without being able to counter it, old players don’t like that either on the receiving end... it isn’t engaging or challenging.  It’s just lame.  
---
Idk if you ever mined of ratted or done those “fun” activities, but you gotta play that field to see what it’s like to grind for 30+ hours for the rewards you get.  the only exceptions being super ratting and the highest tier pve (but you’ll never balance something paying several 100m/hour in a game where titans are only 40-50b nowadays... )
---
Be for the people... but damn man try to set your playstyle’s biases aside.  It’s hard (trust me i’m very much for economic and pve being viable).  Just live up to your words :)
---
Remember.  Wormholes aren’t as filled as nullsec for a reason.  And the reason isn’t it’s so fun that everyone wants to do it despite its inherent safety done “smart”
---
You're right. Best anti bot would be an anti cheat. But CCP dont want to do that. 
---
And players don't seem to question this
---
More like 90.
---
It doesn't take too long to chew through a full system of them, you might just not have too many active PVE people around you. But I also notice a lot of people don't bother with sites that don't escalate or have chances for faction drops.
---
No, it's just moronic. Like you.

I know that it's probably some 4d chess shitpost that I'm missing but wasn't wtb_killmarks the one who got that vendetta 2-3 weeks ago?

1. As stated, the economy has grown. So, there is price deflation and economic deflation. I didn't state price deflation and your clarification is fair, I meant price deflation not economic deflation.
---
2. Categorically you are right of course, rorqing doesn't introduce isk, ratting and botting does and I used the phrase "isk faucet leveraging" in a general sense - as a way of describing a way to "turn of the tap on hard", but specifically you are right.

I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT WAS UNTIL I WANTED TO GET RID OF JUNK I DON'T NEED FROM A CITADEL THAT GOT LEFT IN LOW-POWER AFTER THE SCAMMING CEO OF MY OLD CORP DROPPED THE HAMMER AND WE ALL SPLIT. MOST OF THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE CORP ARE GOOD FOLKS AND I'M NOT ENTIRELY POSITIVE THE CEO PLANNED ON SCAMMING, BUT HE SURE STARTED ACTING FUNNY RIGHT BEFORE GHOSTING US.

Skill injectors are not isk sinks or faucets and therefore irrelevant to the conversation.

It is shared, and the sharing causes it to be made public which causes the problem of free intel. Do you get it?

Seeing your fellow capsuleers prance around holding up contracts as they run.

"SeLlInG pLeX!! coNVo mE!"  Reverberates through the station section designated to the elite of the elite. You hear the group of hecklers jeering him loudly.
---
The training didn't prepare you to see your fellow pilot turn into these monstrous husks of what once was humans.
---
Please never change Jita local, there is no game on earth that can replace it. I love the vile scum that dwells there
---
&gt; They dont own your info when you die.
---
I own a copy when I kill you. its called a kill report and is generated on the destruction of your ship. 
---
&gt; the sharing causes it to be made public
---
Nope, it is given to the two parties involved, it only goes anywhere else if one of those parties chooses for it too and that's either parties prerogative.
---
&gt; which causes the problem of free intel.
---
Its not free, you had to be hunted and killed and one of us had to post.

Moh in derelik...

dont worry 15% of 0 is nothing

Main in NC. downboated...

I used to live in the Arand constellation (Essence) 3-4 years ago.   Constant 3/10's, 4/10's and there was so many Dens, you could get a lot of 5/10's as well.     It's well farmed now though unfortunately.

You don't seem too far off
---
Hey stop getting in the way of the narrative...

Minmatar hulls are largely fine. The muninn's dominance makes them seem overly common, but nobody uses hurricane fleets anymore, and battleship fleets of all flavors are out of style bar some faction stuff.

Maybe PM him?

&gt;I own a copy when I kill you. its called a kill report and is generated on the destruction of your ship. 
---
CCP shares info on your loss when you die. The ownership doesnt change.
---
&gt;Nope, it is given to the two parties involved, it only goes anywhere else if one of those parties chooses for it too and that's either parties prerogative.
---
The sharing by CCP causes it be made public. If CCP does not share it, it cannot go anywhere.
---
&gt;Its not free, you had to be hunted and killed and one of us had to post.
---
After you have been killed, the info shared by CCP ends up on killboards and the free intel problem is a fact.

EVE having a slow season when a hordling with the aim of a 3 year old trying to piss is at the top
---
No, but he's been the soul of Brave for some time.
---
It makes sense that someone losing their ship would have a log of who destroyed it though. That's fine in lore to me.
---
Why? He's making the game better for you all
---
It is a regional that is to far to jump, hence goons have it perma camped. A message to the right person stops this though and safe passage would of been granted.
---
It's great content. Like me.
---
Bill, please. Bait requires a bit more subtlety and nuance than this.
