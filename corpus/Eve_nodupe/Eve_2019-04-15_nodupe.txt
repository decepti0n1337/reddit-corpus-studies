You're right that there are passive resist modules for both armor and shield, for single resist types. However there is no shield equivalent for the Energized Adaptive Nano Membrane (passive) except the Adaptive Invulnerability Field (active).

Hm, I think Fraternity is active on TQ for far longer, and I think they were mostly 'refugees' from Serenity (at least according to the latest RnK video, \~6months ago, regarding stuff going on the Chinese server).

So the short form of nullsec politics from the last year as I understand it (wormholer^(btw))
---
Circle of Two backstabbed Goonswarm and joined Pandemic, TEST left Pandemic and allied with Goonswarm, and then both of them absolutely obliterated Circle of Two from existence. Also everyone beat up CVA/Providence again. After that took up most of last year, TEST decided to shove IChooseYou out of Perimeter and so now TEST owns that trade hub, and then TEST and Pandemic have been fighting over that for the last few months. Also last year, the Drone Russian Federation got shoved out of the dronelands by Fraternity., and this month the DRF legitimately banded together under the name [FI.RE](https://FI.RE), and the DRF, TEST, and Goons scorched earth burned Fraternity. and Brothers of Tangra's renter territory.

Meanwhile, in December, The Initiative completed a year-long seeding-invasion of Hard Knocks and blew up Fort Knocks with a fleet of about a thousand Ravens, Command Destroyers, and Reddit threads. Hard Knocks and LAZERHAWKS have since then established sov in a few nullsec regions, although I have no idea who they're allied with. And then last week, INIT.'s poster boy and CSM member Brisc Rubal got his account permabanned (along with two other INIT. FCs) for NDA violation, resulting in an /r/eve field day.
---
Balance wise, Triglavian ships are bonkers (more news at 11), Carriers just got their ability to instakill frigates nerfed a bit, HAW guns on Titans got whacked, Rorquals are about 5% less invulnerable and Excavators 6% less silly, and Porn Maker is still the richest ganker in New Eden.
---
Probably right enough. They didn't all join [FRT] either, some went to the Imperium and joined Peoples Liberation Army [P.L.A].
---
Whenever I see things like this I think how different the language must be for that to be what came out.

Regardless it's got to be hard as hell to learn English not to mention learn it in an environment with so much slang and memeing

True. they'll just cyno in a couple titans and supers and boson / blap everything rather then actually play.

No.

LZHK / QUIET is acting like they are baiting for SkillU so goons can act like they are feeding so that later goons can fight with SkillU and feed more without LZHK / QUIET having to show up I think maybe I'm no sure but yes. ?

They still have their uses. But since they were on top some new ships showed up and some changes have taken place. Drakes didn't get nerfed to uselessness, but are just simply outdone in many areas and situations by other ships now.

I feel like it is a mute point
---
You see Ivan, if you shitpost on reddit before fight, Enemy will not shoot back, for too busy responding to posts
---
To summarize: CCPlease redo the bounty system, force some players to travel in low-sec and increase ressource scarcity.
---
I understand that it's a gross summary, but it really seems shallow. Either elaborate on your ideas, or on their intent. "I want more people to hunt in low-sec" sounds like a bored gate camper, don't make one third of your campaign based around that.
---
TBH I would rather have Trig online then any thing else online since Trig ships are actually fun to play in unlike so much of the other shit we got that has gone stale and stagnant. Even PvE in Trig ships is engaging. Not most efficient, but who cares it can be actually kinda fun.
---
I just looked you up on zkill, honestly, you look like the most un-interesting player i've seen in a long time. CSM will be a good fit for you.
---
&gt;Primarily, I will advocate for a joint wardec and bounty system that will allow non-structure based war goals, allow highsec wardecers, mercs, and pirates to still be a viable profession while at the same time protecting new players from the type of actions that can make players prematurely leave New Eden.  
---
How would you go about this? The two ideologies are directly opposed. War dec's are not used (besides the TEST/PH one I guess) to create content for two groups. It's used for one group to club the other through ignorance or inexperience. The kind of people that are using war dec's as their primary content source are not people who want fights. They are people who want to beat off about their killboard of t1 haulers, miners, and Orcas. If you want to do what you elude to, you'll need to change the culture around the entire thing as well.  
---
All in all, very vague. Nothing of substance at all.
---
&gt;it wasn’t like gallente said ‘hold on boys, stop hitting the plexes, let us go down to tier 1 so that our LP increases in value’
---
We have had people saying literally this for several months.  BUT, props to the CalMil guys who finally got organized enough to make the push.  GalMil does want to cash out, but we also want to see more good fights from CalMil along the way. Keep up the good work.
---
That's a bit off though aint it ? the next Trig ships are an AF and a VedHAC. Pass that we don't know, we speculate that it will be a dread or a cap of some sort, but who knows.
---
Last I checked they dropped (or at least talked about pulling out) some time after they started renting from TEST. 
---
(Queue triggered FEDUP downvoting this bait)
---
Condors don't have gun turret hardpoints. Only missiles. So you'll need to try to fit rockets or light missiles.
---
&gt;Is a nerf of this shit currently planned? How a kiting ship can apply enough DPS to kill a MAAR + MAR cruiser while being still able to stay completely out of his gun?  
---
&gt;PS: pls biomass ig if you have ever flown one.  
---
&gt;PS2: yes, i'm mad.
---
Trig ships are a bit OP and underpowered. they need some tweaks. Kiki and Drekavac are strong, while Demavik and Vedmak kinda suck.
---
Keep in mind that they require Abyss runs to construct and that is not exactly a risk free activity, jsut check the killboards.
---
Also CCP made them a bit OP and Omega only for obvious reasons.
---
Condors have only slots for missile launchers, not turrets.   While they both occupy high slots, they are considered separate for fitting purposes.
---
Can confirm. Absolutely never.
---
No they're not they're the fucking trash of the universe. I know, because I used to FC spectre fleets.
---
There's a 3 limits concerning those "High slots".
---
1. The actual number of modules that can go there (in this case, 4)
---
2. The number of guns/mining lasers your ship's hardpoints can handle (in this case, 0, and that's your problem)
---
3. The number of missile launchers your ship's hardpoints can handle (in this case, 3, as the condor uses missiles as it's weapon system)
---
Since your gun capacity is 0, attempting to put a gun there tells you that all gun slots are full. Note that you can still put missiles launchers if there's still room for those.
---
They are actually a very large group, with too much space. They kept the space for so long by blueing everyone around them.

Many of the systems we have taken haven’t changed hands since 2013.

o7 from Bombers Bar, it was a blast flying with you boys today! Thanks for sharing your feast with us :)

&gt; As my professional career has developed, I have found myself with less  time to spend ingame. The time requirements of 0.0 fleet warfare and  wormhole life are oppressive and so the last few years, I have been a  devotee of highsec pvp. 
---
Highsec PvP is an oxymoron. You have less time to play EVE but you want to run for the CSM? ok fam?

BB gang checkin' in.

Those caps melted real nice, thanks for the backup!

Slippery Pete's are the only fleet that made me actually salty.

If you want someone to fly with for a few hours to ask any question you can think of, let me know. I find helping newbros more rewarding than actually playing the game nowadays.
---
Ok, so after some search (and trying to decipher Chinese-&gt;English Google translate results), it seems that Netease is trying to 'reboot' Serenity. I think they have a dump of the Serenity data / DB / state from the previous operator, but if I understand correctly they had only been doing test deployments, which they wipe after some time. It seems that they might have actually done a proper deployment now.
---
They also seem to have a very restrictive EULA (due to Chinese legislation or sth), regarding harassment etc, which effectively ruins the game, so I guess there won't be many people going back, even if there's a proper new deployment. And according to a recent Reddit post, they also have 'RMT' built-in the game.
---
I asked because the 'political' situation on Serenity (as described by Lord Maldolor in the last RnK Serenity video) sounded interesting and  I wanted to know if there were any updates.
---
Btw, it would be also interesting to have some stats on how many of the Serenity players have actually joined TQ. I think Fraternity consists mainly of the refugees / enemies of the Serenity powerblock (PIBC). I wonder if any PIBC guys have joined TQ and which alliances / corps they joined / formed.
---
What an amazing drop. Good fights all around.

Ok thanks

you are an idiot, putting 150-200B isk on the line with minimal backup is ballsy regardless of what you are engaging.  People monitor killboards and track ships like these, so despite what you are engaging, you are inviting the entire universe to attack you.

Russians actually leaving dronelands?!?! Never thought id live to see it.

It's a kitey destroyer that is next to impossible to get under is the point. A confessor is also a destroyer that you can kill in an atron if they play badly.

i mean if not that they'd be about what? making the other side lose isk? cause if that's the case you almost won it for them

I fear this change, while much needed by both us and our new Chinese friends, may never come to be. Long ago, I approached Godemperor Hilmar with my humble request for a similar system. Upon hearing my request, he stopped writing a press release about EVE: Project Tengu long enough to turn his head and fill my heart with terror. While begging for his forgiveness I slowly backed away, but then I saw locked in a cage none other than CCP Guard, who never went to the magic game studio in the sky after all. The moment Hellmar realised what I saw, his arms turned into Hello Kitty anime titans with pink glittery doomsdays and laser turrets firing all colours of the rainbow. He's locked me away with CCP Guard, and I'm afraid he might find out about my reddit account soon. Please send help, I can see the GMs coming towards us carrying boxes....

Don’t know if there’s a right way but I’ve always learned that if a noun ends with a ‘s’ all you do is add the apostrophe after it. For example, Jones’ carrier, Jacobs’ big dick ,etc.

Aw that's cute, it thinks we care about isk

You either an ill-bred chinese TAPI or a frt idiot.

In this case the noun is "post" referring to the singular, specific post.   The possessive form of the noun should (iirc) be "post's".

Spectre fleet is the fc's that run it. When trash leaves the quality goes up. Says a lot for your fcing? Unless your calling the pilots in Spectre Fleet trash? in which case, as it is public and TAPI are in almost every fleet? You may be onto something.
---
Ya, sure. No point in putting deadspace on a super anymore, not when a hull can cost you 12-13b.
---
Even for titans it is getting kind of iffy. I mean, a titan hull costs a null bloc player like 50-60b. They just aren't that expensive anymore. T2 is good enough now.
---
50-60? you must be in a shit nullbloc

Yeah. They didn't want to leave, they kinda got forced out. Which is why they're right now trying to take it back.

You can "jump" with no cooldown to a pod that is located in the same citadel as you are. This is available even if you have a 24h cooldown going on.

You listed three goals here and they basically amount to "mess with highsec, mess with lowsec, mess with nullsec." Seems you cast a net too wide; you'd appear to be just another vote to whatever is going on at the time.
---
&gt;As my professional career has developed, I have found myself with less time to spend ingame.
---
It sounds like you're winning EVE btw
---
No this isn't some heroic speech where you inspire the fucking troops to overcome all odds. If you ask a fleet member to tackle a target, and he asks "how do you tackle" it's not that you're such a shit FC, is that you have shit tier fleet mates. Your narrative is retarded and so are you.

many of the DRF russians are now in angel space, fighting for possibly more angel space.
---
They strike me as a good bit higher caliber than the average renter.
---
&gt;What is the biggest issue with EVE right now? Are the bot swarms fixed?
---
They continue to grow bigger. Also related issue is that we are continuously bleeding live actual players who are being slowly replaced by AFK or bot or multiboxed accounts. All these combined greatly contribute to other major issues in the game that piss off a lot of people to the point of quitting.
---
&gt; mechanically at least?
---
Yes. The mechanics of it as a whole, the spool up DPS combined with the armor and good sig and speed. Also the range on occult even with the range bonus hulls makes them kinda "brawlish". Glass cannon fits are the most fun of all, its kill fast or die fast trying. 
---
Also they are difficult to bot and require very active playstyles. You have to watch speed, transversal, angular, pilot to them, whole bunch of stuff. They are simply more engaging then any other ships in the game.
---
&gt; One of the new t2 trig ships is a t2 Kiki with boosh and commmand bursts. It’s minmatar t2.
---
Hmm, I didn't see that, only the AF and HAC, got a link ?
---
True, I hadn't noticed that. In that case his english isn't as good as I thought it was
---
haha ?:OkHand:
---
This.
---
Basically, even an active armor tank has a considerable buffer when cap drained due to the passive resist stacking and just general large hp pools for the armor value.
---
Even passive shield tanks, nine times out of ten, are at least somewhat dependent on active invul or ward mods adding enough resist that the shield recharge outpaces incoming DPS. The plan, of course, is that the passive tank is really not meant to deal with burst alpha or neuting (at least as when it's most often fit, on PVE boats). The active modules are typically preferred because the other lack of cap drained without an active booster means you have plenty of overhead.
---
However, without invuls or wards shield resists are bad - no worse than armor, just with different holes to be sure, except the resist mods for the armor don't need cap to run.
---
I DM for friends and am toying with the idea of making a kind of table top Eve Online game, for story/ lore purposes, is it fair to say a capsuleer IS basically the ship, performing all commands and functions, however ships are capable of being crewed by NPC's when a capsuleer isn't present or wants a crew?  
---
I understand the listed statistics of ship size to crew holdings, and the level of automation differing between factions, since crew members are never brought up between agents and capsuleers this solution feels right and would allow players to have more options and not have to deal with the logistics of crews if they don't want to.
---
4 a day holy shit
---
Galmil is cashing out, I'm sure there are dudes in WANGS, FEDUP and other groups that are sitting on fat stack of LP, just waiting for it to climb higher and higher.
---
What is booshing? I'm noob.
---
Lore says frigates are piloted by Capsuleers entirely. Anything larger has at least a few crew aboard.
---
To put other parts of the lore in perspective: 1 ISK, the in-game currency that we spend by the millions or billions? ONE ISK is the average annual wage of a non-capsuleer.
---
I mean can't knock Test for saying they are fighting all of Eve.

The average goon is also -10 to blood raiders and since there's no BR arc it can take a while to bring those standings up, and that's time wasted not spodding out.

What does this even mean or do to meaningfully answer OPs question?

1 isk = the annual salary of a non-capsuleer!? I supposed buying a person's retirement is part of buying the ship? 
---
Playing with the planetary interactions and the lack of crew interactions feels cold and empty. The PI made me miss Galactic Civilizations and Civ, Eve feels both alive and dead at the same time and it's weird. 
---
Thanks for that info though. What are your thoughts about crew/ NPC interaction? I wrote a few short stories about NPCs having to deal with a crazy capsuleer thinking it would be funny. Most of the crew had to get back home using infected drone ships and avoiding the insane capsuleer who wanted target practice.

switched from fraps because fraps is locked to one window and I multibox with isboxer, obs lets me capture a screen not a window

but nothing I do in the recording settings gets me anywhere close to the quality of fraps
---
yeah man it's real hard to fight off bombers bar I agree
---
Except it’s not warpable from anywhere in space you can only see it on grid and it doesn’t matter if the moon is active or not. That’s the key part of my comment. There should be a warpable spot from anywhere in the system when there is a belt spawned there, so that you know what moon is being actively mined and have a warpin to it.
---
If i could not procrastinate so much i'd put more effort into editing it. But i'm going to be honest the comms are soo great.
---
Yeah you can based on this list, seeing as you're including a range of NPC corps, a cloaky camping alt corp, DARKNESS (who are now actively assisting TEST in Perimeter stratops) and neutral smallgang entities. Is the correct response to this post a Pastebin of every corp in a Legacy and Imperium Alliance, or every character?
---
TAPI persecution complex is too strange for fiction sometimes.
---
that doesn't make [br.inyour.space](https://br.inyour.space) working again, sorry you can't handle the truth

Look into SLOBS (streamlabs OBS) it has screen capture also easier to use

Oy you there in that AWACs of yours.

&gt; This is disgusting. They log in, activate hack and jump to their triangle ships before they even materialise. Litteraly. There is just no time to do anything else. Like how is this supposed to be fair. Meanwhile meowtiger is parading around saying that we should calm down and that everything is fine.
---
I'm just calling it now :D

The FRT revenant pilot didn't post a boo-hoo I lost my ship I'm a special snowflake post, he was busy building himself a motherfucking ragnarok

This isn't all of eve these are just a handful of corps that are next on the block for Mergeliner.

Keep asking questions and you will go far.

---
Is there any alternative to eve-survival thats up to date? Basically looking for a list of missions and the fastest way to blitz them
---
Make it an increasing chance to flip, otherwise you can just fuel it once per month?
---
Their tank and DPS is actually way above what people expect when they see drake 
---
They're mean as fuck boats.
---
Is there any mission in particular that wasn't up to date?
---
I did l4 blitzes for a week or two after coming back, andI have yet to not find a particular mission, and all the triggers/flags appeared to be the same..
---
laughs in 300%
---
I liked the "you serious?" as your carrier casually tanked a doomsday
---
I was just doing a mission called demolition and couldn't find anything about it. Or at least I thought that was the name of it, that was only the second mission I've ever done. It was a lvl 1 FW mission.
---
They have a Keepstar in Perimeter?
---
/I’ve not been there in years.
---
Considering application was nerfed at the same time, giving up mids is worse now than before
---
Ohhh, yeah, I'm pretty sure it only accurately lists NPC corporation missions... There's an FW page, but it even says on it "we're missing many FW mission reports"... Because it's a relatively low-participation thing.
---
I believe these are what TAPI call "Master Race" Fax (classy name BTW), which are supposed to be high tank/endurance support for things which aren't super caps (carriers/subcaps) as you can see from the video LMAOster Race is fax when they encounter big boy dps and neut pressure. Perhaps the next evolution of the DinoSwarm will learn that Lif is life.
---
They're basically drakes pre-nerf, right? Extra launcher slot and all that.
---
amazing work, gg mate
---
Good job meow. Twas a really fun fleet.
---
Depending what kind of fit you use and what you run.        
---
Totally considering testing a thanny/nid with full application warp and sensors kits.       
---
Just out of simple curiosity how this will work.
---
Secondly, I will advocate for the implementation of systems that will make it necessary for players to travel in lowsec more often.
---
( just remove lowsec)
---
Thirdly, I will advocate for changes to null sec resource spawning that will necessitate more conflict between the large power-blocs.

(add more anomalies so l can Krab more)

Think the soundcloud chat is a few months old. They were talking about Elon musk's interview with Joe Roegan as if it was recent news.

When Horde gets a mention before Legion. What a time to be alive!

Oh is that right? Well the players expected it to shut down and that's why they came to our server.
---
A single rat is not dangerous, its the fact that you usually get 10 or more of them at once that is dangerous

Because you wouldn't get any.
---
It's just the same old FW... System control and tides of conflict controlled by the LP store and some farming alts... Rather than actual PvP and tactics.

Yeah, there might have been some good fights here and there, but from a "bigger picture" kinda view, these fights  are pretty much for sport.

I mean the point is that they have to spool up, thats the drawback, making that it take far too long to do good DPS in big fleet fights. They're meant to give small gang/solo the advantage in well coordinated longer small fights.

&gt;They are actually a very large group, with too much space. They kept the space for so long by blueing everyone around them.
---
Why are we discussing Legacy in this thread?
---
Hey, I'm all for content. I'm all for conflict and knocking the walls down. But you're just so damned smug I cant bring myself to like you.
---
lol
---
It's not a step backward, it's doing something else. I've done some reasonably elite things in the game - and yes, Wormholer, btw to you, too ;) - but there are still times when I can enjoy chilling afk mining in highsec in my Orca, catching up with chat channels and discord and whatnot.  
---
That's what a sandbox is about. Good for him having fun doing whatever it is he does.
---
When half of this subreddit are socially conditioned to shit on me I don't blame some neutrals for finding it hard to like me. Afterall I am human and I respond to shit with shit like many people do. At some point I'm bound to look like the shitlord. 
---
You should have seen me 2 years ago. I came a long way since then.
---
Nope, they have been the power in panfam that everyone looks out for 1st for a lot longer than that. They undock, and in ships bigger than cruisers .
---
How do you tell if someone is a Wormholer?
---
Oh don't worry, they will tell you. They will goddam make sure you know.
---
INIT. guy with inside information. *shock*
---
Oh i know but the dps spool is currently  pretty oppressive  from what ive been hearing.  Why use any thing else when you can have a destoryer that does 800dps
---
It's less the fighting back/ grrr side. More the "look at what only I do" and "I do (such and such) by myself, I'm stopping the gewn menace by myself" bit that gets me. Comes off as 100% arrogance. Worse (by a smidge) than us wormholers.
---
That's true. Took a baby 10 man roam through there once. Was met by 2 super caps, then was matched in size by a brutix gang. We died, was fun!
---
&gt; Is everyone still grrr goons, 
---
Not everyone: there's a lot of goons &amp; pets, and a ton of highsec players who neither know nor care about nullsec politics.  
---
&gt;is there still a big blue donut,
---
What do you think? :)
---
&gt;what are  the nullsec alliances. 
---
Same as a year ago
---
&gt;Also, I used to be a part of one of the most  elite galmil corps 
---
All I know about FW is it's a bunch of people claiming they're elite and moaning that FW is dead and CCP has forgotten them. What's sort of new is that since last year CCP said it wasn't planning to do anything about FW. So everyone used to think CCP didn't care about FW but now it's official: progress, of a sort.
---
I've been pretty specific about what I did. People want to downplay it and I respond. I never claimed "stopping the goon menace by myself", for example. I did claim things like increasing mining risk of their Rorquals from about 3% to 5%. That's more than what anyone else does, but I never denied it's pretty insignificant. 
---
Again, when there are 200 people here conditioned to shit on me it's easy for me to "come off" to you as arrogant.
---
&gt; or buy lots of plex to keep up on your losses. 
---
Or fly cheaper ships. Or make ISK through other means (artwork, services). Or join a corp with SRP. Or join a group where you have less risk of losing a ship. Or combine PvE and PvP.
---
I dont know, blaming renters that they didnt formed? It should be done by ther landlord, right?

 I find tools that literally do all the market analysis a soft form of cheating,you as developers are encouraging this over smart thinking from your players interested in trading.Also it has opened the door for alot of boting on the market
---
Yes, it is.
---
Hey I didn't sign the NDA someone else did
---
the question wasn't about what the mechanic should be, it was to see if  there is a way to see what belt is spawned right now, which there is not.
---
My question is how the fuck you've got access to the DB ?? I doubt it's stored locally
---
Good layout so good combinaison of DPS and tanking, reasonnable speed, and utility high and it also have a application bonus

Yes, TEST put one up when they kicked PHs HS market program out the window some time back.
---
How safe is that place for someone doing a lot of trading is debatable at best.
---
Yes they run it at 0.1% Frat keep putting up 0.0% Azbels to fuck with them though.

The Dark Party Initiative
---
Amarr and Caldari triage are the best Ed, what are you talking about?  Why would I want a hull with faster remote repping times and a beast of a local tank when I can slam the same identical hull and fit at every problem and wonder why it dies?
---
Yeah it s really a shame that we boson our own nyx, really...
---
PH forms a fleet, go on KS grid, some in TEST notices it, if fleet is big enough, we jump clone in, then PH blueballs us. If we don't go, they reinforce it into armor. On next timer, everybody batphones everyone, and blueballs happens one more time. 
---
I'm not sure what I hate more: this shit or 10% tidi slugfest.
---
it was "nano" online, ishtar+vaga
---
Ya, we got shit on by SkillU Eagles. Turns out they are really great against Stukas and Feroxes :P
---
Btw, are Unspoken / Hawks blue to Skill Urself?
---
Instead of jump cloning you should move your jita alts into Test and pretend to have numbers. Saves the JC.
---
disgusting
---
It's more of a hobby than a game.
---
I'd say it's pretty safe... Its not going anywhere
---
good stuff. thx for helping out with the bombers bar fleet yesterday therabois and gals. o7
---
No, the ishtar came way later than vaga online, if you want to get picky it was vaga+crow online.
---
It’s still related to the question? Isn’t this a forum to discuss things not to specifically answer questions?
---
&gt;if it weren't for that thing that you brought because of capital cap boosters and 3200s, our ships equipped with capital cap boosters and 3200s would have been fine
---
[What I've had success with](https://i.imgur.com/8jUWTqJ.png)
---
Also, streamlabs is easier to use, but is a heavier program. So if you're running up against the limits of your hardware, it could require a downgrade in output quality.
---
Phages doing more work.
---
nvenc is always going to look terrible compared to properly configured x264. Check out [this post](https://superuser.com/questions/490683/cheat-sheets-and-presets-settings-that-actually-work-with-ffmpeg-1-0). If you're recording in 4K 5000 kbps is a bit low, should be fine for 1080p. Main thing is x264 preset, veryfast is the sane default for streaming, faster or medium will look light years better if your CPU can take it. Allowing variable bitrate will help a lot too.
---
I dont think a keepstar is killable in highsec in 10% tidi. The dps requirements are just too high.
---
Malc, it's time to stop
---
Unfortunately that was always the big risk with dropping the Keepstar in Perimeter. People are going to want to haze it, and you're going to have to respond to every single armor timer since it dictates whether services stay up. It's balanced in a way, but I have no doubts it's getting increasingly annoying.
---
The only thing that makes me happier than large artillery alpha is capital artillery alpha. 
---
I sure hope someone is taking good care of my howitzer now that I am retired.
---
Holy sht
---
So after an embarrassing series of rorqual feeds, all mining is temporarily put on halt in Esoteria. Consequences are already starting to show...
---
apparently there is a default setting in obs that scales your output to 720p separately from the recording settings that I was unaware of
---
hopefully having fixed that will be enough
---
How do you do the retexturing? Substance painter or something way different?   
---
Accent colors face by face?

Thanks!

Galmil is dead as shit.
---
About a year ago the great war had goons steamrolling up north. That kind of switched focus for galmil to go hit the center of the warzone. Calmil esp bloc and templis were getting dicked and had to batphone all the time. They decided to pull the plug after eha(we captured eha finally, but i think they never broke down fort bloc). Calmil was gone. Out. Nothing. Was green as shit out there.
---
After that (which is when i actually had a break too!) I think fedup moved to pureblind, and roy joined rdraw with blfox. Rdraw and snuff basically shit on that and fedup moved south litteraly on the other side of new eden from black rise and placid.
---
Since then i think theres rando calmil corps, GMVA, and snuff/rdraw down there. Thats fw now. Dead as dirt
---
Riperoni
---
Maybe he died?
---
Well if he's not out in another 15 he's never comin' out so at least you got that going for you.
---
For some ships like the rokh, I allready have textures. Idk from where, but iirc there was a pack download in the eve online forums.
---
The wyvern is made procedural with the help of a baked AO map.
---
And then there is also some overpainting in Photoshop.
---
Didnt tryed substance painter for the models yet, because I never did real closeups. The models are lowpoly anyway
---
At least it's worse for PH. They usually get pinged a couple times to join the fleet, then burn over to Perimeter only to dock up and drive home in their pods. And loosing all their Azbels.
---
And if we're lucky NC and PL undock to help them find their balls and we actually get a fight.
---
by any chance are you from belgium ?
---
Was listening in on PH comms during and they seemed to be having lots of fun just knowing we showed up for nothing while roqs died :/
---
that doesnt mean your fax fit isn't absolute dogshit
---
This is an amazing video - it's what EVE is all about.
---
I remember so many moments like this one from my days pirating in lowsec. 
---
Man, so many awesome memories came flooding back to me when I watched this.

It's been a rough and busy time recently... thanks for brightening up my Monday &lt;3

Bot moral has always been zero. Bot morale, on the other hand...

That would solve the problem i guess...

This is what I got last time from a wormhole, I stole a Fortizar in their faces, they stopped and restarted unanchoring and I came out with this.

Cool story, bro. Should come to WH space more often. You see people doing retarded shit like this all the time. Its right up there with station containers out in the middle of nowhere. I found almost 10b worth of shit creating BMs for two hours between celestials for that one. Grats on the ezpz loot:)
---
Shame we had a good dynamic going w calmil back then
---
Now this is cringe posting

I’m here all the time.

Hadn’t heard about a Keepstar in Perimeter.
---
12% . pffffff.
---
Pure Savage, I love it!
---
/r/contageouslaughter
---
I was wondering about that.  Was it the rorqual feeds?  I know we've lost a couple, or was it something cumulative?
---
I don't mine, I also work a bunch so I can't play like I used to :-(
---
Underestimating EVE players ability to kill unkillable stuff is never a good bet.
---
So .. much .. aggression.
---
Yes........................YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!
---
Banderlogs everywhere!
---
Fuckoff the ship is good maybe slightly overpowered but it’s refreshing to have something so good not geared towards blob warfare and capitals
---
I heard someone on comms mention that filament traces remain visible well after who's inside came out. Can't confirm myself tho.
---
I was a marine too. You should be used to it, devil.

is it possible that he is doing abyssal pvp, and its a kitey no-break fest? or do pvp sites have a timer now?

yeh 20 minutes,

yeah think its a bug because mine stay out there for a a bit once ive left
---
Yeah it was the embarrassing number of rorqual kills yesterday. That and all of the ships lost during the saves.
---
I remember that 1EO-OE fight. One of the rare occasions we got to use our capitals in that war. I still have that carrier somewhere and can't believe we managed to get all our caps out before the bubbles went up.

We got farmed and we had to learn. You guys will have to do the same but we arent over extended tho so probably gotta figure something diffrent out.

Wow. Just wow. :D 
---
I will pay much more attention to structures from now on. It's just crazy what shiny tings people leave unattended in space.
---
Makes 5 bil an hour. Pretty solid!
---
Very nice, also massive attack +1
---
I've only just started, you fool
---
You need 150k dps to keep a Keepstar paused in tidi. That's nearly a full fleet of Oracles doing nothing but shooting the structure while you need additional help to deal with hostiles.
---
If you can't form at least 3 full fleets - for both timers, in the defender's timezone - that seems unreasonable.

Rorq's get nerfed then die to groups hunting newly nerfed Rorq's SHOCKING!!!! Need a FOX news alert.

Yay we made it!
---
Look mom I’m on Reddit!
---
If anything the carrier application nerf hit harder than the rorqual nerf, now there's no more one-size-fits-all solution to subcaps dicking on your rorqs.
---
That isn't how it works. They've confirmed damage caps are reduced proportional to the ti-di experienced.

Oh right, you mean someone might try and petition CCP about it because they want to try and make some nuclear drama about it. I mean it's kind of wasted effort regardless of the outcome in my case, because I don't play these days but hey if it makes you happy and you don't care about wasting already scarce GM resources, go for it. Who knows, if enough of you do it, you may even badger so me noob GM interested banning me for long enough that I actually notice if I ever resub.
---
We are usually always having fun
---
Please, just don't haul all of your livelihood in your freshly skilled freighter. That sounds like a perma rage quit after your visit of niarja/uedama.
---
IF I remember correctly test lost around 30 rorqs in eso in the past week.
---
You can spend a day looking for structures and either find them unanchoring or already unanchored, probably find one already unanchored every day, if you cover all of high sec, and covering each system in every region.
---
Oh cool, when did they add that? :O
---
Remote rep sac with only one utility slot ? 
---
Sounds weird ^^
---
It seems to be indeed what you say. Gonna report it anyways hope they will fix it
---
It's going straight into the bloodstream. You have to consider the fact that the oral bioavailability of spodumain is only around 12% to being with
---
Inclusive “or” is an option, I hope.
---
we stole around 8b of planetary products (mainly P1) from a wh where the citadels was bashed but not fully looted. we bring back the stuff in our home hole (several millions m^3) and gave it to our industrialist guy saying "hey, build something sellable with it". He's in deep depression since...
---
I believe recently you're losing less rorqs than test is.
---
HAW dread online. Carriers and supers are kinda bad compared to what they were but haw dreads give players the same risk free 1 v 15 gameplay they really crave ;)
---
dude, he is either dead or alive and ,trust me,  you DO NOT WANT to face that thing that could live through Abyssal destruct-timer and keeps gate open
---
Its the schrodinger gila
---
terrible job and ccp is batshit insane?
---
i mean, it's not like the csm can really change that much
---
Yeah, whole " lol, we made them jump clone here" attitude. Whatever spins their boat.
---
Use the in game bug report tool for sure.
---
You win the thread

Imagine actually having to not krab because your space daddy tols you to.

This is the funniest shit I've seen in a while
---
This happens for way over a year... but u get used to it quickly. didnt complain anytime anywhere. but maybe i can get some free skill points :thonking:
---
No they are not ?

Either lying or blind.

Citation pls.

---
Dude. Seriously. I don’t know everything that goes on in that place.
---
I’m not making it up. I never make stuff up in EVE. Everybody has their story. Mine is not as storied as others, but I do have my story.
---
I had completely missed the presence of a Keepstar [and I understand how silly it sounds] in Perimeter.
---
Why would I say that if it wasn’t true? Why would I make that up? Where is my win in that situation?
---
As backup fc in that fight and the guy who called for drake navies this guy is spot on.
---
Can we call what PL's got left that didn't jump to skill u a fleet?
---
You don't have to imagine, because FRT had done the same thing in the not too distant past.
---
Come to Stain, work for Sansha!
---
Spod is a helluva drug. If it might reform some heavy krabs, it might be worth it. Of course it would be better if they hadn't fed, and had functioning brain in the first place, but here we are now.
---
Also, for some reason, not saying the man is innocent, a lot of people just blindly take CCP at their word and assume their evidence against Brisc is 'good,' despite CCPs continued lack of transparency and its long history of making, what turned out to be, the wrong call and banned innocent people in the past. 
---
These so called people, who are taking the word of a company that literally tried to hide the fact that a developer was a member of a null sec alliance and had cheated by spawning some tech 2 bpos once are so damn gullible.
---
iirc, we switch our main DPS shield from Gila to DNI after a small brawl in your home month ago
---
Some of the most engaging content I had was skirmishing with those diamond rats duel boxing a wolf and a zealot.    And a couple of times I almost lost my pixels.    In fact I prefer this to abyss in terms of difficulty.
---
It keeps working! Look past the flare my dude. It's triggering.
---
ty
---
Late to the party but theres also War of Ascension. (Yes its trash but it's officially an EVE spinnoff)
---
Your rent feeds the Red Donut. Please contact Sadus for rent in my blue donut if you don't want to get shot by goons.
---
Of course not, low sec can't get anything nice.
---
Oh that was a fun fight!
---
I don't know how to approach it.    
---
You mixed Saint , Kuvakei and dinos.        
---
I am happy that you are one of the believers but what the hell dinos?
---
Help me doctor, it hurts when I do this!
---
\*Gates super through Wicked Creek*
---
Don't hide behind flair baiting then.
---
Whatever the case, I'm sure whatever shit tier group your actually part of has eithet shut down rorqs at some point, or are renters, because it's not completely uncommon.
---
What's really shocking is that a world beating 0.0 powerhouse like TAPI can't fend of a few messy ganks from a bunch of washed up has beens like Pandemonium Legion and We From Voltage or whoever those Bomber Boys are.
---
They would like you to move to Period Basis, where the same shit will happen to you in a different place.
---
Every has the better map layout tho as it preserves relative distances
---
First he died, now he dead.
---
And we’re the good guys.
---
&gt; Frat keep putting up 0.0% killmails to feed them though
---
FTFY
---
Dude, br.inyour.space looks good but is broken, okey?
---
love you too
---
Since the fuck when? Are you actually retarded?
---
but baited enough tests so they could not save roq
---
guess the guy in the site was able to magically stay there longer then
---
A C2 runner? Never thought about that. Got a fit?
---
Thanks, fixed it.
---
Ever since the dions of TEST Alliance have become endemic in the region, they have been hard at work culling the weak of Sansha Kuvakei's flock. In return, he blesses them with ample bounty payouts, completing the circle. 
---
For this he was granted sainthood by the Church of Sapporo Jones, with the recently founded clinic for spoducranial illnesses being named in his honor.
---
Imagine no1 knowing who the fuck you are and having only your flair to go by.
---
no.
---
Hyper can seem to get away from drones and all the times he feels he was mistreated.  Poor dude needs some help...
---
Test loose more than an azbel is worth each time one goes up
---
You can try a packet tracker. Eve is really touchy about lost packets.. Like if a few are missing your booted no questions asked.
---
Happens to me Alot.. Some days I cant even get all three online before it shits out.
---
But ccp is really the only one that can help afaik.. Assuming your internet is fine.
---
Awesome, thanks
---
Show us where the Kiki touched you
---
Imagine being so gullable you feel safe awesoming flair is not bait.
---
so do you solo pvp all the time or do gay shit?
---
For someone reason old Northern Associates rent income vanished, you know from the age when NA was used to rent half of EVE.
---
It's precisely because of this sort of reaction that flair baiting is a thing. Welcome to EvE. I don't play in large blocs nor do I contribute to the Rorqual menace, but keep grasping here spodbrain.
---
The things you own end up owning you.
---
killed a structure in hisec a while back....
---
it didnt drop but a large MJD copy was on the mail. along with the large mjd unit dropped (guess the build had completed just didnt press accept?)
---
&gt;I don't play in large blocs 
---
I too shove my unwanted, shit tier opinion into conversations I'm completely irrelevant in under the guise of being part of an alliance I probably can't get in to.
---
But you know, call me spodbrain and it's all ok.
---
sit retard
---
You and a few buddies should put together some rocket herons, go into a c1 to c3 wh, pretend you are hacking, and then gang up. Combat Herons are no joke.
---
Imagine being an attention seeking faggot that role plays a chinky in his spare time
---
isnt nergal a translation from one of the abyssal site system names.
---
if you translate the triglavian lettering from the system names (can be found on loss mails)
---
i swear one of the areas was nergal, and i think im hearing nergal said as a ship name nowadays?
---
hmmm wonder if theres some secrets hidden in that triglavian wording that i cant be bother to decipher.
---
anyone up for the challenge
---
Unfortunately I don't see it written directly anywhere, I see multiple references towards something CCP Falcon said during the 9-4 siege on Twitch so I guess when I get home later I'll have to dig for that. I remember a ton of hurf blurf surrounding that at the time which is when he made a clarifying statement, I assume.
---
But the way it is suppose to work is that if you are in 10% tidi, you have to do 10% dps real-time, which amounts to no actual difference in dps in game-time.
---
cyno alt, hauler alt, scout, pvp dude, jita alt
---
Depends on what you are doing. For me, i got my main pvp. Got my neutral hauler / industrial / miner. Then i got my scouter / ECM bitch.
---
20 minutes for the site, 20 minutes for the first timer and then another 20 for the fight iirc.
---
So he either died and the abyss trace didnt close or he had 5 minutes longer.
---
Subcaps
---
Huehuehue
---
That's interesting I didn't know that!, I know that nergal is one name for the Mesopotamian god of destruction. I believe the Gallente will be building the nergal. As all t2 TRI ships are being developed by each empire race. So possible explosive weakness?
---
:D.... Not far from my estimate
---
presume explosive weakness 
---
most factions that deal one type choice. resist against thier own damage type more than anything else.
---
and i think trig stuff is explo therm?
---
Only plex is being sold through those though. Since they don't have to be transported to a new citadel and just go into the Plex vault. Injectors and other things are primarily being traded in the keepstar.
---
Www lad you're quite the spicy boi. Now, I said I don't play in large blocs. Does that mean I haven't? Does it even mean that I haven't recently? Does that mean I've never had Rorquals? No, and you wonder why you're called a spodbrain.
---
Also, fuck you you miserable clod. I can voice my opinion in whatever dod damn conversation on this subreddit I want to. I, unlike you, do not need permission from my overlords you insolent prick.
---
There have been suggestions that CCP are listening to the CSM less and less, sadly. So it's not for a lack of trying, methinks.
---
Hey, be nice to PL: they can probably marginally out form eve uni still.
---
Says the guy at the keyboard, still RPing having hands
---
Are you familiar with card games like MTG? There's a concept called "strictly worse". If something is strictly worse than something else, it is worse in every way. When you ask if armor tanking is "objectively worse" than shield tanking, it sounds like you're asking if armor tanking is strictly worse than shield tanking, and it isn't. Having all your tank in low slots can let you mitigate damage with ECM or things, or let you fit utility modules that help you kill your target faster, meaning you take less damage. Killing your enemy quicker is a form of tanking. So armor tanking is not objectively worse than shield tanking. They're just different forms of tanking and will be useful in different scenarios.
---
I never understood why Test has so many of the most bitter-exes.
---
Sure, you used to be in a block, but for some reason; you got bored, got kicked, whatever, now you probably don't even log in.  Or maybe you hide in a worm hole or whatever.
---
Whatever. Now you're just another Test bitter-ex, perfectly content to just follow our Reddit threads around and chip in your two cents even thought you've done absolutely fuck all to earn the right to smug.
---
So yeah, I'm sorry about whatever Test did to touch your fe-fes, and I'm glad that your enjoying our current struggles.  I hope that whenever I leave Test (if I do, which I doubt), I can manage to find something better to do with my time then bitter-ex Test threads.
---
Didn't they blow up some banking towers at the end of that story?
---
Nice!
---
Yeah I remember the first time I visited one of those sites in my heron because I was curious. I got alpha'd into structure before I warped off. So depending on the ship he was flying, he might have only been lagged out for a second or so.
---
Brad Pitt was not the originator of this idea....
---
&gt;  If anything the carrier application nerf hit harder than the rorqual nerf
---
Serious question: do carriers even have a role now? They're not very useful against other caps, can't rep anymore, and now can't apply to subs. Are they meant to be Anti-fighters/drones only?
---
Angry?  There isn't an ounce of hostility in my post.  Perhaps you are mistaking me calling you an idiot to be anger.  One can easily think your ideas are stupid without being angry.
---
I did that arc in a gnosis recently so BCs are definitely possible. Not sure about bigger ships.
---
I've heard it is explo/therm. In all honesty I want it to be a retribution with more dps haha. I know that's silly and not likely.
---
Must.... explode.... towers....
---
Nice blog and great wh story. I love to read these types of adventures. It's happened to me a handfull of times including finding offlined poses.
---
I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.
---
It did.
---
Its almost like drone sites spawn in all regions of space....
---
This is how I ask for killmails from now on.
---

---

You fucker.

"Life here began out there."
---
she's also bending all the gneiss
---
What's a thanny?
---
Dang I misread. For a moment I thought the multiboxing spodbrains switched to multiboxing entire incursion fleets like that one guy who boxes a full fleet of 40 in highsec.
---
This is all 100% speculation, but the impression I get is that we might have slightly underestimated the effects of the carrier nerfs, and slightly over estimated our response ability with the majority of the alliance in Immensea.
---
So basically the stand down is to give leadership some time to figure out an effective save strategy that is going to have to be more complicated then "jump all the supers".
---
Basically, it looks like the nerf is working as intended, and unfortunately Test are the ones who ended up demonstrating that.
---
Again, this is 100% my speculation based on almost no facts.
---

I was under the impression the boost you get from using them is minuscule compared to the boost the NSA gives, making them mostly pointless.

That's called a \`Thanatos'.

I think I know your friend and who he is flying for.
---
To get into EVE, you just have to play the game.
---
Yes
---
retty is already pretty strong on tank/dps/range
---
i presume is will be 150-300dps spooled, but be limited on actual tank, proberly fast instead of tanky
---
You can override the music to eve classic or something similar in the settings
---
Fair point, I suppose I should’ve said “on paper,” as I was referring to raw paper numbers for EHP/s
---
but, why 0 velocity?
---
Objectively as in paper EHP/s rep numbers. Of course, that’s not how you think when actually fitting a ship
---
Please send Mirana Bal'ari an ingame mail to negotiate rent pricing, she's a much better negotiator than Sadus.
---
if you mix it whit a pony ?       
---
Than~~athosp~~ny
---
It has to be something completely cancerous to fight though.  As fun as Rorq saves might be, we have other shit in other parts of Eve to do, so it's in our best interests that people don't feel like they can come get gee effs by shooting Rorqs
---
Personally, I think we should use some sort of booshing doctrine.

That would be wild. I said it had been a while and couldn't remember the name of his clan. He mentioned stripping entire belts and then splitting everything at the end based on ship and time invested.

I'm considering checking it out, but there are so many similarities to Albion and I already play and love Albion, so we'll see. I know my friends are super into space, though, and we really liked Elite: Dangerous.

RETIRED from Eve. The sun is amazing when you spend alotta time outside in it 😆

Didn't say anything against that. Was more a "why they keep feeding Azbels"

but but... why does it stay there to be locked or? Did he think he can tank 3 battleships ? I don't get it

Exactly this should be self evident to you that you have lost focus and need to repent.

Yeah, as of right now the only thing they don't suck at is SS fighters.

Have you spoken your Eternal truth to them yet. If the answer is no then get to work son.
---
Harpies. Theyve been BNI's default response and work really well. In sufficient numbers they shit on kikis and bombers. Anything bigger like BC and above they struggle with, but that would get eaten by carriers. 
---
Really they only leave HAC fleets uncovered but those are rare.
---
Truth is important when dealing with other humans. You can stretch it, bend it, but never break it like claiming you are something when you are not. Because then you are caught in a lie.....right?
---
Their DPS still isn't to be laughed at, they outrange every other cap, and will absolutely shit on anything bigger than a BC application wise.
---
They just cant deal with frigates, dessies, and low sig cruisers anymore.
---
Please keep your shoulder to the wheel.
---
You know nothing Jack Cactus. You...know...nothing.
---
Yeah, except that we made Test pay for forming. And there will be more of that in the future I bet based on the success. A perimeter fight is going to mean 'dock everything up' for Test. Or we'll go smack a low power structure sotoyo if everything is docked.
---
Wait son no movies for you get back to the work.
---
I have a Stratios I use for low/high sec combat sites. As I primary use drones, is it generally worth it to have any weapons on? I will post more details and the fit if necessary.
---
Because Test didn't shut the fuck up about it for months and smugposts about it filled the front page for at least the first 3 weeks it went up. 
---
So, you're either lying that you're here all the time, or you're blind.
---
How much do you have to spend, what's your drone and missiles skills? I would recommend that you stick to T4 until your feel comfortable with it. This guide was a godsend to me. https://newedenreport.com/2019/01/08/fit-for-purpose-t4-abyss-gila-edition/
---
I also recommend watching EVE streamers doing it for some insight. Erschlag have some good fits on his ingame channel.

No you're on a mission in central russia.

Hurry and finish your mission and you can take an economics class. They will explain why.

turned out to be friendly dreads otherwise we would have

Do at your weekly mission meeting do your get competitive with your stats. I always found that repugnant.?
---
&gt;  and will absolutely shit on anything bigger than a BC application wise.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; They just cant deal with frigates, dessies, and low sig cruisers anymore.
---
If Hurricane or RR BS fleets come back into fashion, I'd be happy (although I'd probably be in them rather than attacking them). As it is now, the people most likely to be be shooting at are either in caps or small shit that the carrier struggles against.
---
Anytime :D
---
I guess they're also good at suitcasing ships around.
---
I thought I remembered that, looked it up, then checked and saw you posted this.  Found a page with some card pics as well with that wonderful early Eve art https://alchetron.com/Eve:-The-Second-Genesis
---
You can Krab all you want you just don't have Alliance to help you for 24 hours you can do whatever you want
---
&lt;3 it! Looks amazing :)
---
I have had this issue multiple times this past weekend. Closing/reopening the scan window resets it.
---
There was this one instance yesterday, before i realized what was happening, that i was on the verge of a breakdown.
---
I had this guy in a 5 degree cone, at precisely 6.6 au and my 0.5 probe cluster was coming up empty every time.  Rage was had.
---
"Is it possible that my dscan is desynced?"
---
Yes, apparently thats a thing now.
---
The comms had me smiling IRL haha
---
No one sees a Harpy fleet and thinks " man, I need to get out of here before I get rectal herpies".  AFs are actually fun to fight.
---
It doesn't have to be particularly good, just cancer to fight.
---
BBTB is using them to annoy Olmeca, but no one else in goons thinks about it much
---
I like to remind you that Elite dangerous and Albion are nothing alike each other, just as EVE is a completely different game than Albion/Elite dangerous.
---
I've played albion myself for a good 4 to 5 months but I didn't like it, I've tried multiple classes but it just didn't grab me as much.
---
People are replying like you're some crazy tinfoil hat doomsayer. Meanwhile i remember the good ol' pvp days as a brand new pleb in high sec, full of content, miners ready to defend their shitty veldspard can with a PVP cruiser in a nearby station, Arnon running an everflowing stream of killmails, and wardecs being affordable for 1-5 man noob corps. The culture of old days teached new player to harden up, plot revenge, carefuly study your fitting options and curbstomping the fucker that killed you a week ago. 
---
Now the joy of solo and small gang on newbs is so rare, cause the new culture is to avoid risk at any cost, most go from HS straight to Nullbear land, not thats anything wrong with 0.0, but skipping the whole learning process and being a drone on a F1 fleet and think thats the peak of the game, now thats sad.
---
You disgust me, and exemplify everything wrong with this game.
---
Empire builder, BTW.
---
Bruh, this sub went from 108k to 109k last week.

---
Uh, wat?
---
&gt; What does a returning capsuleer need to know to make it in New Eden these days?
---
You probably will have to relearn a lot.
---
&gt; Is missioning still decent?
---
Yes depending on what you're talking as "missioning". But overall, running anomalies in NS or WH is just far less bothersome.
---
&gt; Is my old ninja salvager still viable?
---
Yeah no not really.
---
&gt; What's the best path to getting back into nullsec play, and is it worth it for someone that lacks political ties now? So many questions and not enough time to list them all.
---
Just apply to any corp that takes new bro (aka half of null sec) and read all the things they have prepared to babysit you.
---
&gt; I ran with Eve-Uni for a while back in the days of Saber-A, would it be worth it to return or would I be better off joining up with a purpose driven Corp?
---
If you want to be taught, go and join Eve Uni, but learning on the fly with corp mate to explain what you need is probably the most enjoyable part.
---
By comparison I like this link: https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99003581/ship/41030/losses/ not bad for an alliance that only mines 12hrs a day
---
I run this kind of fit since 1 year, you have a very, very bad tank. A good BS will tank more (no joke). Sometimes you need to repair at a citadel after 4 anom and you need help (rep) for killing a dread. if you warp at 100km i think you dont need to rep but you loose the money given by the drop of the mtu.
---
I feel the change of the nerf just a little bit for the damage application.
---
For PvE get a Gila, it pulls way more dps than a Stratios.
---
You see Stratius rolebonus don't really favour PvE, if you're going for the usual PvE slot layout with lowslots damage and shieldtank you have a weird Armor Role Bonus wich indicates more of a PvP usage with Armortank and Midslot PvP Modules.
---
You have no damage Bonus besides Drones and your Turrets get an optimal range modifier. I've seen PvE Strats wich use Projectile Turrets to not damage-type lock themself on EM &amp; Therm since it does not matter wich Turrets you use...
---
On top of that you have different Boni to Scanning, CovOps etc.  
---
So if you scan down Anomalies in High.sec you use 4 Turrets and one utility high for the Proble Launcher. Gilas also have an utility highslot tbh and roughly 30% more damage even with shitfits.
---
Yeah, it is a little weird - you have local reps too. The lack of overwhelming reps adds to the fun, or ends it if you screw up a trigger.
---
Do they drop anything worth farming? Or is it just smart to make them your friends and harass people
---
He didn't think he'd get alpha'd of the field.
---
Hyperions are usually brawlers.
---
so, you can recreate it by simply completing an incursion site?
---
cheapest t5 gila i found was like 5bn or so using mid grades and thats kinda sketch.
---
Blatant lie! CCP didnt touch FW in years and its cold stale mess.
---
Use Sisi for testing purposes. It's literally a test server. Ask someone in your corp/alliance for some filaments to start it, they aren't seeded there.
---
then u deff shouldnt be doing t5
---
if you havent played for a while, it may have lagged out while it downloaded new models for the structures, etc. You have the option in the launcher to download all the data all at once, or download data as it is needed. when i had a lower bandwidth connection, it was quite noticeable when it was trying to download new models.
---
to be fair, i think thats the idea.
---
make you jump clone, to burn the clone while stuff goes in nullsec.  if you focus nullsec. we reinforce.
---
if you don't, nullsec reinforces.
---
either way, you get blueballed(or feel like you did),  and somewhere you get hit.
---
When is the last time an Nc/Pl rorqual died?
---
i still havent figured it out. if they were going 1ms it would have completely missed lmao. Best guess is they were in dock range and didn't think the nag could hit that far. so they were gonna sit and wait till the rorqs tried to get them and then dock.
---
And Machs online

command destroyers have a 6k aoe "move 100km that way" modual. micro jumpfield generator. Warp Scramblers are supposed to shut it off.

Yup, every single time after completion. I can do whatever I want if I dont complete the site.

 [https://zkillboard.com/character/2114826024/](https://zkillboard.com/character/2114826024/)  it makes you think :o
---
I reported a persistent trace quite a few months ago that I sat on in disappointment for about 30 minutes.  Sadly, the traces persisting even after the timer has expired is just one more reason why they're not usually worth pursing. I'm still at a loss for why CCP removed the criminal flag from high level sites.
---
But think of all that money you are saving for piggles, Villy, and Saporo!  Because of your effort and the income from highsec structures, these fine gentlemen and one fat fingered slob don't have to spend real money ordering people around!
---
I’m blind.
---
I see TEST posting all the time, but I associate Keepstars with 0.0.
---
Entirely possible :D
---
I mean his hype was a pretty standard blaster fit, but they still volley for 5100 damage (each) with Void. He sat there at 0 velocity like "they can't volley through my pith Bs lol nerds"... his fit has 22.3k EHP against void, so of course he got two-volleyd.
---
Its almost like there is a pattern of misconduct....

I'm sure all big null sec alliances fund Omega for their FCs, leadership, spies and such. At least we can afford to SRP ships lost in fights unlike some "newbean friendly" alliance.

So pretty! Love it.

My "obstinate" viewpoint is that the people charged with making that kind of decision had no issue with it when it happened, because it was beyond trivial in scope. The one who is laughing here is me, at all these twits chimping out at the actual definition of a trivial technical infraction, which occurred half a decade ago.
---
It was 100% predictable, and, as hoped it has diverted the outrage machine for a little while as well as giving me an evening of mild entertainment at their expense.
---
Never!

Jump in jam a rorqual cant panic n dead quick

I'd be fine with that.

What's with all the goon on goon kills?

Flair baiting is retarded and doubly so if you're not famous enough for anyone to know who you are.
---
I hope those POSes had some modules with nice things in it?
---
While this is something I personally would enjoy, this is not a good idea:
---
Mobility bonus? Really? Capitals are supposed to be slow/stationary.  This is why we have siege modes, triage core, industrial core (btw I agree with NSA nerf).
---
Second, you could argue that cap ewar vs subcaps I'd not broken by means of ratio.  This doesn't hold for all cases. Example: Minmatar ewar cap would partner with Phoenix and would be OP.
---
I do agree that ewar should affect capitals in siege mode, but adding ewar caps raises balance concerns that I cannot address.
---
Lastly, and unrelated to the subject of this post but in line with everyone else here, I disapprove of your practice of posting every stray thought without supporting arguments, potential ramifications, or whether it's worthwhile.
---
Thanks for reading.

&gt; we might lose more than an azbel worth when we fight for them
---
If that is true then redalert's post is correct, isn't it?
---
Not quite, there was a very large group of nc/phorde supposedly going to turn up, but they ran into the other imperium fleets that were also heading to the sotiyo. It looked like a very bloody brawl, so it was probably a lot of fun.
---
Several months ago TEST anchored the "Tranquility Trading Tower" in Perimeter with a very low tax. Intending to attract a relevant percentage of Jita trade volume to earn bazillions of ISK.
---
Was big news and created a lot of hubbub on this subreddit for weeks.
---
Pilot logistics is a valid tactic if you're fighting an actual war rather than looking for gfs. And the best part of it is that eventually TEST won't bother jump cloning to Perimeter and then one day you can actually shoot the objective too.
---
Due to lightweight components it wud have much mass as other caps. An instead of a armor or shield tank would use speed to keep distance.
---
Ochre first or else.
---
no, its still there
---
Fantastic!
---
Yeah we need ewar titans... in fact I bet Goons already have 400 of them built
---
wait BoT has moral?
---
&gt;  For instance when I was on the CSM, I was told about the Crius changes (no more remote research), and promptly researched up some BPOs that I owned but hadn't bothered doing anything with.
---
That is absolutely 'abusing the NDA' and while it is now long in the past and the advantage you gained was fairly small scale, so I wouldn't be getting the torch and pitchfork out, it does make you much less credible as a defender of your alliance mates if you think this - and presumably therefore also what they are supposed to have done - is okay.
---
Here is what happened. We saw you camping the entrance to the site, so we had the person inside use the Olmeca Gold Avoidance CCP Batphone, and had the GM (goonmaster) move the person to 1DQ1-A.
---
i remember when FW was fun and awesome, back in the starting days of templis and co vs galmil
---
il always remember that one dude, lorren gallen 
---
grr
---
Not sure its been fixed.
---
If you are being camped (and your friends have told you this).  You can just kill everything in the room, go to the centre and control space the ship.  Disconnect the client and then log back in... timer is gone.. now go afk.
---
May have been fixed... but i doubt it.
---
Lol what? TEST is telling people to not Rorqual mine right now?
---
test is shit
---
Yes let's bring cancer ECM to capital, the last thing Eve needs !
---
outch the first fight !
---
Wud help kill csps fasyer or save em
---
This was happening to me a lot yesterday, but I was doing a lot of Exploration Sites, not Incursions.
---
Reading you admitting to using information you gained as a CSM for personal gain and trying to hand wave it away is awesome after your years of high and mighty bullshit.
---
Thanks, hopefully this is the nail in the joke that is the CSMs coffin.
---
No it would not.
---
Its discord
---
Duh, everyone knows that (because Mar5meca Gold says so) us goons have CCP GM (goonmaster) bat phones. So when one of us is being camped in an abyssal site, we can just get CCP to move us!
---
If it is true it should be considered a bug exploit ? Doesnt it
---
anytjing ccp tries to do ends in failure, ie all their apinn off games and eve portal on mobile
---
Prove me wrong
---
We've got plenty of guides on how to fit your Rorq and how to not die like this.
---
But there's people out there who are sure that they know better.
---
BOT and the dronelands have generally always been rental areas (or loosely connected blue alliances, see DRF).  They make good targets for droppers or small gang pvp as there isn't a capital umbrella and almost never a response fleet (also intel kinda sucks).   Logistics of the dronelands is also kinda a pain so it isn't a great empire building location. 
---
Nobody really wants the area so nobody really tries to take it over.  Last time it fliipped it basically went from one rental empire XIX to another SkillU.  Unspoken / Laser doesn't seem to really want to run an rental empire (maybe?) so they will probably continue to burn it down until they get bored as help really isn't on the way.
---
HAW dreads + support?
---
Its still there
---
What we really need is capital booshers so we can start blinking supers around the grid.

when I started in 2007 veto was the pinnacle of piracy and people were as scared when they saw veto in some lowsec local, a little like Snuff today ...
---
well you think spawning an ESS in a fully spawn site is an exploit... who am I to judge.
---
What's the use case for it ?
---
Dread bomb ? A dread would be more useful and polyvalent, triage gets kill fast enough anyway if you have overwhelming number and if you don't, well triage is the focus and you're useless anyway. 
---
Defending against a dread bomb or any other cap fight situation ? You would get focused really fast and die while a dread would have had more tank and be more useful.
---
Not taking into account ECM is a cancer mechanic nobody likes.
---
Your sec status isn't affected if you only engage enemy militia pilots.
---
I genuinely don't understand this narrative. Now, I haven't fought for PH in a while, but when I did, it felt like almost every strat-op had handouts available. I know SRP was available for some things, but I was almost always fighting with PH ships. I'm not sure how extensive this actually is, but I'd rather fight with a handout ship than apply for SRP after I lose something. Less work for me. Am I missing something here?
---
You got free VNIs?
---
Do your own thing op. I am working on the same project currently. The key is to figure out fracking timers.

Nice try PA...

"Sure but it's not getting SRPd"
---
More effort next time, shit bait is shit
---
Ask HK about unkillable keepstar.
---
Those were recently added, probably due to citadel interiors being moved to CCP's Space Object Factory system
---
Who is your ISP, and are you using the router they provided or your own?
---
ISPs own router can sometime cause problems with internet.
---
Someones mad they didnt get in on the great plex rush of 2019!!!
---
So if we have established that CCP are able to view non-harm breaches through a lens of significance and severity, why then do you think that Brisc, Dark Shines, and Pando, who have clearly passed through the same objective lens of consideration?  
---
After all, if CCP's stance was that minor breaches will not be punished, the 'highly likely' scenario in your mind, surely they wouldn't have been banned?  
---
Or, in the alternative, if CCP takes a hardline stance on minor breaches, then surely you would also have been banned?  
---
Or maybe, just maybe, you refuse to look at the evidence objectively because of your proximity and affiliation with the banned subjects?  
---
Is the problem CCP, then, or is the problem you not viewing the matter objectively?
---
Not surprised he was wrong.
---
Keep it in the DL, don't need anyone else banned because of Brisc letting us know about EWAR capitals
---
That is not how that works and he never discussed that as a feature in the game. In the current system, you have to bring more in proportion to the tidi.
---
Should just use a rorqual
---
There have been few changes to anything that you mention in your post. Overall, for the things you mention, I'd judge them to be slightly worse than 18 months ago.
---
* FW specifically and low-sec generally are still in very poor shape.
---
* The Community team has added a couple of people but lost CCP Guard.
---
* The Pearl Abyss buy-out has been kept pretty quiet but the last PvE event in EVE included a version of BDO-style loot boxes.

I would be in favor of it, as it counters fax in subcap fleets and small cap fleets, but for balance concerns noted elsewhere.

It’s EVE. EVE never changes much, overall.
---
Hey jester! Your videos really helped me when I was getting started.
---
Sucks to hear about fw still being unloved, is it still relatively active?
---
Have they done anything about the awful state of botters that existed back then?
---
You saw right through it, bro!
---
I dont play anymore so surely the game is doing better

Good to hear about cap and rorq nerfs. Those were sorely needed.
---
So amarr mil and galmil are the two underdogs right now? Wild. Is DnG still doing dumb shit down in amarr lowsec?
---
Too bad about VNIs, that was a viable way for newer players to make isk, have they added better ways to make money without farming or basically afk ratting?

Sucks that guard left though, but I hope he's well.

Kicked for inactivity? Sounds like NC is about to lose about 50% of its members.

Great video report that is to the point! I would like to mention that Panfam aided winterco with a large force as well for both timers.

Does my service in the Shadoo First armor have brigade exempt me from this moveop by military service?
---
PL has been visiting Eso quite a bit, moneys on there
---
The 'wut?' implied it. If you agree then we're all in agreement and everything is fine.
---
In addition to all the other responses here, armor tanking is also much lighter on cap use. It's easier to have a cap stable armor tank.
---
The other 50% won't be kicked as the relevant leadership is inactive.
---
I'm getting Gehi vibes
---
It's been like that forever. The bitter exes after the fall of test mk1 were obnoxious as fuck.

Not really sure Legacy should be throwing stones on the "dictating when and where their members can krab" front, considering you guys forced all your pets to move to Immensea to keep those ADMs up.
---
Because it's a pulsar and they're fit like dogshit. Pulsar Bhaals work, but not the way they did them, soon as they get neuted out they practically get volleyed by that many drakes firing mjolnir rage. Though it looks like half the fleet was firing the wrong damage type, it could've been over a lot faster.
---
 Did NC.  ever defend their renters? Ofcourse they going somewhere else

Look for fits you see a lot of. Good fits die all the time and they will be similiar. The one-off fits be careful of.

The first time I'd ever seen a super fleet was when NC dropped the hammer during a subcap fight in Provi (or was it Catch - can't remember).  We were led by Jin'taan and flying Nightmares.  I remember thinking it was amazing to see, even though my Nightmare bought a ticket onto Zkill.  
---
Since then I joined Goons and NC's supercap fleet seems kind-of small.
---
A lot of the mid tier large wh corps use them. Odin, POSPY, and WHSOC off the top of my head.
---
I’m somewhat new, been exploring in an Astero having a blast. I am wondering if the Stratios is capable or clearing C1-3 WH data/relic sites (“forgotten..”, etc). I know they spawn rats on entrance. I seem to find more of these sites than the ones that do not spawn rats. Are other ships more capable for this task? Do I have to scan all these down and come back in another ship to do them?
---
I swear this is the same message PH got...
---
&gt; So if we have established that CCP are able to view non-harm breaches through a lens of significance and severity, why then do you think that Brisc, Dark Shines, and Pando, who have clearly passed through the same objective lens of consideration, have been wrongly punished?
---
If you follow the thread back up to the top, you can see I was speculating about the implications of the difference between a 1y and a permanent ban, that the 1y might mean "this looks real bad but we can't definitely prove it", in which case there'd be scope for Dark and Pando to present an alternative interpretation. And I provided examples from my own direct experience to support that hypothesis that there's a spectrum of response from indifference to the utterly trivial (researching some BPOs in a station now rather than in a POS later) to the potentially game-breaking eg: Larkgate (moon mineral buying), Ankhgate (giving CCP's dev strategy to her game company employers), and whatever it was that Manny did (presumably feeding NDA information to NCPL leadership.)
---
(And then of course the chimp house, to whom nuance is equivalent to pedophile rape, and feels mean facts, ran with it.)
---
Well get a bot and shut up then.
---
Wouldn't EAC stand for Electronic Assault Cruiser? So basically EWAR focused HAC using the EWAR T1 hull as the base?
---
You're pretty judgemental for a tax evader.
---
&gt; and the advantage you gained was fairly small scale
---
Would you like to try and quantify it?

Related kills include 4 PL cyno jammers thingy. So that might just have been clever grid management.

Pretty much the same as a year and a half ago, drekyavics are pretty neat in small fleets. Local issues have been the source of funny antics , they fix some things and break others , you know how it goes.

---
Could you? Yes. Should you? No not unless you really want to. The isk value of those sites are not in the cans but in the blue loot that the rats drop. A strat can do some low class wh stuff for sure but your far better off doing it in a gila. My recommendation is for now just keep exploring in your astero. Get real comfortable in it. Then consider joining a wh corp if you really like this game play. At that point you will have better knowledge and hopefully proper guidance and support to step into wh ratting.
---
The SMAs had a lot of ships. I think we got just under 10bil of stuff that one time. Recently we found a Standup Market Hub1 in some containers left from an unanchored citadel. Gotta love WHs!!!
---
how long did it take
---
Yeah, that doesnt help from mobile.
---
Nobody is saying it's fair or dishonorable, I'm saying it's a boring one sided mechanic. It wouldn't counter FAX in small fleet because if someone put a FAX on a small fleet he is basically begging for you to drop it and has a counter to it. So you're just going to die very fast and feed.
---
As a new player, I would not recommend trying wormhole PvE combat in a stratios (at least a battlecruiser). But if you tank up, C1s should be doable as a start, but you'll be doing them quite slowly. The difficulty of rats ramp up very quickly when you head into higher class wormholes. Before you try a site, look it up on a guide such as the EveUni website to see how much DPS the enemies do, and assess whether or not you can tank it.
---
Also just as an aside it's pretty fucking hilarious that the group that accused Pandemic Legion of cheating in the tournament by using perfectly acceptable methods of Intel gathering, turned out to be actually cheating.
---
Not once, but twice. Thanks for brightening up an old man's day.
---
But say he didn't get alpha'd and only got into low structure, then what? It's not like he would win the fight or anything right?
---
Maybe, but that's a bit simplistic.
---
I'm saying that you can fly what you want, but don't spend more than you earn on something.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/76199418/ is my cringe worthy point:
---
That legion lasted maybe 5 minutes from undock to space debris. I could replace it immediately but I'd have to spend ages earning back the isk. If I hadn't bought the damn thing to begin with I'd be able to plex today.
---
I should have been more aware of how much *effort* replacing it would have been, and then perhaps I wouldn't have bought it.
---
Or, if you look through my kill board, the message might be:
---
"git gud fuck face"
---
Free ships all day erryday
---
Even if they go to Branch?
---
Ouch, RIP
---
You won't hear it from me at the moment. It's a hard lesson to learn. Losing a ship sucks. I hope you are able to replace it quickly!
---
Catering to foreign markets and losing touch with the player base that elevated you to greatness is a valid fear that many players have. Power and wealth have brought many developers to madness, waste, and ruin.
---
Can't argue that!
---
But I've never been able to blow up a ship with a RaR.

Though to be fair, I've never had much luck blowing up ships at all.

Still haven't really felt it. If they had nerfed DPS, it might have been RIP in pieces, but as it stands, I have lost precisely one drone in abyss so far, and this is routinely running 4s with an occasional 5 when I feel froggy.
---
And if nothing else, you can carry TEN drones total, so you can literally have NPCs exclusively target them somehow and lose 8 and still have the full complement of two on the field.
---
oh plenty of people got it
---
really?
---
Whore drones my friend, (some people may look down on you for this) we had a guy have 3 killmarks on his basi before it met its end.
---
Yeah we really have some talented people flying in our space against solos, cant really help you there :D
---
inb4 they deploy to defend renters haha.
---
Thank you! Its a great project to work on
---
How else would you get volleyed by capital artillery?
---
Sound the invasion horn!
---
That's a shitty effort Vince.
---
I'm coming back with a Rattle, if you could line up and let me shoot you one by one?
---
Seriously though, I head out there because if I'm going to get the shit kicked out of me, I'm also going to learn something.
---
This truly is a game for masochist isn't it?
---
I generally keep my poop in my lower intestine when I'm not using it, not my butt. Maybe you should wipe.
---
Don't scare me like that, I thought Odin's Call was disbanding or something &gt;_&lt;
---
Who put the dick on the moon in Jita 4-4?
---
That is the only thing we've never done.
---
hahaha, sad thing about this game is thats its running so long now, the trolling is getting boring, i need some good burns. Also whut most ppl said in here does also aply to the rest off eve. Even Brave and Horde are bitter now, we need a new Brave.
---
Also im recruiting !!!
---
it's fine
---
not sure why you skipped over introductions, would have been good for context before barrelling into content
---
some incorrect information around game mechanics - there is no interaction between locking a target and that target being able to tether for example
---
images of what you're talking about would be cool, like when you talk about systems and stagings would be nice to have them up on the screen
---
overall i liked it because i like hearing what other people think about eve
---
i think you would benefit from having a guest of some kind as you're both kind of the host/inquirer as opposed to the expert/leader or whatever
---
Well a rattle is a very juicy target and attracts alot of attention, if you just took out a cheap frigate you'll more likely get a fight your looking for
---
Oh ya. Those guys fuck.
---
Nothing in that article mentioned botting. If you are referring to the Asian practice of  "ifyou aren't botting you are getting left behind" then you should link that context with this article.
---
Joining someone else other than Goons you might have a chance to drop your super cap on something other than a T1 frig or a Keepstar!
---
any sources on this?
---
Didn’t this already get deleted once?
---
Which shit-show of an alliance are you a member of, I wonder.
---
+10 for imagination, -10 for dumb idea
---
I have to ask, how do you like the sock talk and taylor swift memes?
---
You mean like the Keepstar in X47?
---
Lol.  "Red light"
---
You're welcome.
---
Someone can copy paste the text? Impossible to read on phone. Thx
---
And we are still in hakonen :)
---
v nice
---
That would be very ironic wow hehe!
---
People see the dreadbomb coming a mile away if it's Delve.  It gets pinged for before it drops.  Fountain is happier hunting for that I think.
---
FOCUS ON GOKU FLEET NOT FUCKING REDDIT IDIOT

Y'all cleared the tackle. Why'd you run at the end?

FC is on Reddit, what do?
---
P A N I C 
---
aAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

What's the unpopular opinion? Are you saying it's good or that that's just the case

So THIS is why we're waiting.....

"You all have phones, right?"

Nc. is finaly killing the leftovers from PL and taking the title of "king of the north" /s
---
If they rescind the umbrella won't that just mean that the Rorq pilots who don't read pings will die leading to yet another embarrassing series of rorqual feeds
---
Galmil is not really that upset about having Calmil win, though, because they have been stocking up on LP and are just waiting for VNI prices to spike. 
---
I think DnG is still alive, but I'm not really sure what shape they're in, I just know they exist.
---
For new players exploration is by far the best way to make isk, but people do VNIs anyway because its a lot less effort.
---
If only there was a lowsec gate there so more entities could pile into Stain...
---
this is a pretty terrible video, honestly
---
cyno pov and then it's a super pov with a bad overview + unfiltered broadcasts
---
3rd hand footage just tried to throw something together. Dont expect great feedback just wanted to share what I did.
---
ping pong is the new Eve meta.
---
I disagree, I'm sure I'd meet the same number of BCs and T3s looking to instablap me. I'll visit with a few smaller ships, definitely. I hate frigate combat though. I want some epic BS vs BS slugging match, lasers illuminating the black void and hybrid ammo slamming into creaking armour plates. Fabled, epic combat that ends with a burning hulk and a resounding clarion call of glory.
---
But I'll bring some Frigs and we'll all pew pew soon 😉
---
Botters are hard to say how much they're doing. They're definetely banning them, and they've also started taking back all botted isk, even if it was paid up into corp or alliance wallets. However, telling if its getting worse, or better, or staying about the same is impossible beyond just speculation
---
Just waiting for test to show us their massive TQ indust tower
---
Well its not on the potatoe mode then.
---
When they were, before.
---
Those small things made it feel at least not so alone and added some ambient atmosphere.
---
[BR here](https://zkillboard.com/related/30004035/201904132100/)
---
You are so active that we have forgotten that you are there
---
Actually I thought he'd jump gate.
---
25 hurricanes does something like 100k alpha with close range ammo. Which is enough to one shot us.
---
why
---
botting isn't the issue
---
The thing is, if someone sees a rattle reported in intel, not only do they want that on their killboard, they also know its probably going to be bling fit, so you can make a profit while killing it too. So, you'll have everything from newer players in ramjags to t3cs trying to get kills chasing after you until you're dead.
---
If you take a tech 3 destroyer, or assault frigate, then no one is really going to bother chasing it unless they're just bored, or you're harassing their miners/ratters. You're also able to disengage from combat pretty easily with a sniping t3d or assault frig, allthough a brawl fit t3d will be in a harder spot.
---
oof
---
I'm going to file this under "funny, but too soon"
---
Oof indeed
---
i am betting we are taking our annual visit to play with Initiative.
---
oh cmon its already almost extinguished
---
really what?
---
Thanks for the feedback Cap_Qu, appreciated!
---
Yes. Stay liquid, you guys! Or split the hauls up.
---
Or just don't be like me and do courier contracts haha
---
I think having a freighter will be more useful to some of the other guys more than me.
---
)))))))
---
I love how the out of focus logo starts out of focus. 
---
get it? cause the name of the..of the corp is...and the logo.
---
hah.
---
Atleast the music was also terrible to make up for it :]
---
And how would they track you without any webs or tackle?
---
downvoted cus anti-test
---
...sure? I said Keepstars. You can't tell me you actually LIKE using your titan in fights like those?
---
he meant /s
---
Awesome thanks for the reply! Ya a neat tool!!
---
Albion and Eve are incredibly similar.
---
what
---
like all deployments without supers in the age of citadels?   
---
Its more fun than krabbing, it doesn't mean you have to evict the ones you deploy against for it to be a success
---
They would defend renters? lol. my money is on fucking with Init like Init tried to do up north.
---
He is trying to KillahBee faction titan meme. Badly.
---
30k alliance makes 4k alliance seem small. hmmmmmm
---
nice, will you actually undock this time?
---
Something something goons and pets focusing all their effort on small non English speaking renter corps within BOT for "content" then stroking epeen on reddit.
---
BUT IS ELO THE BEST FC IN THE GAME RIGHT NOW?  IS HE?  IS HE?  OR IS IT VILY?  BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO KNOW AND REPEAT OVER THE WHOLE INTERVIEW
---
Yea and we only have 2 brains and have to share them
---
Fun xrawing :)
---
I remember that fight, that was lots of fun. Also the last fun fight Brave ever provided.
---
Why didn’t u kill the rag ? :(
---
Fuck NC. Always.
---
News at 11 and water is wet
---
Sorry mate but neither Elo nor Vily is the best FC no matter how many times you try to milk that.  Sister Bliss is above both.
---
Goons and pets are focusing their attacks on easy targets like small non English speaking renters in drone lands then shit posting on reddit about it.
---
It's the new strategy since their main FC's got banned.
---
they just provided a really good one for us now, https://br.inyour.space/?s=1162&amp;b=8566260&amp;e=90&amp;t=svb
---
&gt; Now if anyone is making isk donations
---
I thought about this but than I remembered some wise advise, 
---
&gt; to not spend more than you earn
---
Since I don't slave for isk I earned only some billions and thus cannot donate.
---
Our interests seemed aligned for a while there
---
I thought it was a dart board.
---
&gt; If you want to do the other regions, you’ll need to know how to use mwd + cloak to escape from a bubble gatecamp. 
---
So I'm a bit confused on this. I was caught in a warp bubble while going gate to gate (lesson learned - gate -&gt; random planet -&gt; gate from now on) and I was completely immobilized immediately.
---
personally I enjoy all the free kills
---
Common misconception! The dart board with blind fold is unreliable due to darts causing damage to the wall. Turns out darts while blindfolded is hard. Who knew
---
I got my 1 KM thalia blown up. It was a rough day
---
No the answer is not have them under NDA but CCP is a business we cant expect that.
---
Stuff like that is really special
---
Come onnn gaming "journalism" is at its peak!
---
Goan git farked
---
I blame the extremely exhausting conference for my poor decision to pass out on the couch instead of responding to pings.
---
Well if you can't afford to spend it, don't! 🤣
---
Lets face it, if I have so little shame that I'd link my kb, I'm not above pleading poverty!
---
The wall could be where we are meant to go
---
Lol according to most on this site that is only like 2 hours of game play to replace lol
---
Finally NC. will be able to make a new AT advert of a move fleet.
---
Fap Fap Fap. :) hey nice ship
---
Not really I just think most claims of 100 isk per hour is fairly fake.
---
Common practice among multiple groups is to pull titan alts for dread numbers. The skills are cross applicable and it can give you quite a few more dreads in fleet.
---
I can't see shit on mobile
---
And then when you start losing you don't have to bother telling everyone to dock up for muh BR
---
Oh nice one
---
Nothing.
---
But if you get tackled, there won't be an alliance level save.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if some dudes get saved at the corp level though.
---
brain do work
---
Downvote cuz no battle reports
---
i'm a noob, so who won? Did the Dreadbomb get destroyed?
---
if it isn't coming from /u/stainguy i don't trust any news that is stain related.
---
NSH and LSH are still shit, if that helps :)
---
Attractiveness of char sonic can get more free shit
---
Yeeeeeeeah... I'm 4 chars deep, 3 mining, the other derpy herpy all over the place getting shot to pieces and thats not been my experience.
---
I can make perhaps 60mil an hour?
---
Reactions seem to hate me, I almost always run at a loss or break even.
---
PI is a fuck ton of aggravation.
---
Soooo yeah, I'd love a fleet of rorqs out rock sucking, but I'm not about to spend over a bil per char and all that time to get them into one.
---
And I'm talking full on krabbing here, sucking the best rocks and proper boosts and skills and shit. 60 mil. Plexing is worse, it would take forever to pay off an Ishtar, assuming it isn't gang ganked.
---
Honestly? The only thing that seems that is may have a chance of working is the idea of not spending isk.
---
what is below trash tier? asking for a friend in test.
---
That's some cool stuff
---
Wait, wouldn't deploying mean they actually have to undock?
---
Eat my asshole.
---
Some of my best fleets were flying with TNT, glad you guys are still kicking bums out of sleeping bags.
---
Playing the market in this game is not difficult. You can make hand over fist more isk in Jita 4-4 than anywhere else in this game.
---
Thank you for your input.
---
How long would it take you to replace the isk you'll spend on that?
---
Yeah, it'd be nice.  There is the generic warp in point but unfortunately about 80% of athanors are inactive (not pulling a chunk) or pulling a chunk but there isnt a way to see how far along it is.  Plus, I try to be respectful if a corpie asks me to not mine although it's a waste as I have a hard time imagining a 4 man Corp stripping a belt in 2 days.
---
Another old timer beat me to it
---
Back in my day, all we had were nano Vagabonds, and we like it.
---
Market buy to market sell? I always thought that required micromanaging prices, the eternal 0.01 war?
---
The only bubble that shuts off a mwd is a HIC scram. Fortunately, those are not very common at all, because they have a very short range and HICs aren’t cheap. 
---
What happens if you go gate to gate is people have lots of cans and drones dropped by the front of the bubble, so you get decloaked when you land, and you get locked up and screamed as soon as you land. However, doing this all around the gate is not allowed, so you don’t have to worry about it when jumping a gate, just when getting caught by bubbles.  
---
The trick is just using mwd and cloak in the same tick to get away from the spot you decloaked at so none of the campers can just burn within 2km of you for a decloak
---
Yeah, I get that. Has anyone else done this?
---
Which faction should I join for faction warfare and why?
---
Good stuff. It's fun to see rare ships flying and fast moving lazor use makes me happy. Thanks for sharing o7
---
Nah. They just jump clone.
---
&gt; The trick is just using mwd and cloak in the same tick
---
I tried that trick and had practiced it, but my clock was cooling off for 10 seconds so I was locked before I could do anything.
---
Getting a lot of replies saying it's my GPU. Well darn.
---
Yeah, the persecution complex is strong with this one. The lack of self-awareness it takes to think that the alliance with the highest amount of and the loudest reddit participants in the game has roving bands of bitter-exes frothing up every TEST thread out of spite rather than it being an effect of having the most amount of posters is just astounding.
---
Good stuff. Damn that Marshal moment was spicy... gaming chair stuck in clenched buttcheeks, pls halp.
---
Wow. Worked fabulously, thanks. I'm still gonna get my GPU checked out, though, better safe than sorry ;)
---
Because you have to justify the manhours you've put into it and if an arbritary setting (Abyssal L4 &amp; L5 = suspect) makes it that majority of people interested in them are afraid to = won't run them, then it'll look very bad on the customer engangement spreadsheets in the next quarterly meeting about New Content™
---
I want to buy a cheap laptop for $150 or less to play eve on (possibly through Linux) could anyone make a suggestion for a good/cost efficient on board gpu that is Linux compatible?
---
Good joke comimg from NCdock :D
---
We eventually got home from the Op and jumpcloned to Q just in time to see the 2nd nyx go down.
---
I'd advise to take a look into Gurista and Sansha Null.sec!
---
Some Months ago there was a [Summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/af7536/the_ultimate_nullsec_faction_relicdata_sites/) wich Relic and Data sites pay the most, imo its not even worth fitting a Data Analyzer tbh and there are several people who'd agree with me there but thats open for discussion.
---
J.space is not as safe as Null.sec (with local and all) and its way harder to navigate there! In Null you have fixed gates and can travel between Systems without loosing time.
---
In WH you have random anomalies and sometimes several Bloodraider or other lesser valuable sites after another, Goonswarm have farmed them into Oblivion since they own Delve and other Bloodraider space and the Loot has long lost its worth. In J.space you also have guarded Driver sites too.
---
If you scan and hack in Null you only get your paying sites and have less stuggle traveling through systems and some safety from local.
---
Its worth a try! Maximize your ISK/hour! If you're farming, farm intelligent! Don't waste time farming worthless shit!
---
I just dropped my own athanor and it went live last night.  I'm pulling my first chunk now.  Gneiss and Crok.  The total worth of the chunk is around 400mil but I know i wont mine it all myself.  As long as I make enough for fuel I'm good, plus it will feed my t2 machine.  Lol
---
holy shit that first song was fire.

---
dino tier
---
Oh, right, that was probably the plan.
---
they had a good fight and BRAVE had enough time get a cyno in position and Faxes ready. NSers tend to roll of the WH entrance in situations like this. Not a bad call to leave. These NS static WHler fleets only work in a gank scenario or smallish fleet engagements. Not against a NS alliance formup
---
I peed, pooped and cried a little... not in that order
---
Can’t leave the Spod unattended...
---
About 3 clicks of the random button
---
Yep
---
Look into gallante. Last I heard they actually had some sov null sec.
---
Awesome thank you!
---
How many killmarks you sitting on?
---
Thinking of playing around with making eve fan art in blender, how did you get the textures? I see only 3d models in the repository.
---
Yeah. Like I said, if you get decloaked when pulled into a drag bubble, you’re screwed. Only way to avoid that is to not land in one in the first place. 
---
The trick is for if you jump a gate and find a Sabre waiting for you on the other side
---
I got them from 0 to \~20 I think, but it's sold now, sadly it wasn't mine.

Downvoted for downvoting.

But you’d have to dock up the rorq to log on the alpha. Pshhhh
---
I've literally never cheated ar EVE, sorry to shit on your Hope's and dreams but after all your bluster, it was in the end you that cheated, not us.
---
The best part about you fall into the mud here is your attempts to justify your cheating. Its fucking priceless Malcanis
---
I got it out everything is fine now
---
Ha I love that guy
---
Boob size is best
---
Nice... where at??  I totally won’t show up n steal any...
---
INIT response fleet showed up, just as the second Super was bosoned.
---
None of that makes you any less of a bitter-ex.
---
You should really get over it.  I'm sure you're better off without us.
---
They say npc fountain is a beautiful sight during spring.
---
Fair enough! 
---
I haven’t played much lately so I was curious. I’m still just taking things at face value. So seeing a small hurricane fleet like that with a single recon just seems so juicy. 
---
I hadn’t really considered the situation about reds rolling the hole or more obviously a bajillion fax coming in.
---
C is my hope too😉
---
Choppakadawa !
---
That was surprisingly well done
---
I thought the China server shut down...?
---
I guess I misjudged you. More fool me for thinking you were slightly more grown up than this - I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
---
This was already posted 2 hours ago

botting is only a problem because of local
---
remove local and you can consistently hunt botters
---
Detroit is a shithole anyways, not sure why youd want IHUBs there.

Infiltrators have been among us for some time. They are but the vanguard.

Heat map recorded at notre dame
---
Assuming the devs weren't already mad when they started to work for CCP
---
Why is that a shit fit?
---
That's... the joke John.
---
Yeah, it's definitely the persecution of the poor non-english speaking groups and definitely nothing at all to do with the fact that B0T is an over-inflated balloon easily popped with fucking morons like Pantsufan there as their "defense". Like, I'm not sure what barrel NC. was scraping to find him in again, but I honestly didn't think there was any z-tier FC's left in the game.
---
Why would you exclude no effect?
---
Well no one will hand you a living...but you could take a toon and make him a market toon...train up the skills needed and leave it in Jita. Then open a new slot on that account and repeat for an amarr toon. Only need to check them every 15-30min and update orders. Makes bank for me...and with the right skills you can be anywhere in the region and still update orders...while you afk mine in a quiet highsec pocket.
---
Because if it's included - will be hard to see anything else. Here is data for c3 as example:

Wolf-RayetStar	387
---
Magnetar	393

I'm not directly involved, not being in FW myself, but these three threads are probably quite relevant:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/98n8cg/the_blocs_withdrawal_from_the_caldari_militia/
---

---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ap5gyd/current_status_of_caldari_militia_we_need_to_pay/
---
CCP has been announcing quarterly actions against botting, including barring Alpha accounts from L4 missions as of the March patch, and twice reducing the spawn rate of null-sec anomalies but I kind of get the impression that these are holding actions rather than something that is really turning the tide. Watch /r/eve for even a few days, and you'll see multiple threads giving good evidence of continued heavy-duty botting particularly in null-sec anoms.
---
I didn’t realize that imperium had re-joined the war with legacy? When you refer to “Imperial Legacy” that’s the reference to imperium and Legacy coalitions joint ops like as was last year.  
---
As far as I know goons are mainly coming over for content but the war is primarily between Fraternity/winter co and TEST/Legacy Co.  
---
But I could be on spod so vOv
---
👌
---
Nah, it just makes you clearly more of an idiot than even I thought. Now we need to come up with a name for when a spodbrain and a dinobrain isn't enough to properly determine the lack of brain cells a player has.
---
Is this why 1DQ has been on fire for the past 6 months?
---
Even just delay when people appear in local and you can catch bots reliably
---
I don't really have any tips for dotlan, but lately I've been using this instead.
---
[https://eveeye.com/](https://eveeye.com/)
---
similar info to dotlan, a cleaner ui, will track you, set destination, some other neat tricks
---
Upvoting just for Phil Collins
---
When panfam show up in force, goons tend to also show up. At that point we're essentially repeating the battle lines of last summer so there's nothing wrong with bringing those coalition names up.
---
Imperium have not officialy joined the war, but when Imperium forces help Legacy like they did in these engagments we tend to call them Imperial Legacy.
---
Brudude, the golden age of small gang and subcaps is once again upon us.
---
I'd try looking for a used one - you'll probably get a much better used one than a new one at that price point.
---
I like this group. I was off probing in a nullsec region and couldn't find connections that were useful for me, but I did happen to find their wormhole system and a ratting nyx. I Told them about it, and within 1/2 an hr there is a dead carrier on their kb, as they presumably couldn't get the nyx but still managed to make cool things happen.
---
I get pissed off because the heels on women's boots aren't big enough.
---
&gt;simil
---
I don't agree, the way intelligence is done is not similar, large scale battles are nothing compared to EVE and you're playing on a flat 2d plane, not utilising any flight tactics or whatsoever, the combat mechanics are completely different.
---
EVE is alot more in depth while Albion may be inspired by EVE, is alot more simplified.
---
In EVE you're not obliged to grind for your skills, in Albion you are.
---
Albion is alot more small-gang warfare inclined with small skirmishes all around, there are no groundbreaking or recording breaking battles (not that they are fun on EVE anyhow) happening in the game.
---
Fair enough, good stuff
---
Poop is stored in the butt.   
---
It is known.
---
The route to Init is entirely clogged with shredded NDA's. You'll need to go somewhere else this year.
---
Ahhhahaha the joke.
---
just remove it
---
Urd you could have also called it My Romance and used Bill Evans Version https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-xXgzrVZcA
---
Hopefully it's not a brisc deployment.
---
Rumour has it StainGuy doesn't actually live in Stain any more.
---
StainGuy, say it ain't true!
---
imgur and mobile don't always play nice
---
Don’t cut yourself short, I asked for this.
---
Maybe not directly, but I assumed my mouth vibrations ended up adjusting the causality of the current plane of existence and subtlety pushed you towards making this.
---
Or maybe because I asked for it in a reddit comment. Who knows?
---
Well there are facts and there is spin.
---
Not a repeat from [2006 or 2012](https://www.eveonline.com/article/the-new-era-of-serenity-1), confirm/deny?
---
I pay 110m a month to not have to worry about that. :)
---
You have friends?
---
Yes... and your point is..? 
---
If you're rorq mining and don't read your pings then you shouldn't be rorq mining lel
---
You know what to do.
---
It could work if CCP actually banned botters on a reasonable scale which they don't.
---
You haven't provided enough information, I don't know what BPOs you put in research, how many there were or how remote they were from where you decided to research them. But I guess the advantage is the amount of time you saved by not having to fly around to where the BPOs were stored, probably an hour or two? so a couple of hundred million if you would have done something else with the time.
---
And policed RMT, and had enough GMs to handle the people already playing let alone the people they'd gain from trying to market to china
---
he hasnt lived in stain for a few years
---
having a few alts in stain != living in stain
---
Yeah if only they would stick with their traditional white male nerds everything would so be much better.
---
*HURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR*
---
Your point is largely correct but it's "core tenets".
---
The only real clue is when you spot a swarm of orcas and integrated mining drones on a moon.  Far as i know, there is no way to pin down an unattended belt without physically visiting each in turn.
---
Ran into this last night actually in a 0.5 system.  Looking for someone on dscan.  Found 5-6 orcas and about 7 billion isk worth of drones in space.  One even had a full flight of Harvester drones, which is always worth a look.
---
It was all guys from one alliance, chewing Spod off a moon.
---

Helping your fleetmates blow up ships is as satisfying.

So every body in China will either be committed to Diablo Immortal and Blizzards upcoming parade of mobile games marketed specifically for Chinese or Eve Online.

Most of the rorq pilots were dumb fucks and deserved to die.

I want to start up an easy to manage, small network of alts that would be able to generate enough isk through mining and manufacturing in nullsec or W-space to be more efficient than outright spending the $15 monthly subs on buying /selling plex. I plan on being able to play 2-3 hours a day or 15-20 a week. 
---
My main has 28m SP and is steering towards a small gang support pvp playstyle and I'm thinking about making or including a boost account and/or orca pilot to support pvp ops as well
---
I'd like to start new alts from scratch and don't mind spending a few months of training without any return. What I really need is some direction on hoto set this up.  I  only have experience as a F1 bean. 
---
Sounds enticing. Can I get to lowsec from there?

No, he's worried about his tenants.

Looking at the autogenerated BR it was a minor test victory,  51b to 58b. Maybe a bit better then that counting battleship insurance being better then HAC insurance and holding grid meaning some decent loot.

Generally, yes. In the days before skill injectors and citadels, titan pilots usually started as dread pilots. Mine certainly did.

The problems as I'm aware (from the leadership meeting) was that people are getting complacent and lazy, plus there are some really shitfit rorquals.  Its unfortunate we've reached the point where we had to literally write a manual on how to rorqual, but it needed to be done.

Currently I'm managing a little over 200ish orders and it takes me all of 5 minutes to update them. Do that once or twice a day and you are golden. Minimal effort for maximum profit.

You're not a freedom fighter. You're an idiot. Most of the corporations IN B0T are not native English speakers. You're not railing against some fucking conspiracy against non-english speakers.
---
To clarify. It is simply buying low and selling high. What things you do that with is up to you and your market research.

It's really like 3 skill books to go from dread to Titan, so there's no reason not to if you have Titan money.

I know I was on a save yesterday, my first one in ages, where a Rorq and a Nid were lost.

where can you see those data ? The number of wh with effect per class ?
---
Hmm, cool! What trends do you see?
---
Definitely didn't ask for all these pie-charts. 
---
*shudder*
---
That's not accurate... there's only about 2500 wormholes in eve.

Would be even better if that person plays and is one of them...

Lol, yea, you cheated, and now other members of your alliance have as well, look at that apple bounce baby!

Also after all the shit you cocksuckers have cried about for years accusing everybody and their brother of cheating (without ever having any actual evidence) you're shocked that people (like me) are here to roast your shit?

Hey Squishy, Nice to see another post from you. This is great content, clearly you are having a blast doing what you always do. Hope to see you around Deklein sometime soon again. O/
---
We were definitely debating about going for the rag for a second. Hindsight maths tells me we made the right decision though. Judging from my ship scans his fit probably has around 19m EHP with invulns on ([maybe something like this](https://i.imgur.com/0cRrIWb.png)). We had around 17,5k dps on the field. Even if we assume I was able to neut his invulns off intermittently and take a hypthetical *effective* EHP of 13m (lowballing it?), that's still 12,3 mins to kill him -- all this assuming he gets zero reps. We know, however, that he has a shield repping ninazu on grid. 
---
Even just killing the fax and the shield Nyx (combined EHP approx. 7m) we barely got out before the defense fleet arrived (approx. 10 mins from Titan landing on field until def fleet arrives). If we had gone for the titan, I don't see any way we could have killed it.
---
On the other hand, the defense fleet had only 1 Bhaal that I could see. Possibly we could have blapped that and gotten under their guns. But then, who knows what would have dropped on us next, now that the hive was stirred.
---

I wish I had the isk to buy my own Imp, never had over 10b on my wallet, at least I won a Tiamat last AT and have some rich corpmates that don't care :)

Those are number of killmails, not number of unique wormholes.

Great, well thanks for your help!!

Heroes don't lose the will to protect by the venom of villains.  They lose the will to serve because of the voice of the people.
---
And people wonder while I don't like civilization.
---
This is not number of wh with effect per class, but you can find data you are looking for on anoik.is. There's filters and stuff.
---
I’d love to see the ratio of number of kills on a said type of the system on the number the sauf system (ie maybe they’re only 20% of of C2-C2/LS by those represents only 10% of kills within c2)
---
Why the long point though? My understanding is that most players won't leave grid if they see an AT ship, usually because it may be their only chance to kill one.
---
It's a press release which is weird but I guess more formal to make a point.  Even if it appears a little passive aggressive.
---
Carrier nerf really hasnt done anything. 1 carrier will still kill an untackled blingy succ in 2 mwd cycles after the nerf.
---
Deff a goonie
---
Again they’re showing up for content.  They haven’t thrown in the war against frat/winter co.  Goons/imperium shoot horde everywhere.   That’s their own rivalry.
---
They aren’t as much “helping legacy” as they are looking for horde to kill.
---
I KNEW IT
---
I did not get what you meant.
---
% of kills in c2 with specific statics is shown in chart, but, I guess, you want something else?
---
I was actually surprised how often caps used in c2. I mean you do not expect it to be visible, but it is!
---
Sure, but in the end that helps Legacy.
---
Well yeah, Brad Pitt was the fake persona. Edward Norton was the real guy.

---
Of course, but shooting horde still helps Legacy especially in this case.
---
cheers
---
Tell you what when goons/imperium show up to ihub or structure timers I’ll agree it’s coordinated.   Right now they’re 3rd partying on horde.
---
It seems people shoot each other in wormhole. And often shooting happens in small-scale format. I like it :D
---
I always try to make mine look like people from tv or movies. I have one that’s doc holiday, data from Star Trek, vaas from far cry, and one that looks like Bruce Willis.
---
When they show up to a structure timer I’ll agree the help is coordinated.   Legacy is getting jabbed pretty good atm.
---
They are using it as their logo on facebook and their website. I'm sure goons have done the whole copyright thing on them right?
---
Thoughts and prayers.
---
brilliant video work btw CCP.
---
This is very cool, thanks for creating. Any chance this data goes back in time to the bad-good-old-days when you could pull staticmapper info and see when people were pve'ing in w-space? Would be interested to see if it moved more kills from Sat/Sun to M/Tu/We/Th.
---
Sorry for the Engrish ^^
---
I meant that maybe there is less c2-C2/LS than there is for exemple c2-HS hence the lower of kill.
---
So ratio such has (% of number of kills did on C2-C2/LS divided by the % of c2-C2/LS) would give a way to see the activity of certain type of system

And now for the gargantuan challenge of getting the ex renter shitfitters to actually read that manual.
---
You talking about normalization, I probably should normalize data for Statics and Effects, but I did not.
---
If you are really interested in this specific data - you can get my numbers from link(on the bottom of image) and just divide by amount of existing whs(with this specific static/effect, this data can be found on anoik.is).
---
You should message them on their quote form and just say World War Bee.
---
Nothing of valu....oh fuck!

Yep !

And perfect if there is way to get your data!

I’ll have a look a them tomorow :)

oh man, take the upvote, its not right, but.....

Hey guess what, they've shown up to ihub timers

Unfortunately no. Killmails is not so easy available in bulk, I can harass zkb-api to get them, but it'd not be nice. And I was after actual data.

Just start having corps kick people who don't fit their rorqs with the bare minimum equipment.  Or who mine when milcom has specifically said "we're busy and won't be saving rorqs, dock up".  There is a point where you can no longer save somebody from themselves.

This is great.  I mean, aside from just being every relevant statistic I could ask for, the presentation is beautiful.  Colors are easily distinguishable but still go together. Legends are helpful and well scaled.  Good visualization.
---
Looking at the hour chart, it might have been interesting to color code horizontally by time zones instead of the vertical rainbow, like AU, CN, RU, EU, US.
---
No this game sucks and you should return to what you were doing. Also.......wormholes are terrible. You must never go there to enjoy all of the dank ISK and small gang fights. That is all........
---
Oof, too soon :-(

Interior was saved, as well as several of the statues.

Damn shame about the rest, though

Yeah I just read 16 artefacts saved so there is that and the actual structure should be viable according to firefighters. I wanted to go see it next year or so and was starting to make plans so it’s a massive shame, not just for me but for everyone that has never been there.

Sorry to hear bout your plans.. you making any others to go and see something else?

TEST also has free ships for newbies. Ships that allow them to be useful in fights. Mostly tackle and ewar. Also ships to blow up in roams. Some basic PvE stuff too, like salvage corm or Ventures. Sometimes there are handouts as well, and something we are given new, fitted ship as SRP.
---
Believe or not, I used to fly in PH. Because Geminate is what it is, there constantly were home defense fleets. RLMS Caracals, Cormorants, sometimes Canes and Feroxes. Does that stuff gets SRP? It didn't, and I doubt they do it now. I'm not sure if they SRP Feroxes that sometimes blow up in Perimeter fights.
---
In TEST, vast majority of fleets have SRP, and fleet that don't, have handouts. They are usually also pretty fun. Just look at these Ravens:

&gt;Hey guys, I haven't played in maybe 18 months. I stopped playing when I got a new job that really took up all of my time, but now that I have more I'm wondering if it's worth getting back into the game. The last thing I did was take part in big cat fights out in the southeast I figure those are pretty died down by now.I'm not sure I want to get involved in a big no alliance again, what is the state of faction warfare? Which militias are stomping right now? Roughly what is the state of balance, is it as fucked as it's always been?  
---
&gt;one of the main reasons why I didn't come back after a short break was CCP being sold. How are the new owners? Is everything pay-to-win? Or do they have more of a soft touch. I really didn't like how CCP did their community team dirty, I really feel like that took away a lot of representation that the players had within the game. Has that been improved?  
---
&gt;I really enjoyed Eve for the roughly six years I played prior to this, but if it's not worth getting back into then I might as well move on. I'm a little pissed because I didn't realize that it was Auto charging my credit card every year and so I have several more months of paid subscription and I'm wondering if it would be worth getting back into. would I be able to get the skill points that I didn't spend training while I was paying but not playing?  
---
&gt;Anyways, I know the eve subreddit is relatively helpful. So thanks guys
---
For me it is slowly going down the drain. I'm seeing more and more actual people being replaced by accounts, either AFK, multiboxing or botting. Accoring to one of the recent AMAs there is an average of 1.6 accounts per playing player. Average logged in at prime times is 30k. this means on the 30k login roughly 1 out of 3 characters you run into in the game are not players. This gets much worse during off times as bots run 23.5/7 and do not need to log off. And all this I run into in the game and it kinda disgusts and disappoints me.
---
Last event they did was Guardian Gala and it was fucked up as well, technical issues and bugs aside, chanced lootboxes along with a multiboxing requirement if you want to complete the event and build accelerators. They basically made it impossible to switch ships or accounts. Pure fucking money grab to try to get newbs, carebears and people that just wanna do something different and break the monotony to make and sub or plex more accounts. I hope this is not an indication of future events and things to come, but I feel my hope slipping. It makes me sad because when they started doing these it was actually a lot of fun. They were decent profit, fights were sparking everywhere, even in HS over lootboxes etc. It was content in which a lot of players were participating regardless how old their characters were etc. Now these new ones are just bad.
---
The economy is all fucked up and skewed and there is just no way for you to compete unless you too multibox. Things which were optional in the past are now becoming "de facto" requirements, again kinda nauseating. 
---
Plex has for now stabilized and its sitting around 2 Bil for a month of Omega, until the next big jump. We will have at least a small jump coming up as some new content will be released in not too distant future and people will be activating their PvE accounts, but it might be big, time will tell.
---
CCP can't ban bots and is unwilling to make game changes to make them less effective. They recently closed off L4 missions to alphas cause of the botting really hurting new / alpha players in the process as 1 example. 
---
As for FW and LS in general, there are some spaces still left but very few. Small and mid sized corps and alliances are going extinct unless they become at least parts of coalitions so choices and outlook become bleak. The recent nerfs to caps help a bit but its a drop in the bucket as things will level off and stabilize. Not sure if CCP is willing to make more necessary changes in this regard.
---
The only positive thing I see is that the new line of Triglavian ships is fun to play and is based on more active then inactive play. These ships are just simply more engaging in combat itself then any of the other ones currently in Eve, and CCP is continuing to expand it. So this is the only step I see in the right direction.
---
Thank you. It's not rainbow, it's 'warmth' of hour) But you're right, timezones could be better option.
---
CCPlease, nerf Triglavians, because I am tempted to skill into them, and screw up my training schedule yet again.

I hear tell their logi didn't jump in until after the third lit cyno.
---
I know they hand out Cormorants pretty often, and I've gotten a few handout caracals, but that seemed to be on a more informal basis. I'm not sure about the canes and Feroxes, as I haven't really flown them much, but I will say that back when Horde's hisec ops were just about clearing Azbels, every ship we used was a handout. And most of the fun roams I've been on have either had handouts or the FC reimbursing you when you bought a ship off contracts. 
---
So sure, maybe TEST's SRP program is a little more extensive, but I don't think there's enough of a difference for the "horde has no srp" narrative to make much sense.
---
If player alliances can copyright their own logos without CCP saying nope to it, then its new info to me. 
---
Would be pretty neat.
