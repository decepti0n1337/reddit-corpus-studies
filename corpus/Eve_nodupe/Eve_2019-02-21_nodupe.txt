Just a bouncing ideas. Tldr: a nobody plays with ideas.
---
---
---
&gt; what does your typical day on eve look like ?  
---

---
I log in, whelp ~10 Thrashers, savagely jerk off if I manage to kill something expensive, then check in my industry alts and log off.
---
&gt; because all it takes is one side alt watching us
---
you mean like how marshy has one side alt in every system? How ironic, the mechanic being used isn't called unfair until its used against you....
---
Spin harder pls.
---
Exploration, but it is still waste of PvP time if you got no alt. :( For market PvP you'd need max trading skills and tens of billions liquid isk to play with.
---
Wonderful video, but in reality you just took some clips of random fleet, it's not the current deployment :(
---
Didn't PL join pandemic horde?
---
Read a ping earlier saying there is going to be a "jita burn" this weekend and all freighters regardless of type, will be destroyed. Possibly related?
---
For me the AT stopped being fun when I couldn't bet on it
---
1.  CCP isn't going to do this ever.  If something like this was on the table, injectors in their present form would not have been introduced.
---
2.  I don't know.  I'm tired of bots of too and all that, but there's definitely some misplaced anger there.  Anom rates, rorqual panic buttons, etc... all facilitate the fact that purely afk bots are a massive problem.
---
3.  Sure.
---
4.  Hisec is already an option in the game.  This game needs less arbitrary "meta adjusting" gimmicks, not more.
---
5.  T3's need a few more iterative balance passes on the whole.
---
6.  Of course.
---
7.  Sure.  Again.
---
8.  Of course.
---
9.  Of course.
---
10.  I don't even care about the launcher anymore.  I'd rather they prioritize everything else over it, and just let it be at this point.  It isn't great, but I can log into the game.
---
11.  Yes to boosters without blueprints.  No to the three sections.  The Mordu's event had that, and it was unpleasant at best.  One section, maybe a gate.  Let players engage each other instead of all branching into their own little domain.
---
Planetary interaction: you can do this with one account as a factory planet manager. Purchase P2 items (chiral structures and toxic metals)etc.. for cheap and use them to make p3-p4 items such as mechanical parts, robotics, coolant etc.. 
---
If you have multiple accounts then you can skip the middle man and extract in mass, process through factories and sell off the remaining materials. 
---
Minor hub marketing/manufacturing: go to a place like hek, dodixie, rens, tanoo, teonusude or anywhere really and build stuff to sell. Start small with Blue print copies and manufacture what that hub is missing. For instance, Hek was missing tristans and atrons. You wont be making bank right away but if you start off with 100mil you can easily grow. Start off by putting small amounts of finished items on the market so can free up isk quickly. Also ammo and drones sell like crazy in mission running hubs. 
---
Blue Print Copying: sell BPCs of anything. Certain ships and mids do sell more quickly than others and learning about your local or region market hubs are a must. Manufactures want to build stuff in bulk, researchers need t1 copies to create t2 BPCs, and PVPers or anyone with common sense prefer to move BPCs instead of BPOs. 
---
So yeah you have already said it. You want to find a corp*. Ask your self " fo I want to kill people?" Then find a corp that is in line with what you think you want to get into. And you can always find a new corp if you don't like what you get. o7 hood luck out there
---
even if they manage to loot it, the average goon still has to call somebody competent to come to their system and clear the mission for them. and the money and lp from the mission goes to you.
---
There's a difference between "station" and "citadel" in the current version of the game.
---
If your items are in NPC null (like Stain) in one of the old NPC stations, I don't believe asset safety is an option. That's a feature of player owned citadels. 
---
I heard those all got stolen, maybe the the guy who grabbed them was tired of hearing marshy screeching about goons 24/7?
---
too bad he skipped the whole understanding game mechanics part.
---
&gt; Standings.
---
but fixing those standing requires these pvp gods to actually pve and that would probably kill them.
---
Stain would like to say hello. 
---
You explicitly do not. People give recognition to things they find impressive. 
---
Most people have better things to do you know, like playing the game to have fun and stuff.
---
[you forgot their best song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvM7av1o1Q)
---
I'd recommend flying cheap stuff, because expensive ships from other people don't take that much to kill. You can kill garmurs in atrons, for example, and that will fund many more garmurs
---
You’re confusing me with a Black Legion member. 
---
Still in wormhole? 
---
just remove high, low and null sec you say?
---
Yeah was good fun, that frat counter drop tho, was getting a bit late for TIKLE unfortunately :(
---
We’re such horrible blobbers.
---
I miss when this was just EVE's mantra.
---
I reported that problem more than a month ago. CCP must have let the bug thrive. It was only 10 or so defective WHs back in the day :D
---
Can the person who is Thirdsin on reddit PM me on discord please. Thanks. 
---
Yes, we want our drugs cheap and many of them! 
---
Big null blocks run burners there (horde, goons, etc), but youll likely be undisturbed, except by OOS, they shoot everyone p much
---
  
---
When you see known ganker in local, warp off to safety.  
---
This is valid for null/low sec even more so.  
---
Or just don't live in highsec. It is boring.
---
aww sheet...
---
If you mean the logo intro it's available on the forums last time I looked ...
---
Are you talking about CS:GO here because no loss is added to your statistics the match is removed from your stats and that means you lose the CS:GO version of ELO, because of winning giving positive ELO ( that's also the method you lose rank ). 
---
Now let's turn this into eve you don't have to add losing isk to the statistics you can just remove the isk addition so that the benefit of cheating is removed for the alliance the player plays for.
---
Like honestly you keep the taxes thing, is like ripe for exploitation. 
---
I would be shocked if there are not large groups of bot owners that own the rental corp they are in and filled it up with some legit players to cover their tracks end up losing the isk on the bots but running away with the corp wallet. 
---
For the longest time, I thought FW sounded dumb. A buncha t1 frigates shooting each other just because? Nah, I wanted to fly in big fleets and take over space and use capitals. But there's a lot to be said for solo and very small gangs where you doing well (or not) makes or breaks you, where you can find fights quickly and without a lot of logistics, etc. I've been on 3-hour roams in null that had fewer fights than I can get in 15 minutes in FW space.
---
I don't know if I'd call dying to npcs and flooding reddit with salt "expertise".
---
didn't a bunch of the permaband people get laid off?
---
Sweet video, but why are all of those titans warping off to the same place on different ticks?
---
You calling Goons retarded is the epitome of the pot calling the kettle black. 
---
According to reddit, people find it impressive to gang bang 1 person in their ship with 20 to 150. Methinks we give too many accolades.
---
Tell it to the judge.
---
Wow, you weren't kidding when you said true garbage. It does look to me though as if hes trying to minimize losses and factoring in ship loss. With cap insurance the kills are costing him very little. The cheapest fit you listed on these kills is only 1.3 B. Factor insurance and he makes up the loss in a very short time.
---
You might try GW in the N-6 area. "The Network." had a bit of a trade hub going that's freeported. GW tends to be quiet but there's still some PVP to be had. You'll want to go back the the days of chaining rats in belts and if you mine, bring an ath because the ores in that region are pretty shit.
---
great thread and I like how you've explained your experience. 
---
I've always been very pvp averse, preferring to be cloaky and sneak around, but the idea of roaming around looking for fights in a frigate sounds so great. And I love flying frigates.  
---
Thanks for the write-ups btw, I've really enjoyed them.
---
&gt; Isn't that what reddit is about? Letting the people decide if something is good enough to show up on the home page?
---
Were you around for the mod strike?
---
It's shark week. There was a sticky up for several days about it. We're removing all low effort posts. So you did violate that, directly. I was being nice about it though so the whole mod rage thing was a little surprisingly honestly. Didn't want to shit on you for it in case you missed the sticky.
---
Wait, did ~~Doomchinchilla finally learn about the Rorqual changes~~ Mar5hy just learn how diamond rats work?
---
I don't see a sticky so I guess I did miss it. My apologies 
---
For one thing, I think everyone of us has the "win at all costs" mentality to a certain degree. Added to that, there are a number of players that care too much about their zkillboard. I'm not saying everyone is like that, but there definitely are players like that. I do a lot of solo pvp and I get blobbed, but I do tend to find 1v1 fights. Although I myself do go on small gang roams in which we go against 1 ship knowing that it's an easy target if we catch it. But I still try to go solo just to have a gf even if I loose. For me, it's the rush of going toe to toe with someone, not actually knowing who's going to come out at the end. And I'm sure I'm not the only one who plays for the joy, not to prove something in a space pixel game 
---
Maybe i can meet them in Vegas and they can kiss me
---
Nah it’s probably test v horde about perimeter. They have been going hammer and tongs for weeks over it
---
what's funnier is that BBTB is doing the most of the npc station games
---
mar5hy's dying to BBTB lmao
---
If he was truly going for cost reduction he would run no rigs. 
---
Nope.  This was a big fight that lasted a few hours a couple jumps away from jita.  pandemic horde with the usual nc. batphone were trying to defend a market azbel, so test, with a goon batphone came and fought them until they gave up and ceded the field.  Market azbel was reinforced to its final timer, and the test refinery in perimeter which had its armor timer during the period of the fight repaired without incident.
---
Best part was nc. and horde getting stuck in a hisec station with us camping the undock and having to deathclone out or log out.  Horde called a fleet a few hours after to get their stuck pilots back to geminate.
---
I think people call you salty because your entire life seems to revolve around being butthurt about goons, then crying on reddit about your inability to play the game. Just saying, bro, calling goons (and everyone else) who mock you "salty" in every post kinda seems like projection.
---
Good, fuck that cheater anyhow. 
---
Hey, if you're on the stronger team, you get to use your faction titans. It's a smart move.
---
Name me one place that doesn't blob because i'd like to go there.
---
Jesus Christ you’re toxic af
---
As am I. 
---
incursion with an alt
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I don't havee anything to prove I just want a damn 1v1 not get tackled by kitey ship and then blobed, its fuckin lame. I think i just need to quit and do something else with my time.
---
*Titans slowly moving from the right hand side of the screen, to the left*
---
#INCEPTION BASS *BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA*
---
Train them to farm, too!
---
&gt;TAPI sov as a question mark
---
  Yes please, come invade us daddy
---
If you have the time, I think Incursions would be about the best you can do solo with 1 omega account. 150mil/hr plus LP
---
&gt;DARKNESS: Please stay in Delve, don't invade us again
---
Or just get 1 alt with &gt; +2 standings with blood raiders and they won't shoot you.
---
I just did. He was sitting next to me in the CSM meeting. 
---
Imagine being so shit you can't even fight npc rats or understand game mechanics....Diamond rats are fuckin amazing and I wish there were FAR FAR FAR more of them ingame
---
Honorable wormholer confirmed?
---
See you in a few hours 
---
Yeah, blood raider and guristas have structures that give KMs. That is where the BPCs for their faction caps/supers drop. Was planned for the other pirate factions, last I heard that was cancelled since CCP didn't like how the Sotiyos are going.
---
We had one drop a BPC for a lowsec gate to Stain...ended up giving it to my Fedos
---
I very much doubt that the danger of being called mean is the reason FCs are scared to use it. It's just a bit harder to pull off than a conventional fleet, cause one fuck up (on both the FC's and a random Boosher's side) can get you whelped entirely. It looks amazing if you make no mistakes, but it also makes you look really stupid if you fail to boosh in time. People don't like to look stupid.
---
[A detailed breakdown of the relationship, revised...](https://i.imgur.com/uV7M0PK.gif)
---
How do you go about finding these? Seems like a great source for content. 
---
I wasn't referring to you by saying that some players want to prove something. I'm just saying that there are players in eve (and every other game for that matter) who have that kind of mindset.
---
I think you can asset safety things even if they're in an NPC null station.
---
Yeah, understandable. I think this is an easy way to get into it since the ships are cheap, the fights usually come quickly, and pretty much everyone is a good sport about it. It's not like roaming null in a stratios and taking an hour to tackle something and risking 300m if that vni has a scram on it.
---
I'm sure there are some shenanigans involved. I wouldn't be surprised if the reason is that for most people the default on your overview is that HS war allies show up as blue and don't show up by default on the combat tab on the overview. So you will not see them when they land on grid. 
---
Count on CVA to feel entitled to an honorable fight in a game where honor is a liability.
---
Nonsense. Sitting afk in a system to prevent a bot from ratting is the most fun activity you can have in eve.
---
I doubt any major powerblock is going to allow an NPSI fleet large enough to destroy structures to be roaming around in their space.
---
I highly doubt any major powerblock leadership is unaware of who the major botting suspects in their space are, they don't want to assume responsibility for the problem, and the endless drama that would ensure from false-positives and people lying about their behaviour after getting punished.
---
Only CCP has the actual hard reliable data to prove beyond reasonable doubt what people have been doing.  They are unfortunately the only party who can put any kind of reasonable impartial detection and punishment system in place, although I really wish they'd get more proactive at it.
---
Any decent alliance dont need the threat of getting their shit wrecked, my own alliance will demand any chars caught botting kicked and if the corp dont comply the corp will be purged from the alliance.

You undock those Battleships! Crash them into the enemy over and over again until all the cynos have been lit and all of the supers and titans in New Eden are at your doorstep!

---
All time your corp isnt even top 200. Git g00d
---
What I'd recommend is find a C1 or C2 wormhole with a Hi-Sec static. This will allow you to anchor an Astra and do:
---
- PI (C1 PI is just as good as C6 PI)
---
- Research cheapish BPOs &amp; re-sell (yes, you can do research in an Astra)
---
- Exploration
---
- Manufacturing, if you want
---
Pick a C1 if you want to be really left alone and don't intend on taking anything larger than a cruiser out most of the time. Pick a C2 if you want to assume a bit more risk but not have the same ship limitations.

* 64 Bit made Soon™
---
* Agency Redesign. No info and probably in "What players want" its below the 1000th thing in priority

* Citadel skins *Laughs in everyone else except goons*
---
That is a pretty good analysis of what happened.

1 VNI bot = 500M per day running for 12 hours.  1 rait = 700M (POS are even less).  Killing structures, hunting bots, etc.  doesn't do a lick of difference to the botters.  Botting is such easy isk that nothing the playerbase can do will stop it. 
---
Given what happened with horde and BL. This seems likely.

Hey bud, It sounds like you are doing awesome and started to gain some good experience. So keep it up!
---
One thing I would reccomend you start considering is developing a process. Either in how you set up for a fight or when you want to leave a fight. Also figuring out your opponents weapon systems before engaging can give you a serious upperhand.
---
I started making a video series about this stuff a few years ago if you want to check that out at all
---
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGZQKGzjdYkkF0FXD43a7ZP1eWZGdkPQM
---
Also, I reccomend checking out videos by Solomon Phi who also did alot of stuff on FW frigate pvp. Super great commentary stuff by him
---
I do take action, when it is worth my time. I'm playing a *game*, not working a job. Me as an individual can't cloaky camp a constellation, let alone a region.

I do more than you to kill bots, guaranteed, so don't be throwing that garbage at me.

Isn't Guard the only one left that didn't get fired err laid off?
---
&gt;The only difference is that we've anchored a bubble on the undock and the players in the station need to shoot it (but they're afraid to lose anything).
---
Diamond rats =/= regular rats, I think its a pretty major difference considering you need a half-dozen of logi to tank them effectively.
---
:thinking:  
---
Will be kicked soon
---
Pretty fucked mechanic tbh
---
Rats spawn in npc systems on station
---
Bubble make them stay there and continue to add up untill dt
---
Once DT ends, cycle continues
---
 
---
&gt;I don't think we've lost any playstyle whatsoever. Elitist recruiting still exists, just that goons made the mass player playstyle prominent and the speed at which these pilots grow up has been accelerated by injectors. Which is sad to me too, but then again - we are stuck with that.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Yeah, ofcourse you can argue that goons can't be defeated and that may or may not be true. I would say that nullsec entities can still band together to defeat them, but how likely is it that Panfam will colaborate with test to pull that stunt off? Not very much likely...
---
Well it's not list in the sense because it still exists. But we're speaking about viability, or at least I am. Unless PanFam changes their recruitment culture they will never ever be able to challenge the Imperium/Legacy coalition.
---
&gt; And I agree. Just that I think every advantage the defender has except local is a pure numbers advantage. 
---
Like number of citadels, number of alliance gates ;)
---
&gt; But when did we have Supercapital SRP before? I would argue that was pretty much enabled by the current wealth we have in eve on this scale. The result is: More people fly titans, more titans get destroyed. More destruction ensues. Yes, the downside is that Inflation happens, but it's much more localized in Delve than it's in the rest of new eden. I.e. Delve is seeing active regression where every ISK gets more value. Outside of New Eden, Plex tanks the majority of the inflation (which I consider a bad thing) but it shows the demand for ISK sinks that, I feel, are lacking for some years. 
---
This kind of follows the CCP mindset of things. Nullified interceptors got used more once they got nullified so CCP thought "oh this means ceptor changes are good." I dunno if you are familiar with the exchange. In essence it's not a good argument. This is like making tournament ships accessible to everyone. "Well more of them get destroyed so it's good" isn't an argument you'd put forth.
---
&gt; Absolutely. We would need an idea of what we want it to be in the end, but that's a can of worms too. How many people should you need to kill a citadel (as an example)?. I don't have answers to that. 
---
I think the multiple timers is what ruins it. The time it takes to do it, not so much how many people.  
---
&gt; But that's my View - ofc, if everything you blow up as a small gang is "already replaced" and ultimately meaningless, I can understand your point of view. That's why I would still like to buff lowsec (and WH's) so you can grab some bigger toys to destroy bigger toys for more pain. 
---
It's not even really that we'd want bigger toys. Group I fly with is the smallest of the small. 4-5 dudes. Maybe a couple ceptor alts we fling at anoms. The thick of the fleet is 3 or 4 Gilas/Kikimoras/Worms. Would be cool if with the farms and fields there was more "field burning" without having to directly assault the castle all the time.
---
I wish NC would stop holding Phorde's hand, but coalitions are what they are.
---
FACTION CITADELS WELL SPENT
---
Amazing. 
---
Did this take a whole year preparation as well?
---
Nice beat. Shame on the rest of it...
---
Why are the mean INIT guys always picking on poor NC.? I think this is a little unfair of INIT as NC clearly don't want to play eve anymore.
---
Dirty version looks better imo
---
big oof
---
Blasters is very high dmg, i think it is the general fear, though increased scram range is also adding to the equation.
---
I just chose to firesale my stuff with an auction contract or low fixed-price. The alternative is setting up a courier contract, or flying out there yourself to haul it assuming it's in an NPC station.

Asset safety should work if it's an Upwelling structure.

My day in Eve?  Login, start up the industry window and check my blueprint research, then decide if I have the energy to focus on combat or if I should do something low intensity like mining.  Contemplate learning about Planetary Interaction.  Rummage through my item hangar looking for inspiration for ship fits that I believe I can afford to field (and lose).  Read the Help Channel, and join in trying to explain the same things repeatedly. Often to the same person, who for whatever reason has decided that today their personal philosophy requires that they not spend any effort on comprehending the answers being handed out.  Realize that time is passing, and I need to get to work.  Logout.

All in all, surprisingly fun.

Has anyone ever seen marshy and gigx in the same room .. what if .. what if they are the same person... #conspiracy

grrrr people creating pvp content in eve

Still is. Just HTFU about stuff you don't like :)

You can't come for me. I uninstalled this game. 😆
---
Best to delete these move op posts before the dunk posts come in from B-D and make this all look silly.
---
hey move op is going really well guys thanks for letting everyone know
---
Don't you worry about suprise dictors with a pod like that?

well you guys tried to come for us anyway https://zkillboard.com/related/30004040/201902210300/

Sometimes you eat the bear. Sometimes, the bear eats you. Well played.

It was the way of eve, not just the mantra.  When n00b Juice blapped me when I moved to 0.0 in my first few months I did.  
---
Joining a new player friendly corporation/alliance will help (a lot) with that overwhelmed feeling you have. They exist to help new players get an anchor and have the support they need to try out different aspects of the game until they find a playstyle that suits them. 
---
These are the biggest and most successful new player friendly groups (and their political alignment in parenthesis):
---
* Eve Uni (neutral)
---
* Brave Newbies (Legacy)
---
* Brand Newbros (TEST/Legacy)
---
* Karmafleet (Goons/Imperium)
---
* Pandemic Horde (PanFam)
---
Why would they do that ? Unless they have direct evidence that you knew what / who it was at recruitment time, or that it has been brought up to you multiple times and you let em thrive instead of kicking them out.
---
Otherwise they will jsut remove the Plex, ISK, whatver else the botters gave you and you'll receive a message in one for or another why it was removed and you'll be left alone.
---
Now if they do have evidence then hey ..... 
---
Not sure I’ve ever seen a post age poorly so quickly

I am really not sure if i should upvote or downvote this adorable little post...

You're thinking of NCdotto. PL are now high-sec mercenaries
---
That's my eventual plan once I have the ISK for the astra and the PI stuff.
---
Regarding a typical day in Eve for me...
---
I check Mumble and Discord first to see if my corp has anything going on. If they do, I log on my main account and get in fleet. Like a lot of players who have been around for more than a year, my main account is dedicated to pvp and I have alternate accounts for other purposes. My corp focuses on small gang pvp and ganking (killing defenseless targets) so most of our fleets involve guerrilla tactics and doing the best we can to stay mobile to avoid letting the enemy drop the hammer on us. Other times my whole alliance might mobilize for a bigger goal -- usually killing an enemy citadel or taking territory -- and those fights can involve thousands of people and take most of the night.
---
But if there's nothing going on then I'll just log in my alt accounts back in our homeland and go "krabbing" (making money). Krabbing is the grind in Eve, so I'll put on a movie and log in some semi-AFK VNI alt to kill pirates (rats) while I watch it. If I want to maximize my money making I'll have a couple of accounts killing rats and another account doing exploration, because I live in an area where there are unusually lucrative exploration rewards, but that involves paying more attention. Just depends on my mood, really.
---
where is init going, a dumpster?
---
I never realized how much of a whiny bitch this dude is. 
---
It is definitely a good way to learn the basics of wormholes with relatively low risk as long as you stay in cheap ships. Plus, having your own wormhole is a pretty cool feeling.... A little area of deep unknown space all to yourself.
---
What the fuck
---
Exploration and wh ratting in a wh with trash statics to avoid conflict, or C13 ratting. I do exploration and C13 ratting myself with very little work since loads of sites spawn in any given C13 in a day. If you have an interest in any of this pm me and I can get you set up

inb4 ccp nerfs goon ratting income by actually removing npc's from delve/querious
---
kill goons and then the blood raiders at let lose and will take over new Eden there will be nothing to stop them.
---
illed love to see them dropping ratters and miners when they get sick off our shit. they got some nice bountys
---
THe widow was IN the capital though, so it was insured, lmao. Do you need to relearn game mechanics, Insurance is handled the SAME way that asset safety is. Every since citadels. You think those init pilots care, lmao ok big guy.
---
I bet you still eat fucking gluten too
---
99.9% holy hell
---
Better look into system next Door. Only a little hint for next time :-)
---
Not 100%, though. Freakin' scrubs.
---
maybe theyre apologizing for running away scared during the fight we tried to help them with
---
so... a 1.6B (total, with fit) that has a plat insurence payout of 365M that cost 109M... that's still about a 1.3B lost. Math is hard i know.
---
Not actually true. You can activate the codes again if you let the account lapse. 
---
Interesting, thank you!
---
ITT: init downplaying a feed lmao
---
[Listen to this video by Shines.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkElSyNI-jg) Then listen to OP's video. You can here the song that Shines used in his video in the background of this one. Which means he didn't take the original intro to use, he just cut it from Shines and pasted it into his own lmao. I'm not knocking him too hard for it, I just find it super janky
---
It was double insurance since the ship it was in was insured as well
---
Hi, Init here.
---
This post is retarded, they killed half of an entire move op the next system over. Sabers are dead as soon as you undock them.
---
Big oof.
---
Day 1 btw
---
Was a move op gank
---
AAR: We caught wind of INIT US TZ suitcase caps trying to catch up with the rest of their group in deployed in Hakonen. We burned a ways out, logged off nearby in low-sec, and worked with some friends to drop Nightmares and HICs to pick em off one by one. Other side was bubblefucked. INIT couldn't form fast enough to save em in time. 
---
Shout-out to NSH for being true bros helping us make it happen
---
Looking forward to the rest of the deployment. Everyone has to try once!
---
the carrier died too
---
Getting baited on a Wallypost in 2019... yikes

And?
---
I shall make that my new home

So many possibilities to explore.
---
Hot garbage????
---
Idk feed is usually used in the context of an actual fight.  
---
If moves get caught, they die, hard.

Exactly, he got 2 insurance payments

Well, I do have a small sample size. But the last two days I got several fights between 1400 and 1500.

You want to nerf pleb PVE so you can have pleb PVP
---
Good to know 
---
Still bookmarking good people. Spin it how you like
---
Dual web + high dps fits are very strong, lots of T1 destroyers and blaster frigs uses that kind of fits. But dual web no scram fits are always some niche fit, not in mainstream. People get used to it very fast.
---
In other words, you can fly dual web no scram fits sometimes but not always; because everyone will check your kb and try to counter your fit, or will just avoid you.
---
And versus decent players, there is very low chance to win against faction frig with your T1 frig. but there is always low hanging fruit. Lots of guys fly faction frig with low skill (they have too much bonus for each frig skill level, so they are terrible with low skills), or awkard shit fit, so you can win against them in T1 frig, but you'll need drug like exile booster and pyro/hardshell.
---
I strongly recommend to use drugs if you're just gonna fight against T1 frigs. Exile+hardshell is only 3m, It can save your 8m frig (at least). Even if they save your ship in only one fight, it's already cost-effective. There is no reason to not use drugs.
---
Plus tactics are very different with drugs (and implants). For example, Let's say enemy has like 140\~150dps. Basically you can't run all anci rep's full charged cycle under that dps. 
---
But wIth Exile + hardshell, You can. It means you will get lots of more ehp and It allows you to make more risky play, and even expands your engage spectrum. So If you think you will use drugs someday, start it asap; there is no reason to not use them, and you must get used to it.
---
I definitely need to figure out how to get the time to look at my opponents as I'm/they're landing so I can try to get to the correct range asap. I'm so rushed in those seconds already though that I'm pretty sure trying to do so right now will just mess me up. I'm getting better about my exact order of actions in the first two seconds of the fight though.
---
I will have to check out the videos tomorrow!
---
his dread's payout only covers his own dread hull. not enough to cover the widow
---
it's still a net lost
---
Ok dude lol
---
Not a single northern shithead on the Kills, neither Arschy-Marshy. I am happy about that fact !

There was this meme in Bastion about "Fountain is safe". I remember how they talked about how safe Fountain is on a meeting, and in the same minute Zkillboard pinged 5 lost rorquals there. Afaik its a dream of being independent strong and black from Goons.
---
If you don't understand, try joining fleet next time
---
the videos "move proactively" and "gather information" will be particularly helpful then i think
---
I just don't know why people who live and breath this subreddit try to do these weird flexes.  
---
"Lol you're not in my cool kids reddit club because you don't know xxThatBeeGuyxx, nothin personell kiddo :sunglasses:"
---
They also dont suck northern balls like Marshy and all the other "independent" entitys.
---
You have posted 5 times in the last month, and *I* “live” in this sub?
---
Tell that to the dude whose Marshal dropped which we subsequently popped. Bet the payout was lovely (oh wait, no one fucking insures Marshals)
---
You see the problem here is your being completely unrealistic. If you have insurance on the dread and the ships inside the dread then you get paid a premium your being trolled you fucking moron on both ships based on the insurance of the dread. When. The widow died it was payed out as well because the dread died but it doesn't matter because you clearly are fucking stupid
---
Excuse me, that's a top secret tick mark 
---
 Be all that you can be. 
---
holy fuck i want moa back, is it just nostalgia, or were they less whiny than this?
---
How the Fuck Do You LOSE!! 205Bil in Caps to so called Deployment?????????????

Still sounds a fine proposal to me tbh.

Has time to dick wag but doesn't join fleet, thought Synda left NC

y'all are just making delve a better place by removing the pleb. Good job!

Can you leave PH alone for that long time ?

please don't plug your own youtube videos thanks

Who else are they going to sell all those supers to?

Its a game muh dude.

Nothing really matters in eve, possibly only the friend ships you make.

er... can you write out the math here? idk wtf are you talking about

PL should have never joined the Political Theater!
---
I was going to remove this post but I'm scared of what that Tormentor will do to me.
---
nah they never used caps because gevlon was all about the isk k/d ratio.
---
I also happen to run an insurance company. It was in fact tripple insured!

*Exactly*. Isn't this another reason to support pleb-killers?

plenty more where he came from im sure

My typical day in Eve. 
---
   1. Log on to my market alt and update orders.  You have to find a way to make isk. You need isk to have fun, no isk no fun. I'll explain more in a second. 
---
  2. After updating my orders I swap over to my main that's in a null sec alliance. With him, I run anomolies (anoms) or sites, killing pirates (rats) to collect bounty ticks. I also have some planetary interactions I am doing, which is another type of industry. I send all the isk I make over to my market alt.
---
  3. Occasionally neutrals (neuts) will jump into my systems, that requires me to jump into a PvP ship and fight them off. Hopefully all goes well and we win the fights.
---
  4. Before I log off for the day I jump to my market alt to invest all the isk I made that day and place any new buy orders I may find that offer decsnt profits. 
---
For me, that market alt is crucial because it makes your isk work for you. It allows you to go AFK from the game and still have an income. Trust me you can make billions in the market. Buy low and sale high. 
---
Fly safe and have fun. Hope my tips help. 
---
~~You see the problem here is your being completely unrealistic.

---
this is what we get for killing them off
---
What makes you think, someone/group, outside a major nullbloc can’t coordinate anything while using others as batphones?
---
Should be reflected on the MER reports next release
---
Log - undock - kill - die - trash talk. Repeat
---
You are trying to get acceptance from goons, one of the worse mob mentalities of any game, ever. It aint going to happen my dude. Just embrace the salt/retardation and keep doing your thing.
---
Wait what? If it loses omega you can activate the pack on it again? 
---
I guess the point of my post was lost on the average pilot. BUMS have been fighting NSH for the last month and a half. On a few of the big timers, we called others for help, including snuff. This has led NSH screaming about batphones(even though they've called Rote Kapelle and TNT for basically every fight). Now here they are showing up not only as a batphone, but to fight the people they batphoned to call us. I know it sounds dumb, but we've been living it, and I just found it funny.
---
Battleships or logistics. Depending on who you run with, you’ll fit them for armor or shield. I prefer to run with Warp To Me - they’ve been great, and they have excellent starter fittings for people who can’t fit the expensive or high-skill-cap stuff yet.
---
Thank you for killing this guy, people like this are good for nothing but padding ratting numbers and attracting hot droppers, the more he dies the more likely he is to leave, you are doing delve a great service.
---
ITS STILL SHARK WEEK WALLY save ur ammo for a few more days
---
yeah but how many of those posts have effort tho
---
and remind me which one of us can recognize posting styles by username?

Feed 200b on the first day SPICEY deployment

imagine getting baited on a wally post LMAO
---
its okay wally they just dont understand
---
The OP was literally flying a nightmare on the side that did the killing.
---
I just linked it because a friend said marshy was whining about this on discord and I got screen shots
---
he forgot to log into his reddit alt to upvote his troll post give the NCdocked member a break its been months since he actually tried to play eve and talk about it.
---
Double insurance earns compound interest across the life of the policy on payout. How are we the first to explain this to you? This one widow/dread combo payout should finance our entire campaign. Thanks for the paper, PanFam.
---
no evidence of that, can't assume that either
---
it's sealclubbing and idiotic for the most part, for sure.
---
but it's still not player vs ENVIRONMENT
---
Going well so far...lel.

mr. know it all

mr. know it all?

The once a year thing only involves setting your home station remotely.  You can always set your clone to the npc station where you are docked regardless of clone service availability.
---
TBH. i would argue that J-space mining is safer than nullsec if you have the stuff set up, and have full hole control. but you have to worry about eviction, and logistics is really hard. I have played in J-space for a week and i don't really feel it's for me. but isk wise it's pretty decent, and very safe
---
Replying to another golden Omeca post.
---
Anything outside of boosting excavators he's shit at pvp
---
You see when excavators die it actually BENEFITS the delve-units we are making 25/7 :^)
---
no evidence it was an accident either, can't assume that either
---
Way to kill your legend.  You were once known as that interesting guy who booshes excavators and makes billions doing it. Now you make shitposts on Reddit. The legend has died.
---
This is actually a *benefit* for GSF
---
How many alts do you own again?
---
Well there you go. Today I learned!
---
Remember, guys, goons definitely aren't living rent-free in this guy's head.
---
Its flair bait dummy, who would openly admit to being in cva lol.
---
P sure the dudes saying NSH helped set up the gank/kills. Not really a batphone then.
---
P. safe to say that GSF laughed at this guy instantly considering everyone laughed at him instantly.
---
You're not even getting the best part of the drama from this post, either.
---
Very cool Kayne 
---
Oh you were only *pretending* to be stupid. My bad!
---
Wow the latest MER showed that you guys are having a serious effect on del- oh wait it's higher than ever. Well done. Goons are super salty though, keep repeating that until you believe it :)
---
It's all an RMT scheme and you're getting in the way.
---
Y'know, you could extend shark week another, just 1 extra week for good measure.
---
I have two questions...
---
1. Is there a way to make the game's sound effects not get quieter when you zoom out? I love the sound effects, but I really prefer a wide scope to view things.
---
2. How come faction loot never drops from anything in level 4 missions... ever?
---
To add to this, corps generally don't care about your corp history, so don't be afraid to switch often to find the right fit
---
You're confusing "salty" with "amused" again. Projection is at maximum.
---
Bless Odin's Call though for real.
---
no.
---
I'm waiting for prices to go even lower before i buy one. damn you.
---
I do that from time to time, but it ends in a few different ways. I think quitting is the right answer tbh, I won eve once before, not sure what I was thinking was going to happen when I came back. Came back in August after 10 years and its clear the game can't really progress in the way I would want it to, in fact the opposite. 
---
you don't assume it's an accident, you just don't assume it's intentional
---
and then you look at the fact that literally everyone agrees it's reasonable to be an accident and then realize if you use this as a point in a discussion you're delusional 
---
Nice work! Must have taken a while
---
Looks like good content so far.
---
Its places like this area that keep me optimistic about eve. Sure big battles drawn attention, but when welter weights go at each other and dont bat phone everyone and their brother to show up is when its fun.
---
Im glad pure blind is turning into what querious should have been, or dare i say what provi should be
---
Tfw you don't have 10:1 numbers and actually have to do something
---
You're a hero Olmeca. Don't stop.
---
Drawing attention to it will only kill the party.
---
Tfw you find out these worthless fucks are driving ccps bottom line and you're meaningless in the grand scheme

he says he can't be on comms because we'd hear everything, but there is literally software to split output so you can't hear comms. 
---
Rigs don't drop afaik.
---
It is not init's pvp content they are laughing at
---
It's their video content
---
We need a remix on that song to "the content bus is coming"
---
It's just too easy to collect salt. 
---
Pureblind: Npc space, Low sec, and a cluster of wing ding pipes and bad space. Looks like a more fun brawl then a few frat houses going at it.

Ah, this is about you getting bullied by npcs. I was wondering because i hadn't seen one of your "pls look at meeee" posts in a while.
---
Bet this one will age better than the first take
---
We only hit PH to toughen them up, it builds character
---
I know I did...need to change my pants now
---
&gt; To kill the pleb, we also need to endure constant attempts to mentally break us by personal harassment, by hundreds of mega alliance reddit warriors.
---
first of all how dare you
---
why did he give up right away? i see lots of ways he could have maybe escaped since he got ab instead of 500mwd. if he had instantly aligned to warp away from bubble, had nsa on, blap the bubble and any tackle that would come from cyno. It took 50 seconds from landing on site for saber to put new bubble up, this 50 seconds he could have easily aligned out for warp since i dont see hic point and before all the heavy scrams could land
---
is 20b ship nowdays really not worth even trying to save? not to mention having ozone for cyno 
---
also dscanning sites before warping helps you from gettin caught in anchorable bubles since they show up in it, specially advisable in systems with cloacky camper..
---
Needed more anime tiddy in fleet
---
This, they made the magic happen
---
Didn't even take the lowsec gate to Stain, just give up, lmao
---
lmao. grr goons
---
Good shit lmfao
---
this is his second super loss in under a month
---
he died the exact same way when he lost a hel on the third
---
death to goons (in game)
---
The answer to all your questions: goon line member

Fantastic video.

I was in the room when they showed that for the first time. Amazing :-)

LOL at least if you have the balls to rat in a Nyx with NO TANK at least be on standing fleet and comms or have a refit available for PVP,  FFS. I do that in a shitty Thanatos which is worth less than 10% of the Nyx. Not to say about liquid ozone, this guy should never fly a capital or super again in his Eve life.
---
Delete the post before snuffed or one of the big blobs sees it
---
yeah this guy is an idiot. I informed him of a factual mechanic on his stream once, and he 'reminded me' that it was my opinion, then muted me on chat. lmao
---
Snuff and Init are well aware and crash the party sometimes. Makes it even more challenging to fight the fight when you never know if the big blocks show up with 50 titans. 
---
Remove pleb (in game).
---
o/
---
I don't think so. All eyes from all the big groups have been on us from the start. Made us stand down whenever they bring more titans then we have in fleet, but now that Init and Snuff are both deployed away from the area there should be even more consistent action. I am looking forward to it. 
---
except it was fake querious

This is much lower than goon line member.

Oh yea... kinda one-trick-pony but I can see how that could appeal to someone.

I'm thinking about getting back into the game and I happen to really like killing Goonswarm. What Alliance should I join?

Yea you fucking idiot "elite pvper" we build the supers so everytime you kill one, you actually put money into more goons pockets! Thanks for stimulating the delve economy idiot

Lol gg death to all plebsss

uhh calm down there buddy

second what gives you the right
---
And nothing of value was lost.
---
Has anyone worked out who the bigger idiot is here? I'll admit, I'm struggling.
---
&gt; Well it's not list in the sense because it still exists. But we're speaking about viability, or at least I am. Unless PanFam changes their recruitment culture they will never ever be able to challenge the Imperium/Legacy coalition.
---
I don't think that recruitment culture is the only option they have - I mean, they have this mix of elitists and mass recruiting between their alliances (Imho), so it's not like they can't keep that up to some degree. What they really need is to up their "political game" a bit. The nonsense they did with blueneutraling each other for content isn't exactly how you would fight against goons and the split from GoTG over what happened.. well, I think it's more of an EGO problem at the top than a recruitment programm. 
---
&gt;Like number of citadels, number of alliance gates ;)
---
Yeah, absolutely a numbers advantage too, because if you don't have the numbers to set them up, keep them fueled (especially the gates, dear lord) and to protect them if necessary, they wouldn't exist. Well, they probably would cause noone bothers to destroy them. :D
---
&gt;This kind of follows the CCP mindset of things. Nullified interceptors got used more once they got nullified so CCP thought "oh this means ceptor changes are good." I dunno if you are familiar with the exchange. In essence it's not a good argument. This is like making tournament ships accessible to everyone. "Well more of them get destroyed so it's good" isn't an argument you'd put forth.
---
that's a bad argument though. AT ships are meant to be exclusive. You don't want exclusive stuff to die all the time cause that would mean you would need to seed more of them. So more destruction can only be ensured by usage and you can't have much usage with little ships in circulation. 
---
So, the idea of having them destroyed more often is against their purpose. The purpose of all other ships (i.e. the ones that can be produced at will) is to get destroyed, so usage (and loss) metrics are a viable argument imho. I don't disagree with ceptors in general either. Less dangerous traveling is an option that has it's place in Eve. 
---
&gt;I think the multiple timers is what ruins it. The time it takes to do it, not so much how many people.
---
Mhm, I don't think it's that, necessarily. While low power structures seem to die more often, there is not an exactly a hunt for LP citas either. I would say that's a more minor part on the big scale - ofc more relevant to you but very much irrelevant for bigger entities. 
---
&gt;It's not even really that we'd want bigger toys. Group I fly with is the smallest of the small. 4-5 dudes. Maybe a couple ceptor alts we fling at anoms. The thick of the fleet is 3 or 4 Gilas/Kikimoras/Worms. Would be cool if with the farms and fields there was more "field burning" without having to directly assault the castle all the time.
---
I don't necessarily disagree with "field burning", but at some point, it gets unreasonable to me really. Do you really expect that you should be able to cause anything but trivial damage with 4-5 people and that you should be able to cause a lot of damage with few people and easily at that? 
---
I mean, the odds are stacked against you (defenders advantage) and you stack the odds against yourself by refusing to bring adequate ships and numbers, yet you somehow expect that it should still be viable? Yes, defenders got it easier, but all these advantages come from the fact that they didn't refuse to grow bigger in numbers and ships they can afford to toss at you.. 
---
This notion that "you should be able to cause signifcant damage no matter who the enemy is and how many they are" is something I really can't agree with. If you refuse to use available options, then catering to you won't help unless the advantage is so extremely stacked in your favor that a win for you is pretty much guaranteed... 
---
So, for me, the solution is not to "give you more advantages untill you can make it" (which is what local would be in a lot of cases), and more of a "motivation to get you out of the shell that restricts you", which may or may not be impossible. 
---
While I am certainly willing to argue about how we could shift some things around to make it more reasonable for both sides, I still see your motivation as one of your biggest disadvantages. Not saying it's all about you, but a major problem is your voluntary exile too. For me, it's only natural that "if your enemy has more people, you should bring more people too" and that "if your enemy uses bigger guns, you should consider bigger guns too". 
---
From clobbering IRS/pospy with their worms to joining goons, how far those guys have fallen 
---
They are using game mechanics very well just as people do in hisec when blowing up freighters.    I laughed when I realized what they were doing it is clever gameplay.     And by the way I absolutely love these rats in hisec, it is better than PvP at times.
---
Oh nooooo causing problems for some people whose whole entire lives revolve around grring goons?
---
How incredibly unfair!
---
Nice read! 
---
I've tried FW a couple of times but not enough to feel that I get a hang of it, but I really like the 1v1 idea. But it always feels like you get dropped on by someone with faction stuff on so they have both that edge with a lot better stuff and also probably more experience. 
---
Really nice with the novice yearbook, I should give that a read. All these ships that you lost, how much ISK did you put into them approx? Learning by exploding is expensive \^\^

You are implying that if you have lots of losses then you are bad at pvp. Check lussy lou / suitonia / bjorn or any of the other extremely good pvp pilots. They all have several thousand of losses.

Incursions mate, you can make 100 to 200 mill per hour per character in highsec. Then the money you make you can use to fly with bombers bar or specter fleet to get your pew pew on.

\&gt; To sustain the negative sum game, we have to develop innovative methods like excavator booshing just so we can fund the investment of fighting vs. a 40k alliance.   
---
This and this:   
---
\&gt; To kill the pleb, we need afk campers, pushing hardware boundaries by coming up with best computational solutions to run so many accounts.   
---
as legitimate arguments. Your "argumentation" get's less good and more stupid every time you make a post. From "oh noes, noone can have an umbrella because goons have the biggest", it went over to "Oh noes I need more people so the only option is to crank up my hardware!!!!" to the now "oh noes, I have to have funds to blow stuff up".   
---
Now, I've seen it all. Including a self inflicted burial for every discussion in the future because of the bad arguments you've made here.   
---
But thank you for making delve a better place by killing plebs. :))  
---
EVE's problems aren't summarized in 2 or 3 bullet points. I see it more as a problem in the mindset of CCP, especially now that PA took over. Fact remains that the amount of online accounts has stagnated, which is worrisome when considering the game ostensibly went F2P in 2016. I really wonder what the ratio of alts is nowadays, but i can only assume that it's increase since 2016, with the downward trajectory of active players/subscriptions having remained constant since 2014.
---
PA's main (and only) game is the very antithesis to EVE, with an extremely regulated, event-based economy (which *still* manages to be utterly broken), nigh zero cooperative gameplay and very little meaningful competitive gameplay, let alone an extremely predatory cash shop. I shudder to think about the influence they will have on EVE moving forward.
---
I don't have any solutions. I only see a game i've played and loved for 15 years on a decline, and i lament the fact that this is happening in the first place. Most of all, i don't really see anything coming out of CCP which would make me think that it's going to get better. Seagull had a vision, but since she's gone it seems her vision went with her. Where does CCP want to go from here? They had a very clear vision for this in 2009, but it never materialized.
---
From K-spacer POV: 
---
They have become waaay prolific recently. I'd never seen one, then one popped in our home system and I mentioned it to my (ex-wormholer) partner, who promptly made his "the end is nigh" face and told me not to even consider going near it. That one has been dying/respawning several times since, but I've noticed loads of them in high sec systems, too, including literally 5 in one .9, which seems like a recipe for disaster (or hilarity, depending on your viewpoint).

---
dude uh calm down a bit there
---
You probably thought it would look funny but this is actually an important lack in the game right now. There is very little low end pvp content left. This is the direct consequence of recent changes from ccp. It restricts most pvp to surprise ganking and running away because it’s the only way to kill plebs like this and there is no middle ground content for activities like roaming etc.
---
"it doesnt matter" "I would have died anyway" ugh... minimal effort involved to get saved in delve will always be too much effort for the pleb

&gt; we need to constantly innovate new methods to ensure kills happen

But yeah, if CCP allows 3rd party apps to allow functions, then it should update its policies on the fly. 
---
Are macro's allowed? Can I set a macro to alt tab through menu's then alt tab through clients? This is all done via a Logitech Keyboard... 
---
My point is that CCP sets no boundaries and is vague as fuck. When you ask basement dwelling nerds who are vitamin D deficient to play a spreadsheet game, they will find ingenious ways to optimise that play. 
---
By not setting boundaries CCP is:
---
* Making Nerds cry on Reddit
---
* Unnecessary support / complaint Tickets
---
* Client Bans / loss in customers. (this is a big one these days)

PS&gt; Rorquals should be removed from Eve

At the end, he seems to be very relaxed, streams, so kinda entertains people that are interested in what he's doing and he's not botting ...

Yes he could do things better ... but hunters got a kill, he will continue pve'ing probably in an equal way, or might try to improve at least something (who knows).

Just imagine all ratters would in fact have multiple alts, would be super careful all the time, would dock the moment they sense somethings not right. Super kill amount would decrease hard.

You are not talking about 250 people but about 7 guys that will have 2 hunters moving in making all botters dock/warp each time they are getting close **significantly decreasing botting time** as bots usually wait 5-15minutes before starting to rat again.

An Init vs Skillu brawl would be pretty dope. Imo they're the two most 'l33t' alliances atm, with NCPL in a waning/rebuilding phase right now.

If the former, bomber bar, if the latter, Pandemic Horde (or NC/PL I guess if you have the SP).
---
Baits for the Bait Gods !
---
It is a valid point. I was just highlighting how your crusade for that gate made is so well known that I can't even read old news, that I though was new,  without thinking about that low sec gate.
---
he will just create more charecter and start again

electron blasters have like 6km optimal 3km falloff with null :((((

It has to be

Solution: dont mine in highsec oO
---
goalposts? moved
---
i like how they hyped up their deployment with that tryhard video and already fed a quarter of a trillion in two fights
---
I’d vote for that just to laugh at all the angry drone hunters, even if I have 4 rorqs myself
---
It's all good!
---
careful, there are people that actually believe this
---
Imagine putting unironically a blops in a suitcase 🤮
---
Awesome sauce dude. Plus, small thing but Corp: 31; Fleet: 29. That's fantastic that everyone is actually active and does stuff :)
---
Fair enough, seemed indeed very suspicious to have CCP actually doing something about it.
---
Why you lower your Aly numbers?
---
Why you didnt mention Wombats  \* who win you half fights \* on your side?
---
Why you didnt say that only 1 marshal kill cover all nid loses?
---
Why you sad 4 weeks when you are here from December and didnt make any progress?
---
Why are you laying to your ppl and entire EVE about our standigs?
---
Why you dont link all fights and miss to say that your aly eff is down from 78 to 75 since you moved here?
---
Why you didnt mention last night you jumped 20 on raging with 2 Minokawa and i menage to kill you hugin and broadsword \*  2 MINOKAWAS LOL \* which cost more then Nid?:)
---
Why you insult in local every day?
---
Why you cal yourself PVP aggressive aly when you are partial aggressive only during CTAs and most day /night docked?
---
Why you didn't say that you lost 2 trilion ISK!!! since you start ''invasion''..with 2 trilion i would take deklein and branch and half tribute
---
Why Torry 
---
why..

we will keep snuff busy for you then :P

Friends? That some new form of currency?

You cannot compare paper numbers. If you would refer to active pilots your initial statement and the poster's arguments would be true.

makes you realize how much of these trailers include random stuff that we will never see just to hype
---
CCP why is stainguy still making shitty reddit posts
---
I am sure i will downvote botho of them, because talking to yourself is stupid. 
---
We DO believe you!
---
For the same reason there are low slot modules that increase mining laser yield, but no modules that increase mining drone yield. I guess.
---
I don't care about nullsec, and I don't have my MLP skins (((
---
I care
---
Lol he's even making his own 'we killed a ratting super' threads now.
---
I believe it is that new ship that they are constantly advertising for.
---
&gt; Because we kill plebs, our legitimate balance opinions regularly get supressed by downvotes and toxicity. 
---
Is that why you are on top of reddit ? Stop playing the victim card, 90% of your post are low effort cringe shit, but time to time you decide to do this kind of post, funny and well made that make everyone laugh (well beside the "pleb")
---
And.? Where not talking about them, there weak slow an no real threat to most things. Even the titan rats laugh able.
---
You must be new here. Click his username.

Well done guys. Dieing in Delve is like failing to steal candy from a baby.
---
Too much bots banned - eve is dying, eve is bots, 
---
if you want to have a decent pvp and have some real life left 
---
GO and get a BOT
---
People, who have time to fly around and have time to check other people, whether they are bots or not, probably dont have a real life, to go to a gym or go fuck smb they sit and look for bots instead
---
CCP better make some good content to attract new players and keep old instead of starting a witch hunt or online will continue to drop
---
How much people are alive in minor to big alliances with like 2500 - 20000 players, how much come to CTA?
---
Its poop time!!  
---
Why so aggressive do you also rarely farm your farmhole?
---
oof. wtb friends
---
I think most would be happy despite losing the ability to hunt drones.
---
Jealous ?
---
From what I can tell CCP has a hard time making friends why would I trust them for advice?
---
oh I got one: "EBWF public" ingame for some small and relaxed roaming :) 
---
you are just making the super market healthy :p
---
OP is salty because the game meta has gone in a direction that generates more income for CCP and forces him into real PVP situations when all he wanted was to gank supers.   
---
Tank well and code has no chance while you're watching Netflix
---
Highsec shouldn't really be competing with null.
---
CCP making something not good you say? Is it a day ending in a Y?
---
Yeah my ass fun as this post looks like cry for help as "mighty" tri cant do anything without someone else holding their hands. Just go back to hole feom which you crawled in. Kudos to "little" guys holding your asses on fire. 
---
You miss the part where he say he kill someone not in fleet, not on coms, without liquid ozone and streaming all of that for few hours for almost a year but proud of killing it... This guy was in my corp, I'm the one who told him I was using paper tank, but he did not learn anything from what I told him, MWD to get out safe, dscan, never rat with neut in local, always be align to safe spot etc etc and trust me, he do that for almost a year and it's only 2 month they start hunt that "Please kill me" super... but well, great kill though 
---
PL is a joke now, R1OT/pmcunt is genuine trash
---
Mining != production, quality of ore and quantity you can acquire.     
---
Abyssals are pretty good isk if you do the t4s consistently
---
You know you can resize the launcher?
---
The default size does just show 6 but I can see 7 accounts on mine, if I had an 8th I'd drag it down a bit to see it.
---
nice attempt to look smart
---
Nonsense, advertisement nr 1.
---
There are people who stream themselves doing courier contracts in high sec, I'll never understand why such mundane things get so many viewers
---
i know you can resize it vertically, but you can't horizontally without losing functionality because the advertisements take precedence over functionality 
---
wait those have been paid out already? because i got at least 3 accounts that where omega at the stated date in the dev blog and i didnt get anything
---
Sounds to me like you should rename this thread as Small size alliance conflicts are extremely fun and alive in Pure Blind and let Ranger Regiment speaks for themselves
---
PL admitted they are the laughing stock of EVE atm by recruiting them lmao 
---
'wtf is this shit i can't even see more than 6 accounts at a time'
---
So you already knew you can, great post then well done.

whats worse...spodbrains or gate campers. not sure tbh

People who want to see them get dropped on or people who want to drop on them
---
raw numbers from dotlan mean nothing, some alliance (like goons) don't give a fuck about alt and afk people and end up with with big numbers on paper but nothing in game
---
As an ex MoA pilot myself I can confirm, I got berated for wanting to drop a carrier on someone once in PB :'(
---
its really not. 
---
the upside is that this type of guy only shows up rarely for fleets. So while they make up 90% of the membership, in any given fleet they only make up 5% of the numbers.
---
Good thing that NC is totes not just around the corner with their super stager 😏
---
it could be better, it's currently dogshit and takes up an entire monitor in order to see 15 accounts at best
---
RMT. pay people ISK to watch your stream, twitch pays you dollars.
---
Kill 'em all.
---
... and death to all supers...
---
a retarded corp that cant even gate camp properly 
---
I post and fit better, so probs not.
---
An untested force is a weak force.
---
Oh come on now, PL is one, fun, happy family! People respect each other. Leadership respects their members, they do their best to expand and improve the number of active players. There's absolutely no bullying, hazing, insulting etc. It's a geniuinely fantastic place to be! That's why I left.
---
as a supercap producer...
---
who else would watch a ratter stream but people he is paying ISK to in game for twitch views?
---
MarkeeDragon was streaming himself super ratting once, but he accidentally lit his cyno on his hel... which was kinda funny. Also streamed himself hauling with a JF and got volleyed into structure by a nyx (so close!) 
---
fuck that one was fun )
---
TBH if the person is doing nothing, not interacting, and there is no real chat interaction, they probably just embed their stream on websites hidden away. Similar to how Daopa does it.

Have a diamond miner out, when its attacked, tackle and cyno in a super and a fax.
---
That's the "we want them to fight like players" attitude we need.
---
Do they gatecamp?  Last time I've seen them they tried for some random high sec pocos we had after refusing to fight without playing station games they tried to turn it into a dread brawl in the next door low sec lol.
---
Very elite
---
The shattered but whole.
---
kinda funny when 4 alliances are stated that have 2500 members in total together...all the batphones and allies rdy to join in when stuff gets serious and the then whole situation is called "medium size"

That an roaming fleets. Maybe even then making pushes into there regions.

it's a good frag, because streamsniping people is funny
---
&gt;you sound like the kind of drooler to complain about cloaky camping, a lifetime F1 monkey unable to comprehend that some people actually put effort into this game
---
Because I mock some of his arguments and cheer for the kill he made? That's a weird assumption tbh. 
---
Catch, hunting goons, exploration traps etc.
---
My fits are about 10 million on average? T2 guns, a mix of meta and t2 mids and lows, t1 rigs, t2 drones, a bit of ammo and paste, etc. 
---
Loot from winning a fight is actually fairly significant compared to the cost of the ship you're using, since some individual modules and most t2 drones can be worth a million each. So when you win a fight, you can easily get 4-5 million in loot and drop it off in the nearest station with a repairshop to fix your heat and stuff. You'll end up with crap laying around everywhere, probably not useful for really "making isk" unless you stage out of the system you get your fights in most often, but at least you can refit or top off on drones or something if you need to when out and about in the future.
---
&gt; I do more than you to kill bots, guaranteed 
---
I have camped Pandemic Horde staging for the past 4 straight months. Now kindly bow out of this thread before you make an even bigger fool of yourself. 
---
&gt;I strongly recommend to use drugs even if you're just gonna fight against T1 frigs. Exile+hardshell is only 3m, It can save your 8m frig (at least). Even if they save your ship in only one fight, it's already cost-effective. There is no reason to not use drugs.  
---
&gt;Plus tactics are very different with drugs (and implants). For example, Let's say enemy has like 140\~150dps. Basically you can't run all anci rep's full charged cycle under that dps.  
---
&gt;But with Exile + hardshell, You can. It means you will get lots of more ehp and It allows you to make more risky play, and even expands your engage spectrum. So If you think you will use drugs someday, start it asap; there is no reason to not use them, and you must get used to it. 
---
Yeah, that makes sense I suppose. I think my reasoning for avoiding them (and implants) was to not just so totally overwhelm the folks I run into who aren't max-skill and also using drugs/implants so that I was killing stuff even when I was making a lot of mistakes, and possibly not realizing what I was messing up because of the boosters/implants sort of being a crutch. But I guess I generally notice what I'm messing up on when I watch my recordings, even if I did go on to win the fight, so might as well become a junkie.
---
It's a good excuse to fly my hauler down anyway. I forgot t2 pulse crystals, MASBs, and a few rigs that can be useful in my initial shipment of stuff :)
---
That’s just awesome. Glad to see Tri is doing a great at adapting its size and getting rid of useless members http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Triumvirate can’t wait for it to hit the solo pvp dream.
---
Yes, but if you look at the flow chart this is more about people who complain vocally but do nothing. I have spent a great deal of my free time camping bots forcing them to stay docked, sometimes 50 or more at a time.

Very bad idea.

FW is in lowsec ... and lowsec don't have gate connection to Stain.

You don't want to live in lowsec without such gate. 
---
I'm glad you're having fun. And I sincerely hope it goes on forever! These size fights are very much EVE at its best.
---
But I can't help being sad remembering that this is the way nearly every part of null used to be. It was the *norm* instead of something worthy of a Reddit post saying "Hey guys, we still have some fun in EVE! Come join us for the few minutes it's going on before INIT or Snuff or PL or Goons or all four crush the life out of all of us!"

Thank you &lt;3

The corporation whose alliance couldn't evict a small Australian corporation from their system and had to literally flee Rancer with their tails between their legs is now in Pandemic Legion... WTF!?
---
This is the same corporation whose CEO lost an Aeon in a tower that was sieged, his Aeon having no fuel and was not tackled for a couple of minutes and yet still died. IT COULD HAVE WARPED OUT.
---
I swear this must be an April's Fools joke. It has to be &gt;_&lt;

It's not bad, but you cut your number of potential fights pretty significantly. Sometimes you'll slide into 4 or 5 plexes in a row and see nothing but purples

Shut the fuck up, of course it's stupid you daft mong

The 1st one is free.

meh. its all a numbers game. previously ppl called the so called "elite" groups out for not adapting to the meta of spod and numbers. today ppl call the same groups out for recruiting "numbers". the whole discussion is pretty worthless.

Look ma i got friends!

I am the gate and I confirm NC sucks

Not to take away from anything you guys are doing. In its own why I'm alittle jelly about your fights and always want to bring a fleet over of 30-40 just to 3rd party. But ik if I did I would kill content for a lot of people and I will always love what 100-200 active pilots in a small/medium alliance can do. I watch PB for battle repost and for post lie this where it's nothing more then a 
---
"We are having fun, hope you are too" 
---
As for the loses you pointed out. When you have 10 people each lose 1 cap you don't notice. But when you have 1-2 out there time and time again losing using and losing caps. You take a minute and admire the pilot or 2. That's all he was doing. Because it's pilots like that that really show the character of those pilots. They are here for the fun and don't care about pixels. Hates off to the guy that's lose 11 and just keeps going without looking back. I wish eve had 50,000 more people like you 
---
As for the "why u lose 2 trillion, I could have taken half the north with that isk" 
---
No you couldn't because your cap fleet would get wiped out at the first keepstar by gotg. It's the mega coalitions that fight over keepstars but small/med alliance that bring the most fun to the daily lives of their membership with forts and tataras. 
---
Local banter is eve. I do it to PH when I'm up there. It's part of the game. I or no one I know holds any real ill will to them as PH. Just them as a organization. Take the banter as part of this game that has some amazing moments and others way more boring. 
---
This post in its own right is nothing more then a reminder that both sides have kept it's more or less a bunch of smaller alliances fighting each other and not bringing in a coalition to hold there hand which is what you should be proud of. Yes we show up from time to time.  Hard not to when we passing by and see a Fort in final timer. We get interested. That's eve. 
---
10 bil a month means nothing. How many hours farming?

yeah except there are 200+ ranger regiment on the BR linked above.

the guys mindlessly grinding lvl4 missions in HS in a raven navy issue 5years ago, rat in supers nowadays

nothing wrong with looking for handouts

most of the time it is player vs Concord. 
---
It s not the first hotdrop in goon space and not the last. 
---
But really put some tank on nyx next time, it s almost impossible to loose a nyx under goon umbrella if you are ready to get fucked. Mine is low tank, no umbrella and still alive after a long long time.

DONT rat in super if local is not blue.....except for baiting

Oh really?

Not nice for the bastion this

Geezus, these guys are shit.
---
And that's coming from a Goon.
---
I'd love to see something with the quality of the trailers that reflects the reality of how fleet combat works. I'm not talking the big tidi titan brawls, but the more modest fights with less than 200 ships on grid. Something that lasts minutes but results in tens of billions lost. 
---
INIT does make nice video's, but it funny that they are still the butt boy's of Goon's who need the attention.
---
He didn't even use his NSA.
---
The fact that the sanc npcs did most of the damage is just extra amusing.
---
"It's all good." is it tho
---
Delve is safe to rat they say... you are not going to get dropped they say
---
Fucked indeed for the fucked (ur nothing else once you're insde that bubble), amazing for the bystanders I'd say tbh.
---
Give it a year and hedliners destruction of PL will be complete.

As far as I can tell it still is huge. Most of the best in systems I've visited in high sec seem to get stripped daily.

npcs strip them btw

What’s the thing with Stain lately
---
I know it’s the home of our lord and savior Sansha Kuvakei but I don’t understand why 
---
Are there boosh Ravens for me to watch in wide-eyed amazement?
---
good way to start is to do the introduction missions (The Seekers on the Agency Tab) once you finish all 5 introduction missions, you can do the Sisters of Eve Epic Arc.
---
That should give you a decent idea of all the different aspects of EVE, from there I'd suggest buying 10 or so frigates and moving into lowsec and trying to find fight with them. 
---
That should take you a week or so and while your doing all of that you can find a group to fly with. If you feel like you need more information to get started you can sign up with EVE University, or hit up one of the null sec alliances to see if they have a newbro starting plan
---
Was expecting hyperspatial ratting titan, meh...
---
Its a launcher...you look at it for 3 seconds before logging into the game - maybe instead of all this bullshit and hot air, you just get a life and get on with it?
---
Not sure whether I'm being flair bated or not.
---
Anyways, you better step up your game then. Get some nerds together and do some fleet ratting. Can't be that hard if you just need 6 logi.
---
The thing is that is quiet and full of moon mining rorquals ......

&gt;you look at it for 3 seconds before logging into the game

It's hard to tell with Wally. He was kicked from one corp for streaming a fight w/ comms included, then fucked up by streaming command channel in another corp, wasting an op. 
---
Hard to tell where the trolling stops and the wally begins. 
---
Remember when PL invited the elite gatecamp corp Tundragon in order to poach Dalman. The difference here is R1OT don't have even a single redeeming quality.
---
Oh i am totally enthusiastic with his work.        
---
He is a perfect example how one player can ... hmmm... let say that i am waiting for him posting on reddit how 10 years ago PL killed his super and he devoted all his gameplay since then to join the alliance and from elite pvp hunters turn it to elite pve hunting group full of industrial corporations.             
---
If he just disband the alliance - well people could reform in -10**.** but killing all the heritage. 
---

almost like a narrative base on "huuuh we are 3K player and we are fighting equal a 40k alliance" scrambling right ? :p

swing and a miss on my part. Forgot about fake querious and if it's an olmeca gank he was like dragged into an online cyno inhib. Not much he could've done aside from DScanning the sites he was going to. Which oddly, in my experiance krabs generally do this to avoid having to warp off an already claimed site and prevent that from cutting into their ticks.

who are frt's masters?

I thought R1OT were just a recruitment scam corp tbh lol

I went the opposite direction. When I finally decided I wanted to do PvP I went straight into the Militia at everyone's suggestion. But after being killed multiple times by Militia members I realized, if I just became a pirate and shot everyone then my target base would expand.

What was the problem with RTSQ?  Honest question, is there a thread about it or something?
---
The Orca has two big advantages. First, an extra-large ore hold (150000 m3 base). Very handy, especially as an alt.
---
Second is boosts. Not as good as a Rorq, but better than a Porpoise.
---
Spec-wise, it's a fraction of a Rorq, but it's also a fraction of the price and SP.
---
If you only have a single character, drone mining from an Orca isn't that great -- though there are people who use it that way semi-AFK, due to the large ore hold.
---
ditto Stainguy, ditto
---
Thanks, that's Bastion though.  Are they on the deployment together?  I haven't been following the news really.
---
so.. is there a rule that i can't reply to my own post? and for fuck sake. i don't have an alt.

plenty of ppl that started &lt;2 years ago and are (read: were) considered top players.
---
"by killing goons you actually help goons".

I totally agree.

ok, pl is making some "wise" choices but i want to draw the attention to something different.

FFS STAINGUY, DO YOU HAVE PL'S DOTLAN PAGE ON YOUR FAVORITES OR SOMETHING

I just want a launcher that remembers window positions. How hard could it be to emulate isboxer really...

you forgot AVRSE &amp; Elitist Ops -  btw the guys are much less toxic than expected, maybe it was the old alliance and not the corps responsible for this reputation ?

If we wanted friends we wouldn't be playing EVE.

The real question is why there are only medium sized Merc and ice rigs. The endurance and prospect want some live too.

Combat interceptors are no longer nullified, but tackle interceptors and appropriately configured T3 cruisers both still are immune to bubbles -- as well as the Luxury Yacht, of course.

You should have seen him 25 minutes later using his rattle in a site, dude was using his drones to kill battleships and his cruise missiles  to kill the frigates, while explaining to his viewers that the missiles apply better then the light drones in his drone bay to small ships. It was fucking amazing.
---
I thought that was why people collected corpses?
---
Thanks I updated it. You no longer have to put in the port number.
---
I'm curious. Is the army attracts such sort of people or does it make them into this sort of people?
---
This guy makes goon line members look like Mensa members.
---
Pretty sure that's us (TEST) slugging it out with Pandemic Horde over market hub Azbels and Keepstars. I'm guessing this was in Perimeter or one of the other systems close to Jita?
---
If that were true we'd be feeding 10 times as many supers every day.
---
Has time to trill but can't find someone on a BR, thought Brave Newbies had their own sub 
---
Because when they are dumb enough to block nothing on screen and not be in coms you're gonna get to watch them become content if you wait long enough.
---
LP is worth alot in amarr/caldari  , its not enough to make up for the fact that you earn alot less of it but its enough to fly poorfit frigates and dessies comfortably 
---
join amarr we are a fun bunch but we need more people to fight the chinkfarmer menace 
---
No, but you can scan down things like MTUs, Mobile Depots and lost drones or fighters.
---
Or, if you have a cooperative player, just follow them around and salvage after they finish running a site.
---
I wonder if they're going to put out another one called "EVE Online - How to betray friends [Tutorial]" and explain how to empty corporate hangers and wallets?
---
Maybe follow it up with "EVE Online - How to ignore in-game consequences" and then show how the person who stole everything in the last episode how they can extract all their skillpoints and roll another character to put them into, at a tidy profit to CCP.

He was banned from discord for being an unbearable, selfish, idiot.

He was banned from the game (most recently) for RMTing, ostensibly to noraus.

No tank nyx ofc 
---
Sure, there are items on the market all the time that have a 10%+ margin between component purchases price and sell price. BPCs purchased using loyalty points is one area you might look into.
---
However, prices fluctuate, along with supply and demand. Finding and quickly serving those niches is part of the game. There are tools like "Isk per Hour," although in my experience they tend to be pretty hit-or-miss.
---
In addition to building, research, copying and invention can also be profitable ways to apply lots of capital.
---
We just don't want Panfam to have a midpoint upon Pure blind, in range of Cloud ring.
---
Panfam was forming for this, they stood down when they saw our caps. 
---
You mean like the Fortizar 1000k off the current Staging Station in NPC-Space?
---
http://www.verite.space/maps/influence/
---
Sorry, forgot to mention they get archived daily!
---
So let me educate you on the conflict at hand here siphoner. 
---
In terms of the fighting happening in Pure Blind right now, Triumvirate goes into every single fight outnumbered bar a few.
---
You want some evidence for this Ill show you. 
---
We have [https://gyazo.com/99ec0ec042af7418fd149d5e8785e367](https://gyazo.com/99ec0ec042af7418fd149d5e8785e367) 200 active PvP pilots. + Our wombat Bros.     
---

---
Now for the other side, In my case the hostiles. But I'll be as unbiased as i can here
---
[https://gyazo.com/4047c5abeef202a93500c2fac45d176d](https://gyazo.com/4047c5abeef202a93500c2fac45d176d) The french, 105

---
So lets figure out the combat effectiveness of each side. 
---
200 Pilots out of 500. Thats 40% For TRI
---
41 Pilots out of 400 is 10% for Wombat. 
---
this leads to 241/900 **Thats 26% Combat effective**. 
---
Now For the Mini Coalition. 
---
100 pilots out of 500, for FXR is 20%
---
166 Pilots out of 1000 For RU. is 16%
---
61   Pilots out of 325 For Olds is 18%
---
That leads to 332/1800 **Which is 18% Combat effective.** 
---
So in fact the little guys has roughly 90 more active PvPers. Making them not the little guy.
---
This has lead to a number of fights where we have been outnumbered. 
---

We have also had some very nice 50 vs 50 100v100 Fights where when they haven't batphoned imperium.

Now I will go out on a limb and say that outside small gang objectives, I mean in fleet fights over structures and entosis timers, I dont think these 3 alliances on their own have won against us. NOW thats not saying that we havent lost, we have lost, but its been at the hands of init and Snuff and Darkness and Goons. 
---
All this being said, The content is amazing and I hope it continues, If not for Timezone tank these 3 alliances wouldnt have any sov left. But nevertheless it is prolonging the fights.  
---
I hope my analysis has helped you understand the fighting in Pure Blind, and that your views on the subject are a little misplaced. 
---
Cool story, bro, but why you seem to be more salty than they guy who lost his Nyx? It's a game that has pvp and pve combined. Someone has to shoot rats and mine ore to keep economy engine felled and some of those people need to be dumb so you - The Elite Pvper (tm) get some killmails. I'm not sure if making eve more dangerous would bring more killmails. I, myself, would rather not rat in my super / titan at all than accept fact that I'm outside supercap umbrella.  
---
&gt; he tried over heating his fighters guns
---
....how does one even attempt that? 
---
it is good to the point that I was in the Old School channel talking to them about the fights we were having everyday :)
---
There is still demand for synth boosters. You can see exactly how much on the market tab.
---
Making them can be a reasonable way to get an introduction to Reactions. I wouldn't expect to make much isk, though, especially if you have to buy the input materials and if you're building them without nullsec bonuses.
---
you get 500k SP*  
---
^in ^500000 ^dialy ^payments ^of ^1 ^sp^omegastaterequired
---
proof that goons can have 1000supers, but maybe 10 dudes that could actually use one in a pvp fight.
---
Or the one 2 jumps out in X47
---
I hope they also integrate them into the client, I love linking them in local hidden as killmails and other peoples computers freeze/game crashes.
---
Nothing.        
---
Like totally there is no problem in RTSQ, they are specific group of players quite good on what they do.        
---
They will camp gates harass some area in 3-10 man gangs drop some dreads together from time to time.       
---
Most of them plays in the same TZ.          
---
This is a good post, thanks for writing it
---
Were banderlogs fighting old school before tri arrived?
---
You cant put a leash on the chinese sometimes, Tri has had a dread brawl or two with them in PB too :D
---
No people link me this stuff ingame, on reddit, on discord.        
---
You could be surprised what kind of sick things i see somedays. 
---
how to find friends?  oh god thats not going to be good.....
---
that entire video should have a disclaimer about friends in eve 
---
"warning, "friends" may betray you, be scammers, or have other ill intent"    isn't that like rule #2?
---
&lt;3
---
Today, every star is now a loki.

be careful what you wish for, moa was killing goonies 2/4/7

sadly, mission running included.

I had baaaad feeling that it will be more like **"EVE Online - How to mine with friends utilizing multiple alt accounts"**
---
Hi olmeca i see you e upgraded from excavators to supers good on you. Also please kill more plebs.
---
Most inefficient RMT scheme of all time.
---
What happened to MoA?
---
They had to be *super elite* to kill this no cyno, no NSA super that warped into their anchored bubble.  And it couldn't *possibly* have been done in subcaps.
---
Need both the trackers on - the yellow arrows next to system name and on your character name itself
---
It might take them a day.
---
I saw a bot enter the permiter keepstar
---
Rule 1: it's always a scam
---
Rule 2: Never trust anyone
---
Rule 3: it's always a cyno
---
Rule 4: it's always a scam
---
Coming from a goon. 
---
This guy is a fucking idiot, no fleet no comms, no attempt to call for help.
---
i thought rule 1 was "your ship is dead. even when you first buy it
---
&gt;IRAQ combat veteran
---
I wonder how he lived so long and didn't just lie down in some trench during a shootout saying "I'm dead anyway doesn't matter if air support is coming..."
---
Rule 0: always take the bait
---
Nah. I know one guy that's had the same rolling Bhaalgorn for over 14 months
---
Never not take the bait
---
Caveat- but I ow what they're gonna hit you with
---
Coming from a fellow goon:
---
1. No tank
---
2. No tank rigs
---
3.  No fleet
---
4. No attempt to call for help
---
5. NOT EVEN SHIELD TANKED COME THE FUCK ON DUDE!!!
---
&gt;that players **including** goons
---
&gt;Why single out goons
---
....*pulls out the torpedo delivery form* whats his name, and home dock station, we need to fix that xD
---
If a ship has a Target Size &lt; 1.08, it will not be probe-able, even with max skills.
---
Target Size = sig radius / sensor strength.
---
There are a few things you can do to decrease sig radius and/or increase sensor strength. Whether it's possible to reach 1.08 or less depends on your skills and the specific ship.
---
It's still dead, it's just taking it a long time to realise it.
---
I'd tell you, but youd just end up catching/killing mine :(
---
Wow, thanks for posting about it on reddit! Will be sure to deploy our big null block sigs there to third party on everything and bring fleets half the size of your alliances!
---
I really interested in, from what sources you get "2 trilion ISK". If you open killboard you will see 822kkk for Jan and Feb. If you adding our looses on moveops it's pretty weird.
---
I don't want to dive deep in buttphone count, my opinion is that Olds, Banderlogs and French can fight with us without calling Init, Snuff or Skill. Just think about, what if we start asking for help NC., PL or Chinese each and single time? Instead of GF we would have lags in 1500 local for citadel that cost 10 bils. I don't think that there should be any kind of strategic mode, since region is about PvP, not about rental program.
---
So, If we are not talking about "strategic mode", what kind of progress you expect from 500-man alliance from EU-US timezone in timezone-tanked timers, where on 50% EUTZ timers there are Snuff/Init fleet on standby? We having good fights, this game about this isn't it? 
---
About aggressive PvP and other shit. It's good that you have money in way, that you can play Eve for 14 hours per day. Most of our alliance players can play only 1-2 hours after work. So you shouldn't expect 24/7 undock games or scanres camping from us. Over there, it may shock you, but this is not gameplay that we like in Alliance. We are trying to create timers and form proper fleets, instead of trying to catch some random travelers in bubles. And we are not using vexor ratting bots trying to keep adm high \0/ .
---
All this smack talks in local is only about Init full fleet on our citadel or Snuff capitals in range on every big EUTZ timer. I'm pretty sure that no one from our alliance seriously insulting you. If they do - just show logs. We would ask those guys to stop. Our alliance culture is about respecting both friends and rivals. 
---
PL mods "removed" the post from the main view ;)
---
woop woop 
---
I'm confused, what does being a Vet have to do with video games? 
---
No disrespect to veterans and all that but this just seems a weird place to advertise that 
---
I usually login and check my pi alts, then I switch to my main and probe alt. Dscan for any targets, kill targets and dock up. At some point someone throws me a convo, asking if I can help them kill something bigger, two man fleet grows as more friends logon and we end up with a lot of gfs, my alt smartbombs a few pods in her proteus and I log onto my alt to do some abyssals before bed.
---
could also be the prelimenarys to burn jita :^) 
---
Absolutely nothing. And he makes the rest of us look like attention hungry whores.
---
A better rebalance would probably be to remove the drone mining rigs.
---
Yeah... I wanted to do some Sansha mission when I started. Always liked the whole atmosphere of the Nation.
---
Sadly, a lot of the corporations you meet in Stain are Russians, and don’t really want to speak with strangers, even less when they don’t understand or write in Cyrillic alphabet.
---
1 SP down 499,999 more to go. Take 1 down and pass it around.....
---
&gt; 20 seconds
---
Good grief, imagine the extra masturbation you could squeeze in with all that spare time? 
---
hehe.
---
funny thing is, i still got a hurricane that....sheesh idk how old it is.  its from the days when having 2 auto cannons and 4 artillery was considered acceptable.
---
found it in a lowsec stations and still plannign to bring it to jita for a "you survived time itself" mothball 
---
It’s super cringey. Did my time and if people are interested I talk. Otherwise who cares. 
---
Vet btw btw. 
---
&gt; I can't be on comms, you guys will hear everything  
---
Can't even twitch properly
---
thank you for your service. 
---
Plex tank you pleb !
---
Sounds more like sarcasm.
---
"How to find friends" *heavy breathing*
---
mm very nice
---
hakonen POS and a few caps down in the same evening? nice.
---
As a loan shark...
---
He actually undocks in his supercarrier and risks it. You only gank ratters and the most you ever risk is a HIC.
---
You're the pleb.
---
You mean like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGplrpWvz0I
---
Really take his blue cord for being bad at eve. 
---
twitch vod seems to be gone, did anyone grab a mirror?
---
Yep, but i‘m pretty sure he‘s talking about one specific
---
Because fuck you and the mining barge you rode in on.
---
For all his faults, I still felt bad for the streamer.  At least he says that it’s all his fault.
---
Reading the post, I feel even worse for OP.  The level of self-victimization for his own choice of pastime activity is somewhat ironic.  
---
Ending with something like “I wish we could all just get along” on a post created specifically to brag and whine at the same time makes me think he’s stupid and needy for attention all the same as the streamer, just in a different way.
---
I am not getting any. Have CCP distributed the free SP yet?
---
This is kind of specific to Pandemic Horde life:  
---
1. Log in, check discord pings
---
2. Figure out if there is a mining fleet. Decide if I want to mine
---
3. Look at the corp web site to see when the next scheduled operation is
---
4. Decide if I want to join standing fleet and gate camp or larp around
---
5. Go solo ratting
---
6. Yell at my friends playing Apex
---
7. Repeat steps 2-5
---
17 Billion fitted nyx ..... soon  it will be cheaper to give minerals away instead of selling them.
---
"Iraq Combat Veteran" plastered over his stream, figures he's a babykilling imperialist too LMAO
---
praise bob, bro, praise bob

That is one of the most lopsided ass beatings I've ever seen. Impressive. Though PL is showing in the wrong column.

There was once a gif with verite map from 2008 to recent days. Maybe someone has a link to it.

Back in the day when an alliance war chest had the same amount of rorquals as your average line member.
---
That could have helped 
---
"get fucked pleb, now gobble up this shit!"
---
FTFY
---
Good.
---
that counts members on paper, fleet sizes rarely go above the 150 mark for both sides, you can check the BRs :p
---
Is martini even a thing still? Legit haven't heard any dribble from him in a hot minute 
---
Shut the fuck up !
---
not the moons.
---
Amen to that.
---
This looks like our fight in New Caldari yesterday. (:
---
That's why there are 0.5 systems with 20 orcas mining at the same time consistently.
---
Should've at least waited for a BR with Init and Goons on it. You'll probably miss out on a lot of potential karma now ...
---
Trailer involved Subcaps doing stuff = Trailer wasn't realistic
---
That is actually a good proposition to combat the "Rorqual menace" lol
---
They would still be the ultimate mining ship, but the gape between them and Exhumers wouldn't be so pronounced has it is now. O.o
---
Albeit I'm not sure CCP is really looking forward to "fix" this "issue".
---
CCPlease is supposed to be little things and QOL stuff IIRC. That'd leave the big stuff (like the upwell structures and abyssal stuff for example) for eve updates.
---
We'll have to wait and see how they actually do things, I guess.
---
&gt;when making any argument, and especially when attempting to "mock" someone else's, it helps to have even just a basic understanding of what you're talking about :\^)
---
It's also really helpful to not use stupid arguments. This didn't stop him though.   
---
It's also helpful to have an argument in the first place. That didn't stop you either. 
---
Abyssals can also be run in WHs, but it's highly recommended to have an alt watching your trace. Even with connections crit and an alt watching, it's still risky because anyone could roll into your wh, scan the trace, and have a few cruisers/BCs sitting on it long before you exit the abyss.
---
I agree... I see why this used to be the case, Barges and Exhumers were the ultimate/ right answer for every mining problem, but right now, with the T2 Ventures, Barges and Exhumers aren't the only good answer anymore.
---
If the guy wasn't literally braindead he would never be in any danger at all, that's the point.
---
Wormhole industry made my ISK after i got a few bil via wormhole exploration. 
---
Try Good Sax.

I give it a 52,7% chance you're a wormholer btw whose salted wound has not healed yet.

Thanks! It is 😁

Aww bb 720p? :( Still though great video.
---
Our second operation to move some ships to our deployment location (our deployment is against several alliances, one of them called NC.) was "dropped" on (i.e. got ships tossed at it to kill it) by NC. and got slaughtered by them.

I don’t understand ._.
---
inb4 someone starts linking deaths during deployments as a proof
---
Thanks Olmeca, good post.
---
some hulks or makinaws like to try and fit a tank. because of this, id say bring 2 friends.
---
3 catalyts can ensure the hulk or mak dies, and then you somtimes get another one dead-ed before yo run out of time. - my biggest advise - have a DST waiting to wapr in and scoop loot. the mining ships wont fit enough points to point you in hisec, (+2 warp core stability to DST's) and when you loot and go yellow flashy you get out fine, you can recycle the gank ship loot and often grab some expensive mining drones and modules people fit to those things.
---
like expensive mining lasors
---
Fix Cap proliferation, Not more tutorials. If this game doesn’t change its direction in a few months I’m leaving for good. The Meta is stale and I’ve only started playing 3 years ago and I’m already bored of it.

2 weeks

Recruiting Bastion to Init was a good move i guess?!?!??
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=arPBxfDhMwY
---
i was in a BNI fleet, rails ofc. we went up against a larger more number fleet of snuffed macherials (we were going to get shredded for sure)
---
we get on grid about to just yolo in a fight the machs, and snuffed drop HAW dreads and a FAX. and thus we then warp off and leave, the fight was not strategical btw.
---
:(
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGrNJmMq9Ug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGrNJmMq9Ug)
---
Faxes are really in a tough place. They are super powerful when used to rep subcaps. Part of me thinks they should apply reps sig based.
---
The pet status between Init and Goon is strong and well define, no need to wait for another BR we all know it. 
---
&gt; s direction in a few months I’m leaving for good. The Meta is stale and I’ve only started playing 3 y
---
Only 3years and already bored? Absolutelly unacceptable! I remember back in my days, we used to play one game 20 years minimum!
---
nah, it's the flair.
---
also same for mine.
---
I don't see how INIT, Snuff, PL or Goons are crushing the life out of it, TRI had 20+ titans, 1 full region, lost 9 titans, rest were routed. Its a shame they fell from being right up there with the rest of the serial evictors, but such is the way of EVE. Alliances are now about titan numbers and quality of region inhabited, adapt or perish. Pure Blind and Venal are where alliances go when they are 1 major corp theft away from disbanding in my opinion.
---
I‘m gonna move an interceptor with a target painter where you’re deploying so I can get on all the killmails so reddit has something to meme about.
---
In fact no
---
Emm... Yes... why?
---
&gt;I wonder if they pull a PGL and say the campaign hasn't started yet...
---
 We still waiting Test campaign ...
---
It's Fake Querious, so Delve.
---
can i have your stuff?
---
Hero we need, but not the one we deserve!
---
No need, it's already common knowledge that Goons have sponsored and paid for this deployment.

Don't Panic.

My day? It depends, some days I'll be in W-space or Null, hacking sites. 
---
Other times I'll be running an event site. 
---
I dabble in market trading to pay for ships, and I recently got into PI and Industry to help with that. I'll check Discord and the corp forums for interesting topics and say hi to the newbros and newsisses. 
---
The number is much lower but I cannot believe you are getting downvoted for pointing out deaths of civilians caused by a war that was based on manufactured evidence. EVE 2019?
---
Big on hype. Short on delivery.
---
Can I have your stuff?

There's a new girl in there now as well that joined for vegas. I don't remember her name tho

And you know he's not on comms, because you are on comms 🤣

There is a large contingent of US military people who play EVE who never, ever cease to shut the fuck up about the fact that they are in the military. 
---
I mean, him raging at his viewers for rightfully calling him an idiot after he did absolutely everything wrong in this situation is not exactly "relaxed" 
---
It's interesting how quickly dumb fucks on this sub went from saying "init is so cool, very independent, one of the best alliances in the game" to "haha lol goon pets, brisc rubal, such shit, ROFL ecks dee"
---
Fucking  two different holes of same woman by 2 Mans in same time is showing in same br for me ;d

Pff, it is absolutely unironically my favourite fleet comp in EVE.  Particularly in that I've never flown it.

you complain about CCPs "Ultrabad Mechanics" then proceed to admit you use tools not provided in game to "provide content" "or make space less safe for these guys"
---
I personally could give a fuck less about these Alliances and their supers, Rorqs, or protective umbrellas. But spending your life finding ways to stop them seems sad, especially if you are 
---
realizing you need to cheat to do it...
---
rats interfering in pvp have always been utterly stupid and infuriating mechanics in this game.
---
How to find friends... FeelsBadMan
---
Zoomer pop music and a mashup from a bunch of old eve videos is now considered the to be ''fantastic'' and ''amazing'' ? LOL
---
I think this good for PL. Back to their roots. Maybe let BDCI know: no titans or supers on the gate camp, and the gate camping could be good for them. 
---
did not expect anything else, in fact i posted it to see how many RL koolaid drinkers will downvote ...
---
&gt;How do i get 100% scanning strength?

The irony of someone asking for 100% scanning strength with the name Swamp Donkey.

I fear for all the inebriated men out there.😊
---
when lee chanka posts on reddit lmbo
---
This guy keeps inviting me into his channel and trying to sell me things, avoid this scammer.
---
ayyyyyy
---
I see you're still salty about that fort loss? 
---
also must fly a bomber too. 
---
No, they expect one of us at the wreckage brother.
---
It's an accomplishment. Take pride, even if it does annoy the rest of us.
---
Nope
---
But what would you make reddit posts about then
---
inb4 CryHavoc. 2.0 is created.
---
How much of which compressed ore to build a rorq? Looking for cheapest option
---
Hedliner is a hero, what are you talking about?

Doubt it, against any real opposition they have a tendency to just go home.

Nice

Boy you sure got a pretty wet mouth
---
Hard to complain about our reddit posting when we're living rent free in your heads. I think we're up to 3 posts a day trying to meme on people hunting Delve ratters. At this point, I'm flattered.
---
I casually make about 200-250k LPs per week in the amarr FW as a side effect of PVP and using plexes to find fights. That earns me about 400m ISKs per week.
---
You can do a double sebo malediction with ungrouped missiles, shoot at nerds from 120km. You don't do any damage but you get on a km. 
---
Wouldn't even raise an eyebrow, there are init supers and titans ratting in delve as we speak. 
---
he should call in bombers' bar to help him

This article is full of blatant lies and false pretenses. After reading the OP, Pure Blind outsiders and casual readers might think outnumbered but heroic (aggressive, Pro PVP) alliance is fight uphill battle against coalition of others alliance for control of the region.  
---
As someone said once, truth is a deep dark water sometimes, however in this case OP forgot to mention some crucial facts:
---
1.) TR is 2 tier alliance, all supporting and logistic alts are in VIRUS alliance, 423 members ([https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99003916/](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99003916/))
---
2.) Upon TRI’s arrival in PB (3rd week of December 2018), Olds where already fighting SOV war with “Muppet Coalition” for over a month (Weekend Warriors, Caldari Militia, Conifers and Fishermans etc)
---
3.) TRI had over 800 members upon arrival, now 502
---
4.) TRI had a spy posing as a friend in Olds, so the first few days Olds were chilling TRI fleets “believing” we would be blue once things are sorted out (Never trust people who claim that they are “god among the men”)
---
5.) French Conexxion is later addition to PB coalition (on Olds and Banderlogs side), and timeline wise it coincidences with the arrival of Combat Wombat to support TRI
---
6.) TRI is regulary asking Ranger Regiment (3693), Iron Armada (316) for help:
---
[https://zkillboard.com/related/30002000/201902171400/o/%7B](https://zkillboard.com/related/30002000/201902171400/o/%7B)"A"%3A%5B"933731581%5C%2F"%2C"99007090%5C%2F"%5D%2C"B"%3A%5B"99007916%5C%2F"%2C"1603281980%5C%2F"%5D%7D/
---
7.)  TRIs claim about always fighting outnumbered (Eoghan\_Macc in particular) is so false,  that simple fact find mission about those 11 lost Nidhoggurs from Raging Tempest can unearth the real truth:
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/75263236/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75263236/)
---
Raging has bigger balls then all of you combined.  
---
Just hours before, your SC fleet run away from local when single olds pilot appeared in the system:
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/30001972/201902200600/
---
You don’t deserve to hold any SOV. Garst will be gone again (or his Credit Card will run dry), and you will be all gone to Panfarm.  
---
Good job Arrow.
---
he also notanked his super, lower your expectations.
---
just point me to the liquor table!
---
How many stealth bombers do you need to total a titan?
---
I think people are assuming he means that he would donate in favor of killing civilians.
---
Well I mean there was the big “look at me” thread from you know who this morning
---
joke's on you getting punched in the face is my kink
---
yeah but the metrics guys don't know that :P
---
For statistics purposes it is querious.
---
you're right it's exactly the same
---
Standing by to process the order! 
---
Never expected that Komodo can be used on botting 
---
Are the difficulty rankings of Combat Sites [here](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Combat_sites#Combat_anomalies) still correct? I have an active shield VNI with Navy Wasps, but mostly T1 fittings (and a T2 Shield boost), and even in nullsec Guristas Hidden Dens I have to warp out 2 or 3 times before I can clear the site. Is this just a skill/fit issue, a piloting issue, or is this list borked?
---
Woof, TRI is down to 511 members?  That's a shame tbh.  All jokes about reddit posting aside, they made a lot of good stuff happen in the last 2 years of nullsec.
---
ok so what point are you trying to make? 
---
Why this post so upset?  The streamer's decisions all led to you being able to play the game how you want to.  Is it just ship envy?  
---
cancel delivery. the address doesn't match =(
---
wheres the proof?
---
Could just use a mantihore and whore from 300k out with gatling lazors
---
still waiting for you to come back after you ran away
---
I have to admit i just watched the twitch part of him getting killed ... i later saw the youtube part with the ... not chilling thing ... but i was too lazy to edit my reddit post ... sry :D most of the things about how he died and what he's doing is still valid .... put the relaxing part into brackets it is still partially working ;)
---
This is the best post you've ever made olmeca. Spod Bless.
---
What you said sounds ambiguous as fuck... You can't social experiment people with inconcise grammar...
---
First you need to know wich components build the rorq before you can figure out wich materials you need. From that you can figure out wich ore would be the most efficient. I dont have the schematics at hand but i doubt you have enough with just ore.
---
Good for the economy
---
Please show us where /u/Pandoralica touched you
---
who are you again?
---
Mining needs to be focused again on barges and exhumers. I would be ok with getting rid of excavators if you buff the Rorqual boosts to allow a couple of exhumers to mine a similar amount as a Rorqual does now. The Rorq should NOT be the only ship in null sec used for mining.
---
It does this about a lot of subjects, pl/nc/horde shit/not shit, pet hierarchy and whether horde is an exploited shithole or nice newbro group off the top of my head.
---
Didn't you feed munnins to stukas the last time init tackled nc rorqs
---
YOU CAN’T TRICK ME THIS TIME BORIS
---
Notanked. Is this a strat?
---
Beats the hell out of the krabbing and tidi-fests in my past few years. Great place for constant action right now
---
The rumors are true.  So true infact that olds evac'd to the safety of 5zxx where French connexion and banderlogs are both living. Go check out x70 in pureblind there isnt a single olds in x70 right now.
---
I also took a look at recent fights and tri has been wiping the floor with olds/banderlogs/frenchcomnexion/wild boars combine fleets while being outnumbered at minimum 2-1 the last few fleet vs fleet  engagements I looked up. They are losing the fights  init goons and snuff bring 300 man gangs each to protect olds. Unless I'm missing something here, that sounds pretty good to me and it sounds fun too
---
If pureblind didn't suck so much dick and I had a slightest desire to even consider ever living there again, I know which alliance I'd be joining. And it wouldnt be olds boars French or banderlogs
---
yes, there are 3 people who do this in the entire game, and it doesn't come close to the THOUSANDS of people who used to mine in highsec daily.
---
irrelevant, he wasn't talking about moons
---
The eve uni site is still regularly updated. Guristas weakness is thermal and your navy wasps do kinetic damage. Youre better off using gallente drones, hammerheads for example. Then its just a matter of getting your skills to atleast lvl 4.
---
New Russian Coalition is okay for me
---
Same as any other russian coalition
---

yeah it's just i'm tired of ccp making it harder to do the same activity i've done countless times for literally no reason other than incompetence 
---
Aren't these vids in the f12 menu? Under tutorial videos?
---
Lol
---
Not really related to what we're talking about here but sure.
---
I can't name a time when people weren't calling everyone goons pets that were in the imperium that weren't goons. 
---
Though I think it changed mainly for init when they went to "do their own thing" then suddenly massive amounts of goons show up.
---
You are amazing. Not for this kill, I mean, as you point out yourself achieving this super kill was no amazing feat. Instead, I call you amazing because you, at one and the same time, seem to be:
---
1. Telling us how easy it was to kill the 'stupid pleb'; while
---
2. Trying to turn your post into some QQ post about how 'hard' it is to kill capitals; then
---
3. Try to insinuate that this ratter is indicative of an entire alliance; and
---
4. Bragging about it like it was some tremendous illustration of your elite 'pvp' skill; while
---
5. Failing to point out how incredibly 'selective' you are with your targets (I doubt you'd drop on a Thanatos in Delve if you thought it had a tank); then
---
6. Make fun of the dude for not having an alt army;
---
7. While admitting that you are either paid by Putin or use daddy's trust fund to have your own alt army; and
---
8. Complain about 'harassment' by 'reddit warriors';
---
9. When what the actual fuck do you think you are doing right now; oh that's right
---
10. Harassing some PTSD looking former soldier who streams with a reddit warrior post. 
---
Well tbf, we have mostly avoided the AUTZ stuff, so a lot of our fleets lately have been purely content fleets through Null/Low directs or roams. We only just put the best color on dotlan a few days ago so it's understandable we might not be mentioned too much. Although it was us + cal mil who originally started all of this with OLDS, had some really nice fights then as well. 
---
Grrr russians
---
The Fake news bears ? 
---
Yup
---
Thanks stranger, good luck with the delve camping and whatnot
---
Don't think it has been done, don't think it can be done unless Titan is afk or something?
---
Rip
---
As a major miner, I would totally be in favor of this. I was much happier back when I was mining in my excavators. Mining was a much more chill operation, and you could carve out a decent career for yourself without needing multi-billion isk ships and fittings.
---
No Radakos, just... No.

It's okay to feed my guy, it's just part of the game. Let it happen and enjoy it for what it is.

when did people here ever call init so good?
---
I know right?? Fielding 4-5b of drones per rorq that can be killed in a few seconds of inattention isn’t exactly my cup of tea.
---
And then I could just sell the damn things and let others do the mining, as I’m just a minmaxer with no attention span

I’ll give my stuff to the guy who commented first. I’ll PM you when I’m ready to leave

The medium rigs for Merc &amp; Ice only came into existence after the tiericide of Mining Barges/Exhumers.
---
The Skiff used to get a Merco Bonus, with the Mack receiving an Ice mining bonus, and Hulk was just kind of yield.
---
When they reblanced they for Tank / Cargo / Yield respectively they moved these bonuses to rigs.
---
That said, I see no reason CCP couldn't add the small rigs in for these.
---
No shit!

Since you know you are going up against Guiristas learn the resist profile and tank your ship accordingly. Make sure you have a primary high Kinetic Resist with your secondary being thermal. Should help you stay in the fight a bit longer.  And look at boasting the basic skills for Drones up to 4/5 asap  
---
Guristas is mainly weak to Kinetic and Thermal, as seen in the Damage Types chart on EVEuni. The Wasps are a good idea.

I mean I can keep sitting here and arguing with you about who is winning the meme war, but the fact is that it doesn't matter. Goons have always argued that bad things that happen to them are good things and that we're all as obsessed with you as you are with yourselves. Olmeca &amp; gang are killing goons because that's where the people are. If the people were in Darkness, they'd be there. Goons have the highest target density in the game - that's it. You're not special, you're just plentiful, and many of you are careless. Olmeca's not posting on reddit about killing stuff in Delve because grr gons; it would be grr dino or grr guardians just as much. It's not about you. It's not some vendetta. It's a symptom of a dying game that only one group provides any sort of meaningful content of this type, not because they are vulnerable, but because they're now so big and so dense that they can be hunted. A few years ago, there would be regular posts on reddit about all sorts of groups hunting all sorts of targets. Now, there's only one real target anymore. 
---
Assuming you are looking for a real answer;
---
1. People that watch the streamer regardless of what they are doing
---
2. People that want to ask questions about super ratting (how to do it, how to improve ticks, how to keep safe)
---
3. People that want to kill them.

I bet you can eat entire tide pods without swallowing and build the coolest houses in fortnite.

wrong ... it is "The Russian" ... there is only one, his name is Ivan he wears Ushanka squatting in front of KGB-HQ

Olmeca is what Gevlon Goblin would have been if he was good at the game.
---
as a fellow badposter...
---
Go to WHs
---
Nah its more simple than that, ccp doesnt actually play the game , they dont have a fucking clue in how to ballance it, which is why the rorq was allowed to last as long as it has as a miner despite ruining the mining economy, creating a massive surplus of isk ore and t1 hulls.
---
Isn't that considered an exploit?
---
I bet for Russian Coalition, or Those Russians

Multifit is god, all hail multifit and its brethren Buy All. Used to have a giant dump of 1.5B of modules at my staging, now I pyfa fits and get my hauler alt to move them from jita with 0 ISKs stuck in modules I might never use. I do keep a stockpile of ammo, drones, paste and sundry charges/script however and and the loot looker is still there for rapid fit adjustments.

Then you are stuck in your ways bro, you spending ten minutes getting stressed with the launcher is nothing to do with the launcher - you want to be pissed at the new launcher, plain and simple!! If it takes you that long to press a few 'play' buttons, or group launch, yet you still log in and use the games UI - well, I smell inconsistent BS somewhere along the line!!
---
My take: I use the new launcher, its quicker, groups is quicker, click 'launch group', pick group, done...its not harder, its not in anyway different, its exactly the same launcher, EXACTLY!! Does exactly the same job - it launches Eve. Its changed so many times over the years too, how can you give one jot of a fuck? It makes the game work, who gives a shit? 
---
The devil is in the detail Globby. 
---
I do like that it shows you the number of unique pilots vs number of ships, so you can tell how many people reshipped to get back in the fight, but other then that the rest of this site is kinda garbage.

please don't mix me ingame and "me" here

I have my mumble open all the time even when I'm not playing Eve.

Usually just a bunch of laughter

Intention was to say that I would rather donate for the civilian victims than for the soldier ... as i am a pacifistic sissy

We're you playing during the days of expensive ancillary armor reps? They uses to cost as much as the rest of a t1 frigate fit, but are very cheap now. Besides that you cant really get that expensive without t2 rigs and faction mods. T2 fitting is too tight to get a whole fit of it, and metas are all way cheaper except like IFFA DC and regoliths, etc.

They fired their PR team, the rest are antisocial programmers locked in their dark cubicles with Doritos and mountain dew.

I figured since I'm so new to fittings and I HATE running logistics myself, I'd just get 330km3 of every module and rig and ammo possible, and the rest hulls, and it JFed in. Lol. This way I'm not needing to do more trips or hiring more freight services when I realize a new hull I want to fly needs a different meta of a module or I want to do something off the wall that needs odd rigs, etc.

I'm slowly settling into fits worth saving and restocking for in the future though, or staging into call/gal space too :)

Wait, don’t you use deployable bubbles in your “pleb” traps? In fact, didn’t you just do a resdit warrior post about a super kill you got using a deployable vubble where the rats did the majority of the damage?

So... if goons use an anchor bubble against you that results in you losing ships involving NPCs its a broken nullbear mechanic, but when you do it, well thats braggable elite pvp skill.

Why is the fight @ a XIX Keepstar?
---
can we have some aar?
---
I thought russians are the attackers. Did they defend a structure in their staging system?
---
Every time I join these fleets we just spend an hour failing at wormholes then get hazed by titans.  I think I'm bad luck.
---
bubbling a station undock camped with diamond rats and bubbling an anom are two equally balanced things to you? cleary just another guy that doesn't have the faintest clue whats what
---
...The entire thread is about padding stats on zkillboard.  Isn't everyone involved already there?
---
I think they gave 500k to one of my alt with 1mil sp on my main account.....wtf CCP
---
Wonder if he will get his own commodity item. Ooooo I got it "marshys modified monitor setup"
---
I've tried my hand at a couple fed Navy comets just because... Haha. I thought the first fight went really well with me in a 2-neut, 1-blaster tristan. I did lose, but thoughy that with drugs and fixing a mistake I made might pulled it off... then I put this guys fit into pyfa and saw that 3/4 structure was still more ehp than I had total. Lol.
---
Tried another comet with a dual web merlin just for kicks today but yeah, had it bleeding structure but it had nanite left when I died.
---
I never really realized how significant the difference between t1-&gt;faction frigs was. I always thought pirate frigs were much stronger but faction weren't quite so nasty compared to t1.
---
Roasted.
---
It takes practice to notice and keep track of enemy ewar effect.
---
As for implants, a lot of the really good soloers in the wz run them. If you wonder how that jag is doing 5k per second cold... That's high-grade snakes. If a target is seemingly repping their whole armor every cycle? Asklepians. Same with shield? Crystals.
---
It's a cost/benefit thing but in lowsec you don't lose pods all the time.
---
Drugs are fairly popular as well but you're less likely to see them in plain/cheap T1 fit but if a solo bigger ship is taking on a gang, it's not unexpected for them to run an exile or a drop or whatever booster. You generally won't find much of that in 1 on 1.
---
They don't care, already paid for by the FRT TREASURY bots

This guy keeps inviting me into his shed and trying to touch my winky, avoid this shed winky toucher
---
Yeah, because apparently what I had was an argument against bubbles and not how NPCs are being used as campers for whoever wanting to block a station.
---
delete whatever shitty BR thing you are using
---
Whats a good basic incursion ratting fleet setup look like
---
Hmm, send me a pm with details please.
---
A mail was sent out before the meet on August 29/08/2018 with the Drake SKIN code inside along with instructions for redeeming it. The Falcon SKIN was handed out on arrival at the meet to everyone who pre-purchased tickets in advance, and anyone who showed up before super late on the last day. I had spares and were literally throwing them at people by the end. If you showed up super duper late and didn't pre-purchase a ticket you would have never gotten any SKIN and there are none left now.
---
If you bought a ticket in advance on the website and did not receive the email in advance, please PM me and I will take a look at my records.
---
The guy above calling me a scammer is lying through his teeth considering I *do* run events and lots of people do come and get prizes (75 at the last one). I've spent years organising these meets, and now have started to run in game events too.
---
Constructive criticism is very much welcomed as it helps me improve. Blatantly lying and spreading baseless rumours is quite hurtful to the reputation of the meets, and also to me personally as I put a lot of effort in and really don't appreciate being attacked for no reason.
---
Not as far as I know, I'm just using all the avaiable game mechanics the client provides.
---
Oh geez, a tristan should be really cheap. My low skill alt often flies T1 fit ones that are under 1m isk and while it's mostly used for plexing, I take some of the T1 frigs that jump on it and I'm 50% for it.
---
My main sometimes flies full T2 fit tristans and that's usually around 8-9m ISK. For 20m you're blinging it or something (I do see some alpha pilots out there fly faction drones however, that adds up quick.)
---
Can panfarm hurry up and widot these dudes so we don’t have to hear them Tri to spin the narrative that they are fighting everyone in eve on their own for the rest of 2019.

True, every group has that one guy that won't shut up about being in the Army.  And somehow manages to turn every conversation into about how he was in the military.  I ama vet myself but I haven't mentioned it in years and not unless asked.

I'm a vet btw.
---
Lets talk about how you accidentally dropped on a Hel you thought was hyper fit two nights ago in delve, but it turns out you aren’t even that good at identifying pretty obvious shit and lost 7 dreads and a pod one blingy pod instead. 
---
Let’s talk about how fail fit those dreads were too, they were as mockably fit as this poor dude you are harrassing while complaining about how you are harassed.

Where is that post?

You have something wrong with your logic.
---
Not all vexors and ishtars in PB are bots.
---
Not every time character can be under bot application
---
But this particular char is bot. And you perfectly know who is owner of this. As well as this char is reported to CCP. (Everybody knows that CCP doesn't care)
---
to borrow your own phrase, caring about fake internet points and bad forums purity is a big ol' yikes
---
I have to admit, that im quite surprised to see XIX and Red allied. 
---
They have been bitter rivals for a long time and have fought more than one war (the latest was the eviction of Red from Insmother). 
---
It seems a common enemy was enough to band them together... for now!
---
And here I was all up on my high horse defending my honour!!
---
Because skill injectors and heroin both stop working as well after a while?
---
1. No
---
2. Risk vs. reward
---
Are there any particular options you'd recommend for something like this?  I like to listen to music/etc while on comms/in fleet, and it messes with the audio in my footage sometimes.
---
If it's bad, surely it's better its removed?
---
Rorqs would have been fine if injectors didn’t exist.
---
Thanks btw
---
So Weekend Warriors a TRI pet now? Little birdies told us you will help each other against PB Coalition... Wolfie is finally, finally, a sov holder. Congratulations, you can have until TRItards are no more around. 
---
Because isk has no value anymore. There are massive near risk free isk faucets in Eve. Literally everything is affordable pretty easy now. Look at how cheap Titans are now.
---
Quoting Yonis ruins your credibility 
---
Its basically the same story told once again except you ignored basically every one that came and got scammed before you.  It is a hilarious story tbh.
---
Yeah let's unpack that a little bit.
---
- TIL when we go for tanky people it's an accident. But when we go for hyperspatials its on purpose.
---
- Even if we only went for untanked fits, apparently carefully choosing your targets is a crime and show you are a shit Eve player.
---
- You saw my main's fit and (probably except your slightly smarter content creators) couldn't even comprehend what the fit was designed for. So you proceeded to mock it due to your lack of brains lol.
---
Everytime you post it's more oblivious than the previous one. Never seen a Goon spinster do his reddit job in such a self defeating way lol.
---
But they still cost more than injecting even with the worst sp-payout
---
That would actually be great.
---
I know you nerds arent behind on info, but CFC died long ago fam.
---
Lol Init hasn't even done anything yet and people are already cranking out salty pet memes.
---
The war truly is won on reddit
---
^This,  All the rules of supercaps in GSF that you basically ignored got you cucked.
---
Everybody can check that you are liar.
---
TRI move ops was 22 dec and it's easy to find at titan losses
---
Spy in Olds talking about '+' is a joke
---
Regularly asking Chineese means 2 times
---
Meanwhile,

1) Snuff titan that bosoned our machs in OLDs as well as 80 caps on standby
---
2) Snuff that killed our forti on arrival
---
3) Init full fleet that killed our forti 2 days ago
---
4) Snuff capitals that droped on us when we fighting their Nightmares
---
5) INIT capitals and machs that was droped by NC.
---
It is what i can remember right now. So you guys should close your mouth and just look at yourself mr. "You don’t deserve to hold any SOV"
---
LPT: Don't ask me how the fuck fuel works.

sorry because i have auto-reject on each char because you guys spam me with fleet invites and chats as lepra
---
sorry because you are mad and mentioning mine rl every day in local and now in reddit posts * like you have work and family i dont * 
---
sorry because you are incompetent so want ccp to do your job

sorry because as long im active in eve your chance to do something in PB are equal to 0

sorry
---
Herding double digit IQ F1 trash effectively is definitely a skill, ask any of our FCs.
---
I think it's also kinda messed up, that they're only giving it to people subbed on that specific day. When it's been an ongoing problem for the entire time. I apparently wasn't subbed that day (took a short break for a couple of months) and so I don't get any, even though I was subbed most of the year and dealth with the chat breaking constantly...
---
Everyone says this, but no one ever takes the bait :'(
---
I respect a man smart enough to recognize what he doesn't know.
---
Because a few assholes are the ones making them cost much more than they are worth
---
My claims are false? even though the evidence suggests otherwise, Refer to my post below. 
---
You outformed 101 pilots on us on  for your fort defense timer the other day and still had to call INIT and SkillU, You must be afraid of 60 Tri pilots. 
---
1. You reference our crabbing alts in an attempt to inflate the size of our actual fighting Force. 
---
2. Yes? who cares about what happened before this conflict. It just adds to heros post anyway that mid sized conflicts are alive and well in Pure Blind.
---
3. We had corps leave us and you still need to batphone Imperium to defend your shit. This makes you the kind of Tenant that pays rent with their mouth. 
---
4. "SPY posing as friends" You knew who arrow was and he flew with you alot but you have a liking for BBC and arrows not a cuck.
---
5. You lost "2 on 1 before French arrive and now you lose 3 on 2 so nothing changed here. 
---
6. TLDR "YOU CANT BLOB AND CALL BATPHONES ONLY WE CAN"
---
7. Raging tempest cant fly carriers but his RMT pool lets him at least attempt to. Keep up the feed. 
---
8. "You dont deserve any sov" From the mouth of a timezone tanking batphoning subpar alliance. Seems tainted with Irony.

" To kill the pleb, we need afk campers, pushing hardware boundaries by coming up with best computational solutions to run so many accounts. "

---
OBJECTION 
---
It is a variation of the idea that doctors make bad airplane pilots.  
---
They have money.  They buy complex high performance planes, but they don’t have time to learn how to fly them.  They also sometimes think they know more than they do.  
---
Sadly (or happily) Delve is full of very rich people who never spent the time to learn to fly the toys they got...many who think they know more than they do. 
---
Those that want to learn, have more then enough resources in the Imperium to learn.  
---
Those that don’t will be mocked and used as examples for the rest.

It’s the ‘Goon way’ of doing things and it actually works.

That was my logic. What I found is I was doing 1-2 trip to jita per week because I was always out a given rig or module. So now I just use my dst alt to move in fully complete multibuy fits.

Has some good stuff on ganking/bumping. The standard is to use either a catalyst, vexor or thrasher. The catalyst can either do small targets solo, or big stuff in groups, and the vexor is good for medium sized things.

i guess i should redefine friend to "person you trust enough to fuel the base or open a cyno"
---
If yonis said that it must be true
---
Definitely align yourself with the New Order of Highsec a.k.a. CODE. Little bit worried that you need help figuring out how to fit a destroyer for max DPS though; gankers need a degree of self motivation to be any good.

Snuff, Snuff, man you have phobia of Snuff... Perhaps you if you keep creating content for them one or few more times they will let you in one of their corps...
---
Your 4th of 5th unsuccessful Forti deployment so far... Yes INIT was there together with us on the kill. Don't you think little birdies didn't told us who was supposed to help you, and they were prevented due to some fight in low sec?
---
This whole OP is bs. You are not big player anymore (if you were ever one anyhow), you are just a dying alliance trying to justify your defeat(s) on some bigger players before the end.  
---
Do you write botting scripts that gatecamp for you too?
---
So this turns out to be bullying u fucks? At least show some respect and dont show the mans face while throwing with shit on the internet. We play eve because it has the greatest community. You seem to have understood something completely wrong when you created your accounts.

People lose supers everyday and theres supers even  worse fitted than his one. 
---
For the next time: upload the video of him getting killed, underline it with your shitty music, make fun of it and thats it. Amen.

It's fascinating to me we hold dramatic videos such as this with such high regard, imagining what massive fights could be like in the EVE universe.

Why not instead of bringing barges up, why don't we bring rorqual's down, but in a less direct way? Moon mining is a thing now, so why doesn't ccp start phasing out ore anom's and make null miners more reliant on actual infrastructure for around-the-clock mining?

And no shits were given.....

No we moved our supers 22nd of december you mouth breathing mOnGoLoid, We didnt get here till much later. 
---
We dont claim to be a big player anymore but we do love watching the salt your alliance has because of your Innate inability to actual fight a battle on your own, but yet all you do is sit there and claim victories from things other alliances do to us. 
---
That is pathetic.
---
hes streaming it on twitch for everyone to see? rofl. 
---
&gt; when we go for tanky people it's an accident. But when we go for hyperspatials its on purpose.
---
That's right, because hyperspatials aren't tanked, or rather you can ensure by identifying a hyperspatial fit super capital that the ship has significantly fewer EHP than one without hyperspatials. You see they're sacrificing tank to go faster in warp, and to increase those dank ticks. Just like this dude whose kill mail you've linked up here. 
---
I swear, some of you know must know how some of the game mechanics work, otherwise you wouldn't be picking on hyperspatials; however, as noted by Mar5y's amazement at the existence of, the use of, diamond rats,  the fits on those Dreads you lost two days ago--which, in case anyone is interested, they were, no exaggeration as poorly fit as this guys Nyx was--and you thinking there is some contradiction in the statement "you pick on hyperspatials and only drop properly tanked supers on accident" I think you might actually be terrible at this game. 
---
I mean, I have been back *maybe* three months after a 6 year eve vacation, and I feel like I know game mechanics better than at least you do (if there are really more than one of you). 
---
But hey, because, unlike you, I am not *actually a reddit warrior*, so I do not post giant QQ + bragging posts about fights or kills no matter how funny, sad, or even good I think my opponent in the pixel spaceship game was.  
---
Lastly, and here is a shot not aimed at you, but really the entire r/eve community, calling player interactions 'content' and players 'content creators' is ridiculous. Doing so is 3 parts arrogance, 2 parts pretentious bullshit, and 5 parts just annoying. 
---
He’s not banned currently. He was banned twice previously. 
---
Muhamed Jihad/Flores spoke about it at length on ts multiple times and is also the person who told us all cable was banned for selling isk to noraus. 
---
Many people that stayed in alliance corroborated the story. I understand if you have some personal investment in him but nigh everyone previously in his corp has a chori rmt story and people currently in his Corp have said as much.
---
If your only reason to not believe that is that chori said so then of course he wouldn’t tell you he sold isk

Teasingly, new-AI Drifters are being tested against player structures - keep an eye out on that, it could get really interesting~
---
I'm sorry, but your comment makes no sense. The fact that Titans are cheap means that ISK is expensive. It would be otherwise if your statement was true. Truth is that there are much more players who do not 'exploit' those risk free faucets, while the player who do, make sure that 'ISK market' is not over-supplied.
---
I dont fuckin care if hes streaming it or not. Let him do it. Of course he learned his lessons even if it was the hardest way. And he was strong enough to stay on stream while being blapped in his super. He's tough. But making a post starting with the sentence "Meet Pleb" and going on with calling him pleb all the way is so fuckin wrong and i hope you fuckin know that. This became personal so quick and its the wrongest thing you can ever do.   
---
Make boosts not give a weapon timer or require siege to be genuinely effective and maybe you’ll have an argument there.
---
So you are confirming Weekends are now working with TRItards. You did form up for their Astrahaus rescue (final anchoring timer) the other day. Lee never offer them anything, don't make up additional lies pls.

---
Next time those Supers of yours are killing off-lined POS structures please don't run away when a single hostile ceptor appears in local. Btw, OP post just confirms you are very frustrated the way things are going for your aggressive PVP aliance. Please don't forget this is a computer game only. Like your "god among the man" hero FC Arrow once said, sometimes you win and sometimes you loose. Chill a bit now.
---
Comparing the MER to Oldmeca's pleb kills tells me that the plebs are winning, by a large margin
---
With all due respect, he is getting bullied by his alliancemates and not me. I already said I respect the playstyle but Eve nullsec can't be that secure for people did not learn the skills to survive in there. "Pleb" is just a name I use for people whose nullsec activities solely depend on safety provided by others. Moreover, he is streaming his activity and showing his face himself. I just made an edit so people don't have to sift through a 7 hours video to understand what's going on.
---
We don't have to stop pointing out how people not that good with the game get to farm billions in top ships, just because the guy is a nice streamer or a combat vet. It's a game issue. I am not the one making it about IRL stuff.
---
Exactly right. The existence of the NPCs are a function of the game mechanics involved with faction standing with NPC corps and NPC stations. The bubbles are a mechanic that works only in null sec that prevents warping. 
---
In the first case, NPC stations are bubbled while you, and anyone with poor standing, come too close to the station and cause rats to spawn. The bubbles then keep you from warping, and the NPCs who do not like you are hostile to you and therefore shoot you. Player group one--say goons--are using the two mechanics in concert such that you cannot warp, and the rats apply their DPS to you, which kills you. 
---
Whereas in your case you use the bubbles in anomalies containing rats hostile to your target. The bubbles prevent your target from warping, and the rats apply their DPS to the target... and fair enough so do you... such that they help you, and at least in the case with your giant reddit warrior post, do the *majority* of the damage. 
---
I would buy a lack of contradiction in your statements if you were say, advocating that rats not shoot at anyone bubbled, but you aren't. You are specifically complaining about how when the other guy does it you at a station, this is somehow a 'broken' mechanic, but when you do it in an anomaly having the rats help you kill players is completely legitimate and well thought out use of game mechanics.  
---
&gt; Complain about 'harassment' by 'reddit warriors';
---
&gt;When what the actual fuck do you think you are doing right now; oh that's right
---
&gt;Harassing some PTSD looking former soldier who streams with a reddit warrior post.

want to talk about it ? Or you will, as always dodge the thing that doesn't make you looks like perfect Mr.Olmeca_ego

---
Of course you wouldnt know what lee did youre just a mission pulling spodbrain. 
---
he did link me a screenshot of them but they were trash so I wasn't going to quibble lol.
---
Yes, absolutely. And a at least mechanics exists for you to circumvent this tactic if it bothers you so much. Put up your own upwell structures or stop staging out of hostile NPC stations. Seems pretty simple to me. 
---
Of course, now you will say "I can't put my own upwells because goons will just take them down." And in so doing be complaining that the notion of social interaction and human beings acting in concert is unbalanced because one group is bigger than another. 
---
Fun fact about that, it is 'unbalanced.' But this is by design as far as the game goes, which is a design principle based firmly on reality. 
---
It would have been another 20-40m ish total :P

---
Multiple factors go in why we attack someone in particular. But let's suppose the only factor is hyperspatials. What's your point?
---
&gt; the fits on those Dreads you lost two days ago

Show me one badly fit dread.
---
&gt; I am not actually a reddit warrior
---
But you are at war spin a narrative that's not even well-angled. Most reddit warriors wouldn't even think they are reddit warriors. As I said before, their reasoning capabilities are clouded with the zealous drive to defend your space cult at all costs. You are a generic mega alliance reddit warrior.
---
And your badly constructed angle is that we are not good Eve players. We didn't even claim we were good. I just said we put in a lot of work and it is hard to kill plebs. And I said plebs are bad players. I don't need the claim that I am good to make my point in this thread, nor I have anything to prove to you. Besides, I've been told by many Goons that I'm good at what I do (just [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/asyz7o/pleb_the_unsung_hero_of_delve_mer_ticks_dies_on/egynh0o) example in this thread). For some Goons, that's the only praise they give to me in-between all the shit and hate.
---
Nice 
---
 "Next time those Supers of yours are killing off-lined POS structures please don't run away when a single hostile ceptor appears in local. " Being careful with our supers is meant to insult us? 
---
 "Btw, OP post just confirms you are very frustrated the way things are going for your aggressive PVP aliance. " 
---
Are you actually Joking? let me reference the original post. 
---
 "It is the most fun I have had in eve in a while and I can speak for many in my corporation who feel the same way. I am sure that most players in the opponent groups are also enjoying the conflict." 
---
Frustration, sure..
---
The only aggressive thing I see from Oldschool is how aggressive lee is with his mouth around BBC.

Nah its just a very vocal minority. Trust me, they are annoying and hated IRL too.

Do u guys have the March meeting planned? I'll miss this one but it would be nice to know a while ahead of time so I can make sure i'm free.

I made over 2b between February 1st and 14th just running combat Anoms/Sigs in Gallente HS for 4-6hrs/day. 400m/wk seems sorta low...
---
That's.... not where any of the actual isk-making bots are. Kill what, one VNI that wasn't going to be able to undock anyway because there's *always* neuts in PH staging?
---
Try again
---
Hype
---
Test alliance best alliance 
---
Most of the pvpers left now they just krab out of the Mordus npc station.
---
Yep, I'd be farming combat anoms/sigs right now if my computer hadn't had to go in for warranty work... I made a bit over 2b in the first 2 weeks of the month running those in Gallente HS for 4-6hr/day with a VNI.
---
This is premium quality posting from all sides.
---
But the stats and battle reports make it clear to me that the banter of Tri being a dead alliance is hardly to be believed. Tri seem to be fighting very successfully, outnumbered as well, while being under the pressure of major powers like snuff init and goons all just a batphone away. Seems they and can't get a fortizar down to save their lives either without 1000 people decending upon it. 
---
At the same time olds has been able to beat them in the sov fight. I'd like to fly up to pb and verify that the coward timezone timer tank is real or not. That would explain what seems very odd to me at this point that tri is struggling with taking sov.
---
Again, the battle reports linked and alliance stats show me clearly they are basically bludgeoning what looks to be a coalition of 3-4 alliances that equal 2000+ more members than tri has anytime help doesn't come from snuff init or goons
---
Good day all

No, it means that the supplies are well stocked all around. Plenty of money free to spend on the extras when you are in these safe areas, so the extras jump in price.

Theres a few groups out there that do incursion fleets that anyone can do.

Take a look at [The Ditanian Fleet](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/the-ditanian-fleet-incursion-community/114885) theyre a group that uses armour ships.

You may have to get in line behind the other big blocks that frequently want to crash the party. If large blocks show up no significant fights happen. If they don't show up the fun continues.

They going to change their minds about moving and instead self destruct?

Stop bashing this guy retards. The guy is shit there is no doubt. But its not hia fault the game has become a clown fiesta regarding mechanics. Hate ccp not plebs

Listen, no serious alliance would abandon 2 regions, dozens of highly expensive structures after being attacked for only a month. Lee was moderate when he said 2 Trillions, it is probably even more. What happened in the mean time? You started moving up north on the premise you would evict PB locals based on the intel gathered by your spy, you've lost your Titan fleet and keep getting your TRItard nose bloodied ever since. You can fool anyone here.

Oh, uh, south doesn't count in TRItards memory anymore? You didn't want/need that space anyhow? Oh Garst wasn't active, there was no leadership? You are far away from serious PvP alliance. Do us a favor and stop posting crap. 
---
They're cheaper because of oversupply of minerals meaning it's cheaper to build them, not because of isk faucets. If anything, too many isk faucets would cause inflation which should cause prices to rise

You cant and neither did I. The only way you can attempt to overheat fighter weapons is through keyboard shortcuts as the modules themselves don't have overheat buttons.

TEST is recruiting
---
If you have proof, post it and get him banned otherwise this smacktalk reeks of Lotka Volterra vs Red Alliance
---
Okay okay, people do sperg about phone but saying we phone rote and proximity (TNT) is like saying you phone Void and gentry. It's just dumb. We're bestest buds that have literally all flown together for like 3 years? You cant say that you haven't phoned outside entities more often than not, so let's be real. We came at it for good fights and if you dont want that then you do you. Call Snuff, iron, reddit, whoever really. Idc, it's a game and we're going to play it
---
The transparency thing is a valid issue. At least to a degree which some people will claim is small, others will claim is large.
---
But again, I very much doubt they will take any direct action against anyone where they don't have evidence. And evidence will not exist against anyone that truly didn't know. 
---
The assets, ISK, Plex will be removed along with an explanation why it was removed. Rest of it will remain as is and they will stay quiet about it beyond the general report of "we removed X number of so and so assets from alliances in the past month". The only way anyone will find out, is when you inform them yourself.
---
Where I see this hurting you, allaince leaderships etc. Is that if they knew better who not to recruit, then they could have recruited / rented to legit players and end up with more assets / ISK / Plex instead of less.
---
Last but not least, the system is evolving and has to grow into what it needs to grow into. It is not in its final form, so you very well may end up getting transparency. Or may not. No one really knows at this point.

He admitted in his own post that that was bullshit.
---
The theoretical value of an accelerator is where the ISK/SP matches an injector - and remember that (i) accelerators work for 48h and (ii) injectors don't give the full 500k. You did account for the second for characters up to 80m SP - above that an injector halves in efficiency again.
---
Normally accelerators end up being cheaper than that, because they are time limited and easy to acquire, so more are produced than can actually be used. But with this event being so not worth doing, that isn't the case this time.
---
also thanks for the updates on AT, and your optimism on it's future. For a pilot who has ridden the pine for the last 2 AT's I am pretty stoked for AT 2020. 
---
If you’re going to do exploration and you’re hacking sites you have to target the cans. Multiple warp core stabilizers can make that a painful experience.
---
This has nothing to do with time or kids or anything like that guys, my kids are grown and gone, and I do have appropriate time. I do not expect you to understand but will try to give you a pointer nonetheless.

I'm too old and too set in my ways. When you hit a certain age, your ability to "unset" disappears for a wide combination of reasons. It is gone and it is not a choice, it just happens naturally, and that is all there is to it.

I do not expect any of you to understand or approve, but beware, this is coming for all of you too, and then you will understand and perhaps some of you will even think about this post as you look back on it.

That you can still make it in eve, basically just disputing the previous guys claim

Eve's had problems with supers for literal years, just in different forms. It's a bit oversaturated at the moment with capitals if you want to seriously contest for space, but I'd say you're only limited by what you limit yourself to.

I understand fully that it's not ideal, but it's just something that needs to happen for now for a myriad of reasons.

You won’t make as much isk from LP, but it’s fun being the underdog. And there’s a ton of good fights to be had in both warzones, solo, small gang especially.

Signature affects how long it takes for someone else to target/how much they damage you. High sig = bad.

Also learn to maths, if the IIs are cheaper or give you the right amount of pg/cpu then make the decision based on the numbers. At the end of the day you shouldn't have to ask reddit if you learn this basic skill.

You posted the thread, linked to his stream, and wrote a fucking doctoral thesis about what a "pleb" he is and you think if what's happening here is bullying then your hands are clean?
---
I know you're a subfunctional autist but you might need to pull your head out of your ass a bit.
---
By posting a thread to with the sole purpose being to abuse the guy, you are not only involved in the bullying but directly responsible for it.

If you are not comfortable with that then maybe you should calm the fuck down about this video game.

---
He said 'casually' so that's not bad.
---
True.
---
The LP is lower (until the farmers switch over again) but because, at least for Amarr, it's been that way around for a while, the LP is worth more. Not enough more to even it out, but enough to still make it worthwhile. You should be able to earn the ISK to buy PVP ships no problem.

---
Dear god please no...
---
In wormholes people can’t see your name until after they’re on grid with you. So I doubt zkill is having an effect there. 
---
And in null people would almost certainly be more likely to engage if they saw a bunch of solo kills/losses, as opposed to gangs
---
&gt; I know you're a subfunctional autis
---
&gt; you are not only involved in the bullying but directly responsible for it.
---
Are you like, on purpose being ironic here?

PS: We can't just stop posting anything about bad Eve players being bad, due to the worry that these players might get cyberbullied by their alliancemates. He was totally fine with losing his ship until Goons flocked on his stream and began shitting on him.

Also I can probably still vouch you into PL with corp recruiting standards as low as this, whoever you may be. No charge for PL vouches.
---
I've been reading a lot about VNI ratting and if these can be done the same, a common theme I notice is having a 100mn afterburner and orbit @50km to keep from getting hit. Drones should still be fine. Maybe throw a drone range module in the high slot. If I'm totally off, I apologise. Good luck!

" And to be honest, just shooting whatever comes your way if you have even the slightest chance of killing it is way more fun than being a risk averse fuck that only chooses fights you think you can win. " this has been close to my mindset, i don't find it fun fighting things my size, my idea of a good fight in eve is flying something stupid that the odds aren't in my favor for winning. It just makes the fight that much more exciting when i do win.  
---
" I think you are completely overestimating the impact zkill has on the engagements people take " I think i may have a slightly twisted view on it due to some of the people i talk too, I've heard a person in a t3 cruiser that's entire fitting was around alpha'in frigs out of de-cloak and not letting them have a chance to react. These kinds of people i've heard call for back up or flat out refuse to engage things like an astero on the off chance it's bait.I've actually heard them in comms say they're leaving a t1 explorer becuase they had a kill in one on zkill and didn't want to risk it because he didn't have med nuets fitted that time, he was in a legion.  
---
 Never mind if a close fight actually shows, they'll be out of system before the persons de-cloak timer from entering has fallen off.  
---
a question i ask a lot
---
lol I got 250k SP on a character that I do not use
---
Cheers CCP, managed to fuck something up worse than the chat system
---
Glad someone agrees with my view on it 
---
If ESI is fucky, Pathfinder is fucky. Blame CCP
---
the problem is, i'd have to do this after every kill i get, or atleast every 10. Or i'd keep running into the same issue or someone going on zkill seeing i'm not fit how that ship is meant to be fit and thus raises suspicion.

Good to see ya again James.

For sure. I was a bit tilted for a day or two, but your interview on TIS along with Elise's poast on this sub helped the quell the rage.
---
Although, I was wondering if the rumblings of CCP supporting player ran Tournament is true or not. After " The Pit " was cancelled forever (F ymenoa) I started a document that hopefully can turn into a rule set of sorts for my own player ran tourney. Who could I chat about that to make it to fruition, or possibly get pointed in the right direction to get the ball rolling at least. If not true, then I will go cry about it...

Highsec incursion
---
yeah it's a real dumb turn of phrase, but when you're trying to explain something complicated to someone who, well, isn't, it helps to put things in their own language
---
i wish the option to have my toon removed from zkill was an option too.  
---
I'd like a new bar that rates how close zkill would think the fight was and fill either a badass or a carebear bar. Like if you only fight ships smaller than yours that didn't stand a chance the higher your care-bear bar would fill.  
---
Where-as someone who fights only there own sized ships or larger should have a badass bar at max.  
---
Personally i'd still love to see the removal of zkill but people will put ego before they're fun and will likely just complain about it till it's back.  
---
I was checking someone's zkill who didn't want to fight my t1 battle explorer fit ship. They were in a full nuet astero likely camping explorers. 3 years of gameplay, a 99% killboard dangerous, i couldn't find one kill that wasn't a t1 explorer.   
---
Even though he was fit to fight explorers and would of easily wiped the floor with my fitting(nuets were a hard af counter to my ship) he wouldn't engage.   
---
They have a bar for blops and solo, so why not what for your engagement profile. I'm sure it would incentivise people playing so risk aversly to stop because there because zkill is calling them out on it.

highsec mining is 10 mill an hour, so 8 hours of that should do it. 
---
or you can do low sec or nullsec mining if you can tank rats and make 30m an hour...
---
or do market trading, shouldnt be too hard to make 80 mill a day, but you need isk upfront to do this for manipulation or lots of buy orders.

Looking at Pyfa now, with 5 heavy neutrons (not electrons), 2 mag stabs and a T2 falloff rig (hybrid ambit extension), with Null loaded you're doing a respectable 522 damage (without drones) with a a 6.3 optimal and a 15.8 KM falloff.  Coupled with the web, relatively high base speed and agility, that thing has a ton of range control.
---
Ye. Thousand real people vs five guys and their alts. 
---
yeah long time no see
---
Applied to TEST again, but got denied for whatever reason, so I thought it was about time to see how solo/NPSI looks these days.
---
This made my day.  Thanks for the laugh!
---
It's kind of a grind tbh, because basically you're structure grinding but you also really have to pay attention
---
Because this event was shit, so nobody did it making the accelerator supply dismal. 
---
Ok, this is a good one

Did you take more than five seconds to read the thread replies in which this claim was debunked?

EA is part of the problem with the state of gaming today.  Games need to be more about player interaction like SWG back in the day or ultima online or DAOC instead about the micro transaction.  Games like these take time and resources to develop not sumthing you can turn a quick buck on.

Your much more likely to run into  cloaky camper in wormhole space, just because they have to get on grid with you doesn't mean they have to instantly decloak and attack you once they do. I don't think i know a single person who hunts in wormholes who doesn't check zkill to get an idea of what they're about to fight.   
---
The problem i'm having might be exaggerated with the people i've flown with though, i've heard people in t3's not engage frigates or higher that have a record of having a pvp fitting because they're scared it's going to be bait. There is nothing in eve more embarrassing then hearing your mate ask for help killing a frigate then telling you there in a t3 cruiser designed for killing frigs.  I might need to distance myself from these carebears and get an unbiased view.
---
The problem isn't as bad in null, but getting blopsed is alot more of an issue though, not that i mind, i find it fun trying to escape a decent blops.  
---
I might try faction warfare out, always presumed it wouldn't be for me and never looked into it but it doesn't seem that bad now i'm looking over it again.  
---
indeed
---
What I call, "haul trading".
---
Buy low.  Haul.  Sell higher.
---
I could easily earn 200m per trip.  I was mostly limited by purchase funds, safe hauling practices, and hauling capacity.
---
Started with an Orca.  Ended with 5 Charons.
---
Thats a real dope gif though
---
I just started religiously station trading 2 days ago with about 1.3 bil ISK, I'm already up 400mil at 1.7bil, way better than the 300mil a month (or 2.1bil excluding PLEX) skillpoint farming I used to do, better than even exploration that I used to do so much at like 10-100mil an hour. Can't wait to try out hauling between the markets with a freighter like those, the ISK must be pretty big at that kind of scale.
---
Tip for anyone passing through here: liquid ISK is useless, put it in assets that'll get more expensive over time like PLEX, if you're just hoarding liquid ISK. Items change value, not ISK.
---
there is a reason why i mute alliance chat

That’s the opposite of what inflation does. The nominal value of things increase.
---
Story behind it, I haven't touched these sites?
---
Did you lose a super to PL in the past
---
PVE VNIs are almost entirely reliant on sig tanking for defense. Without the 100mn, you’ll definitely have issues. With it, the rest of your defense barely matters. 
---
sweet thx
---
#👌
---
a dread :D
---
Facts not in evidence.
---
Vip site, you kill a bunch of normal frigate and cruiser rats and then a carrier spawns as "boss" while small stuff is constantly re-spawning, loot is shit, there are 0 bounties and if you are doing it in a solo carrier the npc carrier can be quite the sponge  and will take forever to kill 
---
Supers used to be unable to dock, so trading them involved a lot of trust. You'd go into a POS shield, exit the Titan, allow a third party to enter the Titan and verify everything was as agreed, then the ISK handover happened.
---
Titan scams usually referred to the third party screwing over one or both of buyer or seller.
---
For anyone the edit is aimed at, if you're going out of your way to make a person the post is directed at have a bad time, wtf is wrong with you? Because he doesn't fly the way you like or isn't an knowledgeable about the game that gives you a right to makes his experience with the game lesser? Fair enough gank him in null or something, but if you're going to type him up a storm you need to remove yourself from eve and re-evaluate what kind of person you are. We're all here to have fun, not make someone elses experience hell.  
---
I figured with eve being more of an adult aimed games these childish issues wouldn't be an issue. but men-children exist i suppose. 
---
that escalated quickly
---
oh okay, pretty straight forward then , i like it 
---
Never seen this before. Love Carl Sagan. Thanks for sharing!

Didn't he get blacklisted from the whole Imperium?
---
Good man, but apparently even good men can deserve a ban.

I tought it was 100 000 000 == 1

Went to message a very old EVE friend (from back when you had to run freighters down a pipe with an escort fleet and no warp to 0) and found it in the message history.

Don't make me ban you from your own discord.

Oh deary me

The Initiative is currently deployed in a lowsec system, close to Jita and closer to NC. systems. Basically, I guess they want to harass them and make their life an hell, with the constant threat of being dropped on for NC. and PL, the two entities having rendered this official by declaring war to the Initiative.

What is the TLDR, state of TEST these days?    Been a year + since I’ve logged in. 
---
Too soon.
---
MOA  officially closed almost a year ago due primarily to Gen Eve not being in game (for about 6 months prior).  He was the heart and soul of MOA and without him we were just keeping time. There are still some “MOA” in name but it’s been closed.

Hello, I am here to find friends.  I have no idea what I'm doing.  Help.  c:

lol nice good job CCP, I'm pretty sure everyone who had a current loan with him are happy bee right now :D
---
Rvb (red versus blue)
---
Do you need a loan? 
---
Sadly, this event was an utter failure when they tried to pull a sneaky on us by announcing we could get faction, and even deadspace modules, but not telling they would be locked inside a proto lootbox system.
---
Really, I think it's a good thing that this event is simply not ran by players, judging by how many Guardian's Gala beacons you can think in almost every system.
---
CCP simply fucked up entirely this event, by giving it a slow respawn time that simply drove off interested players (and not locking at least one site per system that respawn as soon as the precedent one is completed). Plus, you basically need a minimum of 13 millions ISK, plus the special ore that is dumbly expensive to get something that 95% of the time will be ISK negative, since the loot table is fucked up.
---
That's like the first days of the Crimson Harvest event, but reversed : you do an extremely hard site for almost nothing. Really, they should go back to the model of the Drone Swarm Alert of 2017, which was way better, or improve the one of 2018, that had interesting stuff, and forced players to try new things outside of their daily scope, like hacking.
---
100% of the hype in this video is generated by the song, none of the credit should go to OP because they just sloppily stitched EVE clips onto a song with 0 effort at all
---
Such a waste of a good song because none of the footage goes well with the pacing of the music
---
Step it up, try being a fleet commander, small gang, strategic fleets, join/make a corp and blow up some expensive shit
---
FC is a decent idea though imo, corps need em

The t3cs wouldn’t be scared of a typical combat fit or solo kills, unless you’re in something like a t2 cruiser or a ship bonuses for neuts. They would be scared of a brick tank fit with scram + web and a history of flying with a gang.

I'm a bit afraid to try it myself, because I live in a wormhole, and failure mean getting locked out until I can scan down an highsec path (since it doesn't have an highsec static, only nullsec). Also, which class should I run ? Gamma can be great for the little bonus to shield HP, but this bonus is also applied to rats. Also, if I encounter one of those spawns with tons of neuting Leshaks, how do I survive with my tank failing because of the lack of energy ?

Thanks in advance !

I realized after our last exchange that his in game name was actually [Mani toranii](https://zkillboard.com/character/96891409/).  He was a good lad.  He will be missed.

Unbelievable, NC wouldn't undock their titans.

for a second there i thought this was about aryth

sad thing is i knew/know dudes that still do this :(

It's standard procedure when RMT is involved. RMT has a way of cascading out and catching up all sorts of people, depending on how promiscuous the person in question is, and more often than not, those people have supercaps. 
---
Op username checks out :) Source of the screenshot though?
---
That sucks
---
Respectfully fuck off.
---
Most likely because the person who uploaded it is a bottomfeeder who obtained a cropped image of a cropped image of a cropped image of the original screenshot.
---
I'm Nolak. I can confirm this. I took the picture with ShareX. The reason it looks shit is because it's 90% text size on a 1920x1080 potato graphics. 
---
Do you need a loan?
---
Everyone baited by thinking it would be Aryth, but its just fucking Nolak lmfao
---
Locator agents ftw

Pay your tithes to the trucking gods.

I mean, they lost 76bil last night. Does that count?
---
Zkill proves you wrong. Thanks for playing!

yeah true, I saw that loan Nolak had with a goon guy 65 bil with 1 titan as collateral... poor guy losing both because nolak was a piece of shit
---
I’ve mostly seen people use passive tank gilas with 4 Republic Fleet Shield Extenders, 1 hardener, and an AB in the mids. Put a nos in the utility high and you can keep the hardener on even while neuted , which should be enough to keep you alive. 
---
It’s not foolproof, but with good skills, and primarying webs and neuts, you can survive almost all spawns if you avoid sig bloom clouds and get under the guns on the drifter battleship, or simply keep transversal and kill off the webs/neuts fast enough. 
---
***Better call Saul...***
---
Correct, that's me. 
---
Pretty sure Aryth is the financial overlord of goonswarm.
---
He's in NPC corp now
---
Pretty cryptic graphic.  Can you translate what happened?
---
"Do you need an unban?"
---

---

lol aryth isn't stupid enough to get caught. gtfo here
---
All factions are good for a lot of things.
---
&gt; I've always liked the ship style and weapons (visually) of Amarr.
---
That is a big factor. Enjoy being in the Golden Fleet! :)
---
Basically, I should go from this active fit to something more passive, understood. In fact, I already know the passive fit using four shield expanders, that's what I used to run L2 comfortably before deciding to step up and get better rewards, however I didn't knew it was also viable for L3s.
---
I'll try that, thanks :)
---
However, with the four shield expanders version, is there some types of filaments I should avoid like the plague ? I hear Dark filaments are possibly the worst for Gilas.
---
Yeah rip my bus. Blessing in disguise maybe though if they don't hit my wallet. It was my cheap titan and buying a new one would end up being less than paying off the interest.  
---
I'm a returning player - been back for about 2 weeks. I last completed the soe epic arc in 2011 but the mission giver won't talk to me without a referral so i can ruin the arc again. Do i need to wait 3 months from my first login 2 weeks ago for it to reset?

So what are the chances of a leadership dude rmting his isk but Goon upper management not knowing about it?

Leadership? What? The guy was a loan shark.
---
Thank you for your utmost valuable contribution to /r/EVE.
---
Yes, dark filaments are terrible because your drones can’t track enemies while moving at the speeds a dark filament sends them zooming around at, and they also slingshot themselves out of their range. 
---
That specific setup I listed was for a gamma, although I don’t think you’d have to make too many changes to do it in a different type, as long as that type isn’t dark

Man PGL fleets are my number 1 favourite part of Eve.  One time some random dude in general convinced everyone to X up in fleet randomly just to set him off and boy did that work.  :D
---
Pretty sure he asked who the fuck did that 20 times in a row, I was 99% sure he was going to turn the fleet around and go home.
---
Also, for t3 filaments you shouldn’t ever lose a gila with four faction shield extenders, I was thinking of t4
---
Go welp another dreadbomb, scrub
---
On a personal level?  I'm sure it could happen.  On an "embezzling from the alliance" level, it seems pretty unlikely.
---
The two are best buds, total psychopaths 
---
Who’s Aryth ?
---
He's not leadership lol, just a dude offering loans. 
---
wormholer perspective:
---
pulse lasers are amazing weapons, especially large. blood raider and sansha ships are very good. armor tank is the best. their t2 and t3 choices are very good as well: malediction, confessor, curse, devoter, sacrilege, damnation, legion, paladin
---
amarr are awesome. 
---
Or offer to pay for hand amputation 
---
the structure of your questions mostly overlap
---
I'll simplify. Yes they're fine.
---
Your only real limitation is that you're generally going to be shoehorned into kiting style. Not many brawling amarr ships live to tell about it. At least not solo.
---
You've got moxie, kid
---
3. *Generally* speaking, Amarr is a fleet race, their ships are designed with lots of other allied ships being present in mind. That said, some of the best kiting ships are on the Amarr lineup. Some Amarr ships can be fit to be competitive in other archetypes as well, but in general Amarr lacks the flexibility of the other races.
---
Well, more ISK for me then ! What would be required for T4 filaments, in terms of ISK and fit ?
---
Be cool and have fun.

I've seen the average Eve player, ain't nobody want to see that.

Especially when loans are involved, that's just fucked up. All those people are now out of their collateral and possibly a good chunk of ISK

what is RMT ?

It’s a sad day in EVE when an enterprising man can’t have a trillion isk here and there without getting banned!

God bl*ss 20bil loan and I don't have to pay it back 
---
Nice get in the car were going for an adventure!!!!!
---
Guess he can never loan again
---
It's unlikely that you will see a CSM be involved in any form of RMT. CCP IA actually does a bunch of background checks on them to make sure they are not involved in bad things

Umm, in the lows I think I put 2 DDAs and one BCU, and the highs are just t2 launchers and a nos. 
---
For missile/drone choice I use explosive, although I’ve heard you’re slightly better off using kinetic/therm missiles on certain enemies which have a kin/therm natural hole. 
---
For implants I just had a 3% Shield capacity and a zor (the cheap one), to give myself more hp and keep my AB going just a bit longer under neuts
---
hey nolak, can i have a loan ? 
---
real money trading. like when you sell in game stuff for real $

its the "look at" thing, it slowly pans back when the ship dies, (go try it on a gate rat or something, its fairly nice)

Imagine being so out of touch to fall for reddit propaganda shitposts.
---
If you want to have a 100% chance to survive a t4 I think you need a few bil. But to survive enough of them to be profitable you don’t need nearly as much. That fit nearly broke even for me using faction drones, missiles, and having Caldari cruiser at IV, and doing a pretty bad job at piloting. 
---
Using t2 weapons with good skills, only a few unlucky spawns will be able to kill you, especially if you just rush for the bio adaptive cache on the first two waves. 
---
I think the biggest risks are a drifter battleship sitting under a tracking tower with a ton of neuting ships coming at you, a large amount of neuting leshaks, and a double drone battleship spawn, since the first two can kill you unless you fly well, and sometimes even then, and the double battleships just have so much hp in a gamma that you’ll have a tough time making it, if you even do.

Yes I believe that's shit sir

---
So I could technically try those. Well, now just need to hope that CCP will seed some filaments on Sisi...
---
Ironic coming from a guy whose coalition just got absolutely steamrolled into dust by said mentally deficient empire.
---
The legend himself :p gj murry
---
People crying about goons / this guy being harassed bullied should think again. No wonder he is going on a rampage after all the bullying he gets from goons.

You always answer though. You can't help but get baited into sperging in local every time someone engages you. You are marshy have literally become the lolcows of EVE.

Hello, 
---
I am with The Weekend Warriors and represent both ourselves + can speak for our Caldari militia coalition blues. We have had some fun fights with you guys and would wish to continue that. We don't have any ill will towards you or want to completely remove you from pure blind. However, we do want some space in pure blind, so below is my proposal to minimize your losses in terms of structures and sov: 
---
Unanchor your Fortizar in EWOK-K and all other citadels in the YS-GOP  constellation and all citadels in the LY-FY6 constellation. If you do not wish to unanchor them we would purchase fortizars for jita price and possibly some astras as well. Also, you will have to allow us to have sov in all of the systems in those constellations. You can keep everything north of those constellations, including citadels, sov, pocos, POSs, etc. We will then not touch anymore of your sov, we won't place any structures, and we won't blow up your structures either. In fact, if you needed us we would be willing to help defend you at that point. 
---
If you have concerns or disagree let me know, we're open to negotiating to a degree. You guys have put up good efforts, we'd love to keep having friendly skirmishes. Unfortunately whether you agree or not there is another group that is going to come after you soon, they are larger than us, but if you remained in the area we could work together against them as well.

Snuff lmao

\*melts like butter to Phelden's smooth jazz\*

Here's some SP as recompense for shitting up the game, now give us money for extractors?
---
83 million a day?
---
My main makes 163million every other day extracting PI.
---
14 extraction planets
---
3 P1&gt;P3 factories
---
1 P3&gt; P4 
---
Can be used for broadcast nodes and self replicating power cores.
---
make that former loan shark DOHOHOHOHOOH
---
XD
---
Praise James!
---
No, some of Bastion just live in Fountain; they're nothing to do with the deployment.
---
:D
---
Hi chori.
---
Red Russian Legion?
---
Or maybe Red russian federation? 
---
Glad to hear you're good! Tyd is in safe hands.
---
hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhm
---
yeah lol that scrublord wasn't any sort of financial overlord, he was just very into the loan sharking game
---
....really. Nolak? 
---
*sigh*
---
If actually the GSF intel channels worked...
---
TVP is dead due to drama, Warp to Me is still alive and kicking.
---
No problem. 
---
I had forgotten about that until now, lmao
---
Forgot how triggered and toxic r/Eve was.  Have a great day friend!  Hope you find happiness!
---
Little did you know, that communism and nazism had their origin in the same country.
---
isk are removed ?
---
snuff complaining about batphones really snuff thats as good as NC complaining about them. Suprised it took you as long to press the blob button think an alliance your size would have been able to manage a couple of smaller low sec alliances you still have a long way to good if you want to reach CCP level of killing low sec try harder.
---
worth not having to listen to your fleet comms tbh, [your junior fc agrees](https://my.mixtape.moe/malaty.mp3)
---
Easy. Guns were already cycling, and he clicked on them, they cycled off, he got confused, recycled, and did it again 2 more times. Watch the video and you will see it 
---
As a spacepoor player, my crab alt just finished the slow-train to a rorqual, I started last august with a stack of MPTCs from the dlc packs, and just finished the 150-ish day train into the Rorqual fit a couple of days ago, I'm still working on drone skills before undock. 
---
Though I have a corpmate who joined a few months after me, but had a friend quit eve and give him about 100B, he was in a rorqual about a week later.
---
Kinda hits hard that it isn't really an accomplishment, and that planning and preparing don't mean much when you can wallet tank a clock. 
---
Hi, i'm yrg, nice to meet you.
---
I'd be getting a Samsung one myself because of my phone. 
---
Jita 4-4
---
sell me your isk
---
Nice, smart watches are cool
---
Who is SR again?
---
I love listening to FCs rage. Does anyone have a link to the capital move op from like 6-7 years ago? I think it was a goonswarm op and someone took all the best bits of the FC raging at the fleet members and put it in a timeline. Shit was hilarious!
---
Too bad I couldn't get a loan before he got banned.....

That was his sarcastic way of saying you are a fecal specimen.

The excavators are the trade off for being invincible for 7 minutes.

Unless you are auto-piloting, not exactly "as passive as possible".

For the record I thought you were an alright dude, maybe not at first, but you grew on me.

WOW WHO ~~reported users for violating eula~~ GOONFUCKED?

Cerberus, mid grade crystals, some 3% implants and some cheap boosters. Makes for relatively easy T4 runs.
---
Oh, i know. I guess you must be fun at parties, having the urge to explain everything to everyone.
---
If you ever get invited in parties, that is.
---
Don’t you just call CCP’s 800 number and get prompt and friendly customer service?
---
What coup?
---
I thought you were pretty cool, always actively trying to safe people in Ju Standing. o7

I had never tried it, so I wasn't sure. But it doesn't look like it works. - I just put something into a station in Stain, and the option is not there in the Assets window.

Not being a scammer for these transactions is largely how Chribba's reputation came to be what it is.

Speak to Scooter Mccabe, I hear he does lones.

Check out all the baits I get and then the ratio of the ones I answer. I think I'm at a good rate.

Oh You

Isk actually lowers in value relatively quickly, because of the rampant inflation.

Always bait them in by taking bait. And pray they don't bait you on that.

They were against Shadow Cartel.

Idk about the fight but I'm impressed they brought only a small peacekeeping force and don't, like, kept them tackled while anchoring a Raitaru to whore on them with it.

It was only 5 percent but still props for being honest and paying him

Puffed Out being deflated

I guess you never were taught that every thing you spend your time on is an investment. Either invested wisely or wasted.

Why would we even do that?
