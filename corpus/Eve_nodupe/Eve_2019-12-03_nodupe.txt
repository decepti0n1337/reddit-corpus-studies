I think I better understand what pople will use if for in that context.
---
It was 200 more people dude not the whole of our alliance. We brought one fleet.
---
On my phone here so pardon errors
---
1. I don't see the question here, but fly and do what you enjoy. Once you get a nice ship and style figured out, you might enjoy branching out and trying other ships and weapon types.
---
2. Generally speaking I don't think it's worth reallocating your skill points with extractors and injectors, but there's something to be said for setting long term (year+ long) skill training goals for yourself. Then remap your attributes to optimize that training plan. I know Evemon isn't being maintained anymore but it was a great tool for that. That may not be what you were asking though ...
---
3. I live in null, and my activities never take me even remotely close to that kind of income. Null solo is a hard row to hoe and will likely be challenging to turn into vast quantities of isk. In my experience anyway. Play the way you enjoy and only go to null if that's the gameplay you want. Not having a corp on your history is probably okay. Lots of people hang out in high sec doing their own thing.
---
4. Null requires a lot more thought and oversight in some ways, and less in others. If you leave yourself out somewhere you shouldn't be surprised if you return to your computer and you're back in the station in a new pod. Additionally most null corps will be at war constantly, making your attempts to run missions or do anything meaningful in high sec totally suicidal. To continue most L4 missions stay in NPC corps or join a high sec corp. Unreliability as you describe it would only impact you. If you're in a fleet with other people though ... That would be a problem.
---
5. Only make alpha alts with a specific purpose in mind. Also very worth considering making alts on your Omega account with an express purpose in mind as well. Like a T2 hauler alt for moving your valuable shit around for example.
---
6. Definitely find cheap ways to learn pvp. Ships with fits you can buy a dozen of and not blink an eye. If that's T1 frigates or destroyers, do that. If it's T3 cruisers ... Do that. Find ways to do what you want to do that you can afford and not stress about. Pvp and learning new things is stressful enough without losing half your net worth every time you learn something.
---
T3 cruisers are expensive but might be a good long term goal for exploration and pvp combined. But a much cheaper option would be setting up an Astero and hunting other explorers as you run sites yourself. Keep in mind though that you will inevitably lose any ship you fly. Fly what you can afford to lose.
---
Side note: herons have very little ability to defend themselves or attack other people. I don't think they'd be a good choice to learn pvp in. Cheap exploration ships for sure ... Pvp ships not so much. (In my opinion, and I am far from an expert)
---
Take all that for what you will. It's worth what you paid for it.
---
That would already be a 100% improvement! I hope for more but even that would be great for everyone.

One is a mobile game, the other is a PC game. What else more do you need? WOW has a classic subreddit and a regular, call of duty or battlefield has different subreddits for each individual game. What’s the difference with Eve? I come to this subreddit for stuff about Eve: Online, not Eve Echoes and no one should have to sift through piles of Eve: Echoes posts to find anything about Eve: Online which this subreddit is about.
---
go check out clear skys on youtube

Heh, soontm no more safe super moving with DT jumps
---
They most likely could do it any day but they don't have the balls as the majority of goons are brainwashed and the threat of them unsubbing because their leader got banned is too much for CCP...
---
Grinding for ISK is dumb and you're dumb for caring about it and you should crawl into a wormhole and talk about this post in local.
---
The problem is PA still wants their investment back. Better call Mr. Wonderful.
---
you can’t anymore
---
Hopefully we get some good mod volunteers. I'm pretty stretched thin as it is but it would suck to see the default subreddit fall into someones hands who just spams reddit requests.
---
We will move them all to /r/echoes since the other subreddit was stolen by some afk spammer.

Wormholes are a strong gamble. They have awesome loot but even if the chain seems dead so might be you one decloaking mad lad later...

I think people either skip or don't. I always skip.

However, on some games, things will freeze up after you click skip -- so that you don't save all that much time overall. I still try to click skip (hate the animations), but I wish there were settings to always skip.

First and foremost, get help: [National Problem Gambling Helpline](https://www.ncpgambling.org/help-treatment/national-helpline-1-800-522-4700/) You can also find organizations that will help you long-term. The best time to start fixing it is sooner, rather than later. If you are at the transaction screen, we've already failed a number of steps. 
---
If your addiction is serious enough,  I'm certain EVE won't be the only place you see this kind behavior. It would best to deal with this as a whole. Sorry if you've heard this all before, but its gotta be said.
---
2: ask CCP directly if you can place spending limitations. Or even just prevent transactions on your account in general. Unlock it when you need to (I suggest getting long subscription periods).
---
3a: Remove all  payment accounts from your EVE account. You can even go a step further and ask your bank to block the merchant entirely (they may or may not). Get a second account and set spending limits and only transfer the money as you need it. Worst case, put someone you trust (Spouse, family, etc.) in charge of that account or at least with the power to manage the account. 
---
3b: After you've removed your card from the account, block the account management site from your own computer. I don't know the specifics too well, but it is doable and adds yet another barrier for you.
---
Hell, you've already mentioned it here, it may be advisable to tell a trusted corp-mate or even a director/CEO. If you've given them your API info like a lot of people, maybe they can check in every now and again and remind you if you're slipping.
---
Overall the best you can do is set up barriers and people between you and your spending. That being said, even some of the toughest barriers can still be taken down by you if you decide to. Even if CCP blocks your money or even bans your account, there will almost always be a workaround you can use to get back in to the game. That's where the first step comes in. Make it hard to spend your money on Eve and give yourself more chances to cool off and reassess yourself.

Personal feeling so take a pinch of salt with it, I think this was entirely accidental.  Some weird ripple effect that wasn't predicted.

Just go read the dev blog.

AFAIK the overwhelming majority of T2 salvage is from relic sites, and those are also heavily botted.
---
Im guessing this idea came from some corporate idiot who has zero idea how servers work. Downtime for servers is actually necessary, as longer uptime can have disastrous consequences, such as your entire cluster not coming back ever, even after multiple attempts at rebooting.

I didn't skip it, but I happen hail from culture where boys are formally encouraged to be especially nice to girls, leaving potentially messy psychological traces which later on are exacerbated by joys of period of growing up. Results are often noticeable to everyone willing to see and people being people, someone will always try to take advantage of it.
---
People sure like to generalize a little too much, but that also means openly stating such thing above can occasionally exist is somehow seen as generally misogynistic. But since discriminational cultural premises I've alluded to are not yet uprooted everywhere, and last time I checked, human was still an animal at least partially driven by instincts, we will still face people exploiting one of our stronger instincts for their gain.
---
Perhaps we can come up with a better name than what we can see in the OP, but at least I know what was being talked about. It may be cringy, but it's real.
---
Lmao rip
---
Wait. Does that mean that station-walking is back? Was something added to last time?
---
&gt; Also it won't run on my Chromebook.
---
That won't be a problem.
---
&gt; So is corp hangar the only direct benefit you get from having your own corp ?
---
A corp also allows you to drop structures and to take SOV.
---
But the most obvious is hangars.
---
If you start a corp: transfer all shares to your wallet. If you forget and give someone director access later, your corp can be stolen.
---

&gt; tax-hungry communists
---
They are having problems doing it in Star Citizen, a game with that concept being in the design from the very first minute. Now imagine doing it with POS code.
---
Also, even if CCP finds a way to implement this into the game, I am pretty sure that's not going to run on your Chromebook as well.
---
So I suggest saving up for a new machine able to run Star Citizen. Doesn't matter when you start or how much you save per month, you will have enough money at the point in time when Star Citizen will finally be released.
---
Shares? Wow, that's a thing too?
---
So what happens if I have 40% of the shares, a friend has 30% of the shares and another friend has 30% of the shares. Does that mean they can take over the corp even if I am CEO? :D
---
You are not a new player and your name has been on this reddit for years, so i will keep saying what i have said, move on, it was two years ago, the fact after two years you still have these screenshots, speaks volumes. MOVE ON.
---
[Basically yes](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Corporation_Mechanics_101#Shares_and_Voting). You can initiate a majority vote for a new CEO. And as soon as someone gets 50%+1 share he can vote himself in and take over the corp.
---
Make them an overview column.
---
&gt;And he needs a lot of learning time to handle big capitals.
---
or 200$ in ccp cashstore
---
I didn't put it any way, some other user did that. I just made it clear resources were in fact being used; as it looked like someone disingenuously suggested or implied that they weren't and that was  pretty dumb.
---
PSA: eve only counts shares that voted. If your friend with 30% of the shares votes yes and you don't vote with your 70% because you are on vacation he will win the vote because 100% of the votes are yes. So only give shares to people you trust.
---
for lore purpose, yeah you are right...
---
for game purposes (assuming he is just a new player wondering where the people on the ship are ingame), this doesn't really matter. There is (so far i know, and ive been playing since 2009) no ingame mechanic relying on crew size fore something, basically rendering this kind of information useless to normal player.

Provided how consequences-less the game has become I would embrace at least lore reasoning behind one's actions

In a fleet fight, there is basically three roles involed
---
1) DPS ships, that tries to kills the enemy
---
2) Logistic ships, that tries to heal friendly ships to counter enemy 
---
dps
---
3) E-war ships that either tries to disrupt enemy dps or enemy logistic ships 
---
There is no ship that automaticly draws aggros to him

One of my childhood friends killed himself after stacking up his gambling debts (not in EvE, but irl gambling AND lootbox type gambling back when that was just getting started).
---
I think this is disgraceful, they didn't even have the balls to announce it in Vegas, cause they know the controversy around this and is still doing it.
---
I will fight to have the game banned in my country (where gambling is at least licensed nowdays) and on Steam. Ppl tend to argue the definition of gambling, and yes, it is different everywhere. The base premise is that they are introducing chance as a part of trading goods/services, it has "some" ties to real money (even if getting it "out" is hard, putting it "in" is easy), that's enough for my country to require a license based on my understanding. Try get a gambling license for a 13+ game, will not happen.
---
Oh my lord, I've had pretty much this exact experience with women in every MMO game I've ever played. I know how absoFUCKINGlutely frustrating it can be as they will usually have amassed quite the number of followers within the corp/guild/alliance/whatever the context of the game, so you will definitely get outspoken and feel frustrated out of helplessness. It's not fair, it's fucking dumb, and it's god damn infuriating!
---
well thats only 1 (tbf really small) post about ship crew, thats really not even lore-worthy...
---
and /u/kristallnachte you are correct that it isnt well known. In fact, i would almost bet that 90% of eve's player base doesnt even know there is something as a ship crew. Even CCP doesn't mention this in any cinematic videos, they always just show the capsuleer boarding the ship and than instantly fly it. IMO i think CCP themselves even forgot this once was a thing
---
SC is not going to be released so you are seeking this stupid idea to be part of the EVE.... jeez, no.
---
Tinfoil hat: Downtime will return but at 11pm not am so not in prime Korean time!
---
Good writeup, ppl who never seen gambling issues have a hard time understanding. And one thing they might not understand, is they THEY can have that gene as well, they just haven't come across their type of addiction yet, gaming rules and regulations try to help shield ppl from this, not always successful, for some the pull is to strong and self-regulation rarely works.

I think we never had this statistic before. I think a lot of players can estimate the timezone activity, but having it visualized is pretty nice.
---
Well, the bowhead already is a substitute suitcase carrier of sorts, for highsec. You can still transport these by bridge, I reckon? Back in the day (before Jump Freighters) people would do the same with regular freighters: convoy and bridge them around. IMO the game was better for it. Mass logistics should always require cooperation, IMO.
---
There's basically ship skills, weapon skills, skills for moving around space, and skills that apply to gun types(all missile types, all turrets, energy manipulation). 
---
Basically find a ship or weapon type you like. 
---
Say you like missiles. Ok now you can do a search on good solo pvp missile ships. Then you find a hull you like and boom. Train those skills, the magic 14, and the secondary skills for your weapon type. Rapid firing and such for missilss.
---
I see.
---
I'm getting focused on Drones. In fact, I'm learning the skills for a Brutix fitting that someone from my corp sent me which is based on drones+hybrid turrets. However, which skills for drones and hybrid turrets are mandatory? I mean, there's something like the magic 14 for drones and hybrid turrets?
---
I may be new to Eve, but walking around with your avatar seems like an enormous waste of time and resources that could be spent making the rest of the game prettier. Some of these Gallente ships seem fun to pilot but look like floating potatos. Cooler ships please!
---
Yes, I sound like the average consumer!
---
This is part of why I have no idea how anyone could possibly get excited over a mobile version of EVE.  I run dual 32 inch monitors and 80% of my screens have some sort of window over them, how the hell could you enjoy this game on a tiny ass phone?
---
I love flying pinatas
---
That's because idiots that call themselves "mobile gamers" are "playing" by clicking "BUY NOW!" in a cash shop and clicking 2 buttons over and over again for a hit of dopamine.  My grandma digging a piece of toast out of the toaster using a fork is more of a gamer than the average "mobile gamer".
---
Yeah, unfortunately despite what he does, there are plenty of brainwashed idiots that won't leave no matter what...

Is this cake decoration? Because I don't see any numbers.

Don't forget the circlejerks!  or is "BBQs" what you kids call it now adays?
---
&gt; iirc the number of people playing (in general) on mobile is even bigger than on PC
---
Thanks for completely missing my point. "The "number of people playing" is not the "group of players the company cares about". They care about you if you spend 100-1000$ per month on consumables or "gold" items

I love the Bowhead, too. Almost too pretty to blow up.

How do you steal a subreddit?

Look like you boys did some heavy lifting showing up in nightmares and haw dreads. Tri riding in proper doctrines. The lack of a test capital welp leads me to believe between you guys NC and Jericho's horde army you had well over 100 anti capital dreads frothing at the mouths on standby

Over all, good. More chaos to the gods of chaos!

Nice to see the other side of such a big and expensive fight. Responding Titan FCs were shockingly chill (as was the music) which made it enjoyable to watch -- especially knowing how many billions of isk worth of Rorqs had already died.

i was about to say that the analogy is moot since ccp makes its money from subs anyway and the 5 mins dont matter, but then i remembered i havent played in 5 years and the game has microtransactions now. lol, is that really what it took for ccp to finally get around to fixing downtime?

---
I didn't include belt mining on purpose because CCP have already said that no downtime will break belts respawning.
---
So, I was just confused. I watched that video and interpreted the batphones as being against you, I'll blame it on alcohol and being late.

Auto-removal of people from corps when they have remained logged in so they can't be kicked.

Supercaps vanish from grid even if they were caught while travelling.
---
Modules on ships that had magically disappeared finally get reinstalled. (This can also be fixed by trading them to another player).
---
I can't think of anything else which wouldn't rank up there with "removal of billboards caused the undock button to vanish" in terms of surprise value.
---
Didn't mean to upset your delicate mental stability there bud.     
---
I have empathy for others and do understand gambling is a problem.  But I don't go around blaming society or others for individual choices.  Guy might genuinely need help but he's responsible for his choices and actions.  Same as you and me.  point blank.  It's not CCP's responsibility to police his behavior.

C1-3 shattered holes and shattered C4s that spawn C3 sites can have pirate data/relic sites.

Unfortunately I had to use an Ibis for mine.
---
Regarding the Branch bots i had actually some decent reaction time by CCP, so in general they disappeared 1-2 days later + the according mail spam / 100-150ish in total. But last time i was there approx a month ago because busy, so maybe CCP just shifted the focus right now from Null to High again because of the new content there or whatever else reasons.

Hi sec Pirate FOB's go spawn crazy, with some systems having 3 or more within a week.
---
I admit being old enough to have no idea when or why that meme became popular.
---
nice data :)
---
But what's to stop me from playing all night long now?
---
This is why I am going to take names next time to see if they actually disappear. Do you know if the pilots are deleted from the game? Or can they simply not log on anymore (e.g., if you "search" for their name, can they show up?)
---
I am purposefully not reporting that many because if I report handfuls every single day then it would be harder to draw links between the report and the ban.
---
In Branch, I reported a couple handfuls and waited 10-12 days without an e-mail. I report a few in TKE afterward and I get an IMMEDIATE ban e-mail, so my conclusion here is the TKE reports worked, and the Branch ones did not.
---
You can submit a ticket ([click here](https://support.eveonline.com) or hit F12 in-game and click "Go to Help Center") and under the **Game Play Support -&gt; Gameplay -&gt; General Questions** category request in the Description field that the HyperNet is deactivated in your client. You can do this ahead of time if you like and our GMs will enact the request once HyperNet is added to TQ on the 10th of December. You will have to replicate this process for each one of your accounts.

cc: /u/Leehams and /u/protostar71 for visibility since you guys tagged me in the comments.

We'll also be adding these instructions to a help center article about HyperNet at the time of release.

He better not fuck up pushing that emergency hull energizer button at the right time.

Use nergals instead.
---
Still an extremely gnarly PVP ship.
---
Wait, people are MAD about this? WTF?
---
&gt; That being said, then I don't want players to log in to try and break any online records. I really want as close to a typical Wednesday as possible.

Um, you know who you're dealing with, right?
---
Mint and it is the most recent version

Currently working on an EVE novel. Very close to having a complete manuscript.

You are missing the munins, nightmares, revelations and bombers on that br
---
Lol combat at higher level. More like borefest FarmVille.
---
Highsec dies as care bears push out to belt mine.
---
Well you tried it and sounds like it isn't for you. Isn't the better question a personal preference on how you'd like to spend your gaming time? Isk is relative.
---
Man I see that and just think to myself... let the little guy hack all of them unmolested until the... very.. last... can..
---
moving regular caps is a joke. Just use stations.
---
Moving supers, on the other hand, is still very dangerous business. I'd be more comfortable moving a super through Null than I would lowsec even ignoring DT exploits
---
Remember reading an article about how there was a massive NPC fight that nobody even saw happen.. 
---
Apparently 2 groups run into each other and started esculating until it turned into a full on brawl. That's what I'd imagine would happen here.
---
well Iu lsaid "fuck this" and went to null and died gloriously trying to kill a procurer lol
---
Still have to align and warp. That is ~20s a sabre could be warping to your cyno and bubbling you.
---
If you do it right before downtime, it doesn't even matter if the sabre bubbles you.
---
How are EvE and EvE echoes different games? Well... for one, one is called EvE and the other is called EvE Echoes... the clue is quite literally in the name.
---
Emerging is more solid and reliable income for what you’re doing. The occasional drop in abyssal space makes the numbers similar, but with like DED stuff, you can’t always count on a drop during your play period and your evening can sometimes go wasted.
---
Pure isk, there’s tons of better options in null and WH. Try one one day and the other the next and see what you like more.
---
I’d watch a Zirnitra fight a Revenant
---
This might fix wormholes.
---
IF the ORE ships are supposed to be Gallente based with Caldari shield systems, why does this one look like a badger instead of an Iteron?
---
I've started running sites myself instead of selling.. Also seems to have been a massive increase of chance of getting esculations
---
I have never used Mint nor Lutris. I use an Arch based distro and standard wine. You have 2 other approaches you can take, either follow the eve uni wiki that has been linked in this thread, or install standard wine and download the client from CCPs website.

Structure Manufacturing is the rig you’re looking for.

Tidi everywhere.
---
yup maybe have a 2 type's  active and buffer,  buffer could maybe boost the shields back to full while runing and then boost passive regain and resist on the shield, but once the cycle end's you drop back down to like 20$ shield.
---
Eh, who cares, just another dread...
---
That’s a really interesting idea, it could also polarize your shields after it ends
---
How do you kill someone in high sec and loot them when the Guards come?
---
Right I feel like Im being baited.
---
I don't think anyone cares enough to look for leftover spod and subsequently won't generate anymore content or untamed PvP scenario that doesn't already exist.

You can't tell me what to do! I'm logging in all me alts and nobody will stop me!

150m/hour/account is higher than pretty much everything except super ratting.
---
as a software engineer I can't disagree with you more.
---
&gt; This idea is moronic. Daily 5min DT to help server maintenance is absolutely fine
---
  MFW there is *nothing* CCP can do that'll result in 100% of people being happy.
---
  Someone is actually... *Upset* CCP is trialing NO DT...
---
yeah maybe, once again the idea is "if you havent got help after this end's your dead."
---
Clearly you've never had to worry about DT because it probably takes place at 3am local time
---
You're missing the entire point.
---
How does a business recoup losses?
---
They make the money back with products, services, entertainment, whatever. Losing 5 minutes of time at the tables can be recovered by other means.
---
Any other stupid, condescending shit you want to say? You're right about the *time* but you're absolutely incorrect about trying to day its money permanently lost.

&gt; forces wormhole eviction teams to hold hole control for 24h longer than before
---
&gt; increases the amount of time we need to be available per day from 4 hours to 6 hours
---
Is there an option somewhere in the client so skip patches??
---
I don't really think the 2.5 days plus or minus 3 hours will really solve timezones tanking.
---
If it was a personal "choice" we wouldn't call it an addiction. Go look up the definition of addiction.
---
Yeah honestly, I was ok with people setting their own defence timers, it means for small groups if they have to work or w/e they can coordinate their defence to when they can play.
---
Unfuelled structures, on the other hand, should have NO TIMERS like POS SMAs did back in the day.
---
I am. When I said T2 fits, I mean a T1 ship T2 fitted. In other word, almost all T1 frigate pvp fits. And they cost 7-12m isk. The ship itself  cost 500k, the insurance give back 300k or so, that's peanuts compared to the fit lost
---
Slippery Pete/Sniper tengus with rails can be very effective, but work better in groups.  For just staying out of range with long range weapons, search around for tips on "kiting".
---
Whatever weapon the rest of your fleet is using.
---
Except that is exactly how it works.  Perhaps even more so in Vegas.  There's a reason there are no windows to the outside in a casino.  So that you don't know you've been gambling all night and it's now 7am.  If a casino kicked everyone out for 5 minutes a day a lot of people would just call it a night.
---
Food for thought:
---
Set the asset safety price to retrieve your stuff at 100% (or whatever, high enough to suck) of estimated value. But, have that degrade to the current Baseline over time. Dude who comes back after say 6 months or something doesn't really notice the difference, but active players who failed to defend their stuff or evacuated in time basically lose access to all their stuff for weeks or months, or have to pay a hefty fee.
---
Little wet wipe on the undercarriage to clean up the bag sweat after I escape a legion fleet in WH space and I'm good to go.
---
Ya but let’s say I’m not in a fleet, I’m with a small group of players and the only sniper or I’m playing pve
---
Be trippin....
---
Okay thanks. Rails have good range and I think lasers have the upper hand in dps?
---
I understand that, but I hope you understand why that doesn't apply to online gambling. People aren't being kept in the game just because it's up. There is a small segment of the population where the downtime is toward the end of their playing-session time that will just go to bed/work/whatever if the servers go down, but there are just as many people that are waiting for the servers to come up to get in and do stuff...especially because that's the best time to get on some things and try to make profit. It's a wash.
---
You monster. I can't imagine how big your sub list is. I only keep my active stuff in the list and I still have like 30.
---
baby step\*
---
Aight thanks
---
Oke cheers
---
Never heard those words in my life
---
depends on ship and fit but beam lasers are very strong when it comes to dps so probably beams in most cases
---
Good direction, let's just it's part of an iterative process.
---
So what is the correct answer and t3 cruisers are not one of your choices.
---
I really hope this is satire...
---
Can we start by banning your “ironic” posting?
---
"I have 2 years of subscription bought, because of good deals, but then I was hit by a bus and unable to play."
---
That's the problem with that kind of thing. (active duty. away working. away on holiday. etc etc)
---
a proper nightmare fleet.
---
tl;dr - How does Estimated Price work and how can I use it to optimize profits when selling loot?
---
Question 1: **How can I improve my strategy for selling exploration loot?**
---
I'm currently working off a simple heuristic for selling items: I'll only sell items to a Buy order that is above the Estimated Price that appears when you mouse over the item.
---
My logic is that I should only sell items when they're at or above their Estimated Price; since there's no cost to sitting on items (aside from liquidity, etc.), if something is in a price slump I can just wait it out until the prices go back up and net more of a profit.
---
*However*, this rule of thumb almost never applies in practice. In my experience it is very rare to find an item with Buy orders equal to or above its estimated price. As a result my liquid wealth has been dropping precipitously despite considerable growth in my net worth (as seen on the character sheet). To put a number on it, I'm selling maybe 2-5% of my loot on average every week; the rest just sits around because all of the Buy prices are far below Estimated Price.
---
Note: I use [!EVE Market Data](https://eve-marketdata.com/) to check prices.
---
So I'm thinking I must be doing something wrong; my current hunch is that I'm misconstruing "Estimated Price" to be "Average Price". This seems like a reasonable assumption to make, but after tracking prices for the last month (not rigorously, just based off when I check the market which I do 4-5 times a week), I've observed that the large majority of items never come close to reaching - let alone exceeding - their Estimated Worth. So unless there's a bunch of hidden Buy orders somewhere that's inflating the Estimated Price, it simply *cannot* be an average or else it'd be considerably lower. Which leads me to...
---
Question 2: **How should I interpret an item's Estimated Price?**
---
Is it a maximum price? An average + %margin? A historical average? That last one would mean we're in a months-long recession where everything is selling below average price, which (if that's the case) makes me wonder when it will shift back to a seller's market.
---
Based on the last month, I'm almost certain that selling items only when they're at or above Estimated Price is not a good strategy. So, what's the point of Estimated Price? Should I lower my "sell" threshold to 80% of Estimated Price? 60%? Lower?
---
Some miscellaneous thoughts I had when typing this up:
---
- Is the problem that I'm only selling through Buy orders? I've avoided contracts since they're full of scammers, and I don't usually post items to sell since I (1) prefer the immediate payout of a sale, and (2) have terrible market sense and would probably lose a bunch of potential profit.
---
- If it turns out Buy orders suck, then why are there so many of them and why are they so devalued?
---
- If I were to start posting items on Sell Orders set to their Estimated Price, would they sell? (I know this is a very general question and it depends on the specific item, just trying to get a general sense of how I should approach this)
---
Thanks in advance!
---
this is bait right? it has to be!
---
Yeah, I’d rather see low power structures more vulnerable. As a small group, our timer actually gives us a chance to show up for a fight. We’ve set our timers when we can actually defend our structure.
---
This chance leaves us vulnerable to not even being able to show up to defend our timers. 🥺
---
I'm glad you highlighted the important part about wormholers. You get a cookie.
---
It still happens around the hour that you nominate. The attacker can't pick that.
---
Nobody seems to actually be answering your question, and the answer is no. Hawks are meant just for Dark sites. You're too slow in other sites, and because of the turret falloff penalty it makes it harder for the rats to hit you.
---
Bingo.
---
The same people that thought complete removal of local would result in carebears standing in line to be massacred now think that the removal of asset safety will go how they think it will...
---
Protip:  If an idea requires that everyone's behaviors remain unchanged when it is introduced to be successful, it isn't a good idea.
---
People keep missing this exact point. The incentive will only exist (im not including blocs) for the slightly larger (stronger) group to fuck over the slightly smaller one and long term that will only lead to the slightly smaller groups to stop existing and will only enforce bloc mentality even further.
---
In WHs there are natural barriers to prevent this and worst case scenario blocs can deploy their superfleets to just glass regions for no other purpose than to eradicate competition (blocs wont start wars over some potential drops). 
---
The entire asset safety removal discussion is therefore very odd considering the dislike people on this sub have towards blocs. I really dont get why people want to give blocs full control over who is allowed to live in sov null.
---
No caption needed. Image speaks for itself just fine.
---
&gt; one less timer for medium sized structures! 
---
AKA no industry in highsec unless you're part of/pay the nullsec blobs? Think about these things before making such silly suggestions. 
---
Azbels get blobbed just because they're an easy 4 billion+ killmail and a raitaru can easily have its timer done by a single guy with three characters. If you have "one less timer", you'd effectively have a structure that is open to attack 24/7 and once anyone does all its services immediately go offline. It would leave the raitaru basically incapable of performing the role it is made for; no more industry for the smaller guys, industry is to be done in the nullbloc-approved structures (probably in perimeter) or having penalties in the form of having to use more time and materials to build the same thing (in stations).
---
I understand medium structures are a pest in null, but highsec also exists and breaking the game horribly for one part of the game shouldn't be a solution used to fix an issue in another part of the game.
---
The rorqs already won. They mined enough to replace 10,000 hulls each. Just let Volta have their fun before they failscade like the rest.
---
That whole exchange was one of the oddest retard slap-fights I've seen lately . . . and you think you *won*  . . .
---
goddamn dude you just keep taking his bait. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/RcgqIuc.jpg
---
Yeah, upping the WH duration from 0.5 to 1.5 days seems really odd.
---
If you're not trolling you're retarded
---
They're blue to whoever, but their alliance only shows 93 active pilots.
---
Yes, but sometimes you inherit 30 applications with such bad engineering and you need to make them work, quickly, now.
---
(And when you ask for more resources to fix it properly your bosses would keep telling you "don't bother, it's gonna be replaced in 6 months". For a year.)
---
Its impossible to improve, using your brain is a elite gamerboi privilege
---
I share your confusion. I seem to have everyone and their brother tag teaming out of their wormhole telling me I am so angry. I'm pretty excited with all of the attention from the fanbois, but I gotta tell you- it's a really good thing that make believe words on the internet aren't real or I'd be one angry dude.
---
I even managed to launch EvE at Intel Atom (tablet) integrated graphics...
---
4xxx's (haswell) GPU works pretty well on everything set to low
---
Can't you just buy some ancient geforce 620 or such? You can get them literally for a price of a small pack of beer, or even for free
---
Don't you love that we all saw these issues since before release and they are just now addressing them?
---
no. defender picks the timer, not the day. So the closest window after the minimum time detailed in the post.
---
It's fucking disgusting is what it is
---
Stop using so many word, the average WH IQ can't follow it
---
I have never used Windows and have been playing EVE on Linux since 2009. Works perfectly.
---
if only there was a module that allowed you to transform liquid ozone into friends.
---
RonUSMC, the day it was released to Sisi.
---
Exactly, which is why I run Linux.
---
Did you see the video that CCP put out about the no downtime? Right next to the eve online container was another one same size and assuming volume labeled salt. I thought that was pretty funny.
---
Lmao imagine running Windows in 2019
---
I didn't claim that escalations don't happen. They happen every day. I claimed that they don't lead to massive supercapital fights. Which they don't. Because prepared or unprepared, both sides have intel, know what they will be facing even in unprepared escalation, and don't use supers. Which is perfectly illustrated by FRT not using theirs in the example given.
---
Bring capitals bring supers, fuck those who complain. They know they attack shit under your umbrella and to add to insult they attack capitals to begin with so just fuck them and blop em.
---
??
---
Why?
---
I see the local alliance formed Nospreys and Caracals, Warped Intentions formed Harpies, TEST formed Muninns. This is quite a ways out from TEST staging, so they probably didn't get that many people willing to go a long way to save Rorquals.
---
Even if the locals tryharded and had 20 minutes to form, I don't think they could beat Volta. Better off moving out of Immensea and under the TEST umbrella if they want to keep using Rorquals.
---
Pinterest link. Disgusting.
---
huh? We are smaller than Imperium and smaller than Panfam/Winter. you guys keep saying that, but its not true. http://coalitionsin.space/
---
not listen to whiny bitches on reddit and do whatever the fuck you feel like doing
---
Blame google image. It was the top result.
---
Dota 2 player? Interesting... you never see those creatures out of their natural habitat. Fascinating specimen I must say.
---
If I drop my claim on Pando and let you guys recruit him, can you do shield &amp; armor on Wednesday &amp; Thursday night?
---
Its not about having a *muh' good fite* 
---
its about homedefense, saving your assets in space (Rorquals) and rofl curbstomping / killwhoring on everything thats not gone asap.
---
Oh thanks. I would except I’m actually playing eve echoes. Not eve on pc lol. Haven’t got a good enough pc. There aren’t enough eve echoes experienced veterans yet so I posted on an Eve online page
---
I'll do you one better. Yes, it was UALX and here you can see where the meme started. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhlNQYFwdw
---
Or make them like pos timers
---
My Logi FC - No more Scimis left
---
Me - Fuck it lets fight.
---
Content forts = best forts
---
Wanna say GF to the panfam FC’s glad we actually had a fight instead of nothing. Ships are replaceable
---
Shoulda prepped more but who cares lets just have fun.
---
I live in a WH. No asset safety.
---
I think mainly we play for the people; the friends we've made through this game. But also because EVE is one of the only stories gamers can be a part of that is continuously changing. It's one of the only games out there with major consequences, where one person can make a major impact that everyone hears about. There are a number of other things that set EVE apart as well. The real time economy is fairly unique to EVE. The politics, as far as I know are unique only to EVE. Lastly it's a great feeling to be part of a tribe of players that can shape the game world around you.
---
I don’t get why its 2.5 days CCP for the hull timer? Would not 7 days hull timer be better that way people can chain things between weekends.
---
For example, I’m attacking a citadel timed for 13:00 (Chinese TZ). I would ref it on a Thursday or Friday for a Saturday or Sunday exit on the armour. I will then contest the armour timer on Saturday / Sunday + or - 3 hours on 13:00. This is outside my alliances TZ which is for the most part EUTZ. Say we win the armour timer on a Saturday and the hull timer generates on a Tuesday around 13:00 + or - 3 hours.
---
I’m at work IRL around those times the timer will exit and so are most my alliance comrades. Should we not be able to have a go at killing the structure outside our TZ on a weekend?
---
Hope this makes sense.
---
Didnt think the drop was that loud lol
---
you aint gettin my 15 grand, gotta blap me first &gt;:3
---
&gt; he is putting his money and effort
---
Tbf these kind of abstract philosophical points are moot with respect to citadel balance. You can talk about defenders' right to pick their own time. I can talk about attackers' right to play the citadel bashing game at their own time. The game not being a job is equally valid for the attacker.
---
What should matter instead of abstract principles is whats currently happening in the ecosystem. Do too many or too little citadels die? It looks the latter to me; therefore balance should change for attackers' favor.
---
I don’t know. Feels like too much attacker freedom. Coming from someone that’s always the attacker. We get to choose the days, and basically roll the dice. With some planning you can get it outside their TZ with 3 hour deviation. People will stay up late, **most** can’t skip work early. So for example, let’s say my Corp is U.S. east-west TZ. We set our timer for 8pm CST. Aggressor decides to roll the dice and see. They’re entirely EST. The timer rolls back 3 hours. That’s 5pm CST. Assuming most people get off work at 5, that means the only TZ that is available is EST. They just TZ gambled into wiping out your home, and there’s not a damn thing you can do about it.
---
Yes this times a million.
---
And these guys hold your credit card numbers....
---
You're only allowed to kick over sandcastles that are situated under your desk at work apparently
---
If Legacy compacted itself into 2-3 regions, you would have a TON of space opened up for smaller groups to take advantage of and grow in. That's not a problem. Especially if resources aren't so dense in an area that you don't run into scarcity issues.
---
I fail to see a problem with a group that couldn't beat VOLTA in 20 minutes of forming not being able to wantonly mine in rorquals. I live in sov null, and I know I don't have a super umbrella to save me. So I make money in a different way.
---
What? Pred was late? Audible gasp.
---
Existing structures remain unchanged, If the adm goes up after you've anchored a structure it also remains unchanged. I got this information from your quote btw.
---
You don't need to be a hardcore player to learn how to bring a decent counter comp.
