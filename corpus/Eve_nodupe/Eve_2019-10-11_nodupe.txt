I won't be, but that won't stop thirsty internet neckbeards from doing it for a drop of attention from you. You know it, i know it, the rest of /r/eve knows it, that's why you aren't being embraced with open arms. But instead have been met by mixed reaction.

unless you know someone personally to make a deal with, "RMTing out" is never worth the efford, ISK is worth almost nothing nowadays and doing it via some platform requires further fees.

Play smth else and have a look at EVE in 1-2 years again. Having fun in this game is a choice.
---
I dislike being obliged to have a significant tank on any destroyer.  
---
Both rig penalties and stacking penalties are long overdue for an overhaul, especially anywhere that involves defense.  I don't think they've been touched since Google bought Youtube.  I'm pretty lazy on any given day, but damn.
---
The host of benefits that comes with that is more diversity of fits, less ability to AFK in PVE or occasionally even to do much familiar PVE content while solo.
---
It‚Äôs not that much money really
---
My boss is really big on document writing _strategy_. He's taught me bits and pieces over the years. This will be a bit of a rambling mess - I'm writing from my phone, while on a bus. 
---
Novels are read from start to finish. The end of a novel depends on the start of it, so you read it in order. Reports, guides, FAQs, etc... Basically every type of document you'd read in a business/office setting are _not_ read from start to finish. 
---
Sections within those documents could be read like mini novels. But as a business client, a customer, an employee, or a spaceship pilot, how do I know what parts of a document is relevant to me? How do I know where these parts start and finish?
---
You, as the author, need to make sure the audience will successfully find those start and finish points. 
---
I, as the reader, don't want information about moon mining schedules when I want information about SRP. 
---
A quick but important digression: do **not** write sentences like this: `if A is true, then do B, otherwise do C, A is actually true`. I have to mentally juggle the first part because I need for the second and third parts. But I don't have the information to fully comprehend the first part until I finish the fourth part. 
---
And there's literally no good reason for this! Don't make early parts of sentences, or paragraphs, depend upon later parts. 
---
End of digression.
---
If I _think that I have to_ read a novel to answer a simple question, I'm going to seek answers directly from you. 
---
On a subconscious level, I'm outsourcing the mental process of research/investigation/comprehension to you. I get what I really want; relevant information, and I get it for little mental effort.
---
What's also going on is that I'm _assuming_ the process of reading myself is expensive/time consuming/etc. 
---
Have a look at your document(s), _but keep in mind that you have an unfair advantage when reading it_; you already know what's coming next. You wrote it, and you're subconsciously relying on memory of writing it to aid in understanding. 
---
Imagine you were a newbie. Imagine you are looking for one particular thing. Are you able to skip straight to what you're looking for?
---
In other words, was my assumption correct? If I was wrong, then I need to learn for myself that I was wrong. You simply telling me won't work. Brains and assumptions don't work like that.
---
So it's your job to manipulate me into a situation where I learn it for myself.
---
For me personally it's just too much. I rarely use all the ressources my corp has available. I can't speak for your corp but mine has many information scattered all around. Teamspeak, Discord, Website faq, auth logins for wikis and doctrines, 5 ingame channels, Mailing lists, slack, mumble, a auth login forum. I'm sure I forgot something.     
---
You can expect new players to be able to read but I was in the same situation and it's just easier to ask someone who has been around for longer and knows how it works. You should consider a mentor program if this applys to your coorp.

A person this early in the game would not be fucking about on TIS identifying Matterol by name or posting here with messages like this. If you listen to the actual audio on TIS the whole thing is an attention seeking or promotion attempt. The audio fits perfectly with the OP post in that it was overtly "cute" and seemed to be sorta anime sounding annoying. I'm not a weirdo and don't watch that wierd shit but you get what I'm saying. 
---
Someone is trying to market themselves or this character. They deserve nothing but disdain. They're targeting the audience of Eve that sleeps on those wierd pillows with anime cartoons on them.

[Eve-U wiki on the whole deal.](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Hacking_101)
---
Well, considering the devs talked about it its not really an r/eve thing. And why allergic to iteration? Like no one is talking about not wanting the changes overall, just a little fix to it.
---
You do realise this is optional right? They're not forcing you to do it. They are asking for real players to help because bots won't do unexpected things unlike a real player. Not to mention they would like to monitor based on real accounts, not generated data.
---
This is target for a small gangs and potentially small scale fight generator.          
---
For a reason this structure is cheap and require minerals for production.     
---
My expectation is for this structure type is :         
---
* to die often                   
---
* have high return rate - aka in 2 cycles it easily pay for itself         
---
* sink most of the minerals it generate into replacement structure        
---
* mostly count as moongo generator rather than inject minerals into local economy              
---
People say that attacker have to big influence on the timer ... we can use the old stront timers as i don't want it to be created by defender.              
---
Defender already defines when the minerals will be pulled out by running the mining cycle on specific moment that will end N days later.
---
It takes 3 clicks to activate Insider status, it is not for devs only. 
---
First of all, most companies would never roll out insider versions to the staff - IT departments have enough to deal with, without introducing a potentially unstable OS to employees.
---
Secondly, a lot of Insiders are enthusiasts who want to play with the latest features. MS can get invaluable data in this scenario, because of the infinite hardware combinations that people use.
---
Actually it is.         
---
Look how many people hunt for the MTU, do you remember how many times people in old days reffed small towers to get fights next day?           
---
This is to do it the same but at more smaller scale as you don't need 1 cycle dreads to put this into reinforce timer.       
---
While the small poses stopped operation for the period of reinforce this structure keep running the cycle.
---

I like this thread. I play Eve for the fun of it. Not for the absolute hate boner everyone has for each other.

I‚Äôll add two

1.	Gideon Zendikar of IOU. Every fleet I went on with him, he was calm, cool, and collected. Great awareness and an uncanny ability to tell where content would be and what the enemy would do next. 
---
2.	Yamatosan also of IOU. Very under appreciated FC. Very risk averse in a good way. I always made it back in one piece on his fleets. Very clear commands.

Yes, that would suffice.

2015-era PFR FC Ninja Uitoh. Dude was like 15 or 16 years old but had tons of charisma and it was genuinely fun to fly on his fleets. He leads CENTI now. I've fought with and against him and have nothing bad to say.
---
DBRB and his bomber fleets. Dude can do some work in bombers and he's always excited about EVE as if he had just started playing, even though he's been at it for over a decade.
---
From the JrFC Discord clubs, I liked fighting against xXNemXx. He wouldn't headshot and would legit bring great fights in Catch against Spectre Fleet.

thx peach ;)

I don't get discouraged. If people ask me something I can answer right away, I will. If I have to look it up and it is a new player, I answer and link the source. If it is an old player I link the source of information (depending on how specific the question is I will use a site I have boomarked or [google.com](https://google.com))

Being in S2N during Halloween War was frustrating in itself, but whenever Elo and his band appeared to harass our fleets was just hopeless. Ishtar after ishtar dying, even sitting on titans, because the FC‚Äôs had  long since given up trying to counter. That‚Äôs a trait you just have to respect.

I once flew a titan into a planet, then subsequently lost that entire planet to hostile forces.

Seconded. Wind Spirits is a good dude to fight and he brings tough ones
---
He was fun to fly with and always had good stories. He just wasn't very good at internal alliance politics.
---
It was 13-14 when small PvP corps were mostly all assimilated / disbanded / inactivated.  I realize that blocs have been around essentially since BoB, however, it took years of player induced activity and CCP mismanagement to get Eve to that point.  Eve peaked when there were loads of small PvP corps in most regions.

Yes.  Not aware of the current status of the market, but we mostly had success selling fortizars, though also bult raitaru and astrahus, but even then those were a challenge to sell.

tl;dr - OP plays due to nostalgia for the good ole days, and the warm fuzzy feeling the marketing "you can do anything and be anything in eve!" gives him.

Are they critical of the Chinese government or racism against Chinese people broadly, these posts that are supposedly deleted? Usually on this sub it's the latter and that kind of thing can fuck right off.

At the beginning of the legacy and winter.co war before it became a race for the biggest batphone, we got a couple of same size Muninns vs Muninns fight and I gotta say as a logi main thank you u/CSMprogodlegend. Those fight were probably the hardest on a personal skill level I ever had the chance to participate in, it was so fun.

---
No need to pick apart every suggestion. My point was to give some ideas for alternative ways to think about doing this, not to provide specific solutions. I really don't want to get into an argument regarding the intricacies of azure resource security, pricing, etc. I do this for a living, I make a good living doing it, and I am well aware of the pros and cons of the suggestions I was making, as well the issues you mentioned. However, as I mentioned previously, there are functional alternatives to many of the things that  I suggested that are cheaper and/or possibly more performant in some cases, and perhaps a better solution within the same wheelhouse. 
---
Ultimately, my point is simply that it IS possible to host a service like this at a functional level without traditional hosting, and if you're careful with your selection of services and resources you can do it much cheaper in many cases. Granted with cloud resources at a much larger scale the costs can tend to trend a little bit towards the expensive side, but this particular service can't possibly be tipping that scale with likely not more than a couple thousand users (if even that) at any given time actually posting or getting data. The biggest cost in this case I would imagine is the storage and processing of the data. 
---
In any case, most services, including Azure also offer tools to control costs as well, by throttling down services during non-peak hours, or based on cost threshold, to give a couple examples. Perhaps a flat cost is preferred that is an option as well, which could still be improved upon by the strategic use of some sort of client app and light(er)weight service side logic.

Cool please shut it down. The best time had in modern eve times is when you shut it down after the blackout started and people werent getting the Intel and zkill envy that makes this game less enjoyable. I really hope what came out of the csm is that eventually ccp stops such perfect Intel endpoints from esi. Hopefully at least they get delayed...

I cured myself of spodbrain by extracting my Mining Barge skills, and became my corporation's most active non-Director member. We're a pure PVP corp.

---
I don't think you're being honest, not only with us but with yourself. Like I said before, for someone wanting to "share their experience" talking about the game it's odd that you spent so little time talking about the game itself and so much time talking about yourself.
---
If you honestly like Eve and just want to get into it, then all you need to do is play the game. Learn what there is to do, find something you want to learn how to do, and make friends with people that are doing it. You don't need a twitter account, nor do you need to make a post on reddit filled with information that nobody would consider noteworthy.
---
Aside from honesty, another important other thing you need in Eve is a thick skin. If you're quitting based on some (in my opinion, quite fair) criticism, or people saying less than pleasant things to you, then Eve is definitely not the game for you.
---
I would suggest you find some clubs or activity groups at wherever you're studying and make an effort to participate in them to help you overcome your social anxiety. You aren't going to develop your social skills by devoting most of your spare time to an online game where a good-sized fraction of the players are less than socially adept themselves.

*somewhat outdated
---
I would say yes and no maybe. To say that I enjoy very hardcore games, would be  wrong, for example I don't enjoy playing Dark Souls and Souls like games, because I consider their gameplay too hard for my taste. And to say that Eve is very hardcore? I would say mixed. 
---
Let me bring current Elite Dangerous as example (you can skip tho): 
---
Let's say you just started out in Elite, your first task would be (and stay for some time) grinding for cash in order to get a new ship. And you do this repeatedly until you get, let's say Anaconda, which is almost an ultimate ship in game, if you want something more OP, say, Federal Corvette, you have to grind for faction reputation in order to be eligible to purchase it. Also not forget you need a lot of cash to install top modules on your ship, and then you can say you basically reached your goal. But what's next? Since Engineers expansion, devs introduced upgrades to modules you install on your ship, and modified all NPCs to have ultimate upgrades, which puts your ultimate ship and it's top modules to shame, as even small fighters can overwhelm you in fight, not to mention it changed PVP. In order to get these upgrades you need to grind for resources, which you can't buy from anyone, you have to do certain activities in game in order to get specific resources you need, and no, you can't leave them in stations, which means you have to plan what you need to gather. And you also need to build your rep with these engineers, by applying level 1, 2, 3, 4, and only then highest tier - level 5 upgrades. Also I have to mention that these upgrades have random stats, and if you don't like current stats, you need to spend resources for each roll. 
---
Feel the masochism yet?
---
And there's more.
---
Say you you already fully kitted your ship and applied ultimate upgrades. What's next?
---
Buy more ships and grind for them too. And so on, and on, and on, until you have a full set of ship's with top modules and upgrades.
---
What activities you have there besides for grinding, or after you finished you grinding?
---
Well... You can do PVE bounty hunting, hauling, mining, exploring, faction warfare, and you can do missions which covers all above besides faction warfare. Also missions have Space taxi missions, when all you have to do is haul passengers through some systems, and bring them to stations. These missions are btw the most profitable. Since Engineers expansion, dev cut down income from PVE and other activities. So your only option to get decent cash, is either do taxi missions, or spend a lot of time exploring outside of bubble and turn in your discoveries.  
---
And there's nothing else, literally. You can't build stuff, you can't do proper PVP piracy or ganking because you get harsh punishment from game mechanics, only at faction warfare, but very few play in open play. Your only gameplay is just sit and grind endlessly for nothing.
---
I consider this way more masochism than what Eve has
---
At least yours is a nice voice to listen to while repeating orders ad nauseam.
---
&gt; For example 3-4s will take 30+ mins to scan a wh
---
Only if you take short naps between scans lol

I played for 10 years and always came back also. The pvp in Eve was so great that I coulnd't stay away for too long. But for last few years I haven't found it fun anymore. Somehow it lost meaning and doesn't feel the same anymore. Not sure if it's the game changing or is it me. I've tried playing few times but always quit after week or something.

That is a really good suggestion! It shouldn't be difficult to build, I'll work on this
---
yep reason i left null and went to low not to mention i was mostly only out there for pvp and lets be honest that dont happen with out a 100 jumps and then you get dropped on my 30 caps
---
Hi Michael, I too am an evecoholic
---
Surely that will fix the game
---
Not really the stations are Corp owned just like citidels only diff is what type of Corp owns them. Npc or players.
---
I could agree with you in Npc null where pirates hold sov unless the Corp has positive standing with the locals.

Lowsec is usually still controlled by the empires in most cases..
