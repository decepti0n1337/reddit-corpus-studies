Very off topic but how does one get started with DED sites, do you stick to the hisec ones or do you venture into lowsec?

EVE IS crap
---
A Celestis will shut down many kiting gangs and help clear tackle, and a Bellicose will help apply damage. Big plus if you have a few good tacklers too, to catch them when they wanna egress.
---

---
Look at Chessur's Small Gang Archetype video series on youtube. Fight like that against small gangs, dont try and do a smaller version of a big blob.
---
When a FW system reaches 100% you can bash the I-Hub to flip ownership. But if the opposite militia run defensive plexes and the % goes below 100% the bash is cancelled.
---
So it's important to go beyond 100% to create a buffer.
---
But that wouldn't show bookmarks. Would be awesome if they add bookmarks to the overview instead...........
---
Hindsight is easy from a AAR/BR. Having more dudes is always better, that's not in debate! We just didn't. If you wanna join up with us and fly logi it'd be much welcomed. For a small alliance there is a hard limit on how many friends we can bring to a party. Logi was holding our T2 ships easily, T1 logi was getting alphad. That's an SP limitation - those dudes cannot fly T2 logi with more EHP. We have a lot of newbros :) We also did have ewar on field, both in form of webs and jams, they also got alphad. But of course "bring more dudes" is something we'd love to do.  
---
He was in a Monitor because the last time we fought these dudes, he WAS volleyed by enemy DPS. In a command ship. This is a direct change in response to the last fight we took with them. Lessons were definitely learned - it was a mutual fight that we waited for from them and we had a lot of fun. GFs were exchanged. :)

Smells like they did a ctrl-c ctrl-v lol

A video of you just killing afk vnis is cringe af

,...............................seriously?

I sell fedos in jita. Hit me up.

Keepstars can pop up in no time, Jita 4-4 takes months. A bit silly..

yeah, that's a long time back, brings up a few feels though :3

This ones going in my cringe compilation!

Definitely need to be hammered to forget all the weird shit CCP has been doing lately.

Site WIP, check it out :D

Needs a bunch of orange cones to make it look like Montreal in Summer.
---
How salty is he?
---
Of Bob yes! I get the soft disconnects where I need to restart mY EVE clients, and the hard ones where I have to reboot my PC.
---
I also came to Eve from Americaâ€™s Army. Thatâ€™s why my username is FT Diomedes - the FT stood for the Fear This clan. That was a great game. The bonds we built in that game were closer than those I made in any other game, until Eve.
---
&gt; I did play Americas Army long time ago
---
As did I, until my PC blew up and I was omega poor and couldn't get another for a long time.
---
Came across the game again like a few years ago to find out all original AA titles were discontinued and saw the "Proving Grounds" and was like the fuck is this dumb shit?
---
Also Delta Force: Black Hawk Down multiplayer. God damn that shit was fun too.
---
Not really, generally referring to a "decade" by the calendar is 0-9. For example, the sixties were a decade, going from 1960 to 1969, it it didn't go from 1961 to 1970. I believe 2000-2009 has become "the aughts" but god knows wtf is going to have to be made up as label for this one. :P
---
Everything is right click
---
I thought it was a GF. Sorry you don't feel the same.
---
Were the appropriate permits filled out and submitted to site supervisor for approval?
---
You're still 73% snuggly.
---
Do Hot work permits apply in space? ðŸ¤”
---
Oh, 77% now...
---
Dont forget janitors
---
What is PH?
---
Maybe start with asteroid belt ratting just warp to the asteroid belts and pew, pretty low risk but a good idea to look up some alpha clone ratting fits, the more comfortable you get you can jump up to running anomalies (the combat sites that can be seen/warped to from your probe launcher for example "guristas den") a properly fit and a little more experienced alpha could maybe even work up to running combat signatures (the sites you scan down using a probe launcher or receive as an escalation from anomalies)
---
Yeah the fact that you typed this says you're a nobody, insecure about his status as a nobody. Lmao
---
Try out Abyssal sites! Theyâ€™re really fun and engaging, plus theyâ€™re great for making money and learning mechanics. You could both hop in cheap missile frigates (Kestrel/Condors) and run T1 dark sites or something like duo Punishers in T1 Electricals! 
---
Youâ€™ll learn a lot about piloting and how things work (transversal, keeping range, applying damage types, and different EWAR effects). Youâ€™ll also get some good ISK for being new alpha accounts!
---
Yes, and it's only happening on 1 client at a time.
---
Nice one doom
---
If you want the null alliance experience, there's literally no reason to pick horde over goons or test. Unless you hate yourself, I guess.

use her feminine voice to gain directorship in a corp &amp; steal everything.

Why do you need to be told why people need to be told what to do?

"I'm going to fly a ship that provides nothing but a type of EWAR that's rarely even worth a dedicated ship unless it's a newbro who can't fly anything else. It shows that I'm in charge and it's tanky enough to keep the red off of my killboard."

Reminder that Iron Armada was too strong and too independent that they had to join goons

Get off Reddit and play the game
---
Fun fact, both groups are cancer.
---
can you take my name out of your mouth for one reddit thread please.
---
who even are you
---
I knew what this was going to be, still clicked it anyway. I was not dissapointed.
---
I know the feeling mate, I have an 05 char and am contemplating having a go again now after reading your thread here. I went back a couple of years ago for about a month, but excluding that little foray it's been about 8 years total since I played properly. 
---
Seriously considering it again now though. I had one un-accomplished goal from before that I'd love to complete: I wanted to join Goons lol
---
You forgot about Mipholog and his 3 nightmares...
---
Whereas I completely agree with the sentiment, When comparing the recent PoE con and the recent EVE events, PoE definitely won the the excitement and content awards.

Hey dude, check what kind of rigs are on that moa. If they're large rigs, keep it stashed or see if someone will buy it from you (not for very much more than market, but people like a collectors item). 
---
They changed rigs while you were gone. Now different ships use different sized of rigs. All rigs on existing ships were changed to large, which are battleship sized rigs now. You may have a cruiser with battleship rigs! Doesn't change their stats, it's just neat. 
---
Anyway, advice: try out the tutorial and go through the career agents. Get a feel for the game again, figure out what aspects you enjoy, and start looking for groups that will help you enjoy those aspects :). 
---
You may also benefit from joining the Rookie Help chat, and maybe some of the other public chats (like Scanning, Wormholes, The Beehive, Bringing Solo Back, etc) even if you're not interested in those aspects, just to get more acquainted with the game and the new lingo that has come up in the 12 years you've been gone. Many of those chats range in conversation well outside their topic and you'll find yourself learning a lot and getting back up to speed with things you thought you'd forgotten.

---
Its happening a few times per week on my win 10 rig! Perhaps a reinstallation of Eve helps.
---
I'm not familiar with testing on sisi, how do you get the isk to buy ships if there are nowhere near as many players?
---
I have no issues with plexing to get money for whelping. I just don't know what will get me the highest isk:experience ratio. The flexibility of the tengu and Loki are really appealing to me, but if there is a way for me to prepare for those so I'm not constantly losing them and waiting for the subsystem trains then that would be great.
---
Any suggestions?

So I have played EVE since 2004 and joined PH 6 months ago, and it has been hella fun :) Got an entire program to help new players to horde/the game, loads of PVE and PVP opportunities. Bear in mind, highsec wardecs so if you do join be wary! If you do fancy joining drop me a PM and i can sort out moving anything you want out to null (we have a fantastic market in our main home system).   
---
Basically a fun (big) group of people with everything from TI roams to titan drops going on. Can be daunting initially. I believe "Join Horde" is the channel ingame with details :)
---
What's your favourite role?
---
Propose, quick!
---
Still silly. Lore is an afterthought anyways (as it should be, dont get me wrong, lore follows gameplay mechanics, not the other way around). But to stick in the lore line of thinking (which is typically useless): The point is one is automated construction, the other one isnt, for no good reason. It doesnt even make sense for there to be many people involved. See how a Keepstar is built from a single projecting device. (On that note Titan construction times are even sillier compared to a keepstar, if we consider size and functionality).
---
Win EVE and go outside
---
RIP Yulai
---
I was going to say this same thing. Its the only other game that has held my attention for as long as eve. I still play daily.
---
The person that wants to avoid fleet warps (so in this case, your prober) needs to click on the fleet menu button, then select 'Flag exempt from fleet warp'.
---
&gt; You've been here 10 goddamn years.  
---
This week is literally my 10th anniversary of eve. gtfo my head.
---
Been playing eve pretty consistently since, And WoW since 2004. and having touched pretty much every major MMO since nothing quite fills the void like those two. Whereas most games build up they've both built out in what you can be doing so much that the amount of content is literally staggering.  
---
That said, I'm super excited for the day a new successful MMO comes along as the only way I see it happening is if it's an astonishingly expansive and deep game.
---
Lol and what, the rest of the game is supposed to know these rules as well? You either drop caps or you don't.
---
Pvp is by far the most fun. Everything else is just there to pay for losing ships in pvp.
---
Telfort / KPN fiber, seems thats what the issue is on
---
No issues here at all. Maybe a KPN thing, not a CCP thing
---
Thank you for your reply.  I thought the BPO drew Materials from the Item Hanger.  I will check that this is in fact the case.  With thanks
---
yea players with similar issues noted the problem didnt occur when using a VPN, so pretty sure its an ISP thing
---
Dust514 was better. Yeah I said it.
---
Also combat isn't the only form of pvp. You have market and industrial pvp, as well as spy craft. Corp thievery and Intel gathering / misinformation
---
It's the VPN
---
Its between Equinix and amazonaws for me.
---
Calling my ISP atm
---
I'd be a dead man hahaha
---
There are a finite number of moons; even if one can't mine them all, stopping other people mining them increases the value of what you do harvest.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Disclaimer:  I'm completely done with mining, mining ops, saving mining ops.  Why people care so much about accumulating assets they'll never use in a game with an obviously short remaining lifespan escapes me.
---
That launcher looks like an older version, try downloading the newer one from the eve site
---
I would say try the new one, but that doesn't work 100% of the time as well.
---
its the international routing in the EU that is blocked for a number of providers
---
I have no idea what that is supposed to be but if your client is that old, remove the product from the system, download the new installer and start from there.
---
Lol. If this is going to make you unsub then that's kinda sad.
---
True, but a key component of the fire pyramid is missing... Oxygen. Although you may be on to something with the Hot item, if something could be hot in the cold of space.
---
Same issue here, Poland
---
IIRC killing people in opposing FW faction doesn't affect your sec status. Don't pod.
---
Because, despite all of its flaws, Eve: Online is actually a good game.
---
Can it run Crysis?
---
Yeah been getting this a bit lately myself kinda odd.
---
It sure was. Loved it. I still remember using my 2 dreadnaughts with a mining refiner between them. Max destruction with dreads and the refiner repairs the two. And the repulsor field of the dreads was a beauty.
---
Shame they lost its source code and couldnt remaster it.
---
Start simple. Astero and strat are both solid. You will always need a scanning ship. T2 covert frogs are better for scanning but astero can actually fight, great for hunting other frigs. Strat is a solid ship. You can do buffer or armor rep. Both are fairly short trains. You can branch into other stuff from there. I would also strongly suggest training into dictors. Sabre is the best universal one. Flycatcher is solid for solo pvp
---
Most important ships are rolling BS and a scanning ship.
---
Take a look into some Nano shops(100mn dreka, nosprey, nomen, orthrus etc. for solo and gang roamings out of the sns.
---
For wh brawls, there are drekas and hamnations (HAM damnation) with Guardians, Baal support and links
---
If you get big enough, you can look into drekas for whaling fleets or kikis
---
Can you upload the client, pretty please? I'd like to see the twinkling stars of the old engine one last time. One of the strongest memories of the old eve times.
---
Thanks /u/CCP_ghostwhiper
---
I can link it as soon as Im home, if you are online right now, join the ingame channel "Emerging Lurkers" and you will find the fit including the pod in the MOTD
---
There's no gear upgrading in this game in the tradtional MMO sense. You buy ships, modules, structures and replace them when they are lost/destroyed. There's no grind for skills/progression either since you gain skillpoints in real time, even when offline, though it is possible to buy "skill injectors" from other players that transfer a part of their skillpoints towards you.
---
It doesn't really require constant grinding to do most things, though. Outside events there's no such thing as dailies or things you're forced to do not to miss out. Most people I know play a few times a week.
---
Trust me itâ€™s better to do the research alone and become a historian than become a tourist and ask. Since thereâ€™s no authentic stories in EVE saying certain things can be unintentionally misleading.
---
A couple years ago I tried PS2 and for a f2p player it took days to grind for a single upgrade for your vehicle or character. Played it a year ago and the grind was way less and I managed to get me a couple new guns in 2 days worth of play. so I guess due to losing players and the age of the game the loosened a bit up with the f2p grind.
---
Sick as, benefit of getting into having P4 XP machines years ago is that i was able to get an FX 5950 Ultra for mine :D
---
I think the closest MMO you'll find with a close sandbox aspect to eve is AA.
---
I always went for the smaller outposts. Love how me and 3 other guys started taking it and 15 mins later it was an all out war that took an hour or 2.
---
Lol. You have no evidence to support this. People literally been saying this for years. A decade. Games fine. Lots of us are having a blast.
---
Train skills, play when you can. Get lucky on drops and it's no biggy. Mining is not recommended if you cannot play all/most of the time. And by play I mean afk in belts/anoms because mining is suffering
---
Agreed

So that battle for Vlill...not nearly as "ragey" as advertised apparently.
---
Email CCP support and ask them to suspend the consumption of your omega days until the issue is resolved. Straightforward solution so youâ€™re not spending money while you canâ€™t play... you fucking retard ðŸ™ƒ
---
More RP conflicts would be amazing for this game and give it some of the depth it had back in 2004-2010. I'd love to see more RP factions building up interesting content besides just the empire factions, assuming the large nullsec blocs don't try to ruin all the content.
---
Was a good read, thanks Avio :)
---
I was just on, got lag now I can relog in. I'm US EST.
---
Last night was a bit sketchy for the limited time I was on.
---
I joined Dreddit as a five month old character who had no idea the depth that this game had.  It was a breath of fresh air, having people to help me, instead of me having to learn everything the hard way.
---
`WE HAD 9 MUNINNS AND 4 LOGI, WE COULDN'T FIGHT ACTIVE REP BRAWLING BATTLESHIPS`
---
if u had webs (or even piloted decently) perhaps u could have actually applied damage, but sure keep up the power fantasy of being an FC in a monitor at the expense of your fleet
---
Yeah I'm not sure how that'd work either. But I'd love to see the net worth of alliances. I figure it wouldn't be totally accurate with many assets being in out of Alliance corps, but would be curious none the less!
---
Sabres, more sabres, must have more sabres.
---
With every passing day we travel further and further away from what made EVE Online worth playing.
---
I'd like to second that. After the server move I had frequent disconnects for 6-8 weeks. Everything else was working fine however. After digging deeper into this I was able to identify an intermediate router outside of my ISP's network (also in the Netherlands, heh) that was regularly dropping packets to the EVE cluster for several minutes at a time. I contacted CCP Support with my findings and 48h later it was fixed and everything started to run smoothly again. Big shoutout to CCP Support for this!
---
Fuck those guys
---
It's not really that complicated
---
I'm having the same issues. Last night at 5am EST it was an absolute nightmare. Happened again today at 1pm EST. I'm in CT USA. EvE is the only MMO that is having these issues that I've checked

5am EST happens when this comment is 13 hours and 25 minutes old.

Step one: Donâ€™t
---
The word â€˜feedâ€™ is probably the most toxic word there is in EVE. Such view of losing discourages risk taking etc.
---
How is this even related to goons? It's snuffed out if anyone.
---
Don't feed the trolls.
---
More like Hilmar360.
---
Could've been a Telia issue.  Doing a traceroute they seem to be the last thing before the datacenter and if they fucked up (which... has happened, I remember them being super flaky for another MMO, years ago), maybe they triggered a block or something on some systems.
---
you are correct and I am a retard.
---
how about you come fly with us?
---
alors, pas mal jouÃ© contre malediction, mais il serait plus difficile d'attraper un meilleur pilote. t'as Ã©teint ton mwd quand il fallait le surchauffer, scram et web aussi doivent Ãªtre surchauffÃ©s pendant qu'on s'approche. aprÃ¨s tuer le malediction, tu aurais pu orbiter le stabber sous ses tourelles et abattre ses drones, c'est nÃ©anmoins comprÃ©hensible que tu n'as pas pu penser clairement. tu serais mort quand mÃªme, probablement, sinon Ã§a serait un dank frag.
---
je n'ai aucune idÃ©e pourquoi tu inclurais ta rencontre avec le kestrel afk donc aucun commentaire.
---
finalement ce n'est pas trÃ¨s bonne idÃ©e de brawler un destroyer dans une frÃ©gate. sabres ne portent jamais de l'artillerie, donc il n'est pas utile d'essayer a les orbiter tout fermÃ©. cependant ils sont faciles a Ã©chapper quand ils sont seuls, encore plus avec scram, web et afterburner.
