That‚Äôs been his story since I met him years ago :pepehands:
---
---
---
Amarr victor!
---
I've been telling nullbears wh life is easy and safe because I've lived in c4s and c2s. The more people that love to wh space the better content we will all find.
---
With 3 humans yes
---

---
With 1 human multiboxing 3 clients yes, but you have alot of micro to do to get sub 10
---
Then don't read it. Imagine being so sensitive that you're offended by an article someone's written that has nothing to do with you. 
---
Eve needs more journalists and I admire those that go out of their way to show their passion for the game by creating meta content. If you don't like the article, then alright but there's no need to be a dick about it.
---
Which part? The part about reddit not being where decisions are made, or your dramatic I'm free from goons post a few years back when shit got tough?
---
They show hostiles to the people on the ACL but wont reveal friendlies to roaming gangs, nullsec safer than ever and local removal backfires
---
Where do you get that I was offended? Eve doesn't need more journalists. It needs decent journalists. The writing is shit. It's clearly written by a guy who doesn't understand humor. I'm sure he can take a class and get better. Right now, it's shit.
---
Just use a gila
---
right, that's what they do, but it's just tedious. tedium without reward.
---
I mean the leaving goons post was funny as hell, and i never said reddit is were decisions are made i said you're not the one who makes those decisions you press f1 on who they tell you to.
---
Thanks for the easy victory.
---
u/MukkBarovian come small gang &lt;3
---
Just to help contextually, FI.RE is literally blue in game to test - whereas goons are not.  
---
This whole conflict has been largely in FI.RE front lawn.  The rest of Legacy all supports this.  
---
A FI.RE ‚Äúbatphone‚Äù is a bit going overboard.  
---
More appropriately panfam is not coming to help winterco fail, especially if Elo remains afk for weeks
---
Can you give quick summary of what drones u
---
You use on each group of npc's?
---
You guys are blue why don‚Äôt you ask in your alliance chat or on a discord?
---
\&gt; no warping off, that's cheating!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
i uh
---
what?
---
Maybe tier 5 nova sites would be best.
---
From my standpoint it‚Äôs largely a stand still on key objectives because of tz mismatch. Chinese and Rus overlap a bit and so a little more aligned with XiX battles. However, XiX seems to lose it when they go at it alone. Legacy can win when it can leverage alarm clocks and holidays. If you have to do this for every ihub, every fort, Legacy+XiX needs more to really push well into Detorid.
---
For sure I knew that from his first post. Afk ratting is as fun as mining ffs. Go do something with your eve life lol
---
What is a Sabre?
---
I still think jumping/bridging itself should be riskier. 
---
To [quote a previous comment from another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c9jvpq/with_local_changes_in_nullsec_cyno_changes_are/et05bv0/);
---
&gt;I don't believe the *cyno* needs to change.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I believe the *jumpdrive* is actually what needs to change.  
---
&gt;\* Long distance jumps/bridges take just a long as short distance ones; one session change timer.  
---
&gt;\* Big ships and small ships land at the same distance from the cyno; 5000 metres.  
---
&gt;These two points mean that there's no downside (other than bumping) to having every F1 monkey pour through the cyno.  
---
&gt;So, yes, the current teleportation mechanics still favour the biggest null-blocs.
---
They did - panfam is busy staying docked up playing wow and didn‚Äôt come.   
---
If elo and panfam get like this was a cause worth investing in they would have come.  
---
Test/legacy is now 5 ihubs down in frat space and counting.  We have 3 astras in 03-4, (frat main detorid staging and where elo Hs been logged off for a few weeks in).  
---
To say things have been ‚Äúchallenging‚Äù for frat lately is being kind
---
Most groups tend to bring in a carrier/aeon/fax as a main cyno for a super fleet, having sent THAT through via say a frig or ceptor? at least that I have seen.
---
Make it a 60 second timer to match gate cloak.
---
I actually like any of the first two items as well, the disabling the jump drive thing is already real since you can't move or jump once its lit.
---
They never wanted all that SOV they were told to take it. And they only went down there after 2 years of being away from the game to learn new game mechanics because nothing is the same. But because of their name no one will allow that to happen.
---
Yes, it'll reveal deposits on the heat map that aren't visible otherwise. This can be valuable on planets that have lots of  other people's extractors.
---
It's a shame that they don't make modules in EVE that prevent warping.
---
"build up their funds" I think you underestimate how insanely wealthy NCPL are.
---
Why are you so dense?
---
Golden opportunity for you to start a more successful website then. Except you won't.
---
&gt; who's next? Elise?üòâ
---
already is.
---
All of mine are at IV and I can definitely make P4
---
Didn't think they would warp off thought they would really have some honor
---
As mighty beans leadership we dont give a shit bout the brawl it was fun and so were the fights after. Once I find who wrote this they are getting an ass whooping
---
You are right. I dont have time. My research won't publish itself.
---
Same but come have fun for the rest of the summer.
---
Surprise plot twist part 2: Observatories will be released to restore local and will be deployable in wormholes.
---
I saw slyce's sov down there being reffed and I admit, it felt a bit bad.
---
It was "cool" having that thing happening.
---
Then I suggest you focus on that instead gratuitously shitting on content creators who are capable of doing what you aren't.
---
shhh dont tell them! they should just keep buying my overpriced recons
---
I think he may be mistakenly referring to max efficiency for P4
---
Holy fuck. Haven't played for a while and this is amazing news.
---
That would be so much fun.
---
That's a really bad attempt at insulting my abilities. I'm sure you can do better.
---
Lol...while my mains are roaming, new ships will be cooking. You act as if one cant be the other.
---
Thanks me too.
---
Can you quantify how much of a difference it makes?
---
Are there spots on the map that categorically can't be seen otherwise?
---
That one,genuinely, made me giggle. Thanks for that. Have a nice day :)
---
Since both of you are arguing in circles, what if mobile inhibs didnt totally prevent lighting a cyno but caused some sort of cyno delay or spool. 
---
Under normal circumstances the cyno goes right up, however if you get an inhib down (60s is too long but instant is too short, maybe 20s?) then the cyno has a (2?) minute spool before lighting? Maybe longer maybe shorter. Just trying to think for both sides instead of the whoever pushed it first.
---
Still no. They have bots sitting like 5 systems away and report to bot krabs when anyone in local. The intel should be acquired with proactive effort, for instance, sitting on a gate and have an active lock on the ship.
---
as long as frigates such as ceptors/destroyers can light cynos i see no reason for corvettes to not be able to, their cost is just as negligible and they're even better
---
Where are the minerals going to come from? Goons? oh wait Null first cartel.
---
I‚Äôm fine with this too, but I don‚Äôt expect CCP to go all the way. I think it more likely that they actually give us an easier to defend version of what I proposed. CCP is great at finding the compromise position that doesn‚Äôt change anything and pisses everyone off.
---
This would be dead wrong mate
---
&gt; FI.RE is literally blue in game to tes
---
Most alliances are. Very filthy.
---
I think if you're jumping supercarriers or titans in, your inbound cyno needs to be at least a battlecruiser, probably even a battleship. 
---
It's not necessarily just about the value of the asset that has to be pinned down, but more so everything that goes with the hull, such as its speed, agility and fitting.
---
If you want to drop capitals at zero, you should have to find a way to get a larger, heavier ship into position if the guys who are already there have taken preventative action.
---
Change your tag to Goons or INIT and get double the downvotes for the same post!
---
Unfortunately, this could be a reality. Except it will also have a damage cap higher than any other structure and ECM burst strong enough to jam Supercapitals.
---
I prefer no local but would happily accept observatories giving a delayed local - say 20 seconds or so.
---
Polarized versions of the t2 systems give a decent boost of DPS but negate your resists when fit.
---
Niche uses, structure or POS bashes, or used with plenty of logic support. Some wing nuts fit massive active tanks to compensate (Have the spare slots for cap etc. since resist mods are useless) like X-Type X-large shield boosters on a cruiser and go solo or small gang pvp/pave
---
( Àò ¬≥Àò)‚ô•
---
GF
---
Yeah no.  Not even goons are.  I know it‚Äôs funny to meme that but no.  Test isn‚Äôt blue to most of the game.
---
Aha! Did you just ‚ÄúNo I‚Äôm not, you are!‚Äù this guy? What a smooth and classy fucker you are. üòÇ
---
Thanks for noticing. :)
---
This is based on my hopeful expectations tempered by 12  years of dealing with CCP. I am all in favor of no local in Nullsec. I just don‚Äôt think CCP will go that far. I am too pessimistic that they will throw the empire builders another tool to mitigate no local changes. If we are lucky we get something like what I proposed, but I think it‚Äôs much more likely we get something as cancerous as current local that is not easy to interrupt.
---
PS - I miss your whaling fleets from when Horde lives in Fade. Some of the best fun I ever had in Eve.
---
What a whirlwind eve has been huh?
---
So the krabs have reached stage 4 of [7 stages](https://dz9yg0snnohlc.cloudfront.net/new-understanding-the-stages-of-grief-1.png).
---
I'd argue as always that the problem isn't the cyno but the ships that come through it. I can definitely see the merit of your example scenario but from my perspective it'd just be a minor QoL improvement, I've specifically used cloaky recons in the past because of their 5 min cyno duration.
---
The cyno ceptor concern is a non-issue as basically everyone already uses Maledictions and Ares which get sufficient cargo with 1 expander and &lt;2s alighn with the rest of the slots wasily.
---
Test has an absurd amount of blues comparatively, and strategically goons are blue. Test and goons will never have a real fight.
---
As for memes, you've had corps leaving alliances within test because they're sick of the list of blues.
---
You assume my tag is my alliance.
---
Yeah, trying to get /u/CCP_Falcon to talk about anything is impossible.
---
SoonTM
---
Yes use them but if they explode its the end of it.
---
&gt; I bet he also blames groups like Evictus for joining :') 
---
i bet he doesn't
---
K. Cause you so smart
---
&gt; I think if you're jumping supercarriers or titans in, your inbound cyno needs to be at least a battlecruiser, probably even a battleship.
---
I think you're misunderstanding what /u/semajal is correctly pointing out.
---
* Light cyno in ship you expect to die, 1 designated regular capital jumps to it.
---
* Capital lights his cyno
---
* Rest of the stuff jumps/bridges
---
This is mainly a concern with titan bridges as you can land in the sun and also the titan has to wait 60s for the bridge to go down even if the cyno dies.
---
\*shrugs\* The game's a little too slow to keep my attention for more than a few weeks at a go.
---
CRY MORE
---
I don't think you can call mechanics that are not even mentioned in the game and involve complex formulae "basic knowledge".
---
just have to remember to alt+tab back before the timer runs out. i've lost a couple of gilas due to forgetting about them. thankfully not the 7b ones though
---
I understood what he meant, but my counterpoint was that the ship that's necessary to bring in those capitals needs to have bigger requirements than it currently does if the people it's targeting are taking active measures to defend against it. 
---
That's why I kinda like the idea of a mass-specific spool up. It's (kinda?) self balancing. The ship lighting the cyno has to survive long enough to get that initial cyno off, and the same for whatever comes through after it to get that beachhead for the supers.
---
I don't like the mechanic that a stealth bomber, cloaky T3 or even a frigate can light a cyno at zero and immediately bridge in a carrier or FAX that itself can immediately fire off a cyno to bring in everything else.
---
&gt; where elo has been logged off for a few weeks in
---
did anyone ping this or something for you dinos to say? i find it hard to understand otherwise
---
I remember they had a resurgence but lost momentum at some point and never regained it.
---
Killing ü¶Ä and their guardians never gets old.
---
Make the spool up time proportional to the cyno time. Total time is say 10min. Can stop a spool but not the cyno. 
---
for every min spooling counts as 2 min duration. 
---
so 1 min spool 8 min cyno
---
2 min spool 6 min cycno
---
3 min spool 4 min cyno
---
4 min spool 2 min cycno
---
5 min spool 30s ec cyno. 
---
Spooling appears in local and is warpable.  (maybe give blops something here)
---
If the spooling moves or is shot, spooling cyno. 
---
Then set a minimum spool time based on class of ships.
---
You can put your wallet in there as well.
---
It's still harder to spot someone, especially a cloak-capable someone, on a gate grid as opposed to just seeing names in local.
---
It's our original one, XiX didn't get the memo that's a no no touch zone.  LOL
---
This is what I mainly based it out of:  
---
 [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Detorid](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Detorid)   
---
I'm sure it'll change tomorrow, or next week, but it's largely an accurate depiction as of now.
---
Hmmmm never heard of this
---
You have scouts chase them.   
---
Why would your main fleet chase them?
---
If 7 work like that, get ready to have observatory work on standing to. 
---
For the mini hack game ... Just no, or make like ESS/entosis when you start hack you can't stop it for 5 minutes, and if you accomplete the hack you need to avoid defender come to hack back for 10.  We knox a hacking game could be donne in few seconde actually, you just don't give time to defender to show up. 
---
If you miss the hack YOU (other hacker could try) are immobilise and target by structure for the 5 minutes and can't try again during this time.
---
Our 15 man group got 50 mill each and 4k LP
---
It doesn't really fix the problem unfortunately. Once a cyno goes up, everyone is jumping to it within a matter of seconds unless it's such a large fleet they're worried about bumping.
---
Any spool up mechanic would need to be based on a ship's ability to survive under hostile fire until it could actually light the cyno. A defending fleet should have ample opportunity to destroy it before it can get a cyno off. 
---
Smaller ships should have shorter spool-ups, but have mass limits on what can jump through to them, larger ships should have longer spool ups.
---
Exactly
---
No just no. Other structure stop work so don't consume fuel. 
---
And how do you want prevent that ? If people just remove fuel. 
---
Make it simple : you reinforce stop work. He use fuel only when online and not reinforce.
---
When they first came back they didn't want SOV they knew they weren't big enough for it, but some of the members threw a fit that they couldn't rat (basically crab) and suggested QFC so they could. Leadership thought it might work because they knew they've been gone for over 2 years and there have been a lot of changes. They knew they needed to re-learn the game, so to speak. But they were never given that opportunity because of their name.   
---
They negotiated one small pocket from SR then after a few weeks goons kicked SR. And since they were buddies with the CEO he told them to go right behind them and put up a tower as they were taking theirs down. They have never called themselves elite PVP they never wanted that much space. Every communication I've had with them they refer to themselves as group of people that likes to hang out, fly together, and does a little bit of everything.
---
You understand the remove local will not affect 0.0 as you think. You know that ?
---
They still fill a role: the individual member's anchor to keep them safe where needed AND a temporary long distance deploy for supers where you kinda short-term need them safe without the investment of a keepstar
---
They don"t need any delay. With that you want breack ennemy intel ?; Breack the bulding. That all
---
Legacy code
---
&gt; put falcons at range (70KM+) on opposite sides of the engagement site and jam fighters
---
people still fall for this meme 2k19, good lord
---
Your view from geminate is poor.
---
The systems we have taken the ihubs in give us cap projection through scalding pass, wicked creek, and western detorid.  east detorid and the bit of insmother are the only things we dont have direct range into from systems we own.
---
At the moment we have a daily camp in frats 03-4 staging that has been operating for over a month, corp deployments in wicked creek and scalding that are doing a lot to oppress those regions. We have well over 80 medium citadels in frat space, and at least 7 fortizars, they have none in our space and have been sharply turned back every time they try dropping them.
---
If you want the best illustration of the state of the campaign, look at this ping from last night in china prime.
---
WC-xiaobai : ÊàëÁöÑËà∞ÈòüÂè™Êúâ22‰∫∫ Êïå‰∫∫Âú®ÁñØÁãÇÂ¢ûÂº∫Êàë‰ª¨ÁöÑÂü∫Á°Ä ‰∏çË¶ÅÊîæÂºÉ PLZËøõÈòüÔºÅ
---
google translates it thusly
---
WC-xiaobai: My fleet is only 22 people Enemy is madly strengthening our foundation Don't give up PLZ!
---
"Strengthening our foundation" = we were toasting their sov.
---
So in their prime, in our far off prime time, we were taking 3 ihubs and reffing more of their space, and they could get 22 dudes for their sov defense fleet.
---
&gt;cap projection through scalding pass, wicked creek
---
This is a good narrative.
---
Except I used to live in Curse with good range, blops and capitals, reaching into Scalding, Wicked Creek and Detorid.
---
If someone ordered to spend time with pour souls to alarm clock to kill 1x ADM ihubs when you could have launched your capital attacks from Curse...if this sold well to the average null sec bro, more power to your salesman.
---
So, if I'm gleaning this large assortment of disparate information correctly, you made six and half percent back on your high risk investment?
---
This. My poor fucking hand after setting up a P4 in a new system this morning.
---
Requesting video...from phorde bomber warping to bubble. And comms.
---
Wow, good job ignoring all the rest.
---
Our caps are projected out of immensea, so, why would we take several mids to curse to hit shit we can now hit in one mid?
---
Since blackout is tied with drifter operation, what about to restore local you have to first cyno jam your entire system and disable all star gate :P
---
Losing 5 excavators to no skilled morons who just boosh them away because only a potato has the mental ineptitude to fuck it up.
---
Idiot
---
Polarized cyno would just encourage the use of disposable ships more, which is already a thing now.
---
Oppressive fitting requirements on the other hand would be a good start, perhaps even disallowing it outright on ships that are not bonused for it as this would remove some of the bullshit mechanics that are currently in place that affect small-gang.
---
Giving cynoes finite mass would be a great way to balance blobbing potential without destroying escalations if implemented correctly. In such a case, inhibitors could activate instantly and reduce cyno mass to zero, disallowing anything from jumping while progressively losing their effectiveness. The only issue is that finding the right balance for the mass numbers is probably beyond CCP's capabilities.
---
Check zkill and learn from people who clearly are better than you to pull it off
---
The point of this post is to theorycraft, Im not interested in a gila
---
this looks like a Good Time
---
Enlighten me on how I think. Local needs to go, permanently.
---
What
---
\&gt;  Our caps are projected out of immensea   
---
Ah you make complete sense now. Your caps are in Immensea, that's why you have to take sov next to Curse, because Detorid isn't next door to Immensea. :) It's not like you couldn't just gate it and knock them out.
---
You will not nerf super umbrella, and so you will just kill little entity. So you will discover this very very soon when you will during 1 week kill people who note read the memo. And after... empty 0.0 and only umbrella continue to farm and people will cry "To many cyno in defense"
---
To entirely wipe out POS they have to enable sov to wormhole first, since people have been building capitals with POS. If they remove POS prior to enable sov in wormhole, the one that already have capitals would have superior advantage over those who don't especially in those holes that cannot fit a capital through entrance.
---
What exactly is broken?
---
If you're within range of them. What if you aren't? What if they just jumped through one of three gates? If your scout thinks he knows where they're headed, or is well versed in the area he may catch them. If not, he will lose them. This is just an harder version of what scounts do already when chasing something.
---
I am actually all in favor of completely removing local in 0.0 and leaving it gone for good. I expect, however, that CCP will not actually go that far.
---
Sorry I didn't get back to you earlier. It took me a while to stop laughing.
---
There is no honour when it comes to fights, dude. Your opponent is under no obligation to fight on your terms. If you can't control the field then that's your problem, not theirs.
---
GG, no re.
---
If a small group owns only a small area then they could certainly reproduce it. If they own more then they're overreaching.
---
Can't tell if dumb or just troll
---
Yea, I wasn't as clear in print as I was in my mind on that one.  I meant that fitting a cyno disables the ability to use a jump drive, even if offline.
---
I was just trying to add to your good idea of approaching it from the fitting side in addition to the option of changing the way cynos function.
---
You see that's where your wrong, I want to kill cynos too.
---
We're taking sov because it belongs to frat and they are proving increasingly powerless to protect it.  As for gating caps for preset timers into cynojammed systems...  I mean are you a moron?  Again duder, your view of this conflict is very poor from so far away.
---
And you want possibility to headshoot everyonne in the game with no effort. Like a golden ammo maybe ?
---
Why tho? It would make no sense in any fashion, lore and balance wise
---
Quit bitching
---
It make sense for balance, they don't need 0.0 anymore if the start to make 0.0 smelt like WH.
---
And for the lore ... "Triglavian to coutner drifter make star in WH start to explode. SOE evacuating thera and offer help to capsuler to evacuate all asset".
---
...you can build caps in Sotiyos, dude. And Azbels.
---
Curses are cool, I can see them getting some use. Beyond that, and maybe the lach, cloakies #1
---
People are buying into the d-scan immune meme, and while it's a cool concept, might as well just cloak. Easier to get past gates, more damage..
---
I too suspect that they will not completely remove local permanently, but I, and many others, really want them to do so. 
---
If we don't say anything, our opinions will not be visible.
---
Beacause you know .... People who do'nt want local want free intel to find target.
---
I think neither wormholers nor nullbears want this.
---
Y'know, I can't say I agree with what all of what ashy posts, but your opinion is as meaningless and hers and my own, except she's trying to be constructive and you're a second rate troll, so idk what to say
---
Most definitely interested... Have my upvote
---
If you follow reddit narrative :
---
WH player said WH is more dangerous than 0.0 so they must be happy they will become new king of 0.0 .
---
If you see the reality : 
---
WH is safer than 0.0 so nullbear will not care and a majority of WH player wikll get blap very fast.
---
So i think a lot of 0.0 player will want it
---
Lol no. That would be silly.
---
Rule in life: How do you get better at something? Do more of it and tweak as needed. How do you not get better at something? Take the bad advice of someone who thinks you're bad and should feel bad and shouldn't be doing the thing.
---
If you have legitimate pointers on how to improve, provide pointers on how to improve. Else, do not continue promoting the problem you're trying to complain about.
---
Your just a virgin trying to white knight and get laid. Go home you thirsty basement dweller.
---
Not balance because the sleeper t3c production market is heavily dictated by wormholes and NPC guided value on blue loot. 
---
Why already offer isk dense faucet nullsec with even more income as is? Why make it so people can farm the shit out of highly valued items that would dump even more unneeded isk into the game?
---
OP, are you fucking retarded?
---
So don't change cyno. Cyno permit to people to answer to a threat not in they"re system. 
---
And remimber tyou have a lot of offensive cyno. If you nerf defensive cyno and not offensive ... trust me the ggame mechanic will be abused very fast and not for what you think.
---
&gt; Observatories require new fuel. Fuel made from data site loot and underutilized ice products.
---
Or maybe something harvested from a star?
---
Because that intel is abstract and requires interpretation, and doesn't provide instant information of who is in a system at any given time, only that someone was doing something in that system in the recent past.
---
If you'd ever actually gone hunting in null you'd realise how abstract that map data is and how it's no guarantee that you'll find content. It's not "free intel" in the same sense that Local is/was (a guy can dream, okay). The imprecision really makes a difference.
---
That being said, I get the feeling this isn't so much an actual point as some "gotcha" you think will make CCP bring back your free unlimited insta-detect reds system.
---
We're working on it.
---
1200 neut, before resists and/or falloff, doesn't "nearly" neut out 1837 cap... And that's a no-battery, no-implant, no-drug curse cap reservoir. Stopped reading there. You weren't joking about trying to capitalize on clicks, huh?
---
No if they send sleeper in 0.0 you can make T3 in 0.0. The merge could be so fun. I can"t wait tears of WH players :')
---
We're reaching levels of idiocy that shouldn't be possible...
---
*Proteus cloaks*
---
You obviously need help with read comprehension. So I'll offer you a point by telling you where you went wrong. Reread the comment you responded to. You're welcome.
---
This post is a shitpost, what did you expect ?
---
And trust me in case of merge WH player lost more than 0.0 player. Not beacause only pvp, blopb, cyno... just beacause of 1 thing : Organisation
---
Agree. A curse isn't an iwin, but being able to deliver moderate buffer for a cruise with a few hundred dps and two forms of ewar... All at once? Or trade off on one or two of those for being great at the other two? It's a great hull.
---
Bullshit, the NPC delta is the easiest way to find active ratters.
---
IF they actually get a working prototype before they start working on something else. Usually they hype some shit they are working on saying its gonna be amazing then it never heard about again.
---
Trying to get laid.. with a filthy euro? Hard pass.
---
Be a better troll thanks
---
It's not a shitpost, it's just a shit post.
---
That‚Äôs a one time offer, the only other way is from injectors, and they come from someone else paying for subs, or working to seed the market with stuff to build your stuff.
---
Oh damn, why did you have to disperage a group of people? I'm sorry I have to report that comment.
---
Shitposts require some level of thought, that in which requires a brain. OP, in this case, you don‚Äôt have  neither
---
d2w
---
Beacause if it's happen you will cry more than nullbear ?:o
---
... My entire corp are now discussing capacitor size and neut strength in Big Macs. Apparently a Bhaalgorn can destroy 4,075,000 Big Macs in a single neut cycle. Thanks.
---
Only because ratters are dumb enough to sit in one place for long periods of time.
---
And, again, it doesn't tell you who is in system, how many are in system, or what they're flying. It just tells you the change (ie. delta) in ratting bounties in a system over a period of time. Which *can* indicate that someone is actively ratting, or that someone has recently been ratting. But very often you'll get there and it's empty.
---
Rage some more, though. It's pleasant to listen to.
---
There is some kind of limit on how much you need to do.
---
I think the heavy neut curse is very under rated and can catch people off guard, so many people coast in cap stable 100mn fits and just touch that with a heavy neut or two and it‚Äôll slam to a half
---
While not able to bring them into low class holes, or can you.
---
You can't bring them into low-class holes, no, but your argument that you need POSes to build capitals is just wrong.
---
Basic supply and demand handles that. Miners will still mine across null. And in low, j, and high.
---
so whats the point of going to the center?
---
All of it, except perhaps covert cyno.
---
So basically offensive cyno are good but not defensive.
---
So you want be able to bring 250 bomber on someone but not have him receive help ? 
---
Golden ammo .
---
well to be fair, with no local, you technically dont need a super umbrella, you could in theory, just park your response fleet in the same system and just undock if someone is attacked. Or if all of your ratting systems are right next to each other drop t3 with a bridge from a titan or blops BS.
---
I am in support of this, although, a change to cynos so that low sec Hictor bots become useless would be preferred.
---
thank you kind sir
---
It's a good idea, but I think I want to see the miners go paranoid for a few tears before we get that.
---
*your

CCP: ok we stop providing API data for null as well just like how we treated wormhole.
---
Killmail is just people handing away their own intel to share (or to brag ...?)
---
Smart people just don't go share their "very free" intel on zkill. I have over half of my kills not registered on zkill &lt;3
---
No, just think this game requires balance: nulltards with 20 VNI alts getting notified with 3rd party programs is balanced out by delayed local.
---
C2 wormholes with null statics is balanced with 2b mass hole can‚Äôt fit dreads through it and back is balance.
---
Introducing drifters to nullsec offers nothing but some retarded idea.
---
Thanks for agreeing with me.
---
I think I know what kill mail you're talking about.. T1 frigate?
---
I dunno. I have flown a lot of blingy curses trying to do stuff like this, and usually people don't get remotely close unless they're on a gate. And if you do neut them, they're aligned anyway and warp our before your buddies who don't have enough tacs can get tackle.
---
Of course... It will need an R&amp;D cycle or two to get these things into the hands of the 'outlaws' of nullsec
---
Oh I could subscribe to this.
---
Quality content
---
You're trying to reason about this in context of "goons drop 20 supers on my nano gang" which doesn't make much sense. The way more relevent example is 50-150 man fleet cynoing in to fight another fleet of similar size.
---
You start introducing spool up/mass mechanics to fight the obscene oppression of escalation in the belly of a supercap umbrella and you pull the floor out from underneath subcap bridging, modest capital augmentation of a subcap fleet (e.g. single digit numbers of faxes/haw dreads), and most of all dread bombs which are the capital scale equivelant of ganking catalysts.
---
Hmm how about an upgradable ihub that can turn on local but cost a heavy amount per system used
---
I m not speaking about wh...
---
Only one raging here is you.

I prefer eliminating all of the cyno. Those 250 bombers will already be there since local is gone.

unfortunatly, we were not given the support of the full galaxy in holding the TTT. We are no longer the sole entity in holding the Keepstar and must abide by the wishes of the Consortium.

So much for your word.
---
Really? They are making a new anchorable structure?
---
Flip the filter to Sov to see BOZ1-O.   Then also check surrounding regions, wicked creek, insmother...

But then this only will really show the meaningless TCU.... We now hold 5 ihubs and have 3 astra in their main staging system of 03-4.
---
Imagine being this irritable over something that doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
Context?
---
Test banding up with more people - what a shocker right
---
So what, like entosis the ihub and then the local turns off until the timer starts?
---
Yes that is incorrect
---
Entosis the ihub, win the following timer, ihub pops along with all other upgrades and poof goes local
---
Ccp wants to shut down eve?
---
Wouldn't it be nicer if you could turn off local before the main event? That way they won't know who came in to contest the timer.
---
These are not cultured people.

CCP calls that ‚Äúdelayed local‚Äù for some reason. It‚Äôs kind of misleading.

Mr. Dictateur_Imperator, what you've just said was one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.

&gt; As for gating caps for preset timers into cynojammed systems

If they are powerless to protect it, just kill the jammer?

Yeah I saw that couple weeks ago, looks like a good source of conflict and trolling back and forth.  Any battles that have come from it?
---
I got to be honest, you weren‚Äôt close at all to selling me on your idea until you said that.
---
    In addition I‚Äôd love the ceptor that isn‚Äôt nullified to have that ability as well.
---
Mate, I was in legacy. Was shit. They've added blues since then. XIX got officially blued by all of legacy, not just test, now army of mangos - who're great fun to shoot - are blue
---
Go look at DEQC if you want a corp that quit a legacy alliance because they wanted more pvp less blues
---
Do you have proof from ccp that isn‚Äôt outdated? I‚Äôve only seen hearsay and speculation. Not being a dick, just generally curious and would like evidence before I spread the word.
---
Yeah it's slated for after they remove local from null from the trigs invasion. It will consume a new fuel and generate local in the systems they're installed in.  I forgot where I found it but should be on here somewhere.
---
I did get one of those rooms and lost a 7bil fit + 2bil pod, little did I know is that you can just exit the room...
---
&gt;Bullshit
---
I learned that you can just exit as the gate is open even without killing any of the ship
---
Yes... That would be awesome... Give them an actual use again.
---
Dude, they're likely going to add this anyways and this is like the eighteenth post on the matter.
---
Have some patience.
---
What little respect I had for TEST is gone with that.
---
Big if true
---
It works. In game channel Abyssal Lurkers.
---
Regardless, it would be amazing if it happened.
---
I got to present my ideas about this at last year's fanfest during the Q&amp;A.
---
My ideas in conjunction to some other's that were presented (to follow) were similar and was met with applause. In some ways they are similar, but in others, not.
---
1) Local is now tied to the observatory arrays. No OA, no local at all.
---
2) OA can be hacked using a data analyser.
---
-Success gives the option to Loop local for X minutes after Y delay, no warning message issued. (X set by CCP, Y set by the one doing the hack)
---
-Success gives the option to disable local for a longer duration immediately, but will issue warning message. This will also hide everyone in local from the network list as long as they remain in that system.
---
-Success will automatically hide yourself from the network list for the same X duration-refreshing. This is not the same as being hidden from local!
---
-Failure triggers notification to holding corp. And restores name to network list.
---
3) Successfully hacked structures can be counter-hacked to re-enable. Meaning you must put yourself at risk to restore proper functionality or wait it out. You must go to the structure itself to see if it has been hacked or not, no other indicators should exist ESI or otherwise.
---
4) Anyone can hack a OA and "look" at the locals of any of the networked systems (based on holding alliance) as long as the module is cycling in range. If on the structure ACL this hacking will not send a notification of failure, nor remove name from network list.
---
The idea being it creates a single point in a system where engagements are more likely to occur off a gate. Both hostile and defending entities have something to gain by hacking and monitoring these structures allowing them to be used as bait by both parties. The hacking minigame involved itself should be unique as to give it scaling difficulty based on the military index of the system.
---
Your point, please, monsieur.
---
So for no reason at all, this is just an SMA hate fest? I mean you troll them for trying to form up and fight with what low skill pilots they have and kill them telling them they should have stayed docked. But then when they don't undock to take an unwinnable fight you hate on them too?
---
Oh man, this is going to stick to you like Kleenex to fake fur after a furry convention.
---
That's also directly against what CCP said in the past about SP appearing out of thin air.
---
Ah yes well you must be 100% correct.
---
I was running a T5 site in a 7bil Gila + 2bil pod when the breaker at my place tripped (gf was using an iron as the A/C and a bunch of other stuff were running on the same circuit). I had time to reset the breaker, restart the computer, then the Eve launcher had to update (FML), relog and my Gila was untouched, cap was at 55%.
---
After some experiments, I came to a conclusion that despite being the king of 4b class abyssal PvP, the Ikitursa isn't very reliable on running either t5 firestorm or t5 gamma ray
---
The Achilles's heel is it's dps, the Iki will have trouble finishing the site within 20 minutes if ran into consecutive rooms of sleeper drones or damaviks(which, will require you switch targets very frequently hence defeats the advantage of triglavian weapon system)
---
BTW t5 firestorm is total shit, don't run it
---
Sorry mate... They didn't mention anything in the scope vids regarding this. Sorry if my post caused you any inconvenience
---
Everyday man.  Shit is pinged out.... every... day...

get to the gate, drop the mtu. more often than not you'll be sitting there killing rats anyway
---

---
Remember, entosis warfare is spread out between the constellation. If the other ihubs in the following systems aren‚Äôt upgraded, you‚Äôll be fighting in the ‚Äòdark‚Äô anyways
---
So create unassailable krabbing pockets?
---
Lol
---
Tbh, structures should use more fuel than they currently do
---
Oh yeah! Come on in. üòé
---
Roaming fleets do not warp to sealed conduits. We have seen 0 warp ins to a SEALED conduit (they can land right after it seals if they were already in warp)
---
We lowered it, then restructured management to increase stability and bring in new partners, effectively voiding any previous arrangements made with all entities public or private. We're no longer the sole party involved in the management of the institution, and thus voices other than our own are entitled to imput on how day-to-day operations are run. It's still better than Jita for a number of reasons outlined in the notice above, foremost among them: it's *still cheaper*.
---
Thats true, i forgot about that. Needs to be a steep price for that upgrade then, lol

Seems you missed the qualifier.  As their fleet numbers continue to dwindle week on week I'm sure we will reach the point where hc will decide to make those pushes.  The big thing is to play this conservatively and keep trends heading in the direction they are.  We are in no hurry.
---
There are many unprecedented issues afoot these days. Rampant Drifter attacks. The possibilty of PLEX being pulled out of the market to fuel interstellar coms. No one can predict these sorts of market shocks, but steps MUST be taken.
---
the alternative was worse for us, what would you have done? no one stood up to help us, so we decided to make an accord, and that restructured management. all previous agreements and statements came from a position of sole test ownership, and thus now no longer apply. TTT was great for you when you didn't have to do anything. it's still a good deal, and you still don't have to do anything.

Hilmar loosing his mind...
---
I agree. We should disable killmails API. At the time we had to post them manually, it was possible to NOT do it and so avoid shame in certains cases.
---
It also provides too much intel : populated systems have more kills than others ; the ENTIRE fit of an enemy is in there without having to cross multiples ones unlike the good old times, etc.
---
Killboards give too much free intel.
---
 Please inject the "Thinking" skill book. You obviously haven't yet.
---
I would anchor these all over WH space.
---
Of local goes away, so does the whales you're trying to hunt.
---
no one decided to help us maintain sole ownership and keep prices low, so instead we went to a new management scheme. \*shrug\* what did you expect us to do, continue fighting highsec tidi ferox battles so you can watch and benefit from our hard work?
---
This is a well-considered idea. My only issue is that it'll be yet another barrier to entry for alliances who want to make the move into nullsec, while being a relatively easy extra hoop for established alliances to jump through. Malcanis' Law strikes again.
---
Eve = Everything

He didn't raise it.
---
dude if 0.2% tax rate increase erased your respect, it wasn't there to begin with, you just liked to benefit from the work we do to keep up and running. it's still better than jita. see you at the TTT!
---
I pulled up some info from an old forum where someone briefly mentioned it, from what A user said is the real advantage comes when a lot of people are doing PI on the same planet, you will see true hotspots someone without the skills as high wont see and your estimated extractor amount is closer to what you actually will get.
---
You can't make supers in w-space. It requires sov. You also can't export more than 3 from each wandering connection, so your cap production and export is extremely limited.
---
TEST sucks,  obviously.
---
cutting off your nose to spite your face always works out well. see you at the TTT!
---
Yeah scroll up for more qualifiers. My perspective is just passing by there in the last two weeks in Detorid, nothing has changed. If it's changing, as I said could happen in the future (not some x fringe sov that they're not defending), I'll freely change my post.
---
They haven't even made the change yet and you've already resubbed, so I guess ccp really won here.  They don't need to do things, just say things and suddenly boom free income
---
I‚Äôm not looking forward to the setup. Planning on 18 toons over 6 accounts in a WH. The staggered setup as the other 12 toons skill into it is going to help a lot.
---
No. Just warp a brutha.
---
How about, instant cyno inhibitors in return for cloaking being "hard to detect" rather than "undectable and invisible"? Or is hunter safety too precious?
---
oh now that its way better, that effectively removes  capital safety nets when people jump in and bounce and it'd be pretty strong on the moving the capitals around meta.  Youd need to add that it must be docked to be fit so that in space refits weren't an option that would easily by pass it though.

---
I like the idea of the universe becoming more dangerous.  This should eventually cause a massive market correction and re balancing of the eve economy as hopefully bots and player mining activities bring less and isk is removed from the game. Which imo will lead to an easier entry into the game for new players.
---
A lot of new players are scared off from the game when they look at the market for the first time and see things going for BILLIONS of isk.  It is hard to compute that obtaining a billion isk(let alone 9 billion for a skill injector for example) is possible in a reasonable amount of time. New players think that the advantages the older players have is insurmountable and are not prepared to invest years to try and compete.  
---
You can tell people as often as you like that they will be able to do fun things in a relatively short period of time but they dont believe you when they see the billion dollar price tags on cool ships they want to fly and they only have 100k to their name.
---
Imagine being this irritable over something that doesn't matter.
---
It‚Äôs not the amount at all 0.2% isn‚Äôt much at the end of the day. My issue is with it is when you give your word on something, you stick to it. If you can‚Äôt then don‚Äôt make the promise to begin with.  To me that shows someone can‚Äôt be trusted.

---
We do this constantly, don't be upset.  You should be used to it by now.
---
&gt;because they can‚Äôt have their local chat function it wouldn‚Äôt come to this
---
This premise is incorrect.  We've stated repeatedly that we're upset because NPCs ended our wars.
---
When you explain the joke, it gets even shittier
---
But everyone else was
---
Sometimes the mini game isn't meant to be won.
---
The price increase makes sense because it is still technically lower than the NPCs.  If highsec does not like it, they can organize and put up a competitor.  Of course, nullsec will blow it up because high sec cannot organize in the same sustained manner as null.  
---
Got news for you highsec, all your bases are now belonging to us.
---
My training didn‚Äôt prepare me for this...
---
Grogoth is back
---
Keep being you Tristan
---
Eh, not necessarily.  People that come back still have to be engaged to stay subbed long term, and I think people are deluding themselves if they think this is going to do anything significant to help the game long term.
---
On the flip side, once people finally cut the cord, a lot will never come back.  After CCP's failures over the last few years, there's already a lot of people looking for the final straw to win EVE.
---
What I like the most about this idea is that my spai-alts could turn off Local just by auto-piloting around all day long.
---
The fact that your name popping in a chat box would make you log off is pretty sad and you should try new aspects of the game
---

---

Which would either open up space for smaller groups to move in or means the people who remain are those willing to actually fight for their space.
---
Again, you arent involved enough in the conflict to make definitive statements like you tried to in your original comment.  "I passed through tribute a couple months ago, Its an nc. stronghold" is a statement that is equivalently ignorant.

---
Depending on how organized you are and your familiarity with how stuff works, a day or two. 10 people is a pretty formidable wolfpack.
---
I can make those statements because I see it on the map. I don't need to be close to it, to see that it hasn't changed in two weeks. I'm open for my statement to change when the situation changes. Your opinion is fine, and emotions and feelings behind it, I'm just saying it hasn't moved on the region that matters. Stop being defensive over it, not here to ruin your narrative.
---
Spys.

For you to stop posting
---
Agree completely.
---
A lot of the world doesnt understand what a generalization is. It is seen as a bad thing for some reason.
---
I mean...no shit sherlock that every single person in his alliance doesnt think and do the same exact thing. A generalization doesnt mean that.  Shit. Rolf in Gone with the Wind was a nazi and we spent most of the movie liking him. But in general nazis were assholes. 
---
anyway. Generalizing explains large things. In General people think about his alliance the things he said and if he takes it personal he can leave the alliance.
---
The Drem was originally Grogoth Drem and left the game. Was a waffle CEO and ~important person~ in PL

---
&gt;If you'd ever actually gone hunting in null you'd realise...
---
You started with the condescending tone. I know full well how abstract the npc kills and npc kills delta is to use because that's how I decide where to go. It absolutely is free intel. Without it, you're left with best guesses on where to roam based on who owns the space, time zone, and security of the system. When you see constant kills over the last hour and the delta is green or neutral, you know if you head that way, there should be targets. Usually, the system that shows targets on dotlan has targets. If they're not there, it's usually because intel channels have picked you up in local. 
---
&gt;That being said, I get the feeling this isn't so much an actual point as some "gotcha" you think will make CCP bring back your free unlimited insta-detect reds system.
---
It's not a gotcha. If we're going to completely destroy the krab base under the pretense of "free intel", it should go both ways. Hunters should actually have to hunt. As it is now, we know which systems to skip through or avoid altogether because they're completely dead on dotlan and have been for hours/days. If we're going to blow it up, let's blow it up. 
---
Either way, none of the free intel really solves anything. All the shitty mechanics are still here that perpetuate the state of null. There's still no incentive for people to fight. We're still left with hunting vnis and rorqs for the most part. This is bread and circuses to keep the mob happy a little longer.

I'm just pointing out that your opinion is uninformed, and your view of the conflict is useless.

I dont think raid gear is a good comparison.
---
I would say it would be like logging into wow, taking an hour to level up in the starting zone to level 10 and then getting to stormwind and realizing all of the players are level 1,000.
---
It would feel insurmountable. Sure getting to level 10 wasnt to bad. but how long is it going to take you to get to level 1,000?
---
Now apply to Eve, level 10 is your first 100k isk and level 1,000 is your billions to buy cool stuff.
---
Now imagine you are me who only plays an hour or two a night.
---
Am I going to choose to make that commitment to get to level 1,000? Probably not. I think thats why a lot of people quit. Seeing those billions feels impossible.
---

Yeas as someone who went balls deep into PI and is now extracting his PI skills.

This is correct.
---
I hear old gods handiman is thinking about returning as well.

I gave the idea as a 'd-scan alternative' but if we decide to let it tail them then it'd probably be fine in non-bubble immune intys/combat recons.  
---
The question then becomes, can ammunition be hull restricted?
---

vily kept his word, but he was overridden by others. "oh no that super convenient market 1 jump from Jita is only .5% lower than Jita now, what ever shall we do, continue saving money? woe is us!" you do no work and continue to benefit from a lower tax rate than Jita. SINCE you do no work, you get no say. don't like it? nut up or shut up.

PGL's ball-stank has always been at tolerable levels, if it got worse we'd just switch to cheaper deodorant.

I would totally think this is a shit post.
---
But we all know all the major eve CEO‚Äôs are Gay AF for each other.
---
Luckily eve's skill system means you can max out a frigate quickly and be uber good for little isk at all.
---
POS are still around because too many people still use them. There's nothing the POS provides except superior protection to carriers and other ships with combat timers to find a safe place to go. 
---
POS is also easiest way to protect your bots. 
---
I suspect when small structures are released, POS will finally go. Currently we only have medium and higher sized structures + navigation structures.
---
what? i mean just have the scouts use the combats to tail the fleet, not some new gimmicky mechanic, literally spread probes and check the hit amount, now you have local again unless they dock.
---
Max a frigate. Go pvp. Easy, cheap, problem solved.
---
Salt farm.... I mean E V E ONLINE.
---
Vily gave his word and says he kept it, but he's no longer the sole voice on the board, so trust in him doesn;t enter the equation. It wasn't fun when we had to water down control of the TTT in order to make things work smoothly, but I didn't see many high-sec traders out there in feroxes helping us to defend the space. unless you were doing something real and undocking instead of playing the market, well, it's still better than Jita, and you don't have a leg to stand on when you complain about how we run the thing that we built and maintain. either put up a competing market, or be quiet.
---
see you at the TTT!
---
&gt;From my standpoint it‚Äôs largely a stand still on key objectives because of tz mismatch. Chinese and Rus overlap a bit and so a little more aligned with XiX battles. However, XiX seems to lose it when they go at it alone. Legacy can win when it can leverage alarm clocks and holidays. If you have to do this for every ihub, every fort, Legacy+XiX needs more to really push well into Detorid.

---
get fucked by what, a free service that we provide? your alternatives are clear, you're welcome to use them. there's a ceiling to this tax rate, and when the difference becomes so negligible that even casual hate drives customers away, it's a bad idea. right now it's still half the tax rate of NPCs.
---
Dude its dotlan you act like anybody actually uses the in game mapper
---
None of this is about slogan justifications like "remove free Intel". It's about making null more dangerous because it's currently too safe, thats stagnating the game, and CCP is willing to do something about it. 
---
I don't necessarily support wh local in null, but it doesn't make sense to ask CCP to reduce null risk in one way just because they are increasing it in another.
---
&gt;We lowered it, then restructured management to increase stability and bring in new partners, effectively voiding any previous arrangements made with all entities public or private.

---
Even with Local. Your boys never hit that D-scan. &amp; a claw ran away from my probe.
---
Most goons don‚Äôt even know what local is, in fact.
---
Why not adapting to it and stop asking for more safety in one of the safest places in new eden? You can literaly make tons of isk by doing unatended activities. Removing local is just a balancing patch. Just adapt, make defense fleets, have scouts, you know, play the game. That's all you need. Next time nullsecs will start to ask for a button to cyno them out into a blue keepstar if something not blue is near.
---
&gt; fuel cost to light the cyno by say -50%.
---
I am against this because the point of training cynos to 4 is to make the corvette a viable free-cyno ship.
---

Couldn't we give it a slight cargo increase instead?

POS still have a use in hostile territory, especially during something like evictions in wh because their anchoring time is very short compared to citadels. A small tower takes 15 mins to setup and able to protect you, allowing you to start importing ships and ammo, while setting up an Astrahus takes 24 hours. Their much lower volume (2000m3 for POS tower vs 8000m3 for an Astrahus) makes them easier to carry. You're still protected in a POS no matter what combat timer you have since some timers don't allow you to dock.
---
The password setup is kind of convenient for short term operations vs access lists and the password stealing can create fun situations and heists that eve is so famous for.
---
POS still have a few advantages over upwell structures so when we get upwell structures that have some of those advantages (especially the short setup time), you'll see them stop being used.
---
Sure, that's why the bittervets from '05 and on are resubbing in droves over the past few days...
---
Congratulations. I am glad to hear you are now paying tax.
---
I still have my POS's but i haven't redeployed them. I liked them for their ease of use,the protections offered and mostly for research and ore compression.
---
The Structure Belongs to test.  Villy made a promise. He broke it.  He probably should just transfer the structure to his goon masters.
---
I'm sorry, what exactly did I say to offend you?
---
&gt;Polarized cyno would just encourage the use of disposable ships more, which is already a thing now.
---
It would also scare the everliving crap out of anyone with a super fleet, which is a benefit in my book despite being in an alliance with one.
---
Drugs are done in the new structures these days.

You can park a capital at a small POS for ~100m isk, you need a ~10b fortizar or ~20b sotiyo to park a capital at a citadel/engineering complex. And a ~300m keepstar to park a super/titan. 
---
The other advantage of a tower is that they don't show in space if you're not on grid with them (they do show on dscan). With citadels and engineering complexes, when you enter a system you can spin around and get a general idea that there are x number of structures in system. Towers anchored to moons, especially those far from gates, can be nearly invisible unless someone is really dedicated. 
---
Towers also can be set to shoot at anything that approaches them without needing to be manned (though they're not great at picking targets or finishing targets on their own). 
---
Others have covered some of the other advantages.
---
Makes sense given the higher expense of managing drifter attacks.

You know Vily's promise that taxes would never go above 0.3% was AFTER the profit-sharing agreement was signed between Horde/Imperium/TEST right?

It was a good video! Only noticed the lag on a few scenes, an only noticed because I read the comments first.
---
Also, INIT, please break the blue donut by forming a coalition with Snuff and Gotg. Be the first to rebel against the Imperium!
---
A lot of game mechanics and code that have yet to be re-written use a lot of the coding for the POS. The current coders are having to slowly work through all of the old code to find which strings in this web lead where. Otherwise, the whole game come down. This is millions of lines of code. Each line needs t ok be checked, then have its references and functions checked. And then find if this line is referenced elsewhere. It's like ear buds. You know you carefully wrapped the, but somehow it is a spider web.

I wonder how many people complaining about this .2% hisec tax hike were also recently saying nullsec should adapt or die
---
who
---
 Mine wasn't blingy. More in the 1b range, but I did get to keep my pod.
---
I see what you mean. But I don't think it would be quite that simple. Hit amount tells you 'how many' but not 'who.' Obviously if you see an anomalous increase then you can assume it's a fleet but otherwise you would need something extra.  
---
I know from tripwire that we can pull 'system changes' from the player so the use of such an intel app could be enforced across a coalition. A simple reference counting approach.
---
1. enter system 'increment expected number hashed to system name'
---
2. leave system 'decrement expected number hashed to system name'
---
Then the scout just has to reference the 'expected hits.' If the number is greater then it can be assumed that at the very least a neutral is in the system. Considering such an app could be used for tracking existing coalition members locations (and movement) I would be surprised if it wasn't already being used.
---
they literally lost 3 systems this weekend riot, stop sperging

I would doctor up a "so that was a fucking lie" meme but :effo
---
Domi is cheap after insurance, id say armour tank would be better tho just like the normal VNI armour fit but with a rep bonus, that way you can have tracking mids

Sorry Fly Reckless with Silicon Buddha was the best Eve podcast.

Didnt do anything but pay you dank bucks in the form of tax, you mean
---
So, you agree his word and TEST's word is worth nothing, glad we can agree on that.
---
I tried fitting it up to take advantage of the rep bonus, but hard to get cap stable and get the same DPS.  Myrm has so many mids, its so tempting to shield fit to save lows for DDA.  Also faster.. going fast enough, the shield buffer should hold with no active boosting.
---
really cool to see the old faces hopefully yall stick around for at least a few months
---
CCP is terrified of removing them because they don't know what will happen when they do.
---
I should clarify: You originally promised that the taxes would stay at or below 0.3% when the keepstar was anchored. Then you signed a profit sharing agreement with Horde and Imperium, which was announced in [this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bjc6t2/peace_in_highsec/)
---
In the comments of that post, you made [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bjc6t2/peace_in_highsec/em70yqg/) reaffirming your commitment to the price ceiling. 
---
If we treat "I gave my word to do [x], I will keep my word" as a promise to do [x], a reasonable interpretation imo, then you did in fact promise to keep the taxes at or below 0.3% AFTER the profit-sharing agreement was signed.
---
A 66% tax increase isn't significant?

---
Your fit isn‚Äôt faster though only plates trimarks and resist rigs reduce speed for amour. 5DDA is almost never worth it, you‚Äôll get much better ticks with the tracking/speed mids esp when trying to kill frigates 
---
If I was to shield fit it I‚Äôd still fit 4 DDAs and would add a omnidirectional tracking enhancer (not as good as tracking computer) to get more tracking

When fighting a war with massive timezone imbalances one must play it slow or overwhelm at key points.
---
We have chosen to slowly chip away at the WinterCo wall.
---
We have taken the Ihubs of 1 Detroid System, 3 Wicked Creek Systems and 2 Scalding pass systems. (there is alot of nominal SP systems that trade, but these were taken directly from Frat). Each system represents a break in the jammer wall and eventually will result in so many breaks that a flood takes place. 
---
We have fed on them continually and we have dropped 7 different fortizars throughout Detroid to increase projection.
---
We have over 100 Astra/Rait within their space as well. 
---
We camp their staging system daily to a degree i would call oppressive.
---
They lose members and allies.
---
Their Recent SOTA announced they would place no new industrial strucutres and that they would begin ratting in the drone regions. Both are important as they point towards fraternity pushing OUT of detroid both literally and passively to their members. 
---
Meanwhile we have mostly cleanup up THEIR projection citadels. We have lost no systems, morale is high and people are seeing slow progress and enjoying themselves.
---
The war continues, and it will continue for many months, but with Fraternity's current plan of a "mighty counter-offensive" they will not succeed and will continue to falter until they trip and fall.

Can you explain that? And how it relates to your stupid post?
---
AFK ratting should not exist. IMO neither should AFK mining but ratting is easier to fix. That said, what are the rails for if you are AFK and why not limit to the DDA to 3 and put something for mobility on there?
---
*Players will agree with you*
---
Lack of local is not the only current difference between NS and WH that would make merging them stupid. If we are going in the wormhole direction, I doubt too many NS players want to be told they get a maximum of 3 caps through a connection and their supers have to go rot in lowsec. Add in the fact that WH PvE is bad at supporting large numbers of people and very quickly you find the person who currently mines a colossal under a super umbrella is stuck mining moons in a wormhole where they can't get backup from outside the system, they can't leave system without scanning a route to empire and if they get caught they get podded to Amarr. If you go the other way, hardknocks to my knowledge still has nullsec renters, nullsec PvE is boring by comparison to high class sites as well as having significantly worse peak isk/h and a lot of people who are wormholers live there because tidi sucks and mass limits are fun.
---
I thought about that when i posted, shouldnt have said afk.  I only have 1 toon.  I dont afk, i am relatively active when i rat, so i have something to do.  Seemed a waste not to put something there since i had the fitting headroom.
---
It was my plan to do so. But fair enough
---
Yeah if your skills aren‚Äôt great it might not be stable idk if you‚Äôre an alpha they don‚Äôt get fuel conservation, you could replace the aux nano pump with a CApacitor control circuit or drop an omni for a cap recharger, make sure you have the cap skill for the reAactive trained too, worst case scenario just use a 1% cap implant for like 1m
---
Actually if you used Denny‚Äôs enduring omnidirectional tracking computer it‚Äôd probably be cap stable

And make sure to use tracking speed scripts I forgot to load the computers

The funny thing is , how fast can you hunt ships when you don't know how many ships are in a system with local. Yeah it will make it more risky for isk making, but it should also be a lot slower for hunting ratters / bots. 
---
If you need to probe, scan every system to know what's there. Also the person farming can just have  cloak alt watching gate for the jump / sounds , cloak themselves and now the system is empty.

Also kill a few rats in every system , leave wreaks. Now the guys hunting waste time in every system seeing who the wreaks are from.

I'm not sure what this will price out to but you're actually missing a low slot. I added the tracking enhancer. I also swapped out the shield extenders for the Azeotropic Restrained, they'll save a little sig radius if you're speed tanking. For me it's stable either way, if you have cap issues but still have the CPU room then use the Enduring AB. Vice-versa stay with the Y-S8 Compact AB.

I don't know whats going on here, but I really don't think CCP is gonna have us pay plex for local. More realistically CCP is gonna have the SCC say "We don't want to deal with fueling the fluid routers in null sec" and then have Upwell step in and say "Hey, we've got this fancy new Observatory structure based on tech from the Jove observatories... you guys should go grab some of those coalesced elements from drifter wormholes... but shooting them might piss off the drifters and they might come shoot at your observatories"
---
The more SP a character has, the less SP you get from injectors. From some CCP article:
---
* 0 to 5 million Skill Points at time of use = 500.000 unallocated Skill Points
---
* 5-50 million Skill Points at time of use = 400.000 unallocated Skill Points
---
* 50-80 million Skill Points at time of use = 300.000 unallocated Skill Points
---
* 80 million or more Skill Points at time of use = 150.000 unallocated Skill Points
---
Where its 1%?
---
Yea dude, afk ratting is AFK. TONS more shit to do if you are actually at the computer. Even, dare I say... doing nullshit pve without a carrier or afk fit drone boat. Fuck, you can use battleships or hacs to do some of them faster and more efficiently. Even salvaging behind a ratting carrier, super or not, is better isk than 'afk meme' shit.  
---
The only reason people AFK rat is because they can set and forget. Similar to Orca mining in high sec. It's isk you make without even LOOKING at your eve client.   
---
I applaud you for paying attention, but paying attention to that drone boat will kill your desire to play this game faster than you can imagine. LOADS more is profitable if you are sitting at your comp :)
---
Occasionally in big fleet fights they sometimes target people alphabetically. So choosing a letter later in the alphabet does have a small advantage in this game. But for small fights not so much.
---
[Meanwhile in Delve](https://gyazo.com/d0d02672a9a9f79c514b94f010183ba6)... Sniggwaffe is recruiting.
---
I think a reinforcement timer is fine, because we want the defenders to have SOME fighting chance. But also make it so there‚Äôs much more vulnerable time than not. A somewhat convoluted but fair system I can think of:
---
A structure has a 6-8 hour window where if it loses all its shield and armor (only allow reinforcement on hull/last layer), it goes reinforced for the whole time. If it is reinforced during this time, once it comes out of reinforcement, it cannot be reinforced again until the next ‚Äúcycle‚Äù. So, an alliance has time to field people even if they‚Äôre US only, for example, and can‚Äôt lose their hub while they‚Äôre sleeping - but if they don‚Äôt defend it the whole day they can lose it. For added bonus, if necessary, make it so it can‚Äôt regenerate shield or armor until the next ‚Äúsafe cycle‚Äù begins, but can‚Äôt be healed while reinforced. Outside of the normal window, allow it a 30 minute reinforcement timer, which can only activate if it has full hull/armor/shield. Long enough to allow people to form a response fleet, but short enough that they can‚Äôt make some big op around it. Allow it to piggyback into the normal invuln time, but make all timers public information (even when it isn‚Äôt reinforced) so an attacker can choose if any given time is a good time to attack easily. 
---
Also, make it so absolutely none of it‚Äôs systems work when reinforced, so local is gone. Make its armor and shield relatively easy for a dread or two to pop in a short amount of time, but give the hull high resists. No damage caps. Most importantly, it needs to be fueled to go reinforced. Maybe make reinforcement take double fuel during that time, and if it runs out while it‚Äôs reinforced, bye bye reinforcement. 
---
Something like that sounds complicated, but at the same time it‚Äôs pretty fair. It allows defenders to actually DEFEND but it also allows attackers to actually be able to take something out, and plan around. Defenders have to be really diligent about keeping it fueled and protected but aren‚Äôt just screwed if someone decides to hot drop titans on it. Because let‚Äôs be honest here. Plenty of big alliances could just hot drop if they really wanted something dead and a properly built cyno ship isn‚Äôt going to be immediately popped. Reinforcement timers basically should be a ‚Äúwe‚Äôre giving you a some prep time so no one can just drop 30 dreads pop it and leave, but you actually have to actively defend it‚Äù
---
Bots...
---
Ha not anymorexD
---
It'd be just another force multiplier that smaller coalitions couldn't match.
---
iirc smalls aren't effected by the amount skill points a character already has
---
And make force recons invisible to it.
---
Small gang pvpers were. We were already.
---
Yes I've mentioned it on an earlier comment. But only the dscan immune recons though
---
They are, since you can freely combine/ split small and large injectors. Everyone would be using smalls if they didn't have the SP penalty. The mini/micro injectors (from the tutorial) have a fixed amount of SP, but are restricted by the total amount of SP of the user
---
they are
---
or else people would always use smalls as opposed to the larges
---
Your comment is irrelevant to the OP,  He is talking about the unallocated sp always saying double what you actually got.
---
I miss flying with y'all in DnG, sorry for being a drug-addled shitstain back in the day.
---
Well, I disagree that its a bug. It warns you that you won't get the full amount, then when you inject, it tells you what you actually got and the full amount of SP in the injector according to how many SP you already had.
---
Even if you inject with no penalty and get 500k sp it will say you get 1mil unallocated sp. It's a fucking bug and you keep missing the point.
---
Sorry, but you are obviously wrong. ;)
---
Seriously. As a returning player of a three year break; thank you for this podcast. My Corp of returning vets just picked up a c3-Ns for this exact type of content. 
---
Is there a reason you guys chose the C2-ns-c5/6 
---
Over the c3-ns? And do you find the mass restrictions on the c2 static to be a bit of an annoyance? The reason we chose the c3 was the 3bill max mass over the 2 bill
---
are you gonna cry?
---
There are only your tears so far.
---
This is my favorite change (see: removing perfect, risk-free intel) since removing the one-party watch list function.
---
As goon you can lead small roams in there but you cant use caps and I think also no 250 man fleets. Sadly the one year im A goon now qfc was pretty dead or at least the inhabitants arent interested in fighting any goon. Maybe out of fear we would go against our own rules.
---
This is my favorite thing since they removed the one-party watch list functionality.
---
no need to get hostile and defensive my dude
---
?
---
No need to really, they'll keep you at a good distance on their own accord, while you die.
---
I do not envy the devs assigned to this task *at all*.
---
Ah yes, so roams should be preceded by a quick coalition-level entosis op.
---
As far as I remember gilas had a very tight fitting room for abyss. What about using some abyssal modules to free up some fitting room + maybe a better cap battery/shield boosting instead of the high grade crystals? I think it could get cheaper than ~8b...
---
Although, for no particular reason, CCP changed its name to Planetary Production since last year's Abyss update.
---
The no point shield dd is really strong and most ppl actually dont warp out
---
Be in a nullsec alliance, that's always the safest way for Rorqs. Additionally, you can make it safer by having cloaky alts on all gates in system to know when hostiles enter system, read any intel channels that you have for possible hostiles in your region.
---
Scan down all signatures in system. If it's a wormhole, roll it. Watch for any new signature that spawn. If a new one spawns, get to safety, scan it down and check if it's a wormhole. Roll it if it is. Your rollers might get killed once in a while, so use cheap ships for that. Spam the dscan button every 3 seconds to get all the non-cloaky, non-dscan immune ships. Dock up if you don't know a ship. Always fit a cyno and make sure you have the skill for the panic button trained to V so that it lasts the longest.
---
After all that, the only thing that can drop you is if someone had a cloaky/dscan immune char already in system, fit with a cyno, but those were always dangerous if you didn't 100% pay attention to local.
---
I think only the nullified scout inties have range advantage. I would see it as that combat ceptors who arent nullified and dont have enhanced range on scrams/point get scram protection to make them useful again.
---
Well you‚Äôre very short sighted aren‚Äôt you.
---
I find it completely justifiable for nullsec to go without local, but if someone owns said space, they can upgrade it to their liking... at a price
---
If a spodbrain thinks they feel more safe keeping local in their mining system, so be it, but the only bigbrain people will put them in pipe systems leading to their mining system. 
---
Again it could be all tied together that the system must be occupied and regularly used (increased sov, military/industry 5) to maintain and upgrade the system to have local. So they run the risk of keeping their local, but also have to maintain high index within a pipe system.
---
Nice  I ran like 100 T5Es and not a single drek or kiki BPC dropped. :( The BPCs that actually matter.
---
Reading must be such a challenge for you :)
---
Take a deep breath. Read what the OP is saying. Then reflect. Hopefully you realize that what you just 'spalined above is irrelevant.
---
That would be strange :D
---
Paying 1% to the Caldari is a lot better then paying any % to a big nullsec coalition in the long run. So yes, Jita 4-4 it is. Also 100% assurance my items will never end up in asset safety.
---
Thank you for sharing.
---
What a sad dark and horrible world you must live in when you choose to be offended by some light humor.
---
ya, wasn't expecting to be insulted for making a mistake. but its ok i dont expect anything intelligent to come from this sub
---
Give me anything up there, and I'm set for life
---
great
---
Who‚Äôs he
---
Granted i haven't given it much thought, and i just woke up... but: 
---
1. Cyno limited by mass and dependent on the ship type that lights it.
---
   1. a Frigate lightning a cyno: Blackops can jump through
---
   2. A cruiser/BC/Battleship: a few carriers, dreads and faxes
---
   3. A carrier/Dread/fax: lighting a cyno supers/titans can jump through
---
2. All cyno's are mass limited, or has a total amount of uses
---
I dont think it makes any sense, that a tool that is so powerful, can be light by the smallest ship classes. If anything there should be an Inherent risk when lighting a cyno, and it should have the potential to cost the aggressor some isk. 
---
No risk, no reward...
---
Yeah, you're absolutely right. I screwed that up. Will edit my post accordingly.
---
Everyone claims to be able to do Abyssals in a cheaper and better fit, faster, and make more isk then each other.  If your in a blingy fit and you share that fit you have heard this before.  But those ships and claims were likely made by someone who has like 20 T5s under their belt and pops strong/ IV drugs and probably has close calls every few sites.  The reason for flying this much bling is simple... its extra "buffer" or insurance for the fuck ups, DCs, and bad 3 spawn sets....
---
I started with a 1.5-2b no implants Gila and got up to about 50 T5 sites, but had quite a few close calls and was running em in 15-18 mins.  Now i run the same passive Gila about 4b ship 1b hull (although every module that can be is abyssal rolled best version so value is hard to say exactly) and i run Gamma, electrical, and exotics all with ease making 300-600m per hour coasting with limited stress (id have a more exact number but i don't care to keep track of a long 50+ run sample size)  Its not that you "must" bling this much to run T5s, is that for the people who do this a lot to pump out isk, the long term investment of a few more bill is worth shaving 3-5 mins off ur times and ensuring that if u have issues you'll be fine.
---
Could you shill fucking harder in these comments? Jesus.
---
&gt;The primary null-sec actors within High-sec (Horde, Imperium, Legacy) have come to an profit sharing agreement that will result in stable and secure markets for the future to come.
---
Uhhh what? Why should an alliance owned asset provide free intel to those who aren‚Äôt friendly? Just make it like structures and make it so it has to be fueled. That way, you can still hit it easily to disable it, while it still costs the alliance resources to maintain it
---
It's ok to admit that you're a clueless krab you know? Own it dude.
---
So, here's the thing about that. That ISK was going to go to Legacy. TEST specifically. You guys acted boisterously on Reddit like it was gonna be some easy win to take over and control the market. You guys failed to live up to both the boasts and the reality of what the kind of warfare was going to be like (100% attrition). Using the rest of Eve as a scapegoat for you breaking your public word because your military analysis of something was way off isn't really anyone elses fault. I'm not sure why you think it's just that the rest of Eve should have pitched in when you guys were so fucking arrogant about winning on top of the ISK goes straight to you.
---
aw man, thats a shame
---
Fashion repeats itself :)
---
About lore: there is a thing call "shattered wh", we do not know what happened in these, but I think we can assume it can happen in other wormholes as well.
---
About balance: if the wormholes go shattered (basically what CCP originally intented them to be), there might be room for some other balance changes around wormholes (like wormholes you can move more than 3 capitals through)
---
Needs a cyno. If you can't see them coming, you don't want to let them kill you without a fight.

The empire build on salty donuts

me and my friends use the dead pos in hs as content. a corp that shoots pos together stays together. i have gone through all moons in 9 systems in our area, and we take 2 pos a weekend for some chill shooting, when there is no other content like not fueled new structures. also you hit a dead pos and its gone, no need to wait for second timer.
---
i will shoot them while they are there, and then i guess we go for the new structure. for now they are a easier choice to shoot.
---
&gt;i dont expect anything intelligent to come from this sub
---
No wonder if you have to explain everything three times and start insutling people before they read what was posted an hour ago.
---
Using PLEX isn‚Äôt an ISK sink though
---
Name checks out.
---
Myrms
---
The thing currently is, combat inties having nothing to go for them. I mean just look at the current price. Absolutely noone wants to use them. So in giving them something unique which can be used offensively as well as defensively could be interesting. They still have some sig bloom even with the 50% reduction but could still be killed by webbing them and it wouldnt make that uch of a change in nullsec, mostly in lowsec.
---
You could also just listen to Spacestation Soma
---
Love me some Soma FM. Drone Zone is my go to
---
Presumably, the new PLEX means they can store highly complex networks of Helium-4 in a smaller space.  
---
There's no reason Helium-4 would be valuable by itself, it's only valuable because it's used to store and communicate data.
---
Panfam, Test, and goons.
---
At first I thought this was some meta meme about blackout. But it's damn fine list.
---
Yes, yes I am, I want my nightlight and a plushy teddy also a nice good night story with a happy ending. Something about krabs and riches please.
---
really chill
---
&gt;when we anchored the TTT i promised they would never go above .3%.
---
&gt;i will keep my word.
---
‚ÄîVily, after the agreement to split control over the tower with Panfam and Goons was reached. 
---
So much for that
---
Please tell me you use t1 laser crystals and sentry drones for dat infinite ammo
---
Now I had to answer this one in particular.
---
 "have someone else make a second rate website"
---
You what my dude, this is my own website that I made myself to write about Eve. Go sit back under your bridge.
---
Great to hear!
---
Both Blood and I joined TKR after they had already moved into a c2/ns so we kinda chose it by default....however I find having a c5/6 static for a bigger chain is pretty dope. We often have more good kspace connections within a few jumps down our chain.
---
The mass isnt a problem at all. Even when we bring out lesh/nestor fleets to try to gank capitals.
---
&gt;  This premise is incorrect.  We've stated repeatedly that we're upset because NPCs ended our wars. 
---
Drifters dont kill citadels,  you didn't have to go home,  you chose to go home and used the drifters as some BS excuse
---

Apply to a corporation like BRAVE Newbies, or Pandemic Horde. You can also look into a low sec pirate corporation tho I can't mame any off the top of my head. Those first 2 you need virtually no skills and they will train you and help guide you and get you right into action

I'm not a big market whale who trades plex and injectors
---
I mean I havent watched it yet, but isnt that the 1000 video on missile mechanics? WOuldnt it be easier to just link to one of the others?
---
Contingency plan when CCP realize citadels was a mistake and remove them :)
---
Ok so if you want to be serous, let me be serious.                 
---
With the introduction of triglavian ships you have a anti capital subcap.          
---
Doing insane DPS as a subcap, armor tanked(small signature) with remote rep bonus.               
---
Above this you have bombers, low skill high dps ships that can be BO bridged and have cloak.           
---
Full fleet of bombers can kill a super or Erebus &lt;5min if there are no fax on field.              
---
Next thing is dreads.            
---
Like those ships are designed to kill supers and titans, while the insurance was nerfed on them - at the same time fax reps got heavily nerfed so big ships will die if they get dread bombed, even under fax reps.          
---
So tools are here, while having more toys is never bad ... issue is not about lack of toys, but fact that people organized them self (and we want this, this is MMO after all).      
---
"But you cannot beat 1000 titans"                     
---
Well yes as server will not survive the fight, but you can trim this 1000 titans, and if goons can rebuild them fast enough depends on one simple thing -&gt; will the rorqual mining get nerfed **OR** buffed and made safer so other groups can catch up with the dread/titan numbers.                   
---
Look at the FRT, they are moving to 3rd position in terms of supercapital power in New Eden.              
---
While there is a lot of questions how much process they automated it is something achievable .... what get us to next element of why **as a CSM member** you need to rethink your position.              
---
Eve is a game. Game that require a lot of work (you cannot name it in any other way).              
---
You cannot punish players for what they achieved if you want to keep them playing this game.                    
---
So what can be done?         
---
1st of all increase the variety of play styles.          
---
There is plenty of regions ... like tell me why we cannot make few of the regions perma cyno jammed without any capital movement possible? (including gating?)          
---
You can quite easily forbid building those in area.                
---
Next thing ... restore the nullsec NPC regions.             
---
Why earlier it was so hard to mine/rat and use capitals?          
---
Because in each region you had some 'pirate' alliance that was constantly hunting in sov around it ... but with all the changes CCP made it is no longer possible to maintain such alliances in NPC areas. Not only there is not enough isk, but also ... like lets be honest ... you don't live in NPC null to mine moons there.              
---
Like WTF CCP.
---
Harvested from the tears of thousands of capsuleers.
---
hey I thot I was dilpo or watever for this?
---
I believe it is sub 4s.
---
I've said multiple times I'd rather they double the yield of a Rorq but gives Excavators fighter controls and require some micro. The issue isnt people with 1-2 Rorqs, it's people with 18.
---
girlfriend asked for me to explain what i do in eve to her tomorrow. this has made me realize how much ive wanted to explain what eve is to someone beyond just ‚Äúoh spaceships mmo‚Äù
---
going to show her a ded site and if there‚Äôs a fleet going out she‚Äôll get to see tonnes of nerds duking it out. 
---
anyone have a powerpoint or anything for explaining eve to someone? i feel like that could be helpful to have some direction with my explanation of what eve is.
---
I dont know. I quit the game.
---
Don't forget, you never know when a cloaky loki will be sat in your site, that is until its too late.
---
for C5 tinker, I usualy spend 35-40minutes for one core carison (250M). it's mean 375-430M/h for the couple of rattle

Why are you salty about playing a sandbox?
---
I wanna see you write an article now
---
I can recommend you those videos that helped me when I started : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF1fWcuXbDA (this is part 1, there are others ! )
---
For pvp, you can join the amarr militia ( faction warfare) and head to the Bleak Lands. 
---
Roaming in nullsec, you need to be carefull: don't warp gate to gate if not alone in system (because warp interdiction bubbles), learn about safespots and gate perch
---
The best way to get into pvp is to buy 10 frigates with fits, go in low sec and lose them
---
adapt or die
---
Assuming the dread is tackled in a PvE site, the defenders can't warp in carriers or faxes because that'll trigger two more escalation waves which will absolutely dumpster any cap on grid.
---
Also I suck at KM whoring (and dodging fighters)
---
~~adapt or die~~ you've gone too far!
---
no, pos' need to f*cking die

You need a newbie corp to show you the ropes.   Eve Uni Also trains newbies.

Nah,I'll just stick to 'beneath the asteroids' on loop
---
Its been toon long since we've had a Father Delve shitpost
---
Bisically what fayral said. c5 chain makes for reliable logistics / c2 is easy and fast to roll for more content. 
---
I actually had a c3-ns that i lived in solo for a while. It was pretty great. I took advantage of any k-space or other wormhole connections that came along but i found if i was ever in deperate need i could usually find another wormhole chain within 1-2 jumps of my null to get to k-space. it was a bit more work but totally doable.
---
Wow, 2 months and that aged well.
---
Okay, so really not that much...
---
I was hoping wormholes were more profitable
---
I‚Äôve gotten good at dealing with those. The targeting delay after decloaking gives you plenty of time to run. Only scary thing is a cloaked bomber.
---
Cheerzo posts on Reddit in 3rd person again!
---
Die a lot in the begging? No clue what game mechanic instantly killed u? ... this is the "right way" of playing EVE.
---
If u are really interested in PVP get the best ship for it: Friendship! (have more friends with u than ur target does ... meaning, get into a corp).
---
My favorite part was the homophobic slurs. Stay classy, /r/eve.

You are missing his point tbh.

Only the true Gods Handiman tho
---
Vily is a joke. After swaggering around on reddit, he barely led any fleets, relied on smaller FCs while smugging about how they were 'burning Horde out', and then made a coward agreement with the enemy and broke his public promise.
---
He could easily have said, "hey, Horde, I know you want 0.5%. I promised 0.3%, so TEST will take 0.1 and you can have 0.2 and we'll call it even, it's 0.05 less than you wanted but I keep my word".
---
Instead Vily went with the greed play. Do not trust this man, or anything he says - the only thing worse than his knowledge of capital warfare and basic game mechanics is his ability to keep his word.
---
The only thing you need is this :  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N07wXQzU\_zw&amp;t=1507s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N07wXQzU_zw&amp;t=1507s)
---
And you can always ask from the capsuleer who killed you. Most of the time they'll give you advise.
---
No I am getting it... He is looking at it from the isk perspective... You don't HAVE to be an isk-billionaire from the get-go to enjoy or progress in eve.
---
If you are looking at the market and getting dejected because your day 1 toon cant afford a marauder, then you're doing it wrong... Imho
---
lol at all these people telling him to join a null bloc to become another faceless drone
---
you do realize the cancer it is to kill a keepstar in hisec ? also , the income from it is peanuts compared to everything else we have going. just saying , don't shoot yourself in the foot for the wrong reasons.
---
Found it, pirate frig. https://zkillboard.com/kill/60227752/
---
You must be in that count then, having only interacted with nullsec players who go to high sec, being in highsec yourself. Just as there are players that don‚Äôt go to nullsec, there are players that never go back to highsec after the initial tutorial and live their own lives in low,null, or wormhole space. Everyone plays the game differently.
---
if you absolutely have to ask such question, then no, its not
---
maybe you should meet more people instead of spinning on reddit
---
I guess as long as caps are obvious target for small gangs ü§ó
---
Never gets old :D
---
I don't have one but you should definitely use this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqoxRcP5kbo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqoxRcP5kbo)!
---
I used to encourage people to join the fun. But I‚Äôm not so sure eve is much fun anymore. A lot of other games have far surpassed it. What it does have going for it is big fleet battles but that‚Äôs now a thing of the past. 
---
Small gang ganking is going to win in the new meta and mining will likely be reduced to high security space only. 
---
But seeing as null sec alliances have promised a war with high security space you‚Äôre not gonna be safe as a new player.
---
Well mining is definitely not the way.
---
Go into low, get killed, talk to the person that killed you. Ask for tips.
---
That's the best way.
---
Yeas, they have met this gang with caps. But what about bombers and tackling a titan? Wasn‚Äôt it part of original plan which didn‚Äôt pan out?
---
Oh hush, "play it slow" more like "try not to overfarm our only content". The last time I saw something like this conflict was when PL farmed Hero.
---
\*COUGH\*
---
Well, I guess you had a good run and it was bound to end eventually. :)
---
Hel fo'sho, 10b ship and you aint gonna need pimp fit
---
1.5b for the pair of ships  
---
MJD fited, relatively safe if not retarded  
---
krab harder than a super  
---
seem fair to me  
---
If you want more isk, you have to take some risk aka dread(s)  
---
alternatively, you can switch for 3 nestors and kill the drifter : mode isk but be hard tacked for at least 30 min (no mjd)
---
Honestly a little annoyed this happened. Not that it really affects me but makes test look bad. How can we be the good guys if we do this
---
Can you link the RSS feed as well?
---
Everyone plays different ways.  I don‚Äôt pay monthly and fly covops frigs only, i pvp in capitals down to frigates and all inbetween.
---
So yes, my views are different than credit card warriors who literally pay for the chance to kill other people and whine for nerfs like this when they don‚Äôt get them easily
---
Anyone who have at least half of brain understands that not all miners are scarred pussies and will continue do their game. And many "foxes", "explorers", "that guys" have their own industrial capabilities with.
---
So the worst, T2 ships will be a bit more rare to see and that's all.
---
And in worth case scenario, T2 gone...Who cares? Anyone who want to play instead of crying will adapt to new meta with T1 ships and fits. Not that epic as before but still working.
---
Here is the thing, once you implement this model in a set region all your members will move there activity to set region and roaming your space outside of set region roaming your space exercise in pointlessness as there is nothing to catch to set up the fight. 
---
Now I'm not blaming PH for adapting to this meta ( honestly all the credit to horde for avoiding it as long as they could ), but yeah it means for those that don't want to do industry to see space that was fun to roam and you could set up fights in going empty in favor of space that is hot drop city, meaning it gives fewer places to go to roam again.
---
You should look through the eyes of a newbro. For many of them even 30 mil comet looks like a wastefully expensive ship lol. Plus the game itself is guiding them to the frig&gt;destroyer&gt;cruiser&gt;bc&gt;bsh paty even though content-wise this path is suboptimal.
---
so what's the deal with you, you're inactive on reddit for months and then go HAM shilling for this highsec keepstar in this thread
---
It's simple economics: If they don't come out of their holes, prices will rise, braver krabs will inevitably develop and proceed to eat their lunch, and New Eden will be better for it.
---
Boycotting as pressure tactic would be only viable if the change had a limited duratio... Oh bollocks.
---
For sure. Let‚Äôs say like 16 years from now?
---
... that makes even less sense.
---
Dotlan data is actually quite unreliable. Go check it out for yourself.
---
In lowsec, cheaper tengus will make more though :/
---
Blaster mwd hull tank for null and rail ab long point for low. Those are the best fits
---
pretty sure they completely removed the tutorial (New player experience) that gave the mini injectors. Which is a shame, I thought the story arc was pretty fun. Perhaps should have kept it as an option. 
---
now the Seekers Investigation gives SP to skills directly, (if you have those skills trained already you get nothing) and a smaller amount of unallocated SP (8k?) at the end.
---
Serious question, why inflation? Do sleepers give isk?
---
hes a 1337 solo/small gang PVPer who feed 50+bn into abyssal
---
and here is the most recent one, 2bn ishtar+no implant

---
POS are far better than citadels. Long live the POS!
---
can't it be both?
---
Join a FW corp
---
who even are you?
---
Fixing bugs isn't fun. New features or death.
---
It's pretty bad.
---
I just got a copy of The Withcher 3. So I'm set.
---
The real special skill usual krabs need to train is the D-Scan. Everyone else should be fine.  
---
Dont know for special demand, depends on how players adapt the blackout. Since 120 goons promised to cancel their 1500 Rorqual alts it coult hit the mineral prices
---
Recon V. Advanced D-scanning V. Buttclench IV.
---
This is why we cant have nice things. People report "bugs" like this. Stop reporting shit and just accept it. Some of us wanna train alts without needing to put twice as much effort in.
---
Salt Collecting V and Advance Salt Collecting IV at least
---
I would say it is more to spite ttt as he is not giving them the isk.
---
Free range eggs vs battery farmed cheaper eggs.
---
I'm happy for you my friend. luckily, we have lots of 
---
differents opportunity to make isk (and generate pvp)  
---
I don't know well LS, but I suppose you talk about DED hunting, so the isk is pretty random imo
---
&gt;it always ends up with me dead, not knowing what I did wrong.
---
This is the very important first step. Next step is actually learning what you did wrong, then putting that knowledge into practice. Best way to do this is to talk to people, message the person that killed you and express your willingness to learn. Ask them what you could have done to avoid the death or perform better during the fight. Ask to see their fit and have them explain it to you. You'll probably get some "fuck off" responses, but many other times you'll probably get a lot of help, and probably even some ISK thrown your way to cover the cost of your loss so you can keep learning because that's the kind of attitude EVE needs more of.
---
IMO first major step in actually learning to win, is knowing what you can win against. You should learn what ships/fits you're likely to have a favored match-up against. This is called knowing your engagement profile. If you're flying a brawling blaster ship, and you see a longer range sniping ship or missile ship, unless you can be sure to start the engagement at 0km, you probably want to avoid that fight, which brings me to the 2nd major point to know. Know how to navigate and avoid ships that are not part of your engagement profile, this is done mainly by using d-scan to gain intel before the hostile ship is on grid with you, but there's a lot more than that. Using map for intel, creating perchs/ping off gates, making insta-dock and undocks, gate crashing, and probably more.
---
Yes it is, you moved a force down to there space where the move set was lose everything or don't fight, and then pretend to be shocked when they don't fight. 
---
if you wanted the fight realistically you should have moved a force down that we engageable this is a lost art these day's but what your opponent will fight should be part of your battle plan if the end goal is getting fights, if the end goal isn't getting fights then sure you did fine but stop whining about not getting fights.
---
The best thing you can do is to make friends. This can be by joining a new player corp and learning from them, or just talking to the people who kill you, may are willing to tell you exactly how and why you died if you ask them. The best path to getting fast fights is faction warfare. Get a bunch of frigates to try, join a side, the go lose them in faction warfare complexes (novice plexes are where you want to start). You can even make ISK doing this, more then enough to fund any number of T1 losses. And you will lose ships. Often to avoidable mistakes or to not knowing how do something, but sometimes the loss in unavoidable. Thinking of your ships as ammunition instead of characters is the best way to go. Some good resources to get you started:  
---
[EVE-Uni Wiki](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page). The closest thing EVE has to a central repository of information.
---
r/evejobs. If you don't want to join a big  newbrow corp, this is a good place to look for recruiting corps.
---

---
[New Eden Report](https://newedenreport.com/). A good site to keep track of what is going on in EVE. Occasionally has useful guides or example vids.

I still use the tag because I love CZ and I effectively ended up as the EIC towards the end. Usually that gets me so much shit here on Reddit.
---
Check out the Closing Time post on the front page of the site if you want to know how things went down.

Mostly there just probing around.

Hey hey hey ... don't say that ... me little pvp-scrub relys on ppl not beeing too focused on pressing their warp-out button :P

---
We have to stop them collecting each of the Infinity Waffles.
---
In the end, the carrier/super capital nerfs, as with the vni/gila/rorq nerfs and local removal revolve around ccp thinking that the best way to make isk is by buying and selling plex.
---
thanks for letting us know from the outside looking in, why we chose to end our wars, i for one was not bored of blowing up NC and would happily have gone on to the next zone and glassed that too.
---
Null sec is space owned by groups, it is very safe if you own that space.
---
If you are looking for solo fun in an amarr ship, look at the Retribution. It is 10-20 days of training but is one of the best solo/small gang ships in the game. Training into this will also allow you to solo t1/2 electrics for isk to replace your ships when you die.
---
As others have said you really do need to join a newbro corp in eve. You have a bunch of options like Brave Newbies and Eve Uni. If you want PvP Pandemic Horde will be a very good fit it is the second largest alliance with PvP being its primary focus.
---
a lazy set up :  
---
- lots of P0-&gt;P2 planets  
---
- you have to extract 2 kinds of P0, make P2 at the same place  
---
- collect and sell P2 once a week. no need to balance your production or to travel between planets.  
---
more serious set up :  
---
- lots of P0-&gt;P1 planets  
---
- some manufacturing planets from P1 to P3 or P4  
---
- need to balance your P0/P1s production  
---
- need to import/export more. may not be a good idea if the POCO tax is high  
---
- better isk, you can do some industry with your production for fore benefits
---
Yeah you may be right. How would we convince newbros to just stick it out in a t1 frig and do fw?
---
Say hi to koffee for me
---
Also tell him he owes me tarkov
---
How to set up PI so that the ISK is good and I don't have to check it very often? Appreciate any advice.
---
1 week earlier reddit: 'fuck nullsec burn haha'
---
today reddit: ' you raised taxes?! reeeeeeeee you're a bad man mr vily!'
---
Tomorrow reddit: ' Mittani made vily do it '
---
Will definitely check it out. Small gang flying is the best :)

---
mhm so highsec dosnt need moongoo or morphite ?
---
have fun using t1 made in highsec only =)
---
last time they tried to remove it i think the station lights went out and no one could figure out what part of the removed code was responsible, thus the change was undone and here we are, or am i mixing something right now... just woke up :x
---
Most of my miners wont go alpha until well after the change, I do plan on trying a few things to adapt and self scouting gates may be one of the things I'll try. Thanks for this
---
ships full of dark eldar are expensive, friend
---
Because a kiki can kill a bs
---
Why are we discussing bringing local back? 
---
Having a local chat means an intel network across multiple regions.
---
Having an intel networks kills the exact kind of content that should be making nullsec dangerous.
---
Fuck local chat.
---
Hilmar was still in his cruiser with mining lasers fitted. That is how out of touch with eve he is.
---
This, by the way, is the real damage CCP's drifter bullshit has done. Putting the three biggest coalitions in the same room and bringing them to the point of collaboration on much of anything, let alone large scale market fuckery, kind of takes the sting out of any hostile relations.
---
No, FW missions.
---
Pretty consistent actually. 400-500m an hour per character.
---
Is this a joke? INIT fucking off doesn't mean Goons were tired. We were burning shit for how many weeks without a good fight, what makes you think we'd just happen to run out of puff that exact weekend?
---
Hotel California
---
And will get killed by 3 mils maulus
---
aim high!
---
Lone newbies get ganked. It's the way of life in EvE.
---
Therefore, join one of the newbie-focussed nullsec corps - I'm biased to Brave, but all of Karmafleet, Pandemic Horde and Brand Newbros do a great job. Regardless of which one you join, if you sign up you will get given a big pile of frigates, a support structure of intel channels and newbie and standing fights to help you find fights.
---
The other option is to sign up in Faction Warfare, but even then - join a corp, and play with people who can help, advise and mentor you.
---
EvE is a terrible solo game.
---
EAT SHIT
---
1. Yes, killing a Keepstar in highsec is cancer, but it can in theory be done (NPC stations can not be destroyed at all)
---
2. Yes, the income is most likely peanuts, still I do not like where those peanuts are going.
---
So congratulations, you are right, but I will still use Jita 4-4
---
EVES DYING REEEEEEE 
---
It isnt just make and account and get into it joining a newbro friendly corp is a good way to start
---
What's the deal with PI? Is it especially good in WH's?
---
Come over to Black Rise so i can pod you and eat YOUR shit from your cold frozen corpse.
---
No they just blued them
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
I'm enjoying this saga, keep us updated!
---
I welcome you to move to wormhole space and leave your static crit. I can even hook you up with a C6 just lemme know when you krab.
---
AF Changes are alright, but combined with the removal of nullification on Combat-ceptors, they removed an entire class of ship from the game, *because why would you not instead just fly an AF?*
---
I expect CCP to know where they are taking this already.       
---
You put some effort into your suggestion, but that ship has sailed.... I hope.
---
just no local is great
---
GSF kill rate is below 1 per month, this means your average member doesn't get a single kill mail per month, your structure isn't set up for members to have good fights it's set up for pve and blob pvp ( your alliance is built around it, and making sure small gang pvp doesn't happen anywhere in jump range ).
---
While I'm perfectly willing to accept there are goons that like small gang pvp given your alliance has a policy of killing it anywhere they can and your membership is support for this structure, if you're hanging out all day with people that dynamite fish and help pay for dynamite for people that are dynamite fishing and then tell me you care about the ecosystem I'm gonna make fun of you. the fact that you are not currently dynamite fishing really doesn't make a great argument if anything you should be most pissed about the dynamite fishing going on because if you're not doing it's your content that get's destroyed by the very model your help finance.
---
Normally I have to gank barges to get this level of highsec salt. Cheers TEST.
---
No group cries like highseccers.
---
The amount of screeching going on about recons being the new meta is beyond me.  People just don't understand how this game works I guess.  You will definitely want a lach for initial tackle, but having a whole fleet of recons is absolutely pointless.  Recons have shit DPS, shit EHP, and shit speed so when the response fleet comes you are going to have real problems trying to hold the grid and actually kill things.
---
YoU'rE wRonG.
---
Cashing out LP is a massive pain in the ass, but yeah, L4s can be burned in a jackdaw with near impunity if you want.
---
The problem is, there‚Äôs two different types of roaming. 
---
There‚Äôs actual roaming looking for a good fight in smaller ships that obviously it would be bad from to hotdrop. These people will probably get plenty of fights with Horde even if they don‚Äôt hit our ratters, because we always have a lot of bored pvp‚Äôers. 
---
Then there are the guys roaming with cloaky/nulli t3s, force recon gangs, hotdropppers, etc. These people aren‚Äôt looking for good fights, just easy kills, and the only counter to them is a cyno with a cap fleet waiting. Obviously these people are usually ready for that and have plans to avoid it or counterdrop, or at least they should. 
---
So what splitting up our space does is deny the second group easy kills. If they‚Äôre going to fly the most hard to catch ships and take as little risk as possible, while killing people who are trying to krab, we‚Äôre going to try to stop them with everything we have. 
---
I suppose if you wanted to hunt VNIs with your 3 man frigate/cruiser gang this will be annoying for you, but most gangs that small are just looking to kill other pvp‚Äôers, not hunt krabs
---
This...
---
We basically ran out of buildings to shoot in Tribute.
---
Nahh, miners are going to just pull the Augmented drones and keep the cyno button warm.
---
Have fun booshing Miner IIs.
---
Are C2 Perimeter Hangars doable in a Confessor?
---
Nobody knew whether drifters would come back to finish off citadels at the time. Are you being intellectually dishonest or are you just dumb?
---
&gt;restructured management
---
&gt;effectively voiding any previous arrangements made with all entities public or private.
---
If you want to void a promise made by Vily you should propably get rid of Vily, yet you let him announce the tax hike.
---
Blue loot is sold to NPC buy orders. It's an ISK faucet
---
Short answer: Yes
---
Long answer: Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
---
Ok now tell me why!
---
They will remove them completely i think due to legacy code... but it would be kinda cool if they could come up with a comparable type Upwell version. But realistically players will just end up having to adapt.
---
TL DR but upvot cause it was probably good
---
Because nullsec needs to be less safe, not more safe. Defenders already get massive supercap advantage, numbers advantage and jump bridges advantage. They don't need any more safe krabbing mechanics.
---
Oh, don't underestimate the krab.
---
I'm unsubbing until this is guaranteed to never repeat.
---
Not really, it's barely more complicated than getting loot out of a wormhole, and much less complicated and annoying that scanning down signatures.
---
Don't let GSOL hear you say that
---
Bring me my brown pants!
---
I mean think outside the box.  You're not constrained to use a local-like thing.  I mean apart from spamming dino ascii art, local isn't really all that useful.  Think about what the goal is: Intel.
---
How about a radar window, with red dots, blue dots and grey dots (standings), in a solar-system style map that you can zoom out to constellation and region.  It'll auto-ping like dscan does.  
---
Allow the state to be shared, also by standings.  So if I detect something in system ABC, it'll appear in everybody else's radar in system ABC.
---
Now, moderate the effective range of shared data using some mechanism.  There are many possibilities and here's one example:  a fuel type (no fuel, limited range ping on the radar, the more fuel you use the greater the radius).  
---
I don't like the idea of adding even more fixed infrastructure for this.  We have enough compulsory random crap in space as it is.
---
I can just imagine that call coming from a cap FC to jump to cyno and wondering if you're about to commit suicide
---
And then here's you contributing nothing usual..
---
Move along pubbie.
---
i highly doubt Hilmar has played eve in the last decade.
---
Oh, sorry about that, totally missed the closing time.
---
It's been nothing but terrible writing for a while so I was giving my portion of shit, because, well, CZ opinion and mine never aligned, not even once. To the point, where I, being full grrrr gons, was less aggressive towards propagoonda than CZ.
---
And now you post the terrible CZ-style writing again, so I totally thought it is "just another CZ thing" and thrown some shit its way out of habit.
---
But yeah, if it's finally dead, then I'm sorry for misunderstanding, and I'm not beating the dead horse. It's YOUR terrible writing now.
---
It is nice to see Smile&amp;Wave still alive! It was nice experience flying with them years ago!
---
yes
---
Kinda feels like this is CCP retaliating after the nullsec blocs went all "we're gonna embargo highsec because you sent drifters at us, we'll show you who's boss in New Eden!"  
---
cue CCP: "Well, we'll just flick this switch here then..."
---
&gt;put some effort into finding their indy ship kills 
---
Such as, for example, reading abstract, imprecise, and delayed data from sources like zkill and dotlan and scanning rapidly and efficiently?
---
There's a blackout, nobody knows!
---
All those cool stories usually involve two GROUPS of players, not two lone wolves. Hint hint?
---
The drifters went away again. 
---
Maybe they are gone for good. Maybe they‚Äôll be back unchanged tomorrow. Maybe they‚Äôll be back in a week but bring caps with them this time. Nobody really knows and speculation is pointless because they have already ignored several basic rules that everything else in the game follows (dscan, damage cap), so it‚Äôs impossible to rule anything out. 
---
But it was never a war. It was an annoyance, and it will hopefully be less terrible when it comes back.
---
they raised the taxes in TTT! THE MONSTERS!
---
With t2 drones and a superfleet ready to jump to your cyno
---
The whole thread is about how wormhole space is the safest place to farm right now, so the entire discussion *should* be about farm holes.
---
The Imperium has fallen right?
---
Lol no, why would you think that was going to happen?
---
Seriously, I am actually curious where you are getting your info
---
Well seems like u have even less power.. Or why dont you anchor your own keepstar?.. You know, be the change u wish to happen..
---
Ships would start flying sideways and local would disappear from nulls... oh wait.
---
Or just make variations to the cyno like 
---
Light cyno - can be fit to Corvettes Frigates/Destroyers, can be used for Titan/Blackops bridging only
---
Heavy Cyno - can be ft to BCs and bigger, used for everything else
---
Or perhaps allow normal caps to jump with the light cyno and supers only through a heavy cyno...
---
Spaghetti code yada yada, won't work anyway...
---
Let's see:
---
* People who use the TTT (people who are ok with the big power blocks)
---
* People who said "adapt or die" recently (people who are *not* ok with the big power blocks)
---
I don't know, but I assume we aren't in the high double-digit area here
---
... Not necessarily? PLEX doesn't come from nowhere, and it always costs more than a subscription.
---
CCP's balance sheet also lists PLEX that hasn't been used as a liability, so in a very real way, that profit is only realized when the PLEX is used.
---
Not to be an ass, but you really should do the bare minimum on research before you stand up and talk like you understand the topic at hand.
---
Ep.3 ty.
---
I mean at this point it's obvious he's trolling.
---
This is a copy / pasted message, but fell free to answer it if you have any questions.
---
First of all, take the time to do the career agent missions. It will show you many things in the game (exploration, mining, industry, hauling, etc).
---
Then, well Eve is a sandbox, so you will need to figure out what you want to do. As a new player, you are not strictly limited, but what ever you do, Eve can be dull and boring, mechanics are complex at first because of the amount of informations you need to learn but once you understand them it's generally a lot easier. What ever you want to do, try to have fun or enjoy the complex interactions mechanics are creating, so basically don't grind isk for the sake of grinding isk.
---
- Want to explore the stars alone ? Buy an exploration frigate, a cloaking device and go around the stars looking for data and relic sties. Maybe join a wormhole corp and enjoy space where frontiers change everyday, and need scanning on a daily basis. There are some newbie friendly wormhole corps that can teach you the way of Bob.
---
- Want to join one of the large nullsec empire ? Join TEST, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet or Brave. They are all well known newbie friendly corporation/alliance and they will give you free ships, a place in fleet, and people are generally willing to teach you. They also offer good opportunities for new players to make isk (exploration and salvaging mainly).
---
- Overwhelmed by large organizations but still want to join an active PvP corp ? Try and look for a small faction warfare corp or alliance, there are plenty of them and they will also guide you, get you a place in fleet and you will enjoy endless content.
---
- Want to settle in a bit more in "security" ? Run some combat mission in HS. But try not to do that, really.
---
- Want to become the space Rockefeller ? Look into market, region trading, and all the shit. You won't blow space ships but if you enjoy raw data, data analysis (like, real data analysis) this is your thing. Isk revenue is potentially infinite.
---
- Want to mine rocks and turn them into modules, ships, ammunition ? Start mining and industry. Pro tip, don't do it alone in HS you don't have a single chance, join Goons (= Karmafleet), nullsec have way more valuable ore and Goons are basically the safest most organized industry in the game. You can also join some renter corp but that's up to you.
---
- Want to build your own corp ? Build it with some friends, maybe to do industry, or PvE, or PvP. My 5 isk : FW is a really good way to make isk and have some fight for new players. Low class WH can also be interesting.
---
A short list of advice :
---
- [This is your bible](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)
---
- Right clic EVERYTHING.
---
- Eve is a sand box, figure out what you want to have fun doing and don't bother what other thinks. There is no right way to play Eve.
---
- Faction do not matter. Pick one you feels seems cool and then ignore it for ever since you can fly any ship of any faction without any difference.
---
- Eve is also a dangerous game. Don't use ships you can't afford to loose. Both players and NPCs can wreck you quite fast, even later in the game when you will fly big expensive ships.
---
- People will kill you. No matter where you are, people can and will kill you, even in high security space. HS is actually the worst place to be, because you think everyone is friendly when it's really not the case. Outside, it's a lot more easier, everyone is your enemy.
---
- The very same people that will kill you can also be the same people that will explain to you why you died if you ask them. People in the game are generally friendly and don't mind teaching new players.
---
- Don't get attached to your ships.
---
- Eve shine when played with other people. Don't be afraid of recruitment policies, knock at the door, join a corp, have fun with others.
---
- Learn of your mistakes, don't get angry. If you died, it's your fault.
---
- r/evenewbies it's a good place to ask stupid question. r/evejobs it's a good place to look for a corp.
---
‚ÄúIt was so much easier to blame it on Them. It was bleakly depressing to think that They were Us. If it was Them, then nothing was anyone's fault. If it was us, what did that make Me? After all, I'm one of Us. I must be. I've certainly never thought of myself as one of Them. No one ever thinks of themselves as one of Them. We're always one of Us. It's Them that do the bad things.‚Äù

\-Terry Pratchett
---
Thank you, I think? That was a remarkably polite what to say my writing is terrible. 
---
If there's anything I can do better then I'm always happy to listen to criticism. Just as long as I don't get "grrr bad writr bad wurds u no gud" :P
---
Adapt or die. Izi.
---
I'm resubbing until this is guaranteed to always repeat.
---
But the value of local to krabs is that they know where hunters are, so whether or not the hunter has access to local or not won‚Äôt change the fact that programs like NEAR2 and Taco will still allow them to krab in relatively safely. If you put an ACL on local, whatever structure it‚Äôs tied to becomes infinitely more valuable, at the cost of a little less intel to hunters.
---
Heck, even have the local structure have a relatively low damage cap, but also low HP, such that hamstringing far away systems from a staging is easy to do with a small fleet, while closer systems need a quick response time in order to save their structure
---
When next keepstars will be anchored? Like around Amarr and other trade hubs?
---
Will the consortium removes the Mogul structures that are contesting consortium authority over higsec trade and production.
---
Let me know when you're resubbed
---
Join a corp like EVE University. They will help you learn and navigate New Eden, after a time I would recommend joining a low sec or wormhole group. In low or wormholes, one extra ship can make a huge difference where as null sec, most fleets are so big you just don't really matter in the grand scheme.
---
This is coming from someone who went straight to null, got bored with all the neighbors being blue and left for low sec and wormholes.
---
Because there is still no replacement for small (faction) POS
---
Cheap, fast to anchor/unanchor, easy to transport.
---
Citadels are far too pricey for such tasks and unwieldy.
---
Mother of god...
---
To add to this, if you have the ability to record your fights, do so. Watch the replay whether you win or lose the fight.

Yeah, the solo curse is actually a thing so it should be a little bit more popular for those people who are going ‚Äúactual‚Äù solo. It‚Äôs cheap to get 700+ Dps tank out of it and the neuting power turns off battleship rafters fast enough. DPS is low obviously but it‚Äôll eventually kill most ratting fits.
---
vily's word is still valued by literally anyone anywhere?
---
I was just looking at their killboard.
---
Their last 24 hours is a Simple Farmers level of 'meh'.
---
True enough, then again I do kinda like the idea of forcing dread bombs to deploy elsewhere in system and then warp in. That opens up the possibility for things like a skilled dictor pilot being able to defensively bubble between the fleet and wherever the cyno is lit to force them to come in at a suboptimal range.
---
Yea but their job is being the bus.  That's all they need to do.
---
i like your second option too, but what if instead of just going to the sun, they landed as if they'd been gtfo'd away from the cyno grid (i.e. at completely random spots in the system)

Fuel cost should increase the lower the sec status goes

Because I don‚Äôt think CCP will actually remove local from Nullsec. I think this is all part of the roadmap to Observatories. So, I am speculating and hoping for the least cancerous way for CCP to implement the Observatories that I expect will be coming. I‚Äôd love to be wrong and have local stay gone.
---
/u/ccp_falcon he is correct.       
---
During this time all endpoints providing those information should return null values.           
---
So not only no public information about :          
---
* ratting        
---
* mining     
---
But also no public information about :              
---
* sov index             
---
* timers              
---
* cynos         
---
* jumps          
---
* ships killed , etc             
---
If you want to test information blackout you cannot do one without other.
---
Good addition.
---
tell me how information showing how many rats were killed within last week, showing exact graph how many killed per hour is abstract?         
---
same for information telling you what is the system index ... or what are exact timers ... even who owns sov in specific system.
---
Like cmon, all info need to go away from dotlan and ingame maps.         
---
No info who owns the sov, no timers, no information about cynos, jumps, pilots in system (aka this is shown on map) , no indexes or sov timers.            
---
Blackout need to apply to all the things if this is meant to have any sense.
---
Have you considered that maybe risk free mining and ratting should be taken to low/highsec and nullsec should become the dangerous wildland with high risk and high reward like it was supposed to be?
---
This is my objection also. This means already well established alliances/corps will be able to easily add another layer of protection against their already entrenched positions.
---
I have another idea... Make these observatories one use items that provide a pulse in system that reveals a quick snapshot of the system population. Add a skill that decreases the granularity of the snapshot as well as higher meta versions of the observatory that also decreased this granularity. At the lowest levels, the observatory merely provides a list of who is in the system. At max level, you can see which celestial object each active pilot is closest too. Mid levels only provide this information for a portion of the systems population. Perhaps at lower levels it might only tell you what planet they're closest to. Or something like that.
---
Each pilot can activate an observatory only once in a certain period of time and one can be used in a given system only once in a certain period of time. Perhaps even a specialized ship that is the only one that can fit them.
---
You could also add structure rigs that can reduce the effectiveness of these observatories to a degree, though not block them completely. These rigs would also detect when one had been used (perhaps not an immediate alert or better rigs provide the answer sooner?). These rigs would require substantial fuel to run full on.
---
Would need something to prevent a Corp/alliance from regularly using one in their own systems to prevent others from using them.

If you had to warp in no one would ever dreadbomb anything ever again. Like ever. The principle of most dread bombs is trying to catch a far more powerful opponent off guard, do 1 or 2 siege cycles, then get out. You're usually already a severe disadvantage in 2 or 3 ways, you can't possibly have practical experience with this if you think they need more.

My personal turnoff is that your writing is more-than-turdperiumnews opinionated and exist within a very narrow bubble of narrative, which, evidently, a very little amount of people share.
---
&gt; So I‚Äôm going to take a hard stance here and say that a potential ‚ÄúLocal Blackout‚Äù is the best news since the glass of prosecco that I just poured.
---
Not just that, but that opinionation and narrative pushing is on the first line, which makes it sound like the most blunt propaganda piece ever written. You basically tell your reader to instantly adopt your point of view, or get out - should it be surprising you got some shit flying your way and people hitting that x right there? It's apparent from the following lines that you didn't even bother to study the controversy of the topic you're writing on, because even your fits are clearly made on a bunch of incorrect assumptions - you didn't bother to think through how those would work in a real no-local situation - I mean, ask someone who's at least some experience with wormholes ganking, and he'll make your mistakes obvious for you - but you didn't.
---
So there you have it. Opinionated piece with no underlying controversy study, showing your narrative down the reader's throat, making false assumptions even out of known data, and building fits based on those wrong assumptions without any attempt to theorycraft how they are going to work in the field.

---
&gt;I see them all over the place, floating offline for no reason.
---
As someone who recently took down a POS to remove war eligibility... the reason you see them floating offline rather than them being in a hangar somewhere is the absolute pain it is to unanchor them. I spent ~4 hours total to remove a POS that was nothing but an unfueled stick with some turrets. Reason? Oh, some turrets had been shot at by something... and you're not allowed to unanchor the turret if it's damaged. And if ANY turret is on? can't unanchor the POS.
---
In the end, is 4-5 hours time worth picking up an old POS that's mostly just scrap metal? Many people decide no, so they hang around.

I'm not a gambling man, but if I were, I'd hazard that this rather clever tax 'hike' is:
---
1. Nothing to do with any cheesy RP spiel about hisec not chipping-in to provide defence in a war they weren't invited to.    
---
2. Precious little to do with any heart-wrung vote to try to preserve lower taxes for beloved hisec traders, but heartbreakingly failing.    
---
3. Quite a bit to do with cashing-in on nullbears rushing to get their phat lootz out of 0.0 before local vanishes and asset safety is threatened and/or gone.    
---
4. Shits and giggles at all the little bitches that are guaranteed to start crying like little girls at the thought of 'losing' isk.    
---
I approve of the move. To me it makes good sense, even if the reasons-given smack of BS.
---
Your ideas get progresively worse somehow.
---
Yep, apologies I didn't link the guide in there but the one chickychak linked is the right one. Since releasing it, I've explored using triple-DDA instead of the C3-X as the C3-X have become very expensive and the DDA fit actually works out about better in EM and explosive sites and slightly worse in thermal and kinetic.
---
The thermal and kinetic sites can benefit from augmented vespas to hit frigs and then swapping to augmented hammerheads for everything else. Every other site type does better with the navies due to the site resistance penalty. I'd say the essential parts of the fit for tier 5 are the Thukker extenders and C-type MWD as they keep your sig nice and low and MWD speed over 2km/s for kiting. X-instinct booster helps with that too but it's hard to see if that makes a real difference.
---
Hardwirings should focus on speed and agility where possible rather than straight damage and shield, and the CA-1 to 4 implants are seriously invaluable if you can splash out on them. Those little bonuses to speed and agility really make a difference when you're orbiting a drifter battleship, and they make fitting much easier. With the extra fittings, you can afford to roll an Abyssal MWD with better signature and speed but poor fittings.
---
Other than that, my advice is to read the part of the guide with tactics on defeating each type of enemy and work your way up slowly from tier 3 to 5 only once you're 100% confident with each spawn in that tier. The margin for error against certain spawns in tier 5 is very narrow but there are virtually no unexpected surprises, once you have the strategy down it's consistent and safe.
---
The main stumbling blocks will be learning to tackle each of the battleship spawns, assessing kill priorities (roughly Scrams &gt; Damaviks &gt; Webs &gt; EWAR &gt; everything else), and manually kiting enemies outside special ability ranges (NPC neuts are now double the range they were when I wrote the guide BTW). But if you start on tier 3 you'll get the flow down easily before heading to higher tiers.
---
That‚Äôs what I said.

How‚Äôd it look to you from inside the keepstar?  Ya know looking out?

This is why unless you're trading high value items quickly you should stick with 4-4, nobody in eve can be trusted, even vily.

I honestly miss the NPE from Ascension. It gave me an idea of what to expect when I first started the game nearly three years ago. The NPE of today isn't as engaging, imo.
---
Maybe it's basics of how to grab a null krab.

But he isn't grabbing any as there'd be none.

Don't be an idiot. Do not give your money to Nullsec cartel. All it does is fuel the inflation. Jita 4-4 is still and will forever be the best trade market in the game.
---
This is getting fixed in the next release. :)
---
Lol, no. Drifter BS were always on d-scan
---
Well moon mining is sucking the "Life Blood" (aka reason for fight) from New Eden ... so it is kind of correct name.         
---
Just FYI excluding the previous technetium lock, goo is still regional.
---
You mean by using either an incredibly fast warping ship, a cloaky ship where you hope they don't see you on d-scan before you get off gate, or a ship that doesn't appear on d-scan in the first place?
---
I think Ashy covered one of those in a post which was dedicated to ****only one of the above****
---
But all the items listed make the nullsec less safe.           
---
1. You cannot locate enemy FC's             
---
2. You don't see people moving fleets by gates             
---
3. You cannot see dreadbomb moving towards you (by tracking cyno path)           
---
4. You cannot observe your defensive timers just by looking on dotlan that is always 100% sure ... and even more see on dotlan if someone is contesting them and you need to dispatch fleet to manage the issue.               
---
Tell me where i am wrong?
---
there still are regional moon goos soooooooo
---
Ya. It a derivation of that strategy. Our goal is to kill frat just like pl killed hero
---
But it is coming from you not me.
---
A lot of people kill them ;)
---
The scope video specifically mentions that the SCC will be providing "limited bandwidth" to all routers in the outer regions of nullsec. Limited != No transmission at all, just LIMITED to some basic information.
---
Offer better guidance then instead of sneering at other peoples suggestions. It may be what they think is best from their experience.
---
sadly, i've had these hawks get alphad more then i would like :( 2200 wrecking shots
---
&gt;tell me how information showing how many rats were killed within last week, showing exact graph how many killed per hour is abstract?
---
Looking at a system and saying "X number of rats killed within this hour time period" doesn't translate directly into "there are X number of people actively ratting currently".
---
I will post it again :            
---
But all the items listed make the nullsec less safe.
---
*   You cannot locate enemy FC's            
---
*   You don't see people moving fleets by gates           
---
*   You cannot see dreadbomb moving towards you (by tracking cyno path)           
---
*    You cannot observe your defensive timers just by looking on dotlan that is always 100% sure ... and even more see on dotlan if someone is contesting them and you need to dispatch fleet to manage the issue.              
---
* You cannot go to some system expecting that you will find only ratters                   
---
* You cannot manage any more vast space just by looking what is happening in some system on local              
---
* You cannot see that there is a gatecamp along the way by checking zkillboard            
---
Blablabla, "you are bad cause you want 100% safety, but somehow when I want to be able to 100% prevent you from lighting a Cyno it's TOTALLY a different thing".

At this point i dont even know if your being a dedicated troll or if youve drowned in the koolaid of local is life
---
No but it is telling you that there are people active every day in this system between 8:00 and 10:00 ... also map is providing information about number of people active in system
---
It's a copypasta methinks
---
thye were already in the same room for almost a decade , wtf are you talking about
---
The thing about this is that in my experience those "close calls" aren't really random chance, they're recurring situations that you can learn to deal with consistently with the same strategy.
---
So for example in a thermal tier 5 -70% resist pocket against a starving leshak pack, my cheaper MWD Gila fit will get below 33% shield and empty on cap ... but I know that isn't a threat, because that pocket is a DPS race I know I will always win before hitting armour. Investing in a more expensive fit might mean I never break 33% shield in that pocket, but that doesn't add any actual extra safety because I was never in any danger as long as I stuck to the strategy.
---
Where the investment would make sense would be some extra damage to speed up the pocket, but for the Gila there's not really much extra damage to be had from ISK investment. Triple imperial DDAs are pretty standard for tier 5s, augmented drones for thermal and kinetic are nice but not very expensive, and there are no crazy implants that can shave minutes off your run time. C3-X for thermal and kinetic would be the biggest investment, and the improvement is fairly marginal.
---
The biggest investment I've made is a CA set and abyssal C-type with some extra speed and lower signature. Will probably re-jig the fit to use the new broken-as-fuck shield slave implants when CCP releases them, but apart from that I can't see much to invest in that will return tangible benefits. Where did you notice the biggest improvement when you started rolling big mods?
---
Well agree with basics.       
---
It can show who owns sov, but how many people are in system and what they are doing, where and how many people traveled, is cynos active ... or what are exact times is no basic information.
---
Good points would make the whole thing even better
---
The End of Time is coming.
---
Sure, I don't say it's makes you suffer, but it is almost as exciting as killing rats - you have little chance of getting something valuable in loot at the most. No fun, no salt. I would not pay any effort hunting a target if I know everyone around is just afking.
---
Having local only available to them allows them to do their current warp off / recall excavators nonsense, while also allowing them to blob/bait hunters with relative ease and be harder to find. It's absurd that you'd think that goons need a buff.
---
You should post this from another account with a WH flair, then everyone will agree that it is a good idea.
---
Gobbins? In the same room as Mittens?
---
wtf are _you_ talking about?
---
Stratios is still going to be a better option for true solo - can Neut, will have better DPS (and a huge drone bay so you can afford to lose some) carries mobile depot, bubbles, etc. and all with a cloak and the ability to scan out DED space pockets. It's the one-stop shop for the discerning soloist who doesn't want to risk lost SP.  It's cheaper too.
---
You're probably right, insofar as CCP probably haven't set aside enough time to code-out the intel sources mentioned above, but I took 'limited' to mean that they weren't shutting it down completely (so that capsuleers wouldn't 'permadeath' when they got podded after the blackout).
---
That's a nice idea for polarization on Wormholes.
---
For sure Nullsec will become more dangerous, especially with the "killmail" delay.        
---
You will not know where and who is having a gatecamp.      
---
Where is some fleet that can kill you.           
---
Total Blackout.

There are many ships that are better for solo killing ratters, though the curse is specifically pointed out because we‚Äôre talking about combat recons and D-Scan immunity. And a solo curse *does* work for that.
---
Uh, no. We have steadfastly avoided such things until very recently.
---
You‚Äôre probably right too
---
He said he lives in wormholes, I seriously doubt he can be out of touch in wormholes.
---
For solo a Loki/Tengu/Legion is objectively better, legit the only recon that will really benefit from this is the Curse since it's already a decent hunting ship, all other recons have garbage DPS/Tank/Speed and should stay where they are good - as support for larger fleets.
---
Dual LSE/LSE + Adaptive cloaky arty loki is gonna be so fun to run.
---
The map is delayed tho, often times i look for something to kill and go for the dots on the map, when i arrive nothing's there. But i do get your point. Maybe increase the delay more instead of removing it?
---
That would be a change of too many variables for CCP to get useful information out of this experiment. I would not be against also removing those stats for another test though, because it sounds nice to have a completely invisible dreadbomb or bomberfleet somewhere that cannot be found even via any map while there would still be indicators such as adms that would allow hunters to find ratters and bots.

there is no streamlined way to start, skill into your favorite destroyer and practice on belt rats in a calm low sec area. Or missions can be okay to get used to your weapon and ammo and ranges.

If you are really new to eve, you might want to learn the basics by running missions in HS up to level 5 missions.

At the same type you will start to learn which weapons to use and what damage types exist and many more resources likes exist on the internet.
---
Oh absolutely, the T3's are going to be stellar. I wrote the article purely on recons and I don't think many people realise how much work it would be to then throw in 4+ more fits for T3s!

An XLASB HAM Loki similar to the Rapier fit can work really well, too. Interceptor + Loki is an excellent way to catch stuff even before the blackout.

With close eyes you can easily know where to go to find targets.

If some group decide to settle somewhere you will need to find them first, know their habits ....

Above that, hunting is not about tying your prey to a stick so it cannot run, but about 'hunting it' aka. looking for it, tracking it ....

I get what your saying but disagree whole sale. I love the amount of data eve has, i love and enjoy eve maps. Losing this information would be a huge loss for me. I think eve us a very data driven game, you should be able to look at the data and be able to get ahead.
---
The removal of local is just allowing for more mistakes to be made, in turn allowing other parties to capitalise on said mistakes. If you remove the tools to capitalise on mistakes, we are back at square one. Only square one feels scary just because we are used to having local.
---
But what can a curse do if the enemy actually fights back or camps you in? Meanwhile a Strat can cloak + outrun most camps and responses and T3Cs can dunk small response fleets/tackle.
---
Nothing lasts forever. 
---
The reality is, even if its .1% lower then jita people that want to max there profit cycle will use it
---
Instead of everyone getting their REEEEEE out on one comment of the whole write up, comprehend the rest of it. He has a point, no point on calling it blackout if map and external game intel tells everything. 
---
Eve would feel so much bigger and vast if it were a true blackout.
---
tbh, I'm more interested in 100mn rlml cloaky legions, you lose some tank compared to the normal fit, but you can hunt stuff pretty well, and with good cap/AB management you should be able to hunt snakes (takes forever to kill them though).
---
Many hunters get kills now. Quit being so bad at it. Why should CCP spoon feed kills to you?
---
Well I suppose I am in support of these changes since I can run my bot easier lmfao
---
is a 5 hour playlist ....too long?
---
can confirm, everyone thinks my ideas are gold .... wait
---
These are the tools we use to hunt btw
---
but ok mr goonswarm
---
It needs to be few hours to have sense, but then we get to another issue that CCP need to store this information to show with the delay ... recode all, quite probably disabling it for this trial run will be the easiest way we can have it.
---
Yep, I've got three or four people in my corp who are addicted to those things and they really do put in work.
---
I completely agree with your statement.
---
Cor some one that claims to lurk here...he doesnt want to read other posts vOv
---
I've never dropped in a group of more than a dozen dreads so for all I know you're right that people would never, ever risk their dreads if they had to do something more than jump, lock and press F1, F2 while spamming their cap booster.
---
in null local need to show number of players in system, not like wh.
---
imagine Stainguy pulling an "I'm rubber, you're glue" on your ass
---
Wtf i hate vily now!!
---
delete local btw
---
Don't run bots ?       
---
Sorry but not all information/ changes need to be around bots.      
---
While bots are ruining the game, players are playing it.      
---
I prefer changes to be good for players rather bad for bots.      
---
While it is selfish ... EVE is meant to be fun for players.
---
Imagine Drone lands after this.        
---
Totally different place.
---
You drop a single super on that gang and they'll fucking eat it alive, massed Lokis with T3C Logi is spooky as shit.
---
Perhaps you feel you have been treated unfairly?
---
If you want to completely remove all map data it's not at all good for players unless you're a braindead krab. Why tf would you think forcing people to blindly gate for hours on end through empty systems with no local and no map data to be a good thing?
---
its already a pita to find content, so i don't agree.
---
One of us! One of us!
---
Im suprised more people dont drop azbels. Its worth it if its gonna be .5%
---
The scary highsec pubbies
---
Out of curiosity, what is it you trade in?    
---
I'm curious also about the line of thinking from people who trade in combat ships, guns and ammo, but don't imagine it's the Null blocks buying the stuff...
---
"Ha! I'm not going to fund your evil enterprise with *my* wallet, Mr Bee. Please buy all my weapons of mass destruction though, and spread your 'evil' empire like wildfire - I need the money."
---
&gt;On one hand, I love the idea of captaining my own spaceship and having a mini star trek experience
---
EVE is nothing like that.
---
What i don't get is ... why spend 6-7b isk on a fit that will at best return 350m isk / h (on average) and who will die just as fast as a poor fit when you disconnect. :(
---
Were you ever?
---
AFK vni is like 20-30m average loot. If you're rich enough to not care then good for you but no kink shaming pls
---
It's the logistics really. And finding out what's selling high with a decent volume. But you make good points. 
---
Why the fuck is your name kristallnachte
---
That's an alliance with 4 bil in losses collectively over all time.  This was over 100 bil in a single night.  That sort of extra carnage made the commute worthwhile.
---
This right here.  I do the exact same. Although I‚Äôm getting more involved in a PI farm simply for fun because it‚Äôs newish to me and a small skill farm to pump more SP into my combat mains.
---
I mean I just had a newborn, I can‚Äôt grind for hours at a time anymore and what little time I have I want to enjoy doing what I want
---
&gt;If this is meant to be shakeup
---
It's meant to be an introductory event for Observatories and you all are acting like tween girls on a Bieber concert
---
It's not about "risking" the dreads, you jump in a dread bomb comfortable with losing everything. The question is how much you're going to kill in return, and every second the target knows whats going on that you're not actively shooting something that figure goes down.
---
What ships or setup would you recommend for 2 or 3 manning a minor conduit, especially as a lot of the reward is in the loot and salvage?
---
Yeah like Fleet Vigil and Navy Maulus are totes ewar frigs man.
---
I've worked for people in real life who were ultimately unable to keep their commitments because they {sold the company, took on new investors who had decision making power, couldn't keep the company open}.
---
But I kept respect for those people because they _acknowledged that they'd failed to keep their word_. "I'm going to keep my word until I give someone else the power to screw you over" is a good way to be clear that you've learned nothing and will screw people over again, albeit in a way that will make you able to claim you're still blameless.
---
End of the day, this is silly spaceship game, and the nullsec blocks want flex their power, bleed people for whatever isk they can take, and make everyone else pay for cheering the drifter menace. But if Vily wants to deny that this is what's happening, it's at least good that nobody seems to believe it.
---
Everyone has given you great advice. The best one is that you need people to teach you on a day to day basis. No guide will give you the "real info" simply because of the sheer amount of things you need to learn in Eve. Try out a group called KINAKKA. They live in Kinakka which is close to the mainhub and these guys are quite active and fun to play with.
---
Your FCS weren't. Same when you moved your coalition from gotg space, I'm sure goons really needed them faction forts!
---
Totally reasonable suggestions, only limited by what I'm sure are significant software development challenges.
---
If CCP decides to escalate the blackout, rather than wind it down, these are all great directions they could go.
---
With GOTG? I just barfed. Would be happy to leave the Imperium and move back to NPC Nullsec, but it‚Äôs not up to me.
---
Yeah. It helps narrow down your search but it is by no means "free intel". You still have to go to the effort of going out there and scouting and dealing with not knowing if the system is actually currently occupied or not.
---
look at this highsec guy acting like he knows about null and then proceeds to be completely incorrect
---
&gt;  when all you had to do to become filthy rich was own a bunch of moons and helicopter dick around all of eve with a giant cap fleet.
---
As someone holding a few R64 moons with a 100-char-corp in a 350-char-alliance while killing NC./PL/DARK. Supers and Titans I can tell you straight away, that YOU are the clueless shittalking koolaid-drinking narrative believer ... lol
---
You missed the point about the entire screen being blank. That's the only true blackout.
---
Faction Warfare?
---
you're not, you are just suggesting things that might make his "elite pvp" more complicated
---
The fun thing is, you don't even need to destroy it, just reinforce it and win the second timer (Keepstar low power, market offline)
---
Confessor can do them yeah. Just shoot first the webbing and energy neutralizing ships and you‚Äôre good.
---
This Livestream is always good for space mood, and the chat is full of lovely people
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNkZsRW7h2c
---
Needs a cyno
---
&gt;*no plesae don't make me have to do more effort like flying around and actual scouting it really takes away from my easy mode pvp*
---
I believe that was a Xenuria post and their ultimate conclusion was that it's not worth the train time.
---
lmao that's all you \~elite pvpers\~ kill, dont even try
---
Try living as a gay person whose sexuality itself is seen as a slur.
---
It removes intel hunters use.     
---
At least lorewise it would make sense. But lore should be built around mechanics, not the other way around, imo.
---
Maybe that's something to look at later. For now let's see what CCP has in mind and go from there.
---
ccp have slow brain, just wait
---
Alright but you're forgetting this is CCP.  Whatever happens will be half-arsed.
---
yeah he's joining goons in a short moment.
---
I am displeased. I opened this thread expecting shitposting.
---
Down you go !
---
You mean the force recons?
---
I haven't used citadel defences, only POS guns, but apparently, yes. If the station owner adds them to their ACL, giving them the rights to control the weapon systems, then yes, a neutral alt is allowed to shoot at the station's war target, as far as I know.
---
They are suicide ganking and don't have zkill set up to automatically pull their activity. They only link their kills so it looks like they hardly ever die.
---
Do warp stabilisers work in canceling warp bubbles or only tackle?
---
Krabs aren't going to unsub.
---
Krabs are going to hug the supercap umbrellas more closely.
---
I think they just don't have their API added, so the losses do not show up on zkill. To answer why it does not show up as gank on zKill, according to Squizz this is the current algorithm: 
---
* The concorded person has to have done some damage (trying to ignore em blasts)
---
* The ganked ship must not have any concord on its own killmail
---
* At least 5 people involved (sorry solo guys - still looking to improve on this)
---
* Worth at least 25m isk (don't want to clutter the list with meaningless value ganks like ibiseseses)
---
The logistics aren't that tough. Right now, at least, you can easily cash out some 6m amarr LP at over 1000isk/lp is a day or two, all in less than the cargo of a blockade runner.
---
It's a thing worth remembering.
---
Yes, I think you're not far off, however...
---
If PLEX is in less demand, the prices drop and less PLEX will be purchased for real money to put on the market.
---
...right?
---
So it'll be cheap for a while, but then it'll level depending on what (non krabs) are willing to pay for a month of Omega.
---
&gt;*For CCP the loss will be minimal, as these people anyway did put no money onto CCPs account, the money CCP received from the people buing this PLEX from them to put them to the market.* 
---
This guy understands supply &amp; demand right here /s
---
Cheaper PLEX =&gt; more skill farms =&gt; more PLEX needed =&gt; PLEX price will rise
---
the idea is cool, but biased towards larger coalitions. Large coalitions have no problems with providing power, fuel, equipment etc - these are the alliance throwing down fortizars in each others areas without too much concerns. But small alliances and coalitions do struggle more; 
---
When local spikes to 1000 people because of an invasion, does the unit just go offline? 
---
Maybe though we could do something where you have to place a unit and it tells you through the UX that there are X people in local, and oyu have to talk to your friends to work out if we're all accounted for (like a Dscan)-  i mean, it would be ... just ... dscan...
---
Ok, So Dscan is the answer? (apart from cloaked campers), but we don't know they're there so we don't worry about them.
---
It's on the market in high sec. Just saying. It's not a need thing.  It's a pve and pvp thing.
---
Congrats on the quick thinking Salamandi, give that man a medal!
---
it seems like a waste,
---
It's called people who just want to pve. They do exist.
---
Ah, the ole hurt myself a lot to hurt my enemy a little. A good plan - always works!
---
Every player goes back to high sec. Show me one of those players you know without a high sec jump clone. You can't.
---
It doesn't seem to expire though - so if you have a parcel in Asset saftey wrap, you can leave it there until you want it.
---
You cant shoot, if you are not at war with the target.
---
Sorry to say that, but you are a koolaid drippin narrative sperg bigmouthing without a clue. I know the people that buy PLEX and put them to the market, I am one of them. And NO, it will NOT affect my habits if I get 4 Bil or 2.5 Bil for my money in the bank.
---
The /s in your post should stand for stupidity ...
---
For me this is the first time I've ever even partially agreed with him. To me these are all fine, perhaps with the exception of who owns a system as the sov map's a very good visual hook for potential new players and that might warrant an exception
---
You will know because you'll have cloaky alts sitting on the gates.  Sadly this is going to be the meta.  Some of them will ping when someone new enters, like those automated intel things do in WH.  Sure it's against game rules but who knows you're using it....
---
It reminds me of when I was in Provibloc and didn't know friend from foe (NRDS).  If I wanted to move my iteron three jumps I'd fire up some alts, sit them looking at the gates and then move it, mid-pointing in each system to cloak up and move the alt through to the next gate.
---
It's a gigantic pain in the arse of course... but apparently that's what people want it to be like.
---
No, that's too safe.
---
Boring, just hammer umbrellas and nerf anom spawn time boom suddenly you get more locust fleets with a chance to have actual subcap fights
---
Delaying killmails would be pretty neat tho tbqh
---
Sorta, like the problem becomes there is very little way for the hostiles to setup the fights, and force a rage undock rather then a slow form, meaning you often end up doing well the slow form making for more mismatched numbers. 
---
The reason you point a VNI with your 3 man gang is to force a undock now or don't undock meaning you get more rage forms and less calculated form ups.
---
I have never and will never stop using Jita 4-4. I'd rather pay double then have any 0.0 blob profit off my activity.
---
0.5% isn't a lot?
---
No need to go mad - I just want people to make effort earning their isk in the first place, and only after that I want them to shoot back. Your billions should cost you real-life time, otherwise they worth nothing, your losses worth nothing and that's it - it breaks game in it's core. Any afk ratting should always be a thing for ccp to figth against
---
That ist the only argument up to now that is serious. Yes you are right, this will be a factor. One of the reasons I hate the SP-trading
---
My bet is they are sitting on the undock of a kickout station and shooting anything that undocks. They will sit on the station cloaked and allowing everyone to come and dock up (most likely to puck up a purchase they just made). When the victim goes to leave he is tackled and blasted.
---
depends what's coming through and how bubbled the grid is. if it's supercaps and they come from every direction and get caught in bubbles on the way in, that could be fucking catastrophic
---
IMO in a blackout system
---
Every statistical data should be set to zero. number of jumps, number of ship/pod/npc kill = 0 for the hourly values (daily and weekly value should be okay though)
---
Every KM should be delayed by at least 1D
---
also same for every bounty (be it NPC or player)
---
and same for locators when they target someone in blackout system (can't see where he is)
---
&gt; Krabs aren't going to unsub.
---
Their salty post spam says otherwise ...
---
The API only gives
---
 \- number of jump for last hour, delayed (cached) 30min avg
---
 \- ship, NPC, pod kills for last hour, delayed (cached) 30min avg
---
And that's all for public data.
---
As everyone loves to say, adapt!
---
Let nullsec burn!
---
&gt; So your angry about the local changes more than the content of post ?
---
Of course! With all other defense layers removed over time (gravimetric sigs got removed for free miner kills, bubbles got effectively removed because it is no longer humanely possible to manage them unless you are a bot, NSA and carrier application nerfs, etc) you are left with two: local and supercap umbrella.
---
Guess what, most of the null doesn't have supercap umbrella, with local as THE ONLY defense left, so local is literally the only lifeline keeping non-supercap-umbrella entities in space. Well, guess not anymore.
---
is Justan Beaver still a thing ?
---
Woah, I wasn't aware that hundreds of thousands of individual players were posting on bad forums to indicate their displeasure!
---
Don't be dumb. You can't take the tiny, tiny slice of the playerbase that posts about a thing to be even remotely indicative of the whole.
---
I can only speak for myself there, but it would not affect my habits if I get 1.5 or 2.5 Bil for 500 PLEX. (I am a PLEX-&gt;Market supplier)
---
Other than locator agents, I agree with this.
---
Well buggers, going to have to find something else to do.
---
Baby steps.  Everybody‚Äôs already panicking enough.
---
OK. Real talk time.
---
Rorq pilots will switch from augmented drones to T2, and keep a warm finger on the cyno button.
---
Supercap ratters will keep a warm finger on the cyno button.
---
There will be single-figure ganks over the first week of people under supercap umbrellas. There will be more ganks outside said umbrellas.
---
Gankers will migrate to the outside of said umbrellas (sorry, Provi).
---
Pilots inside said umbrellas will go 'Actually, it's not that bad'.
---
&gt;*you should sacrifice your irl to generate in game wealth*
---
no thanks
---
On the one hand I agree. But I'm sure part of this change is a test by CCP to see what happens and how it affects the game. If they change a lot of things at once, it will be very difficult to determine which elements of the change are causing user Behavior to shift. By contrast, changing a single chat variable is a lot easier to understand from an outcomes perspective.
---
Also, it seems clear that CCP is rolling out these big shake-up changes in waves. For all we know, some of what you have mentioned here is planned for the next wave. If they do it in waves, instead of all at once, they can probably learn more about what has been achieved and what might need to be stepped back.
---
I don't think you can read, That post was talking about past events not current ones. Like back when you didn't actually mine moons yourself you just turned on the moon drill and printed isk. There was a time when PL/NC owned almost all Technetium moons in eve and fixed prices on t2 stuff. Like back when there was no jump fatigue and if you undocked any cap anywhere in eve you had to worry about a counter drop from the other side of the universe. 
---
good try though. /s
---
Did not know you could unlink your api for it.  I now understand why people say Killboards don‚Äôt matter
---
Well, it looks like we still have null local this morning. Maybe with Tuesday's patch?
---
" Locators agents should not provide any information where is specific character like they do for the WH space. " they don't the message out of their influence now applies to other things as well so this is no longer a default position
---
Yes and they are in goonswarm
---
100% this. I'd suggest joining one of the Militias in Faction Warfare and heading to the Novice and Small sites throughout the faction warzone; these restrict ship types and allow you to get fair(er) ((sometimes)) fights.
---
this rant doesn't save you from the fact your post is retarded
---
so if 0sec ppl dont go to highsec and sell stuff
---
you can run lvl4. missions in t1 ships with t1. modules again
---
thibk befor trolling ;)
---
No, the ole "I said I will never use a highsec tradehub controlled by a big nullsec group". and appearently my idea of "never" is different, but that's already discussed in other comments here.
---
About how much it hurts me or the people running the TTT, I think they care about as much as I do. Nothing has changed for both of us (because I always did stuff in Jita, it's not like something has changed since that Keepstar was put up)
---
If it's so easy rn I kinda wonder why you're so bad at hunting
---
One thing I want to address is a specifically mentioned there are a lot of Starbase sticks lying around unused. The reality is that they are not fun or profitable to destroy, and in many cases their owners may have forgotten they exist. So they are just going to sit there until they are removed from the game because no one can be bothered to take them down, hostile or friendly.
---
Z-S overiew or sarashawa overview? Which one is most up to date? What do you use and why?
---
Hundreds of thousands lmao
---
All their loses have either customs / sentry guns or concord only , so they are ganking in highsec ...
---
No link to zkill so only loss mails show up were real player are on the mail aswell
---
They said we'll be getting 48 hours advance notice so probably not
---
First, you don't have a basic understanding of how PLEX works. If no one is buying it on the market, people will stop buying it from CCP. CCP, from my understanding, does not get access to funds from PLEX until the PLEX is cashed in due to the absurd number of chargebacks that happen. 
---
And lastly, the PLEX market isn't broken, why would it need fixing? In every MMO you get inflation as more people have more funds to attempt to buy limited goods. It's basic economics.
---
Technically I do, but you'll hardly find much on there. I'd love to do the whole Jin'Talks thing like Jin'taan does, but I don't think I have the charisma :)
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgah1YqRXwA Here's an example of my trash videos
---
This guy uploaded recently this video and i learned a lot from it. I usually dont like videos where you have to stop and read but after patch ratting guides are rare and this one is very detailed.
---
You can go even further and not link it in the first place (does not work if your CEO links your corp though). Killboards never mattered
---
Now you'll need to sub accounts for cloaky gate scouts.  And if plex prices fall, who's going to spend $ on plex to sell it on the open market?  I mean if supply also falters somewhat, prices won't change (fewer players, fewer buyers, lower prices + supply constriction, higher prices = no change).  
---
You need to think about this a little harder.
---
All of these things are completely separate systems (lorewise) to local chat. They are also the things that let us find content in the first place. Local is the last thing you use when finding content (i.e. you use the map to find a likely looking system then go there and check dscan / local). Without these you'll basically kill solo / small gang roaming.
---
Understandable but - It is not up to your feelings to dictate what a majority of people find funny.
---
soon, 1% will not be alot either :)
---
that's whats going to happen 1 week of rage then it calm down and back to normal
---
I, too, look at PCU and assume that it is the total number of players of the game.
---
you will use it and you will like it  :D
---
 This guy uploaded recently this video and i learned a lot from it. I  usually dont like videos where you have to stop and read but after patch  ratting guides are rare and this one is very detailed.
---
Anything you can access via the Map you can access outside the client; I don't believe it should be that way. I believe you should be logged into the game and find this information using in-game tools.
---
The only good thing is that bots may die a lot more and those people stop buying PLEX.
---
Everything else doesn't improve the game.
---
The people who exclusively PvP (like you?) don't need PLEX to get their gametime. So in general those people benefit from high prices and while you may not care others might.
---
The people who consume PLEX are your targets / people who provide you the stuff you shoot people with so the ratters / miners and industrialists.
---
These people want PLEX to be as cheap as possible.
---
Lastly we have the new consumers which are SP farmers who'll make sure PLEX stays in line with skill injectors.
---
So as you hopefully can tell from this is that there's a fine line in the middle where everyone is happy. PLEX too cheap and PvP'ers might not feel it's worth buying it, PLEX too expensive and your targets dry up as the people mining / ratting for their accounts don't feel it's worth it.
---
This should also help you see how people consuming PLEX are indirectly putting money in CCPs pocket because if nobody bought PLEX or it drops too low nobody will be buying PLEX either.
---
Awesome! Hopefully it remains then??
---
&gt;Anything you can access via the Map you can access outside the client; 
---
The only thing you can access out of client is what I gave.
---
You say hundreds of thousands as if Eve has a million subscribers.
---
Everyone who uses the TTT is ok with the power blocs?
---
Sure when your argument is weak call names and spin. One always has a choice to keep their word. His word just meant less to him than doing what his goon masters wanted
---
Why do they need to go back to Highsec? 
---
Also, hi. I do not have a highsec jumpclone.  When I find that I need one, I will get one.
---
Underrated and under appreciated comment.
---
Not really. The only way to think this is if one deludes oneself into thinking that krabs are somehow the minority of subscribed players. We all know that is, uh, not the case.
---
Haven't subbed for years and dont intend to play the game but I'm going to resub just 1 account just to show my support #fucklocal
---
Sounds like someone got evicted from their WH
---
judging by the faggots hes replying to ..
---
You mean cloaky alts sitting on gates isn't the meta right now?
---
Negative. Right now the case is that the demand is too high, and the supply is low. Which is why prices are high.
---
okay for the sake of argument, im wrong about whats given via api. the stuff you gave still gives away too much intel outside of the game client.
---
The only downside from delayed/batched killmails I can see is Squizz' server getting some more heat and not being able to immedietly check how much that kill was worth (well, you could copypasta into evepraisal I guess)
---
The only people that can gun a structure are the people with gunning rights on the ACL.
---
I personally produce and sell capital modules.
---
I don't care who buys them. What I'm sure, is that at least some people who are not in a big block buy them.
---
If I could prevent TAPI/goon from buying them I would do it.
---
Really? Where are all these posts? I am seeing a couple like yours, but I've yet to see one of an actual krab that threatens to unsub. Maybe it's your own straw men you are fighting against?
---
Maybe increase the range on jammers to affect additional systems? Have them act like interdiction fields like in other sci-fi stories where Jumping ships get dragged out unexpectedly when their path crosses over said area, and they burn thru the same fuel cost for a 'complete trip'.
---
You don't have to. What you described is an utopia.
---
Stop saying "toon".  It's too close to "toonie" which will lead you to "thanny" and all kinds of other pubbie talk.
---
Please do. We need more free azbel kills.
---
k
---
Nah, they are the most fun area to fly around and look for content.
---
Sounds amazing, I sincerely hope that this is the next step. 
---
Though maybe they can tie that info with some FLEX structure, or even a deployable\\new cap modules?  
---
Informational warfare then would actually become a thing.
---
&gt;Options to make money: SOE arc, missions, exploration, get in a null alliance.
---
And Faction Warfare which allows you to make money while you PvP
---
Well, Pando did call for that MJD 4 times and he also told Salmandi beforehand to be ready.
---
So I'm not sure if there was quick thinking involved at all ... :D
---
I imagine the supply will stay the same with the demand dropping. Is that what you figure as well?
---
I can see you're new to the internet. So here's how this goes: change is unpopular, people shout and cry and scream that they will unsub, then they grumble quietly and maintain their sub and adapt. Or they actually do unsub, for like a week then come back grumbling about how awful the change was.
---
I'd suggest banking up your ISK and fitting yourself a bunch of tech 1 frigates, for Amarr the Tormentor and Punisher are good, and you can find lots of fits on \[zKillboard\]([https://zkillboard.com/ship/591/losses/](https://zkillboard.com/ship/591/losses/)) for either.
---
Next up, head out to the faction warfare zone (\[joining one of the militias\]([https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Faction\_warfare](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Faction_warfare)) is recommended but not required), there will be sites on your overview marked Novice or Small; warp to them and get ready for a fight. These sites restrict ship types, but you'll still be fighting against some much more experienced pilots, so still expect to die a lot.
---
Keep your skills training, especially \[support skills\]([https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Support\_skills](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Support_skills)) (Navigation, Electronics, Engineering, Gunnery, and Armor for Amarr amongst others). A lot of people tend to rush up the Spaceship Command skills but these are what allow you to sit in a ship, not what makes you effective with it. You also may want to look into getting a second account, either for industry or capital ships, depending on your financial situation and how you're enjoying the game.
---
The idea here is a) to learn PvP in a (mostly) small gang environment with ships around your size. The next step is to start making friends and look for a corp (New Eden is a lonely place on your own). For a starting PvPer I'd suggest \[Red\]([https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99000645/](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99000645/)) vs \[Blue\]([https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99000652/](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99000652/)), \[Pandemic Horde\]([https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99005338/](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99005338/)), \[AK.S\]([https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98589057/](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98589057/)) or \[Brave Newbies\]([https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99003214/](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99003214/)); there are other newbie corps but these ones put a lot of focus on PvP and will be able to help you learn that aspect of the game. If you don't like the corp you join, \*\*you can leave\*\*, so don't feel like this is a massive commitment.
---
From here, make friends and try to get involved in things that interest you. Maybe you want to be a scout, or lead fleets, or run combat probes... all of these things will make the game much richer and keep your skills sharper than if you just anchor up (follow the FC) and press F1. Eve is a sandbox, and the sandbox is as fun as you make it.
---
If you outgrow your starter corp and want to do more specialized PvP, you'll want to either look for people in whichever corp you settle in to do it with you, or look for a corp that specializes in the style of play you enjoy... for example, I enjoy finesse flying and high skillcap doctrines, so I joined PL which is well known for innovative doctrines and generally having a high bar for recruitment.
---
With regards to making ISK, there are quite a few options. I'd suggest (and I hate to do this) \[PLEXing your first 2 billion\]([https://secure.eveonline.com/plex/](https://secure.eveonline.com/plex/)) for about $15. This will give you plenty of ISK to fly cheap while training skills to do the more advanced methods of making income like abyssals, incursions, mining, etc. If you can't or absolutely refuse to PLEX your ISK, faction warfare missions are good income and you can rush-train a battleship (ignoring my earlier advice) and do incursions with \[The Ditanian Fleet\]([https://ditanian.com/home](https://ditanian.com/home)) or \[WarpToMe\]([https://wl.warptome.net/fits/](https://wl.warptome.net/fits/)) for about 180 mil an hour.
---
I hope this helps; if not, please reply here with any questions or shoot me an Eve Mail (on Twilight Winter) and I'll try to help more.
---
I think the best part about you is that you truly believe the drivel you spew
---
You are hot to use NSA!
---
Feel free to prove me wrong.
---
Everybody involved needs to be at war. The citadel, the gunner and the target needs to be at war for a gunner to be able to fire citadel weapons in hisec
---
I played 2 years in c5. No thanks, now i ket it to people that loves rolling hole; not for me anymore.
---
Yes.  They should remove them completely and then make an upwell yurt or some other such new-age vegan woke bollocks that replicates the existing scheme (short reinforce timer, shield and/or dock, etc.).
---
Cloaked scouts on gates isnt going to solve any local issues. You could just send your newly rolled alt through the gate, warp to a safe then safelog. Boom, no krabbing in that system anymore
---
So what you want is for WH space to become much safer and add asset safety? Or also remove AS from null?
---
Sure thing m8, I'm fine either way.
---
@14min, you can see it. It's look like a standard fit but with pimp. pretty expansive fit, +1b each with shiny drones.  
---
I suspect some implants and high skills. 2 regulars Nestors are not usualy able to kill the drifter
---
Scared?
---
have a great holiday (‚óï‚Äø‚óï‚úø)   
---
"in the future we wouldn't know you were on vacation, local is gone"
---
sucks to suck at an easy game I suppose
---
Yeahh thats what i figured. I didnt watch the whole video. I am wondering if its quicker to run multiple sites rather than killing the drifter each time. Plus its quite dangerous to anchor a bubble on top of yourself. Im guessing OP has thier own farm hole and closed the holes. I didnt think two nestors was enough to run the sites minus the drifer in the first place
---
I am sure that is just high level RP ....
---
The way of adapting is to spend unreasonably long amounts of time playing the game to find content. Not quitting IRL for a game sorry.
---
TEST does 99% of its shit through alliance contracts. Market pvp isn't really an issue. Only when PGL is being PGL.
---
Who is dictating anything? Some douchebag made a terrible joke, I condemned it. That's not enacting a law against anything. Free speech goes both ways.
---
Name douchebag "jokes", expect social repercussions. That's life
---
I guess, it's a personnal chalenge (I used to try to kill the drifter with only one rattle on sisi, for science...).  Maybe, It can be intresting to kill the drifter to maximise the isk/anoms in yours own hole.
---
The dudes doing the killing are Galmil.
---
There were a few ways to game the system for militia pilots that stops the Faction NPCs from attacking you in high sec.
---
A very basic explaination of a way it used to be done  - 
---
Get a militia alt in a Rattlesnake and put it in a pos.
---
You might have had to pop in and out of the pos shield to draw fresh spawns until the npc 
---
spawn cap is hit. (Was maybe 2011 I was shown this trick in Villore - I do not remember all the details of setting it up)
---
Once you alt draws the Faction NPC spawns to the pos you can then fly around that system safely.
---
I do not know if this still works or if these dudes have come up with a new way of doing it.
---
So is this what happened:
---
1) Test 'lose' a highsec war of attrition to PH. 
---
2) PH gain a % of the broker fee generated by TTT. 
---
3) Test unhappy with the loss of income, pass on the burden to the consumer.
---
This is pretty much what happens whenever taxes on certain items are raised IRL, so why is it suprising for it to happen in eve? Don't get me wrong, as a random plex seller, this will annoy the crap out of me later, but its hardly suprising.
---
The goal is not to test fog of war. The goal is making nullsec riskier.
---
It's not the best money, but it'll allow you to replace your ship at least lol
---
Incorrect, the gunner acquires the engagement rights of the structure when they assume control of it, as well as its engagement restrictions.
---
My time irl is precious to waste it rolling and rolling / finding empty place after empty place. Yeah a place with 3 guys is an empty place.
---
In null you have more content faster. Too few ppl in wh to make it fun.
---
... how are these mutually exclusive?
---
There are other places to get the resources. People were able to buy stuff at reasonable prices years ago, price will adapt, and miners will mine.
---
I'm not really talking about krabbing, which will now be an exercise in waiting for one of 100 dreads or 100 bombers to land.   I'm talking about simply moving about from one system to another without dying.
---
Take a look at "eve is easy" for a breakdown of pvp competencies and a pretty good video on the Executioner class frigate. It's not a bad start.
---
Newbie corps can help you as well, we get exciting fights in Dreddit a lot, and Brand Newbros is our feeder corp if you don't make the reqs for b0rt.
---
Fair enough - I didn't see the terrible joke you are talking about . Just a few funny ones.
---
Can someone explain me how "locator agents" works ?
---
EvE, there is never local in my home
---
wait a moment, i though it was a joke... is it true?
---
I will continue to use jita 4-4 as long as our freight services do and the core export market is better stocked.
---
We're getting a whirlwind of old hands back in Dreddit, too. We gotta have a good ol fashioned subcap punch up soon guys.
---
No you get the kill mail after a delay so you cannot link it any where
---
To be fair, I don't think anyone would consider point 2 and 3 to be changes.
---
You can see on map much more.
---
Yeah that seems almost like when my 5 retris got chased out of Geminate the other night by 300 caracals. Fun.
---
Also inside game client. I won't  tell you how many people are are on local, but i will tell you where some fleet is moving and if they are using cynos along the way ....
---
GET IN.
---
Also remove logfiles for chat channels!
---
Oh god its a sergaljerk flair. Why is it a sergaljerk flair?
---
yeah but he is saying "the amount of free intel given through the API is retarded."
---
the data given through the API is much smaller than the one given ingame.
---
If PLEX is only half as expensive, don't you think people won't spend as much real money to get ISK?
---
Adapt bitches.
---
The right decision for what? Botting and avoiding content?
---
We've blued goons to glass dronelands before.
---
I highly doubt of your ability to judge was is "too much" when you don't even know what is actually available.
---
Looks to me like you want to justify an opinion, that is based on nothing, by making it based on something that you actually made up on the spot.
---
Was grooving to this all night last night.
---
Turn the stainguy down to like, a 3, you're at a OVER NINE THOUSAND
---
I literally said it was my opinion though, it doesn't have to be based on anything other than "I don't like it". Which I don't.
---
HK and Goons should just have an AI tournament to settle that grudge
---
While i totally agree with you - average player is not interested in such informations as they are utilized at FC/corporate/alliance levels.            
---
You cannot hide local while at the same time show number of jumps or people on local just by a map.
---
in-game is fine though since you have to actively read a map.
---
No
---
They provide in K space.     
---
Information what system and if person is docked.          
---
So i can trace some FC leading fleet that i lost track of to see where is he moving.         
---
Same for BO bridger or some titan/super pilot.
---
You are a true aedept of confusius. 
---
Master the mind of your enemy by being impredictable, confusius him by using random strategy.
---
He will soon be searching an explanation where there is none to have !!!
---
Villy " when we anchored the TTT i promised they would never go above .3%.
---
i will keep my word."  
---
whats your word worth now?
---
Ohhh.
---
That might open room for some surprise fits.
---
(Stage 2: You only get the killmail from salvaging the wreck)
---
O3- in Detorid for fites
---
All items listed here apply to it.          
---
Also all those items for same reasons are disabled for WH space.
---
and I literally said you want to \*justify\* that opinion by making it based on something that actually it was not based on.
---
Based on standings you can go to an locator agent, provide him with character name and up to 250k isk and he will tell you where someone is.
---
What part of highsec you in? And what time zone? I know the guys from my Corp would be happy to have you come 1v1 in the ships I‚Äôd advise t1 frigs to start then cruisers as you will get a longer fight in them if it‚Äôs all t1 you won‚Äôt lose much isk and they‚Äôd be happy to point out what you did wrong and explain the ins and outs of small gang pvp
---
Didn't Mittani say something similiar on Discord very recently?
---
This is just an excuse for Vily hate. NC/PL/Goons are the ones who wanted a price increase.
---
im not trying to justify shit. i just dont like that you have too much intel without being in the game client, even if it's less than what I originally though.
---
this isnt some objective fact, it's an opinion based on a subjective matter.
---
how about no
---
Meh you‚Äôll end up a f1 monkey your best to find a proper pvp Centric Corp if your keen on small gang pvp   You will learn more there than as 1 new guy out of thousands
---
Sorry but hunting is not about killing animal closed in a cage.            
---
You need to track someone, know his habits - this is also what makes hunting so fun.
---
Boris! You still in eve?! :O
---
Well then even better - if you don't have Observatory you no one have this information. If you have one ... all people have this information.        
---
Downside of having local is sharing all this information with all the people.
---
Well this is the default state. You need to opt in if you want your kills to be on zkill. They will not be uploaded there by default. One exception to this is that if the victim of your space violencing has opted in, the kill will be posted even if you haven't.
---
You cannot locate people in WH space.
---
why not? those things aren't abused by bots and intel tools to prevent conflict and interaction.
---
Just came back after a four year hiatus. What's a good use for a Machariel these days? It looks like incursions are no longer a big thing, and prices have dropped from ~1 bil to 400 mil.
---
My current plan is to keep it for L4 missions to get my bearings for a bit then maybe take it for a roam in low sec.
---
Moongoo is still heavily regional
---
Yeah man that vily guy is evil.
---
You unlock the Jovian Remnant as a faction to play.
---
No. Most items listed in your post would make null less risky for locals.
---
Good cause im back BB
---
and im wet for the changes.
---
It is happening now, also WH first crit holes ... and you have gates here. You cannot limit access so it much easier.
---
Only tackle because warp bubbles has 99 warp scram strength or something so it's impossible to have enough warp core stabs to evade that. The only thing that can evade bubbles are interceptors that have bubble immunity and t3c that have the subsystem which makes them immune to bubbles
---
I'll warn you all now Episode 3 is mostly a character development trope, with our protagonist, finding love in the arms of a busty tavern girl.
---
Knee jerk reactions are a thing?  What are they gonna do go play wow classic??
---
A sufficient delay might be a compromise, like you suggested.     
---
I was saying, that it makes hunting harder. I think to state just that is objective.      
---
Wether that's a good or bad thing is a matter of opinion. I didn't even say i disagreed with you.
---
Nope, bubbles are only countered by nullified fleet/travel interceptors or T3 cruisers (with the nullification subsystem). Btw, warp stabs don't work for the scripted points of heavy interdictors either.
---
Yes! I'm on same characters, same pretty much everything. :)
---
Pretty sure Tech sources are as region locked as the other 32s. They adjusted the consumption of the other r32s when they added metamaterials to make Tech less of a component bottleneck.
---
Welcome to the null war on high sec!
---
Depends how far back you go.  The good old T2 BPO monopoly was pretty hilarious in places.  For example Cap Recharger II was 15-18m each.  I remember struggling to 70m isk in the bank belt ratting in a retribution in 0.0.  What a grind it was.  I could buy pretty much sod all interesting with that.  Just managed to replace my losses.
---
It's too Evey ü§£
---
First one is better üôÇ
---
Ahh, that makes sense. I couldn't find anything about the strength to be precise apart from this related thing:
---
&gt; Heavy Interdictors may use a Focused Warp Disruption Script or Focused Warp Scrambling Script in their Warp Disruption Field Generator to turn it into a targeted Warp Disruptor/Scrambler with infinite Warp Disruption strength instead.
---
INFINITE STRENGTH!!!!
---
They includes Vily **AND** NC/PL **AND Goons.** Be mad at all three instead of trying to push another evil Vily narrative.
---
Other Theory:  if you buy plex with isk, you are a krab too.
---
Bill stop, we all know that plex prices drop like clockwork when CCP does the big bad hurt to the soulless every-goon. CCP removing local chat in null is like CCP becoming Eve Robin Hood, taking from the vastly wealthy average-goon line member to give to the starving wormholers/lowsecers real players who actually use plex for good and not the evil uses goons do. This is how the price of plex drops, it‚Äôs like hard science, sorry you can‚Äôt see it with your only 300iq brain.
---
Umm, maybe you didn‚Äôt notice the cloaky camper is still there. You just don‚Äôt know it.
---
Exactly.  If CCP adds a citadel replacement, that‚Äôd be cool, but POS‚Äôs are ancient and need to go.
---
I'm confident tuzy and the rest of gsol can handle ii have every confidence that tuzy and gsol could handle it
---
 Can you please share setups for running with 3 frigates?
---
Sorry but you cannot confront safety of WH space with Nullsec after this changes.           
---
WH compared to Null space will be a carebear heaven.          
---
**WH safety:**               
---
&gt;You can close all entrances to your home by criting the WH and keeping eyes (aka ears) on this tiny hole that is left.              
---
No one who was not already in the system can enter and when you kill him he is out of the equation.            
---
Only very limited number of people can enter by each door (aka WH)                   
---
**Nullsec ^(lackof)safety:**            
---
&gt;Your doors are always open. Unlimited persons can enter by it. If you manage to somehow control who is able to enter by this door ...  people that are in the system can make a hole in the roof and make new entrance there (aka cyno).              
---
Without those changes that i am suggesting you can add to this :                   
---
&gt; Other people always know where you are, what you do and when you do it.                      
---
No matter if this is ratting, fleet operation or just sitting AFK in citadel.
---
The promise was made void after the trade war ended. If you care that much you should have helped us fight vov.
---
So you want me to become wormhole space?
---
Does someone have a guide or has ever tried soloing abyssal frigate sites? Either using a solo frig or multiboxing 2-3 frigates. What's the highest level that could be comfortably run?
---
I need to get around to listening to these. :)
---
Unpopular opinion: This poem is about a really deep idea and applying it to video games makes no sense.
---
My favourite too. Watched it many times.
---
They are already healing it - when did you checked PLEX price recently?
---
You guys goin back to Querious? Sweet. It's not too far down the JB line for us to come roam!
---
CCP's marketing posting alts are on a rampage here lately
---
They should just do like the other actual small pvp alliances do and go boot some frat renters out of scalding pass lol
---
Tbh i think they are doing exactly that by nerfing freemoneys from the nullsec. This is going to encourage them to statin highsec for a little longer allowing to learn more small scale activities.
---
TL;DR: Don't make promises you can't keep
---
What is a recommended set up for minor conduits with for two players? Can't get good fits or ship combination considering a lot of income comes from loot/salvage
---
For weak minded people and those who disliked him before hand yeah sure.
---
Capitals cannot be brought into low class WHs, but they can be built in low class WHs with existing citadel manufacturing structures.
---
Want to give them real cost? Make it did you can't use them in a system with citadel, and after you put them when you still cannot anchor citadel. You get Intel or safe places, not both.
---
I fully agree, except the part about removing renting. Your idea only makes it harder and more expensive - not impossible. We also need to keep in mind that CCP may implement "arraythings" right after blackout.
---
This should be interesting. Would the data provided by them be public or private?
---
I mostly hate that all this "change" is nullsec only. Do it new eden wide. No intel in highsec,lowsec aswel.
---
Querious is okay space. Shit rats, but also worse for gankers. Close to a lowsec pipe that you might get to use once or twice. Or is it less camped now?
---
If you get fights, cool.
---
linemember #14734 bragging about the alliances income lmao
---
Not exactly.        
---
Big part of the data you currently see for nullsec was available also for WH space.           
---
At some point CCP came to conclusion that if there is no local in WH space providing other information is just counter productive to whole idea.               
---
Remember that WH space is much different.          
---
Only limited people can enter/exit WH before it collapse - you can also close WH or crit them blocking access to other people.         
---
You cannot light a cyno in WH, well you can but noting can jump to it.            
---
Nullsec will be much more dangerous from WH space .
---
You misspelled airhorns.
---
Seems they could stop the production of them and start a POS buyback in the meantime.
---
Yeah it's all goon pets.
---
What about deaths to rats like drifters? I don‚Äôt remember ever opting in to begin with. Is it because my Corp opted in?
---
Where do you buy your tinfoil? Is it expensive?
---
Honestly they should have just jacked it up even further, the crying can't possibly get much worse.
---
Definitely. The hardest part so far about the single ksec static and s finding a new entrance for recruits or similar situations. 
---
Do you find yourselves rolling into larger wormhole groups with the second high class static?
---
do you have to try hard at being dumb to take my joke post seriously or is it naturally occuring?
---
350M/h is a realy high estimation. it require Magnet
---
its the new double layered edition.
---
In Delve, so probably not (Though according to informed sources their supplies took a big hit lately)
---
Where were all you people when the shit was getting pushed in lmao?
---
Incursions are still a thing (and probably will be until either their payout is heavily nerfed or they're completely removed from the game), but there seems to be fewer incursion sites in hisec that there used to be.
---
They were nerfed not long ago and stopped being used as part as doctrine ships of nullsec alliances, so their price dropped significantly. Alongside that, mineral prices have kind of fallen down with the Rorqual rework and so much ore being mined in general, so the prices of most faction battleships have dropped.
---
Lowsec is much less active outside of currently contested FW systems, so if you roam there you most likely will face gang of cruisers/battlecruisers and very few other battleships. Not gonna lie, this is going to be a hard one, especially solo.
---
I Aav was zygyc
---
Jita 4-4, eating popcorn. Why do you ask?
---
I agree; this would swing power away from the hunter as I would have to actually roam and scout/spai in game instead of zkill and dotlan.
---
You still have huge standing fleets and umbrellas in null, which makes null safer despite what appears on map.
---
Well you didn't care then so why care now?
---
Killboards just give the enemy free intel. You're actually hurting your chances if you link your zKill and use the same ships/fits all the time, because a lot of the roamers you are going to fight will use PLH.
---
Its an interesting idea, but the fuel cost would need to be drastically higher - perhaps 750m-1b ISK per day.
---
I say  this because the relative krab safety it would restore the system to would mean people utilizing the system could easily make well in excess of this back from using the system (but again, Malcanis' Law, in that smaller entities will never see as much benefit from it as bigger entities dogpiling into the system.
---
In the alternative, I would suggest making observatories equal to the old system scan arrays, where powered up, it generates a probing pulse (that also cycles off all cloaks, but they can be re-enabled with normal cooldown) and also pinpoints their signatures for everyone present in the system.
---
It opens counterplay against hostiles who may be prowling and stalking unseen in the system, while also retaining the no-local status currently in play (which to be honest I am really looking forward to).
---
Doesn't mean it's not free intel.
---
I've been told that it's not allowed to make someone bump into the structures by using a drag bubble
---
Having saying that, I've tried to find some official statement about this but i never find anything :D
---
Who said I do?
---
Nope.
---
Sure, lets go pistachio deep.
---
I think alphas can use t1 cloak, which should be sufficient for gate scouting?
---
Without local those things will. I don't think it will be too hard for the botters to develop an OCR to read the map screen, log the pilots in space to a server, and ping if the number goes up beyond known in their locked down bot systems.
---
yeah dude, got for it. My bad.
---
/u/brothabob
---
Uhm step one dont trust goons lol
---
60% of 2019 have passed and we don't have even a fourth of the content used for that epic video. Super/Titan move ops and a few dead keepstars, but that's pretty much it.
---
Let's hope Eve recovers...
---
&gt;  joke post ..... seriously 
---
You make it really hard often to keep this apart ... i guess intentionally
---
&gt;Shit. Rolf in Gone with the Wind was a nazi and we spent most of the movie liking him.
---
Yes, loved that movie, especially the Union troops singing "Edelweiss" as they burned Atlanta.
---
Alphas can't multibox.
---
Hopefully we can fuck with them without having to bash them down, but bashing them in krabbing pockets is Guaranteed Content.
---
Thanks, I've been having trouble finding a group to run incursions with though, TVP which I used to run with seems kind of dead-ish.
---
We should play this game with monitors turned off.
---
I think they are both about the same in terms of updates, but I did have to add the new trang ships with Z-S
---
CCP does get access to those funds, but PLEX is a liability for CCP until it gets converted into game time or otherwise extracted from the game.
---
Also, why the fuck is everyone talking about inflation based on PLEX price alone? ISKs can buy me so much more than they could buy me six years ago, yet somehow in the mind of PLEX buyers its value dropped based on a single fucking item.
---
When ISK can buy you more, it‚Äôs not an inflation. Even if there‚Äôs one thing that became less accessible.
---
So do I.. I just know how much stress the team was under for this last war, poor lads need a breather haha
---
The burden of proof is on you friend. Prove that there are hundreds of thousands of currently subbed players please.
---
Good post stainie. I agree.
---
b/c taking everything said on r/eve seriously and literally is what everyone should do
---
Fuck a stainguy post I have to updoot.
---
you never give any isk to ccp ; npc taxes is isk destruction.
---
This game probably has 60k real people who actively play at best hundreds of thousands is a big stretch
---
For anything besides Plex, injectors and buy orders the higher volume in Jita will probably make up the difference easily.
---
Some groups use 3 specifically fit strats to tackle soups and light a cyno
---
This.  This game doesn't need MORE structures anyway.  Unless the observatory can be destroyed in one sitting then it will change absolutely NOTHING.  Let's see what happens first and then form opinions around it.  At the very least there should be a delay on appearing in local, maybe until gate cloak ends, maybe certain ships like ceptors or cloaky t3s can get a bonus that extends this time.  If these changes are linked to some new structure then they will be pointless.

Join a proper group in null. Pandemic horde accepts everyone right away. If you're patient I'd instead apply for Brand Newbros or Karmafleet (Way more prosperous regions). They have funneled thousands of players through the hard newbie stage so they have a post somewhere that explains literally everything you never even knew you didn't know.
---
Because it was completely passive income.  Log in - empty pos - collect billions - buy plex - plex account - log out.

Now you have to do ‚Äúwork‚Äù to get the goo.  Ewww

please do not wear the cas flair, you'll make them look much better than they actually are
---
3 dreads in C5/C6 gets ‚Äúcrushed‚Äù by 3 rorq‚Äôs on an R64?
---
We didnt surrender to horde. Not sure where you got that idea from. Consistently since the deal we have been killing azbels from competing markets. We just do it via a SIG

Don't flatter yourself no one takes anything you say seriously, ur almost as retarded as querns

And maybe one day wingspan will make a delivery to you :) lol you guys still doing videos?
---
Fact that WH don't have standing fleets is only about people are not organized in this way.               
---
If you have a wormhole that only allow bunch of ships to enter and you can counter them with 10 people ... why do you need standing fleet.
---
I think you're thinking of when they removed the Billboards with ads in space and the undock button vanished?
---
I returned a couple of months ago. Didn't know you still played :(
---
Joined Brave, and am pretty casual now.
---
The problem is your continuous badposting has blurred the line too much for anyone below your 200 iq
---
I guess too many people in Delve would die because Citadels dont let you dock or tether with timers / fighters out ....
---
Hello fellow new player :) 
---
I have researched this and come to the conclusion that in the past, ISK had meaning, because CCP Games (they are the company that make this game!) had not destroyed the economy.
---
Just look at PLEX prices - it used to be that making a billion ISK was a big deal, worth months of subscription. Now 10B is chump change!

Hey,

Alright, we didn't surrender. We just made a deal to end the fighting where one party is paying the other to stop fighting since we didn't want to fight anymore. Clearly not surrender tho. We won even. Totally not koolaid.
---
If you're a director and want to Plex your account, no better way to do it than by owning a moon and wielding the plebs in your fleets to defend it.  Of course you pretend it "all goes into the SRP fund", which it doesn't.  Your taxes do.  Anyway who would turn up to defend a director's personal ISK faucet?  I wouldn't.  He can fuck off with that.  I prefer the Locust Fleet model, with the ordinary members coalescing to hoover up moon mins every now and then.  It's fairer.
---
I'm sure some people are.
---
I left the game for 3 years and only just came back. Krabbing a bit to suit up for my next adventure. Initially I was thinking "okay, I just need to get 8b" and then I just hit 25b isk in hand, way ahead of schedule...and I can't seriously commit for 2 more months to try what I want to do.
---
But I do plan to make a video series out of it.
---
It is more about - fact that you cannot see if someone is in your WH, but you can see how many people is logged in your null system.
---
Get in. New players can do a lot and have a lot of fun. There are low skill investment fleet comps and activities even I still do all the damn time.
---
Ah, good point. Forgot about that part.
---
Is this rule actively enforced, though? I'm mostly thinking about botters - if they're already breaking eula by using bots, what's going to stop them from using virtual machines for scouting for instance?
---
WOW! Why hasn't anyone thought to mention this yet?
---
....
---
No. Why doesn't have huge fleets because you can't cram so many people in a single wormhole, while you can do so in a single titan range.
---
So you make 1 man corps and make all the systems corp HQs. Bam local is back.
---
You get 100m ticks with 3 sebos and ascendancies. For me extra 10m isn't worth the risk
---
This is the right answer
---
Dumbest suggestion since lowsec gate to stain
---
I agree with locator agents. But as long as gates are active, they could log jumps.
---
lol maybe, or most people don't remember listening to it from 2008.
---
Like hiding local, but showing how many people moved by area (and where they went) or showing the number active pilots in space ... on the map?
---
Content, passive income.
---
You seem to think nullsec is an empty void or something. You should consider coming down to Delve sometime. You can buy just about everything you would want from the market, the goo that you use for your T2 mining lasers/guns/components flows like milk from the teats of its several thousand moons and PI, hundreds of fully fit refineries for all your manufacturing needs, rats the size of Titans that will make your wallet bulge, mining anomalies with a Titan's mineral worth waiting to be crushed, ships that you never see in your highsec bubble who then proceed to either blow you up for being a pubbie shitlord or help you blow away your attackers if you are a friend. 
---
Seriously, any established nullsec bloc worth it's salt can have any of it's members be able to live entirely within it's borders confortably, using the resources they provide, and they would never have to step in highsec again as long as they contribute.
---
We're still fighting over them still, though I have a feeling its more about the control of territory more than the moons themselves...
---
Sure, a few bil a moon. But back then it took 1 person, a few minutes  a day to come in and scoop that few bil. 
---
What that lead to was the groups with the biggest force in the region (or multiple pre-fatigue days) could control ALL the good moons. 
---
What you mine in one day with one moon, with a fleet and investments in rorqs could be done by a single person in a blockade runner in an hour or two a week. 
---
There were some times when groups like PL, NCn Goons, etc. would own all of the R64s in many, many regions. 
---
They were such a big part of the income of those major alliances that they even made deals to divide the moons between them, even while they were having major wars with each other. 
---
Passive income was desirable for everyone, and because it was possible to claim moons anywhere in the cluster, it also was a good way to provoke fights that you could win. 
---
Supers didn't drop for everything, and during the Fatigue days even capitals wouldn't always been in range. You'd get Subcap fleets coming through wormholes and local groups that were paid by either side for some fun mid-scale content that would give the victor a satisfying win by immediately stripping your opponent of a valuable asset that they would then have to fight you for. 
---
Oh, and it'd didn't take a fucking week to flip the moon, plus another week to pull a big fucking rock into space before you made money off it. As soon as the POS is dead, you drop yours, then as soon as the harvester is online, money is being made.
---
I agree, but it is probably better to do it in steps rather than all at once to gauge the communities reactions.
---
Yes. A director in your corporation has opted in on zkill.
---
What delay have to do with ability to gather this data.      
---
So what will change if i cannot see if something is happening in a system in last hour, when this was happening in this system for last week at this specific time?
---
Thats a no from me dog.
---
plz link the killmail
---
It is to easy to track fleet movements this way or gatecamps.
---
Don't fight worms. Period. God those things are aids.
---
Oh no, can't do this, think of the hunters! How ever will they find content now?
---
You're already outside of the "can I be bothered to do it" envelope for most people.  I'm sure there are a few people with Xeons (Zen 2 now, surely?), lots of VMs, etc. running multiple alphas.  They are outliers (in so many ways) who's mothers no doubt had them tested.
---
I miss when I could buy 4-5 subs for the same amount of ISK I now use to sub 1.
---
CCP's drifter bullshit in that started a week ago caused a peace treaty 2 months ago?
---
You cannot say A without B.       
---
K space have gates and cynos, WH space have holes with limited mass.            
---
K space have massive population, WH space have minimal.         
---
How you can even compare one to another is beyond me.
---
That and they are expensive.
---
Not that that matters much anymore, but I‚Äôm cheap.
---
More isk for everyone by not wasting time fighting in highsec and you guys got to go back to null like everyone on bith sides wanted. Failing to see any loss there.
---
welcome to the game buddy!
---
In the past these higher end moons and reaction farms were used to supply alliances with an income so they could provide services to their memebers like SRP and infrastructure. 
---
hope this helps and fly dangerous o7
---
Or rather, local comes back randomly as if to simulate the normal conditions we have been experiencing in the past year or so.
---
Redditboy, YOU MY BOY!!!
---
Looks like a Nestor precursor :-p
---
not often did i read a worse idea. imagine singleboxing links...
---
Hey the vexor still had mining drone bonus. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
They can also shoot back without anyone manning the station.  Can also out DPS citadels.
---
So you want free Intel but also think it's bad for people who live in the space to not get free Intel?
---
I support the full Blackout. Think of it. Set up a Base in nowhere and nobody notices.
---
Way to add exactly nothing to the conversation.
---
Well done.
---
So you think hunters should be given free Intel in the forms listed above but local free Intel is to much?
---
Now if only something could be done about capital jump range...
---
Nah who am I kidding, just nerf caps again and make trig ships even better.
---
well fly one to blind
---
Gate logs is the lore reason for local as well so they should be connected.
---
Capital Gravity Capacitor II babyyyy
---
So, you want the guy providing links to have to be behind or in front of the fleet so he can hopefully get everyone? Just out there by himself asking to be shot?  
---
Also, if combat right now doesn't feel very spatial... might I recommend a role other than anchoring on the FC and shooting the called target?
---
He never used the vexor, think it was a thorax.
---
Wouldn't removing this info make null more dangerous for both as whalers need to figure out where the krabs are, instead of just checking where the numbers tell you to go?
---
Eve holer btw

Plex will drop in price. Then stabilise back again.  But CCP will recieve less money as less volumes of plex are traded
---
We will find your AT ships, and borrow them, and feed them.. there is no where to hide.
---
In pos times best ratting ship was is carrier with 100mil/hour, not a supercarrier with 300 now.
---
No, it just means you don‚Äôt understand poetry in context.
---
But you shouldn‚Äôt feel bad about that, most people don‚Äôt.
---
Why give Hunters Intel and Preys not? Let everyone work for your Intel.
---
&gt; So, you want the guy providing links to have to be behind or in front of the fleet so he can hopefully get everyone?
---
No. The command burst still affects everyone it would have affected currently (everyone in an x km sphere). That doesn't change. The only change is that the links only provide protection if the damage is coming from (roughly) the designated direction.
---
The guy providing links be exactly where he is now. All he has to do is point the links at the enemy fleet.
---
A magnificent poem set in an awesome universe.
---
If you just want to PvE, then why are you so concerned about the machinations of Ece-politics?
---
Yes give goons panfam and legacy total monopoly over null sec. That's wise
---
Implying that EVE isn't a thinking man's game and that the idea of trans humanism and the human condition in the lens of science fiction isn't a deep subject.
---
also hardly anyone ratted in carriers because you had to sit at 0 m/s on your sentry drones. plus they took a long time to train into.
---
Jump counts are definitely connected to local lore wise. You are implying people who hunt should have access to free Intel(with the exception of locator agents) and the people who live in that space should not get free Intel?
---
I'll take "how to make links unusable for nano and small gang pvp" for $200.
---
this game need something to change with cyno's and inhibitors, to cut capitals from subcap's fight.
---
Wow How'd they mess up the isk so much
---
Meh, I trade in Amarr where the dank blue loot can be sold right in station.  I'll let you clowns all cry about some strange place called "Perimeter."
---
Still waiting on my trig dread
---
Sure. https://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/eve-online/281488/eve-online-review
---
CCP claims that there are hundreds of thousands of players. Sure, they could be lying, but they are the authority on Eve's subscriber base.
---
I thought it was to stop giving people free information, now you tell me the people hunting are hypocrites and only want free info that makes their game play easier?
---
Those APIs do not update on tick, local does.
---
We had 100% of the TTT income. Now we don't.
---
 But sure, it's no skin off my back if we decide that TEST didn't sue for peace and paid for the privilege since I went on those Perimeter fleets and fought for the TTT to stand triumphant as well. Who doesn't want to paint themselves the winner?
---
Tell that to CCP.
---
Can you give a link to the mining ledgers where people dought for that isk? Struggling to find one
---
A gate is a giant stable wormhole.
---
Send 'Covert0ne' an EVE mail, few of the boys still play! :)
---
It doesn't give you extra sp. It just says it's going to.
---
Right but we made more isk after the deal than when we had 100%. Which is what a lot of folks havent noticed.
---
All good, you died with honor. Also thx for the video, was fun to watch.
---
You are not talking about links, you are talking about an actual shielding mechanic. CCP did actually show concept art for them at some fanfest, but nothing ever came after that.
---
I don't even know if the current EVE game engine supports "damage coming from that direction" (I highly doubt it)
---
So proud to be in init. So many people want free roq kills, they dont know the real fun is brawling the umbrella in t1 subs.
---
The cycle time of command bursts is a full minute. Each command ship can have 2. Ask a Starcraft player what they think of your 2 APM...
---
They kill citadels, it's just uncommon.
---
What's "krabbing" in Eve jargon?
---
Hi Falcon. What kind of games do you like? Strategy? Shooter? Swordfighting? Nancy Drew?
---
shit i have to redo all our triple link fits now. only 2 alloweed
---
Salvaging the blackbox from the ship for information on how it met its fate would be a super interesting mechanic. Maybe you have to take the blackbox to a station with salvaging services.
---
Good for us, I guess.
---
That's none of your business.
---
Hello fellow new player (I just installed the game last week!). My corporation team-mates have also told me of old times where there were only a few stations throughout null security regions. They also mentioned something like "blopsing rusrus" but I dont know what that means. Maybe someone can clear it up for me - what do few stations have in common with "blopsing rusrus"? 
---
They also mentioned something about no tether and "station games" but all that's jibberish to me. I'm just super happy I was able to catch up to the older veterans in my corporation and now fly a carrier.
---
Will do, thanks :D
---
My time isn't free. How much are you paying?
---
Imagine being this butthurt that a girl is writing about a video game
---
Jump count is stargate activations, if it tracked local going up and down it'd be tracking people logging in and out, wormhole activations and all sorts. The people who live in space also have all sorts of other advantages like private jump gates (lol ccp), intel bots and capitals etc. It'll also be possible for defenders to know exactly how many roamers are in their systems by keeping eyes on gates, something the attackers will pretty much never know.
---
I'm thinking you are holding into the notion of broadsides in space and eve moves too fast for that.
---
Low sec people fought just to fight. The largest fights between Snuff Box and Shadow Cartel were over Cadmium moons. These netted MAYBE 1b a month back in 2012-2014. The moons were just a means to an end, and the end we wanted was a brawl of Faction BS, T3s and capitals. 
---
Cadmium moon - https://zkillboard.com/related/30045313/201506131900/
---
Cadmium moon - https://zkillboard.com/related/30003788/201503082200/
---
Low sec was never about the money. The best money in the game was always high sec, null sec or WHs. It was about the fights. I think that's still true, but I don't play anymore.
---
You can see active pockets/systems without knowing when exactly to expect targets?
---
Frankly the problem is not that those people threaten to unsub or quit. The bigger problem is those people will buy up as much plex as possible to sit on it as a future investment. I cant remember when they last did it but according to CCP only like 30# of plex are actually redeemed for something. The other 70% people sit on as an investment.
---
So rat kills, jumps, avrage pilots won't be tracked in blackout right?
---
Blah blah blah, they have too many friends, blah blah blah, yes my flair is Imperium but it's only bad when somebody else does it, blah blah blah here's a corp nobody has heard of as proof.
---
Yes, and if they remained sole o&amp;o your argument would be valid. But, having ceded control over the TTT to other alliances to run on a vote-based system, Vily ceded sole determination over TTT. No promises were made by the other owners.   Because majority rules and because the majority voted to raise taxes, Vily is indemnified from liability,  especially if TEST voted against the increase.  The guilt lies with us Goon and the other stakeholders.
---
Low sec alliances didn't fight over cadmium moons and POCOs because of isk...
---
I think it's a bit unfair to state CCP wrecked the economy when it's largely down to the players creating safe areas and optimizing + multiboxing the hell out of any possible gains.
---
People are still going to run 10/10s, Abyssals in their nullsec staging or backwaters, and subcab krabs will migrate from the AFK VNI to the AFK Myrmidon or Dominix or Armageddon. 
---
Rorq pilots switch over to T2 drones and the velocity of mineral creation will decrease, leading to an eventual higher value of minerals/ships. 
---
Supercap ratters will continue doing what they do now, nothing is going to change for them drastically
---
As a ganker, I'm going to continue to farm in Delve and Esoteria, and now I might even have a chance at catching Period Basis and Paragon Soul bots. Why move to Provi/Detorid/Dronelands/The North and shoot maybe 20-30 targets at any given hour when I can remain where I am and continue shooting 200-300 targets at any given hour?
---
We should remove overviews and brackets too.
---
Wait, has inflation done this or was it some direct manipulation by CCP? I've not played in over a year now.
---
\^ this.
---
lol Rorqs totally destroyed the economy, because it turns out CCP did need a actual phd of economics to realize that drastically increasing the amount of minerals players could mine would tank the economy
---
One could also assign some blame to Vily for making a promise that he was in no position to keep. If I say my company will never outsource jobs, but then the shareholders demand I do so, I think you could blame me for making a promise I couldn't possibly keep.
---
So that article casually mentions ‚Äúhundreds of thousands of players‚Äù playing on the same shard but has zero evidence that I could see that the author did anything but assign that number himself. Maybe I missed it in there though.
---
You made my point exactly. You can't sell it without the people in high sec. Think before posting something stupid.
---
tf u on about?
---
it doesn't take a genius to deduce that allowing players to mine more by like 5 - 10x as much as before, and increasing ratting income from &lt;100/hr to 300 - 400/hr would cause players to rat and mine more
---
grinding PVE for money
---
To be fair. The elite PvPers wont be affected in High-sec
---
I live in null. But I won't sit and pretend that high sec is a joke and they don't help support and work with null. You on the other hand think there's zero connection. And that's naive.
---
Now you have to be the miner.
---
sure but only if I can fly backwards
---
PLEX sales would be considered deferred revenue - sales of services not yet provided. It‚Äôs not that they don‚Äôt get access to the money, and there probably isn‚Äôt an issue with chargebacks. But it‚Äôs a liability that isn‚Äôt counted as revenue until the PLEX is actually spent.
---
Didn't say me personally. I do everything and if you think null people don't pve you're naive.
---
Sort of missed what's been happening in eve is it permanent or just part of an event?
---
You need to look at the context, local chat is perfect free intel that krabs use on top of their umbrellas, intel networks and vast numbers to dock up safely. Map data is the only method (besides set desto bwf) that roamers use to determine where to roam to.
---
So next week we'll hate CCP right? Because this sub as a hive mind has some massive mood swings.
---
And local count is based on gate beacons, how about have local show based on those? Additionally with Covert cynos and wormholes there are ways to get people into the system without people knowing.
---
you dont get it 
---
we both need each other...
---
You do know Bill singlehandedly brought GOTG to their knees with his hunting last year, right?
---
I don't see why any of these things are needed.  Local being black outed is plenty valuable.
---
A server restart?
---
It's safe to say that there's a very noisy vocal minority to our sub that drowns out the thousands of people that don't care or don't post.
---
thank you, yeah definitely was planning on showering ‚Äúthis is eve‚Äù
---
You can put 8 high slots full of links for all I care, this change would only affect 2 of the link types: armor and shield resistance links. In in-game terms, command bursts with Armor Energizing Charge and Shield Harmonizing Charge. The other links are unaffected.
---
Idk man, I didn't think it was that funny.
---
Though I'm guessing a lot of people here don't really like you and are perfectly willing to accept an interpretation that makes you look bad (whether you meant it or not)
---
I think that would kill the game. But perhaps collapsing space a few regions to increase density.
---
1. Skill injectors that made it much easier for any player to skill into a Supercarrier.
---
2. Supercarrier/Carrier changes that allowed for them to rat aligned, while pulling higher ISK/hr than the sentry version.
---
3. Rorquals, which do not directly make ISK, but sort of do because of insurance framing T1 BS with your minerals being a viable way to clear large stacks.
---
4. Boson Ratting Titans, which previously didn't exist at all.
---
5. Social Boosters, which allowed players to do only the best of the best Level V missions.
---
You mean blanket afk cloaky camping a region? Glad we're in agreement that the barrier to entry for pvp should be 50 accounts and a dedicated camping server!
---
How will the defend them from the three biggest blobs?
---
I've never ran with TVP, but you can join the "Warp To Me Incursions" in-game channel to join the Warp To Me group, they're still fairly active.
---
Skill farmers burn through far more Plex than anom farmers
---
if he can find any.
---
You want people in space. Free intel is free intel. You can't say on one hand remove local because it is free intel and on the other hand keep the free intel that is handed out via an esi endpoint or ingame tools  because they make it dangerous. Those tools just make people lazy and only go to places they see activity. We need people in space all over soi g things that used to be do e by people but is now spoonfed to us by CCP to make thi gs easier.
---
My flair is a meme, and I'm sorry that you only know of the largest corps. 
---
It's a smaller corp that wanted to pvp more. I know you don't have those in TEST, so it's an odd concept.
---
lol the same 20-30 people who consistently downvote my shit and follow me around on reddit like tweakers migrating towards the next meth drop does not account for a lot of people
---
POS are very good additionally for super ratting systems. If you have fighters deployed and you warp to an upwell you cannot tether and are vulnerable. However warping to a POS makes your fighters auto recall when you land and you have the safety of the shield. You always risk being bubble intercepted warping to a POS like you can to an upwell. Additionally you have less risk to be bumped out of a shield vs on an upwell structure (provided you warp to a BM that was placed outside of hitting anything inside the POS).
---
u r a moron.. the game is already boring
---
As someone who just comes to highsec for the odd ship now and again. Ive just always used jita. I never noticed this TTT till this post.
---
Am I missing out or is it just no difference.
---
It's the new "PC" term for "jewing".
---
Essentially focussing on making money. Not sure exactly the source, but I think there is a renter alliance that has a crab holding money as it's logo. But I think that came after the popularization of the term in this context.
---
Like right now, I'm not pvping (by choice anyway). Just making isk. Some PVP finds me, and I greet it with much panic as I get readjusted to the EVE shakes and the cognitive difficulties of triple boxing (burnt out the guns on 2 of my tengus trying to save another tengu, luckily the attacker left after killing the one just as they both burnt out. I was so busy watching for a gang coming in and keeping my tengus out of range so that he couldn't just get them all that I totally missed how much heat damage they had.)
---
Anyway, hopefully this will get me ready for my adventure, like I said. I want to nomad through wormholes with an orca and my alts. Making some money, killing some people (something I can now be riskier with considering I krabbed better than expected).
---
So hopefully, the video series will be interesting about this unique playstyle. I plan to just record EVERYTHING for a few months, keeping track of important events, and then edit it into a series, essentially planning all the events into a proper episodic tale.
---
At the time, he was in a position to keep it. The joint-ownership agreement came AFTER the promise was made.  Vily, being human, was unable to devine the future did not know his promise would be unkeepable when he made it. Vily 8 months ago did not know or suspect that ownership would become joint.  At the time,TEST owned the TTT solely, and he was well within his authority to make such promises in good faith. 
---
When Vily made the joint agreement,  he again did not know this would result in an increase.    That has only come up recently after a meet and vote.  The future is unknowable.  You can argue he suspected, and he may have.  But, only way to know for sure is for the future to become the past.  If Vily had broken the promise back at the joint ownership agreement,  people would have been upset at a decision based on at-the-time supposition.  But, after the agreement he would have made a unilateral release without approval of the joint-owners; a violation of the agreement.
---
Confirmed. Traitorous Dino idiots.

literally no one is sperging... like where is this sperging? I'm still trying to find all these sperg posts that you guys are blowing loads over and... I think... they might be a figment of your imagination?
---
Yeah, people have gotten around that easily.
---
what if you had to manually aim reddit posts?
---
Is anyone in this game?
---
don't need to imagine, just look at the imperium or legacy
---
Moongoo is already region locked. You cannot build T2 items without moongoo from all quadrants of the game. I'm not sure why folks think this isn't the case, but I guess I should be lenient. Even Hilmar got this one wrong.
---
lmao, none of that is true or reality.
---
yikes
---
Is the joint-ownership agreement the same thing as the "profit-sharing agreement" Vily talked about 2 months ago? I quoted him from 2 months ago, after the profit-sharing agreement was signed.
---
I have no problem with his comments 8 months ago. Obviously the future is unknowable. But making a promise about the future AFTER you've given up majority ownership (2 months ago) is irresponsible at the very least.
---
Been a while since 1bil ISK's worth of PLEX was worth months of sub. Even in 2013, 1 PLEX was 500-600mil, so 1 bil was at most 2 months of subscription. You have to go back to 2010-2011 before PLEX becomes worth 300mil so you can afford 3 months of a sub with 1bil.
---
no you cant. 2 native + 2 thanks to rigs.  
---
awful suggestion btw
---
You basically want to break the game fundamentally. I'm not talking about care bears or not wanting changes, but some of your ideas would literally break how eve works.
---
I guess that would largely dependent on some coefficient of how much you drink while playing Eve and how big your pee bucket is.
---
each citadel final blow yields a Chaos Orb
---
Inflation, caused indirectly (I guess lol) by bad game design choices for the past few years. 
---
For reference, PLEX to sub an account in Dec of 2016 was under 900m, it‚Äôs now between 2.0-2.2 bill to sub an account. Less than 3 years later üëçüèª
---
Map Intel is perfect Intel of number of NPCs killed and number of jumps into the system. You only want to keep that Intel because it supports your style of play and that is hypocritical. If you want to go hunt people put some work into it instead of having the game deliver you a list of systems people are using.
---
How does blackout relate to fog of war exactly?
---
When a system, especially one involving power, goes out, or communications go down, this is called a blackout.
---
girlfriend insults at live events
---
My best explanation is.
---
Eve is a very big board game.
---
Look at the map and zoom all the way in, think about all the options you have in your system as far as game play choices.
---
Now zoom out to constellation,  what gameplay choices are there now.
---
Zoom out all the way, what are you options now?
---
What do you want to do in Eve?
---
This has to be the worst idea I‚Äôve ever read on this sub. At least top 10 worst
---
Tristans.
---
If that's what they are called, yes lol
---
&gt;put some work into it
---
get a job if you want to work lmao
---
I feel like a Titan should fill that role.
---
Give it a module that causes it to actually turn into a staging base of sorts on a consumable, timer, and anchoring distance.
---
I prefer [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37qanRa2o6oa2l0TkMNdnD?si=rIYZSb6wRbOpBU8jB0a13w](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37qanRa2o6oa2l0TkMNdnD?si=rIYZSb6wRbOpBU8jB0a13w)  but each to their own I guess.
---
Remove the emergency cyno option on hulls!
---
Well you've got me there. I retract my previous statement.
---
&gt; How does every other game do it? They get a small newbie zone where people are discouraged from harming newbies.
---
Isn't that &gt;.9 sec space and starter systems?
---
My favorite part is the moon sitting there, not being mined, not generating anything for anyone, but to mine it you not only have to rent and fuel the moon for a few hundred million a month, you have to pay taxes on what you mine. 
---
It's great!
---
I disagree. The majority of WH space does not have farmholes. Most corporations have nothing to do with farmholes. If you want to evict a farmhole, it's really easy.
---
Fine changed it to effort, though amusingly people implied nullsec players should have to work protect their space against drifters and be happy to pay CCP for that privelage.
---
At least I know you have no actual argument since you are reduced to picking out a single word as being slightly incorrect.
---
what is this post
---
By "direct manipulation" do you mean infinitely respawning anoms that can be easily cleared with bots, even free-to-play Alphas in VNIs?
---
To a degreee that always existed with bounties being the largest influx of liquidity into the system.  
---
Alphas added F2P VNIs it got worse because now there is no Plex cost to subbing that account, it generates some isk/hr, 23/7, and is infinitely scalable.  
---
Skill injectors added a passive almost free way to get an Omega account (sell the excess SP) which you can then use to make isk in other ways as well (capital/super ratting).
---
Jump fatigue + high ADMs + cyno inhibs + etc means infinite respawns of minerals and rats in a concentrated area that can be covered by a capital umbrella.
---
Add a stale meta and you have a lot of accounts generating isk and using it for PLEX at a greater than previous rate/subbed account.  This dramatically inflates the value if isk with both inflation and demand vs suply.
---
Null has always been dangerous not having concord, gate guns and roaming groups killing whatever they can catch.  The danger isn't the issue, the losses aren't the issue it's the lack of counterplay.  However null will adapt and survive just fine, eventually.
---
Because there is people who doesn't use back up cloacky cyno alt when they rat/mine ?
---
I suggest leaving the big blocks for smaller entity. Or asking your leadership to stop being friends with all the other big blocks.
---
New players do not want to mine. They do it, because they are being lied to this is the best way to start.
---
Some of them get the rare chance to be recruited in a PvP corp, that covera i itial expenses and see where the real fun is.
---
The promise 8 months ago was to not raise rates.  2 months ago, he made the joint ownership/profit sharing agreement.  The agreement left TESTs name on the TTT and gave them fueling responsibility.   Profit and management decisions were shared with other entities; of which TEST is one of many.   Couple days ago, there was a vote to increase rates.
---
Sadly, it's not good enough.  It's the full rule set.  It has people who interfere.  Their efforts mean nothing.   There is no reason to start, and the sandbox doesn't work if they think it's like every other MMO, where you go from shooting whomprats to shooting titans.  
---
So reduce it down.  Make it easy.  Hell, make it a progressive system where they go from one  one-way wormhole to another.  Where they add more things.  But give them a clear path to go towards.
---
When I started back in the distant years of 2013 Plex cost about 300-350 million.
---
I don't know how to breat it down to you, but in short - yeah.
---
You of all people know how many good people that have quit.  And if they had more idiots to kill, they might actually come back.
---
Oh you're right, I forgot supers are the only thing worth making in EVE. 
---
The LS connections are random, but that doesn't make them rare. It does take a little work to export, but not much. People will buy caps from just about anywhere in LS, trust me I've sold all over.
---
The point I was making in my last post is that how many links you can put into your high slots is *irrelevant*. Only 2 of them would have to be aimed, once per minute. Is that really too much to handle? I can sort of understand the critique that it might nerf links in nano/small gang PVP (even though in the small gang PVP that I've participated in, where one of the 2 groups is kiting the other, the direction generally didn't change very rapidly). But the fact that aiming 2 things once per minute would be too much, I really don't get this critique.
---
Summon the horde inquisitors! What do you mean we don't have any?
---
If you want to multibox, you can log one character per omega account at the same time. So if you want 2 characters online, you need 2 omega accounts. Only one alpha at any given time, and only one char per omega acc. The other slots can be used for PI, trading, backup wormhole scanner, whatever you can think of. To train them, you have one training queue per acc which you can switch to the other slots, or purchase Multiple Character Training certificates for an additional queue for a month on that account. Dedicated alts don't need to train once they've reached their level. But it's going to cost time and/or Plex to get them there.
---
Wow, I thought I was good at EvE-economics, but I hadn't even thought of or been exposed to 3 and 5.  
---
Probably because I was in corps that primarily cared about PvP and I don't think there were any super-krabs in any of them.  No one I knew had more than 3 accounts, including those who had lived in WHs.
---
It's not free, work has to be done to get it.
---
leadership and TOP TIER FCs need to stop being chummy and hanging out in common discords and shit. 
---
as for in-game mechanics changes, make citadels less cancerous to kill so it doesnt take 3000 autists in titans to grind down a region.
---
Do you think Goons will be able to send out an intel alert when the number of jumps goes up by one between some set of systems?  Do you know how many people live in Delve and how often those people jump gates? Dotlan updates every 20 minutes or half hour, I believe.  By the time this mythical Dotlan intel system alerts ratters, I'll have gone 20 jumps, or tackled somebody.  There is no need to "nerf" Dotlan.
---
There's nothing stopping the alliance that owns the moon making it public (within the alliance).  There's no reason it *has* to be rented out as long as the ore gets taxed.  It's quite bulky and doesn't get compression so it's not really economic to take it elsewhere to avoid this.
---
An enlightened leader wants members to get wealthier.  Directors who get wealthier aren't any use to anyone.
---
lol thinking you can do that with jump count
---
it'll desync so fast
---
Less boring / defensive advantage structure warfare
---
I love how you say you are doing the high sec war for content and then say that its also because of the blueing of large portions of null sec.  Here's a thought, unblue?  It's literally a choice by Nullsec players causing their own problem.  I also love how you are trying to point out that "All Goons aren't the same."  But in reality you all work towards the same goals as is dictated by Goon leadership.  Even if you are somehow different within goons that doesnt mean you are breaking away from the group think mentality and shared current goals.  By even being a part of them you are supporting that culture.  That is also generally how alliances work, even if only one part of the alliance does something, because you are loyally under that banner you get to also share the responsibility of the actions.  If you want to be really different, leave Goons.
---
&gt; Anything you can access via the Map you can access outside the client
---
that's not true
---
Replace "1 OCD nerd" with "A fucking discord bot" and you got it right
---
I think I might've whiffed on this one. Or at least, people seem very upset at what I wrote.
---
&gt; the stuff you gave still gives away too much intel outside of the game client.
---
since you have no idea what that is....
---
Region locking moon goo to an extent would help a little bit. The other suggestions would actually have the opposite affect. 
---
Driving war would actually be fairly simple, decrease anoms per system, increase respawn time of both ratting and mining anoms, decrease regular ore from moons. Create a scarcity that forces large groups to move outside their regions if they wish to make $$$ creating conflict. Follow this up with nerfs to citadel tz tanking, and adding fatigue (even a small amount to jbs) making it more difficult to move your entire force region to region in minutes.
---
I did notice that Q has an over abundance of Cobalt to a mega degree. Are the percentages published anywhere?
---
if it was, it would be listed here: [https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/204873262-Known-Declared-Exploits](https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/204873262-Known-Declared-Exploits)
---
Test and 'keeping their word'.
---
*laughs in 'ToldYou'*
---
They really need to make an automining flex structure that mines to the flex structure's hold slowly.
---
Exploding the flex structure leaves all the ore available for loot.
---
The game is already full of idiots. Do we really need CCP to try and give us *more* idiots?
---
EVE is popular to the people who play it because it ISN'T like every other game. That's the draw for new players as well.
---
Get rid of all the in-game newbie help bullshit. Just start each new player in a pocket of space in a rookie ship with a message that says: "Fly bitch." Force the player to seek out the information, which they need to learn how to do anyway if they're going to keep playing. 
---
No point in gaining a million new players who try the game and then quit. I'd much rather have a smaller group of people who try the game and stay.
---
A lot on reddit but there‚Äôs a hilariously large amount of salt on the forums (who the fuck used the forums)
---
Just remove the ingame map as well, mix things up. Make people actually have to explore.
---
Yea I heard a similar story about station games. Supposively you could place a large bubble on the undock of a station. (This is before stations had guns and tether) 
---
The people inside were trapped unless they fought or killed the bubble. 
---
I saw some PVP videos where people had big fights on the undock of their stations. Once CCP had a pretty good idea where you could turn the services offline too
---
Wipe the server and then tokenize in game assets as erc20 tokens.  
---
Now everything has real world value.
---
I think there's a couple different cases at play.
---
1- In the bot havens of Branch or Drones that rely on distance from NPC Null or Low for safety, the amount of jumps in pipes is very low, and a gank fleet sizable enough to threaten their ratting supers will be noticeable as high traffic outside of pockets.
---
2. In a populated area like Delve, that information won't be useful for delve itself, but a jump/inspace spike in NPC can warn of a gankfleet coming after Rorqs/Supers. It won't benefit subcap ratters since those can be solo ganked, but I expect subcap ratters to disappear from null anyways.
---
Yeah like skilling up a minimum wage vni a setting it up at 60 km orbit. It is kinda not free of course but clearly too good in terms of isk, so the fun is traded.
---
The only people that think anything in the game should be monotonous boring work are braindead neets
---
People want nullsec people to have a reason to undock, and for there to be realistic objectives for conflict, not extra braindead work
---
People are just making fun of the whiny nullsec leaders for making such an outrage over the drifters, especially since they've clearly exceeded the amount of structures CCP expected when designing them. Everyone would much rather the things just have more realistic timer mechanics, and not take 10 days to bash one of the 8 500m raitarus on every gate.
---
guys, un super under un umbrella is very low risk, a carrier take more risk to get killed before the back up came.  
---
I just saw a guy doing a C5 core garrison + drifter with only two nestors. max pimp, on the edge of the tank several time, sitting inside an anchorable buble for 30 min while being hard tackle by the drifter...  
---
this is hot
---
EVE is not for everyone.
---
...when local spikes to 1000, does the unit just go offline?...
---
Heck, why not?  
---
System overload, rebooting. ... ... ...
---
Loading emergency protocol please wait. ...
---
(Quoting is hard, sorry)
---
The sticks themselves sell very well to null players.
---
I know quite a few people looking to purchase some.
---
yeah thats been established. what guigui lechat said was right, i thought it gave all of the stuff of the map away. 
---
the stuff he mentioned is still imo too much.
---
Good idea, let's make finding fights even harder than it already is!
---
Another thing to give bots advantage, as they can just read that from memory, but legit players can't.
---
Make sure to sign up with a referral code. Apparently, you get 750k skillpoints that way. Apparently it's not a huge deal as you play more but feels like a ton at the beginning.
---
Pando suggested something in coms the other day akin to limiting total structures in space. Something like 1-2 keepstars per region, 2-3 sotiyo per region. Make them matter and be strategic.  
---
In that same vein, I'm of the mind that only certain systems should be able to have mining anom upgrades and others ratting anom upgrades. Sometimes, maybe rarely they could both be eligable in the same system. Call it 1 in 3 systems can have up to a colossal, 1 in 3 can have up to an enormous, 1 in 3 can have a large belt. Similar percentages of upgradeable ratting volumes. But a similar nerf/change would need to be done to incursion running 24/7.
---
My point is that 2 months ago (as linked in my initial comment) Vily said "when we anchored the TTT i promised they would never go above .3%. i will keep my word."
---
Renewing your promise AFTER you cede control of the TTT is irresponsible at best.
---
Well, weirdly, they have kind of done that...the career agents have had aura removed so there is nothing to tell you about where the various screens are found, and the mission dropdowns are full of useful information such as "Mine Tritanium"
---
Why did they change it, it sounds like a lot of fun! I mean Im really happy I can warp off my carrier and be instantly tethered/safe in a station I can't dock in when some bad guy's come but i get bored of always ratting in my carrier.
---
Here's where you're wrong.  You only need one ship to hunt in Delve.  That one ship fits a cyno.  The gank fleet never jumps gates because it jumps to the cyno of the tackled ratter/rorq/whatever.  Again, dotlan/in-game jump stats are a terrible intel tool.
---
Come on, you want to change nullsrc into connected wh space fuck off. 
---
The black out It‚Äôs fun as is but of course there was going to be someone wanting more

"It is good to sometimes completely surprise them so next time they will have no idea if I am serious or not."
---
Now that is the most elite form of shitpost.
---
Another whiny idiot posting instead of playing. Probably slithered over from tis discord.
---
This is a disgusting statement
---
Just bring back passive moon mining with POSes.  Turns out the POS code was good for something.
---
That would be so funny...  Null blackout, but wormholes get live local while null is blacked out.
---
Not publicly. I know them, of course, but that's something I'm not at liberty to divulge. Sorry!
---
Incentives to bring significant others to fan fest.
---
Almost half the structure we have are for moon mining, which would have been POS before, so that's really on ccp for those. Maybe ccp should change citadel mechanics instead of punishing players for using them, by creating an unrelenting pve mechanic.
---
There are a lot of people who join eve who want to mine.  they're sold on the idea by CCP at some point, talk to some of the newbies sometimes. but because it takes forever to pay for stuff, people don't bother.
---
Top 20 anyway
---
yawn
---
Telling bitter vets that you could have more targets, more people, and CCP could make more money, but people are resistant to change.
---
Well in a systems where you have 2jumps daily .....
---
dude its bbtb2 come on
---
to move supers
---
Haha. You can scribble it and drop it on the floor. I'll walk by with bubble gum on my shoe to grab it.
---
&gt;I don't see why any of these things are needed.          
---
So you need to bring more than 2 sabres into a fight!
---
Same goes for Smartbombing-Setups, standard 4 Machariel Setup for Rock Havens is also over 8 Bil investment.
---
Passive income puts less people in space. Not more.
---
The NPE should be difficult but still engaging to new players.
---
The "Here's a ship, fuck you" approach of old met one of those criteria but not really the other.
---
Not that I know what would make a good NPE.
---
This
---
Oh, hey.  Look at what you added to the thread.
---
Because they're pussies.
---
Show me the increase in kills/fights generated by the current moon mining meta?  
---
Passive income gives people something to fight over.  The best times I had in nullsec were fleets where we were going to bash someone's moon mining POS or defend one of our own.  It wasn't the current citadel timer cancer, it was spontaneous, and it was fun.  
---
In that one way, POSes were better than anything the current meta has.
---
All of the public information isn't required to find kills.
---
If you roam for long enough (not each day, I mean just not vacationing in PvP like the majority of nullsec) you learn where to go, when, what's active, and who's awake. It's not entirely hard to have contacts and friends that call you for things and talk about what's good and where.
---
Well yes of course I don't think anybody actually thinks drifters are fun and good gameplay but it's hilarious when 5000+ man groups cry about 30 leadership guys having to defend gate astrahuses lmao
---
It didn't "tank the economy" though it did tank the mineral prices.  Minerals are only one part of an economy that includes PI, salvage, BPCs, decryptors, moon goo, etc.etc albeit an important part.
---
What Rorqs and injectors did do was remove/diminish the two main obstacles to cap/super proliferation.  Minerals were the cost of caps, and injectors the limitation to flying them.
---
You still have to do those Lv5 mission, it's not fucked up like afk-vni on 5account and more
---
My love for blasters is relatively recent. I used to hate them. Caldari guy so I always had a preference to missiles and flew a Tengu. But after coming back to the game from a very long hiatus and moving to null, I started flying around in a blaster Merlin for shits and giggles. Took out a Sabre with it and instantly fell in love with blasters. Even though I can blaster fit my Tengu, the difference in DPS and the advantage of armor tanking made me skill into and switch to a Proteus as my T3C of choice.
---
&gt; Also, it seems clear that CCP is rolling out these big shake-up changes in waves.
---
I'm hoping to see creation of systems farther out into deep nullsec where /u/stainguy's wishes are fulfilled (blackout systems).
---
In the wave after that I'd hope to see systems completely dominated by NPCs using the most brutal tactics like maintaining smartbombing battleships around bubbled gates and 24-hour combat scan probes that relentlessly hunt you down even if you do manage to get in. Getting into the core of one of these NPC nests would not provide any significant reward just like how climbing Mt. Everest only gets you bragging rights. Therefore all loot would be tech 1. Break the pattern of "high risk, high reward".
---
Having to take a shot in the dark and ending up doing 50 jumps in empty systems/constellations/regions seems fun. Might as well not undock, you can also inspect your ship from all the different angles from the station.
---
The best times you had may be anecdotal or biased as well. I'm not saying they are wrong, just anecdotal. POS are going away. Unless we want to turn athanors into passive ore drains, but that denies 95 % of eve getting to take part in the t2 life cycle. Perhaps a change to athanors as in no defensive weapons on them and no tether?
---
The main purpose I guess is them causing nostalgia amongst Lowsec-PvP-Groups about the once glorious times with weekly tower fights and alliance SRP without belonging to a donut.
---
the entire context of this discussion is tailing a fleeing/moving fleet, you already know how many there are roughly in the composition, you then use common sense to evaluate the scans, stop overcomplicating things. It takes like ~3 warps to get even the biggest of systems fully dscanned, the probes are for a rough estimate in the first ~5 seconds of being in system, if you want to be more precise take the extra 20-30 seconds worst case to check the whole system on dscan. 
---
it would go like this: get in system -&gt; dscan, launch and activate probes and start warping to the first cluster(or a further one if the path overlaps) -&gt; -&gt;they're not on dscan-&gt; take the warp while mashing dscan -&gt; now you probably have the probe result and based on the number of hits(even unidentified ones) you can prob deduce if they're in system or not -&gt; keep dscanning and probing if you wanna know more. The whole initial process should not take more than 10 seconds, depending on how thorough you wanna be might take longer but using something like pathfinder would only make things slower, you're not leisurely building and scanning a chain, you're trying to find where nerds aware of you are so you can shoot them.
---
Let‚Äôs make this happen
---
eve is not a high risk high reward for a while.                   
---
you have frigate burners letting you make more isk than a super ratting in a ship for 150mil.            
---
triglavian space, letting you do even more in higsec             
---
wormhole capital ratting where you cut off all entry routes and kill the final bosses using citadel weapons.
---
I don't seriously think POSes should stay.  But I like the idea of a non-cancerous content generator.  Citadels, by and large, were a good addition, if only they could sort out the hell that a structure grind became.  I'd be fine with Athanors that passively mine only a fraction, or only lower end goos.  Something a PvP corp could put down (as we used to in my old null days) to fund SRP and force some fights.  But the key to making it all work is a better structure grind.  That's where the POS code shined, in my opinion.
---
So basically Stellaris
---
I don't see the connection between local and these points, local is a live update. All the points you made above take minutes or even 10's of minutes to update both in game and Dotlan. I see them as in completely different categories.
---
now you have to use renter to mine those moon, mine everyday that's fun for sure
---
Making money should be more pvevp, where scarcity i ressources makes people fight over money. Maybe in a king of the hill scenario.
---
You are right, the biggest risk to a super under an umbrella is its own retarded pilot, as these are the guys that are attracted by super ratting under an umbrella like flies to a candle. Otherwise I wonder why weekly several dudes manage to die in Delve ...
---
Once I liquidate my assets I'll get in the pub. I dont have that character anymore.
---
Really hope they bring back automated moon, renter are useless mining is boring, moooaarr waaahgg
---
Gonna have to play EVE smh
---
This is stupid. 90% of nullsec is dependent on local. End of massive resource gathering via Rorqs. End of taxing bounties via carrier (especially Nyx) ratting. This is CCP going full-retard and bowing to the small handful of downs kids REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEing about no local. 
---
Lowsec is the next null sec. Null is already vastly empty aside from the condensed concentration per alliance... it is going to become even more empty with no local. 
---
It's already easy enough to pick off rorqs and carriers not paying attention. Now it will just end and lowsec doesn't allow for all of the upgrades FOR ratting and mining. 
---
The only result will be less targets and more whining from the 'elite pvpers' about not having easy targets.
---
Like I tell my kids when they finally realize why I tell them 'NO!' to stupid ideas. They do it anyway and alas 'Congratulations, you got what you wanted...' as they feel completely humiliated and embarrassed.
---
I wouldn't mind this for "bad moons" - R16s and down, that aren't usually putting people in space.
---
Kinda what I was thinking. I'm not a programmer and dont know anything about coding, but this sounds like writing a lot of extra scripts that could break shit pretty easily.
---
Remember the Abyssal modules threads? :D
---
lmao
---
I dont know about you, but trading feroxs during a 1.5 hour long battle without bombs and caps was awful gameplay.  /s
---
A lot of the problem with Eve is that people play the same game for years on end and don't expect it to become boring and routine.  Of course it fucking will.  Variety is the spice and all that.  People at the tops of alliances get to meta and dick about with politics and so forth; something most of us line members are only ever on the receiving end of, having no involvement otherwise.  So for them maybe it's never boring.
---
Anyway the game hasn't changed that much since 2003.  It really hasn't.  It's never really had a consistent, coherent ruleset either, e.g. for example "T1, meta, faction, T2, T3" what the fuck.  Who the hell can work this stuff out except some nerd with a spreadsheet.
---
This won't change until there's an Eve II.  And if I'm designing it it'll be based on some very basic, simple principles, like Homeworld was :p.
---
Hire me!!!
---
Literally the worst idea I've ever heard..... Like wow....
---
Farmhole means it's you only on that hole, or you and another fellow corp member. You are basically alone in a farmhole.
---
Decreasing ore availability and quality as people mine more? Like scaling security status of a system as people rat or mine more forcing them to move on?
---
Krabs don‚Äôt need to buy plex, since money making is mostly what they do
---
Can you explain why?
---
Here's one, nerf all supers and titans so they are at most, 2-3x  as good as a carrier/dread, then introduce a price and pilot effective hard-counter to supercaps, then hard nerf fighters so carriers can't project a bubble of "no subcaps allowed". I'd even go further, by introducing a maintenance fee on all supers and allow them to be Pearl Harbored if docked in a citadel.
---
Bloc's don't want to fight because the only real thing that matters is super/titan count. Supers and titans are expensive and can't be replaced quickly, so you need a stockpile that sucks up all the excess wealth that blocs generate. If you run out of Super/Titan there's not enough time to rebuild a stockpile and you get helicopter dicked. That stockpile and the list of active super pilots can take years to rebuild, which is why Imperium didn't contest after losing supercap superiority in 2016, and why Pamfam didn't contest in 2018.
---
If you want blocs to fight, reduce the total amount of combat power that can be stockpiled through any combination of making stockpiling excessively expensive (license fees on supercaps), making stockpiled power less effective (reduce the combat power of supercaps, pilot count effective hard counters), making the stockpile vulnerable (armor/structure-timer keepstar ejects all unpiloted supers?), and making the second-best alternative competitive.
---
I never said there wasn't a connection between the two spaces. Things still get imported and exported, the politics in null can affect those in highsec and vice versa, and a thousand other things. What's naive is your idea that people can't live in null without ever going back to high sec to the point they must have a jump clone in highsec.
---
Pew pew

people open dotlan, look for stats, then fly straight to those places. free intel.

so free intel?

---
they also claim that 10Ks OF NEW PLAYERS try the game every month when they really talk about account creation.
---
I would be surprised if there are more than 50-100k actual players active at this point, which would be in line with the drop in activity in game and on discusion platforms for which we have stats and projections we can compare to the number of active players when CCP stopped releasing them.
---
Yeah it threw one part of that balance out of whack, thus tanking the economy. It also lead to insane super cap proliferation, which lead to a massive inflation of isk
---
In some cases they did, but I agree it was mostly used as an incentive for a fight.
---
QE He4 is PLEX
---
My dude, nobody is ever gonna seriously run entosis ops just so they can roam through someone's space. That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. People would just get the upgrade in every system and life would go on as it has been thus far, you'd just have 1% higher taxes.
---
Why not just shorten that wall of text to what you really mean. Remove capitals from EVE.
---
Far as I know, the number of drifters is not proportional to the structures in space, and they attack haphazardly and so far aren't committing to taking down single structures and instead just being a nuisance, one that is easily cleaned up with enough force but can't be whittled away at with low investment.
---
It also feels to me like Mittens is less worried about what Drifters are doing right now and more about what CCP could make them do next. Engage targets smarter, plan assaults on individual structures to put them through several reinforcement timers, that sort of thing. That's what I've gleaned from context at least.
---
Now that I'm done defending him: He is so extremely salty about being forced to play this game by the rules of anyone other than himself, huh? Not being top dog for once really hurts, huh? Well too bad he's not lead designer for CCP. But then he wouldn't be able to run the alliance on the side. 
---
I understand it must be galling to have your sights set on eventually dictating the entire meta of the game, and then being reminded by CCP that you're just a player like any other, community status notwithstanding. That's all this is. Plus a lot of spin ofc. How hard is it to be a good sportsman, lol
---
tl;dr his concerns are more reasonable than OP says, but his response to them a lot less so
---
Me neither, that's where the "elite" go to be great like CODE and such. Just makes it more interesting .

I'll be subscribing to EVE for the first time in a while.

Nah, we need something new.

Maybe fueling observatories require exotic fuel or refinery chips which can be gathered from looting (lorewise: salvaged) abandoned small drifter bases. These spawn random and are searchable from the agency. People will hurry there and try and hold the field(or shoot the base) to make the refinery chips lootable. 
---
Obviously sites with different sizes to make it worth or worthless to do depending on your fleetsize. 
---
If you create content that are worth fighting over, you create conflict and people shoot eachother. Thats why some of the events had sites that were great places for pvp.
---
They don't have to be removed, just nerfed and made vulnerable so a good defense can consistently pick off even blobbed supers price effectively.
---
Do what sounds fun to you, Mining, PVP, PVE. With that being said all my different main characters have PI skills somewhat up for some sort of passive income. Omega up if you want to duel box these accounts and have access to the better ships for whatever you choose so be it mining, which would be exhumers, orca or rorqual. pvp would definitely be the Triglavian ship line or T2 cruisers, caps for when you get there and the best ratting ships if I remember correctly an alpha can use with the exception of the Ishtar and carriers.
---
I wish
---
false flag concern troll detected
---
If you want two characters online at the same time, Omega is required. (While yes, it's possible to work round the technical limitation on that, it's against the EULA. so if you do it, prepare to eat a ban)
---
There's no requirement to have an alt. Until you know there's something you want to do with it, I'd skip it.
---
thanks for your dissertation, professor, but CCP is moving on ahead with this.
---
Nice try, your false concerns noted.
---
We can only hope that Local on Jita undock gives them herpes
---
I mean, literally everyone told them exactly how the changes were going to destroy the economy and they did it anyway, so I think that makes it direct cause by CCP rather than indirect.
---
I generally agree - if CCP is going to do it, do it right.
---
Just wait until Null blocs can see you coming but you have no idea cause of the info network structures.
---
I have spoken in favor of a dreadnaught type ship that can not mount haws but gains a bonus to anti cap guns at +100 % vs. supers and titans to be an effective anti super force. Would have to be balanced to not outright replace a dread bomb.
---
You can make such a ridiculous amount of isk running PI that I think every alt should make those skills a goal.
---
Unfortunately, HR at CCP misunderstood their boss's accent, and hired a bunch of gene-asses instead of geniuses.
---
 **cyno jammer nerfs**
---
\- I've been on too many fleets where potentially epic level fights fizzle out because of cyno jammers. Change their reinforcement timers and the ease of onlining replacements.
---
**new ultra valuable region locked resources (that are depletable)**
---
\- Give alliances something extremely valuable worth fighting wars over
---
**Dynamic anomaly distribution**
---
\- Some regions have way more ratting anomalies while others have way more mining anomalies
---
**Resource depletion**
---
\- Over a relatively long period of time a region may become barren of lucrative anomalies due to farming
---
**more supercap counters, less direct nerfs**
---
\- lower dread mineral costs, increase dps, add anticapital bombers. Maybe a cut to supercapital ehp across the board (say 20%)
---
**Rorqual rework**
---
\- Buff mining output, increase apm (mining fighters, smaller ore hold to increase compression apm). Keeps rorqs lucrative but limits multiboxing.
---
**Citadels have one reinforce timer/no more timezone tanking**
---
\- do I really need to say more?
---
It is not unusable, but it would be a bonus to directional gameplay for larger fleets and might give ccp some base coding to build directional fire off of for eventual incorporation with weapons systems that are align directed . Baby steps.
---
Why are there no tempest fleet issue fleets around? On paper they look like they should be able to work basically like sniping armor hacs. They have a similar cost, but a TFI has way more range, stupidly more tank, better alpha, better fitting, better drone options...
---
Is it just too vulnerable to bombing? They're not even much slower
---
CCP should add a way for groups not to post their killmails to killboards.
---
lmao what
---
People will just put alt accounts by gates like you do and use adashboard intel more. Running a bunch of accounts isn‚Äôt some leet skill.
---
I can see why cloaky campers are concerned tho. Much easier to hit a button when local flashes for you rather than using dscan on each account that has a 14au limit.
---
I mean, if there wasn't an ansiblex line, and it would be 3 mids, we'd just take wormholes.
---
I fucking love so few people realized who you are. I‚Äôve been inactive for a year, and only played for a little over a year prior. Even I know who joecuster is - and the fact some regular posters here went all #serious is hilarious. Bravo Joe.
---
Are you suggesting that new players are still harassed/ have a hard time doing stuff in the starter systems? Its supposed to be a bannable offence to do that, whether or not thats enforced I am not sure, is this a problem?
---
Pretty sure it is the basic response to any newish concept or idea.. delete this!
---
I would absolutely vote for 1 shield timer at 24 vulnerability and 1 time zone hull timer. You could fit a L/XL with a module for 1 more timer but it's also 24 vulnerability and it's 24h after the first timer. Also, the module is expensive as hell.
---
Join a new player group as others have suggested. My two cents, go for Pandemic Horde and let the help you learn the game.
---
EvE by yourself is boring.
---
EvE with corp mates is awesome.
---
The null blocs are the problem. I saw the writing on the wall a decade ago. Bring back interesting, intriguing, exciting alliances or this fucker dies. It's not there yet, but it's close.
---
You are making the comparison, not me. You are the one saying wh is safer given no local in both.
---
With respect to safety, it doesn't matter whether hunters have easier access to regions if they keep getting titanblobbed each drop. Yes, even without local umbrella space is safer.
---
People got tore apart on here for implying it was a not fun mechanic. When Dran posted the time required by an alliance to defend these people implied that was fine. No one should have been celebrating the nullsec leaders struggling to deal with this.
---
It is a decent idea , very much discussed (for weapons and interactions with collision able items)and small gangs would probably love it , power blocs hate change  and you are introducing another calc that would kill many hampsters.
---
not really, but when we have 24 people in fleet, everyone shoots whatever they want. and with that many ships small pos goes down in 20 minutes, medium in 40 and large in 70-90 minutes
---
NPC Taxes. yeeeah.
---
Agreed, I wouldn't be completely against some evaluation of the type of statistics, like possibly NPC and Player Kills could be rolled into some kind of 'Activity' metric. That data is used not just to find people ratting but also for the ratters to decide where to rat. So it goes both ways. 
---
The key being data is a fun part of the game and allows for more calculated decision making, removing it would be a terrible idea. But adjusting the design of it slightly might help. 
---
If you look at it from a mining perspective people usually cluster in lower security space and ice is an obvious target. But you can't actively get 'Mining Per Hour' on Dotlan. I feel this is a good example of how calculated decisions can still be made by the design and location of content, rather that a very specific metric.
---
ok?
---
&gt;So someone please explain why would you fight over such shit money it just doesn't add up to me...
---
There‚Äôs a bit of a trend in many wars that are often not mentioned when talking about major battles. It wasn‚Äôt often that a single moon ever held enough value to justify dumping billions to defend it. However a collection of moons in a given area would collectively could produce a lot. Groups typically invaded an area to claim any profitable moons they could get their hands on, not just a single moon and then call it a day. 
---
For me, one of the biggest losses from the POS to structure changeover was the massive decrease in pace of play. At the absolute worst, POSes took a maximum of like 2 days from start to finish. Now 2 (2.5?) days is the minimum, with up to a week or two being closer to the mean.
---
That's how it was when I started. I had all my friends subbed and in my Corp within a month. It was tough, but fucking awesome.
---
Tech 2 strategic bombers based on ABC hulls. They fit a "ballistic missile launcher" that hits supercaps in a 50km radius for a million damage. Somewhat less damage to caps and negligible to subcaps.
---
dropping on solo t1 cruisers? mad lads
---
How about a directional array on the ship that can point at œÄ /3 segments but requires refit to change.
---
The resources on moons were not available in every region. So prices of the product varied encouraging entrepreneurs to try to take a moon.
---
That's exactly what it looks like. Give a strong case to prove otherwise or clap that trap shut
---
None of this is about abstract fairness issues of giving one method to hunters and not farmers. That's exactly the kind of bad thinking I am warning about.
---
This is all about catalysing more PvP interactions by increasing risk in null. If it causes more kills, yes, hunters can have free Intel and where defenders don't.
---
And again, I don't think making null local like wormholes will catalyse PvP interactions so I don't support the change. But I also disagree with the bad thinking which amounts to: "CCP increasing risk in null therefore CCP should decrease risk in null"
---
lowsec hictor bots are a thing?
---
I‚Äôd accept a delayed local as a compromise but there has to be an end to instant local intel mainly to hinder the proliferation of Bots in rented space, as well as making Null sec a bit more dangerous for everybody.
---
Why not just 100 million damage? You are designing something that would be used in a fleet formation to destroy an entire super capital fleet in one pass in a matter of seconds. Why not just cut out the middle man and make it one ship, because it's just likely to be put into the game.
---
You could make a ridiculous amount of money multiboxing 400 accounts running lvl 1 courier missions too, but... damn
---
Do it!
---
True that, they do. But currently, 1 jf load is like 2years of fuel
---
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand eve videos with poems
---
"Make null more dangerous" specifically refers to danger to null residents. They are the ones currently in a position of game breaking extreme safety. Not hunters or whalers.
---
To foster more explosions. That's more important than any fairness issue you think exists here.
---
I'd rather burn the isk than let it go to ttc at 2:1. At 3+/1 however it's manageable to just suck it up and accept that it benefits them as well as me. So in a way this change simplifies things
---
Losing a single bling Guardian over a POCO makes it isk negative :P
---
Also for kicks and giggles I just looked up SC's old POCO empire. 1,067 POCOs lost. It's insane how big it was at the height of it.
---
Huh???  
---
They aren't making money.  They are making either minerals or isk.  If they are doing it with Omega accounts (read: multiple cap/super ratting or rorq pilots) then they have to sub those accounts somehow.  Either they are subbing with real real life moneys or they are buying PLEX.  
---
If they are subbing 10-20 accounts with real life money, then they will be a sorry loss for EvE.  If not then they were inflating the price of PLEX.
---
The burden of proof is on the accuser.
---
I am not wasting my time in life disproving nonsense on reddit.
---
I want people in space. That's why I don't advocate to removing local.
---
But if I did, I wouldn't do so to take away free Intel from everyone. I would do so to cause more PvP interaction.
---
If free Intel for hunters causes more interaction and free Intel for farmers blocks it, then I would take it away only from farmers.
---
I‚Äôm personally betting so many ppl think ‚Äúa ha, I‚Äôll go out on whaling fleets‚Äù that there isn‚Äôt enough things out there to catch. Most fights will happen when roving fleets land on same gate.
---
&gt; 2: A ticker over each gate showing the number of jumps in the last 15 mins or so. 
---
Could make this fuzzier and more in-universe by putting 'cooling radiators' on the gates - jumps in-and-out generate heat, and the cooling system goes from black, red, yellow, white, then to some sort of 'emergency cooling' mode where little jets of steam shoot-out.  There could be different radiators for inbound and outbound traffic, or just have one for both, depending on how much info you wanted to give. Base the heat-generation off of mass, or just the raw number of jumps.
---
The different gate types could have different locations or styles.
---
Remember when scan probes didn't get automatically recalled after a jump/dock? Now that was fun.
---
Only for excavator
---
Isk is the money currency in eve, yes. Making money
---
Omega required. Before you get a second account join a corporation and work with others to get the game full experience.
---
The Machariel does everything better. 1 extra turret for more alpha/dps, more maneuverable, and only slightly less EHP. The TFI also does less alpha/dps than the standard tempest but with a tracking bonus and more EHP.
---
Because a bomber wing can't usually delete battleships. The amount of bombs it takes is more than survive their own explosions, wiping out the rest of the bombs. A fleet battleship normally has around 120-200k EHP, call it single resist hole maybe 15 bombs at max skill through a hole. Maybe 20. You are well over the amount of bombs that survive coming in from the detonations.
---
They're probably ganking folks who are autopiloting.
---
Not sure what gave you that impression. I want to be able to actually pvp in this pvp game, not gate empty systems for hours on end with no clues as to where the 10 other remaining players are.
---
I think you are thinking the wrong way.  The people who supplied PLEX did so also when it was 400 mil (around when I joined), 1.1 bill (just before WWB), 850 mil (during WWB) and 2.2 bil.  They would rather fund a few months of Pew Pew with some $ than game grinding.  They have done well during this period of PLEX inflation, but my guess is most would rather have more people to Pew Pew than more isk with which to Pew Pew but fewer targets.
---
Observatories should grant a return to local functionality across a constellation or in a set LY radius- if it‚Äôs per system you need to visit every system hacking all of them 1 by 1 to remove local... removing any semblance of surprise or denying any real intel because they just watched you do it in like 15 systems; why would they be ratting in any of those 15 systems by that point? 
---
At least if it‚Äôs just 1 system, you can quickly hack it and run through the constellation/LY Radius.
---
Have you tried leaving the largest blue donut in the game
---
I don't think so. But releasing more fuel fueled structures is not a bad idea.
---
An exemplification of what PL is in 2019.
---
That's my point! LOL
---
I haven't seen armor HACs in a while either now that I think about it. Did the mach replace it in that role then?
---
Could just stop the bots for good, but that would be too easy.
---
You do realise that bots will be here, with or without local? And bots can spam d-scan better than people. The only real threat to them is drifters rn.
---
I don't know why everyone acts like no local will effect bots in the slightest, at best they'll be vulnerable for a few days until their code is updated, and then it'll be back to normal.
---
If that's where my corporation or alliance decides to go, sure? I've played with the same group of people for years. I like them. They are my friends. I enjoy playing with them. I'm also not the decision maker at those levels, so I can only do me and doing me isn't walking away from friends I play this game and others with and have met outside of game.
---
I disagree with the suggested items.
---
* who owns the system - doesn't matter on a short time scale such as hunting and probably wouldn't matter for large alliances picking regions to invade
---
* when he is active - no idea what this means
---
* how many jumps were made - this updates too slowly to be use to detect hunters and only gives you a general sense of activity in an area
---
* is a cyno light there - you have to be pretty on the ball to spot cyno's of importance already, anyone doing a covert op already does self destruct cyno's, lore wise this is also a big fking disturbance that everyone can detect regardless of the comms system
---
* what is the system index - I could see adding a delay to when the indexes are increased being a good thing, knowing the ratting index has increased is perfect information from a distance
---
* what are the timers - I assume you are talking about SOV timers, I could go either way on this one but major powers generally don't get involved in third party sov timers without a batphone already so I don't think much would change and it would remove information of interest to lurkers
---
* how many people are in system - this already has a sufficient time delay and is far from perfect information, anyone performing an ambush already works around this to avoid being a blob on the map, it means you need some knowledge/discipline to pull off surprises which is a good thing
---
* where the specific character is - I assume you are talking about locator agents, they are already balanced on time delays and locality of the agent to the target
---
Thank you.  I'm always looking for ambient music that fits with the original Eve soundtrack.  Surprisingly hard to find.
---
We're paying quadruple.
---
No I didn't say they couldn't live in null, but I did say they do need high sec. Pay attention. In some way form or another. A player in null is benefiting from something or someone in high sec. Period. Y'all are just trolling now.
---
Exploring in low sec is far more profitable than doing it in high sec.
---
No it‚Äôs not. Outside of plex and a few items, the buying power of isk has increased, not decreased, as mineral production has exceeded isk production. One isk gets you more titan or super arriwrcthab a few years ago. 
---
The result is not isk inflation, but power creep
---
No free moon goo must all be mined
---
VNI is getting nerfed, so it won't be as effective an isk maker for a ratting alt. 
---
The options you listed boil down to three things: 
---
 - Ratting: Gilas are still good but require more investment to get one up and running. It will easily pay for itself quickly after it's set up. 
---
 - PI: if you have the patience for it can be somewhat passive after it's set up, but for newer players it can be very tedious to start up and even more tedious to set up to be profitable enough to be worth it. 
---
 - Mining: Rorqual alts are extremely expensive as far as being new to the game goes. Also requiring a lot of experience with game mechanics, pvp mechanics, and capital mechanics if you want to not die like a idiot. 
---
- Also, Mining for starters isn't going to be in a rorqual, you will likely be investing into a Procurer while using the isk you make to start training toward larger ships. 
---
You can also try;
---
 - Exploration: Take a scanning frigate, and analyzers, play a minigame for loot. Bonus, being good at using scanner probes is a valuable skill for PVP as well. 
---
 - Gas Huffing: A bit more specialized form of mining, uses small ships and scanning probes to find valuable gas clouds to harvest. A bit more of a learning curve for this because you need to learn the scanning from exploration, and learn a bit about wormhole mechanics and sleepers. 
---
For my money, I would start prepping to make a Gila alt. It's the quickest and more straight forward way to start making decent amounts of isk. 
---
From there you can start funding your PVP and while you save up the isk you aren't using, you'll get more experience in the game and start to figure out which play styles best fit your tastes. 
---
Then you can use that isk to pursue that playstyle, or if it requires more isk, use it to make another gila account, train your original Gila account up into a larger ratting ship like Rattlesnake -&gt; Carrier, or try to invest in something else like mining or industry.
---
No, and also fuck you
---
shocked pikachu
---
Going through Kira is camped decently. Though I haven't had issues with the null after low.  Efa through the OTK pipe is the fastest to get through to the center lane of Querious, if you're quick. The lane is pretty open. Pockets will usually be met with out matched responses (I go solo frigates). Heading the other way deeper into null past initiative space to catch usually is pretty camped. Typically you can get to npc blood raider space in delve pretty easily but past that it's delve and goon Titans on bubble gates. Good fights from residents, not overly, but I don't really try to gank their care bears. I want fights. There are plenty of big systems that can't all be dscan at once.
---
What would be nice is two things: 
---
**Give us a reason to have small engagements in space**
---
**Make it harder to escape a fight at a moments notice**
---
If you want a fight, we can fight no problem. Also make brawling great again.
---
Wh is almost regular space already, it is mapped and searchable and the mechanics known. Golden age is over man.
---
Make it a new ultra needed resource that is very slow to collect and can be stolen.
---
There‚Äôs no harm in creating a second alpha account and skilling it up now. There‚Äôs no requirement to make either or both omega until you feel you want to.
---
If you want to remain alpha while diving deeper into the game, then you should, rather than shell out money. You don‚Äôt need to yet.
---
By the time you have worked out what you want to do, how you want to do it, and whether you want to subscribe, you‚Äôll probably know what sort of alt(s) you want. 
---
Take it slow.
---
Its either hawks or retribution‚Äôs depending on what tier you want to do
---
The only good guys IMO is in FW space. Kill the squids.
---
I think someone did a one for one comparison to the eve systems and found that they corilate. Perhaps it is new Eden after goons won.
---
Match drone damage to the hole from the abyssal site. Then use your small drones on small stuff, and bigger drones on bigger stuff
---
We keep reaching for the impossible dream.
---
this argument is peak retardation every time it comes up
---
we have ways to beat dscan, we have ways to beat networked gate watching eyes, we have ways to beat everything except local 
---
so now local is being deleted 
---
maybe it you used your real brain instead of running your bot army you'd realize how fucking dumb you are
---
go to wormholes bud
---
If you enjoy mining, having a booster alt in orca or something is great, or you can simply have your main miner in an orca and the alt defending it so you don't need to pay as much attention. 
---
Any character can be a PI character, it's not hard, doesn't take more than 500k skill points to do it well. 
---
If you don't have the ability to pay attention, focusing on a rorqual alt isn't advised, nor is it advised at this time due to CCP failing to make putting the rorq in space worthwhile unless you've got lots and lots of big friends. 
---
My only advice is: **If you know what you like, make an alt that helps you do that the way you want to do that activity.**
---
Oh man that's some sick content you guys are getting out there. You might want to work a bit on tightening up your extractions though. On that note,  I'd ask you about the video clip from [this fight](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77524769/), but i'd imagine that OP's client was glitched and he couldn't find the undock button when said loss occurred.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/eve/comments/bjc6t2/_/em70yqg
---
Vily promised to keep it lower even after that agreement was brokered. He's a  l i a r
---
So here's the thing.
---
No other passive sources are as accurate as Local. When you look up stats on the Map, it tells you how many ships or kills there were in the last 30 minutes. Not how many are there right this second. To find that out, you have to be in system doing a head count.
---
Well, if you want delayed Intel, then it should start to report names after 30 minutes, like the others do. If you want more up-to-date info, then deploy Probes and look for them yourself.
---
I'm all for having less automation, less automatic Intel, less of the game playing itself. If you want to stay safe out there in your lawless space, then actively defend yourself.
---
the walk of shame as we call in the Incursions....
---
How about making both sides put effort into it? Right now what CCP is attempting to create is a free range targets for hunters to kill at the expense of pve players. Pvp players get to know what systems they should go hunt in through no work but players being able to know they are being hunted for the same zero work is to much.
---
I get prodded to make these
---
Wb cyno disrupt bubbles that dictors could use rather than warp disrupt bubbles. Choose between one of them. Or a cyno disrupt ship class like a Hic but for cynos instead of warps
---
Yes, their unique features are the web bonus and scram bonus and most fits use those.
---
you can load multiple links with the same ammo lol
---
if you're really telling me I can boosh through an enemy fleet to nullify their links, wew
---
You do realize you can kill 90% of bots with anti cheat right? But then again it's so easy to find a bot for eve online. Just search Sanderling eve online in google. First few results will be a forum and how to setup your bot along with the download. What's stopping CCP from using thenreaources available for free to them?
---
Luckily CCP srps all losesnif you lie well enough
---
There were already going to be more skill farms because there are a lot more MPTCs on the market at a discount.
---
Skill farms can be had for PLEX or those.  
---
PLEX is much more complex and has to do with moving variables such as:
---
- are more krabbers unsubbing than PvP returning (or vice versa)
---
- will lower PLEX prices mean more PLEX redeemed for isk to pew or will the lower price mean fewer will be inclined to pew.  
---
- What will happen to other key mechanics if CCP ends up growing even bigger balls?
---
We don't know the elasticity of these various supply/dmand curves, and there are many of them.  I doubt CCP knows what they are either.  Only that there is an unhappy customer base.  If Pew-player base was dropping and the krabs were all buying PLEX, their cashflow would be hurting.
---
What makes you think the same limiters won't apply to these things?
---
When I was in a wormhole corp some of our allies would fly polarized vindicators into battle. They lost a good number of them but my God can those ruin your day
---
&gt;you can load multiple links with the same ammo lol 
---
Yeah, but they don't stack.
---
&gt;we have ways to beat dscan, we have ways to beat networked gate watching eyes, we have ways to beat everything except local
---
If that were true, you could just cloaky camp in any system and no bots would ever undock, idiot. It's not local that's defeating you. 
---
&gt;maybe it you used your real brain instead of running your bot army you'd realize how fucking dumb you are
---
I'm running a bot army now? You must be mentally handicapped. I'm saying it won't have much effect on bots. I'm not saying it shouldn't happen. I'm saying your hopes and dreams of a bot free eve from local changes won't happen. Idiot. 
---
&gt;so now local is being deleted 
---
Except if you'll look at the marketing from CCP, it's a fucking EVENT, not a deletion of local. Stop wishful thinking, and read what they've written, not what you want them to write. Idiot.
---
KMs aren't delayed in wspace. 
---
Would feel so weird though... killing something and looting wreck, then getting a KM a day later? 
---
I feel on board ship computers can calculate the damage dealt/taken to generate a KM without local being a thing (because it already works that way in Wspace without gates)
---
You pray for the rain you gotta learn to play in the mud.
---
Much worse, I like to leave my Nestor behind after refitting my super...
---
Your suggestion seems like one of the extremes that CCP avoids, like more aoe. Just not seeing it as more than wistful hope to 1 shot capitals.
---
The ship-spinning nerf is coming ...
---
No it isn‚Äôt lol
---
&gt;You do realize you can kill 90% of bots with anti cheat right?
---
Then why has it not been implemented? 
---
&gt;What's stopping CCP from using thenreaources available for free to them?
---
Lethargy, or income gained from botters to Plex multiple accounts when they start up? That's all I can think of.
---
*second
---
Ugh, I always forget how dumb you are
---
A) there are ships that can't be d-scanned.
---
B) instant local gives a bot 30+ seconds to align and warp out. D-scan reduces that to between 5-10 seconds. Plenty of time to catch a carrier or super.
---
C)d-scan doesn't provide Intel on whether that ship is friendly or hostile. If a bot runs away everytime another ship shows up on scan then you're going to have to have 1 ship per system.
---
oh? can you link the other one(s)?
---
CCP receives no money as PLEX is traded.
---
CCP receives cash when a PLEX is generated (but not income) and income (but not cash) when a PLEX is redeemed.  
---
Uber krabbers and SP farmers were not buying and using the loads of PLEX from CCP.  They were buying them from PVP'rs who were selling them for game isk.  So the real question is will they buy less at lower prices.  My guess is not.  They were the ones supplying the PLEX on market at all the previous lower prices.
---
link?
---
Right because info networks don't already exists with .
---
As a hunter you don't know if the person(s) in local are eyes for the corp, AFKers, or carebears.
---
Nothing substantial is going to change in regards to issues from big corp intel networks.
---
You aren‚Äôt entirely alone. Your ships have a crew.
---
And right there, in one simple change, CCP has made the umbrella only work if you have skill and coordination!  God bless if this is the case, i'm totally fine with it.
---
If an enemy shows up on their d-scan then they show up on the enemies d-scan.
---
How do you even get your pants on each day?
---
I think its weird you posted this and didnt run it through our Diplo.......
---
A free range is exactly what CCP should create. As much ships dying as possible should be the aim. Every ship dying is content for fleets of hundreds of people (at times) at the expense of one person. So it's exponentially good for the game.
---
"Effort" is not the question here. Hunting already takes way more effort than ratting.
---
The question is whether people will keep farming under those conditions. If CCP can make null riskier, but still keep it rewarding so people keep farming, then the ideal conditions would be achieved. Right now the risk is being increased by a lot without touching the reward, so people will either take steps to reduce the risk (move under umbrella regions), or they will dock/leave nullsec altogether.
---
Or warp in a slow warping ship and bookmark in the middle.
---
FUCK good call
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77496945/
---
Also, learn to scram.
---
Honestly I didn't even realize who it was until your comments. So no, try again.
---
&gt;*this game isn't easy enough for me*
---
Ugh, talk about embarrassing. I was lucky enough to have it returned.....the next day...
---
Then why do null blocs bring all the press/media to the game? Why are null blocks always the source of the major content creation in the game? Where do the large wars happen? Oh ya, null.  
---
I don't think null blocks are the problem at all. Yes, this game will never be as big some of the other MMO's but it's still a wicked fun game to play if it's your type of style.  
---
The problem, I think, is the constant toxic culture Reddit has about EVE. Let's take for example the removal of local in null (something I'm in favor of as is a lot of null). Most of the feedback during the announcement was high sec players or ex-players hoping it would kill the null blocks, not bring more content to them. That's toxic. Instead of relying on this delusional hope that CCP will help you fight the null blocks, fight the null blocks and stop bitching about us. Because we aren't going anywhere without a fight.
---
Yup - agreed.  Something that lets the little guy or a smaller PvP focused group get a bit of passive income, while also creating a possible focal point for content is a good thing in my book.  I've seen others suggest a passive citadel structure that either cannot extract the best moon goos, or only provides a small percentage of the goo that can be harvested actively as another option.
---
*Cries in Alpha struggling for one bil*
---
Actually, been months since I last played EVE, what's 500 PLEX now?
---
Hundreds (out) of thousands.
---
because people don't mine for minutes or even 10's of minutes
---
people also don't rat for minutes or even 10's of minutes.
---
These activity's take longer
---
so they will be the populated ones on the starmap/dotlan and people will know exactly where to go instead of , actually roaming
---
easy to bait as always!
---
I agree with most of this post.
---
If CCP changes local alone, this means they are increasing the risk immensely without buffing the reward. So a lot of people will either (1) will take steps to reduce the risk (moving under umbrella regions), or (2) will decide the reward is not worth it anymore (and move to other areas of space).
---
So if a local change is made, then countermeasures should be taken against (1), which means total available farm per region should be more limited, counters to cynoes should be implemented, and nerfs to supers/titans should be made. 
---
And then countermeasures should be taken against (2), which means isk/hr should be buffed.
---
Y'know, if you fleet up with enough people who agree, you could blow up the structure and anchor your own.
---
Was this entire thread bait?  Did you troll everyone?
---
Oh my
---
That is exatcly what he said. Isk and assets are worthless.
---
nullblocs provide better new player experiences than CCP.
---
Giving the asset safety tax to players instead of NPCs.
---
Sheckle fit. 
---
Check 
---
Bot more then likely. With nothing of value lost.
---
Awesome, so I can go around placing a good bounty on fighter pilots and no more suicide ganking. Just activate the 'killright' and kill them on behalf on CONCORD.
---
I like it.
---
Another reason why this is not a good idea:
---
Everytime you fire a weapon at a target the game has to calculate like 20 different factors including range, falloff and tracking between your ship and the target. However, there is no "vector" quantity for most weapons. It's just point A to point B. That's why you can shoot "through" other things in space. With this change you now have to add in an additional vector quantity for both the ship firing and the target. This adds even more calculations that have to be performed, and kind of throws a huge wrench in a lot of shit that the game just kind of ignores or assumes right now.
---
Not to mention this would be a humongous clusterfuck shitshow with missiles.
---
Yea, I agree with this and have been saying it as well. Let that 15 % be a loot drop, rather than percentage paid to unlock.
---

reinforcement timers on obvservatories as proposed defeat the purpose
---
Serms like your bot failed, own it up instead of lying.
---
Fuck joe Custer and fuck snuff
---
One leg at a time. Three legs and you are ready to start the day.
---
True, they'll likely be a requirement if you want any hope of catching a bot after they stop relying on local.
---
&gt;B) instant local gives a bot 30+ seconds to align and warp out. D-scan reduces that to between 5-10 seconds. Plenty of time to catch a carrier or super.
---
I'd have thought they'd rat aligned, but then I may be wrong, slightly less isk/hour if you warp back to safe each time.
---
&gt;C)d-scan doesn't provide Intel on whether that ship is friendly or hostile. If a bot runs away everytime another ship shows up on scan then you're going to have to have 1 ship per system.
---
I'd imagine there are whitelists or something you can use to get around this, like having an alt on the gate that reports the ships types of anything on grid/looks at the player info in the time between leaving gate cloak and activating your own cloak. If any of those ships appear on d-scan it's time for ratting bot to run? But that's just a theory. 
---
Either way, as another poster said, a form of anti-cheat would be much more effective. I don't think we should just assume bots will be gone because local is disappearing for a bit.
---
Make successful sov contests reward you with nudes from the CCP employee or your choice
---
Or make it so caps won't be able to obliterate subcaps much more effectively than other subcaps.
---
We saved a nyx in low armor about 40 minutes ago in delve that got Attacke by about 50 drifter.
---
There is no reason why third party apps should be able to warn players about incoming players by reading log files.
---
They recall when you jump?!
---
Shitbags baiting newbros happens all the time in newby systems.  The issue us, there are no actual hard coded blocks in place to prevent it from happening. And newbrows dont know that it is a bannable offense so they dont report it.  They just either A) log off and never come back, or B) leave the system and get on with their lives.
---
No just you &lt;3
---
What about a successful sov war resulting in random 1 to 5 citadels losing a shield timer for the next 24 hours and the armor timer coming up instead as a 24 hour vulnerability? Like big consequences for ignoring it?
---
Kinda unfair you guys get all the fun :(

If only they had a ship that used scripts to specify jamming things that they could add a cyno jammer script to that would make it possible to stop a ship from lighting a cyno...
---
&gt;If CCP changes local alone, this means they are increasing the risk immensely without buffing the reward. So a lot of people won't find the new risk/reward valuable. They will either (1) will take steps to reduce the risk (by moving under umbrella regions), or (2) will decide the reward is not worth it anymore (and move to other areas of Eve or completely quit).
---
This is a good point, I know myself and many people in corp like to grind towards Plex from time to time. Pretty difficult with 2bil+ for each month of omega, now it'll be even riskier with no local and drifters. 
---
I've heard from people who think CCP is trying to make it harder to earn your sub in game with drifters and now this. I personally don't think that's their plan, but I can see why some people think that way. Hopefully they buff the rewards to match the risk.

Frankly though, anyone that is shocked by the notion of TAPI leadership possessing the vertebral fortitude of Dictyostelium hasn't been paying attention for the last few years.

This is hot garbage.

Third party apps are just an extra. You usually recognize system names, especially close ones, when you have intel open, even before near2 pops up, then they can click and check route to see how far it is for a system name they do not recognize.
---
Remove near2 all you like, it's nothing to me, makes it more convenient to track spotting history, but I can do that manually pasting intel channel log into the file just as well.
---
My whole arguments is that all bot has to do is to copy intel channel every time there's a new entry, and then it'll just read the clipboard content, working as usual. So removing log files does absolutely nothing to bots, and just makes players manually copy  channel content into clipboard where 3rd party apps read it all the same, and they can be modified to automatically post to discord that does keep logs.
---
Thus removing logfiles does nothing, really. Are you fond of pretending to solve the problem by making changes that do not solve it?
---
heckin' frogs
---
Unfortunately for snuff, this is pretty much all the content that persists in Black Rise.  It's a dust-bowl, a wasteland bourne of years of over-farming and turbo blobbing without adequate understanding of how to obtain sustainable content.  These rorqs are just the most recent tool that snuff uses to try to subsist off the meager nutrients that still peek from the barren soil. 
---
You reap what you sow, and I'm pretty satisfied to see what Snuff now has to harvest.
---
The broker fees will rise until morale improves.
---
Just because of the nose?
---
i've been saying it for the last few days...
---
if you think supercap proliferation is a problem; these changes should horrify you.
---
supers are (were) the only thing capable of surviving long enough against drifters not to die in a fire - and by 'long enough' i mean long enough to cyno in a shitload more supers to save you. meaning it's supers or gtfo - which is basically going to accelerate the rate of proliferation most people are disgusted by.
---
Except when siphons showed up.
---
There's no limit on the number of accounts you can have.  The only limitation is how many you can be playing simultaneously (as many Omegas as you like, only one Alpha at a time, no Alpha if you have an Omega running).
---
Use the [Recruit a Friend](https://www.eveonline.com/recruit) program to create 4-5 new accounts and keep them alpha.  You don't get any rewards unless you sub them with real money, but at least it means that if you do sub one of them, you'll get the bonuses.
---
Once you've done that, start training them into stuff.  You don't need to be active with them them, just keep the training queue going, buying the skillbooks with the ISK you have with your main.
---
Train one for PvE.  Train a few for PvP.  Train one for Exploration.  Train one for Mining.  Train one for trade and hauling and industry.  A lot of the core skills will be shared between all your toons, but there will be specialisations you train into beyond that, unique to each character.  If you feel as though you want to try something new a few months down the line, you'll have another toon ready to become your new main for it.
---
If you join a null alliance like Pandemic Horde or Brave Newbies or Test Alliance Please Ignore (only go for this one if you're autistic), you could log your mining specialised toon when you want to hop on comms, shoot the shit, and blast some roids.  You can log your PvE ratting specialised toon when you want to keep to yourself, killing rats, while chilling out to some smooth jazz or liquid DnB.  And then when a call goes out for a fleet, you can log in your PvP specialised toon and whelp some free ships in to those dirty gankers that want to trash the little corner of space you and your alliance call home.
---
Download and install [EVEMon](https://github.com/peterhaneve/evemon/releases/tag/4.0.12) to keep track of them all, optimising your skill plans by matching the attributes required to skills to your attribute remaps.

A proper delayed chat would probably be the best thing and I was pretty disappointed that their version of "Delayed" isn't actually delayed.

A proper delay adds more risk without copying existing mechanics and leaves new decisions and strategies on the table.

Claiming all out semites do not abide to their word is racist!
---
Fuck yea it was
---
Super ratting was a mistake, glad that you actually need an alliance now to protect what should be an alliance level asset.
---
6. Introduction of Keepstars because now owning a super is a lot less of a hassle.
---
Depends on if you plan to use the alts to PLEX accounts. Remember every account = \~2 Billion Isk now. That's 4 Billion ISK just to stay at par... which is more or less a full-time job. Ratting is no longer really viable with bounties not increasing with PLEX prices. Yeah a high-end Nyx ratter could do it in fairly decent time, but with the Blackout, kiss that idea goodbye. Rorq mining as well. A high-skilled Rorq pilot with 1 or 2 Hulk alts can cover the costs with time to to spare each month to enjoy other aspects but that is assuming you don't get afk-cloaky camped or outright ganked. Again, with Blackout, this option is off the table as well. 
---
However, if you plan on playing Eve with a CC, then fuck it all. Load up that thing with pixel-debt.

Plenty of goons are just high seccers who realized null was the new high sec.
---
O neat, a video showing everything wrong with Snuff and what it's done to low sec. Those solo t1 cruisers sure put up a fight worthy of a video.
---
I'd suggest you try growing some balls and going after content that can actually fight back, but then I remember it's Snuff I'm talking to.
---
Fleet warped maybe?
---
That used to happen right when Citadels were introduced, ships would sometimes warp by themselves, empty, to the last gate you jumped through. Or yes, even appeared at the sun, this one time I saw a VG sabre in the sun with nobody else in local, but when I combatscanned and warped to it, I got bounced out before I could board. None of the guildmates knew how it got there.
---
removing local isn't new, nor are the drifters at this point.
---
we've had local removed before - so lol at them doing that again.
---
and the drifters are old hat now, they've been around long enough.
---
The gila stuff seems cool man. I just need to get skills till i can do the gila? What skill points for drones and missiles?
---
meh
---
I like it, but if the blackout goes long expect folks to start running out of ships (especially T2).
---
Yep
---
I'm afraid that's not rly smt you can rely on.
---
Fuck no. Take links away from anything that isn't a command ship first. Or totally redesign commands and make titans and supers command only. Or give ONLY commands their off grid boost back.
---
Yeah but do they undock as well
---
Best one yet onion good work!
---
There's no law saying I need to pay my taxes!!!1!

This is the least relevant possible reply

Was this back when that 300-400 million bought you 60 days sub rather than 30?
---
not a bad idea actually
---
Because Anslo fed my Neo moon to NOC
---
Back in my day sonny we had to watch out for mines on the way to null school.  You blue donutters are soft!
---
So reading your inane comments here:
---
Why do you feel like you should be able to roam and gank in actively defended space with impunity?
---
Why are you advocating for changes and increased risk in Null but are unwilling to shoulder any yourself?
---
If you're going to bitch about getting counter-dropped whenever you initiate a PvP encounter in the targets' home, you should pick your targets better or be prepared with a counter-drop of your own. If you can't contest it, then you should accept that you are punching above your weightclass and will lose often.
---
Risk is not just for one class of players.
---
1) Make sovereignty less of a pain in the ass.
---
2) Stop making NPCs randomly decide to reinforce structures so that people can focus on moving assets to battle.
---
3) Escalate capital and supercapital presence. Allow a fixed amount of supercapital ships per alliance or corp per system by default and require that one or more of them be engaged in combat with another supercapital for some fixed amount of time before other supercapital ships can jump into the system. Apply the same rule for capital ships but with a higher starting amount and a lower amount of time to escalate.
---
4) Remove moon mining from highsec. Make people fleet up and work together and with PvPers if they want to play with big boy ores. Pirates attack miners, defenders attacks pirates, pirates reinforce, defense reinforces, and it escalates. You don't see that in highsec.
---
5) Make highsec ore anomalies more rare. Same reason as above, it makes lowsec belts nucleation sites for combat.
---
What is dscan
---
There are a lot of things that will get you killed outside of a super umbrella, this pilot is essentially relying entirely on the umbrella to not die
---
* Not having a prop mod to quickly align
---
* Not aligning to anything for rather long periods of time
---
* Warping to sites at predictable distances and angles
---
* Running NSA instead of 2xSebo's
---
* Ratting with 11 blue's in local
---
Other things that trigger me
---
* Not using hotkeys to control fighters
---
* Having NSA on the first row so F1 will activate it if you accidentally select your ship
---
* If you are that close to the rock haven anyways you can keep your heavy fighters next to your super for better tracking and quick recall, requires a bit more micro as the "return and orbit" hotkey goes to all fighters instead of just selected fighters
---
You don't get it. Buys for ALL items get placed in perimeter by anyone smart. It hits jita too. Only have to sell most things in jita. Smart buyer always offshores.
---
Yes, they could be docked at one moment, and then just appear somewhere else in the system the next. Although I haven't heard about it happening for quite a while now.
---
Oh jeeze. Oh darn it.  You can't rake in ISK in complete safety. That's real bummer, bro.
---
they shouldn't auto aggro at all, ever.
---
This.
---
The drifter horseshit actually actively hindered the war, though; everything was basically on hold during that shitfest.  Wonderful way to increase PVP, CCP.
---
removing local was still not enough? this is really getting pathetic...
---
Cant forget the poop sock as well.
---
If your suggestion requires a lot of coding, it won't be implemented by CCP.
---
If your suggestion still allows a super-block of players to congregate and protect each other, they will.  If they have to spread, or fight amongst themselves for resources, fractures MIGHT form, or they will figure out ways to shar.
---
A source of conflict must include the ability for a smaller entity to take advantage of shifts in defenses.  If the fortress can hold all, including the farms, no one will leave it and no one will assault the walls.  If the farms have to be outside the fortress, and if moving the army to one side of the empire exposes the other side to conquest (and entrenching) then perhaps you will have a conflict.
---
Heyyy.... We better be getting our cut.
---
I played six years without making any alts, until three days ago when I made a carrier pilot so I could use them in lowsec drops and baiting. My main character can fly everything in the game pretty damn well, and even do a fair bit of industry to boot. Alts aren't required by any means, but they can make your game easier. For example, one of the biggest reasons I made a carrier alt when my main already has near perfect skills is because I live in wormholes, so I can't easily switch between the two. 
---
Take some time, find some stuff you enjoy, and determine if you really want to invest the time and money into making a second character to do both, or if you can do both on one account. Specialisation helps speed up training, but variety is the spice of life. Enjoying EVE means a balancing act between the two, and you may very well decide like I did that you want to do a little bit of everything. 
---
At one week in the game, you still have a lot to try out, and not to be pessimistic, but a lot of people still don't play past the first few weeks. By all means, I hope that you do and that you come to find things you enjoy, but it's definitely a good idea to find your groove and decide for sure if you're going to stay around before investing in more than one character. 
---
Fly dangerous, newbro.
---
Caldari Cruiser and Gallente Cruiser to get into it. Drones will be your main source of DPS, so training for T2 medium drones is recommended, but you can start out using faction drones while training the drone support skills up a bit. 
---
If you are in any of the big new player friendly alliances, they should have forum posts or corp fittings for ratting ships that can get you started on what all you would need. 
---
Training into a VNI first, isn't a bad idea, it's worse than it used to be, but if you don't have the cash to inject all the way into a gila, you can start to make some isk with the VNI while your other skills train.
---
In my experience cloakers are there expressly to damage long term industrial efforts by making the miners have to be extra cautious because they know he's there. The entire system is basically compromised.
---
I don't really welcome this change... but I'm not really opposed to it either. Null has been so stale that almost anything to make goons and us, hordelings, undock and fight is good.
---
And I'm certainly very happy that CCP has realized that null is problematic, and it needs a cure. Badly.
---
Needed the chuckle for the day.
---
remove AS of course
---
Start convo &gt; "Hey can I fly with you guys for a bit?"
---
Not as pathetic as your reply
---
What's it like being the bad guy in a Disney Channel home movie?
---
Wouldn‚Äôt change bots just afk ratting.
---
They way drones and stabs function currently is complete ASS.
---
I¬¥d just delete boats completely from the game, but that¬¥s just me.
---
Problem is with the Drifters behaving like this Super ratting happens to be the only safe way of making isk.  Carriers are already dying to them.  If Drifters keep spawning like this when local goes out all those people ready to start roaming Null for PvP better be ready to find absolutely nothing undocked, and get killed by Drifters instead.
---
Pretty bold comment putting eve players and girlfriends in the same sentence...
---
A merge don't means 0.0 become WH.
---
You take some part of WH like npc and no local (and no asset safety who will be announced soon for 0.0 i think). You have a 0.0  with some WH part, and ccp could just said 'ok 0.0 bear adapt, no WH bear nead to adapt to some 0.0 thing ' and it's done .
---
TEST goes to war with Horde in high sec with the objective being to take away Horde's monopoly on the PLEX broker fee market. 
---
War ends with a TEST Keepstar remaining in high sec and agreement between the parties to split revenue.
---
&gt; 1) Test 'lose' a highsec war of attrition to PH.
---
Makes ya think.
---
Then,
---
&gt; 2) PH gain a % of the broker fee generated by TTT.
---
Well actually as a reuslt of this war TEST 'lose' Horde actually lose their majority share of the Broker Fee market on PLEX.
---
Point 3 isn't worth refuting because it nonsense when taken in the context of what actually happened described above.
---
I'd be sad to not see brisc on our sns if yas left,  so sorry can't go
---
Hey can someone clue me in on what OP means? Did they drop a patch with some good changes recently? Thanks!
---
Wormholes are a great way to get into scanning (good way to make lots of easy ISK) and small gang PVP. Spoopy Newbies out the Brave Collective (Brave Newbies) is a great spot for new players aspiring to fly the unfriendly skies. 
---
As a wormholer from day one myself, I can tell you that it might not be as stable or as high profile as the null blobs, but after six years I'm yet to get a fight that doesn't leave my hands shaking.
---
Plus Spoopy Newbies always gives us good fights so there's that.
---
No i'm not evicted from anywhere.
---
Consider first person hud off?
---
That the correct answer sir
---
Supers shouldn¬¥t be able to rat. Period.
---
Problem solved.
---
If you don¬¥t like the Drifters you could do one of the other X activities that make ISK instead of shooting red crosses.
---
Would need to be able to steal ore from Atharnors in low and null.
---
Both more than likely. If no name companies can figure out how to do anti cheat then so could CCP. They earn money when botters plex and you already know they are too lazy to incorporate test results in expansions when they are released.
---
So you want to see the pilot names of the ships leaving? Just want to make sure I understand completely.
---
Not with that attitude. 
---
Whenever I miss I like to imagine my gunnery crew is getting paid slightly less if we survive this.
---
Bots cant tell if someone on dscan is friend or foe.
---
All these tools (except killmails) have a significant delay. They are imo fine to use by both hunters and defenders as they do not provide any abusive intel. They give hints as to what‚Äôs probably going on but are not giving any real time info (except cynos but that‚Äôs kinda logical and balanced since the ability to jump across the map is so op otherwise). Killmails kinda are almost real time intel sadly but while I personally agree that the game would be better without killboards they are so popular that I doubt players are ready to see them go. Having a bit of delay on them could be a compromise.
---
Yup! or 
---
&gt; How did you kill me? What could I have done to survive?
---
What did you prefer? Anaconda or Python?
---
My Corp and i were talking about this.  a common comment was to have corps/alliances to build a structure that would be "local" controlled by the alliance/corp. which also could be attacked/hacked and brought down. or turned off for a amount of time.    this was just a discussion tho.
---
If you think a flair define a person, think again.
---
Still waiting on my hoody, I already poured one out for the hat :(
---
Nope that was the ETC right? Eve time cards? They were sold on forums for like 7-800m.
---
PLEX itself was 3-500m for 1, which was all you needed
---
They've dropped local in null
---
I want AT back.
---
&gt; we've had local removed before - so lol at them doing that again.
---
Not in the past 12 years we haven't, and so much has changed, that if they did it prior to then, it's not even remotely relevant, considering the game is entirely different, as is the landscape of null.
---
And sometimes the answer is going to be, "Honestly? Nothing."
---
Because sometimes you just can't win. But even then, I like to send the guys I blap with my Loki off with a smack on the ass and some money for a new ship, because death happens in this game and the sooner you learn to improve when you can and move on when you can't, the better you are at the game.
---
Drones should not auto-attack at all
---
They‚Äôre going to deliberately do what they‚Äôve been accidentally doing for yrs now. They‚Äôre going to remove local.
---
still better then the 240 goons vs 40 inner hell one
---
What is your characters name, where do you mine and what times do you usually play?
---
It can. You can do it much cheaper, the thing is though you want the buffer to disconnect or have close calls and stuff and not die. If you use a 2b fit, and disconnect you probably lose it. With the super blinged fits, you have like 5-6minutes to reconnect
---
&gt; Not in the past 12 years we haven't
---
yes we fucking have, multiple times. 
---
the new chat system saw to that.
---
And that tech right there, is what runs Tranquility.
---
But he'll also develop loads of bad habits and a false sense of competency.
---
All while not training the skills that will be beneficial to his pvp career.
---
Don't say the quiet thing out loud!
---
thanks for the detailed reply, Im not familiar with how fast the dps ramps up but I suspected that might be the case, though I imagined there might be a way to work with smartbombs for frigates and drones
---
Alas, the one area of kspace you can't just drop two hundred titans on
---
I GAVE IT TO ATLAS AT EVE VEGAS
---
There's normally always SOMETHING.
---
Even being caught by your loki, the battle was being fought before you tackled them.
---
yep lol grrrr RAGE QUIT
---
They've been doing it accidentally? Also, thank you. That sounds like a change everyone can appreciate.
---
I'm not talking about viability of Super ratting. With Drifters behaving like this (60 landing on a Super) NOTHING will be able to undock and PVE except for Supers, which Subcaps can't deal with.  From what we can tell Subcaps are getting blapped first, so even if you roam and try to land on Supers fighting drifters you are gonna die.
---
Keep in mind that everything but cynos is delayed by up to 30mins and even more for indexes. They are merely hints.
---
The problem is that they can't even get normal local working 100%.  You really think they could make a timed mechanic actually work properly?
---
OMG My network died just a sec before I posted this. I would have been so mad.
---
Fun article tbf.
---
hot hot hot!
---
Join Pandemic Horde, Brave Newbies or Brand Newbros. They give you ships and fights. Hang out on comms, let people get to know you. Don‚Äôt be afraid to throw your frigate at everything that moves.
---
If it's a real Blackout could be interesting. 
---
For a first iteration time ihub is alive let to have owner information when you are in the system (or one gate before with the logo on the gate). 
---
So everyonne will need to make his own map.
---
Don't flatter yourself. Your comments are usually just that stupid, and difficult to distinguish between whether they're a joke or you're simply retarded, that many of your downvotes are likely just random people reading through.
---
Goons and panfam each get a vote. Test gets a vote. 2v1 voted to raise taxes.
---
Not enought titans to destory lowsec.
---
Holy crap I didn‚Äôt know about the KM delay, that‚Äôs awesome.
---
Awesome vid Edeity!! The salt farming has been going well for TMOC!
---
&gt; actively defended space with impunity
---
1) If you are actually actively defending a space, then I am not able to gank with impunity.
---
&gt; Risk is not just for one class of players.
---
The kind of risk we talk about is exactly for one class of players. Eve is inherently designed in a way that PvE and moneymaking are used to create a motivation for farmers to take risks, and at times die. The game by design create risks for farmers. Hunters take emergent risks like getting baited. They don't take risks imposed by game design, because they are not making money off the environment that's supposed to be risky.
---
&gt; punching above your weightclass
---
If access to ganks in your space protected with 1000 titans is moving my own 1000 titans, then that makes the largest titan blob immune to ganks. That kind of design makes Eve too stagnant, blocks content, cause players to leave. That's what CCP is trying to steer the game away from. The kind of null privilege and entitlement you feel to riskless farm, just because you happened to join the largest alliance, is something you should HTFU and give up.
---
Actually, test gets a vote, goons get a vote, and pan fam gets a vote. Panfam and goons wanted to raise taxes as part of operation fuck high sec to teach ccp a lesson. Test wanted to keep 0.3% Majority won.
---
Alpha toons can go up to battleship hulls now in case you did not know
---
Snuff only ever do this trash. But don‚Äôt get why they live out of low sec??
---
Your wormhole experience means exactly DICK, because Nullhole 2.0 won't have any of the mechanics that make wormholes work.
---
Rus rus generally refers lto Russians, which were a bloc in nullsec. Blopsing is using black ops, battleships a t2 battleship that can fit a jump drive generator, to gank people
---
Lower broker fees so nice for plex and injectors and high value. Tether is also the tits. No blap tornados on undock.
---
no becuase test is full of dog shit and vily literally lied about what he said...  point blank lied... thats why noone uses the damn keepstar lol...
---
Print next one from the clear material, and mix up some https://www.amazon.com/Black-Thermochromic-Pigment-Changes-Fahrenheit/dp/B01AE8CVYU with some epoxy and paint the printed model, and you have a cov-ops ship that can "cloak" when the heat is on.
---
Oh okay, thanks! So can you clear it up for me? What does using black ops battleships and killing russians have to do with the amount of systems in null security?
---
CCP has mentioned the idea of forward operating bases as a replacement for POS towers. I look forward to seeing those in C13 space.
---
Yikes
---
I opened the twitch and saw the rear end of a Scorpion and thought that it was you until someone bumped it away. xD
---
Yah in the past year or so they changed over their chat service from one to another and made a few big changes. So the game seemed to log you in and then log you in again to another chat server. That chat server was ‚Äúlocal‚Äù and when they originally came out with it, it did what was expected of a CCP game patch and it broke the game. I remember traveling through some random hisec system and local would say I was in a different system which made me invisible to the local I was actually in, another thing that would happen would be the chat server would be down altogether. You wouldn‚Äôt even be able to see who was in the same fleet as you unless you looked at the squads. You couldn‚Äôt see chat or anything. It was broken beyond WH space. For the first day or so of it there would be a lot of krabs that just didn‚Äôt even log into Eve with the locals broken. Eventually they started to trickle back in though as it would take CCP days and even weeks to fix the chat problems. Then sometimes even after it was ‚Äúfixed‚Äù you‚Äôd still jump a gate and local wouldn‚Äôt load for you and you‚Äôd once again be invisible in that local space. It was glorious as long as you didn‚Äôt have to go into another local and it would sometimes reconnect you and spook the miners and ratters and cause the bots to go hide in their POS.
---
Thats piracy. When I hear and talk about war I mean lots of ships shooting each other for the sake of shooting
---
Ahh no worries mate yeah if I do catch it on stream I normally try to make sure the terrorist I mean camera blockers don‚Äôt win!
---
LOL, if you think CCP well plans ANYTHING, you either have been asleep for the last 5 years, or have very clean windows at home.
---
Thats fine, as long as they actually start banning bots in significant fashion
---
ten outta ten !
---
Best shitpost I've seen in awhile. Take my Invite sir.
---
Wow that was brutal ! This is some elite Onion shit !
---
Moa using rail guns works.
---
&gt; Apparently a Bhaalgorn can destroy ~3,123,000 Big Macs in a single neut cycle.
---
turns out blood raiders are americans after all
---
As I've stated here before, this would not stop botting, only afking. What is stopping the bot from manually targeting and pressing "f"? 
---
Nothing.
---
If the goal is to stop all afk ratting, this would work, but an effective way to stop botting - I think we all wish it was this easy.
---
Can you expand on that that? What are people baiting new players into? Do you think that this has a large impact? I agree anything that would make a new player stop or quit is bad, just trying to understand the scope.
---
&gt; I haven't met a nullsec who doesn't need to go to high sec.
---
&gt;Every player goes back to high sec. Show me one of those players you know without a high sec jump clone. You can't.
---
Those were your literal words. A player in null does get some influence from those in highsec as well as how a highsec player does from null. However, your initial argument was that a player always needs to go back to highsec for whatever reason, which is why you had this backlash from those that don't interact with highsec and stay in null.
---
See above. Got caught on the first day.
---
If titans were the way they used to be, sure. I'd love to be able to dock inside of supers. 
---
Problem is, everyone and their cat's four Alta has a super these days. They need to be smashed with a Nerf jackhammer, not buffed.
---
I am not entirely sure they're more than tangentially related. The more (active) systems there are, I assume the more spread out people are so the target environment is less dense. So harder to find people to drop on. 
---
Theres always been the same amount of systems, but itd be cool if they changed that around
---
Remove infinite anomalies and make security status increase as rats die.
---
&gt; Blah blah blah, more words nobody cares about, blah blah. 
---
I'm sensing a pattern here.
---
It's too many people being blinded by the allure of easy killmails on ratters, without bothering to remember that those ratters have human brains behind them and they are going to be measuring Risk/Reward.
---
Eh first two weeks will be interesting after the adaptation should kick in. For most of the ratters/miners be on coms and easily find the safe fleet and you may live.
---
Get rid of cynos entirely. Make caps jump to a celestial and warp in. This gives subcaps a window to do their thing before the caps dominate the field.
---
He means p4 factory setups.
---
The lock time penalty from the stabs. How many times did you get dropped on your head to get your reading comprehension so bad?
---
And you've got the numbers on how many nobodies are using it correct? I don't have a dog in this fight honestly, I just think the constantly shifting echo chamber of reeing in this sub is hilarious from week to week and you seem to be supporting my point.
---
Still waiting for those Heron, Imicus and Kestrel redesigns we saw years ago.
---
Slow morning Joe?
---
fighter ratting was 100% viable when they changed DDAs to affect drones and was worth 150-180m/hr, sentries were more popular because they were afk and scalable. But yea, time was the big factor, plus back then alot of groups were very particular about people using capitals for PvE
---
&gt;Any citadel that restores full nullsec local seems a big 180 from what ~~they are trying to achieve~~ a faction of r/Eve wants.
---
FTFY.  One of the things about CCP not commenting on what they're doing is none of us actually know what they're trying to achieve.
---
He's referring to the entire factory planet setup as a p4 factory. It's not a mistake, it's just a lack of clarity
---
Shots fired. From 1400s.
---
That alone would have done nothing to break the economy if not for it being combined with larger and larger coalitions making rorqs perfectly safe to use. That's not on CCP. It would have gone terrible with slightly more accounts mining in other ships or just more ratting alts instead of a split over ratting and mining.
---
If you have the opportunity to steal or lose a 10b purse, you might get fights.
---
Bad trolling.
---
Mind blown.
---
Best bet right now is to use the strength 2 warp inhibs and ramming speed.
---
Isk isnt worthless. It gets you more ship for your money than before, with the exception of tech 2 due to revisions to moon mining and some other items.
---
He doesnt discuss powercreep, but the buying power of isk, and there he is wrong
---
Supercarriers were 240m-300m/hr once DDAs and tracking links affected fighters, but most groups were very anti the use of supers for PvE. When I was in Razor though we weren't allowed to use our supercaps for PvP unless pappa goon said we could log them in, and there were quite a few people with them, so most just ratted
---
Moa with rails or a speed tanked caracal. When I get home I can get some fittings
---
&gt; And what about Outpost stuff? They're still selling the book...
---
You mean Outpost Construction? That skill is required to build upwell structures.
---
No the rorqs by themselves are the problem here. Plus CCP made them insanely hard to kill with or with out an umbrella defending them. Rorqs are the problem, and in addition enabled the mega coalition growth by making it possible to cram 30k or more characters into a region, not the other way around.
---
&gt;*reeeeeeeeeeeeee reeeee reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee*
---
ftfy
---
stop being such a whiny bitch and fit more scrams.
---
 Bad
---
Salt?
---
What? No.
---
As 95% or more of the null players are carebears you have to introduce a system that threatens their income heavily if they don't go to war. A carebear will never go to war when they could happily krab.
---
Maybe!! I don‚Äôt think CCP is lousy, you have to admit that the game they have created is great, and is very difficult to satisfy so many different interests: Goons, Test, PL, the Russians, Bombers, HiSockers, Lowsockers, WHs... and the Botters, cheaters and Whales! Maybe you think the triglavians were just placed there on a weekend, a splurge, a rare miracle brainstorming!!
---
But hey! I run a software company and your comment sounds so childish when it comes to software development...  design, testing and deploying changes is a though task... and CCP is showing balls and rattling the cage!!
---
Wake up! Play EVE, don‚Äôt login to braindead yourself watching Netflix or Pornhub while you mine in your rorq...
---
CCP finances are not like other companies, and I admire a team that has kept the game live for so many years!
---
Respect!!!
---
God dayum. #Tyrannosaurus rekt
---
Me too little man
---
Because if they tried to do it in null they'd have to either blue half the game or lose all their shit when they realise null alliances can bring more than t1 cruisers to fight titans.
---
That still has to happen. soon‚Ñ¢
---
Apparently you don't know who all have their hands in the jar.
---
If the problem we have is so much content that PvPers are running out of ships then they‚Äôve fixed the game
---
Since Eve's economy is market driven it will self adjust to price in the new risk.   Nullsec ratting right now is a massive isk faucit, 10x more isk comes in that way than any other.   It's why plexing an account costs 2 billion when it used to cost 1 billion.
---
What‚Äôs your ISK range? I‚Äôd go with a passive shield RLML Caracal, assuming you completed the career agents and skilled up Caldari ships and missiles.
---
Fit the highs with meta rapid light missile launchers with kinetic ammo. Meta large shield extenders and a meta kinetic + thermal hardener for mids + meta afterburner. T2 ballistic control system in lows if you can, if not just use meta. Purgers for rigs. Two Hornets in drone bay.
---
Since it‚Äôs an escalation you very likely don‚Äôt have to worry about someone taking your site, so time is not as important as staying alive. T2 the tank mods as you skill up, from there you can adjust which tank mods you want to keep. 
---
Total you should be spending a bit less than 20mil for the fit.
---
Soon when you skill up enough and don‚Äôt worry about tank as much as wanting to complete sites in less amounts of time, switch out tank mods for DPS (more BCU instead of shield relay or DC) and T2 launchers. By that time you should be investing in more capable ships (Gila is flyable as alpha and is a DED god)
---
If you have other questions feel free to ask.
---
Best of luck!
---
Lurk more
---
I dont think this idea will even last 2 weeks. Within the first week I suspect players numbers to be down around half or so of the normal amount.
---
Auto aggro was to counter ECM.  Now you can just shoot the jammer regardless.  Auto-aggro needs to go.
---
I miss homeworld. Was a damn fine piece of gaming.
---
So you think only 5 % of the game generates their entire isk income through plex purchases?
---
So god damn much this ^
---
Some would say that, but some miners might disagree. (Can‚Äôt mine cause they get ganked, can‚Äôt build without ore)
---
Delete Supers and Titans reimburse the minerals.
---
when snuff post something one thing you can be sure is that mikal will post his tears kek
---
I think it‚Äôs trying to communicate
---
All this effort just so you need even more Rorqual Alts to hold SOV and limit NPC null usability to Carebears?  
---
If the thing gets the ability to send a de-cloaking EMP over the system to counter campers i might approve.  
---
But it can't be so much effort to keep up that smaller alliances are left out and in that case it woudn't affect the big ones at all.  
---
I predict this change won't stay long.  
---
Fleet PVP will go to shit because FCs can't judge fleet sizes and will hesatate to engage anything at all.  
---
Walers won't find targets because all carebears get Highsec incurstion alts instead.  
---
Miners will finally grow enough brain to have some insta locking shit for catching booshers on grid. (for shure!)  
---
And a whole lot of so called PVPers will rage quit while trying to finally figure out how to use D-Scan propperly and failing miserably...
---
Or (3) They realize even with the added risk, the risk/reward is still alright because the reward was too high to begin with.
---
&gt;Region lock moon goo.
---
Incentives to trade do not drive war.  They drive peace.
---
Everyone needs all of the moongoos to make T2 stuff because of how CCP put goos into the components.  So if you're in the South, you need to buy Northern goo.  If you're in the North, you need to buy Southern goo.
---
Option 1) You attempt to conduct regular mining operations deep within enemy territory.  Not gonna happen.
---
Option 2) You conquer the entire map.  Not gonna happen.
---
Option 3) You do what happens IRL: you trade your goo for their goo.
---
Which means you now depend on those folks on the other end of the galaxy, and they depend on you.  So you're not going to fight, you're going to keep trading so that you both keep access to the other's goo.
---
Stellaris is fun as fuck. I'll take that comparison.
---
Oh boy, increasing the targeting time for a BS in a haven from 4 seconds to 6 seconds. Bots eliminated!
---
Oooor.... every bot starts to fit an auto targeter. Bots are back!
---
Next CCP name should be CCP Redacted.
---
NO ITS CLEARLY A CONSPIRACY AGAISNT HIM
---
Here, let me simplify for you.
---
Just wait, if the blackout goes long, look at t2 prices, don‚Äôt bitch.
---
Y'know, a Cynosaural Inhibitor Script isn't the most bad idea. We'd probably have to deal with it being a module or something, and knowing CCP it'd get locked to a hull same as a MJFG or HIC goodies.
---
Not too much. Occasionally there will be some action down the high class static but we mainly roll it for a logistics chain to look for a high sec or other k-space.
---
I support adding local in WH space
---
I want to see which artist has the balls to dare tackle the Rifter. I still remember the outrage at the (excellent, imo) designs for the Thrasher.
---
Atron does look good, though it's Caldari redesigns I'm looking forward to.
---
"oh my god please kill my wreck, that ship was from the secret santa and I don't want that on my killboard"
---
Just because you're a nobody doesn't mean everybody is, pubbie.
---
It is the only reason we post.
---
Reminder that bots aren't players XD
---
Give it 3-6 months, there will not be a 4-4.
---
I remember going into an Abyssal pocket from null-space and suddenly being in Jita local chat.
---
I can't see the B274 in the photo.  Is it off to the side?
---
Either go null or go low sec. Dont be a bitch and try bully black rise alliances when most of them know the bitch tactic of mass dropping cruiser gangs and most of them don‚Äôt care
---
&gt;Region locking moon goo to an extent would help a little bit.
---
Good news!  High end moon goo is already region locked.
---
Problem is you need their goo and they need your goo.  So you just trade because it's way simpler than conquering the whole map or conducting regular mining operations in enemy space.
---
He's right though. The guy making the claim is the one who has burden of proof. You're making yourself look like an idiot.
---
HOLY MOTHER OF GOD WHY IS IT SO LOUD
---
Skill combat, both used in pve and pvp
---
Hi OP, I think I'm actually the type to help you out with this. DM me. I'm the kind of person who plays the playstyle you're trying to reach.
---
What's it like being the bad guy in a Hallmark Channel home movie?
---
*took a break for 6 months
---
Thank you very much.
---
&gt;Nullsec ratting right now is a massive isk faucit, 10x more isk comes in that way than any other. It's why plexing an account costs 2 billion when it used to cost 1 billion
---
Thought it was Rorqs? Or did that stop being the narrative when they were nerfed? Or skill farms driving up Plex prices, plenty of people blame those too.
---
Best. Track. Ever.
---
As if a double stab myrm isn't a thing
---
Much in the same boat, but I'm too leery to take the leap just yet. CCP has so consistently fucked up everything for a damn decade now that I'm going to wait and see how they cock this up.
---
But their alt at a gate can, and it can see what the friend/foe is flying.
---
Those moons carried like a sense of soverignty and pride. Little of this isk trickled down but it felt good to know you owned the isk in your enemies yard.
---
we've got a bunch of publicly available knowledge. we're not starting from zero here.
---
the claim here is "your reasonable conclusion from all the public information is wrong", soooooooooo
---
Waifu pillows, man.
---
How does highsec "support" null? Mining? Lmao, yeah, the nullblocs are totally dependent on those orcas and retrievers mining veldspar.
---
Will have to see. As a member of imperium and avid miner I‚Äôll be losing out on excavatior yield for t2 mining drones as the only thing I worry about is the drone booshers or bombers.
---
it was because of embezzled and passive bad men
---
yeah I saw it - on a gate it looks like l o l
---
&gt;in fact part of the reason why eve is so stagnant is there's no real hate anymore. all the alliance leadership are kind of chummy, we hang out in the same discords, there's little feints back and forth sometimes but no one is willing to just put it all on the line to burn someone down because they want to see them gone anymore.

Yes, it is a totally different thing
---
Resource scarcity. Cut back the ammount of materials and ISK getting into the system, and restore the risk/reward balance.
---
great video, thank you joe
---
well with the removal of local there is no more cloaky camping
---
Damn I'm going to have to resub now
---
Ehhhh
---
this is a real schrodinger mystery

I had to downvote your lack of furthering the conversation. But the random ‚Äúeat my asshole‚Äù got me.
---
"And this dial here is where we turn Spruillo's DED loot drops down to ammo only for an entire year lol."
---
New probe type that scans only cloaked ships. Can be purchased with Blood Raider tags in NPC Delve only.
---
This would also require an active system security value, changing with the military index of the system.
---
For example: if you farm a -1.0 sec system, your military index for this system will grow, and also security status should increase, to -0.5, and if you farm hard, all the way up to 0.0.
---
lowest investment and best Isk/Hour early might just be Gassing. Venture, ninja gas decent clouds (look at price for certain gases where reactions are climbing) like C540/C320/C84/C32 and you can make decent isk (albeit you have to Dscan like a mofo in WH space)
---
Wh'er BTW...also, I'll buy the gas :)
---
It's in front as he's re-approaching rapidly.

Better yet.....make warp stabs have a drone bandwidth penalty. 25% per stab. Win win. Sure stab your ships....and fuck your dps.

---
Thanks injectors :(
---
Yonis still alive?
---
I am not a fan of your idea but maybe something different could be done. Why not completely change the cyno inhibitor to a high slot module and then you can target a ship with it and prevent a cyno from being lit. The down side of this is that only a cyno or cyno inhib can be fitted to a ship. With recons being able to fit both. Also if you use this module you turn off the other ships mod instantly. That way its not first to light wins but more play counter play
---
What a great way to double your ISK.
---
Ratting generated isk while rorquals do not

I often go to jita and ram the pirates and gankers into the station. I like to see how well they are paying attention, plus it may save someone's freighter. I do so in an overprop slicer
---
&gt; Within the first week I suspect players numbers to be down around half or so of the normal amount.
---
Some people also expected hillary to win in 2016 with a 90%+ landslide. 
---
Neither prediction seems remotely realistic.
---
Congrats on your one week bad for wasting my time with your stupid report.
---
Oh man. Can you imagine the salt?
---
Why do Sleepers do the same thing? Why do Drifters do the same thing?
---
It could also be rationalized as "we are losing the most ground in these systems, so they need the most reinforcements".
---
God bless this change, so that people who put effort and numbers on the table can get those resources, and not people who cna only scare the entire game with a bunch of supers and titans.

With my skills and factoring in shoddy reload time you‚Äôre looking at 158 DPS, which sounds pretty low (it‚Äôll be around 140 for you) but if you look at damage application the regular scourge lights &amp; hornets will nab anything that gets in the way. You‚Äôre also able to hit at quite some range (55km with my skills). And once you T2 the lights and drones and skill up you‚Äôll end up around the 250 DPS ballpark.
---
Your tank is a meager 75 EHP/S with 63% thermal resist and 72% kinetic resist which is why its so important to T2 your tank mods ASAP to bring that number up and have you soaking damage like a boss.
---
I won't. I would love for T2 to be a rarity again.
---
Skill extraction killed some of the stratification we had once before. It'll be better this way.
---

Either the timing on this post is great or someone fixed this ages ago and forgot to push it to live status because more important things came up and this post reminded them they had it.
---
Fake news - there's no hamsters running the server in the background.
---
I love how this game just draws people back into it. People literally  can just into any other game as a time sink.. but when it comes to eve... we have to mentally prepare for it... 
---
Also, like the saying goes "no one quits eve, we just take breaks."
---
I've had a FW alt for ages, flew galmil, so naturally it was blasters all day
---
I would be concerned. Sounds like a password change is in order to say the least. Change your email password as well and took a virus scan.
---
They don't, when you farm a system in a wormhole the anoms come back after a while but they don't come back faster the more you farm them.
---
You can gas in null as well, and I recommend you hook up with a bigger group like Brave, TEST, or Goons or whatever, and they'll likely have a gas-purchasing service at the home station, making things a lot simpler.
---
I liked gassing a lot. It's safer than mining in null, because you'd have to be scanned down to get ganked, and if you're feeling adventurous, you can hop into a WH and grab some of the rarer stuff.
---
What does it matter what they trade in?  
---
It's a completely binary decision. You either fund TEST or the NPC sink. In either case, you can still directly trade *with* TEST, it's just one decision cuts in TEST for *every* transaction and the other doesn't.
---
You have a pretty good point.... maybe all New Eden and WH pirates are ceremoniously dropped on their heads as babies.  Yes, making ratters spread out to low ADM and military indexed systems to rat/farm would be the obvious choice, then after 24 hour of ratting they'd have to go somewhere else with low ADM/index.
---
&gt; C)d-scan doesn't provide Intel on whether that ship is friendly or hostile. If a bot runs away everytime another ship shows up on scan then you're going to have to have 1 ship per system.
---
you know what dscan shows? Ship type and name, so you would have to get the name of one of their known witelisted ratting ships and then fly the same ship not at the same time as the other one is out to not arouse suspicion.
---
isn't every nullsec krab with half a brain gonna cyno bait tank their ishtar and drop on ur shiny t3cs

Need something similar for this update.
---
I love this idea. Like if a ship is cloaked for a certain random time the drifters should warp to within 1k and force an engagement. Think of it as a "hey are you still here?" Mechanic.
---
Naw. Drone regions only. You guys already have too much fun down there.
---
You can do that now. Zkill is opt-in.
---
Unless they fly my favourite ship. Flying that sort of ships can be a gift, but it can also be a curse.
---
10/10 OP
---
TAPI is literally trash lmfao, gets dumpstered by newbeans and have to cut in all of nullsec so they don't lose their TTT...
---
After doing all the fucking work lmfaaooooooooo idiots
---
Drifters can already point out past 100km and insta lock, so randomly warp  to cloaked ships to uncloak them and kill them, sure, why not.
---
Hey NPC taxes vs uncertainty. I'll keep my trillion trading in Jita k thx bai

&gt;I was only pretending to be retarded

I had this yesterday night. Popped while inside an asteroid belt and being a week old I messaged the guy all "Right, what the hell am I doing wrong, what can I do to improve?"
---
He replied with 10mil, a sorry, an invite to a corp and a mail with a wall of links to information.
---
No Risk, no reward.
---
Funny, I remember people saying this after TTT was anchored. Yet I've still managed to not buy or sell a single thing out of it since its gone up. But hey, I'm only a small percentage of Eve's overall wealth...what do I know.
---
People still think Eve devs read and consider ideas from Reddit?
---
&gt; For most of the ratters/miners be on coms
---
you'd be surprised...
---
:(((
---
The AFK ratter macroeconomically kills the game. What does the afk camper do? You won't even know it's there anymore.
---
i think they should go further and blackout the whole eve cluster. just keep local in the starter systems in hisec and make the blackouts worse as you go from hisec to losec to nullsec, also a side effect could be local in the wormhole systems for a short while, that would make things interesting

---
There's a ton of things an alt can do:
---
- PI (all three chars per account can easily make 1.3-1.5B every 20 days)
---
- bpo research and copy
---
- you can train one alt as hauler (blockade runner to JF) + reprocessing (scrap metal + ore + moon goo) + industrial production + trade
---
- you can trade the 2nd alt as miner
---
On a second account you can train:
---
- one toon for pvp (subcap, carrier/super and dread) and pve (Ishtar, carrier/super) 
---
- one toon cyno alt
---
- one toon as hisec trader and JF pilot
---
Imho you need a second account only to scale up income (ratting or mining), scouting and if you want to use capitals/supers. 
---
Having a capital/super with only one account imho is a bad idea, you have to depend on cyno beacons (which means lose your capital in many cases) or other people to light the cyno for you.
---
Wrong. There is no hamster in this picture.

From what I understand Eve will work through Wine or through the Steam client, though I've never run it on my Debian machines
---
So if groups are concerned about giving away easy/free intel, maybe just don't put api into zkillboard?

but how else are people supposed to multibox 10 vnis?
---
We were kinda expecting that change every year for the past 7
---
Why would the blackout affect locator agents? Makes no sense lorewise.
---
I really like the Scorpion, could you share your opinion on why it needs a redesign?
---
Surprisingly low paying.

The problem is that the current system isn't fun. Being realistic would be the better thing here.

Yeah, why won't anyone undock battleships for these poor caps to dunk instead?
---
Realistic? Why do pirates always set their "maze" pattern of gates the exact same way? Why do they always send reinforcements through in small, easily manageable waves? Why do so many of those reinforcement waves carry little or no tackle? Do pirates not have dictors or hictors? Faction spawn hictors would be hilarious. Why don't pirates put up cynosure jammers on their hidey holes?
---
You're half right.  I believe the mechanic is thought to be a short delay before respawning the site,  somewhere in the same constellation.   Since you cannot reliably connect to every system in a jspace constellation, each wh group functionally hits a limit where they can't trigger respawns.   However if you're bored or extra krabby, and get a connection to an unused system in your constellation where they've built up, clearing the backlog will generate the new anoms.  Depending on quantity,  there can be good odds of one being in your home.
---
Damn man, we should unionize. I'd say assholes unite but I dont want another human centipede.
---
I know thats a eve meme or something and it was funny for the 37371718828383838828283 time..but now its getting old
---
I can only wish that I had been playing the game long enough, to know enough, to truly appreciate this comment for all that it's worth. Because even though I only understand about 65% of it, it's still funny as hell.
---
Sounds like a recipe for hip dysplasia.
---
I have been using this client for the last month or so. Has been working real well.
---
I haven't had any mayor problems with the 64bit-client so far, so this should be a good change. Rolling it out on a friday seems like a risky decision, though.
---
Yea that sounds fine too, as long as there is counter play.  I also strongly agree with limiting what ships fit them as right now you literally just throw them on any old shit box.
---
I think it's only fair that if ratting requires activity then the pvp also require activity.
---
If I can't see hostiles in local, then probably they can't see me either therefor I am safe
---
I dunno why anyone would join Snuff at the moment when this is the best content they can muster.
---
^ pretty much this.  Snuff like to meme about being kings of lowsec but they're moreso just kings of target selection.  Their supers never jump into a fight that could possibly result in a loss. Living in null would also mean that they'd have to commit to a side.  By staying in lowsec they can remain neutral and work with more or less anyone naive enough to trust them.
---
Thats all off shoring was used for. High ticket items people would travel for or buy orders.
---
Without Local, AFK campers serve no purpose, so they can be removed. May as well remove them with a game mechanic.
---
Why?
---
One of the top publicly stated goals of CCP is reducing faucets. Sorry, you've been causing so much ISK/mineral pump to the game. PvP'ers haven't.
---
Is there any reason to favour 32 bit?
---
Old hardware support.
---
Well you can relatively easy justify today's mechanics.
---
‚ÄúThe blood raiders notice that they are about to lose control of a system and therefore sending more and more units there‚Äù
---
That‚Äôs why increased military index leads to more anomalies.
---
yeah possibly, but using 'realism' as one of your biggest reasonings is dumb
---
I'm using Lutris to setup my wine prefix. My Distro is Fedora, but the only difference in the setup process is installing WineHQ. There is a HowTo for all the popular Distros on the WineHQ-Website. After you installed wine-staging and lutris, launch lutris and use one of the installer. 
---
Link to the EVE-Installer: [https://lutris.net/games/eve-online/](https://lutris.net/games/eve-online/)
---
This method to setup game under wine I like the most. You can tweak the wineprefix through the lutris launcher too.
---
How long after implementing this change do you think it would take for a drifter to land on a paper thin move fitted cloaked super, resulting in fresh tears on reddit about how CCP is ruining the game...
---
No.
---
yes, it makes a difference, especially if you are in lowsec. However, if you are in WH space or nullsec then you probably dont need it since the resource concentrations are high already. 
---
I have 3 main PI pullers with AP V and 6 alt pi pullers with AP IV.  There is a noticeable difference when pulling from the same planet.
---
Just a few years ago a billion ISK was a lot of ISk. Moons were how big alliances printed their ISK.  People's weren't afk ratting in super carriers and Roquals and buying a plex didn't sell for a hell of a lot.. Like a couple hundred million..
---
Moons were the gold.. so people fought over them.. because too many Supers &amp; now Titans came into the game...
---
heh
---
&gt; Then why has it not been implemented? 
---
Because you need someone to implement and keep it updated at all times and CCP seems to hate actually spending money on employees
---
I'm sorry I meant the amount of stations not systems*
---
I would favor a gnosis or a praxis myself. Cheap, nonexistent skill requirement, lots of fitting options. I personally prefer heavy missiles if you have the skills, but you can also rail fit them.
---
&gt;For CCP the loss will be minimal, as these people anyway did put no money onto CCPs account, the money CCP received from the people buing this PLEX from them to put them to the market.
---
Look at you, thinking you know how an economy works. Adorable.
---
Without the demand, people will have less interest in buying PLEX with real money to sell it for isk. Just because those krabbers aren't spending real money doesn't mean that CCP isn't heavily profiting off them. In fact, they're making more per account considering 500 plex is $20 compared to a standard $15 sub.
---
Why would you fit a stab on your botting or afk VNI?
---
Of course you can. Been running Eve on linux since 2014 now.

Personally I'd go with the Moa and skill up some range skills on the railguns and focus the rat cruisers with your guns and use its decent dronebay to kill destroyers and frigates with drones to save some ammo.
---
If you're doing High Sec Combat Sites and Escalations the Moa or Caracal should easily be able to tank the lower end ones without much effort.
---
Is anyone still using 32 bit OS?
---
So you can still program your bot to warp out something decloaks on grid.

I think that may be a 'Synergy 2' production video switcher, circa 15 year-old tech.
---
I walk past serial #1 on-display, whenever I leave my office desk.
---
So if you bought a Plex pack, could you use one of those to add gametime to an alpha? Is that not way way cheaper than subbing an account?
---
cloaky camping is a symptom, removing local should fix it.
---
&gt; Without Local, AFK campers serve no purpose
---
If this is true, then they will log off anyway. Why do you want to solve a nonexistent problem?
---
PS: 
---
It actually isn't true. There are two kinds of afk camping. One is in regions where you do it to force people dock. The other is in regions (such as Delve or Esoteria) where people aren't afraid of neutrals in local, and you do it for intel or setting traps.
---
People who do it for the first purpose will stop. I recently began AFK camping in Delve. I will keep using it as an intel/dscan tool. Won't log them off just because of local.
---
Pretty sure nobody actually cares.
---
CCPlz....
---
Oh! Well then I have to say I'm not quite sure. Maybe more stations means the space is more attractive so there are more people/targets there? I'm not too familiar with nullsec, I spend most of my time in w space hahah
---
Apparently the official wine version sucks but people have had success hand rolling their own solutions(not as hard as it seems).
---
I'll try to find the guy in my corp who donnit and will post back here for ya, OP.
---
The trouble with the Thrasher re-design is that:
---
a) it looked nothing like the thrasher
---
b) it was incredibly generic, in good part bevause they didn't show it in proper minnie colors
---
c) the thrasher doesn't really need a re-design, just a hand of new textures on top of an already excellent model
---
In general, a lot of newer models have lost a lot of their EVE flavour and switched to a much more "mainstream" design language. Where are the windows?
---
If nobody cares then we agree no change is needed here.
---
Also remember that you have 3 character slots per account, irrelevant to alpha or omega. If money is an issue, take some of the recommendations in this thread and train them up on the same account.
---
I ran 2 accounts for years and about a year ago i onlined a 3rd and a month ago i onlined 2 more. I plan on onlining 4 more once i get isk. I am rorq mining in nul and the new accounts are in covetors training into hulks.

On the other hand, things which serve no purpose should be purged.

All ships should have Maulus Navy bonuses.

Clicking "Windows Version" shows the following 32-bit OS being used according to Steam Hardware Survey:
---
- Windows 7: 1.03%
---
- Windows 10: 0.19%
---
So roughly 1.22% of a possible multi-million Steam survey pool used 32-bit OS.
---
That number may be higher or lower for non-Steam users, like ones that use the standalone launcher.
---
What serves a purpose for you does not necessarily serve a purpose towards the greater whole. Things which do not serve a benefit towards the greater whole should be purged, should they not?
---
Well thanks for the information kind redditor!

Only 5x stabbed FW Punisher I ever lost was to a maulus navy issue, I stopped letting people I saw on d-scan scram me after that.

Been waiting for WDS propaganda.
---
It's possible. I know some people that do it. But also, people want that dank killboard to brag about.
---
Let me add a healthy dose of reality there: very many people understand poems. IQ is going to play a part in that. In the context of EVE it‚Äôs going to be a matter of understanding what the damn thing is.
---
I have only ever been able to marginally explain what EVE is to civilians, they invariably look at me as if there‚Äôs something wrong with me. Some people actually tell me that with so many words.
---
It‚Äôs an awareness of the culture. One Fanfest we walked into [this wonderful scene](https://imgur.com/ebPfU0P), which made me grin as wide as I could. I showed this picture to my civilian friends who were amazed and appalled by the idea of food with blue icing. That is one layer. The second layer, the social commentary layer, blew right past them, obviously.
---
EVE is an evolving artistic master piece that knows a myriad expressions, and of which I think it could be a true global phenomenon if CCP would be able to bring the cluster to life as a valid third space to spend time in.
---
You don‚Äôt need high IQ to appreciate the beauty of EVE. But to appreciate the subtlety of a lot of its connotations and to give them their right place in context, it needs a bit of thinking.
---
Myrmidon. Run 3 Heavies and two mediums. Less isk but lower investment and less loss when it dies. 
---
If you want to keep it or make slightly more isk, then you want an Ishtar because it's a better VNI.

---
If you want to remove something that is already in the game that serves a purpose for at least some people, you need a reason why, and that should be stronger than "nobody cares". 
---
The burden of proof is on you to show that I am causing harm to the greater whole. Or else what you want is CCP to reduce active sub/player counts for no reason at all, which is unreasonable.
---
I legitimately laughed at this, +1
---
Well based on that I can 32 bit support for maybe another year or so. Thanks bean!
---
It‚Äôs time YouTube took a stand against this kind of content.
---
Well, that's an old stock image.
---
If that's a 'Synergy 2' panel, it is about 15 years old.  If a 'Synergy', even older.
---
[This](https://2wk12w2dk3733zyjdf3secd9-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/A2x-Panel.jpg) is what production video switcher panels look like now.
---
oh you got me there......
---
last time they did some reimbursement thing for people who had the removed mods in their inventory, not sure what happened to ones still anchored.
---
But we only got 6 months of W7 support left before it gets pitched in the bin like XP, ME and Bob... 
---
Plus Microsoft can have my W7 keys when they pry them from my cold dead fingers.
---
You'll still be Wingspan right?
---
Hs will still have local
---
Seems FRAT and allies are giving up on Detorid, some pets already moving out.
---
afk pvpers like yourself are very detrimental to the game and only promotes the stagnation that this game suffers from b/c skill point farming - your passive income should be offset 
---
Of course you would only support changes that benefit you specifically and are against anything that might force you to be at your keyboard
---
But the poor newbros and their 20 vnis "friends"
---
As a general rule a 64bit client will utilize a higher amount of memory compared to a 32bit client. On systems will a limited amount of memory or in cases where someone may want to run a large number of clients the 32bit client may be preferred.
---
Don't make promises you can't keep if you don't want to be called out for being a liar.  This is totally justified, as he said it would never go above .3.  Giving up control so that you can't control it is equally as bad as raising the taxes yourself.
---
Iunno if this thread will hit u up but I've been reading it as I'm in the same situation as op I'll be working out of wh space was wondering if u got a fit for wh curse even tho one month later cheers!
---
&gt; afk pvpers
---
There is no afk pvp.
---
I think it'd be nice if they made available limited-run "original hull design" BPCs for ships that have gotten redesigned, maybe as part of events or something. You'd use the BP and get the same ship, just with the old hull design before its respective redesign. I just think that would be kinda neat. A unique collector's item.
---
So you are confirming Vily is liar and nothing Test/Vily says is trustworthy, got it.
---
It wouldn't be good for their public image if they banned the mentally ill from uploading, though.
---
They're seeking balance when making the changes.
---
Yeah, April-2010 it first broke 300m. The rise has been totally predictable for years though, you can whip up an exponential relationship to time and it predicts it perfectly. In other words: CCP wanted this.
---
bro you're an afk pvper, just as people afk VNI rat and afk rorqual mine - you afk pvp
---
How about removing closet camping because it‚Äôs stupid that you have no fuel or time restriction and are completely invulnerable to being scanned down. You don‚Äôt scare competent pilots And only snag the hyper special fit restrds
---
I'm not sure why you put the word realism in quote marks as i didn't even use that word even once. I used the word "logic" which is different from realism.
---
Vily/Test gave up controlling interest not allowing them to keep their promise, just as bad.  Still untrustworthy and a pathetic narrative, just man up and say TEST/Vily's word is worth nothing.
---
Doesnt matter if it pays itself off in a few days.
---
Just joined back up last night :)
---
afk pvping serves no purpose except skill goo farming
---
Oh, thanks
---
you spoke about realism without saying the word
---
&gt;*With all your Rorquals and industry alts, you'd be the first one to cry if skill farming was removed today.*
---
What? Why would I?
---
&gt;*Except your interests actually my style of play ~~harm the game~~, mine don't affect my style of play, which is why CCP is ~~nerfing yours and not mine~~ doing dumb shit. ~~Deal with it~~ I'm an afk pvper, such elite.*
---
Memeing isn‚Äôt my intention.
---
The only ships capable of safely ratting at this time are capitals. They have the tank needed to withstand Drifters and can deploy to save other vessels from Drifter attacks, subcapitals are irrelevant and cannot survive the large number of Drifters currently spawning in Nullsec. The presence of Drifter vessels in Nullsec suggests that subcapital vessels are less desired in Nullsec, not the other way around.
---
AFK cloaked vessels contribute nothing to a Nullsec which has no Local chat, they cannot be seen and they cannot see anything. A cloaked vessel which is actively probing is, by definition, not AFK. However, as they are subcapital vessels, they are less desirable in Nullsec by the above postulate.
---
In this line of reasoning, CCP has multiple reasons they could use to remove AFK cloaked campers.
---
I've watched it so, so many times!
---
I actually remember everything described, either experienced or know what is being referred to.
---
Drones are still working as well as ever, too.
---

---
Gila, or you can go to the T2 version (Ishtar)
---
Eos (great for afk), Dominix (good for afk), Ishtar (great for afk), Myrmidon (ok for afk), Stratios (ok for afk), Gila (good for afk), Bhallgorn (great for non-afk), 2 tinker Vexors (good for afk), Rattlesnake (exceptional for non-afk)
---
I am baffled at this afk pvp concept. Please tell me more. How many killmails per hour I can make if I remain 45 campers logged on in Delve? 
---
Every comment you are making is dumber than the previous :). It's your credibility you are destroying in your attempts to trigger me, so tell us more mate.
---
One day maybe, i hope so ! It'd be a lot of work for CCP but i do believe they're ambitious enough to end up doing stuff like that. We'll see !
---
That's a decent self-portrait there, Cuckleangelo.
---
I know one that quit, sold their account, move to Australia and hasn't been back for nearly ten years now.
---
Another quit five years ago and has zero interest, not even tooling around in an Alpha clone for laughs or to see what has changed.
---
Finally, there is one that quit six years ago and has since died.
---
At the very least, the last one isn't taking a break.
---
pvper would imply that target actually fights back. Olmeca only ganks.
---
I like Linux, but windows cost me like 15 usd and if you are primarily gaming you‚Äôre dense if you think Linux is superior.
---
Trivia:  the servers are in a separate room, because otherwise the control room would be too noisy.
---
'No hamsters were harmed in the making of this product.'
---
'Some assembly required.  Hamsters not included.'
---
Approved.
---
&gt; You don‚Äôt scare competent pilots And only snag the hyper special fit restrds
---
Mate if you have a problem with my playstyle be honest, not hide behind fake balance concerns lol.
---
yes im on china killing spree
---
have you learned goddamn nothing
---
friday just before you fuck off is the best time to release - surely nothing would go wrong and you can have a nice peaceful weekend to think about how great you are
---
I just want drones to be manually controlled, like fighters.
---
It would probably mean a healthier EVE in 5 years time.
---
IDK about eve but in world of warcraft the 32bit client was a lot easier to hook for botting and other hacking. If that's also true for eve it'll be the reason the 32bit client stays prolific until its complete shuttering.
---
pls
---
The 400ish afk camping accounts existing in this game probably contributing to skill pump at a scale of 1/100000s compared to the effect of your thousands of your AFK Rorqual miners, capital alts.
---
If you have an issue with skill farming, let's advocate for removing it. You'll be the first one to cry.
---
And if that's easy why aren't you making that dank isk in a short period of time?
---
It's at least a 15 year-old panel, so you may not be far off.
---
&gt; What? Why would I?
---
All right. Then you can make a thread and complain about skill farms.
---
"It's dead, Jim!"
---
That's obviously not an EVE player tho. I mean, only one monitor.
---
Awesome info, cheers !
---
eww
---
Our LP store is garbage, those doors are the best thing in there.
---
All the better for camping
---
&gt; AFK cloaked vessels contribute nothin
---
Again, this doesn't tell afk campers how they are harming the game.
---
I provide content to hundreds of people in my NPSI that wouldn't have been possible without afk camping. Who are you to decide an activity doesn't contribute to anything?
---
WTB Orcling scavenger hunt: person who finds the most orclings in local and documents with screenshots in a one hour timeframe wins.
---
This is the 8th thread with this exact question.... I‚Äôm amazed that people are still being helpful and not trying to boil the dirty krabs.
---
I'm not sure I agree.
---
It makes sense with a carrier, since you have nothing else to do.
---
Yes.
---
Yes, sorry.
---
Where are the other threads I honestly haven‚Äôt seen them. All I see is ‚Äúreeeeee my VNI is dead unsubbing‚Äù or ‚Äúwooooo fuck off krabbers die in a fire‚Äù 
---
Never any actual unbiased advice.
---
Agreed.  What might make more sense is if there was something like a fixed pirate population across a region.  
---
If all military indexes were equally low, the pirate population would be distributed purely based on the system security value.  
---
But as military indexes are raised throughout the region, pirates start to trickle more heavily toward those lowest value systems.
---
That which contributes nothing consumes more resources than it contributes. An AFK camper contributes nothing. A probing cloaked camper is not AFK. In what context can a camper be both AFK and not AFK at the same time?
---
Again, logic and realism are two different things, it's close but not quite. But you said it yourself, i didnt say the word, so don't put it in quote marks that's all
---
IMO if your goal is to afk Domi is the closest thing to VNI, other than an Ishtar. (Ishtar would be the best, but high skill requirement) Myrm has less damage, anything else will rely on guns or missile for a portion of DPS, Domi can do pretty much what the 125 bandwidth VNI does without much more skill requirement. It will end up being a tad more expensive than a VNI, though, but it can fit a Cyno so you can try to get rescued.
---
I've been experimenting with Domi fits ratting in Blood Raider space and it's been a bit of a challenge to get something that can truly AFK with Neuts while tanking enough, and I've had success with the following:
---
    Centum C-Type Energized Thermal Membrane
---
If you don't have to deal with Neuting rats it becomes a lot easier. Slap a Drove Navigation computer or two in the mids, and you can use active hardeners for a sturdier tank. The faction EANMs are super cheap. The whole fit+ship runs about 300m.
---
Make it so capitals can only jump to cynos originating from other capitals
---
High ADM and better site spawns was one of the main bonuses of using your systems.
---
A system which actively discourages you to do things in space, is a really bad design.
---
With new ECM mechanics, it doesn't matter anymore, since you can still lock the ship jamming you now. For damps, its a solid point. There are also other situations where the auto aggro is useful, such as if you jump through a gate with a camp there and you're in a battleship or something slow-ish. You can drop EC drones before anyone locks you and they will aggress the first thing that aggro's you (useful to get an RNG jam off on their tackle to warp out or MJD).
---
Test can still drop 500 nerds on it, goons can drop another 1000 on it. All in jamming ships, in max tidi. Reshipping every few minutes.   Also, with sensor damps.  Not a fight I‚Äôd want to be in.   Don‚Äôt forget, goons can blob with supers and sub caps.  And in hisec we don‚Äôt have to worry about boat bombing our fleet.
---
My OS doesn't spy on me. That makes it superior.
---
It's a question of how much they want to make null like wormholes for this event. I don't think they need to turn off all the statistical endpoints on an hourly basis, for example, or the ability to see who owns the system.
---
I do think it would make sense to take away the live or near-live stats - pilots in space, cynos lit, stuff like that.
---
&gt;  An AFK camper contributes nothing. 
---
If this is true, there'd be no afk campers. It won't become true when you keep saying it :)
---
We talked about this at eve north like about 5 hrs non stop
---
While i'd agree with a mid-level military index, when it's maxed out, the pirates should realize they did lose control of this system and move the battle somewhere else.
---
Think all of that footage was captured in 2018?
---
&gt; okay for the sake of argument, im wrong about whats given via api.
---
Wasn't "whats given via api" your entire argument in this thread?
---
Nullsec without Local does not exist yet.
---
Discord bot can only read the API, not in game
---
More or less.
---
A Rorq pilot at the keyboard is unlikely, as I've not been out in a year, as I think I was the only one in Eve ATK.
---
I remember once when a corp member fell asleep, lost all his excavators to NPC.  Luckily he was in standing fleet, so had him moved so we could fleet-warp him to safety.
---
It was the second time he had done that.  He was mining to earn-back the ISK he borrowed to replace everything after the last time.  He quit shortly thereafter.
---
free intel for hunters creates laziness, as has been proven.  Take the timerboard example, worst thing ever.  If you want to see timers you just go to the website forget actually scouting, you dont have to.  Free intel is free intel and imo always bad.
---
calm down there noam chomsky, its not an argument or debate, just an opinion on a subjective thing.
---
This is art
---
So if null local changes go into the game permanently, people can leave afk camping if it contributes to nothing. If not, then it contributes to something.
---
they are clones, they were all born with the same ideas, placed in the same ships, and given the same missions.
---
That's actually a reasonably good suggestion, though I don't think it would be enough (it would make a HIC mandatory for any roaming gang).
---
You can't dscan them. You can scan them down with combat probes though.
---
Idk why farmers can be lazy afk Rorqual farm under utmost security but expect hunters to spend hours to get info to even decide which region to hunt in.
---
Send your stuff to me for safekeeping.
---
Main color is correct, but the trim needs to shiny gold.
---
You can check your account activity at the account management page.
---
3-6b a month for 2mins work per week... was  a lot nicer than now
---
Thanks I will definitely give this a try tonight! Sounds better then an Ishtar cus I have at least a small chance of killing someone thinking I‚Äôm afk ;)
---
Did you shit tier trolls lost all comebacks besides this one?
---
Have you tried multiboxing? Heard massive ram issues.
---
Will add to that list corps, TEST's Brand Newbros.
---
Of course, Dreddit is recruiting, too.
---
At no point did I suggest that it was my place to decide such things.
---
That is for CCP to decide.
---
But there is nothing saying that speculation cannot be made on the sidelines.
---
Wow I want that system mining is gay as fuck
---
This. The 64 bit client requires a ton of memory. Even those with a good harddrive and large virtual cache will run into issues if they run more than 2-3 clients. 
---
I run 8 on the 32 and it gets sluggish at times. I can't do my subcap mining fleet on the 64 without a signifigant upgrade in ram.
---
The purpose isn't to use pathfinder, it's to use automated api information to track your blues so you know who isn't. I'm not sure why you're so against removing ambiguity in your approach.
---
Would upvote you. But downvoted for using the word pubbie -.-
---
Its up to players to decide whether a playstyle is useful to them.
---
If it is, CCP will ofc keep it in the game.
---
&gt; A system which actively discourages you to do things in space, is a really bad design. 
---
Which is the exact issue i have with the current system. It encourages you to do things in one system, and should encourage people to do more things in more systems, not just your staging.
---
Lol I literally made an entire video about this idiotic point.
---
My ganks take more talent than your standard F1 monkeying. We already established that.
---
We did however get a great video from Olmeca, showing us in a time where we have reached content stagnance that he was willing to think outside the box and when arguably half of null wrote him off as a loony and ran smear campaigns against him. He was still able to push forward with radical styles of gameplay. I'm very optimistic having him on the csm as well as CCPs willingness to shake things up. I think good things are to come for us.
---
&gt; tdlr: eve more better for newbies, try something else, because your current plan isn't growing the user base in comparison to other mmos. 
---
Compared to what other MMOs?  Source your assertion please.
---
Excuses just because TEST is not able to do anything without blueing half the universe
---
Someone said it before. Caps should beat structures. Structures beat subcaps. Subcaps beat caps.
---
??? altight then i see the word logic is foreign to you as a whole
---
It also makes cap behavior predictable in a way that can be exploited.
---
Return to sender, address not found
---
Good idea, but a more effective penalty should be reducing drone control range.
---
I just remembered that [two years ago people thought this was a bad idea.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/6gaozl/possible_afktarafkvni_fix/?st=jxuu7xb6&amp;sh=0b16b98b)
---
But CCP is clearly trying to discourage the use of subcapital vessels, this indicates an intervention in playstyle.
---
&gt;tl;dr: Drifters bad, playerbase good, work together and this could be a lot of fun 
---
We'd rather kill eachother
---
It seems to me that there are a couple of main drivers of conflict: need for more space and need to move. That's aside from the ever-present "need for content." With this in mind I think making krabbing a more spread out activity would help and further making it require moving between systems.
---
So perhaps a functionality wherein excessive ratting of a system causes it to reset thus lower it's anom amount causing you to need to spread out between systems, thus requiring more space. Some other people have suggested that we flip it so the more you rat the less anoms spawn and vice versa thus causing the krabs to spread. Something along those lines. Perhaps have it for mining as well. 
---
But I might take it a step further and suggest that PvE in Eve become less passive on the large scale; at the moment a player is nearly indistinguishable from a bot when it comes to making money. I would suggest make PvE more interactive, like Abyssal sites do now, and further make it so the first level Abyssal you do is very weak and low pay requiring you to go to an escalation for the real big payout, this might be in system or elsewhere. I've seen a lot of fights occur from current anom escalations, so what if nearly all anoms required traveling to make real isk? 
---
Maybe I'm off the mark, but I think that forcing line members of big and small null blocks to move around and actually do some minimal thinking about PvE might drive more conflict.
---
fair
---
pvp
---
FWI (not saying this applies here, just additional info),
---
There are also a lot of holding corps that are just for wardec'ing.
---
When the war starts, a bunch of alts will join, destroy valuable targets, and leave to yet another wardec corp.
---
Repeat ad infinitum.
---
The '1 member' holding-corp prevents one from getting advanced intel before the war starts.
---
It would only make sense for the first week or two, maybe a month. After a ywsr of getting eviscerated, I can't imagine they'd persist.
---
krabs are gonna be krabs
---
if krab indexes is rise they must also drops by entosis link on ihub mb?
---
Great post with thoughtful points made, too bad shitters are downvoting this thread.
---
If these changes are made permanent (and this ofc is a big if), renter alliances and small independent-ish alliances will die out completely, krabs will further conglomerate into one of the few mega-coalitions, myrmidons will replace VNIs, and more people will inject into carriers since it will be the only safe way to rat.
---
But even if the blackout becomes a giant failure and it gets reverted, that is ok. Any change is a good thing because it makes the game fresh.
---
&gt; If that were true, you could just cloaky camp in any system and no bots would ever undock, idiot. It's not local that's defeating you.
---
That's exactly how it works -- for about 3-5 days, depending on how stubborn/greedy the bot manager is. But eventually they get tired of not making money and decide it's better to feed the occasional VNI and make some profit rather than stay safe and make none, so they whitelist the camper.
---
That's the same calculations that every krab will make under the no local meta. At first they'll stay turtled up, resisting the changes however they can. But eventually they'll accept the added risk as a cost of doing business and get back out there. And yes, we will hunt them. We will cull the stupid and the lazy. But we don't stop krabbing or make it unprofitable for long. The meta will adapt.
---
When WINGSPAN originated, I thought maybe we'd have a fairly active nullsec wing. I guess better late than never?
---
How about you make a 2019 Summer comeback and show them how proper PVP is supposed to be done with a zkill guide. (or two, or more)
---
They were pretty awesome.
---
The more surprising thing here is that windows 10 *has* a 32-bit version.
---
Ok, but only if you then increase the WH spanw rate by 2000%
---
&gt; Where as now you can make like 10-20b per moon and there's plenty for everyone
---
A corp mate usually had about 8 lowsec moons.  An alliance moon-mogul could easily do a hundred moons or more.
---
The most tedious part was refuelling.  After that, it was just a matter of regularly emptying the silos.
---
what are you even talking about
---
is this european power hour or something sheesh
---
ha, good point. do you think a more short form playlist would be easier to consume? More themed and maybe an hour long? You're right, 5 hours is pretty fucking long and I built it to be listened to fully through. This is an interesting challenge. I want to make Triglavian, Drifter, WH, 'k space relaxing' playlists....what do you think?
---
Its all fun and games until Hilmar sells CCP to Kore.....nvm
---
then why don't you do it
---
" that almost anything to make goons and us, hordelings, undock and fight is good. " But will that actually happen? Sure hunters might undock more, but the people they used to hunt will most likely undock less, its hard to know what will happen to the overall number of targets in space until this goes live. But I don't see this massive PVP bonanza happening that everyone seems to think this will trigger.
---
If that was the case there would be a lot more wars and a lot more small battles and skirmishes. This doesnt happen enough and the only ones to blame are us the players.
---
you insult the crab god
---
The early bird catches the worm
---
Yup still remains an ongoing disruption to the prosecution of the war in detorid
---
We tried. Our target didn't want to play
---
You claim to be a Goon. You even wrote that.
---
I came back 6 months ago. Drifters are great, it's the playerbase who is killing the game. So many dicks flying around in space.
---
Since this is what OP asked for.
---
As a preferred target
---
No the guy who made the video just sharing
---
and how many of them were not ratters.....
---
Its easy to roll thera holes and drop on people :)
---
Theory:  if you remove the engines from a plane, it will be lighter and fly faster.
---
\^ this is exactly what I'm saying.
---
Eh, if you want to hold more than one system you do have to do more ratting in other systems to get those ADM's up too. I like the sentiment, but I don't want low activity systems to be even harder to take
---
They are what we hunt so well... Without them hunter are nothing
---
I dont agree with afk farmers either, but they are static, and if you are out hunting you find them.  If you want to make things easier for hunters but harder for farmers who are static then you need to widen your perspectives and think of other playstyles other than your own.  
---
Drifters are a whole different animal there is no counterplay to them, no discouraging as they are computer generated and are limitless.
---
Should i put it in another spot? Just following the tips of the video anyway i guess he knows what he he is doing he didnt trigger it or do anything to do a silly mistake
---
Awesome vid, thanks for sharing it..
---
A few other people asked the same thing about what to replace a VNI with explicitly. If you search for VNI you should be able to find them.

I run 5 accounts no problem with 32gb ram on an i7-6700k.
---
32 GB ram.. yeah, most people aren't running that much still.
---
We have been pushing the B274 memes pretty hard over the last 6-12 months. There are still those that know the way of null, it's just that the landscape is so volatile.... Our Intel is a tad out of date ;)
---
But never fret. WiNGSPAN Delivery Agents are top notch in all of New Eden. K space, J space, you name it.
---
I gotta nudge you into using that nice beautiful ship I heard you have on the shelf gathering dust, boss.
---
Is the main goal of it that it lasts better for higher end combat because of the ability to run more memory?

    [ME] Hey, you're up in my bounty list for 2bil ISK. You can have 200mil from it if you play ball. Proof @ imgur.com/whatever
---
    [Target] What do you mean, "play ball"?
---
    [Me] Simple: we agree a time+place, you undock in a cheap / unfit T1 hulll, I kill you and get bounty. Afterwards I send you some of the ISK. I won't screw you - but even if I was to, at worst you loose a T1 hull worth a few hundred thousand ISK. As I said though, if you make it easy you'll get 10%. (i.e. 200mil). Check my corp - we have reputation for doing this fairly.
---
    [Target] Make it 500mil and ok.
---
    [Me] Nope. We only do 10% refund-to-target for arranged kills. Corp rules.
---
    [Target] Whatever. I'll take 200m then.
---
    [Me] Cool. Your sec-status looks good, so Hi-Sec should be fine? Jita - Planet III or Amarr Planet V between 17:00 and 19:00 EVE.
---
    [Target] Doing an op tonight, but can do either location and time tomorrow.
---
    [Me] Jita Planet III tomorrow at 17:15 EVE. Convo me or EVEmail if you need new timeslot.

Stuff... can I haz

so why'd you stop
---
What? Please retype that. I dont understand it.
---
They ran out of structures to poke
---
The third step for reinstalling is optional btw
---
Yes quite a lot actually
---
Why are you asking on Reddit lmbo
---
Reformat all your hard drives should do the trick
---
It's definitely stored locally if you have it set to log all chat channels.
---
As per what CCP stores, well that's up to them. I'm pretty sure the EULA will have more information.
---
OK but most people don't want to feed, regardless of whether they want to make money or not.
---
You can delete all except the 'settings' and 'settings_Default' Folder which contains your Settings. the Rest are logs, dumps and cached Files.
---
Thanks for the response. Got a question.  
---
I've set up P0-&gt;P2 on one planet but I have a problem with the routes from extractor to a factory. I have to set the same route multiple times. What am I doing wrong? https://imgur.com/a/QIB3SYe
---
so absolutely nobody, gottcha
---
Goons actually have 1,000 Titan votes...  not unlike how they stack the CSM
---
I remember when losing frigates was painful.
---
I posted a separate thread about it. ‚Äò‚ÄòTis true
---
&gt;We'd rather shoot rocks.
---
FTFY
---
Ill need to login for that. Saved my subs for blackout.
---
&gt; and if you are out hunting you find them
---
They generate value. AFK campers don't.
---
What does that change?
---
I'm considering joining but haven't been able to see this information anywhere and thought someone here would probably know the answer.
---
I'm presuming by default that it probably is but would prefer to know definitively if possible
---
But then mittens went off the fucking deep end screaming fuck high sec and put a gun to people‚Äôs head and said ‚Äúraise it‚Äù
---
You‚Äôd have to be fucking retarded to not see that b
---
The short answer: They actually have balls and want their system back ;)
---
Is he though?
---
Pray I don‚Äôt alter the deal even further
---
Cloaky camping only works if the residents know that a camper is there.
---
Can confirm! Run my 14accounts with an i5-2500k an 16gb RAM. With the 32bit client it is working fine, with 64bit clients max 9 of them run stabile...
---
&gt; But CCP is clearly trying to discourage the use of subcapital vessels
---
Not that I heard of. 
---
But discouraging subcaps is a side effect of no local in null. Which is why I am against it.
---
yes, been there since i can remember (started Feb 2017)- i keep being an optimist and hoping  :)
---
You want me to take my Marshall gate to gate?
---
So I've not played online games for a while. Do people tend to use audio via the eve online system or do people talk via discord or is it predominantly text communications?
---
I've not been gaming for a few years and the trend seems to be to use audio
---
As previously noted, Capitals are the only vessels capable of coping with Drifters.
---
Less volume traded equels less volume generated
---
u/ccpfalcon we have a lad here asking something interesting.
---
4 accounts on 32gb with nary an issue. Of course, potato mode because my graphics card is 6 years old....c'mon Prime Day! Daddy needs a 2070 rtx!!
---
Market alt is handy if you live far from trade hubs, you'll know it when you need it. Don't min/max too hard when starting, enjoy the game.
---
Which means more dead caps. Which is awesome.
---
Every time a bad troll like you is cornered, they resort to the same lame attempts at insults. No creativity, no innovation. Only "lol whiteknight" as if that was a smart comeback.
---
yeah wish they would fix that for account swapping.
---
Man I though this was real. Damn you epic. +1
---
They‚Äôre using solid state hamsters.
---
His name was Grogoth Drem.
---
We needed this post
---
Stuff?
---
Found the video engineer!
---
Teamspeak/Mumble are the big ones.  Mainly for their ability to be worked into auth systems to sort roles/permissions.
---
I'm sure smaller groups use Discord just fine as well.  Though, I don't think it would support a large number at once.
---
I don't think Eve voice has ever been really utilized tbh.  Not sure how long it's been around (maybe 2010), but I might have used it once back in the early days.  Never again since then.
---
I have a great B274 you should camp with it...lots of traffic, friendly faces. 
---
Can we just give it a little hug?
---
Eve has audio?
---
Joking aside wasn't the in game voice chat removed some time ago?
---
Gila, pricey?
---
It means you take no risks and are just as bad as the krabs.
---
Honestly not a bad summary.
---
There are a few good posts on that subject. Might try using the search feature
---
I'd be surprised if many people used ingame VOIP, the majority of us would use private VOIP clients such as teamspeak, mumble or discord.
---
Brev pls no, k brev? Plez just no.
---
How about making gates so that you have to scan them down before you can warp to them like the activation gates in sites?
---
Interesting.
---
Back in the day with huge fleet fights, if nodes crashed the server would move all the ships (no pods) to the center of the sun. We combat probed a bunch of capital ships and docked them up :)
---
this is precisely what i do because steamplay has proton.
---
i was using the normal linux launcher for the longest time.
---
What's available through the API isn't really subjective, but ok
---
&gt; It means you take no risks 
---
You can't infer that merely from the fact that my targets tend to be non-smart. The region can be hard to operate.
---
[laughs in 32gig RAM]
---
I've seen people propose a spool-up time, where the longer you spool up, the more mass you can send trough. Bridging a small fleet? 2 or 3 minutes is enough spool up. Titans? full 20 minutes of you defending the cyno.
---
But CCP doesn't have a goal of discouraging subcaps. And that has nothing to do with afk camping to begin with.
---
whatever you buy i hope you buy them by the JF load.
---
Thanks for editing your original comment. I can understand it now. That dude is thirsty. He made a deal about the author being female. He then decided to protect her virtue. That is the definition white knighting. This isnt me trolling anyone, this is me giving an opinion and dealing with the shitlords that dislike it.
---
There's still local in highsec
---
Hey there fellow lutris user! I have a bug where my framerate just halves after some time until I reload the window, have you encountered anything like this?
---
Just like you. You are one of us :)
---
Maybe don't bot?
---
And you expect vily sitting between them to be able to maintain like any sense of cohesion here?  
---
It‚Äôs hysterical to me that among these three, vily is the sanest one yet he‚Äôs the one taking all the shit.  
---
If this doesn‚Äôt highlight how fucking retarded this community is nothing will.
---
Oh, nuts, posted my response before reading the thread. You appear to have won that joke race.
---
Pretty much.
---
Supposedly, one of the reasons people crash during large fights is their client runs out of memory.
---
next time you have a headache, just shoot yourself. it should do the trick.
---
Or tie the mass limmit to spool up time. If you want to jump huge fleets, you need to defend the cyno for a long time.
---
myrmridon
---
This is clearly fake. Falcon has been on vacation the whole time. 10/10, would giggle again.
---
AFK ratting is also a problem so that's fine
---
Is third party voip clients such as discord the defacto comm mechanism in all multiplayer games such as WoW? Last time I was regularly playing it was predominantly text only but I know this has evolved. Teamspeak seemed to be used predominantly but isn't so popular as it once was.
---
There are fair amount of 16 bit software still out there running which has alot of difficulty on 64 bit Windows.
---
I've also been told Microsoft internally has easily compiled 32 bit versions of Windows Server, it's support reasons they dropped 32 bit Windows Server.
---
The amount of resub posts and the fact that 95% of "reee unsubbing" are imperium bots says otherwise.
---
Make eve fun again.
---
That's also a decent balance idea. Warp stabs screw with your ability to engage with most weapon systems, that would do it for drones but in a different way.
---
Well shooting up heroin would make anyone feel good, can you be more specific?
---
looks, like i already moved my shared cache folder and this shit on my system drive is some old junk. the new one is a bit bigeer - almost 13 GB.
---
no but the subjective part is if it's too much information or not. its my personal opinion that there shouldnt be any intel available externally and you should use the in-game client and actually read the map.
---
Yet they have released NPCs into nullsec which expressly blap subcaps off the field and can only be removed by capitals.
---
BB your posting has turned into total shit recently, strangely after the null local blackout announcement. Even more than normal.
---
You forget, the retards want null to be dangerous.  Of course, only for PVE, PVPers should get free content fed to them 24/7.
---
Yes it is mainly Discord followed by mumble and TS.
---
whats the ticks on those ships
---
If you don't want to run the risk of that information being stored, do not talk about it. The vast majority of us are carrying personal tracking devices which we already know are sending audio back to the Googles/Apples/Amazons/Huaweis etc of the world. Are you concerned if people you meet every day in your workplace are recording conversations as well?
---
If you're worried about ingame communications being stored, check the game's EULA.
---
If you're worried about third party communications tools such as discord storing text and voice communications, check their EULA.
---
If you're worried about other players recording conversations, well I'm not sure what you can do about that.
---
&gt; er and this shit on my sys
---
robert
---
Forgot your tinfoil hat
---
No that's a linux user
---
no, never had that issue :/
---
alright, I'll hit the forum then \^\^
---
windows 10, took over and is better than 7 in every fucking way. 
---
Also people talking shit on MS not supporting old OS when linux users can't even decide on what distro to use.
---
Hell naw. My laptop mines Monero and I'll be damned if I use Windows for crypto
---
So you admit you do nothing but gank and not pvp then.
---
Then CCP has to make sure the engine can still correctly render the old models. 
---
That's some heavy engineering work there, for something that's only going to be flown by a few people, on rare occasion.
---
Yes. Many people. Works fine in Steam via Proton, using Wine, playonlinux, or the Eve unofficial launcher.
---
bottom tier FCs hang out too ok.  Warframe is pretty fun, nerd.
---
It is real. He had to make a new character, the beautiful Australian is returned
---
Much appreciated
---
everyone's a top tier FC mate.
---
Players will always min-max their risk and gains. It's easy to predict and it's the game designer's job to ensure the game still has a balanced economy, reasonable levels of risk and appropriate PVP opportunities knowing that to be the case.
---
This tbh
---
&gt;Are you concerned if people you meet every day in your workplace are recording conversations as well?
---
Conversations that are recorded without knowledge or consent are usually a bug or some type of clandestine device. In the normal world I believe  most people would consider it unacceptable  to have their conversations recorded unbeknown to them.
---
Personally I would tell you to try out incursions 
---
You can do them as a alpha and make a lot of isk but you do need to move alot. But I would join warp to me incursions in game chat channel there lot of people there who will help you get into it and they are very friendly. And then from there if you want to get alts it's the best way to get the isk to start of funding the training with out going into a capital and the wtm (warp to me) is located in high sec so it safe for new bros too. If you Wana know more I'm happy to help you
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Directional_scanning
---
Also a web app that can parse various in-game data (such as lists copied from local) https://dscan.info/
---
I stand my my words. I didn't even get backlash, just people who misunderstood me. Everyone needs high sec, I don't understand why you think people don't.
---
I'm not sure why TS is no longer popular but all I ever hear about is Discord
---
And I am here enjoying my DDR3 16GB that I upgraded to earlier this year haha
---
Eve has never been better for new players, alpha account, tutorials, alpha injectors, starter packs, new friendly null alliances. Back in my day we had none of these- and no skill queue.
---
Try the market, okay ace? Do you even Eve?
---
My video is called The Whaler. 95% of the time I do ganks. 
---
You can exclude that from "PvP" and I don't have to convince you that your definition of PvP is dumb.
---
Yeah, so they did things that they didn't intend to.
---
Welcome to how CCP operates.
---
I'll take that to heart haha
---
Yeah the replacement are fort fights. Just an extra timer. That‚Äôs what citadels brought us. The will to fight is still around.
---
There is nothing good about drifters. If anything, they are a detriment to the little content that actual players get as it is and add absolutely nothing positive to the game.
---
Eos, Dominix, Gila, Ishtar = Same as VNI
---
Myrmidon, Stratios, Tinker Vexors = Slightly less than VNI
---
Rattlesnake = Slightly better than VNI
---
Dscan (directional scanner) is a tool that every ship has in game. It's a very useful tool that every capsuleer has to know how to use. Check this page to learn more (also go search on YouTube for guides on how to use it effectively) 
---
i think that you'd rather need some good old metal projectile.
---
Again, that's my point - they're a fucking nuisance, so fight them out of the systems.  [https://www.pcgamer.com/eve-players-are-plotting-revenge-after-alien-invasion-mostly-just-annoyed-everyone/](https://www.pcgamer.com/eve-players-are-plotting-revenge-after-alien-invasion-mostly-just-annoyed-everyone/)  is a great article about what to do when shit like this happens.
---
Getting stuck in geometry is almost always fully reimbursed.
---
just make sure to fly a monitor always, so everyone knows you're the FC
---
Or introduce diamond rats like the drifters that will actively try and destroy structures and harass people outside of anoms.
---
So if you want those anoms spawning you also have to deal with being harassed while mining or while doing PI etc.
---
Pfft. No one does that.
---

Your video was pretty fun. I got to watch olmeca ride of the coat tails of star desu and vert and be nothing but a F1 pusher.
---
Don't route from extractor to factory, route from extractor to storage and storage to factory.
---
P0-&gt;P2 is for casuals IMO. Lots better money in P0-&gt;P1 followed by P1-&gt;P3/4. Though after you get a few billion, better yet to just buy the P1 and have only factory planets, which you can then run 24/7 without much effort.
---
Surely you can post said stats then instead of talking out your tiny little ass?
---
Nyx, also don't forget triple hyperspacal rigs
---
Its cheap/free (unless you wsnt the perks of Discord Nitro), very nice UI, and easy to use.
---
You just used the word yourself, what moral conundrum you must have put yourself in I can't imagine.  
---
I hope one day you will be able get over yourself.

It's CCP's fault that a Chocolate Bar no longer makes my week.

Rofl loot fairy
---
Why don't people use blockade runners? I don't get it.
---
The issue with TS is that you are only allowed to have a certain amount of concurrent users before you need to start paying for a license. Mumble on the other hand is a free open source VOIP client which allows as many users as your server can handle.
---
Google search ‚ÄúReddit VNI replacement‚Äù   Filter our posts before March.
---
You've bullied me out of EvE into ESO with your white, british, toxic masculinity.
---
Thank you so much for this. I thought SomaFM had disappeared years ago! I used to listen to Groove Salad and Drone Zone all the time when I was studying for school.
---
And you can still download each station as an MP3 playlist, so I'm now listening to Groove Salad through WinAmp! The nostalgia is strong today! :)
---
I'm on the "collect botter tears" side of the fence tbh
---
Yes, welcome to a bunch of design decisions are made because this is a video game.
---
Lets assume that people farm Rock Havens (because they do). A Rock Haven has at most 54 rats per site. Lets look on over at the old [dotlan for NPC kills in the last 24 hours in Delve](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Delve#npc24)
---
By my count *at least* 144 rock havens have been run in [4O-239](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/4O-239) in the last 24 hours.
---
Sure there are some systems where no one is ratting, but at the same time every system highlighted in green is by my measure actually being utilized. By my quick count 50 systems are being ratted in at a "utilized" level and by quick estimation Delve has 97.5 systems (15 constellations and assuming 6.5 systems per constellation).
---
Half of the space of Delve is being used for ratting and that's even before taking into account how truesec influences haven and sanctum spawn rates.
---
When you consider [the truesec of Delve](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Delve#sec) it becomes quite clear why the remaining 47.5 systems are not being ratted in. It's because the truesec sucks.
---
If you want people to spread out lower the truesec of sov null. Surprise surprise, people **DON'T** want to rat in the same system as everyone else. They're forced to.
---
Nice drop.
---
wouldn't have mattered, he died on the station.
---
spaceships don't have to be aerodynamic 
---
...
---
A bell curve would make more sense, with minimal capsules activity and maximum capsules farming activities leading to the lowest number of pirates... with 3ish being where they're not being massacred at a stupid rate and still believe they can hang on if they send enough people, or something.
---
Thus way you can farm systems fine, but not have to be careful to not overfarm, _and_ you're still incentivized to rat there to keep ADMs up and the mil index at the optimal place for ratting
---
natural selection, he should have used an instant undock
---
Yeah but pirates don't fight, they just feed.
---
I nearly had a coughing fit from laughing, but yeah. Nice.
---
and an instant dock
---
I‚Äôm right there with you
---
Doubt
---
I mean why drop 1 when you can drop 80?
---
So what you're saying is that any damage originating in the proposed 'AOE cone' does less damage to ships in the AOE sphere, but only damage that's done to shields/armour specifically?
---
Honestly, I'd just stick with the first half. Nothing more than the AOE cone being a de-buff. A cycle-time in a similar range to large reps or large guns. Getting hit with the de-buff shouldn't mean you're useless in the entire fight.
---
You can't scan the cargo on a blockade runner. That's the point. And with a 2 sec align time. You're gone. Then you cloak. Bye bye.
---
I use Elinor. Still works, mostly. I think I'm using 1.1.2.0.
---
https://code.google.com/archive/p/elinor/downloads
---
So that was the reason! So is Discord likely to be overtaken by Mumble possibly in the future?
---
You don't have to lock onto your drones to give commands. . . .*drops mic*
---
About half the time it takes a helium atom to vibrate once.
---
And we still manage to Krab.
---
I mean would you consider 1.5 bil daily for 2 accounts PI chump change.
---
how long does it take you
---
I ran 7 clients no problem with 32g ram, upgraded to 64g just to be sure and because I don't trust CCP to not use all the goddamn memory in 6-12 months time.
---
UPS - now a wholly owned subsidiary.
---
Seems appropriate, after all, they favor armor tank.
---
1 joins 10 leave, great success

&gt; Indeed, many nullbears were convinced that they were legitimate professional gamers, engaged in an e-sport as competitive as any Minecraft creative build contest.

"I want an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin". 
---
"Do you have any idea how long that will take"?
---
Tbh, goons complain about this shit too.
---
Discord and Mumble are two different services with two different use-cases and purposes. They would complement each other rather than compete.
---
Cynos lit needs to stay. They're aren't tied to the fluid router network at all and the idea of being a beacon that your ship can lock onto and jump to necessitates that it should be discoverable through remote observation.
---
Bye 10 vni bots o/
---
The Makalu reference was obscure, but great for longtime vets.
---
Why did he have to make a new one. Also I have to remove Jeff and Grogoth from my bio now if this isn't the greatest bamboozle of all time.
---
Says ‚ÄúMade in Hek‚Äù on the label.
---
Simply by not providing target character ID but the ability to check their location and ship flying periodically   
---
solves the problem. Have fun running into a gate camp or finding a specific ship at Jita 4-4.
---
Well, the original idea was to make this be a modification to shield and armor command bursts (aka links), rather than a completely new module. But I'd be ok with making it its own command burst type, in which case it should indeed apply to all damage, not only damage done to shields and armor.
---
Drones ^(should not auto)
---
Discord permissions are funky compared to Mumble. Discord is ok for smaller groups, but for large groups I prefer the manageability of Mumble.
---
Been flying them on two accounts for a year and not even a scratch. Maybe I know something you don't know. That's probably the case.
---
He wants to know if his Klan meeting was recorded by CCP.
---
2 of the major ratting bots I know of currently don't work with the 64 bit client. And I bet some of the unmaintained legacy bots are the same.
---
&gt; Your skills aren't going to train any faster with that sort of time commitment
---
The vital BKAC (between keyboard and chair) skills will.
---
So in Eve how many people do you have on an open audio channel? Do you have entire fleets of pilots so everybody can here the command structure kind of like a military style system with 20 plus users listening simultaneously?
---
The new one has far fewer screens than I was expecting.
---
Don‚Äôt they already have it?
---
Yesterday we had 450 or so people in a fleet.
---
Now you're just being a meanie!
---
But I thought cyno's made the game too easy and needed to fixed...
---
Cloaky ship; force recon ;) without local they can be fucked easy by this
---
no idea what you are responding to, did not mention afk campers
---
Haven't you heard? This is the death of eve, no one in null is going to undocked. Krabbers won't mine or rat. Not gonna be able to get any battles because people won't be able to find each other. Using combat probes and D-scan are just too hard and too slow.
---
you don't seem to understand- it has nothing to do with BR versus yacht
---
in this situation, it wouldn't have mattered. I saw it happen.
---
I dont live under an umbrella. But yeah why count to the other guy when you can assure your safety yourself without the nsa. It s a choice. I choose to remove nsa
---
Didn't they lose seats in the recent CSM election?
---
OP is not a Hunter btw
---
&gt; Yesterday we had 450 or so people in a fleet. The largest fights in Eve have had thousands of players fighting. 
---
Jumping Jehoshaphat!! That's huge! Were all the players linked together on a single audio channel taking commands or do they have military units like troops or squads etc?
---
So what happened before the advent of ubiquitous third party audio software then? Eve has been around since 2003 and how did such a large fleet get coordinated back then or is this large scale coordination something that's evolved as the audio team chat software has become more widely adopted?
---
There used to Eve mod, they ve stop the development though.
---
I've noticed no more problems with the 64 bit version than with the 32, only the occasional odd glitch for both. So excited for this to be rolled out
---
I was giving my 2 cents :-)
---
Ask Grath
---
It's revenge for all the shit null groups have given CCP over the years. CCP came across some hubris   spewing you tube channels run by nullbears and said "nope".... Or maybe they said "null".
---
For clarification i found it was Eimar who made the image not dirk. My bad man! good stuff!
---
You are arguing with people who probably never traveled in eve without a nullified scout.
---
Back in the day, pilots in space, recent jumps, etc were all used.  
---
A look at the map would show you a route a fleet took in space.  Its not the Near2 stuff these 'elite pvper's will whine about, because that shit is a response to the power-creep in eve.
---
When your ship aligns slower than the time it takes to enter system, and probe the entire system of all combat ships, other solutions are found.
---
I‚Äôm not a part of this discussion, but who in their right mind joins a SIG to kill citadels in highsec? That‚Äôs volunteering for the worst part of owning space in EVE.
---
reeee i don't have or want a spotify account...
---
problem with that is you can't make every system equal you'd ruin strategic value of systems why try and take over a -1.0 truesec for your alliance with a 0.0 is just as good we need region specific resources(more then just some meta modules and loot/ice) things that will generate wars that have weight behind them instead of just "content"
---
Intersting....now residents won‚Äôt even know if a bad guy is mon their home system unless they  undock and scan. Is those the trade off for cloaky camping prevention??
---
I approve this message.
---
Oh no whatever will I do?  Use Jita like I always do?  The horror!
---
Seriously though, this seems like a weak ‚Äúpunishment‚Äù of highsec.
---
The other char slots from the account level normal ? Like 2x with omega and offline?
---
A couple of years ago a journalist wrote a book about Eve Online's community and how it's evolved over the years. Honestly, it's a good introduction into how Eve is played and a great read:
---
https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01DONPR0M/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i0
---
Um, super ratting will be just as safe if you're not a mongo.
---
just remove auto aggro from drones.
---
Is that right? I watched the 2013 documentary and to fair it's really good. I didn't know someone wrote a book!
---
The battles look epic and Eve is totally unique there's no question about that at all.
---
I have been able to get eve to run on every distro I have tried other than manjaro. Dunno what it was about manjaro but it would not run. Worked perfect on arch and debian without any problems.
---
Scorp was one of the first ships redesigned, and the drake was touched up too.
---
No just the fact that my fit has an EHP of 33,000 while his is less than half that. More than enough buffer time to dock if attacked. More than not though I'm warped before touched. You don't get it. Run the right ship first. Run the right setup second. Run with insta undock third. Always make them guess what's in your cargo. 
---
Best advice I can give.
---
I'd cut resources in all of New Eden by 1/3, or RNG the resources once per year to kick off a new war for those resources.  Example: One region could support a maximum of 50 Roquals mining 24/7 only.  That'll put a dent in replacing those supers and titans,  or make the large blocks try to own multiple regions (Goons already do tho so...) Also increase the amount of resources needed to build new supers/caps/titans by 25%.   Like the other thread identified, reverse the anomaly/ratting --- the more you rat in a system, the less pirate spawns occur, so reverse it - make players spread out and move instead of sit on one system for mining for years.
---
So that if by some miracle someone manages to get to your anom and apply tackle your bot can still warp out.

---
For like 2 hours a week?
---
yeah, so once again it has nothing to do with him not being in a BR, but having a shitfit and dying in a circumstance he shouldn't have been in
---
I get tired of seeing your alts mess up the satisfying list of blues in local
---
But suddenly constant client inputs are required from the bot, I imagine that would make it way easier to detect them.
---
Make sure your damage (including drones) is the The right type for the NPC rats that you are shooting. It makes a huge difference in destroying them fast. I wished someone told me that in the beginning. Took me 1 hr and 45 mins to finish a site when it should have been under 30 mins. Sigh.......
---
What false god are you talking about, there is only bob.
---
This is why you never trust wh shitlers on their isk/h.
---
The figures you see from nullsec are figures attainable from undock-to-dock time.  Isk in the bank.
---
Is that 350m/h figuring in scanning time? Nope  
---
Is that 350m/h figuring in looting time? Nope  
---
Is that 350m/h figuring in high-sec market time? Nope  
---
Is that 350m/h on demand and available? Nope
---
Great article! :)
---
agree, new player have the shittest isk/hour in EvE and certainly the less fun aswell   
---
1 : they don't know how to make money and think mining is a good idea, lmao  
---
2 : they don't have the skills for a better activity and probably not gonna have them before X month   
---
3 : exploration is boring (the less SP you have the more frustating it is) mining is boring PvE mission are boring, factionnal is boring...pretty much everything about Isk making in this game is boring AF   
---
the only thing a newbro can enjoy are incursion and every activity with others real players (good job with triglav "invasion" btw even if you fucked up the reward) fregate abyss pretty cool idea, active PvE with "intelligent" NPC and social 10/10 but the game don't give you any information about that   
---
i suggest to increase those social activity with good reward make them un-multiboxable (oblige players to change target frequently, same for logi) if you create new abyssal include much more players 5-10 players maybe? (i recommend a "scalling abyssal" like World of warcraft do for small scale alliance that way you don't refuse anyone)  
---
get rid of boring AFK-farming bring some new PvE activity, increase the payout of "active PvE" activity based on the time invested not just the SP a players have
---
i've seen a good idea about SP = increase the SP you gain in a activity you do actually, if you do some exploration per exemple you gain xx sp/m on exploration skills 2h exploration = 4h bonus SP something like that (don't count for capital requirement Lv5 skills)  
---
and the most important, in EvE you don't stay for the game it's boring, frustrating, soo damn loonnng, but the friendship you build playing it worth it, encourage them to join others players (with incursion or anything else social PvE/PvP activity) they will make friends and join their corporation and just for that they will stay
---
This conundrum is unimaginable.

I find it quite unfathomable.

Its like 'Whos Line is it anyways' but in eve form:

---
Other guy is correct, the other advantage is that the next version of macOS - Catalina - is dropping 32-bit application support entirely, so it means mac users can continue playing without having to worry about the game breaking on them.
---
It's 500 PLEX to sub an account and there hasn't really been any sale that would be cheaper to buy PLEX vs just subbing (especially if you pay the 12 months sub instead of paying monthly). There was a 50% off PLEX pack which made it cheaper to buy PLEX rather than subbing, but it's not by that much.
---
Its reception in the non-koolaid portion of this game's community must have eaten you from the inside then.
---
Can we have a bunch of them and have miniature fleet battles like battlefleet gothic? üò≠
---
You can always fit a warpcore stabilizer. Since you are in an inty you can warp off pretty quick if they point you. If they scram you then you hand to speed tank and fight it out. But to be under 10km still require some maneuvering. I was gonna suggest ecm but CCP nerfed that so it‚Äôs useless 1v1.
---

---
I've thought the same thing but there should be real benefits to having the high military index though. Or perhaps it should be an economic penalty for having a low one: If a system is unpoliced it should not only be rife with outlaws and criminals for you to shoot... it should also be rife with crime and piracy going on behind your back. That should have an economic impact as local crime bosses are strong-arming or bribing your customs office officials, shipments to and from the market have a few boxes "fall off the back of the truck". you need to pay some kick-backs and bribes to get things to happen. 
---
That way the incentive would be to keep a high index in the systems your really live in where you have markets and production facilities and are actively colonizing space... and other systems with low indexes where you hunt... for a bit before having to move on to the next lawless system that needs policing.
---
Still around, still completely community supported.  Please donate or buy something from the store if you have the means!
---
I got my first solo kill in faction warfare I think about 8 days or so after starting my account. So you can be useful in FW pretty quickly but you will die a lot. I bought some Plex so I could focus on PvP and learn instead of trying to make money right away which helped because I am PvP 100%.
---
Cruise missiles and sentry on a Rattlesnake with Vs kn appropriate skills will get you low-end carrier ticks, in the 35-40m range
---
Are you only fielding one ship? That's gonna cost you over a bil for all three accounts.
---
Anyways I did the math and without factoring insurance you'll need 27 hours of uninterrupted ratting to break even with a Myrmidon in a ratting Ishtar.   It's probably closer to 30 hours with insurance.  The Dominix fit you are looking at a lot more hours than that.
---
It would be interesting to see a W-Space alliance have individual corporations controlling all of the different systems in a W-Space constellation, thereby preventing them from grouping up. Has that ever been tried/achieved?
---
I'm down. I too also think tabletop as soon as I see these
---
I‚Äôm confused what your asking? 
---
I only rat on one account right now 
---
And if I get returns anywhere near what I get in a VNI then a Domi will pay for itself in around six hours am I missing something here?
---
tbf that's a good idea, but too easy. it'd have to exclude tackle or i'd simply run anti-cyno and tackle.
---

---
Then why don't they start bashing all your structures relentlessly?
---
But not asset safety, except for each one-man corp.
---
The other guy is right about the other guy being right they are moving to 32-bit often makes the game break and moving to 64-bit will help with that.
---
Back to my main point. He should of used a BR. I think I proved my point exactly how much better it is.  
---
1. Can't scan it
---
2. Twice as much EHP
---
And what are you trying to prove? That my facts don't exist and his chance of survival would have been then same? You're dead wrong. Run a proper fitted BR and he just increased his survival chances GREATLY! 
---
Amazes me how you can't see that.
---
because it looks to out of place in contrast to other ship. Its a slick design and it make sense but it look so out of place.
---
still hoping they don't give those gorgeous ships the same treatment as they gave to the chimera
---
Maybe your just trolling and baiting. That's probably the case. Because no one is that stupid.
---
Remove warp core stabs
---
&gt;Twice as much EHP
---
a yacht gets much more EHP than a BR properly fitted.
---
&gt;And what are you trying to prove? That my facts don't exist and his chance of survival would have been then same? You're dead wrong. Run a proper fitted BR and he just increased his survival chances GREATLY!
---
not in this situation dumbotron, which is my whole point
---
a BR is better for somethings, yachts other, but in this case, either way, he was dead.
---
the fact you can't see that, or even understand that's my point after saying it 3 times now blows my mind
---
put down the booze and apply your brain
---
They'd be fools to redesign the rifter in any way other than new textures/more polygons. 
---
It's the perfect ship, gorgeous and iconic.
---
Someone tell Kaepernik.
---
If you train up your social skills and run Level 4 HS missions, you'll get there fast enough... AND have a nice chunk of ISK as well.
---
Ratting in your staging is a really bad idea.  Which is why people who actually rat in null mostly rat in systems around their staging.
---
Oh so Plex is no longer a single item that gives 30 days, it's 2 hours per plex? Can you redeem 250 to get half a month of game time?
---
The hilariously large amount of posters posting there?
---
I‚Äôd have to look at it.  The one guy, brisc rubal, from init decided not to run again so maybe that‚Äôs the 4th you‚Äôre thinking of.  Olmeca silver took sort dragons seat.
---
Like, say, region locks on moongoo?  'Cause you need all of the goos to build T2 stuff.
---
Btw, guess what's already in the game and drives zero conflict because everyone is dependent on everyone else?
---
mmm salty
---
I heard he was part of this evil group called tissues that terrorized a group of innocent space monkeys
---
Yeah thats why i was thinking like a ewar ship that doesnt allow cynos within like 30km of it or somthing but it cant find any warp disruption mods. Maybe the skill for the new ship increases the range of the cyno disrupt
---
Because structure bashes are boring? XD
---
I mean cmon... everybody complains about the actuall nullsec. But hey you dont have to change it all at once (lets see what the blackout changes) and if we start discussing something like this because of a "realistic" or "lore" perspective of things: okay let the ADM shrink the number of anomalies AND add something similar to lowsec, highsec and missions because why the hell should the pirates send their ships into enemy territory to die if they dont do it in their own territory?
---
Let missions travel towards the pirats home system after you finished them first because: "What kind of spodbrain pirate faction would send thousands of ships and people to get wrecked?" that could actually bring some life to NSC-null....
---
There is a "hole" in the super cap umbrella... No help in the way...

Because asking if audio/text recordings are kept indefinitely in a place where text recordings are stored indefinitely in numerous places is a great idea.

---
Gratz or congratz or congratulations
---
I'm doing just fine feeling alone without the playlist, thank you.
---
No local means you can't see the blops coming until they are moments away from landing ;)
---
When you said you had 3 accounts I was assuming you were talking about ratting with all three. But since you aren't then yeah, 10 hours looks about right. The rough math I gave you is how many hours of ratting it'll take for you to break even with a Myrmidon that already paid for itself after 2 hours of ratting.  Assuming you won't die so you don't need insurance, that's 8 hours of Myrmidon ratting that you'll get as profit while the Domi is still paying itself off.  So that's about a 276m headstart on the Domi. Which means with that Domi you'd need almost 30 hours of ratting to make the same amount of Isk you would have in a Myrm.  There's a reason the people who AFK alts use Myrms.  They break even a lot faster so more profit per loss.
---
Haha you are clueless. You can't scan the cargo on a BR! That alone increases your odds! As I said in my first point before you took this to loony land with your dippy brain... he would have been better off running a BR. Just accept that and admit you're wrong.
---
Ahhh good to know so many choices which one to choose lol
---
Sweet.
---
Bro you literally right click + jump lmfao
---
&gt;more talent than your standard F1 pusher
---
Lmfao dude you are LITERALLY a worse F1 pusher than goon fleets - they at least have to move around and anchor and shit, you jump and seige and that‚Äôs the extent of your afk pvping
---
Yeah refer back to the second sentence of my comment
---
Probably, but introducing new problems without addressing already known faults will leave us worse. The eve way of life;)
---
Why do you think I skill farm lmao?
---

---
Yeah, no the point is we need it to take more space to earn as much. 
---
Less anoms overall. We want to force players to spread out of necessity, not from greed. 
---
The few good truesec systems should be few and far between, and very very valuable to encourage conflict and inequality.
---
You have always been a hater
---
*grabs sunglasses*
---
nice
---
This is the wrong sentiment for Null. You should not be safer the more you use a single system. Eve should force you to move around and just sit in one place with your super fleet next door.
---
&gt; You can't scan the cargo on a BR!
---
they didn't scan the cargo on the yacht.
---
oh yea the chimera is badly designed, at least the older model made somewhat sense.
---
Submit a GDPR request tbh
---
Yeah I quit because it was tiresome to move all my caps due to fatigue. I just parked my dreads/carriers with my JF in low-sec near the route to the area I was selling crap in npc null. 
---
I wish I had just stayed in wormholes but HK was kinda getting boring once Ayeson and debes left.(not throwing shade at noobman, we didn't interact much).
---
I really want to come back and play but just the thought of the sheer logistics in moving things around kinda kills the idea before I can resub.
---
I was always more interested in small gang stuff, kinda hoping that when I do come back I can find an active group of folks who actually pvp all the time instead of 6 days of pve and one day of blueballing ourselves.
---
I'm less excited(but tbh it was expected) to find that my little life savings of a 60ish bil isnt worth much now. How much could I sell a nomad or a dread for nowadays?
---
and First person view only
---
yes but if you close up on the top of the ship it looks very poor quality in contrast to the other caldari ship.
---
Here's a rough estimate: if you usually lose a ratting ship in under 20 hours of use take a Myrm.
---
First, you don't know that. Can't prove that. 99% of ganks are after cargo scans. Which clearly gives BR a plus. Second, more EHP on BR can easily dock up. Thus... once again... my first post. Better off if he ran a BR. Will that fact eventually get through your thick skull?
---
Too late.
---
We all know what you said that one time...
---
Wierd, I was doing solo dread escalations in c5's for cash and those netted me about 650-750m/h after you spent 45 mins setting up bookmarks on static sites. Are you talking about level 5 missions in lowsec? I thought those paid more.
---
Read quick, thought it said "no one blows you" and not blobs.... made a snarky comment to my wife asking if she's been on the EVE Reddit.

How long has it taken you to save up 100m?

Ratting locust fleets to clear out a backlog of systems stockpiling all the anoms
---
&gt;First, you don't know that. Can't prove that.
---
i was there ya fucking retard, as i said 10 posts ago.
---
&gt;Second, more EHP on BR can easily dock up.
---
this is flat out wrong you imbecile, a yacht doubles the EHP of a BR if properly fit.
---
can you stop lying and eating shit for one post?

Intel stucutures are going to re enable local for nullsec alliances
---
Here is a story from long ago... Somewhere around 2008-9ish or so my then-corp had a spat with a provi-block alliance Sev3rance and we cloaky-camped their constellation out of spite for a week or two. And one could understand when people used to NRDS didn't pay attention to local for a few days. But even into the second week we still had people x-ing up for fleets in locals with their mining ships, even links-orcas... one can guess what heppened to them once they would join a fleet they would be invited into in a camped down system...
---
People, especially those who are used to safety and choose safety as their main eve-activity, generally don't adapt fast or well. Even now, with the local and intel and voice-comms - people lose their shinies. And do not adapt, instead blaming others for their misfortunes. What is more likely, I think, is them rage-quitting...

---
Olmeca's winning attribute is persistence.  It's an impressive and commendable for him, but the fact you have to get on that level to achieve anything isn't a shining endorsement for the game or its direction.
---
It's also worth pointing that whatever affect he had even objectively measureable was still nothing but a nuissance to a group who've still managed to build the largest supercap fleet the game has ever seen
---
Someone else could have scanned it. And sure the yacht can get better EHP but you'll loose the mobility. Thought we were talking about cargo running fits and now you just want to sit and tank. LOL 
---
Think you need a break from Eve. You're so sensitive about being wrong. Jeez little girl. If I knew your panties would bunch up like this I would have ignored you 11 posts ago.
---
I agree the current system is dumb.   It should work the other way around, or at least peak for awhile, then decline.   I always thought it would be cool as you cleared out the pirates out you could move civilian npcs into your nullsec empire and they would start to build stuff and maybe you could tax it to offset the lack of ratting?   And if your enemies wanted to, they could attack your civilians, like in a real war.  ..and you would also have to patrol your space, because maybe the pirates would try to comeback and attack the civilian structures as well.
---
moogoo is far from region locked although many regions lack a specific goo its just a matter of blueing the guy next to you and blam you can either purchase or access all the mats you need or if you are goons or test just take several regions to get everything they need aside from things strictly sold by NPCs
---
They should probably make it so that you can't drag it to a regular cargo hold.
---
So should targeting resolution
---
depends just how fast you go

You are all remembering wrong there were actually no low sec fights before moon mechanics changed. In the words of someone wiser than myself "skill urself".

I'm part of the team that designs and programs those live production video switchers.

I'm by no means a video engineer, nor actually an engineer of any sort.  I do the low-level software stuff, i.e.  software and part hardware things like:  firmware, operating system, device drivers, USB software installer (an OS of its own), etc.
---
It's lifeless tech until I've awakened it, and then others teach it to perform all the cool video magic.
---
I know its a big part of the lore but I honestly just haven't seen the game in that way since my first few weeks playing. I see about a few dozen core game mechanics, about 100 ships, a few hundred ways of fitting them, then the political/interpersonal aspect layered on top. Immersion into the lore just doesn't come into it.
---
Another worm. Other than that as novice plex there simply isn't anything that can take it on unless you go max tryhard mode - shiny dual rep dramiel maybe succubus with crystals. It also really depends on the worm fit - if its active tanked with crystals then other than polarized DD nothing will break it in novice.

It's game-over for Amarr. They're fireselling everything from their garages.

Even CCP is saying this may be temporary, null has always had local, and I don't think it needs to be gone totally and forever, if the null folks want the safety it provided, they are going to work for it.
---
Assuming they don't just call you a fag and say fuck you, which is usually the response I get in low sec. Null campers are much more likely to actually respond positively based on my experience.
---
Not always, I've had a couple of good experiences in low, but if you go through low on a weekend I wouldn't necessarily assume you'll get a good response.
---
Instead, I'd recommend joining one of the big newbie alliances like Pandemic Horde or Brave Newbies (or whatever). Even if you only stay in for a week or two those groups have lots of people who enjoy helping new players and plenty of fleets to get your feet wet in PvP. Also in null you don't have to worry about security status or gate guns, and you get to experience the wonders of bubbles and stealth bombers. You can always quit these corporations once you figure things out or want to try something else, like FW or wormholes.
---
Running through low isn't the worst way to do things, but most people you encounter are going to be in small gangs and/or tech 2 ships that will insta-lock you and destroy you in seconds, and the only real tip is "scout gates and pray lag affects them more than you". I'm not entirely sold this is the best way to learn pvp.
---
When did I say that?
---
Many people bring up the good counterpoint to this... there should be a reward to actually using your space.  
---
If eve 2.0 could be a thing, i propose variable system security indexes, because static security indexes are boring.
---
How it would work:  
---
\-1.0 space = feral rats, think of the current drifters, but diamond rats. Rats have their own structures (with no reinforcement timers or damage cap, limited to a certain number of type per system/constellation/region, and structures offer certain bonuses to rats like: size of fleets, number of 'response fleets', types of non-military fleets (mining fleets, convoys that can be ambushed on gates and drop stuff))  
---
as these rats are killed off, it decreases the security rating of the space, and therefore the percentage of bounty, number of sites, etc.  
---
eventually a system reaches security status 0.0. Now players can anchor moon structures, TCU/IHUB, and regular structures without instant rat aggression. Further farming will continue to increase the security rating and therefore lessen the payout without increased investment in infrastructure. Instead of pirate detection arrays, replace those with Upwell mission agents. (i would think that handcrafted mission by CCP could possibly serve as a way to combat bots effectively without becoming gimmicky)  
---
null space should never turn to lowsec or highsec mechanics, even if the 'security rating' goes into lowsec or highsec equivalent ratings. As the level increases, the number of 'natural' isk faucets decrease and the number of infrastructure required faucets increase, but can be balanced by reduced payout for highly farmed systems (after all, why would an Upwell agent pay you top dollar when there's another capsuleer in line behind you willing to work for less?)  
---
the biggest downside to this idea would be the potential for large groups to have to spread out. Honestly that isnt entirely a bad thing with how empty space currently is. Further changes would be needed to round out the game as a whole, but i for one would love to see something more than warp-&gt;shoot-&gt;warp-&gt;shoot-&gt;warp-&gt; shoot and oh look, money every 20 minutes.
---
was this announced or is it conjecture
---
Grinding to level 5 missions is painful. I've quit Eve twice doing this. I would recommend it.
---
Been playing it for like 2 months. Wine is your friend and as far as I know no winetricks magic is needed. Default install should be ok. I am on wine version wine-4.0-rc2
---
We have a krab in our corp who has a seed in every system in his region (the sites spawn a fixed number per region, not constellation).  Something like twenty accounts with 3 alphas on each.  He logs the alphas on regularly to despawn sites from the other holes so that he can get respawns in his own farm.
---
If you are a faceless drone in a null block it's probably by choice. Nobody forces you to krab all day. At least none of the ones I've tried.
---
Localappdata is where your launcher login details and UI and client settings are stored.

No way to actually figure out what is what in that jumbled mess.
---
I 2nd this. The first time I got killed by a helpful pilot he gave me 300mil, 5 t2 breachers, and told me to join Pandemic Horde so that I would learn all the stuff they already know. Besides a wealth of information you get skillbooks &amp; plans, free ships, and just a lot of better industry access. Best advice I got as a new player.

Exactly. My only thought would be a kiting garmur with snakes which just keeps it perma pointed and orbits it. Kill drones first and stay out of range, hope it's rocket fit.
---

---
I had not thought of this but; yes. Very much yes
---
Thanatos
---
Nope, not for what you want it for.
---
I would like to see an inverse relationship between the indexes and low value resources in a system and a direct relationship with higher value resources. Make it a true farms or fields rather than every system is both.
---
For a low military index the number of sites would be large and the level of sites vary greatly. The respawn times would be long thus encouraging you to come pick among the fields in several systems every once in a while. At Max index the sites would be much less and only low level. The higher level resource that would become more available would be DED sites. The better the index the more common and higher rated the sites would be. This would be the Farm version of military indexes. It would reflect the covert nature of the pirates trying to retake the system.
---
For a low industrial index the fields would be more common and larger lower tier asteroids packed into smaller fields with long respawn times. Higher industry index would remove the lower tier dense fields but would  spawn fields with higher tier asteroids but they would be smaller and more spread out requiring more micro managing but a more valuable yield. Additionally moon fracs in systems with a high average industrial index over the life of the frac would receive a bonus to the chance of a better frac.
---
Thus you have potential reasons to want to leave an area as a field and use it less and different reason to want to farm something as well.
---
Farms would essentially be very useful but for less people on a consistent basis but with periodic strong rewards for a few.
---
There is not getting rid of them... they just come back. Lose a few sub caps when they insta spawn on you in an anom and insta blah you. Call in some supers to kill them, lose a few fighters and back to doing what you want
---
Minus your sub cap until it happens again. The loot sucks and they erase ships without a chance to survive unless it‚Äôs a super or rorqual what part of that cycle is fun

The panel display is only for configuring the switcher, which is rarely done while 'on-air', so it serves more to show the operator what the switcher is doing.  A show will usually use many pre-configured 'custom control' macros, activated by a keypress, to perform multiple actions for a given video effect, even robotic camera moves and triggering other video devices.
---
A control room will typically have many monitors, to watch all video (well, as much as possible) coming in and going out.
---
There are typically so many video feeds, that large monitors are split-screened into '[multi-viewers](https://2wk12w2dk3733zyjdf3secd9-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Carbonite-Black-MultiViewers.jpg)'.

What the fuck did you even try to say there?
---
&gt;Having local only available to them allows them to do their current warp off / recall excavators nonsense
---
Which as I've stated, is a moot point, as we're arguing the availability of local to the hunter
---
&gt;while also allowing them to blob/bait hunters with relative ease
---
Let me just refer to something you wrote a reply earlier:
---
&gt;Because nullsec needs to be less safe, not more safe
---
So it seems to be working as intended, no?
---
I caught cancer watching this.

Unless you value your time less than $1 an hour,  buy PLEX for $$$ and sell for ISK.
---
Mining in hisec, with two Hulks and an Orca I'm lucky to clear 50mil an hour.
---
I like mining, and I can read an e-book while I'm doing so... But there is no point in doing anything you don't consider fun to generate ISK.
---
If you can't even afford Omega let alone some PLEX, you need to quit EVE and get a job!  :0)
---
you know that new players do actually join eve every week...
---
1) 4 gates in a freighter. 
---
2) Switch to jump freighter.
---
3) Jump to remote PI location.
---
4) contract 1/3 to other toons each.
---
5) on those characters load onto epithals and transport to planets. 
---
6) nothing for next 23 hours.
