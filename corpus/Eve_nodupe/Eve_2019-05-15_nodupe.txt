If you have a fleet of 20 stealth bombers, how do you keep from uncloaking each other in warp or on landing? I assume you'd just uncloak each other all the time. Is there a best practice to trying to keep everyone cloaked?
---
---
---
I own a black character
---
This is the simple answer. Most sites deal less than like 6-750 dps, well in the range of a passive drake/myrm/praxis. Bombers allegedly can do it, either using like 20 bombs and a good warpin, or cycling torps a couple times before they point you.
---
I bought it way back in the day, been in relative storage ever since.
---
All structures (ansiblex gates, cyno beacons and jammers included) can only be anchored to moons. One structure per moon.
---
Great thread thank you!
---
Whos got  the checklist?
---
Nice work Phoenix bro, thanks for bringin' it.
---
That's actually really amazing, keep it up!
---
Come join eve uni!
---
Sure so in this it s useless.
---
It's not a grace period. Your cloak hasn't activated yet. That's the whole point.
---
Eventually people get bored of rorq mining and super farming for titans and more supers to sit in for hours of 10% tidi. Hopefully they all stop playing.
---
Well see it that way would you be more proud of the castle you build even if its a small castle or the one of your employer even if it is a big one? You can look at it in two ways the absolut value of the castle or the personal one. Again your choice and there is nothing wrong with just being content to live in a castle either instead of building one. 
---

---
For me personaly I don't like being just a number I like to put in the work and see the fruits of that work even if they are a LOT smaller than Mittens.
---
From the anniversary items I have hats and shirts that I can't figure out how to wear or equip. They're in my item hold currently. How do I wear them? What are they for if they cannot be worn?
---
Yo what the fuck
---
Rate of fire bonus also makes the SNIs rapid heavy fit that much less effective. The damage-per-clip is really important if you’re brawling with rapid heavies.
---
The phoon fleet gets the dankest rapid heavy fits as a result. You can literally bring a 100k who battleship close to structure in a single clip in those things.
---
That last bit is what really bothers me. There's no counter to "just dock up" or "just run away". Am I supposed to take pride in the fact that I've "disrupted" their PVE? That I made someone log off and stop playing the game while I also afk? Is that the satisfaction I'm to get from EVE?
---
PvE should be something to fight over. If I'm unable to steal the spoils, if there's no treasure, how can I be a pirate? At least the ESS did THAT part right, even if it was a shit implementation.
---
Damage caps are there to allow for a response time, allowing them to be repped doesn't really solve that issue as the repping would in and of itself be a response.
---
I've been having this discussion for well over a fricking decade now, explaining it on the forums, in rookie channel and in youtube guides. Heck Uni wiki uses my old video explaining it. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
And still to this day people don't get it, never tried it and have no clue.
---
Delet this.
---
Lmao imperium members thinking they'll get to shoot non structures
---
Shit, your right. How could i make such a simple mistake. They also vibrate every time a cap dies!
---
i think drone focus fire should be removed. What place is it used besides PVE? When you are jammed I guess? Otherwise you’re assigning drones to a bunny, or putting them on a target.
---
Bots will probably just spam f or whatever, but at least it’s something
---
Revert to whatever patch was right before citadels got added. Seems that a lot of people that I’ve talked to enjoyed those days. Sure there were annoying things, pos roles sucked, but overall it seemed like a more fun eve
---
The interceptors that lost nullification get a role bonus that makes the pilot not show in local.
---
&gt; it's not clear from the Jestertrek AMA that CCP has any product managers.
---
Ugggggghhhhhhhhh this explains literally everything. Eve feels exactly like any other software with development guided by mid-level manager idiots who are trying to do a hundred other things at once. 
---
This explains the massive variation in UI quality/design, the half-baked and abandoned features, the legacy code rot, the "we'll fix that last bug eventually" bullshit, and all of the other things that show a 95% finished product that's ignoring the 5% of effort which makes everything worthwhile.
---
CCP needs to get the fuck out of iceland so have a big enough available employee-pool such that they can hire people who are worth their paychecks.
---
Fun fact, my old char replies in that thread :)
---
You’re in a c4, so there wouldn’t be avengers? Right?
---
You're actually just super wrong.
---
it's more that neither option is all that appealing tbh. ( having done both to some degree like I spent my fair share of time in small groups, sorta why I feel the difference is being oversold ) 
---
Don't get me wrong right now I get the occasional fun fight that keeps me invested enough to well login, but the trend of those is definitely going down not up.
---
Same. POSes were much more interesting from a gameplay perspective. And citadel grids are fucking broken, so you've got crap like boosh ravens that have basically no counters.
---
... You really thought they wanted you to log in and out 16 times one after another? What would be the point?
---
Even if you thought that, why wouldnt you try claim all of them on the first day and forget about it rather than waiting until the last day?
---
Sure. For first year or two. After that it just sucks monkey balls. Though I guess fun is per person subjective, I have a very strong feeling that if it wasn't for so much scanning bullshit and a added gate here and there, then wormholes would be a hell of a lot more populated.
---
make all ships warp and decelerate 100% faster
---
Structure spam is insane, and I really do respect NRDS, even if I've had negative experiences with it.
---
my god
---
That was the first thing I tried, because that's literally what they wrote.  Instead I appeared to get one day's rewards.  Since it said several times I didn't have to log in consecutively to get a day's rewards, I assumed it was similar to other games that do this kind of reward, and the reward is per day depending on which day you log in.  
---
I can't be the only new person that was confused by this.
---
the r is for raven
---
Check the in game logging. Not your combat log - go to the in-game logging and set it to info. Watch the logs. Your mwd is not activated after your cloak is. They activate on the same tick as your velocity decreases.
---
I kinda like TC3s, even though I feel like the jackdaw and the Confessor need a bit of a nerf. The Hecate and the Svipul feel pretty nice.
---
Seems like a pretty normal flex to me.
---
Who's harvey Skywalker? Does he own a lightsaber?
---
&gt;  to delete it. Just delay it by 30s or so. Hell, I'd say to delay it by 10s per 0.1 sec below 0.0, so that more valuable space is also more 
---
IMO it should be delayed just enough that a ceptor can cross a system. Or maybe ceptors should be completely immune to local. Flimsy as they are, it would provide just enough delay that fast hunters can get tackle on something, and then the rest of a gang can catch up.
---
Why are shields automatically replenished when you dock? Is there any reasoning in the lore?
---
&gt; n this game. Hauling, wormhole, capitals, mining, even some small gang pvp
---
 
---
Frankly, i don't have much of an issue with that. Credit card warriors tend to be subpar players, and easy killboard fodder.
---
Yes, the native Americans said the same thing when Christopher Columbus first arrived in America ain’t it?
---
I agree with your dislike of caps, but I feel like that ship has long sailed. And there's no real way of re-distributing wealth without upsetting a large portion of the playerbase. I would just want caps to be more vulnerable to subcaps. Even after the recent fighter nerfs, carriers are entirely too powerful against small gangs, and they should be defenseless against a bunch of frigs.
---
314/100
---
That's a hard yes from me, on that account. I play on a single account, and a single character, and it precludes me from a wide range of activities.
---
~legacycode~
---
Probably because they regen naturally while undocked and it's one less thing to keep track of.  Lord wise maybe docking injects your ship with energy and as a side effect the shield is recharged because docking also fills your capacitor.
---
Or any solo PvP kill that is larger than a frigate
---
I think that is a pretty high average
---
Is it still broken? They must not find out I am there ...
---
But timers are always there to allow for a response time. Aren't timers enough already? If you know the time of the attack, and the size of the attackers, what stops a large entity from just showing up and defending while repping? The attacking force would have to kill the logis before dealing with the structures, and that's just more stuff dying.
---
Matias, your old alliance still has fun, we have fun, r/eve isn't really representative of the entire player base just like the eve o forums aren't.  You should go hang out with them or us and see what's up.  This reddit is literally full of monday morning quarterbacks right now, go draw your own conclusions imho.

I get it. It's because it sucks....
---
Re write the game and take away legacy code. I stopped playing when I realized the game is limited and the huge battles they portray on their trailers are not really what they are. TIDI needs to go asap.
---
True, the only saving grace for the SNI is the Fleet phoon can't tank like the SNI. So while the phoon might be able to get close to killing a BS in a clip, it'll die during reload. While the SNI can tank thousands of DPS while it waits for the reload. 
---
I still hate RHML. It could be interesting if one of the caldari BS got a reload bonus like the jackdaw though. Would give them an interesting niche, so while they don't have a high damage clip, they reload faster and get damage back out faster.
---
Recode it in C++

Remove capital ships from low-sec.

Can you repost it? Saying an error occurred when I click the link

Give Logi credit on kill mails.
---
The Gila does over power calm sites. It also gives you the chance to work yourself slowly into the sites with a good margin of error. It doesn't take very long to start running T3-T4 sites so having the Gila already fit and ready is probably a good idea.
---
Make those tiny crosses in the top right corner of every window a lot bigger. Seriously. This is the thing that shits me the most.
---
Been away for a few months, interceptors lost nullification?
---
Ask for two then:
---
Asset Safety is paid to the alliance(s) that did the most damage.
---
A way to make is so the more citadels you have in a system the higher the damage cap somehow without it being abused.
---
you have a full second to activate it. I've done this dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of times, and I am not wrong when I say I can consistently time pressing two buttons that are directly next to each other within one second.
---
Why on earth
---
Fix the economy. That means removing capitals or having a planned (secretly) market crash or something massive, if necessary.
---
As with any people that reside in a space for long enough have a reputation, people with reputation could be a way to vet people, looking into corps/alliances that have suddenly appeared runnin for CSM would be looked at harder I would assume. 
---
A null sec alliance running a covert high/low sec candidate even a 1 year old toon in shell Corp/alliance and such would still show what can they fly where those ships have been if they have had them etc etc. 
---
The biggest part I think would be being able to perform consequences from ccp to the people in charge of misleadingly promoting a csm member to the extent that it out weights simply running a null sec canidate would be important. Specifically in game, sense there are no contracts irl I assume simply running for csm, it would not  bother anyone really running for csm legitimately and a acual deturent from overrunning csm with a false canidate.

The combat ones yes, the tackle ones still have it
---
defo cheating here, but i would reduce the length, number, and span of timers across the board. the length of time it takes to ref ihubs and citadels, even when uncontested, is a joke.
---
CCP is normally pretty generous to active duty military and vets and whatnot. good example is if you've been playing the game long enough and your account is paid for but not training because of military jobs they'll give you that SP
---
So few quick questions:  
---
\- What is your reasoning for choosing a nanofiber over a heat sink, and polycarbon rigs for energy locus rigs? Is speed and agility that important on this ship?  
---
\- Many people claim that a defensive web on a snaked succubus is more important than a defensive scram. What is your reasoning for the scram over a web?  
---
\- If you decide to swap over to pulse lasers, will your fit chance at all?
---
"Fix lowsec" counts as one thing?
---
If not, I would make the BPCs for subcap Pirate ships only drop from rats in lowsec belts (well, maybe some lowsec exclusive combat anom aswell), just like Mordu's Legion ones, but divided by the regions each pirate faction "controls".
---
It’s been like that since what, late 2006? That’s hardly a new thing
---
I'm reading this from the perception of a new player, and it makes me sad. They need to understand they're competing with games not from 16 years ago, but games made today. So much of the game seems dated and doesn't convey intuitive information.  
---
Icons are such a good example of this. Most of them aren't intuitive in Eve at all, and modernizing them to a point where you can look at them and known what they mean goes a long way for new players.  
---
There's literally hundreds of little things I need to learn, it's not because I'm dumb, it's because 1) I'm new and 2) the game doesn't do a good job an conveying information.  
---
If they want Eve to keep growing and be relevant, this needs to be fixed.
---
The player numbers disagree.
---
Make local work like it does in wormholes.
---
Even CCP can't scam their customers that hard
---
Wait selling it in WH? I usually mine gas in WH, didn't think to sell it there.
---
How do people find market locations in WH?
---
At least you can queue an underway/deployment worth of skills now.
---
Add local to wormholes
---
Cloaks should use fuel
---
I mean, if you're in a reasonably active corp, you really don't have to scan all that much at all if you don
---
Question for people that sit at 0 in T1 cruisers on HAW dreads, why? Do you think that your Thorax will, for some reason, be an exception to the laws of butt fucking in eve?
---
That is an argument that would make sense.
---
No, but I remember you feeding Capitals to a PH sig up there.
---
Hats!
---
He stumbled over the question for over almost a minute, so it would've been too long to include the question and still make a great clip, but basically the question was "Do you think CCP really understands why players enjoy the game, or are the sorta out-of-touch?"
---
Can’t CCP seriously just analyze wallets, active time, and then idk spawn a gm in system to monitor behavior and intercede the botter, confirm botting going on.  Insta ban.  
---
????
---
scramming frigate rats in every anomaly and on every nullsec/lowsec gate. Make EVE dangerous again.
---
Well that'll do it. I swear I heard of old stories of it happening back in around 2007 but maybe something changed, or I'm just misinformed. 😁
---
Thanks!

What kind of creature enjoys activities like that? How nasty do you have to be? And how is it possible that it took that long to deal with something like this?
---
&gt; "Every alliance worth anything should have a programmer." Veritas was a great guy, but he was completely dismissive of small alliances and felt that every alliance worth anything should have a big full time staff, including what basically amounted to an IT department. I never could convince him that there should be a place for smaller alliances.
---
This. I am surprised they are not supportive of smaller alliances. That needs to change.
---
I often wonder what can be done to break up the blue doughnut. Even a half dozen factions (or more) instead of two big groups, I feel, would be great for the game.
---
Should have invested it all in Plex.I tell this to everyone planning on leaving
---
not going to lie, first time I didn't follow the arrows and had know idea what was going on.
---
This would make so many people happy. I can't imagine why someone would be against this idea.
---
Eliminate alts. One character per player.
---
That sounds like a good way to make people quit when they have to krab more.
---
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is Eve Online today.
---
Wow that all sounds like making things more tedious but not actually dangerous at all.
---
“God damn, I’ve got a hulk grabbing my Bhaalgorn”
---
Set maximum amount of ISK you can suck out of a single region so people will have to move their arses around more to make pve , which will resut in pvp.
---
This is what happens when boredom insues. Prob bait.... "fuck it"
---
Shit.  He's onto us.
---
Also cool that major alliances can do the IT shenanigans to get those SIGs talking together. Authorization, discord integration, etc.   
---
Props to the IT folks out there.
---
Id make a gate to Stain.
---
&gt; 1. I understand WH sizes and that any caps built in C4 or lower will be stuck in there until they die. That’s not a concern, so if I built a carrier in a C4, would it be able to run the sites at all or do they really blow up your fighters before you can wipe the NPCs off the field? Also, is there any way to cheese this mechanic with a heavy Ewar ship that sleepers would primary or maybe a Logi ship to rep fighters?(can you rep fighters?)
---
Eh, you could maybe use Carriers for C3s and below and not lose too many fighters, but the common occurrence of webs in Wormhole sites and drone aggro does mean you'll lose more fighters than you'd like. Also, in C5s and C6s, warping a carrier in will trigger an escalation wave that will murderzone a carrier
---
What using Logi and Ewar might work to pull aggro, there are more efficient ways of using multiple accounts (like Tinker Rattlesnakes - go look it up)
---
&gt; How much time and effort does it take to get an industry character trained up to be able to build a carrier from scratch? Is this a realistic undertaking for one person?
---
All you really need is some basic industry skills to get the Capital Shipbuilding prerequisite. Of course, hauling all the capital components in from Jita would probably take more time than its worth, so you might want more better skills to speed up the pipeline though it's totally doable just by one character. 
---
&gt; I believe an Azbel is the proper structure I would need to build caps? How long is the build process for a carrier or a dread and thus how long I’m going to have to keep the structure alive to prevent my cap from being destroyed before it’s complete?
---
Use an industry calculator, like FuzzySteve's https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/blueprint. Generally speaking, it takes roughly two weeks to build a cap, though this can be longer/shorter depending on skills, structure rigs, etc. 
---
&gt; Are carriers useless in C5 capital escalations? Even just for applying DPS to the drifter BS after the small shit is dead? Can BS track fighters?
---
Nothing says you can't, but a Dreadnought is a lot better at this. 
---
For other Wormhole PvE questions, refer to Karr's Modified Rykki's Guide https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSbMMEBlM5BAFXldnnX3GDGfUp02OAuMznRljKkbpH4Ff3SyNTrkyEjHSJGkNJsDPqypSZw3sQmQ1Ta/pubhtml#

Eve Online 2.
---
The way that isk has devalued in terms of game time but most generation methods havent scaled accordingly. This means people who pay with isk are less willing to throw away money in fights, and.makes things a little bit more stale.

Otherwise im just kind of a bitter vet really

If you have the cosmetic item in the station with you, you can click on the sidebar to the right to customize your character. Your hats and shirts should appear there and you can add them to your character's appearance.
---
I probably made most of the ISK at the beginning with skill books on the market back before you could just buy them from anywhere (it may sound weird but i was buying crap loads in NPC stations and selling in Jita sometimes at outrageous markups). The other highest source was relic sites in low and null.

---
warping caps (carriers, dreads, fax) into a site spawns avengers. the cap-escalation you dont really want. massive ehp for basically no blueloot. warping a carrier into a site (apart from it getting murdered and beeing completely useless because the fighters get murdered instantly too) would just mean you get less isk/h
---
c4 sites in general are garbage. plan on running c3s(rattles) or c5s(rattles, dreads) if you want to do pve.
---
building caps in a c5 is kinda unnecessary out of the ''i want to build it myselfs just cause''. You get more than enough direct LS connections to buy/get caps faster, cheaper and easyer than building them yourself.
---
Not that I recommend it, but VNI ratting while watching TV
---
Thank you for the straight forward answers.
---
You can see markets in WHs if you're in the same system as them, and you have access to that market.
---
Which basically never happens. OP probably made a mistake since WH gas isn't used for drug manufacture, making it more efficient to just react it out in null.
---
It would cause large ones to steamroll anything small and nearby. And long term it would cause everyone to move their staging to npc nullsec/lowsec
---
The ones that went from pets to loot piñatas when asset safety died
---
I never imagined making a billion isk until I moved to wormholes. Now I can team up with a friend and we can both leave with a billion after just a few hours of ratting. So definitely wormhole C5 sited were where my first billion came from.
---
looting wrecks in faction warfare space.
---
&gt;You don't know what % of the permabanned accounts in the top 25 alliances make up the total % of permabanned accounts, but you presume to speak anyways on it.
---
The total amount of bans is irrelevant when we talk about who are banned the most. We know that frat and skillu are among those banned the most, we don't know what percent of bans they are, but why do we need to know that?
---
&gt;You are saying that they are "the first or second worst botters in the game" but you have no proof of that. These are banned accounts that have been reported to CCP.
---
Yeah you're right on this point, from the given data they are just the most likely to get permanently banned. I'm not sure if that makes them better or worse though
---
&gt;But perhaps the biggest and most disingenuous point of all: You are completely missing how the overwhelming propaganda war from TEST/Legacy hinges upon accusations of FRAT botting a lot. This is IN SPITE of the fact that TEST/Legacy directly support XIX/RED (i.e. the biggest historical RMT/bot alliances in the game) and have sheltered Wing's Wanderers and KWG for years knowing that they bot but not stopping to collect their rent checks. 
---
I've been purposefully not being led into a tangential conversation about other alliances. I don't have recent information on these other alliances. I hope ccp starts making data available on a ytd basis but so far they haven't so I can't talk intelligently about these other alliances. The only other alliances that we have somewhat recent information on is skillu and to a lesser extent (through the ban wave callout, not any statistics) imperium
---
Btw, when your defense is "look at these guys who I imagine are maybe doing it too" you don't have much of a defense, it's more of an admittance
---
That doesn't mean they activate on different server ticks.
---
Trust in the rust.
---
Delete all capital ships
---
Is it frowned on the loot other players wrecks there?
---
Fewer goons.
---
I'd rather not do away with the best solo nomad ship in the game.
---
What's so bad about them, exactly?
---
people will try to kill you but you can escape if you pay attention.
---
Thanks, i appreciate the response. 
---
So cap escalations really aren't worth the effort?
---
Unfortunately you hit the nail on the head with the whole "i want to build it myself just cause." seems I'm better off just buying a couple dreads and jumping in a C5 to make capital then i can fuck off and waste isk on building shit or something.
---
Im just starting my eve journey. I can only hope my experience are half as good as yours.
---
 I experienced the same feelings when I first started playing WoW as you described when you first started playing eve.
---
I have lvl 1 cloaking and not very good ships I can "fly" battleships and battle cruisers I'm not sure why I trained them I can afford them yet and I doubt I'd be able to fit them properly.
---
What's a vni?
---
maybe you'd have more fun playing Elite Dangerous.
---
I've been trying data and relics in high sec and got 11.6 mill after several sites but couldn't scan down a lvl 5 site tho.
---
Would a catalyst be got for salvaging behind unsuspecting players? And ok I'll keep that in mind lol.
---
Yes, I'm aware that citadels are hard to kill. I think they got the balance wrong -- asshouses and the other small ones should not exist, and instead there should be a class of more disposable things that are like a POS in cost and capability. 
---
That's a judgement I couldn't have known before actually seeing the things in operation for a few years. Nobody else knew either. CCP absolutely had to balance on the side of sandcastles, because getting it wrong could kill their game. Sandcastle builders are just as important to their bottom line as kickers. And given that some people had specifically been pushing for destructible stations because "it will force people to fight" aka get bullied, they kinda had to be conservative.
---
Add more solo content so i dont have to rely to others too much to have fun. I only chill while mining atm while waiting my skill que to completed , not a fan of PI or exploration but i like pve ratting or missions, i am still new to this game so never pvp yet but want too in near future, i was stuck in null corp before and do nothing but mining or some standing fleet forming and no action, gate camp bubble, etc null life just too stressful to me. Abyss sounds interesting too. Other weird ideas from me :
---
1. I just wish we can create our own home on any planet and no one can wardecc it because i dont want build it and someone wardecc me and just destroy everything like a station.
---
2. Space pet for our ship, create a new career like a scientist or something to research and develop DNA for a new pet for our home or bring it inside our ship.
---
3. First person shooting action on any planet or station.
---
4. Created a pub where owned by NPC corp where you can play a game (roll dice or something) with isk for SP (idk if this exist yet or not cause im new).
---
5. Oxygen meter for all ship, produce with a machine or something.
---
6. .Pvp duel for isk or SP. If you lose then the winner get isk or SP.
---
Idk i got lot more ideas and i know its sounds silly and impossible for this game but whatever. Just my two cent.
---
in FW space you usually use an explo frig like a magnate for cargo capacity and align time.
---
Yeah, in the market and through capital/super capital production.  Playing the spread between buy and sell orders in a super vibrant 1DQ coalition market.
---
I'm down. Too bad Spring training is over, that'd be perfect.
---
If your interested in wormholes just join a wormhole Corp. The typical setup I and a lot of us use is a group of Nestors, which you May already be able to fly. C5 sites are fairly easy with 3 Nestors, some of our people can do them with two, but I’ve tried and not me :)

To be efficient with them you do need to max out you scanning skills and hacking skills. Also use sisters scanning module and probes. Data sites are not worth as much as relic either, and sansha relic sites are probably the one that are worth the most isk if you get lucky. The only data sites that would worth are the Covert sites but on those you have to be really fast, sometimes you can get 2 of the cans before the NPCs blow it. You also need to be on your toes and GTFO at the first sight of an NPC warping in as they will scram and blow you up before you realize what’s going on.

Warr Akini of Miniluv fame held a pod-killing contests for newbies.  I tryharded for a couple weeks and managed to snag both a prize for 2nd most valuable pod, and (I think) most pods killed.  Something like that.  I got 2b for the effort.

I have a normal vexor someone gave me I dont know how to unlock t2 stuff.

Gals can put this on in states that only ban images of female nips for a loophole
---
VNI is faction and alpha pilots can fly them. They have better bonuses but cost a great deal more then the t1 counterpart.
---
Do you have any suggestions for a medium sized corp that is newbie friendly and is active at night I play after work and I work 4 to 12 30 or 1 if i take a longer break. That's Texas time i think its central.
---
Gas yourself (ingame)
---
Oh ok I have one of those I've been using to data sites I'll look into it thanks.
---
&gt;The total amount of bans is irrelevant when we talk about who are banned the most. We know that frat and skillu are among those banned the most, we don't know what percent of bans they are, but why do we need to know that?
---
The fuck? It is still very much relevant you enormous goob. Do you not remember the enormous bot waves that were running couriers/mining in apocs from a few months ago? How many of those banned accounts were in alliances? How many bots are in alliances? More statistics is always better.
---
&gt;The only other alliances that we have somewhat recent information on is skillu and to a lesser extent (through the ban wave callout, not any statistics) imperium
---
*skillu*? What the fuck are you even on about? Do you think PBLRD belongs to skillu?
---
&gt;I've been purposefully not being led into a tangential conversation about other alliances. I don't have recent information on these other alliances.
---
But you are willing to speak with authority on who has the moral high ground with botting claims?
---
&gt;Btw, when your defense is "look at these guys who I imagine are maybe doing it too"
---
Not just imagining, but are actively participating all the while and we have no reason to believe that they ever stopped.
---
&gt;you don't have much of a defense, it's more of an admittance
---
You missed the entire point of my post, so let me spell it out to you:
---
1. TEST/Legacy allege that Frat is covering up botting and has a near racialized propaganda war that got so intense their agreements with Mango came with a "we want a public apology" comment.
---
2. They claim moral superiority but have given shelter to two of the largest botting/RMT alliances (RED/XIX) and taken rent checks from 2 prominently bot riddled alliances as well (Wings + KWG).
---
3. Claim moral superiority while aligning with Mango/SePIBC, an entity that was known for gaining an upper hand in Serenity by bot workshopping and were the biggest contributors to that over there.
---
So in sum, any argument in the propaganda from TEST/Legacy's side is hypocritical at best and you're an illiterate cretin or borderline sealioning.

Someone donated it to me my 2nd week playing in 2013 and told me to pay it forward when I could.
---
I think it's reasonable for CCP to make a small concession like you say. What I don't think is reasonable is the entitlement that you're showing toward what is essentially a gift, and it certainly isn't reasonable to set out to "fight" customer service reps.
---
You have to drop a mid for a TP for application (still worse than rapid heavies but acceptable) but you trade that for avoiding the awful reload time of rapid heavies, which imo you often canot afford considering the timer you're on with limited 3200's.
---
You kinda need to green the bcu's to make the dps not awful whcih is another downside but worth it I think.
---
Yes. It makes that glorious noise every time he takes it out to entosis.
---
Roll back to the last iteration of dominion.
---
The same thing has happened with many of the small gang corps in the game. For my Corp I know we just all grew up, got out of college and started jobs. We play other games together but no one really has the time for EvE anymore.
---
Oh, I'm sure he is THRILLED with the promotion to mining director

I'm pretty sure you are.

---
Made nearly 2b in under 2 weeks running combat sites in highsec farming faction spawns, escalations, and unrated/ded sites.
---
One of the big things for me is that I would need to completely redo how I made isk if I left. That means more injectors most likely, or some painful standings grinds, or something else, all of which would be less afk and less lucrative.
---
also, I hate market pvp.
---
for the first 2 bil: scanning for relics in low, but actually making 95% of it from the special timed "covert research facility" data sites found along the way
---
next many bil doing relic sites in wh... scanning in from lowsec, which mostly yield c3 that have not been picked clean yet by explorers as ones from high usually are
---
The developers working on it have to play at least 15 hours of it a month.
---
I think if that was a reality we'd see a lot more than just one good change.
---
order can matter within tick rate, you know?
---
You're remembering correctly. It was changed some time in the last decade.
---
the corp he is part of, Pos Party, is a good start. Kind of like Pandemic Horde in null they will take anyone who has a pulse. If you can sit in a Gila and can use T1 medium drones then TDSIN would probably take you, not that it would be much of a step up these days
---
Fuuu amazing
---
In fweddit we have a lot of people willing to teach people how to earn isk. /u/casmeron is our essentially our best person in this regard and is always willing to lend a hand. In fact they are the one who taught me how to earn isk! 
---
I personally find ratting exhausting and don't do it, but we have sov and several of us (in ORGNC - our Alliance) do indeed use it. **Additionally**, we basically SRP everything. Lose a dread in a fleet? Insurance + SRP = full replacement. 
---
Here's our [discord](https://discord.gg/0kCRVItfTl2qAwf1)

I would make that Freero Oksaras had infinite isk and infinite omega play time.
---
Jk, i would make t2 frigates available for alpha players, and also cloaking devices.

I see them nips
---
This breaks the rule of 'jusr ok' this would fix the game.
---
I see you too are a man of culture.
---
Yeah, I used to make 20b my first 3 months playing.
---
Just from donations?
---
&gt; The fuck? It is still very much relevant you enormous goob. Do you not remember the enormous bot waves that were running couriers/mining in apocs from a few months ago? How many of those banned accounts were in alliances? How many bots are in alliances? 
---
it doesn't matter because of the relevant alliances that players can take action against fraternity will always be high on that list
---
&gt;More statistics is always better.
---
i agree, i look forward to having a more accurate accounting. 
---
&gt;skillu? What the fuck are you even on about? Do you think PBLRD belongs to skillu?
---
their rental alliances also made up a large part of the recent bans that we know of from the released statistics
---
&gt;But you are willing to speak with authority on who has the moral high ground with botting claims?
---
i only speak for myself, i thought that was pretty clear
---
&gt;Not just imagining, but are actively participating all the while and we have no reason to believe that they ever stopped.
---
i have no information that they are doing it at the moment and i prefer not to condemn without information. the recent information is only available on frat and skillu because they recently made their alliances.
---
i hope we get more information in the future, ill have the same feelings towards the people who bot the most regardless of their alliance
---
&gt;You missed the entire point of my post, so let me spell it out to you:
---
ok thanks, sometimes i can be dense
---
&gt;TEST/Legacy allege that Frat is covering up botting 
---
i'm not sure that frat was covering up botting, but we know that they are and have been botting now so that's irrelevant.
---
&gt;and has a near racialized propaganda war that got so intense their agreements with Mango came with a "we want a public apology" comment.
---
do you have any links for me? i don't think test/legacy are racist groups.
---
and while it test/legacy racism isn't relevant to the conversation we were having
---
&gt;They claim moral superiority but have given shelter to two of the largest botting/RMT alliances (RED/XIX) and taken rent checks from 2 prominently bot riddled alliances as well (Wings + KWG).
---
how does this relate back to elo selling out and joining his prefered group of botters?
---
&gt;Claim moral superiority while aligning with Mango/SePIBC, an entity that was known for gaining an upper hand in Serenity by bot workshopping and were the biggest contributors to that over there.
---
isn't/wasn't botting tolerated on serenity? i admit i'm quite ignorant here but it seems prejudiced to judge a group based based on presumed future actions
---
&gt;So in sum, any argument in the propaganda from TEST/Legacy's side is hypocritical at best and you're an illiterate cretin or borderline sealioning.
---
look around, it's just me and you here in a deleted thread, why are you trying to talk about test/legacy propaganda?  it's simply not relevant to the conversation we were having
---
test/legacy has nothing to do with the conversation we're having
---
let's refocus, we seem to be lost
---
the facts as i see them: frt are botting, a lot. elo supports those botters
---
my question: how much did it cost for elo to discard his morals?
---
the answer seems to be: but test has allies! look at test allies!!
---
Ok thanks I'll check those out.

During one of those guardian gala events a few years ago, I choked the Hek market for accelerators and marked them up at twice what I bought them for.
---
Thanks for these links. I really dislike them, because they are just further confirmation of why I gradually quit playing myself: It always seemed to me that it was the players, not ccp, that were ultimately killing the game.  Most people would rather join the biggest, most secure group, and have only uneven fights, than ever take any real risk that comes with the only real true thrills I think you can get out of eve. I really don't think there is anyway ccp COULD do, to force players to have smaller localized conflicts, despite the fact that they were what made the game fun when I started in 2007.

ship explosions cause damage to other pilots lol.. that would mix things up a bit
---
if my business isn't worth it to them that's fine.  I don't know anything about being special.  If i was buying hundreds of dollars of stuff at the grocery store and they told me "nah you can't use the 20$ off coupon because its expired by one day" I wouldn't grocery shop their anymore.   Probably a bad analogy because the margin on food is relatively small and their loss on 1mil sp is like 2$ of the support person's time, which they pay whether they give it to me or not"
---
I'm preparing for if their default answer is no.   I'm not sure its entitlement, I would have gladly followed the terms of the promotion if they displayed the correct information to me.  I just want to the 1mil sp that people familiar with these events are going to get.
---
This is amazing work, thank you for sharing!
---
Sounds like a personal problem to me vO7
---
How else do you get attention?
---
Basically, it's what we did when we had supers burn to a location.
---
None shall pass. I like your choice.
---
You're in BL how do you not know this?
---
cat ears
---
I'd reimagine titans and supers to require more than one pilot to function.
---
Titans would function mobile weapons platforms with one navigator (who also controls the doomsday) and several gunners who each operate a turret.
---
Supers would function as motherships where other pilots can spawn and grab a ship from the fleet hangar. The navigator would also have control over some ewar or links to influence the battlefield.
---
Thanks for all the effort you put towards making EVE a great game for the time that it was.
---
Multi-box 5 Ventures and an Orca and fly the Ventures out to the asteroid to mine and come back and drop it off in the Orca.

The first maybe 3 bil was donations from being a newbro fc, I actually told people to stop and returned some donations. I flew a noctis around salvaging, and bought firesales, moved them in an iteron to one of our staging systems, and had it jfed to jita to be sold. I would check contracts non stop for good firesales in our area.
---
I've got to finish cleaning out that closet to make sure they aren't in a different box. Much appreciated :D
---
If I'm not mistaken, supers were initially planned to work like this, and were even called "motherships" once
---
How did such a dumb motherfucker get into a position of leadership?
---
Make mining boost ships have no bonus to mining drones.
---
and we can get unicorn mounts for our avatars. and they should be flying mounts and we can fly them on planets. and add stables for pets in stations.
---
I like the idea of reinforcement timers being linked in some way.  If you reinforce a keepstar, all smaller citadels in system also get reinforced, for instance.
---
selling regular caracals as navy varients, upgrading to ravens for navy ravens. with the changes ccp has made to the trade window, it might make this more difficult in this day and age.  
---
There is always corp theft, isk doubling, running wormhole sites or just grinding out missions until you want to die.
---
Agreed.  After downtime your cloaky campers automatically log in again and cloak.
---
i wonder if making "local" into "region" would be a decent step? bots who dock when someone enters region wouldn't be active very much.
---
The man is a moron. What can I say?
---
"Hey all super pilots click this link to instantly teleport with your supers and titans across Eve to our objective instantly."  
---
So. Awesome. /s
---
The reason timers aren’t enough is quite simple. Structure hit points divided by alpha of dread guns. You drop that many dreads and the structure is alpha’d with no chance of reps saving it. The counter to this would be to have their HP be astronomical but then how do you kill said structure in high sec? How does anyone who can’t drop a full fleet of dreads kill anything? Every argument I’ve seen posted on reddit has flaws and the current system has its own. Heck even a keepstar can be killed by spamming a few dreads at a time and keeping the dps at cap until it is dead, since you can’t rep it; No matter what the defenders do short of cyno jamming the system. And ansiblex cyno jammers are a whole other bag of worms more oppressive than any reinforcement timer on a structure. TLDR it’s complicated and simple answers won’t get you the results everyone wants. It’s just more complicated than that.
---
That's exactly what I said.
---
You feel entitled to special treatment because you spent money.
---
Yeah, I learned the hard way then. I don't get how people are so against everyone being given rewards without having to click a good boy for logging in button. You guys are seriously depressing.
---
Yes but this post was brought on by big nullsec blocks harbouring characters that are able to play the game at nearly max skills after day one, and it only takes about an hour to farm back the investment into a vni. L4’S weren’t that good to begin with i started my career missioning and lost a ton of ships to the low sec missions that were offered. But lets think through this, If you put a lvl four cap on drone skills for alphas, they can still use faction drones not T2, some would argue they are about the same. In anoms four drones is still a 12 ish mill tick, but at least not 18-20 like you would get if you had lvl 5. 36mill an hour, i would have played for that money when i was starting out. So the new player experience isnt really hampered in any meaningful way, but its about 30% less isk in the pockets of botters.

"Only no lifers that live next to their computers with internet should be allowed to get these rewards! Yeah, fuck everyone else. Anyone that thinks otherwise is entitled!"  
---
This is how you sound. You must be fun irl. One of those no taxes for the hard working mega millionaire people I bet.
---
I'll admit I don't have a lot of data to back it up, so it's mostly a hunch.
---
The intuition is based on three things:
---
1) Sales of SP are essentially flat since January, even as the price has increased 25%.  This suggests to me that demand for instant SP is pretty inelastic.
---
2) As soon as the unit slug of plex was decoupled from "30d subscription token" and also replaced Aurum, the price of plex rapidly started diverging from what a previous rather slow climb.
---
3) As you pointed out, the extractor market is sufficiently competitive that the cost of injectors on the market has become approximately equal to the manufacturing cost.  (I suspect the current state is a combination of various sunk costs if you're farming on alts which don't need more SP but need to be subbed anyway and the market shock you highlighted.)
---
Prior to nuPLEX, the price of PLEX was actually pretty tightly coupled to what a broad base of high net worth individuals could farm in a month.  On one side you had people who didn't want to grind for ISK, and on the other side you had people who didn't want to pay hard currency, and people would exchange game time for the profit of a month's baseline farm.  Some people would also buy extractors to sell for ISK in much the same way, depending on which got a better exchange rate at any given time.  However, it was relatively difficult to directly exchange ISK for Aurum, so you needed to have people paying hard currency for all the ingredients of a skill injector, with the manufacturer only assembling the final product.
---
After the PLEX/Aurum rework, the necessity for many of these third parties were removed.  Now, you can put up a blanket buy for PLEX which is then used to both purchase your extractors and use that to keep your account training.  This both decouples PLEX from the marginal product of a subscription *and* more tightly couples the price of PLEX to the price of extractors.  That's all kind of ancient history, seeing as it happened approximately two years ago, but watching that happen informs a lot of my thought process.
---
There's one assumption that I didn't particularly state, though, and which may be wrong, though: This all assumes that the marginal product of a high-net-worth account has not significantly changed through the recent dramatic increase in PLEX prices.  If I look at evemarketer.com, which gives 1 year of history, it looks like PLEX was stable at around 3M p/u from april through August of last year, with it even trending very slightly downward across the summer.  Since then, it's gone up about 35%.  I don't think the marginal product of an account has gone up 35% in that time.  Did I miss an implication of some balance change last fall?  (The only thing I'm spotting is the Triglavian event.  I suppose it's possible that that is still driving an increase in expected monthly character revenue today by shifting priorities, but the filaments were released in May to no immediate effect.)
---
As an aside, I didn't think to ask before: when calculating profitabilty of SP farming, what mapping and implants are you using?  IIRC, going from +4 to +5 implants makes a huge difference because the margins are so small, and the ratio of that capital expense to monthly operating expenses has been getting smaller.
---
Login requirement rewards are stupid af tbh.
---
That artwork is nothing less than AWESOME! +10 to the artist. Can you imagine being on that planet and having that ship hovering over you?
---
Not sure what you mean there. 
---
To VNI rat join an alliance like Brave or Horde, buy a VNI and for it with 5 heavy drones, and for a new player active shield tank is probably best. Ask in the alliance you join for an exact fit and you’ll probably get 5 different ones to look at.
---
I use this every. single. day. Every single warp off a gate when I'm hauling I use this.
---
You can do exactly this thing you're saying can't be done.
---
*Maybe* on the server side this happens on the same tic. I don't know about that - but on the client facing side? I get between 2-5 seconds depending on my luck where *after* the cloak is flashing green I can still activate modules. Such as an mwd.
---
There's a very important reason *never* to do it the way you're suggesting it has to be done. If the mwd is active before the cloak, an instalocker can lock you even faster than normal. That's why you *cloak* first, mwd after.

[deleted]
---
&gt; Any tips
---
chill and realize that 1 million SP is nothing in the big scheme of things, and that buying plex to "get ahead" was already just setting yourself up for disappointment.
---
if you are actively enjoying the game, a couple years from now you will be nostalgic for the times when 1 million SP was super meaningful and kinda wish you could go back to those days.
---
on the other hand if you aren't really enjoying the game now and are playing the skill training game so that you can get to the fun part with titans, quit now and save your time and money. it's the same game no matter how much stuff you have.
---
Honestly, they could fix so much if they just made citadels easier to kill and easier to defend. Ditch damage caps and repair timers, go back to pos style triage repairs with longer reinforce timers for larger citadels and less variance at higher adms. Low power citadels have no reinforce timers, no resists, and no tether. Just like unfueled pos, except you  still have the great proverbial diaper of asset safety to keep the little guy's 500 billion in shit 100% safe.
---
Garnish with some simple changes. Combine TCU+Ihub. Modest nerf to panic duration (maybe 5 minutes at max skill) and another nerf to anomaly spawn rates to spread people out. 
---
That's basically all it would take. I'm in favour of the idea that floated around for awhile of being able to hire npc miners from friendly factions to mine your athanors for you, to reintroduce a content driver but give it much better and more interactive harassment potential than the siphon units were. But that's a whole other basket. Just make citadels easier to kill and tie them a little bit more to the space they are in.
---
Not everyone is next to their computer with internet 24/7. My friend had a 3 day birthday trip that happened to land when this event started. I now have no buffer left. There are people that are in the military, go on trips, don't have internet or computer access every day.   
---
It's a bullshit tactic designed to make CCP login stats look good and the amount of people defending it is genuinely depressing.
---
A friend of mine sent me this today
---
Exactly, so what's the point? Just give out the rewards or give a bigger window at least. People have real lives. Kind of insulting to people in the military, or have families, don't have internet access 24/7, go on trips, etc.

Not sure why you've been downvoted so much. Their advertising was extremely misleading. All it said was you weren't required to have consecutive logins to claim, which to most people means you can just claim it at any time.

"It's free because I already paid for it." lmao

Sounds like "it's free because I mined it"
---
yeah when i started i said "I think I'll quit once i get a battleship, that's going to be my endgame"
---
5 years later I've got 7 omega accounts and am almost done training for a titan on one of them
---
i would certainly recommend getting a second account though, if you play Eve for a few months you'll want one and realise you could've been training one this whole time!
---
You can just use an alpha for now but getting omega on at least your main and then on your alt should be a goal so you can use them at the same time (I'd recommend buying a sub because unless you know how to make really good isk (like 1bn+/h) trying to plex your account is gonna make you hate the game).
---
The people who only have local friends and for that think they kind of superior always say that online friends aren't friends, funny thing they are the first to cry that everyone left them and that they are alone.
---
I mean yeah, you’re trading your time for value mining. Free in terms of your existing assets in game. Makes sense to me
---
I checked one of my old corps a few months ago after it closed about 2 years prior. Of the 35 or so heartbeats in the corp, only 3 were still playing. That's a big drop.

with my injected 18mil sp I can fly tech 2 caladari cruisers which I have no skill points in and nothing else t2, and missing amarr and mimnitar ships almost completely.  Mainly it was just the basic skills plus some of drones, missiles and shields, and most importantly hacking.  I just didn't want to grind missions at 1mil/hr for 100 days starting out.  With plexing I couldn't even afford to lose a t1 kestral.

You may have a different process in your environment, but I practice backlog grooming inclusive of leadership and exec stakeholders. Leadership will have ideas, and will influence your backlog. As product owner you engage with them to ensure your roadmap (&amp; backlog) is aligned to the wider strategic vision.
---
Where did it touch you ?
---
i started sub EVE since 2009, this year may be my last year for this game. CCP forcing everyone to have more than two accounts for proper gaming experience and capitals everywhere, lacking of subcap content. Missing the 2012 - 20115 era. And thank you CCP for screwing this game.
---
&gt;their rental alliances also made up a large part of the recent bans that we know of from the released statistics
---
Their renters are ex-renters of XIX, turns out renting space out in distant dronelands is very attractive to botters/RMT players.
---
&gt;i only speak for myself, i thought that was pretty clear
---
Comically missing the point. Keep up sweaty
---
&gt;i have no information that they are doing it at the moment and i prefer not to condemn without information. the recent information is only available on frat and skillu because they recently made their alliances.
---
You enormous goob, their names are on the chart of the top 25, it is well recorded that UaxDeath and others in the XIX/RED leadership have engaged in botting/RMT before, there is years of information going back if you use the three brain cells rattling around in the hollow coconut you call a head rather than belabor a point.
---
&gt;i'm not sure that frat was covering up botting, but we know that they are and have been botting now so that's irrelevant.
---
Every alliance has botters in it, and every time they are uncovered accusations fly about leadership condoning it.
---
&gt;do you have any links for me? i don't think test/legacy are racist groups.
---
If you're going to split hairs this badly, it's a generalized anti-Chinese sentiment that has been percolating for a while now.

---
&gt;while test/legacy racism is of interest for other reasons it's isn't relevant to the conversation we were having
---
How is it not? It is poisoning the well 101, which is clearly working based on how much you're banging out your posts right now.
---
&gt;how does this relate back to elo selling out and joining his prefered group of botters?
---
1. Every alliance has bots in it. This means that:
---
2. Everyone in an alliance that is associated with botting in any form is therefore hypocritical.
---
3. The TEST propaganda war, which has hinged upon Frat's purported botting nature, finds itself in its own crosshairs when anyone stops to consider their relationship with XIX/RED and -WW-/KWG.
---
&gt;isn't/wasn't botting tolerated on serenity? i admit i'm quite ignorant here but it seems prejudiced to judge a group based based on presumed future actions
---
It was """tolerated""" because of the unique nature of Serenity itself, i.e. changes of policy at different times led to botting becoming more prevalent as time went on.
---
&gt;look around, it's just me and you here in a deleted thread, do you see any test/legacy here? why are you trying to talk about test/legacy propaganda? it's simply not relevant to the conversation we were having. test/legacy has nothing to do with the conversation we're having
---
See points above about poisoning of the well
---
&gt;the facts as i see them: frt are botting, a lot. elo supports those botters
---
The facts as you are not seeing them: bots are in every alliance. Every leader of these alliances, by your own measure, are supporting them.
---
&gt;my question: how much did it cost for elo to discard his morals?
---
Key issue with gooblords like yourself, you can't imagine ever doing anything without the promise of isk. You have no idea why we are in the South in the first place, and bang on and on and on about the same tired shit over and over again.
---
&gt;the answer seems to be: but test has allies! look at test allies!!
---
The answer is "TEST/Legacy claims of moral superiority are unfounded" because Fraternity's renter alliance "Frat Treasury" is in the same position as Wing's Wanderers and Kids With Guns were in. TEST has additionally allied with XIX/RED, historically huge botters and RMTers, while also attempting to deflect and play up some weird Sinophobic angle (except when they're sucking up to Mango) about the Chinese botting menace.
---
The fact that you can't suss this out from the posts that I've made makes me think your parents must have had butterfingers when you were an infant, or they used you as a bowling ball at the lanes every Friday.
---
&gt;also, on sealioning: you keep giving more information that don't refute the two facts that are relevant to the question i asked. i'm not asking for the information you're giving, you just keep giving irrelevant information, i wish you would stop
---
"how does this relate back to elo selling out and joining his prefered group of botters?"
---
"wait no, don't give me stuff that implies my point of selling out is incorrect."
---
...
---
Burn the heretic.
---
Kinglon?
---
For supers only if plated and for a titan yes i think.
---
**Hisec:** Mining, mission running, or station trading (buying cheap in one station, selling higher in another)
---
**Lowsec:** Faction warfare Plex sites (not to be confused with PLEX you use to subscribe) or exploration
---
**Nullsec:** Mining, ratting, exploration
---
Since you seem to be very new to the game I'd suggest starting off with missions (and don't forget the [Sisters of Eve epic arc](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Blood-Stained_Stars) to learn more about the game) or joining a new player friendly alliance like Brave, Pandemic Horde, or Eve University, which will give you access to nullsec and better moneymaking opportunities as well as lots of peers who are learning the game together.
---
Malaka! ♡
---
Didnt look like you used your target painter much either
---
Maybe they create some sort of new ammo type which can be used for a higher DPS cap against POS (or anything else with a dps inhibitor) the trade off being you cant use it against flying ships and you can reload/change ammo types until you either dock up or expend all the ammo you currently have loaded. on the flip side they could do the same thing for ships with some differences. slightly increased damaged however it destroys all the loot you would have otherwise gotten with regular ammo
---
The woooosher has himself been wooooshed.
---
Me personally, I joined a new player alliance and killed pirates in asteroid belts with a catalyst until I trained into a VNI. Then I used that to make some baseline money that I spent on market trading. I bought loot that people sold for cheap in my home area and exported it to Jita, and bought doctrine ships in Jita that I imported to sell to my alliance mates. Back then there were some good market websites that let me find deals pretty easily, but I'm not sure how many of those are still around now.
---
These days I have a few alt accounts that make money while my main account focuses on pvp. Some alts are in VNIs (because they're a relatively low risk/low investment way to make AFK money) and others do exploration (because I live in the south, which has unusually good relic sites). I still often use that money to fund market trading just like when I was new.
---

Those are T3Ds, not T3Cs. T3Ds are fine since they are decently specialised, it's T3Cs that are broken.
---
I know, I'm just worried about the general design direction the game has been heading. I would it to still be there when I come back, you know?
---
yeah but how much does a single tracking link increase  your ISK per hour? I'm willing to bet *not a lot*
---
Men only want 1 thing and it's disgusting
---
Anything compiled and modern would work. C#, Java, fucking Scala or Haskell, I don't care. 
---
Stackless python was a huge mistake. They could have gone with Erlang and had better long-term results besides that it's nearly impossible to find developers for erlang.
---
Salvage behind titan, super, carriers you will make 100mil per hour easy. Most guys dont grab faction loot so that is a bonus
---
As a hunter, fits like these are really annoying, I'm expecting you to be in the same place for 20s dammit!
---
Good analysis...
---
Like in a fleet or ninja salvaging?
---
remove local
---
I played PPO for a bit when it came out, to when they added the... third set of islands? IMO the fact that people couldn't just warp off was amazing. your ewar 'mechs' and such had the ability to run people down and slow them down much more easily, so because of small fight sizes, it was tactically a lot more interesting. Plus because you were never nearly so far zoomed out, you actually go to see your appearance regularly.
---
Sounds good I'll look into those ones some other people have mentioned brave and pandemic horde. What's Braves full name?
---
I thought that they USED to run another in-space event alongside the agency event.
---
They also had (previously) tried out making you shoot something to get the rewards, but they removed it b/c people got mad about it (it was kind of annoying, and also favoured some playstyles over others).
---
Who are liberty squad?
---
Make citadels not able to defend themselves unless they are agressed
---
Not really. I started in late 2007. There was a shit ton of local conflict, small gangs, and small alliances that owned single constellations, and had NIPs with a lot of other local alliances, resulting in just constant small fights and brawls. This went on at least through a good part of 2008. 2008 was a damn good year in the dronelands, till IRC dumpsterfired.
---
Didn't they already announce that?
---
Not sure if you're trolling, or really that out of touch with reality.
---
I'm sorry, I'm still not over that first part....
---
It's in Killmail MKII. No word since they mentioned it on when they were gonna release test mails

the fits are a little overkill i think. I mostly semi-afk tier 4s electrics while working (come back every 4 minutes to grab loot, recall drones, and move to next room). 
---
This fit works great for semi-afk t4s. I use the vespas because they're harder to kill than the hammerheads which are better damage but the need to go back to repair them isn't worth the effort. faction vespa works too and has more ehp.

Hate to tell you buddy, but the 2nd largest alliance in the game is strategically blue to you and is fighting on your side in these battles

If you want to include frt on ourside, then include gotg on your side
---
Not really relevant to you but belt ratting and getting a lucky day of faction spawns. Before anomalies, wormholes, etc. I wouldn't recommend it now.
---
I put it into a carrier for skynetting and eventually that's how I hit 10.
---
In terms of liquid isk I would usually only keep around 10 on hand but I wound up piling assets like you would not believe over the years, which eventually funded me on my return to the game.
---
If I were you I would start daytripping wormholes in a battlecruiser and look into exploration. I'm pretty sure a gnosis can do low tier holes and they will be pretty cheap thanks to the event. As a solo players, iirc, it pays out similar to vni ratting, which is the baseline for isk generation in the game (60-80mil/hr), and is not subject to the harsh npc corp tax rate. Experience in wormholes will open you up to the much more lucrative ways to do them. Furthermore, consider joining a wormhole corp who is willing to show you the ropes.
---
There's another efficient option if you don't mind paying ccp a little. Depending on how far along you are you can look into the buddy program thread on the forums (google should take you there, "buddy invites and rewards from other players") and make another account. I have an offer there (post 45 from char Cnda Adian if you are interested) as well as many others, browse for the best deal. Look for the ones that will give you the plex accelerators etc they get when you sub that account, which is around 1.5bil total. Plus recruited accounts get 750k free sp, which might mean you're not even that far behind your current character. Keep your current character training to use as an alt later on, or continue to use it as a main. Honestly, it's the easiest way by far to start out in the game if you intend to sub at some point, plus having the 750k free sp to distribute yourself once you've got some experience already means you can spec it into stuff you know you want to fly. But for reasons I can't understand people just don't seem to like making new accounts.

Because the only reason for these rewards is to artificially boost login numbers.

&gt; Their renters are ex-renters of XIX, turns out renting space out in distant dronelands is very attractive to botters/RMT players.
---
&gt;&gt;i have no information that they are doing it at the moment and i prefer not to condemn without information. the recent information is only available on frat and skillu because they recently made their alliances.
---
&gt;You enormous goob, their names are on the chart of the top 25, it is well recorded that UaxDeath and others in the XIX/RED leadership have engaged in botting/RMT before, there is years of information going back if you use the three brain cells rattling around in the hollow coconut you call a head rather than belabor a point.
---
as i said i'm only talking about recent activity here. as you said their previous renting bots have switched alliances. xix/red name on the list implies they were at some point in the past many years supporting bots, the info doesn't say anything about their recent behavior
---
&gt;Every alliance has botters in it, and every time they are uncovered accusations fly about leadership condoning it.
---
in frats case ccp gave information of frats botting
---
&gt;If you're going to split hairs this badly, it's a generalized anti-Chinese sentiment that has been percolating for a while now.
---
what are you trying to show with these posts? it's a public anonymous forum, maybe it's me though, i don't keep up with who is who on reddit, are these users not anonymous? is there some anti chinese sentiment on reddit? yeah, does that make test/legacy a racists group? no
---
&gt;How is it not? It is poisoning the well 101, which is clearly working based on how much you're banging out your posts right now.
---
the relevant information was provided by ccp, not test/legacy
---
&gt;Every alliance has bots in it. This means that:
---
&gt;Everyone in an alliance that is associated with botting in any form is therefore hypocritical.
---
&gt;The TEST propaganda war, which has hinged upon Frat's purported botting nature, finds itself in its own crosshairs when anyone stops to consider their relationship with XIX/RED and -WW-/KWG.
---
what i'm hearing is: everyone breaks the rules, so to compete we have to break the rules best
---
that's a valid point, if people aren't botting they're falling behind those who are. if ccp isn't going to do anything about it then i guess that's how it is and the best botters will have an advantage. i guess i just thought there were some people who didn't think like that
---
&gt;Key issue with gooblords like yourself, you can't imagine ever doing anything without the promise of isk. 
---
i made no mention of isk, payment comes in many different forms
---
&gt;You have no idea why we are in the South in the first place, and bang on and on and on about the same tired shit over and over again.
---
if you care to tell a story i'm interested in why you're in the south
---
&gt;The answer is "TEST/Legacy claims of moral superiority are unfounded" because Fraternity's renter alliance "Frat Treasury" is in the same position as Wing's Wanderers and Kids With Guns were in. TEST has additionally allied with XIX/RED, historically huge botters and RMTers, while also attempting to deflect and play up some weird Sinophobic angle (except when they're sucking up to Mango) about the Chinese botting menace.

---
if the answer is "everyone is botting and ccp isn't doing anything about it then we might as well get ours" that's a fine position to hold, this problem does fall to ccp, not to any player.
---
i guess i was just confused as i held some people in higher regard than others
---
&gt;"how does this relate back to elo selling out and joining his prefered group of botters?"
---
that was the original question, not an additional question
---
&gt;"wait no, don't give me stuff that implies my point of selling out is incorrect."
---
"others are doing it so i might as well get mine" is selling out though, or maybe the morals were never there and it's not selling out, it was just hypocritical to post daily delve botter awareness threads
---
I want more filtering options, such as ships lost in specific wormhole classes.

Ransoming Navy Ravens ratting in null back around 2008, every other system had one and they would happily pay. Then when I had a few billion to keep the vagabond supply rolling, I was free to go and farm them all. Happy Days.

IIRC there is a way to do it.  I think it involved a rig that increases prop mod duration or some such
---
It looks enormous.

Delayed Local

Probably if you wanna run T5 too

Why was this done

Haha pirat

As a null sec person, I miss POSes too. Just a better way to play the game. 100%

&gt;"... orbit highsec holes at 0 and dive the moment any real opposition hits grid "? Don't give away the secret of our doctrine. Our agents would revolt if ever they understood that we have one.

---
Nobody said that. Braxus would even laugh at other idiots claiming that HK was unevictable, or that a WH Voltron would repel a nullseccer invasion.
---
Nobody actually tried, because no wormholer, not even an anti-HK WH coalition had the numbers. Init easily had the numbers by themselves and they still batphoned the rest of their coalition.
---
eve dead by 2025
---
Yeah, really hope it's not another feature never to be heard again from after they announced it.
---
Delete all supers
---
You mean DKP? Dragon Kill Point? That was never a meme. It was to divide loot between the dungeon runners. With every dungeon and Boss you got a Set amount of points you could use to pay for dropped items
---
Yeah, its be great to have, but understandable its take time as it's a whole rework of a back end system that doesn't have any major gameplay component changes. Meaning it's probably a spare time project for a few people. But if any devs wanna chime in here and correct me... hint hint, cough cough, nudge nudge.
---
In all my years in EVE I have never come to love lasers. I can’t even really tell you why.

Dont rat in a VNI, it's incredibly boring. You will orbit a space rock for 20 minutes while launching your drones and they autoattack your targets for you. At that point you may as well tab out and shitpost on reddit or something.
---
Most newbies are told to do this by the old vets but what they dont tell you is that they have 5+ accounts doing this at the same time, and thats how they make their AFK isk.

Now, with a bit of luck, I get the same in an evening in NullSec.

Maybe :

Frig sites payout are better than cruisers and they're a bit of fun multiboxing or with corp mates.

T2 consistent solo can be done in Retri, Hawk. Don't have figures on that though.
---
After Fleetwarp i want the fleet to land in a formation like in the trailers and not in a clusterfuck bubble.
---
Well you gotta kite with RHML. As a kiting platform it’s amazing since you just need to out-maneuver your opponents for the duration of the reload
---
Ships immune to local is an amazing idea tbh
---
I trained into caldari interceptors and used a crow to explore relic sites in Stain as they have the most valuable loot. A 2 hour loop around Stain would net me anywhere from 500M on a bad day to 900M on a good day. The trick was to extract it safely as the Stain exit through Catch is heavily camped to where even instawarping interceptors could get caught or smartbombed. I usually just waited for a good wormhole to empire space.
---
Yes. Why do we even give these advices to anyone anymore. " To play the game you have to afk" no. Fuck everyone suggesting afk ratting at all. Explore, Ninja Salvage, loot after fleet fights, trade, seed, run missions, scam nerds, FW Plex, Ninja clone soldiers....
---
Where do I sign up?
---
Multiboxing is perfectly legal. You can run as many omega clones as your computer/brain can handle at a time. But you can only ever have 1 alpha clone logged in at a time (no omegas alongside it either).
---
So basically you'd have to sub both accounts, which if you're doing something using both that can pay for that (example, c5 dualbox rattlesnakes or leshaks) then it's a non issue, but otherwise it's gonna be hard to pay with plex. You can offset the cost by brainfarming injectors your alt once you have the sp you want in the right places on it, which is how many pvpers who don't want to pve at all do it with dedicated interceptor or sabre alts etc.
---
You can also just recruit yourself. It's somewhat of a grey area tbh, with the only official CCP stance on it being "if you abuse the buddy program, you will be banned" leaving exactly what they mean by abuse very much up in the air. But I and many others have done it before with no issues. If you intend to use both the characters to play the game I can't see how they'd have an issue with it.

I write quite a lot about my political believes on Reddit, I've been advocating for a tax funded universal basic income all my life and have even been actively campaigning for it, alongside other things, against TTIP, for refugees etc. That one time we blocked Berlin's main airport for two hours in support of a couple refugees that where supposed to be detained was some of the best fun I ever had, it made the national news lel. Thanks for asking.
---
Carriers were meant to be ships that carried subcaps around, sat in a safe zone in a system and spit out ships for fleet members to reship into
---
Because 40+ man fleets of dictor immune near heavy combat capable ships is a little annoying when it becomes meta.
---
Based on how CCP's been really avoidant about their sources
---
They probably came as reward for clearing up Trig invasions
---
Actual turret points with rails/lasers/launchers that a defender could use. But the attackers can blow them up. Like defanging a POS tower

Thank you for all the great info.

I think they will drop in wrecks i noticed that trig invasion ship have loot implemented.

They are pretty sweet but they are mostly attached to slow ships, that's probably why. There are exceptions though
---
I completed few task for sansha nation and sold caldari tags i found in pirate wrecks.
---
Market trading of what variety? Station? Region? Full-on market manipulation?
---
then smallgang pvpers bitched and moaned about skynet being overpowered when it had literally been a thing since carriers were introduced and motherfuckers only started complaining in like 2014
---
and now we have the horrifically overpowered monsters that are carriers in the current year, so thank your friendly neighborhood smallganger for the carrier rebalance in citadel
---
Not an actual suggestion, more of historical interest.  
---
Running level 4 mission with a Raven in Aranir which is a 0.2 system (lowsec) in Derelik. It had I think 4x +10 Security agents (+10 denotes the quality where on a scale of -10 to +10, it has since been removed).  
---
It was back in 2005 so much less players and chance of getting caught. Didn't lose a single ship doing it. My cash out item at the time was Ammatar Navy Medium Nosferatu, it was before the Nos nerf so everyone wanted one.
---
Hey! New to Eve here (well, tried before, had to quit for lack of time, I'm now back!)
---
How can you destroy so many ships while barely taking any damage? Is it because they're T1 vs him with a huge T2 or something? 
---
Also you're never moving, I thought you always had to move when in fight to increase dodge chance, is it because the ship is to slow to move/turn so it's not worth bothering?
---
I have to go to work so I can't finish to watch the video, but I'm sure I have much to learn from it!
---
this is the only single change that makes a positive impact across the whole spectrum of play styles
---
When I first got into eve, I was told to look at all the T1 Frigates and choose to fly what I think is the coolest looking one.
---
Obviously, I thought the Merlin was AMAZING looking - and as someone who loves lazers, I made it my plan to fly a lazer Merlin.
---
Than someone in the new player channel explained ship bonuses and basically said "you can do w/e you want in Eve, but it's probably not the best idea."
---
T'was very sad...
---
Low sec incursions :dagger:
---
Started with station, quickly moved to regional as I discovered moving to other hubs was very profitable and many high volume items were often sold out or double priced outside of jita.  
---
Now I mostly speculate and manipulate based on my knowledge of certain markets regionally
---
Not true! ... I also want ISK. So that's 2 things.
---
I would increase the mineral requirement or super capitals x50.
---
u/srgrafo is a really awesome pepperoni
---
Exploration while training for Incursions. Check out Warp To Me, they run a type of highsec combat event known as an incursion. 40 people go in, blap things, and make good money.
---
Also one of the only ways to make money as a logistics pilot.
---
Salvaging took me to first billion combined with t1 / rig manufacturing. Carrier ratting &gt; super ratting &gt; titan ratting. Then I realized i'm space middle class, burned out and missed quite a lot of the game.
---
When I input the values I do have from my Cerberus fit ingame I get the following:
---
 r = (0.313 \* 17720000 \* v²) / (√(680² - v²) \* 1000000) 
---
`Use this to copy paste it directly: r=(0.313*17720000*v^2)/(\sqrt{\left(680^2\ -\ v^2\right)}*1000000)`
---
When I input this in [www.desmos.com/calculator](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) I get a nice graph which is exactly the one I hoped to see in Pyfa, but only with the axis reversed. The range for the velocity axis is always 0-Vmax.
---
However, it looks like the formula is no longer accurate. I deployed my MTU and started orbiting at various distances with and without afterburner and have to conclude the ship is a little more agile than suggested by the graph data.
---
Maybe the document linked by wjs018 will have the correct answer.
---
my experience with mmos so far (been around 20 years now, ac, daoc the likes) tells me that nostalgia is very subjective and it's usually about how you felt about yourself and the group you engaged with at that age and not about how the game objectively was (which usually was pretty bad).
---
2000-2012 was a great time for mmos
---
Simply untrue. A lot of the new player groups give end game content both PvP and PvE to new players the day they join.
---
This, sure a VNI will make you some isk bit the newbeans will get tired of the game fast and leave.
---
Lfg trig incursion, mastery 5 noctis.
---
Not too long ago this was "fixed" and the behavior was re-added since it was so widely used.  I forget what they were working on that changed it, maybe the reloading through gate jumps thing?
---
This is freaking adorable. Also I'm sure there's a group of people with similar conditions who are playing this game. If there's none, might wanna start one - I know some of the deaf players and they're some of the best dudes around :)
---
Imagine B-R going on...poor fuckers would be soo fucking raw!
---
do you wear this because your nips have deformed after being in abyssal space for so long?
---
Putting gifts behind stupid mining and BPC is worst, so I will take login rewards.
---
Damn boi. (Gurl lol)
---
Seriously, you can make a bil in a week just by joining a big alliance, participating in battles and looting and salvaging afterwards. Takes like 10 minutes to get 100 mil worth of loot and 100 mil worth of salvage compared to 4 hrs of vni ratting.
---
That's what happens when you drop a nuke in the sandbox and watch all the content fly out.
---
I dont really
---
Get why people think this would work. Bot owners would not give a shit that it takes a few more alts. They will just make some more alts and use them as scouts. This change will only work for like a week until the bots are adjusted.
---
Finally, a use for all my corpses.
---
Some of these questions will come up in other posts I have planned.
---
The last piece on plex raising 35% since Jan '19.
---
The PLEX sales have stopped. So much so that in the last "plex" sale in Mar '19 (need to check date) CCP simply cut the plex of omega from 500 to 475 plex. It was not a monetary cut in price (USD GBP EUR etc).
---
Remove faction ships from the FW LP store. You could still buy them from the navies (you can already do that today.) Removing them from the FW store means that most items in the FW could as well be bought from another faction. While the militias are still economically motivated to gain a high influence outside parties mostly lose the motivation to mess with FW influence.
---
Reset the game to 2003, and do it all over again.
---
Personal: return to the dominion sov system with single use SBU's.
---
Always said: Make large fights capable of happing with minimum or no tidi.
---
I like the idea in theory. But in reality we already multibox. This only means we would start to use more characters to control the Titan for example.
---
Because roaming in anything above a cruiser is a pain.
---
Why would you ninja if you can do it in a relaxing way?
---
Explo
---
One word - "latency"
---
It's a terrible experience and I would recommend not wasting your money or effort running games on AWS.
---
Intresting but powerfull.  
---
Make them imune to D-scan like recon ship and it will be an awsome tackle for whspace.
---
Haha yea that would be exactly the sort of mistake I’d assume CCP to make - then not declare it an exploit for 2years.
---
Lv5 data sites are sleeper caches. They have dangers that can blow up your ship. You need 104 scan strength to get em.
---
Resource scarcity
---
WTB Invite to Cobalt Edge Discord
---
Because ccp doesn't care about lore these days, this is literally incursions 2.0 within a week it'll be min maxed and it'll die like incursions
---
people always forget about wormholes when thinking about deleting local. If you come in through a wh with a dscan immune recon you cant be detected
---
They removed that from titans a few months ago for performance reasons. Probably not a good idea to add it to all ships. But it would make fleet formations interesting.
---
This. unfortunately
---
Feel free to hop in the in game channel “Abyssal Lurkers” or this Discord: https://discord.gg/cseYr85 for any kind of help you need with the abyss. The in game channel has a ton of fits saved and both the channel and discord have a lot of people that are experienced/knowledgeable that can answer any questions you have!
---
The invasion I would guess.
---
Nice )
---
Remowe plex.
---
same here.  
---
I was in a chill HS mining corp and find WH for relic/data from low trafic HS or LS.  
---
I got my first few bills like that. but honestly, I knew anything about WH (and no one in my corp coudl hep me), dscan, safespot, etc. I spend weeks exploring C4-6 wondering why I don't find any relic site
---
Bought it on eBay !!!
---
A decent way to categorize items/ships in our hangers using a directory structure. Maybe add the possibility to filter based on type while you're at it.
---
The fact that we have to use an ingame item that are a pain to move around and which adds limitations (like no repackaging) is unacceptable.
---
As a high-sec player: Incursions &amp; Abyssal sites
---
Can I do this solo or with a few alts ccplz?
---
I hate interactions with other human beings aside from shooting them, metaphorically
---
This is some good shit.
---
Darwinism - The biggest small alliance in Eve. Their MO is 'Shake the hornet's nest and see what happens' ..sadly, only butterflies occasionally show up to see what all the fuss is about :)
---
A decent way is to get to say a Caracal, and start doing abyssal deadspace. Learn what to do and when, what to target, etc. Then upgrade to a Gila as you progress, passive tank and start doing exotics or gamma sites at T3. From there, start looking at going to T4 sites. 
---
I made about 1.5 billion from doing abyssal sites over three days, going from Caracal to cheap passive Gila, to a bling gila doing T4s. 
---
A secondary option is to give wormhole combat site farming a go which can be lucrative as well.
---
I thought about it and this is actually a really neat change. Maybe not 100% faster, but...
---
It essentially makes the map smaller. People complain about EvE having too much empty space, and this is, well.. something. It's also an indirect nerf to cynos because they won't benefit from warp speed changes.
---
&gt;but include that they need to re-evaluate once they've figured out what they really like in Eve.
---
This falls apart when you include the concept of community building. Large blocs are not like eve-uni where it is expected for people to "graduate" and leave. They are built with the intention of keeping a player in the alliance/coalition.
---
They've been saying Logi on Killmails since 2012....Or earlier.
---
Not sure about you guys but in GSF we have a lot of situations where the FC calls to swap ammo while warping because he knows we're about to shoot i.e. mostly Basilisks and Phased Plasma is going to be useless.
---
At least we had, until Atrum killed Yachts :(
---
Nice.
---
I mean. I know you can activate the mwd after you went jump a wormhole. I’m sure if you’re quick enough. 🤷‍♂️
---
Just wait until the Triglavians invade Uedama/Niarja constellations, suicide gank anyone who attempts to run the Arc (or however you clear it) and we can have lovely triglavian gatecamps that kill freighters all day.
---
Roll back actual time and space to 10th March 2009.
---
Delet nulsec
---
Here is how i went from being space-okay(2bil networth) to space-rich(80bil networth), and am on my way to being super space rich(200b+)
---
**Space okay**
---
If you are in highsec, and making ISK is your goal, move to nullsec. 
---
If you move to nullsec Get a vexor navy issue and train those drone skills up.  Most of the  alliances I would think would sponsor a newbie his first VNI, along with some tackle ships to welp gloriously.
---
If you are in Gurista space or Blood raider space, run rally points and farm the escalations. When you get then, use a well tanked battleship and run the escalations yourself (Maybe a rattlesnake or Machariel). If you get lucky you will loot A type Invul fields (+- 1.6bil isk or A type EANMs +- 1bil isk) depending on the faction you are running. Save these up and start selling.. theres tons of other decent items that can drop from 6/10 escalations, but these two mods are your lottery mods. You can save isk up like this to move onto the next phase. 
---
Just doing rally points you will only be making around 40 mil per hour per VNI excluding the escalations.  With 2 accounts VNI ratting I would often get at least a A type drop per day. (maybe I was just lucky). But doing rally points honestly beats running havens or forsaken hubs because of the massive ISK injections you will get from the escalations. Just farming 6/10s quickly boosted me into being one of the capital ship cool-kids
---
**Space rich**
---
If you are in one of the big alliances  that have good capital umbrellas, you can now go with 1 of 2 options.  You can either get a carrier and work your way up to buying a supercarrier to  rat  with (this netted me about 270mil per hour before the nerf, dont know how much it is now) or rorqual mine. If you go with rorquals you will need to get extra accounts, I am running 3 rorquals, which nets me around 300mil per hour.  These however also let you mine moons which in some cases can give you crazy isk like 45 mil per minute if you are on an R64. 
---
You can now look at your regional market, go to eve-industry and enter your local ore prices and look for ships that are profitable to build. Make a few of those and start selling. 
---
The above equates for about 40% of my income.. the other things I won't be sharing since they are too profitable for little work.
---
To become super space rich you need to be looking at income streams that you do not need to be farming for. This means market stuff and any other possible passive income streams being fully optimized.
---
Got a second obvious spy character in an alliance that we were at war with and pretended to have acces to a few JF's. Was asked to move  a crap load of assets and ships etc.
---
So what you are saying is the import from Jita is what is causing the systemize scarcity to be useless as a conflict driver.
---
It works with heated MWD cycle on a double istab orca.
---
i'm a disappointment
---
If it's not a live event where the survival of GM ships actually matters to the outcome, then you're basically griefing an incursion. That's great and all, but it's is hardly going to impact the outcome of preplanned events. Think back to all those guardian galas and other pirate events. How much could have player effort actually made the scripted pirates *win*? Those are the unscalable walls to your sandbox right there. It ain't happening.
---
CCP added a warning similar to the one to lowsec.
---
I will try to post **more**
---
I expect the Nergal, Draugur and Ikitursa to follow the exact same process as the Rodiva -&gt; Zarmazd
---
This is so sad. Aura play Below the Asteroids.
---
Kugu is worse than helldump
---
This is a call out to code and other gankers. Stock up the ecm boats and stop the logi reps on those Bing fit ships running the sites!
---
Smae, boring as fuck, but consistent income
---
Or the first to post some bullshit RIP thing when a celebrity dies
---
True, but people will still probably die by suppressing it and forgetting about it. Also triglavian invasions having an impact on highsec shipping routes (and indirectly, nullsec logistics) is a very interesting.
---
Might be that one.
---
I remember seeing a graph which was more curvy, as a point in time report. Pretty sure it was public. one of those 'number of alts vs population percentage' graphs. Of course, I may be making that up.
---
allowing defenders to rep structures nullifies dumb fleet comps like boosh ravens whose entire strategy is to just remain out of reach for any hostiles while casually tossing cruise missiles from max range
---
forcing people to actually control the grid while grinding structures is important if you want structures to be a conflict driver, otherwise you just get boosh fleets ignoring hostiles and killing structures in spite of the defenders 
---
on the flip side, citadel bombs need to be defenderable. it's honestly inexcusable that they aren't
---
He is flying a Dreadnought, the 3rd biggest ship class in the game.
---
They cost 2-3 billion fully fitted and take months to train into. 
---
He isn't moving because to do good damage in one of those ships you activate Siege mode which increases damage and tank but stops you moving. 
---
Theres not much point moving anyway as you are such a big target you wouldnt be able to mitigate damage by moving.
---
Remove missions from factional warfare and redistribute the faucet between system capture and killing war targets
---
Thanks! I'll make sure to never cross one then!
---
Yep.  Especially since CCP seems to have designed the system to require trade due to the large distance between the areas where the different goos spawn.
---
Yep, Sansha incursion should have the same gatecamps. Especially that now even FOB's spawn gate rats.
---
I guess flexing over how much of a crab you are is normal in delve?
---
Don't forget that MTU has radius of 100. Maybe that's the reason it's slightly off.
---
I still do not understand what's the use-case? Normally i would want to have answer for one of following questions:
---
1) What orbit range do i have to set to have actual orbit range of x and higher?
---
2) What orbit range do i have to set to have actual orbit speed of x and higher?
---
3) What actual orbit range and actual orbit speed will i have if i set up orbit range at x?
---
This formula and graph do NOT answer them. It shows dependency between actual orbit range and actual orbit velocity. However, I do not know how useful is it when you have to pick requested orbit range manually to be in said orbit.
---
What I'd need to answer these questions are two graphs:
---
1) x - sum of requested orbit range, orbiting ship radius and orbited ship radius (center-to-center range between two bodies); y - actual orbit range
---
2) x - sum of requested orbit range, orbiting ship radius and orbited ship radius (c2c range); y - actual orbit velocity
---
They can be combined into one too, with two "y" axes - left actual range, right actual orbit, but it might be hard to read.
---
Not in Local when in gatecloak
---
I used daddys visa
---
They were when incursions came out, if I remember correctly. But were removed
---
I made a billion+ salvaging a couple of days after moving to Delve.  Made many billions running incursions
---
Except "Triglavian taking over HS" is just "there are rats in HS that are annoying" and that's about it. No mission, no LP store, nothing.
---
I agree my suggestion does nothing with the relation between which orbit distance you request and which distance is actually achieved.
---
My use-case for this graph is most of the time: can my ship with short range guns and high dps ammo still orbit the target with an mwd at my optimal range?
---
And I indeed forgot to check the radius of the MTU. That would indeed explain the discrepancy I noticed, making the formula correct after all.
---
i appreciate EVE design , but why are you make "windows" look like a typical 20th century building? in game it's just poor texture quality , but art..
---
What does stackless mean?
---
&gt;To accommodate the new Tech II Triglavian Ships being added, we're taking the opportunity to adjust Triglavian ship and module production with the Invasion expansion.
---
&gt;Brand new skills are introduced which are required for the invention and manufacture of Tech II Triglavian ships. New datacores, and new tech II components will also be made available that will be used for the invention and production of these Tech II Triglavian ships.
---
CCPlease dry my eyes, goddamn this hits right in the feels
---
Remove Rorquals.
---
This would start to address the super capital proliferation issue.
---
in before CODE. ganks all Triglavians in these systems after they opt to not by incursion permits.
---
Only in Hisec, Low and Nullsec still have Gate Rats from Incursions.
---
Oh ok thanks for the heads up didnt realize that.
---
Local inhibitor module: when anchored, prevents local from updating for X minutes.
---
Remove killmails.
---
Good fight, the most frustrating thing for me is always choosing to attack the BS's when you only have 2 or 3 more rounds of missiles in your turrets.
---
You could have killed a bunch of them if you reloaded before targetting them.
---
/u/ccp_fozzie if you add the warning to the Trig Incursion can we get the same one for Sansha and add the gate rats?
---
Get in a Heron or some exploration ship and do Relic Sites in null. This is the most noob friendly thing to do.
---
Also : Don't warp directly to gates. Warp to some planet or something first (use the solar system map for better orientation)
---
When you explore in null take some time to make boogmarks that are &gt;600km away from the gates (so you don't have to warp to a planet first). Always use DSCAN even when hacking relics, always check your surroundings.
---
Fly safe and have fun.
---
P.S. - I logged in yesterday for some exploration (need some liquid ISK fast) played 3 hours (while also looking at videos, reading and stuff like that) and made 400 mil
---
Alpha's being able to cloak is actually the worst suggestion in this thread, which is kind of fucking impressive.
---
if CCP gave a crap about highsec, James315 and his fuckbois would have been banned years ago.
---
But why they are content creators for higsec
---
Why the downvotes
---
The entire point of this event is to inflate login metrics, they don't really give a shit if you get your SP unfortunately.
---
I promise they won't even have the ability to 'take over a system' at all.  If left alone, I bet nothing happens, or at least not more than incursions.
---
Have you ever tried roaming through space? Nano-gangs and Hyperspatial fits are Highly popular nowadays, cruiser-and-down being the hulls of choice, due to necessity. Because fast warp speeds are essential to catching people. Null space blocks have Intel-networks, *(an alpha account in one system, can report the progress of reds along a jump route, all people have to do is get out of the way.)*
---
Add onto the fact that a null-sec roam can take hours, and span 100's of Jumps to find fights or a number of Kills worth un-docking for or taking that amount of time to roam for.
---
So doing something that increases the risk and loss of JF would be a welcome change to you? Perhaps say increasing the distance from stations and  upwell structures that a cyno can be lit?
---
What if I want to be the guy that makes love to sheep?
---
I never left jita 4-4
---
Highly unlikely
---
Would be nice to go into abyssal space and farm them to... Not like the 3 room stuff but 1 room with more fighting and if we win we loot and salvage the field!
---
Found the Welsh/Scottish player
---
Yep, they'll go one of two ways.  Either they'll be so weak nobody gives a shit about them and they're ignored, or they'll be too strong, people will not do them because they're strong, they'll fuck with shit and CCP will be forced to disable them or lose a bunch of carebear subs.  Since CCP literally only cares about that sub metric these days, they'll get rid of em fast. It's almost like they've done this before...\*cough drifters cough\*
---
This, but unironically.
---
Go get em tiger. Also i made my first billion running lv4 missions in hisec, 0/10 would not reccomend.
---
Shoot the poeple trying to push the triglavian out.
---
Have the devs play enough to sensibly implement features / be motivated to iterate on broken stuff.
---
If they drop in the invasion event only we've to expect a certain delay in actual production and line up of the ships, I hope in some added loot in standard sites too, if not, it doesn't appear resource wise to me, but we'll see I suppose...
---
Delete all logistics from the game. That way losses will be significant in all battles and game will be much more dynamic.
---
i gonna ignore triglavians... i will stay in my wormhole and look at the connections...
---
About 200plex should do it
---
fw:fw:fw:fw:
---
ship upkeep
---
Full server vipe. Start the universe from scratch :)
---
I'd resub for this.
---
He's lying and severely inflating his gains.
---
Another legend leaves and knots twist in my stomach for a game a barely play anymore. Like you I miss the old days, small gang PvP and piracy. The game moved on and I don't think I ever quite did, my playstyle lost with my boys in Veto to the seven winds. You were a solid pillar of the community man and you'll be missed.
---
didnt they sat the "scout"version would be semi soloable
---
You make it sounds like there aren't any exploration bots that could scan down the WH and park on it as if it was a gate.
---
Not that I'm against raising the bar for bots, I am against turning null-sec in to WH space while retaining cynos the way they are.
---
Not at all enamoured with the metallic look.
---
This looks like a Saudi Arabian prince who wanted his Audi to be covered with an all Silver body.
---
Buddy links and referral codes of any kind are banned on /r/eve
---
My mistake then, in my mind you needed lv 5 on the basic skill for faction. Alphas can't use T2 heavys already, soo that change would affect dps and the Gila mostly, that sadly dont fix the VNI as a viable boting ship...
---
yes you will, you are in horde, and especially the newbeans (bob bless their soles) jump on anything that moves. so im pretty sure youll be shooting/dying to one pretty soon. and eve loves you for that o7
---
Lmao C4 space
---
Is this the amount of time that now give to CCP before assuming the worst!?
---
Let's at least give it a try first, huh?
---
Remove injectors OR forbid multiboxing and see what happens to the meta.
---
NS exploration. Billions, billions everywhere..
---
Drifter incursions were a thing for about a week until Morathia and I (90% his work) broke them with Spectre Fleet
---
It's a Python mutation. Google it.
---
Msg sent!
---
I'm definitely more than willing to see what they have planned once it is released, however, the past few updates have been pretty lackluster with the exception of Abyss stuff, so I'm not particularly optimistic.
---
Whatever the fit, try it on the test server and run at 3-5 sites before going into abyss on tq.
---
Working as a pusher for the Hedonistic Imperative back in ‘09, hauling drugs through nullsec in a Buzzard to fulfil an order for someone I don’t remember. I thought it was Goonswarm, but they didn’t hold sov then. But I did once deliver drugs to them. They gave me docking access to one of their outposts. Must have made 2-3bn profit off that deal. And, after fulfilling it, they podded me back to highsec on the undock.
---
Ninja looting, can baiting, explo.
---
Hey buddy i have sent you a message, if you are coming back to the game you'll need a good group of folks to play with and you are in luck, [Dreddit is Recruiting!](https://dredditisrecruiting.com)
---
I hope Invasions will be a constant thing and not just a brief event like the drifter one was.
---
If you're looking to farm while living in a c4 you either want a c3 or c5 static so you can farm through there. C4 sites aren't great for farming and due to the fact anoms don't respawn in the same way they do in null you'll often have no anoms in your home system at all
---
Probably, but IIRC regarding incursions, LS is Russian-dominated, and NS is just whatever coalition is there, don't use gates in a super and all that. HS gatecamps would be nice tho
---
CCP's citadel shitfest, jammer changes, and push for Abyssmal content doesn't drive conflict though, it does the exact opposite.  Players are partially to blame, but CCP's lack of giving a shit and terrible, poorly thought out changes are a large part of what has driven the game to this.
---
Change injectors to boosters that players can make while still costing plex for some components. So that while 'injecting' is still an option for that corporate greed, it doesn't break the game like it does today.
---
Whops, didn't read the rules first.
---
Mea Culpa.
---
Got the link in msg, thanks all.
---
you can turn 100 mil into 1 bil in a month by station trading, just sit in jita 4, log in once a day, buy stuff that's always in demand (missile launchers, nano membranes, certain factions stuff) that also have at least 10% difference between buy/sell, sell them, profit.
---
You can also do predictive trading by buying on the down cycle and selling on up-cycle.
---
To get your first funds, mine in a venture into salvaging and maybe ratting
---
I've never tried it but I'd guess dreads won't work well due to the garbage spawns, I know carriers work but probably use T1 fighters since you will lose a few. C4 sites have lower isk/ehp on average than c3 C5 and c6, the total payout is fairly low so you will get through sites quickly, the wave distances are very high making the sites slower and the spawn rate is low since no one runs them. It's not to say don't do them just if you want to optimize ratting you should probably look to a farmhole (C5/6 if you want to use caps) or your static in subs.
---
A better callout would be for some apoc smartbombers. I've heard of people slipping five of them into a TCRC and blowing up blingy incursion fleets that way.
---
Don't forget that it'll be like the battle of caldari prime where they push a narrative that the players can decide the outcome and then undock 50 dreads in hisec to melt the fucker
---
Can confirm local's dead, I can't see people who are in the same system as I am
---
Was trying to message a new player a fit to train for so he could join our fleet and.... mail system is dead too.
---
Good things always happen in the wrong time zone =(
---
This guy hasnt been ram ceptored yet
---
In all other games I play I reach a point where there's no more challenge, while in eve I find I can continue to skill myself, even after more than 3 years playing now
---
That is good too so long as you have the guys ready at the time.
---
In terms of more it would imply you couldn't use any chat. Cf FTY Eve novel.
---
Truly a HUGE mistake! ;)
---
Maybe have a sixth account in fleet perhaps? Sacrifice one noob hyperion for the comms...
---
I like you.
---
Oh pardon, late night blunders. TBH T3Cs aren't nearly as oppressive as they used to be, and I actually really like the new rig system. The loki needs a loooong look at it, but the rest are kind of eh
---
&gt; That all sounds nice and good, except in WWB there were wealthy GSF  corps that ran partial-SRP programs and completely ran out of isk after  only a few machariel fleet welps. And pressing your linemembers for SRP  money WILL fuck you. There's a *reason* nobody does it anymore. 
---
Then these Condi corps weren't wealthy ;-) imagine you have a corp that has only 10 members ( which is basically nothing )
---
each of these members does 2 hours of super ratting each day and earns 600 million with it. ( which is not that much ).
---
the corp these guys are in has the common tax rate of 10% and earns 600 Million Tax money per day. 
---
after only 1 year this small corp, doing only a bit of ratting, earned 219B isk or 4 fully fit titans. 
---
well, even mid sized alliances are home for hundreds of members ratting, many have renters and sell moonore etc. 
---
if you think that a battle like x47 where 50 or even 100 titans die matters isk wise, you really have no idea what you talk about. 
---
&gt; You're asserting that everyone in a leadership role in that war were  slobbering retards. That Elo Knight, Doomchinchilla, Vince Draken,  whoever lead SkillU, and whoever lead CENTI were all fucking retarded  and had no idea how citadel mechanics work. Given how I've never heard  of you before, I'm inclined to think you're the moron instead. 
---
theoretical and practical knowledge are very different things. 
---
most of the CONDI FCs aren't slobbering retards. But they still decided to deploy 600 dreads to hakonen ( and failed hart. They decided to attack the9-4 keepstar with fighters only and failed
---
I feel you on the multibboxing stuff. I have always played on 1 char and 1 account, and I have seen a great number of 4 account players burn out.
---
Pffff those rules
---
remove the turret and launcher bonuses from the soct ships and replace them with better scan and hacking bonuses
---
Damn, why do i alwys have to be at work, while everyone is having a blast. :(
---
I will keep it simple. Mission agents move around to emulate players effect on space. So systems near systems with a lot of pirate/enemy empire mission activity get security missions, systems farther back give missions to move ammo and shit for them and then you have the industry mission shipping shit to those guys (or close enough).
---
After a period System near baddies moves to a random near by system weighted based off how many missions were done. So if a ton of people did security missions its going to move into where it had been sending people on security missions, or it could fall back if tons of pirate agents did missions.
---
Then everyone else also shifts around.
---
... oh and then make it so WHO gives missions out changes based off FW. So suddenly my Caladari station is owned by a Gal company etc.
---
Maybe also have it so missions use that point pool ship spwaning? Basically each mission has a set pool to start with and each wave also has a pool. So you never know what you will run into exactly and each wave will be different based off what your flying (up to the point pool it has)
---
Basically mission overhauls.
---
What are the mechanics on SISI so far? Are the sites themselves already there? Is it similar to Sansha incursions? I'm a bit lazy so I don't want to check it out myself.
---
they'd only go off like once every 10 minutes
---
With CCReeee's wonderful new chat system, even that difference is questionable.
---
Made a lot of ISK in a short time. Good times blapping them in trashers.
---
When i will be back home i will start to prep for ECM bursting logistic ships.       
---
Unless you know ... CCP will decide to do it a "instanced PVE" and go against the whole "sandbox" of EVE.
---
Remove multiboxing.
---
Lol, cepters are already retardedly good, its not too long ago the game was literally ceptors online.  They had to nerf half of them into uselessness to fix that.
---
God it was so funny. Meta guns and shit were running out across eve, we used them all up.
---
I like that.
---
roll, roll, roll your hole
---
You're setting yourself up for some heavy losses. If you REALLY must do c4 sites, you're probably better off slapping your chars in RR domis.
---
This is just absurdly good.
---
No way are you not a professional artist.
---
You could hang this at CCP HQ and nobody would doubt one of their resident artist had made this.

Wait, wut? Eve has sound?
---
Bought up heaps and heaps of drone parts for some manufacturing phase I was going through. Got bored of the manufacturing in like 2 days and forgot about the parts. A few months later they announced the rorqual changes and my useless parts suddenly became worth 15-20 mil each. Ahhh, good times.
---
Aight, so firstly, the Taranis is just as "useless" now as it was before nullification. Which is to say that it's a beast of a frigate in the right hands. And secondly, fuck em, remove all the gun and missile hardpoints from the fleet ceptors. I already fit a full rack of NOSes on my malediction.Just give me something that can out-run a bot.
---
&gt; No? I am saying when we take small gangs into nearby space, people dock up or drop supers.
---
Take a non-test alt and you quickly realize you guys do exactly the same thing, why should other folks give you content when your alliance has been doing content denial for the last 2 years.
---
Turn the servers off.
---
haha the rivers of krab tears!
---
&gt; did a HUGE mistake and created my first toon as a woman
---
why is that a problem
---
do you want to stare at a dude for hours each day?
---
I dont usually do this, but heres my upvote.
---
Yeh, if you see one call for help and get it tackled. 
---
If you dont have help though theres not much point engaging.
---
wormhole exploration in my trusty Magnate :) I would simply find an empty system in high sec, scan, jump into the hole, do the exploration thing and warp back out. I really loved the thrill of it and highly recommend everyone to try it. especially in the beginning. of course I got killed in wspace but I had some good conversations with the guys that got me and one even payed for my ship with a little extra on top. good times
---
Well basically, because even if you yell into the microphone, they are still not leaving comms. Probably the best listeners. :)
---
I was so happy to see that new Thukker skin for the Cyclone. It looks almost like the old Sleipnir, and boy, do I miss the old Sleip model :'(
---
ur opinion is wrong
---
It also takes at least one extra tick to enter warp, so you are still slightly more vulnerable than you would be if you successfully hit heat + cloak + mwd in the same tick, but it is true that it does make it easier to execute if you aren't confident.
---
cool. lets pretend they put that effort in every bot system (this means botters must run multiple programs, also alphas cant cloak so they would have to pay for omega scouts. Lets just pretend they all do that, they still would not be able to defend against any dscan immune recons that were previously logged of and are just logging on in safe spots.
---
for the love of god dont tell ppl you have caps in a c4 cause you gonna be asking for an eviction
---
the best way to farm in a C4 is to have C5 static.
---
In WH,, isk don't come from your hole but from your static (except for bear hole)
---
skynet was overpowered as fuck lmao, just because ccp found a way to make it worse doesn't mean it didn't need to be fixed
---
NPC combat timer prevents tethering
---
It has happened before ... it will happen again!
---
You don't need to be in fleet.  What you do is open up your scanner and right-click bookmark all the anoms (well, the Sanctum and Haven, maybe Forsaken Hubs).  The anoms will disappear from the scanner when the site is done but you still have the bookmark for the loot.
---
I would warp to it about 5 minutes after it's disappeared from the scanner, which is a fairly polite amount of time.  If the super is still there, gtfo.  If there's an MTU down already, gtfo.
---
That's all there is to it.  Sometimes the super pilot will leave a faction drop behind, not realising he'd just killed one.  And be careful, sometimes he'll leave a wave behind so don't go warping there in your noctis.  Just warp, drop MTU, bookmark MTU, go to next.
---
nah it won't, it's an expansion not an event, there's no "end" to it, it'll just become another abandoned thing like incursions
---
Can confirm lmao
---
CCPlease change core game mechanics so I can safely grief HS players.
---
A Rattlesnake will clean all the sites in a c3 easy.
---
Reset
---
&gt; instead of farming those.
---
But isn't EVE a Farms&amp;Fields game right now, with the ones farming hardest winning the game ?
---
True. Instead of collaborating, alliances would require alts. Just like having a FAX-alt ready to undock when rorq mining.
---
Cuz dreddit lost on it's own ground and wants to flee
---
NOOOOOOOOO ... i wanna leave work ... so unfair ... never happens when i am at home :((((
---
Please CCP could you leave it like it is for ... lets say 10 more hours? Thanks :)
---
Solving it in a fun way may not really be a reachable goal, but they've done nothing but make it worse.  That's kind of impressive in its own, sad way.
---
Enjin integration.
---
The 1 main and 2 sp farm being negative 1-1.5b doesn't mean he is loosing that. 
---
Since stopping with the mctc's and plexing the account just for the main would cost 2-2.4b
---
Yes it wasn't filling up the wallet anymore. But draining it slower. And still is. 
---
If you end up wanting to use plex to play, it's still cheaper to also farm the other 2 characters.
---
I dont know, i would like to use a cloaking device
---
first race war?
---
I few with a guy for a while who was a double amputee (leg) and had a paralyzed arm from a car crash... There are a lot of people who have real life disabilities in eve, but eve is a game where your mind matters more than anything.
---
It looks like my wife's hair straighteners. Is this the hairdresser clade of thebTrig?
---
So fight for the hole?
---
Don't worry bud! Knowing CCP and their chat system fixes you will have plenty of opportunities in the future.
---
The cap escalation wave serves as a bottleneck preventing you from near instantly clearing every site with dreads/caps. It's still great ISK/hr but you can only bring dreads into the site. 3 Naglfars (+ a rorqual if you want to make life easier) is the optimal setup, clearing all sites in 2 cycles.
---
PVP is so deep in Eve that the players are trying to metagame the devs and wreck their Trig event.
---
I love it.
---
IT WAS FIT WITH THE FOLLOWING
---
16" BRRRRT
---
Imagine Iowa class going broadside BRRRRT
---
Increase corp bookmarks
---
*tinfoil*
---
CCP overpowered Trig ships so people would have the farm the new incursion to get them thus making their new PvE content a massive success in the data.
---
Either that or they wanted to limit production to enable small gangs to have the Trig ships almost exclusively but forgot about how we regularly break the game and how the economy massively favours the big null entities...
---
Lowsec Clone Soldier cruisers in belts drop tags worth 15-35mil are what I use to do as a new player alongside scanning down and running the DED sites.
---
I did it in non-fw lowsec and pretty much lives in a whole region by myself, except the occasional super traveling through to where ever they were going.
---
Combat exploration in high sec can make billions and can be done in a destroyer just fine, you just can't do all sites.
---
&gt;Once built it seems as though the caps will be enough to defend the wormhole
---
😂
---
Ty for the kind words 
---
I'm always up for suggestions, but I'm only doing this kind of stuff when I end up totally bored, which is very rare. I got two jobs and CGI/concept art is none of them. It's just a hobby.
---
Theoretically it's faster than base python at massive amounts of concurrent sequential operations. Meaning it works well for Eve. 
---
Still, C++ is still 14-20 times faster than stackless...while blowing away normal python by a factor of 200.
---
CCP is one of the only corporate entities today to rely on Stackless Python for their core product.
---
How would they look in the future? I mean it's probably a square or round shaped glass. What do you mean?
---
Well... time to dock up my ratting ship.
---
Bring a doll to Vegas and I’ll point to the spot... ;-)
---
James is brilliant.
---
&gt;Because at that time, believe it or not, E1 was actually not very well-known at all.
---
This isn't true. He was a well known figure in the crime and pun section of the forums, often gave good advice to newbies (inc me) and also on the market forums. Now what he was doing WASN'T nice, but several GMS have already ok'd it.
---
 If CCP wanted the bonus room to stop all they had to do was say stop it. Thats it. The ex post facto justice was wrong, I said it at the time and I believe it today. Its one of the big reasons why I quit EVE as I lost trust in CCP.  I get that you didnt like that element of the game, except its still there. CCP could shut it down if they wanted. They could have shut it down long ago. They don't, they just say "enjoy your content" to the griefers. So the whole "bad men enjoying hurting others" isn't an argument that can wash (even if it should). 
---
 I never ever heard you say why they couldnt have just told E1 to pack it in. Like any reasonable person would have. warn them. ESPECIALLY when you prev ok'k what they were doing.
---
First of all ... don't have caps in C4 space. I mean, ofc do what you want in EVE, but then at least don't write about it :D especially when you use a number that's higher then 1 ... once someone figured out how to bait you, to summon your caps, they will be dead.
---
But coming to the making money part. C4 can bring up a good income ... don't listen to "omg makes no money" stuff. Sites can be learned the same way, like in C5 or C6 space, so you can adjust to spawn points and such and also effects.
---
Not saying you have to have multiple toons (one rattlesnake can do it), dualboxing is the preferred way ... i was using even 3 toons. 2x Cruise Missile Raven + capstable self rep AB-scimatar. Total cost for all of them is something around 1,1-1,2B ISK. But with some training, and the appropriate skill you can easily put out 2.000+ DPS on a very long range and can clear sites pretty effective (Black Hole is really awesome for that :D )
---
it will be from daily log in rewards
---
I mean as in CCPs control over how it progresses - we likely wont be able to allow them to take over some space because The Empires will just send their own fleets out in the background and round them all up
---
well, you actually made me rethink my decision.
---
Resculpt could be easier overall.
---
reward owning space, but make the methods of owning it easy to lose and quick to regain.
---
Turning owning space into a bigger pain in the butt, while small groups will inevitably be smashed but bounce back when the invader leaves
---
The removal of anything that allows input broadcasting.
---
You are exactly right. I should have been more specific. The decision process had to change. As you said do I carry on but lose less. Do I stop one character. Do I stop the whole account.
---
The 6-12 months prior the "average player" was happy chugging along because "just extract 2 slots and pay for the account" had changed. The followers if you like were doing it because everyone else was doing it.
---
C4. Single rattlesnake (2b fit) can easily do 200m/hr.
---
Got back to the game from a few months break.If I read correctly the only nerfs the Titans got were some tracking ones to the HAW guns.Is there anything else?
---
just get sunglasses and a cool jacket and its good
---
Same... But they are still a loooong way from even a playable beta
---
I think it depends on what kind of pve you want to do. If you want to farm low tier abyssals you can use a kitey caracal it can clear t3s (it's hard though) for ded farming you should propably go for a rattle or gila (not exactly caldari I know), but you will need drone skills. Alternatively just use a raven, it's much cheaper and easier to train in than a rattle. But as I said I don't know what you want to do just throwing in a few suggestions.
---
I think people that don't farm are true winners here.
---
Deathspider
---
No that's pretty much it. But it was a nerf and Brisc and some associates sold their titans before it.
---
It is more about eve being a sandbox and players should have ability to act as they choose with adequate repercussions for the sandbox.
---
Peer in to the flames, tell me what you see?
---
Not in null, people will basically give you the sites. 
---
I personally hate when wreck i killed go to waste (i do not salvage myself) and from what i have seen, most ratters in null don't.

Kestrel -&gt; Caracal -&gt; Drake are good bets, quick bit of googling should give you fits for what you want to use them for.
---
You can join our alliance. Muderous mindset 
---
We are not huge and  we hold sov  not mutch but we are doing our best
---
Bought stuff on contracts for cheap, hauled it back to Jita and sold it for parts.
---
you can make way cheaper than 2b
---
It really does depend on what PVE stuff you're actually tackling, I really enjoy using the Cerberus and Jackdaw for anoms and Tengu for missions.
---
Try nullsec, besides the better ores, if you have jf pilots in corp who do jita trips, importing faction items and ships bpcs will allow you to make VERY good isk supplying the local market. As with stuff like gilas and garmurs the rorquals are not directly competing with you. It also helps that the margins are good, high value items. So it means that to produce these goods the time required mining is actually pretty low, and you can get 30 - 40 % margins easy.
---
I recommend getting one or two of each faction frigate and start there, increase the volume for items that sell frequently and branch out to cruisers once you have some isk.
---
Good luck!
---
Personally, if you guys escort the Triglavian Collective and help them take a chunk of high sec, everyone who's got clones in those areas + everyone who helped "escort" them, all those players get their clone contracts permanently revoked (i.e. permadeath).
---
Because THE EMPIRES are paying to maintain the facilities for your clone renewals.
---
He is ”famous” for getting a few good players banned. We will always remember our perma banned heroes!
---
EVE gate is just lost DAoT tech.
---
Sadly some of the older kids have a surplus of big toys and are mixing their sand with concrete.  
---
Meanwhile the guys responsible for maintenance are hesitant to add things that could shake up the sandbox, because someone might get hurt.
---
Caldari hub is jita 4 moon 4 cn assembly plant. Its also a top spot for scamming griefing and suspect bating so prepare to be pawned if you spend all your time there.
---
 Welcome to eve btw
---
The initiative if you can pass
---
In null, so long as a supercarrier ratter trusts you, they'll happily let you follow them, salvaging and looting up all the wrecks.
---
ok
---
Remove microtransactions and leave only the monthly sub,
---
Comrade its trash, let it die it's the most humane way.
---
Xup.
---
I would prefer to give them an electric shock every time a Rorqual activates PANIC
---
Did you mean deleting local or putting a short delay on it? My idea is to have the delay short enough that the botters don't bother to change, because it only helps if you are within dscan range. It should be long enough to load the screen properly though. If you meant deleting local, i think it is a terrible idea too.
---
Someone can't seem to find enough afk ratters lol.

Elixir is the trendy hotness right now and it’s powered by Erlang.

fruitless. with so much technical and mechanical debt, one change does nothing
---
Does farming my bank account &amp; CC count?
---
use a c3 or c5 static. isk/ehp in c4 sites is terrible. also relying on your home hole for sites is kinda dumb. no guarantees of good site respawns.
---
My clones are maintained by Sansha Nation or by me on my Citadels.
---
I mean, they already don't, but ok. At least, boosts don't work on Excavators, and I'm certain that this was your complaint.
---
Oh wow, so I sit in my gunners seat and press F1. That is stupid.
---
I mean that pretty much sounds like what is happening now. (The incomplete feature part)  
---
You also have to add i think they mentioned there was going to be no more feature for another year or 2 while they finished WiS
---
you're genuinely fucking stupid

Then pony up the 15 bucks a month.
---
No this is called  P2W }:&gt;        
---
On serious note.      
---
You don't have to farm, there are plenty activities that provide good enough income ... especially if you play eve to have fun
---
Delete all subcaps
---
Nope buy extractors. For the possible big extraction of free SP.
---
Then take your profits and buy the dip on injectors.
---
Meh.  Bring on the skin pants.
---
Make WH local like everywhere else.
---
Remove subcaps instead

Just to be clear, the people down voting you are fucking scum
---
Well, doing some burner farming every 2nd weekend for about 2hrs gives me enough money to buy Doctrines and Caps. Usually I double my farmed ISK wit CC then to progress a bit in savings for Titan. 
---
I know I could just join Goons with Hel-Alt and farm my ass off, but that is just awful gameplay to me and would make me quit EVE because of carpal tunnel syndrome ...
---
wstabs :)
---
Some people love to do it in RL but some people love to do it in EvE instead.
---
I'd love to see this as well!
---
That's not really how Eve works. You want a PvE ship, it's going to die if you get caught no matter what. You can't be prepared for it. Just use what ever ship is the most optimize to run what ever combat thing you're doing.
---
Huh. 
---
That pain job.

Huh.

Falling asleep at 2nd site here while ratting.

You can kinda do that.  [https://zkillboard.com/region/11000030/](https://zkillboard.com/region/11000030/)   Is for a lot of C6, for example
---
i've had some succes farming in a damage bonused c4 with a carrier before carrier changes, it was actually really good isk.
---
Besides that i would advice to skip c4 to farm c5 or c3.
---
Idk why not just take some space there and stop looking for handouts.
---
Removal of all capital class ships.
---

I did passive myrmidon too, similar to my jinx twin here.

Pretty sad if true. EVE 2019.

Exploration, get a heron, look up how to scan and do wormhole relic sites, i tried to roll a day 0 char and i went to stain, a bit difficult to get there as a newbie, once i got there i got enough loot for 200mill, if i had gotten greedy i could have gone through the rest of the region and gotten 1 bill in 1 day.
---
Not really surprising, Goons had 600 titans last time they went north, today that numbers is probably around 800, 1000 on a hyper ping
---
PANFAM can form 500 on a very good day, its not even worth fighting for. Its a 50k coalition, with its 40k allies vs a 25k coalition, what did you expect.

and here i was, thinking that the "stain" part of your nick refered to the region
---
more tank and more ewar (and specific ewar), the lachesis could be somehow eclipsed

isnt this counterproductive? the imperium wants to burn down a region if they unanchor the expensive structures, then wont the imperium go to another region and burn it down, thus effectively burning 2 regions

It’s clearly long over for you if you think rorquals have any relevance within NCPL.

Goons - time to go to war 
---
Pan fam - oh shit
---
How many of those Tataras had juicy rigs on them I wonder?
---
that was the 40k allies i mentioned
---
No surprise to have, Goons are stronger than NC/PL especially without GotG and Goons can basically destroy all of that if they want to suffer through the grind. I don't think Goonswarm has any interest in invading the region, they have nobody to place there and just want to trash NCPL sand castle.
---
NC PL is taking the smart decision (because LOL at them fighting a grinding war against Goons) and Goon are getting some prestige by being able to scare another power house in the game.
---
Good for them, I don’t know who recommended unanchoring keepstars instead of anchoring them, but that guy is smart.
---
What is that face about? half the people on youtube has that as their profile pic.
---
Outdated? Horde have never been over 20k, its still one of the fastest growing alliances in EVE
---
Outdated info isn't the same as retarded statements
---
Good guy OP doesn't crop out the artist and then links their post.
---
It's just a random picture of [JC Denton](https://deusex.fandom.com/wiki/JC_Denton), protagonist of Deus Ex. He says that line while talking to some random nutbar conspiracy theorist on the street.
---
This idea does not work once you leave the realm of helictopter dicking with caps. There are real use case problems with the idea of a cyno spool up on any scale beyond a save or small gang getting blobbed.
---
You must be the light of all the parties, eh?
---
CCP doesn't 'progress' things. They release an expansion then NEVER touch it again. Incursions/missions/wormholes/anoms/etc have never been reiterated upon.
---
That bean art might just be cooler than our bee art. GJ  to whoever made it!
---
yes.
---
Ah, wonder why everyone makes that their profile pic.. been wondering for months.
---
But yeah, I meant my memory still in the "almost 20k and growing"
---
Maybe if they'd stop shitting on their renters and friends they'd have more?
---
Why wouldn't we?
---
Until some guy warp in 25 sentry rattles with a loki trigger.
---
can see that, definitely would have without purges. But then again, numbers wouldn't mean much if half the alliance is afk
---
Nothing in history has been more deserving of the phrase 'pray for the best, expect the worst' than CCP releasing new features. I WANT the stuff they come up with to be great new emergant gameplay opportunities. It never is.
---
MFW they chase goons out of dek, then leave them be for 3 years - and are surprised they built 1000 titans
---
Don't let ur dreams be memes
---
Aye

I think you are forgetting about Test Dreads that will drop on NC trying to fight back using big toys.
---
What about 4K FRT bots?
---
i mean not based on the footage I've seen with my site runner in Tenal. Hedliner's on? Siege green!
---
The last time people worked out how to do mass multiplayer content solo CCP banned input broadcasting. Good chance they don't want you running MP stuff solo.
---
Had to be all of them as they're useless without rigs.
---
CFC Is still stuck in 93PI, you don't want to go there dude!!!
---
Unless NC outplayed all and din't put rigs knowing that **Goons will come, they have to come**
---
Sure we can count winter co on panfams side, but then we would have to add gotg on goons side
---
Everyone shits on GOTG, at least they tried to stand and fight for a while (no matter how poorly) instead of running before we even got there. 
---
This is just sad
---
&gt; Unless NC outplayed all and din't put rigs knowing that **Goons will come, they have to come**
---
totally agree ... its the eve community that keeps me going on ...
---
Ain't no empire paying to upkeep my keepstar.
---
Think about 100bil tataras, and not less costly sotiyos.        
---
Rigs are pretty expensive, some structures also.
---
&lt;3
---
Isk positive before we even invade!
---
What makes you think they are surprised ?
---
&gt; (Did I get that right?)
---
Yeah pretty much spot on.
---
The training at the start really sucks. EVE got way more interesting for me once I passed the 20m SP mark, I was just keen enough that I started a 2nd and 3rd account within 3 months of playing, then a 4th and 5th about 6 months in. Thing is once I was at 20-30m SP, one of those alts could just barely fly a carrier, another could just barely fly a dread, and another could fly a JF that I used to make ISK, there was piles of stuff I could do. I hardly even used that carrier pilot for anything but personal logistics until a year later when it could fly triage, and the dread pilot got sporadic use.
---
What the deal was though, is that there was masses of other people with 20-50m SP ready to fly subs. I spent most of that time in BL and it was largely what you see BL/Origin up to today, there was just a lot more people to fight.
---
Honestly the real grind imo was that first maybe 3-6 months of training where you're basically just getting fitting skills, basic tank skills and t1 guns. If the game actually started there I'd have a lot less sympathy for the injector argument.
---
&gt;. Its a 50k coalition, with its 40k allies vs a 25k coalition, what did you expect. 
---
Remember 3 years ago when we got kicked out of the North by a coalition of the whole of eve and the numbers were massively imbalanced like this and we were basically told to HTFU
---

because farming someone right after a war is soooo much fun
---
well, i'm bad at Future and spaceship design , meanwhile i do have an engineering degree , - so i've just picked up most reasonable science "feeling" of future , -there is no need in windows in spaceships now for many many many reasons (iss is an exception), and even less need in future . Having very precise cameras and high quality displays\\projectors you could project image anywhere with any additional filter\\edit\\manipulation.  And glass is very ancient\\inflexible\\fragile material, and any other opaque polymer is even worse - can't absorb radiation, has different physical temperature\\pressure windows, weakening the structure of a hull just because there is a hole in it for the "window" . Hell , just accidentally being in a room for a second with unprotected eye and unprotected ""window"" while side turned towards the star makes you blind in less than a second.
---
i would say , the most stupid thing in space ship is a fking window.  Okay, maybe few round , protected  etc. for emergency is okay , but totally not the whole hull looking like a penthouse
---
Just re-released Dust 514 exactly how it was, on PC.

You lot make it sound like you want a more dangerous EvE..hey I am in, where do I sign up?

How many siege modules do you estimate were green, between PL and NC ? Genuine question.
---
Get Ventures out of FW plexes. 
---
Seriously, warp core stabs are excluded, why aren't ships with built in stabs?
---
can we give them Provi?
---
Thought PL was supposed to be the top of the elite PvP food chain.
---
good day to uninstall eve
---
Am i complaining?
---
Yeah, you can assume any EC or Refinery had rigs on it, as the whole fucking point of dropping those is/was to rig them for their bonuses. In the case of the Sotiyos, 30-40b per rig, minimum, for T1. Now, some poors just put the T1 ship rig on to build titans and then build their comps in a Raitaru off the undock rather than spend 30-40b on a second rig for the comps in the Sotiyo and it would fit the M.O. of PL/NC to build titans in this manner. Fort rigs are about 3-5b isk each, T2. Keepstar rigs are 30-40b isk each, T1. Tatara rigs are a 3-4b isk each, t1, and 15-20b for the t2 reaction rig and 60-90b for the t2 reproc rig (depending on volatile t2 salvage prices that week).

If you need to buy extractors for plex, and plex price is at an all time high, why would extractors be cheaper now than when plex was cheaper?

Follow up economic damage. How many supers or titans are in build in that sotiyo that won't complete? Probably just renter builds anyway.
---
Old Caldari cruiser hull designs were better, change my mind
---
They should really rebalance the prices to make rigs cheapear but the structures way more expensive. 
---
Maybe structure Spam might be mitigated a bit if that was the case.

So you're saying you don't pay for your keepstar upkeep... interesting... care to give us a location for this keepstar? :P

I started mining and building stuff for profit but I soon found that simply buying minerals and building was better. I did this for like 2-4 weeks and made a billion. I still do industry and I make more isk per batch but I don't put as much time in it now.
---
It’s an incredibly smart move if true, the north can’t win, in the long term! against the south. So you use scorched earth tactics, if they invade take down every station, retreat from ever engagement don’t engage them! Frustrate them at ever level. And yes a lot of people are going to get extremely frustrated, on both sides! but the enemy will start to not turn up to fights and slowly but surely loose moral till the point they go home, then the north can just undock and retake the region, It’s a legitimate tactic. The north CANT complete with the south’s numbers.
---
Counterpoint: Its probably one of the few Sotiyos that are un-anchoring because it didn't have any in build in it. I have no direct knowledge, but my assumption is there are a few Sotiyos not un-anchoring yet BECAUSE there is shit in build in them.

It's true, and easy to forget. But once in a while you have a conversation with a corpmate over comms and you forget they're on a different continent. You laugh, you share, you support, you vent, and you play spaceships. Eve is many things to many people, but most often it's a bizarre little community.
---
Okay why are you sucking up to INIT? Are you trying to make a play in trying to join? Are you tired of being a single lady in the greater EVE Cluster?
---
From what i've seen on hoboleaks there are different sizes of "conduits" ( sites equal to vg,as,HQ?) and a final "World arc" site. Rats seem to be the same as in abyssal space.
---
I am gonna huff, I am gonna puff and....hey where did everybody go to? Fuck me they even took their houses with them!
---
I'd avoid any Kspace for ISK making.  Find yourself a newbro friendly WH corp like EVE Uni or others.  Get on some gassing, group or solo ratting, explo/hacking that way you have a different variety of activities and not "orbit rock at 20", it will slowly eat at your soul.
---
I remember when goons lost this space in WWB, how they stood their ground and fought for year... oh wait didn't they run to lowsec?
---
I kept re-reading the pic thinking I was dumb, then I gave up trying to make sense of myself and scrolled down; turns out, I am dumb.
---
In 2-3 days time people with Omega will start having 1,000,000 SP on their accounts. Now not all but some will decide they might want to extract it. So, buy the extractors now, sell them in 2-3 days time when they are in demand. Nothing to do with PLEX on this one just a trade.
---
Now what will happen?
---
People could have lots of Injectors to sell, pushing the price down. Buy them. wait for the supply/demand imbalance to correct higher. And sell them. Profit.
---
Oh woe is me. I didn't get me free internet shit because I had better things to do. The entitlement to free shit is astonishing.
---
i remember another big alliance straight up running in WWB, hmmm
---
&gt; Its a 50k coalition, with its 40k allies vs a 25k coalition, what did you expect.
---
Numbers is not really the issue, only titan numbers matter, in a age where dirty afk rorqual mining and dirty supercarrier korean APM farming are the best way to get money, casual alliance like Goonswarm can gather a lot of wealth compare to "1337" alliance like NCPL who are not really friendly with PVE Empire. If NCPL get crush (their titan fleet) their will be no hope for new eden in the current meta for at least a few years, really hope CCP will do something about it
---
I've love to know if Goons have more alts on average than other groups and/or what the number of actual Humans is between the two.  Maybe a bit closer than the way it looks on dotlan.
---
Would be nice frankly to have a faction that represents people with slavic heritage.
---
They either need to do that, or somehow increase the drop rates of salvage because there are quite a few types of salvage that are severely bottle-necked. As in - to buy T2 of X type rig you need XXX,XXX of Y type of salvage of which the total volume of that salvage type in Jita sold in the last 90 days doesn't even equal that number.
---
You must be new around here.
---
yeah. CCP need to make other playstyles than titans online viable
---
A+ title
---
TBH it hardly even matters. There's so little content out there about the market side of EVE, which makes sense because talking about it means giving away your advantage, so I'm just happy to have found a trader.
---
I too remember all the citadels goons had there to help them fight the defensive war.
---
sir I accuse you of flair baiting
---
-I'm not solo. You'll notice my beams barely tracked. My ship exists as a very hard to kill tackle/screening ship. This should also answer #2 - my scram isn't there as a defensive scram. It's there to shut off mwd of whatever's tackled. Also, I'm typically flying this in a gang with multiple extremely expensive lokis that all have webs and are 100mn. Scram stops anything fast enough to catch us, and their webs help with their application vs small stuff. Same thing applies to the polycarbs. This isn't a solo ship, this is a tackle/screening ship. My dps doesn't matter nor does my range. The only thing I'd potentially swap my rigs for is more locking range since succubus naturally has very low locking range.
---
If/when I swap to pulses nothing else really changes. 
---
I just noticed that most of what I shot was drones on me, and pulses will probably track better luck. Same if I tackle/peel an af or ceptor or tackle frig.
---
Are they seperate instances like the abyss or deadspace like in sansha incursions? How do you find them? through the agency? Are the rewards isk and CONCORD LP like in Sansha incursions?
---
:sigh: 
---
I guess I'll just log into SISI myself. There seems no way around it.
---
I wasn't sure whether or not Test would ally with NC and burn Delve with Goons away or whether they'd just hit targets of opportunity thereabouts, of either side.
---
See my last response one up. My damage doesn't matter, I'm just tackle/screen.
---
I would agree with that assessment. But there will probably be at least one renter salty over losing a big toy in build that will spill over to reddit and it will be a laughable read.
---
&gt;if they want to suffer through the grind
---
i mean, they're miners, what grind?
---
Goons winning the war before it's even started
---
True but they got ruined pretty much every fight.  There's no shame in retreating if the enemy overwhelms you.  Shield and Sword.  Sometimes you use the shield (retreat).  The Galaxy is quite big after all.
---
just disband than you never have to worry about your space any more
---
I'd like to see new regions that open up to other regions, but you have to repair the gates to open up the new systems (you could get to the systems by wormholes too). In my opinion this would be exciting because it would be a race to claim these new areas of Eve. It would give people something to fight over. Plus CCCP could make exploration more interesting this way too.
---
I’m sure this will leave the average NC. line member brimming with confidence that their alliance can repel the up coming Goon onslaught in the North . . . .
---
Yes. Number one: that's terror
---
Burn delve really
---
imagine thinking citadels matter in big bloc warfare
---
The side with most titans will win, a doesn't do shit when there is 1k titans on grid
---
offering relatively low priced consultation on what to do and how to do ... getting evicted.
---
Not sure if they are available, as I said this is just from hoboleaks so could be wrong. It does sound like incursions 2.0 though
---
I'm just going to deploy for the sweet movop screenshots.  Looks like we're getting blueballed for six weeks.
---
Why have you handed in your surrender already? I thought you liked super fights.
---
Oh well.
---
You are forgetting just half of our super capital fleet is enough to fight in the north
---
Yes correct. My reply was more towards getting the new players into more active money making instead of VNI/afk ratting.
---
And on topic to OP: ratting, selling loot and salvaging.
---
the only eve related mod i know of and have installed is the amarr ship mod. as the name suggests you can choose the amarr ships in the empire creation screen (they will still function like stellaris ships, just look different)
---
aye
---
The grind to actually undock and maybe spend more than a month actually doing PvP under jammed systems ... the horror.
---
who are you? i dont recognize your reddit
---
I think the idea is that there will be no onslaught, just boredom.
---
Makes fleet movement a thousand times easier
---
Took me 5 minutes to figure out who the fuck "Vinny D" is.  Priceless.
---
Inb4 it was just a plot to destroy their rigs and Imperium isn't deploying
---
Too true.
---
Now I need more EvE friends. :(
---
Remove alt-accounts. It's impossible I know, but imagine.
---
For all the spy-gamers you could add a fake identity option which could cost ISK (paying someone for hacking and forging your database entries etc).
---
Praise His Name!
---
NC and SkillU and pushing the little corps that are not rentes in Dronelands, as far i know from a guy there.
---
They run from the people who can fight so they need to feel bad ass with little corps of 15 guys in 0.0 ir 0.1 XD.
---
They need place for their bots, sadly.
---
Why do people bring up incursions as a failed and abandoned thing? It's still valid for isk making, brings people together and even a braindead F1 vindi has way more interactive gameplay than doing combat sites or mining in null. Flying logi is even a fun thing to do once in a while. 
---
A better example for a stupid thing that got abandoned would be mining wars I guess.
---
lmfao.
---
One person prob got popular with it so of course everyone else had to copy it so they could be cool too.
---
1DQ. My point was none of the 4 empires pays for these facilities as the structure is entirely capsuleer controlled.
---
A couple of days ago : everyone shitting on TAPI for having to many blues. 
---
Now : Everyone laughing at PanFam for not having enough blues
---
Ok you made me laugh, but i can agree with you.     
---
When you compare shooting those structures to mining/ratting goons do on monthly basis ... **what grind**
---
Because co2 had betrayed us and were trying to trap us.
---
They'll just obey their overlord obviously (not blaming em, it's the only thing they can do).
---
I also remember last year, when goons killed northern keepstars and citadels crucial to the defensive war. That was when the north was united, now the numbers are going to be less balanced. Cant be too surprised panfam are taking precautions, and will still have plenty of citadels for goons to come munch on over the summer.
---
The difference is, you can start or stop mining to suit you.
---
Bashing structures is on someone else's timetable.
---
Apparently Goons are deploying armor AND shield, unless that changes Saturday.  We'll see.
---
I'm sitting in 15W - KS is in fact unanchoring.
---
i really feel sorry for line members if they have had unrigged tataras and ECs
---
Is it wrong that I am happy there will be that many less structures to grind through?
---
Why would you? You know they wont undock lmao
---
You are a real moron
---
I doubt that would happen. Test and Goons have a 'cooperation' agree when it comes to sov.
---
While it would be more healthly for the game, its not likely to happen.. well not until the mango's are fully weaponized :).
---
only in your head
---
It's time cephei
---
Rigs arent destroyed until it unanchors all the way.
---
Why?
---
&gt;	A couple of days ago : PanFam trolls shitting on TAPI for having to many blues.
---
&gt;	Now : Non-panfam posters laughing at PanFam for not having enough blues
---
Fixed that for you.
---
Fight what?
---
It kind-of happened 3 years ago.  Everybody piled onto Goons, even allies.
---
Tbh, regardless of what happens we'll probably end up with the space again. Goons will get bored and leave. Happens literally every time.
---
It is true. They are un-anchoring everything. Just the word that goons may be deploying was enough to scare NCPL to lose a fuck ton of money.
---
Bruh didn’t bend the knee, he broke the knee.
---
🏡
---
Uhhh no they had actually betrayed us at that point, the night we moved our super fleet is the night they flipped and 100% if we'd used their stager as a mid point they would have flipped on us then.
---
Your Celestis nummer.
---
can't there be a fight for anything
---
Pretty much whatever is thrown at it
---
Nope they're getting fucked.
---
Depending on your tz  options are origin., goons, init., test, P. Horde, snuffed out
---
So are you happy to have the d-scan immune recons not able to light cynos? Cynos and the "suddenly a pile of capitals / supers" are the big difference between null and j-space that to my mind justify local.
---
You can't do hole control. Infiltrating a large enemy force doesn't needs years of elite preparation to get the freighters with supplies in.
---
I'm sorry what? The first part had me dying is it true
---
Because incursions ARE dead, there's a small fraction of the player base keeping them alive, what used to be 10 active incursion groups contesting the sites is now one or two. Only people to do incursions are people who can't mine /rat safely in null or people who multi box like 4 vindis in the post downtime fleet
---
bots are rampant
---
economy is fucked
---
no small gang pvp
---
rorqual mine or gtfo
---
plex prices
---
skill injecortos
---
csm back scratching there alliances
---
You know what’s really not fun? Shooting an entire region’s worth of uncontested structures. It’s pretty lame but it’s the only thing they can really do. Hope some people burn out of the grind (“my feet hurt” “I wish I were home mining right now”).
---
That's some serious spin there, chief. 
---
You realize these citadels are more than just places to dock up your VNI, right? Without proper infrastructure, ratting, mining, and industry in null becomes a far riskier endeavor. On top of that, any builds for your new cap/super/titan that are in the oven are going to be cancelled, and any not in the oven are now delayed for an unspecified amount of time.
---
Goons aren't going to lose morale for a victory won without lifting a finger - if anything Panfam linemembers are going to question their own ability to bounce back from this. 
---
Say those structures are kept in cold storage for a few months till things settle down: 
---
-The south will still be building caps, supers, and titans while waiting for that first Panfam fortizar to start anchoring. 
---
-Panfam thinks the dust has settled and starts anchoring stuff.
---
-The south smells content and gets ready for deployment. 
---
-Panfam realizes they can't compete with the south's numbers and begins to unanchor everything.
---
-Repeat step 1.
---
Goons just have to make an announcement for NCPL to give up nullsec. Goddamn
---
Fair enough.
---
But this kind of explain size of their super fleet.
---
I miss battle clinic...
---
It was talked about on TIS, said they wanted do to that aswell as add a actual physics system so it would work. Also mentioned things like ships not being able to shoot through each other.
---
"Prestige", I dont think you know what that word means 
---
unless irony
---
I started in 2010, and compared to other games EvE has pretty much stayed the same experience wise. The sound track was better imo, but that’s about it. Ship balancing patches are not things I feel nostalgic about, so I have no idea what you’re talking about and I’m led to believe you’re more nostalgic about that phase of your life and people you met rather than to a particular phase of the game.
---
Cough... missed a name there...
---
100%
---
It's weird by the server has fewer than that logged in most days in total.  Alt counting is not a very good way to measure these things.
---
1. Join a pure WH PvP corp
---
2. Pay for subscription with money
---
3. Fuck the rest.
---
Ah right.
---
Was more of a "how cool would it be" thing as a real proposal though, right?
---
Doubt it, never flown one.
---
I mean, the numbers weren't even close to as skewed as these.
---
Difference was in thousands, not tens of thousands.
---
Alt numbers are definitely higher in alliances like nc. Pl and init, and lower in alliances like goons, horde and test
---
Overall alt pr human is definitely higher in Imperium than in panfam
---
So probably not a whole lot.
---
You can't squat in the capsule, Ivan.
---
solo - low sec, multibox - wh
---
What kind of PvE do you want to do? What do you even mean by defense/escape in PvP?
---
Anyways, you ask for caldari and missile. The caldari have one or two missile ships in each size class and they all have a bonus to range:  
---
Frigate - Kestrel  
---
Destroyer - Corax  
---
Cruiser - Caracal  
---
Battlecruiser - Drake  
---
Battleship - Raven  
---
Ravens are decent in lvl 4 missions if you don't want to use pirate ships. In general there are also T2 versions, navy versions and pirate hulls.
---
Realistically yeah... Since it would require changing a lot of stuff. Probably re-writing the game. Idk. You never know though
---
Hedliner ? The virtual Angela Merkel of PanFam ?
---
The thing is we don't really know do we.  CCP do and maybe alliance leadership.
---
blob and elite pvp are mutually exclusive
---
ITT all the people not remembering the quick evac to Saranen pre-citadel lmao
---
Im not sure it would, it would primarily make rental alliances "better" again. Sit in your own space and have other pay you fees. That sure sounds better then try to move 1000's of player every few months.
---
At the time the meta guns where Substantially cheaper
---
Highsec relic / data sites are much lower value than in other spaces.
---
If they timezone tank everything it might be a grind for some, while the majority will be shipspinning all the time.
---
But we do, just check your discord servers
---
There is no irony in it. Replace "prestige" by "bragging rights" and it's basically the same.
---
In theory, that works... however.
---
Goons have proved over and over again that if you don't resist them, they just burn through all of your stuff (maybe even stuff outside of their original target).  From what I have seen, they don't care about grinding.  They also seem far less impacted by a loss of morale just due to sheer numbers.
---
A loss like that by NC/PL would be a hard pill for themselves and their members to swallow I think.
---
Because you were the largest coalition at the time and that was the only way to do so. Funny how that works huh
---
&gt;no small gang pvp
---
Come to wormholes for that- no supers and most times no capitals at all. Just small gang PvP.
---
No this is not true, if you ask any new player they will want o fly capitals, its the goal and dream of (close too) every new player.
---
Looks like similar rewards to sansha based on hoboleaks, however no sisi sites to run yet.
---
Thing is im not sure its that unbalanced, suggestions here is not to "balance" the economy, its to punish cooperation between active players in favor for passive players. 
---
i bet if goons went to High sec they could would still beat most of eve in income by just running incursions.
---
In the same way in which it enables ships to come to a dead stop despite having no front-facing thrusts.
---
Your own leaders have been saying for over a year that that was made up tho:
---
&gt;INITMalcanis: Speaking for INIT., CO2 were absolute bros in providing a distraction with their ablative keepstar. First timer let us farm a bunch of super kills, second one let us extract all our supers.
---
&gt;Wait, what, some people still believe that CO2 actually betrayed the Imperium?
---
and
---
&gt;c02 backstab was pretty good propaganda coup and now we're all together in the south again :D
---
On paper. As was seen when we were actually attacked a lot of that paper strength was nonsense and backstabbers.
---
Big of true.
---
Goons?
---
No You.
---
Back then the political climate was very different. Test was pushed out of Fountain by the CFC. They joined in WWB, after it finished they were attacked by their former 'allies' (PanFam) and goons of all people helped them.
---
Test culture is also similar to goons (or more so than NC./PL).
---
Again, would be fun to see, but doubt it would happen :(
---
Meaningless.
---
Ha with GOTG we would have this in the bag lamo
---
&gt; economy is fucked
---
Not really
---
&gt; no small gang pvp
---
That's literally wrong. Harder yes, but gone not at all.
---
&gt; rorqual mine or gtfo
---
I too only base myself of reddit for what is viable to make isk
---
&gt; csm back scratching there alliances
---
Eeerh no.
---
Mine for 13 hours a day or shoot at a strucutre doesnt really change much still going to be in game
---
Ask for numbers
---
Gets numbers
---
Doesn't believe numbers
---
Lol gtfo
---
/r/evejobs 
---
as someone who recently joined a wormhole corp, I strongly recommend you check out wormholes if you haven't already.
---
Police Skin for frigate is available in CONCORD lp store.
---
Mined minerals are free if you're a NEET cause your time is worthless )))
---
⛵
---
Maybe you shoulda tried helping them fight earlier in the war instead of just ratting whilst they meatshielded :thinking:
---
Didn't ask for numbers.  Didn't get numbers - got arm waving about Discord.  LOL-LOL THANNY, TOONY.
---
Saranen 2.0
---
It's still a better option then letting Imperium burn it all down. There's simply nothing the north can do against it.
---
France atleast tried to fight us germans...
---
Maybe we can crowd fund him a pair of those plastic knee replacements.
---
Sadly all they do is sell you new paint for your toy excavator
---
seriously does nobody remember how many structures got burned in fade/pure blind? we turned that place largely into a fucking wasteland with pure, home-grown organic autism.
---
We are at peace with co2. We have always been at peace with co2.
---
Having been drinking with Mittens in Iceland when we stole the co2 flag and ran around using it as a beer mat for 3 hours - the current narrative is the propeganda.
---
It was tens of thousands. [65,621 characters were involved. We counted.](https://pst.klgrth.io/paste/tfkpp6np9khhqq57jdwrhp2h) We were ground down to 16k at our lowest point.
---
&gt; It's just a hobby.
---
Bob help me. If this is just a hobby, you’re some kind of whiz kid or something.
---
Wow. It is seriously impressive. I hope you’re bored more.
---
Unbelievable.
---
I'm not arguing about the whys of them flipping, just the actual fact that it happened.
---
Holy shit that is awesome.
---
Our Aussie TZ contingent does most of the grinding because for some reason, PanFam thinks we're weakest in this timezone (when in fact, it's actually quite strong thanks to Aussies, Russians, NZ and Chinese). We've become masters at grinding structures as a hobby and art form. :)
---
Imagine declaring the Fabian strategy in tyool 2019
---
But with mining, I can pick which 13 hours.
---
Oh thanks!
---
Assumed they were only available from the cash shop, i'll check it out.
---
Is it weird, that I don't even remember how I made my first billion.
---
Can we please not. I dont want space anymore.
---
Panfam can’t compete now let’s be honest, if they fight now (a full invasion) they will loose and loose a lot of isk, under a full invasion ratting/mining will drop off anyway. Slash and burn now on their terms is better than burning under goons superior numbers. And I’m if being honest the north will fight, and it’s going to be a shit show (if it’s a full invasion) just say fuck our territory in the north move south engage in full bomber industry burn in the south. Goons can do what ever they want in the north there’s going to be nothing there! nc/pl will all be down south, not taking anything but harassing industry
---
&gt;Hawkeye doing more damage than Iron Man
---
Totally fake.
---
What skills will help with CPU usage? I'm mining in a Mackinaw and trying to upgrade my Afterburner but the one I bought uses too much CPU.
---
I think there is a meme of some kid screaming -10 DKP! -DKP!  for some negative action another person in the alliance did.
---
You have problems understanding sarcasm.
---
Yeah I probably over sold GotG here, but they were a nice trash bag that could be used as a buffer and a meat shield.
---
hol up
---
Elite super and titan fleet
---
yep, I remember a similar thing as well
---
Delete all supers and titans permanently. No reimbursement, no nothing, just flat out remove them (and the ability to ever build more). Dreads and carriers become the biggest ships, because dread fights are fucking fun. Case in point: https://zkillboard.com/br/109338/, this is probably the best fight I've had in the last 18 months.
---
Yeah I know it's a second change but you can then add some sort of bridging capital that does literally nothing else, has no offensive ability, etc.
---
Note: I have 5 titans and 3 supers and that fact is fucking absurd. Delete them all.
---
&gt; ablative keepstar
---
lmao I love that phrasing.
---
just kidding, it's pretty awesome.
---
if you did this yourself from scratch, you could do this for a living *easily*
---
Except its the case where these people bragg how they chaced kids away from the playground with a larger gang.
---
We should NOT deploy then laugh at them. haha!
---
With 45k people so can we :P
---
Of course, but the SNI can't kite, so you're left to brawl, which it can kind of do since it does get a decent tank. Personally though, i just fly with torpedo's when using the SNI. Lose some tank for application, but no reload and a sustained a 1k dps.
---
Wouldn't be surprised if some part of plnch leadership gets banned in the near future.
---
More than likely.
---
I think my seaman will see more use than my main in this war.
---
without the PVE guys, there would be no items to PVP with.... its all connected
---
Never underestimate the old guard's thirst for destroying structures.
---
You can buy most of them just on the market too with isk. Some are expensive, but available.
---
It's not just that they let us be, it's that they didn't engage in the arms race with us. They are sat still, when they needed to be running just to keep up.
---
 Time to cool "didn't want that space anyway" story
---
I have to admit, when we lost Deklein and Pure Blind a few years ago and were all basically, camped in to a tiny little station in Saranen, I never thought I'd see the day where, we sneeze and NCPL run like scared little girls before we even arrive on grid... It's a blessing to live through this moment!
---
Sad that all goos have to do is say there invading and everyone shits the bed. Understandable but sad.
---
That being said, in empire space, the fluid routers that transfer your consciousness to a new clone *do* belong to them. 
---
I think TCUs are technically a fluid router but only pilots from that alliance use it
---
Yea and how did that go for them?
---
If Vince is still afk for this it will be Orville Redenbacher time as EFT and krabbing experts make strategic decisions for NC
---
This counts as a kill btw
---
Yeah the thing about trash bags is that eventually their contents start to rot and smell though.
---
Hey, it's at least a chance that we'd wear ourselves out tearing down all their trash and not have enough steam left to killdoze all yours too. That's what happened last time.
---
I was there and i know what a massive grasp and load of bs this plot point was with no evidence to back it up at all.
---
If what you say is true What a sad state of the game don't you think?
---
Because a group is so big (and powerful) that other groups prefer avoid them and leave the space they were.
---
So we will have even more empty space.
---
With the north not a power anymore it lefts legacy. 
---
Either they will unite and become a gigapower or they will fight them and remove them due to superior firepower and number.
---
In the end there be temporary groups in null until they got evicted by the imperium, no super and titans fights, not that they were happening often or enjoyable with heavy tidi.
---
But the good point is that maybe lowsec will be more populated^^
---
Think of the MER though
---
Honestly not suprised. Former NC i can tell you till they stop with  the whole killbaord warrior ping attitude they  cant win in the current meta.  They need to pick a region consolidate there industry under there super umbrella  and build like fuck.   But again the where elite means this will probably nver happen
---
Drifter incursions are a literal failed thing. It was not ready for release and so buggy that they got removed and quietly buried.
---
Total retreat = brilliant
---
Yikes.
---
#reavers
---
&gt; And you know Legacy are going to be there to third-party too if there is a whiff of a super fight happening.
---
There's a pretty consistent rule about our behaviour when it comes to third partying: if PL is involved on one side, there's a 99% chance we'll be on the other side trying to ruin their day.  The Camal KS was the only departure from this in recent memory.
---
Interesting opinion, but I work and take online classes at a state university, so... no.
---
We have the bots on the run. The Brown Eyed War hasn't even kicked off proper and already these botting havens are closing up shop. As the official anti-botting CSM candidate this makes me very happy.
---
This is what we call 'Punching downwards!'
---
WTB a particular pipe system
---
if pl/nc have to raze their own regions and flee just on the rumor we're coming they're basically not able to own anything larger than an asshouse for the forseeable future
---
that sounds fun as hell to me

5D chess confirmed
---
France was comparable in size and manpower, this not the same at all.
---
1. Why? What value does it add? Because you're rarely going to have the CSM agree on everything (and shouldn't). 
---
2. You know, and I know, that the CSM doesn't get things made. That's not its purpose. And that 'little things' often aren't actually little. And by having people vote on them, you're offering a false sense that they'll actually get done. 
---
3. I agree here, though 'engage' is somewhat tricky to define.
---
You don't seems very familiar with Eve online warfare.
---
Amazing. :D
---
80% of Panfam titans are produced in Branch by GOTG builders not sure if you're aware.
---
im sorry that you are supporting the bbb
---
I'd give that to cloaky recons instead of their cloak. 5s local delay / level in recon ships.
---
Lol OK dude.
---
I hauled freight for Red Frog, back when you didn't have to worry about catalysts and suicide ganking. Was a very long time ago needless to say.
---
You know that they can still evac the assets while the citadel is reinforced. And I don't see a small-mid sized corp being able to keep their advantage against a larger group.
---
if this isnt cringe idk what is
---
is narrative is getting old
---
Once they're done up north, you'll be next
---
Rename it star citizens
---
It's casino war 2
---
Well yes, but that's on NC/PL to have allied with them and also many other strategic mistake in the long run that are leading up the current state of NS and Goonswarm domination.
---
&gt;It’s an incredibly smart move if true(which it’s not), the north can’t win, in the long term! against the south. So you use scorched earth tactics, if they invade take down every station, retreat from ever engagement don’t engage them! Frustrate them at ever level. And yes a lot of people are going to get extremely frustrated, on both sides! but the enemy will start to not turn up to fights and slowly but surely loose moral till the point they go home, then the north can just undock and retake the region, It’s a legitimate tactic. The north CANT complete with the south’s numbers.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;The best tactic is to just say to goons yes you are the most powerful Corp in eve! Probably have more than a 1000 Titans, you can steam roll anything and anyone you want! But we as your main enemy will run and not engage with you in any fights! you move that large force about Eve all you like but your going to do nothing with it, See how fun that sounds to goons And for the love of god why are there no permanent sigs in goon space constantly harassing goon industry. I really don’t get people’s tactics.
---
Remember what goons/ Imperium did in 2016 before the citadel patch that everyone made fun out of them for doing?
---
I like how there was no numbers anywhere in the conversation you are referring to
---
but reddit told me that the gons were dead in wwb. i reeeead an /r/games post about it.
---
its almost like we told them how to win 2 years ago and they didnt listen
---
Well it worked for the Romans’
---
After looking at the options I am going to join the grrrr goons. Also today at noon in cobalt edge I may or may not self destruct a titan. Looking at the current cost of like 75b it's not worth the pain to move it. Also looks like the goons are in something called imperium amd not the cfc anymore. How bad can they be.
---
Fade and Pure Blind have always been desolate shit holes. Why do you think alliances like GENTS, SMA, TNT, CO2 and MOA lived there?
---
I mean he is a politician irl so...
---
how can you kill the coon when you are the coon joseph
---
Dear sir, how dare you insinuate that upright principled members of NC. and PL leadership would liquidate a large portion of alliance assets, and RMT them for cash outside of the game as they quit while screwing over the naive portion of their alliance they have left who are too stupid to have jumped ship already. Blasphemous sir. Vince Draken and /u/Rageliner will see you with their seconds at dawn to demand satisfaction.
---
but enough about pl, the subject was GotG
---
You can literally brag about whatever you want on this sub if your brigade is big enough. Ironically or otherwise.
---
Good to know :P just been testing on sushi before I take it out hunting ratting caps and shit. ECCM sebos for Max effect
---
I told him where to get them, I'm not going to do the work for him
---
Imagine getting baited into subbing all of your accounts just so the Mittani has more people to tell who to vote for CSM.
---
Sheep. Lmao.
---
100% now, considering you're not able to own sotyios anymore
---
As long as hulk is the strongest avenger I think we’re okay
---
Yeah making the hardpoints targetable/disable-able would go a long way. 
---
Just being on grid with the old stations in null was a great way to provoke content. What do we do now? Wait on a gate like bitches more often than not.
---
So you guys just anchor Tataras and Sotiyos all over the place for.....the feng shui balance of your structure placement?
---
Yes, but why brigade when you can just use what's happening. Much easier, much more reddit cred.
---
Not an ISK sink. ISK sinks are way that remove the ISK permanently from game. This just moves it from one player to another.
---
Nah Sort would just break open another piggy bank and pay you to come to Tribute anyway. At least this way we don't have to be blue to him anymore :)
---
Why would you need to move 400titans and 2xsubcap fleets around, when there is 800titans and 4xsubcap fleets waiting for you to de-tether ?
---
This is what happens when you decide to become slumlord rental empire alliance. I hope it all burns.
---
I think you guys are underestimating ncpl.
---
Can't be memed about undocking if they have no structures. Next level space chess
---
no large scale pvp either considering the thread title
---
Are you able to code different things in c++ while having other parts of the code work with stackless python?
---
I mean, anyone who thought they would defend Tribute when they can just redeploy to Delve was nuts.
---
Remember how many rorqs were lost last time GOONS deployed?  
---
All that being said, &lt;3 GOONS grr NC/PL
---
Lose not loose!
---
That's what stukas are for m8
---
Ahh this is peak beanposting
---
They need to adapted or die. Life for Eve's barbarian hordes are dying. With Citadels civilization building and spod brain is the future. Honestly them attacking TEST and CO2 will go down as one of the biggest diplomatic mistakes in Eve.
---
you can get a new titan for 40b in delve :D
---
we would never! :pearlsclutched:
---
Update/rebalance Rp production. Research seems like a discarded feature, yet so much time can or may have already been invested in it. In that vein, I would also like to rebalance the LP cost of Datacores in FW LP stores
---

---
My corp and this community is the only thing keeping me in this game.
---
LOL, just need alts for the alts :P
---
nice to see panfam gettin taste of their own shit. remeber when panfam just blobbed everything with supers? finally they are on receiving end lmao
---
Are you saying that when Aryth did the deal with sort, Goons still had fuel in the tank and the line “our FC’s are burned out” was bullshit ?
---
Whs can be blobby in their own way. Put up a fight against one of the big WH corps and they will batphone everyone.
---
Its the end of roaming hordes looking for content. Its time to build a civilization or get rolled by one. I want a strong north to welp against :&lt;
---
The original Tour de France.
---
Because what's happening (facts) are distinct from what's "happening" (narrative) the brigade is important to ensure one trumps the other.
---
Let's be real any time you have like 50,000 toons on a server that barely can have 18,000 total people logged in at any given moment what do you expect? These blobs are out of control.
---
Can someone explain me what happen ? I'm a newbie and i do not understand what's going on ...
---
Jesus christ, when did everyone in this game turn into such pussies? Fights go sideways and unexpected things happen all the time in Eve, but running away guarantees a loss. this game won't die because of CCP, this game will die because risk-averse turbonerds do shit like this instead of, god forbid, fighting an actual war.
---
Still, we're not talking thousands of players, heavy TiDi, hundreds or thousands of supers and titans.
---
And how would u deal with a full goon invasion?
---
CPU Management (5% bonus to ship CPU output per level)  
---
Powergrid Management (5% bonus to ship powergrid output per level)
---
Then it will be a skill specifically for whichever module it applies to, for example:
---
High Speed Maneuvering: reduces MWD capacitor usage by 5% per skill level
---
Afterburner: reduces AB duration by 5% per level and capacitor use by 10% per level  
---
Weapon Upgrades: reduces the capacitor need of turrets/launchers/smartbombs by 5% per level  
---
You can also check out the Eve Uni writeup on optimizing your capacitor usage here:  
---
[Capacitor Management 101](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Capacitor_Management_101)
---
Hope this has helped! :D
---
Buying the charter from the LP store is the sink.
---
That you guys view Sort Dragon's decision to pay us off as a *betrayal* still boggles my mind. He bought you ungrateful jerks a shitload of time, and didn't ask for anything in return.
---
In before NCPL call a cultural revolution to drop all the holier than thou anti krabbing killboardwarrior shit and WIdot into Horde to rebuild into an actual 2019 superpower
---
TEST Culture is an offshoot of Goon culture. I'd argue culturally no entity in the game has closer culture to TEST than Goons.
---
Alpha wormhole exploration. Took like 3 month to my first 4 bil. Also teached me how to survive in J-Space without a cloak :P
---
Alright. This guy won the thread. We can all stop and go home now.
---
Large lower skill alliances tend to have less multiboxers as a whole. Its not as vital for surviving in comparison to more elitepeeveepee style gameplay
---
To be fair, skynet only became an issue when drone mods started applying to fighters. I'd fight current carriers every day of the week vs pre-nerf no tank max application/speed/dmg revenant skynet as a small gang pvper.  The only thing CCP fucked up is the ease at which old supers/carriers could be defanged. Much more difficult now, especially with the ECM changes.
---
im not sure "not only are you going to make us burn everything we own and tuck tail and run just by showing up, but you're also going to extend your dominance over the GSM!!!!!!!" is as much of a burn as you think it is
---
Charters cost isk to buy from the LP store so yes it would be a sink.
---
By this reasoning the only way to be able to own anything is being blue to Imperium like Legacy, since Panfam is still the 2nd or 3rd strongest group. This would mean the end of any meaningful war in Eve (which would be very bad for Imperium in the long run i imagine).
---
He betrayed Horde not NCPL that's why Horde went to war with GOTG in Branch. NCPL actually refused to get involved no one really considered it a betrayal.
---
I doubt it was BS.  I do remember those hot summer evenings last year.  So at least the UK FCs were probably slow roasting every night for a month.  Explains why this year's vacation is a month early.
---
Not everybody wants to play eve like a fag
---
Everyone knows how to win in the current meta and has done for years. But wanting to do Eve’s pve, or recruit everything with a pulse that does, is not a sacrifice everyone is willing to take.
---
*Krab is back on the menu boys...*
---
Wonder how well this was communicated - if more than a few PamFam will now have shit in asset safety to extract.  That’ll do wonders for morale.
---
Delve is going to be dope
---
Inc before a Gate to Triglavian Spaces comes before the Stain Gate !
---
tell molle we'll set evol up in c9n. drop a keep right on steve, just y'all though.
---
Remember when the Mittani tried goaded a guy into committing suicide and now you all just want that conveniently forgiven and forgotten?
---
Reminder that if your response is longer than a sentence then it's too much effort to be a good troll.
---
How convinient that you are blue to literally every other faction in the game except for the one that PL is in
---
There are an eve ship mod which I used to create all of the NPC factions in eve in a huge galaxy game. RN im playing as the Khanid, allied to the Syndicate and destroyed the Rogue Drones in a war.
---
They won two world wars.  
---
Next question.
---
pl/nc is fifth best at most, and that's being generous by including horde, which is significantly stronger than either
---
PvE heavy gameplay scales with alts doesn't it.  You know, ratting (VNI), mining and so on.  And there's a lot more of that going on in Delve than elsewhere according to MER.  
---
So my question still stands really.  I think we'll see what's in local on deployment.
---
I think this is what you're looking for? [https://eve-nt.uk/designer/](https://eve-nt.uk/designer/)
---
the last vestiges of cool and good pvp are 1) low sec 2) wormholes 3) with origin against legacy or with quiet/skillu/lazerhawks in the drone regions. otherwise you're getting into huge blobs or ~elite player versus player combat~
---
I didn't mean the "war in Branch," I meant seeing it as a negative thing at all for any reason. It's not like you guys went to war *anywhere* in the interim anyways.
---
Damn hard knocks doesn’t have anyone with the skillbook to take a titan?
---
I mean goons totally don't post their actual member count every month or anything......
---
there were more citadels in fade and pure blind than there are in tribute right now
---
&gt;Goons aren't going to lose morale for a victory won without lifting a finger
---
They will eventually get frustrated from having no fights. Internal propaganda has done a brilliant job postponing that day, but in the end it will eventually get them.
---
Incursions for me.  However unless you join a group that's friendly towards newbies like the goonswarm Incursion sig is (allowing tech 1 cruisers) you'll need some good skills and a good amount of cash for a starter battleship. But hey, nothing beats 100-200 mil an hour.
---
The way they do Skins leaves a lot to be desired...
---
I would love to see a single Skin offered for a particular hull type. And once you buy it, you can apply that pattern to any of the hulls. Like if you buy something for the Moa, it can also be applied to the Eagle, Onyx, and Gila. Instead of making us pay for the same Skin each time for each hull. And making it so the Gila can't use most of the Moa Skins b/c "it's a Faction ship".
---
I'd also love to see them open up the various Skins to all the ships. Like the Police Skin for instance. Why is it only offered for 3x ships in the whole game? Why not offer it for every Gallente ship out there?
---
https://i.imgur.com/SjeY9Pn.jpg
---
This was made from https://eve-nt.uk/designer/ which lets you pick any Hull and any Skin and it puts them together. So don't tell me the CCP Art Dept is working tirelessly to make these things. All they need to do is label parts of the ships A, B, C... and then the Skin says "make all the A parts Red, and all the B parts White..." and taa daa, you've got a new look.
---
Already is.
---
You're only isk positive if you get on the actual killmail. That is the whole point of unanchoring all those structures
---
nice dude
---
this is what I got at this year's CCP Invasion Tour in Saint Petersburg, Russia - https://i.imgur.com/98emyTL.jpg :) love it 
---
o7 Guard
---
I don't at all! NC has always been nomadic, and that's why a lot of people join and enjoy playing here. If winning means building a stationary, impregnable krab fortress then I don't want any part of that! And that's no shade thrown at the goon/Delve model, if you're having fun then go for gold, but it's not for everyone.
---
I hate to break the news to you Jay, but many of us are not interested in building a northern version of your Smugtopia. That playstyle killed the China server and would kill this one aswell.
---
This "war" is going to be like game of thrones
---
&gt;!The hyped up battles and the suspense of who will live and who will die will be built up by both sides. In the end, it will just be the mittani, much like arya, doing the one swift action that kills everything. The people everyone expects to die will survive, nothing major will be lost for the imperium + bluetrals and we all go home disappointed. The imperium will be paid off to let the smaller guys grow only to become jist strong enough to die swinging. Blame the writers. !&lt;
---
 Goons grew too much and now it's be steamrolled or blue ball them. Live to fight another day, but never really fight. The only hope for having some real action is all of these blues reset standings, start fighting each other and wage a war of attrition. Damn the killboard to hell, just burn everything. It will never happen and so we are left with the small guerilla tactics that doesn't do any real damage because the weight of the super capital umbrellas is too much to bear.
---
Goonswarm and allies are preparing an invasion of Nothern Coalition. and Pandemic Legion systems. Goons are stronger than NC. and PL, so rather than lose structures that they can't defend, NC. and PL are unanchoring them to scoop them, only loosing the rigs in the process.
---
Note that much of this is reddit talk. AFAIK Goons still have to move their super capital fleet, and we don't really have confirmation of the structure unanchoring.
---
We would still have to move stuff since unanchoring takes a week and be canceled.
---
lol buddy, we shoot at each other already. we just don't play shity sov games.
---
Thats not what happened the last time. the last time CO2 was meatshielding for GOTG and pretty much the second CO2 collapsed then GOTG surrendered. GOTG did pretty much nothing but botting up in branch during the last invasion, lets be real
---
nc/pl have unanchored all of their structures in space, based on a rumor the imperium is coming to attack them, essentially abandoning any pretension of being a nullsec alliance in the hopes that if they destroy everything they own before we can get there it will somehow be a moral victory and bore us
---
oh boy.
---
Doubt it, if we move ours north, frat will too, cancelling out the titans
---
Care to enlighten me then?  What is it?
---
you're talking about a coalition that literally started an alliance that would accept anyone who could find the application button, even someone named IwillAwoxHorde, who had been kicked from Horde twice before
---
Thats interesting you think elite pvpers dont pve. The best pvpers tend to also be rather rich. If you take the pure amount of people in the coalition, the MER in Delve is actually surprisingly low. Branch has what like 1/10th of the players and 70% of the MER as Delve IIRC
---
For someone who's actually played the game for a long ass time, I can say with confidence Goons have been the largest coalition in the game for probably 9+ years now. Nothing has changed. Its a bit of cute historical revisionism to be like "WeLl GoOnS MuLtIbOX MoRe"
---
The burnout wasn't too bad but restaging further north and basically starting a new campaign would have been really draining.
---
Enjoy :)
---
That could be a fun new mechanic.
---
Give players a way to direct the invasion.
---
Blood sacrifices that attract the invasion force to the system with the most Pod kills?
---
Straight isk bribes to NPC agents that direct the invasion against your enemies?
---
Renters etc. Don't you watch the meta show? All NCPL members are forced to rent systems and put down structures.
---
AH mb. Forgot that those require LP + ISK and not LP only.
---
You don't even play anymore. You got kissed by a girl
---
And this time, GOTG would (theoretically) be meatshielding for NCdot. Same principle applies, even if the names are different.
---
https://puu.sh/DsBZl/dcc9de4c80.jpg
---
I'd be A ok with that too.
---
I read a lot of complaints about C4 anons, spawn distance being the biggest one. But if you’re using cruise missiles who really cares about spawn distance?   You can still apply DPS as they close in on you
---
No we're constantly mining and we just log in our structure bashing alts when we need to bash. The spod is a 23.5/7 job
---
can i have your stuff?
---
Ook ... But if they already unanchoring their structures, they already lost money ?
---
That statement would be true if I based winning on what zkill says as my only metric.
---
I didn't say they don't PvE.  I said the argument that they need more alts is wrong.  And wtf is "elitepvp" anyway?  Sounds like the most unbelievable bollocks to me.
---
&gt; skynet only became an issue when drone mods started applying to fighters
---
except they [mods] didn't apply to assigned fighters because :ccp:
---
Unanchoring takes a week and can be cancelled.
---
I'm having a hard time getting integrated into the WH life. Any tips?
---
Specifically, what kind of things are you having trouble with?
---
Remember when Mittani was kicked off the CSM and temp banned from the game for doing that? We don't want it 'forgiven and forgotten' it's just that he's already been punished for it.
---
You might want to check out mining upgrades, think that’s a reduction in mining upgrade CPU usage.
---
Which in theory boils down to "Buy new books and component BPOs, use the same old moon goo".
---
I shudder to think what mess they'd make if they tried introducing some new trig-only reactions though in theory they need to do racial carbide and meta-material. Maybe they'll make those different flavours of alchemy reactions from all 4 races &lt;shrug&gt;
---
They 100% did. Fighters didn't go 10km/s on their own with perfect application.
---
yes, the rigs on all those structures were destroyed the instant they clicked the unanchor button.  keepstar/sotyio rigs are tens to hundreds of billions each.  tatara rigs, at least the good ones, are around 100b each.
---
talks about risk-averse turbo nerds &gt; is part of the biggest blobbiest group in the game
---
My age is DeepThoughts answer to the ultimate question kiddo. 
---
If you get the reference you might be more than half my age o7
---
I was also there, and it made perfect sense and the timing of them slipping on the night we moved out super fleet was way too convenient for it not to make sense for them to have been trying to trap us.
---
Legacy has more titans than all of Panfam, let alone FRAT.
---
Get ready to scoop boys
---
All wormholes regardless of c status have the best pi in the game

I agree and also that should apply to alpha injectors as well.

Panfam only play to win. Having fun is not part of the agenda.
---
Most definitely not
---
Ran out of meatshields?
---
Getting moved in and finding things to do. Usually in nullsec the content was only a bridge away... now I don't have a local market and don't know where to get started.
---
When you create a coalition that is more than half the game that's kinda what happens
---
The joy of the 5 skill queue back then. Or was it only 3 skills in queue? Can't remember.
---
No I’m not, I’m talking about NCPL.
---
Forgot that appears like they unanchor all their shit before we get there.
---
I mean Yeh if we want to get that far into the lore to justify alienating a huge part of the player base you could likely refuse access for JCs and stuff to empire stations.
---
Yeah I realized C4s don't have statics to K-space so they probably aren't that good for PI
---
You can still access and move things during unanchoring.
---
Elite pvpers need more alts for pvp because they multibox more because they have less people to fill spots in fleet and have the cognitive ability to do so. This is a commonly accepted fact for anybody who has played the game longer than a few months. Thats not to say blob alliances like Goons or TEST don't have talented multiboxers, but the per capita is way lower than somewhere like PL or SkillU, and those alliances are way less than somewhere like HK or LZHX. When i was in HK, you were expected to at minimum triple box in PvP.  Thats not common at all in blob alliances.
---
There is literally no evidence to support Goons have more alts, other than the maybe 0.5 % of players Who run massive rorq fleets. Just accept that Goons are a massive blob and move on. The only person youve convinced is yourself
---
The sad state is that panfam won't even put up a fight. Eve needs a new power force and new leaders to lead them.
---
Do you have a crew on your ship or do you always fly solo?
---
no, see, it doesn't count as blobbing if it's blobbing with supercaps
---
wait what, we no longer have the most supercaps?  nevermind, having the most supercaps is also dishonorable blobbing
---
It's almost like the players in the north doesn't care for that playstyle in this sandbox of ours
---
Me? Lol, no. Try again.
---
GLOBAL TELL ALL YOUR RIGGED STRUCTUREs TO UNANCHOR OR WHATEVER I DON'T WANT THEM TO GET AN EASY WIN ON THE BATTLE REPORT BECAUSE OF FUCKING RIGGGED STRUCTURES
---
Come to Provi
---
not gonna lie, NCdocking citadels is next level
---
Hmmm. ok. Are you part of a corp? They should have some form of wormhole tracker like Siggy or Pathfinder.
---
 This would allow you to see which holes go where, how much mass goes through where. You can then scout and locate a highsec hole and bring your ships and stuff in from Jita (if there's no wardec, obviously)
---
The big bullies are getting what they deserve finally..
---
Huh?
---
Yeah cause that worked out last time didn't it
---
I was there. It was glorious being the Boogeyman of Eve. The meta is the problem, but it's nothing any of us can fix. No CSM member either tbh. It's all on CCP to recreate what they once had.
---
Half of these are corp private structures that have no reason to stay in space.  
---
Why lose that much money if goons burn everything ? Just unanchor shit and deploy elsewhere/another time.  
---
Truth be told, if Goons + Pets + TEST go north to fight, the numbers just aren't there to do anything against it. If TEST was a true third force, it would be doable. But pets will be pets.
---
Was said that we are just going to burn it all down then go home
---
It is still a banable offense,you are just attempting to circumvent the gate protecting you from getting banned.
---
No meatshields... No fight.
---
Station trading in null.
---
Krab-shaks are the best option short of dreads. I assume they have 2-3 RR shaks with 2 SB shaks for frigs.
---
Get someone who actually plays EVE to replace Hilmar.
---
Since Goons does not loose anything yet, for now Goons are winning even if they did nothing ? But the others are loosing billions maybe but not too many compare to what they could loose if they loose their structures, correct ?
---
Tell me the first 4 pls. And if you were thinking about winterCo and HRE, please don't even bother to reply.
---
Oh do fuck off with your "elitepvp" shite will you.  All you're saying is, "this player has played longer than this player and so has more alts", which is a fucking banality.
---
What ship should I be using to haul in and out of the hole, its a C5 and I am in a corp.
---
I remember it, goons at least had started to lose space before the evac, not before any ships moved lol.
---
this is basically what happened on Serenity, PIBC largest competitor ended up as a guerilla alliance before dying.
---
Seems they ran out of meatshields
---
Happy cake day!!

Stukas are useless in a TiDi Fest Keepstar battle, except maybe for bombing in gates.

90k vs 25k, yes PANFAM should stay and fight
---
https://i.imgur.com/f4b2YPB.png
---
Damage caps prevent the simple deletion of troll deployed structures and I think that should be changed.
---
The only way to win the game is not to play?
---
No retard, they are lost when it unanchors, not when you start the process
---
Join Zombie Club, we can hook you up with fits and info, and even fellows to gank with.
---
Not everybody plays with the sole intention to win. Some just play for fun.
---
ask your corp members
---
if they won't help you, find a better corp
---
The problem is the mindset that would build another krab empire is the same mindset that would blue the imperium instead of getting into conflict with them.
---
Right but what if this was not given enough notice and people hadn’t logged in and would have had lots of assets in a keepstar/fort.  Or BPOs in those production facilities.
---
GLOBAL TELL ALL YOUR STRUCTURES TO UNACHOR OR WHATEVER, I DONT WANT'EM LIKE GET AN EASY WIN ON THE BATTLEREPORT BECAUSE OF STRUCTURES PLEASE
---
it's cost us nothing yet.  and pl/nc haven't managed to save anything - it takes a week for those keepstars to unanchor and if we attack them in that time the unanchoring is paused.  and even if they do unanchor, pl/nc then need to scoop them which is ... far from guaranteed.
---
there were also probably tons of industry jobs that are now lost, i would be very surprised if the total damage was anything less than 2t and pretty surprised if the total damage was less than 3t, and it's only going to get worse as those structures die instead of get scooped
---
Oh they hide all their krabbing alts everywhere. It's just public anti-krabbing they chest beat.

That's beyond dumb, you have no idea what you're talking about, I award you no points and may reddit have mercy on your karma.

---
what makes you think they'll be able to scoop these
---
The CPU on Macks it tight. You need to make a choice between max yield and having a tank. That doesn't leave room for extraneous extras. Don't be one of those nerds who leaves midslots unfilled. If you want fitting room for a prop mod, use a Skiff.
---
WH roams or move op camping aside, TEST/Legacy has their hands full with Frat and the south.  I wouldn’t expect Any of Legacy to mobilize in any significant way for this.  This is goons axe to grind.
---
Xboxing anything in eve is a thing
---
We (Goonswarm Federation) announced that our coalition, the Imperium, is going to be deploying all of our PVP forces to a yet-undisclosed location. Northern CoalitionDOT and Pandemic Legion, fearing it will be to their space, are pre-emptively unanchoring many of their owned structures, in an attempt to save them from our wrath. Doing so causes a minimum loss of the structures' rigs (causing hundreds of billions, potentially trillions of ISK in loss), as well as forcing all line member assets into Asset Safety.
---
Is easier to buy from jita and haul my dude
---
PANFAM 25k vs Unspoken 200
---
we stayed and fought.. still fighting.  It can be done.. assuming you know which way to point your pixel ship.
---
You can manufacture metas, they have BPOs
---
Given that Hoboleaks has the components listed &amp; triglav ship wrecks were added but no blueprints for the components were added to the DB im thinking components will come in built form from the incursions. Its unlikely that they'd use normal abyssal loot as rewards for incursion because that would just tank the prices so new materials as loot seems likely.
---
My relic analyzer jammed when I saw this post
---
well stoopid goonies paid for moving late, all their supers are stuck in 93PI now

What I expect? Probably a bare minimum of pride and dignity. When you can trashtalk like a pro and pubstomp guys that can't defend themselves you should have enough balls to defend your stuff.
---
So you won eve then?
---
It's true
---
Playing the game killed the game lol ok
---
The drifter incursions werent an event, it was just bugged to shit and just exploited by a small group of players so CCP pulled it and then gave up on it lol.
---
Remember that this was literally in game for a while. And they took it away. For no good reason. Even though it all looked frigging amazing and a ton of people had fun with it.

Nope, not until the structure actually unanchors.

bro please eve will be dying in 200 years, just like it is dying right now
---
Genuine newbie question, what's to stop them remove structures, because, as people in this thread have said, Goons will bash all structures in a region without breaking a sweat, and then just defending a few structures in a region and taking fights where possible? People are acting like they're going to be avoiding fights entirely, but the fact the title itself says essential doctrines are being left suggests they intend on fighting. Let's be honest if Goons want the North they can take it but surely there's fights to be had
---
Pssst he’s talking about us I think bro
---
It would have fair'ed better as a post if it was a shield super
---
Now see this is why we can’t have nice things dude.  Clean up the language.
---
Mind to share?
---
We could make all ships immune to local, for a week or so just to see how it works.
---
My corp was a member of the last residents of tribute. We fought for months outnumbered and outgunned against panfam defending tribute. 
---
We were later moved fade when imperium invaded and panfam used us as meatshields.
---
We fought to the end in both cases... It was FUN
---
Ye.... sure.... Maybe you should start doing a research and then come back.
---
Oh please do, we'd love to shit on you again.
---
&gt; That playstyle killed the China server and ~~would kill~~ is killing this one aswell.
---
Because the old style of having more supers and throwing them on everything was better... oh wait it is the same as now only that goons have now more.
---
Yeh you're right. I deleted it. Wasnt funny.
---
ban every IP/cc# in GSF. done.
---
Goons - time to go to war
---
Panfam - we surrender
---
Fixed it for you
---
Rattlesnakes might still be better for the solo multiboxer. Each Leshak is one more overview/targeting to manage.
---

---
you forgot the two alliance sized sigs deployed to help you, and test forming for every major objective
---
How about every now and then the links between systems move around so that map changes slightly. Doesn't have to be huge, just the odd few gates re-align to differnet systems over time.
---
The in-game justification can be that gates have malfunctions, so new ones have been set up.
---
lol. Imagine being this retarded and actually posting it
---
It was the same with ncpl years back. They had the titan/super adventage and could do whatever they wanted. With the only difference people still fought back because they had balls.
---
Yeah his shit is in that keepstar and now he’s gonna need a galaxy pack bundle of plex to pull out of safety if he even wants to resub.   Being a homophobe I’m chalking it up to a solid “nothing of value was lost”
---
But... Scooping
---
CQ existing forced them to develop 2 engines side by side, instead of working on one
---
Until you have multiple accounts, don't VNI rat. And when you do have multiple accounts, use a Myrm instead and be sure to insure it. Running two hubs + insurance will pay for it and everything after that is profit. 
---
Don't scam. It's really bottom feeder level of gameplay and it hurts other newbros.
---
I think you lost track for what you play a game. Fun.
---
Away from all memes and narratives, just on numbers count and fleet capabilities:
---
It still would be manageable if the 733t PvP Faction wasnt that fractioned. If PanFam would still house GotG, be on better terms with skillU and HRE, including FRTs new Titan force and maybe would reach out to groups like Snuff (whose Imp-Alignment was just an opportunistic approach to intense-krab into new titan-Meta) maybe this would be even.
---
But with the diplomatic capabilities of current PanFam lead there is no hope ...
---
You mean instead of holding one together with duct tape and paperclips.
---
If that’s the case, then they have no reason to complain when shit goes pear shaped
---
i, for one, welcome our new rusty overlords
---
Yeah could be i mean if you fuck up continuously and wipe the whole RAID you have gotten -DKP. But well old times. Nothing that will ever come back in this form
---
Would be an idea, however the new T2 Trig ships are worse then their T1 couterparts in the Kikimora and Drekavac. Their low alpha and very long spool will also not make them needed in large quantities for coalitions. So the price will be high in the beginning when people want one asap and then drop like a brick since it's not worth using.
---
Long story short, there will be plenty off supply with very little demand after the novelty has worn off. I give it a month.
---
Its the thrill of stealing a structure in hostile space. Fck easy. ;)
---
I have a shak setup. It's pretty dumb dps. Good isk
---
I'm not sure what relevance anything you just wrote has regarding building a krab fortress vs being nomadic.
---
Literally any alliance in eve online - we surrender
---
Code ganking things that have a small chance to kill them?
---
yes, what you cant see from the KM ( but can find on this guys KB) is they are using nestors for repping. combined with the smartbombers, a small fleet of these can clear sites pretty fast. When you arent dying to rats..
---
Yeah, that's gonna be it :) :)
---
&gt;nc/pl will all be down south, not taking anything but harassing industry

There is no industry going on south besides the dumb fucks who can't read.

It’s not fun to be out formed on every strategic fight and stand down, I also understand the bigger picture, fight and have fun but lose the Corp a crippling amount of isk, or slash and burn to survive an other day, and in the meantime burn goon industry in bombers, not everything in eve has to be meat grinder v meat grinder, and they have more “meat”
---
Who said they were running and not fighting. I don't see why taking down useless assets and station spam means they are running.
---
Also POSs are not a thing kind of they got replaced by player structures that literally are everywhere now. I remember having to go at least 20jumps in null before.seeing a station. Now every system has something....
---
Lol that isn’t right man
---
Unspoken confirmed useless pets, oh what a surprise.
---
No they didnt
---
Test will do as goon overlords command
---
At least a win to Low Sec!
---
Now say that again but without goons
---
How convenient, to rile up the sweaty masses of goons with war rhetoric in prep for CSM voting season.
---
Except you have the backing of a 90k strong alliance...
---
unlimited cloaky camping is just the tip of the penis.
---
Thats funny. NC gives Unspoken so much shit for not being able to defend their space.
---
Unspoken has undocked and fought NC INCREDIBLY OUTNUMBERED on multiple occasions. Has been able to stay relatively even in most fights against them. Yet NC still talks shit.
---
Now there is the threat of a group, that proportionality doesnt come near the disparity in fleet size as Horde + NC + PL vs Unspoken + NSH, and NC instead of giving a fight, is literally unanchoring like a bunch of space CUCK fuckbois.
---
NC and PL are shadows of their former selves, anyone that joins them under the guise of "we are elite" are kidding themselves and essentially throwing plex in the trash.
---
I hate goons, but well done.
---
Sorry if I’m overstepping my boundaries but are you autistic?
---
I resubbed for the million+ SP.  fuck the CSM.
---
Mostly because they had a lot more people to fight with. Now, you'd fight against a greater number of people aswell as titans/supers. It would be stupid.
---
It’s not a question of minority vs majority. CQ would be an additional revenue stream. Think of it as another product line.
---
Period Basis is available for Rental.
---
I love how NC/PL are finally being exposed as having less balls than miners. This was always true yet somehow the narrative stayed on their side.
---
You guys will never actually be evicted, because NC and PL are a paper tiger.
---
NC might actually get evicted, they need someone from Razor Alliance to give them a "what to expect when eviction is happening" talk
---
I'd forgotten how many PLEX sales there were last year, and how it was artificially increasing the supply of PLEX, which would keep the prices down.
---
&gt; So much so that in the last "plex" sale in Mar '19 (need to check date) CCP simply cut the plex of omega from 500 to 475 plex. It was not a monetary cut in price (USD GBP EUR etc).
---
I have to admit I don't actually plex my account, so this had totally passed me by!  That seems like an excellent natural experiment to find out some things CCP is probably trying to keep us from finding out, to do with how many accounts are being plexed.  That also likely explains the extremely anomalous doubling of plex volume for about three days at the end of March.  (Prices went up about 10% when that happened and corrected about a week after volume returned to normal.)
---
I look forward to the rest of your posts. :)
---
B3QP-K Fort is also unanchoring
---
Explain to me how NC. is nomadic at this moment?
---
Inititally I made ISK from station trading (fairly casual, updating max twice per day). Started with about 5 million Isk and eventually made it up to about 5 billion.
---
I still have maxed out orders to generate passive ISK, but a 5-6 hour exploration roam can make 1 billion and is infinately more fun.
---
Yeah, at least DeadCo put up a fight. 
---
Panfam ... just rolled over and handed the keys to the Imperium
---
o7
---
i always wondered what eve would be like if any shot or missile that missed my ship would hit the ship behind me.
---
actually shouldn't all missile explosions be aoe? or is their explosion radius insignificant compared to distances between ships in even a tightly anchored fleet?
---
Pretty much this. 
---
Never underestimate the autism of GoonSwarm. 
---
While everyone loves big fights, most Goons actually don’t hate grinding through people’s stuff, as long as we get the chance to bring out the big toys and a entertainingly overwhelming force.  Grinding away at a undefended Fort with subcaps is kind of dull, but with 3 full Titan fleets and...that is an event you bring popcorn to.  
---
Winning, even when your enemies don’t want to fight, is still a win.  Even more so when you have an engaging narrative that you are riding and you dislike the bad guy.  
---
I expect their moral would have a harder time with this than Goons.
---
Seems counterintuitive for an alliance notoriously known for staying docked to remove their safe spaces to remained docked.  Please fight at your keepstar with your faction supers tia.
---
Man the ships sd’ing on the undock was a sad thing to see even in video
---
yes it must be goon brigading, not you unachoring an entire region.
---
Anotha one
---
where can I get one for my dick?
---
The thing is you wouldn't, let take an example and lets not use Goons for a sec, i know its hard since 99% of "suggestions" are targeted to them. Lets instead take NC/PL, they barely mine today, do you think they would be "nomadic" by this change? Why is that.. 
---
Oh and if you dont want empire building i really think you are playing the wrong game, allot of the "content" is from empire building, if you just want PvP i would think Valkyrie or Battle field of something would be a better choice
---
yes

Also temporary fleet bookmarks.  Expire when the last player leaves fleet.
---
Nah, many alliances have the balls to try and resist, even though they know they odds are crazy, not everyone gives up before the first sign of adversity like NCPL.
---
titans = elephants?
---
I quit EVE about 6mo before walking in stations was a thing, then I came back about 3mo after it was removed. I heard it wasn't great, but I'm really bummed I never got to see it.
---
Really wish I cared more...
---
And compete for rock havens with RA and PLA bots , no thanks.
---
as do the tons of people upvoting him it would seem.
---
That's PanFam's own fault. If they had real leaders they would have learned from WWB and tried to flip the Imperium's allies. That's the only way anyone will be able to stand up to Goon's massive supercap advantage and shake up the current situation in nullsec. 
---
But instead they doubled down. Now they're getting evicted.
---
"Yeah guys, we're allies, we'll fight together and help each other defend"
---
&gt; doesn't help them defend
---
"WHY DID YOU BETRAY US?"
---
not everyone wants to be test with half of eve blue to you. 
---
The 25k in PANFAM is already to many blues
---
And if unfueled, one session to destroy.
---
No, its a reality check for the retards thinking PANFAM would just feed their supers into a vastly superior enemy
---
but but ... who said Goons will go North?
---
yes, spaceship bushido demands it
---
I meant mining it in a WH, got confused with words :)
---
But at least the Ihubs are intact so there are Havens to rat. ;-)
---
We aren’t surrendering. We’re pulling non-critical assets so if/when the hostile super fleet comes through, we can fight the way we want to. On our terms
---
The special sauce for defeating phoenixes consists of the following:
---
 - crucifier
---
 - guidance disruptors
---
 - missile precision disruption scripts. 
---
Just one crucifier cuts the damage application of the phoenix by around 50%. 
---
Get like, 20 newbeans in crucifiers and the Phoenix acts like it's throwing beach balls instead of rocks.
---
*Scotch tape and broken staples
---
It has nothing to do with building a krab fortress it has something to do with having more supers then the other which is the same as years back. You can still act like nobody in ncpl krabs because elite but I am 100% sure everyone has atleast 1 krabbing alt.
---
I would be fine with 2 just like with old POS, initial reinforce and the a final timer. Maximum 48 hrs.
---
pretty sure PLA is in delve or one of our other regions.
---
Try out the dual web merlin next, mse, web web ab, blasters, magstab.  Most of the time they don't realize their not scrambed and die.
---
We both know what you'll do, chestbeat and dock.
---
I understand that standing down isn't fun, so don't stand down permanently? Like a few days back ncpl shot the staging fort of snuff in pb and when snuff undocked 14, I repeat, 14 nightmares ncpl left the field and went home, like wtf?
---
I don't realy care if I lose a ship or a fight or an objective as long as it was fun and fighting is alot of fun. You shouldn't fight when you form 200 people and the other 2000 but it is not like panfam can't form around 700 dudes.
---
Why would you comment any of this to me? All i'm saying is I and many others in NC don't want to live a relatively static spacelife?
---
One? Anomaly spawn per system/constellation -&gt; anomaly spawn per region. Should make resources (isk, minerals) something worth competing for both externally (wars) and internally (culling worthless members), while also helping a bit in T1-T2 price balance (making T2 relatively cheaper).
---
yes clearly we should play worse, so the ncpl clowncar can keep up
---
&gt;  there was a time in this game not so long ago where you could actually go into enemy space and it was fairly risky for them to drop supers on you because competent nomadic alliances had staged counter forces in many places around the game. 
---
Its funny you make this reference, i assume you talking about PL but you seem to forget that PL dident risk anything by deploying their super fleet. Nothing could beat them so they did it with impunity. Now we actually have several groups that can challenge each other.
---
It's alot of fun blowing people up before they realize what happened.
---
Rather nice idea that.
---
Welcome to the game! Set aside your fears - you’re immortal. What do you need help with right now?
---
So thats it for 0.0? No more big wars? THE big thing CCP always talks about and is so proud of? 
---
If this is not enough for CCP to wake up and do some real big changes to shake up 0.0 then EVE is finally truly doomed to be "farming simulator in space".
---
I'm so glad they aren't wasting dev time and energy into this bullshit
---
Yeah, it’s a niche solution to a problem. I just thought it was a cool idea, give cyno a sort of impending doom sensation in a way
---
In an ideal world, sure.  In reality in a company with limited resources to commit to various projects do you work on fluff that requires a whole different engine to maintain and adds nothing to core game play?
---
Also, random people saying, "I'd buy this" is horrible reason to start on most projects.  How many people say they would buy RL EVE gear then nobody buys squat when CCP finally spins up another version of their online store?  We're mostly of shit when we say stuff like that.
---
There are lots of things I would like out of the game, but I'll happily trade a lot of things... logi on kill mails for example, and I almost always fly logi... for fixing some of the broken or out of balance stuff that is currently in the game.
---
I'd love for larger 0.0 entities to use trig ships, mostly because they suck in fleet combat and it'd be free KMs for me.
---
funny how nc/pl being the cowards they always have been is the death of eve every time
---
Yeah, TC was the alliance which shown me that living in null-sec can be fun. 
---
Man what part of my previous sentence was unclear here? I am not arguing about WHY they flipped, simply stating that they did flip. The reasons for them doing so are their own and I genuinely don't care.
---
Less structures to grind is okay by me.  
---
That said, I hope Imperium leadership actually lays the hurt on NCPL.  
---
I don't sub to this game for half-assed play-wars.
---
It just seems like a good idea until Goons move into low sec and then everyone will complain that no one can challenge them there...
---
Ordinarily, I would say "Go join EVE University"... but lately it's taking them a month or so to interview new recruits. So instead I'd say "go join the Eve Uni help chat" and look for another rookie friendly Corp / Alliance with better recruitment.
---
It was honestly kinda cool. At least one part of it. 
---
[You could stand on a balcony and look at your ship](https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/original/416/4161502/2387767-0002.png) while just doing your standard station shit.
---
I've not been tested. 
---
Can you explain your thought process here?
---
Yeah but have u seen what goons can max form
---
For now
---
Hmmmmmmmmm
---
You think so?
---
I think the structures could be more expensive, but the rigs should definitely not be cheaper.
---
Yikes all you want.
---
PanFam going to regret losing Dead Co. (or whatever we're calling them this week) when the South's superfleet shows up.  Horde might have more Titans than they used to but it won't be enough.
---
Diplomacy is the smarter way to play the game.
---
Ban all goons
---
No, they don't. Only meta capital mods have blueprints.
---
And Goons
---
&gt; If winning means building a stationary, impregnable krab fortress then I don't want any part of that! 
---
Because I told you the way to win now is the same as it allways was so you don't have to act like you need to be krab fortess to do it.
---
inb4 goons don't actually deploy to tribute
---
So when you don't turn up to fight with an ally you promised to fight with, in a way, you're kind of... betraying them?
---
Or ya know they betrayed you after that by realising you treated the alliance as worthless beforehand.
---
yea they caused loads of new bros to quit, they did not like it when it when they were in frigs and pl was farming them in supers
---

"1v1 me at the sun irl scrublord"
---
CQ was nothing more than a test bed for their World of Darkness MMO. They went for years without any interest in character models. Our meatsuits are, after all, just a vessel to hold all of our Skill training. The real "characters" in Eve are the ships.
---
But they were trying to make WoD, and they needed a place to test mechanics like clothing and furniture and stuff. Once they scrapped the WoD project, they gave up doing anything for CQ. And b/c it was an extra load on all the servers, they eventually shut it down.
---
But of course, they'll still let you spend PLEX to buy some clothes for your mannequin, before you snap your pilot's license photo. And they want you to feel extra special after 16 years of playing, or grinding hours and hours in Project Discovery. So here's a free ball cap and a t-shirt!

---
Dude, it was just a fun song...
---
I have started this game 15 years ago, it still the same lvl4 missions. you think they are going to create innovative content? keep dreaming...
---
Well we're currently living in Malpais, but what we're doing right now isn't even important. My time in NC has been deploy somewhere for a few months &gt; return home for a few weeks &gt; repeat.
---
Oh right, I only really work with meta cap parts.
---
Any idea why the interview process takes so long?
---
Yep thats how it is, Goons have absolutely no content at all unless there is a war, none at all!
---
Aside from not knowing what this is: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/box7r1/pl\_nc\_are\_starting\_to\_evacuate\_tribute\_vinny\_d/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/box7r1/pl_nc_are_starting_to_evacuate_tribute_vinny_d/)
---
I'm not sure about how fits work and how fighting works. I can do fine against PVE but I've never actually been in a PVP combat situation.
---
I'm also unsure of how ship roles work. I've heard of Force Auxiliaries and Droneboats but I'm not sure what they do.
---
The Grindstone cowboys? :P
---
If I recall correctly from the lore, most ships are used primarily by non-capsuleers, and as such designed to be operated by large crews (one exception being strategic cruisers, which were built from scratch with capsuleers in mind). When you fly them, however, *most* of the need for a crew is eliminated, but not all. So a smaller ship such as a frigate might be operated by you alone, but larger ships still require a skeleton crew for some reason (maybe maintenance?). 
---
Long story short: yes, real lived are lost every time you explode.
---
Yes I have. But will they max form titans for every astra or random citadel? Probably not, for the keepstar? Most likely. I never told ncpls shoudl throw their super fleet into the trashcan, I only said you should't was fun potential by denieing content.
---
There’s a couple C6 backpackers out there, always fun to check zkill and see caps getting roasted jn a shattered 6 by like 5 moroses
---
the issue is most of the people left not in goons, don't want to play that game the reason the north often behaves well so silly from a great narrative standpoint is that most of there player base doesn't want to rorq mine all day, sadly that playstyle isn't viable anymore.
---
Typically happens when a person's account gets hacked. The hacker sells all the assets and buys injectors or plex. They get killed on purpose by their own alt. If stuff drops, a second alt of theirs picks up the loot. This way there is no way to track this back to the real culprit.
---
This guy gets it.
---
I know, I was being a smart ass.
---
Would be great if the just had all the skins for sale at the NES and not one time special.
---
CQ would also be an addition money sink, as developing the engine on side of Eves isn't free.
---
Your brain okay?
---
It already has that as there is necessarily a delay between when the cyno goes up and ships come through.
---
oh so you're just going to immediately give up and unanchor your posts on reddit as well and perhaps flee to the star citizen subreddit?
---
1. Find a wholesale lube dealer.
---
2. Look for buy orders on salt.
---
3. Firesale everything except an insta warp ceptor and your bpo collection.
---
4. Lose your insta warp ceptor and bpo collection to a smart bombing maller on the jita gate in perimeter.
---
something along these lines i think.......
---
Laser Navitas?
---
That's pretty much what the goon sigs and squads do too
---
Huge if verified.
---
Oh ok. So which world war did Germany win again? It's slipping my mind.
---
LUL, this is the BEST timeline.  
---
2016 TEST and Co2 had bigger balls than NCPL.  When faced with the EXACT same situation we stood and fought, while they tuck tail at the first blow of the GoonHorn.  
---
Gotta give it to you Gewnies, that is some powerful propaganda.
---
Lol ok 👌
---
TLDR: The North is too culturally toxic to properly colonize and saturate their space.  
---
So what if you personally don't want to fucking mine.  Absolutely nothing but your culture and leadership prevents Northern alliances from pulling in industrial corps and players to do it for you if your present playerbase isn't interested in PvE.  Horde seem to be the only ones up there that have figured this out.   
---
Not sure if is cowardice or laziness for NCPL.  Rather than try to compete with Goons they just concede the entire economic game to them and then just whine about how their short TTL playstyle from a decade ago pre-Citadels isn't dominant.
---
And back then it was not skill points and cap superiority that was winning, it was the elite personal skills of NC/PL...
---
What? You mean that CCP wouldn't be able to know, what character looted it?
---
Nc+pl+horde vs unspoken+nsh have never been a thing
---
Nc. deployed because liberty squad deployed, there have not been one relevant fight without multiple goon sigs and legacy present
---
"So what if our strategy is obviously flawed and going to fail.  We're going to play the game the way we want to." 
---
Fine, but your bitching and whining will fall on deaf ears.  Play smart or get fucked.
---
Ah
---
Well, but NC+PL feels bad ass bashing people like UnSpoken, JAS, and anothers groups in Drone Regions.
---
It's fun to be the Hammer, but don't like be the Anvil, huh? Jajaja
---
You abuse your number there, but when faced by someone who can stand in front of your numbers, then the megablop argument start to run... I suppose that having a fight with someone who shoots back it's not a NC+PL thing. (Not just UnSpoken, i knew people of a corp of 15 dude being cloaky camped and being evicted right now from a 0.017 system by SkillU + NC guys... 
---
It Will be poetic justice that the corps you are bullying in Etherium Reach move to cool systems un Tribute. XD
---
Anyway, looking how you play badass role with small groups but when goons shows, you start to run Even before seen a imicus in grid, is so sad...
---
Init Hakonen deployment is finally successful.
---
That's clearly rubbish, considering the 'industry first' approach has only been championed for the last few years and citadel spam has made it possible for a group to have vast and almost complete control over a region, moreso than any mechanic that has ever existed.
---
You put less effort into your Reddit posting than you did into leading the Culture and that's a pretty fucking low bar Harvey.
---
Adapt or die.
---
We're talking about company that for over 13 years hasn't been able to create a halfway decent merchandise store. Now THAT is free money.
---
I don't think plastic can stand up to that kind of usage.
---
Yeah absolutely, no arguments. All i'm saying that as a whole, on an alliance level, that is what people seem to enjoy doing and seems to be why some players are attracted to NCPL.
---
That... sucks.
---
"panfam" let goons rebuild and the reason is because the isk dried up for them to do it. It's no ones fault other than panfam that it came to this. Should have ended goo s once they started the rebuild in 1dq, instead they went and got cosy, lazy and stupid.
---
Even just the armor fleet is capable of fighting the north, if shield has to be sent back for home defense.
---
let's not kid ourselves, none of you are gonna vote anyways
---
Being nomadic only works when there aren't space colonies.  
---
That playstyle was always going to be on the clock given that the devs had been talking about ways to do colonization long before it manifested as Citadels.
---
No no, you see they are completely different because reasons.
---
Hire an proactive, knowledgeable and un-fireable balance team.
---
A deployment from your home region =/= to being nomadic. Stop playing dude, if we go by your definition, Goons this week will be nomadic deploying somewhere lmao.
---
Yes, from fear. Legacy is the swing vote but won’t go against goons. Would be interesting if they did though.
---
No one is complaining. Goons are coming North so decisions have been made. None of us really give much of a shit above the sov. We can take some more later on when we want it. NCPL are PvP alliances, we don't have to cater to krabs.
---
Why would i need to RMT? Im rich af irl and jacked to boot. While you're all bashing structures in tribute I will be driving my super model gf to the shore in my ferrari. Cya losers.
---
&gt; CQ was nothing more than a test bed for their World of Darkness MMO. 
---
Did any of that also apply to to Dust? I remember that it had a CQ-like personal lobby too.
---
Yanno, it's funny, Walking in Stations was ended by an uproar over how the main game would essentially not receive any updates for a couple years while they built what was essentially a whole new game inside the game. In retrospect, assuming the whole thing didn't get DUSTed regardless, EVE might've been better off without some of the "developments" that came instead.
---
You can reply just never updoot
---
It's almost as the same thing is happening nc/pl folks are claiming it's smart while GSF/Test are making fun of it now, when GSF did it the roles where reversed.
---
I think his point was to show that running EVE on AWS is a bad idea and you can refer anyone to this thread if they come to you foaming from their mouth telling how awesome the cloud is for gaming.
---
Sad how much I would enjoy this, same time I like buffed AF's bar the ramjag.
---
To he fair, if you throw 20 newbeans in a disruption/tracking/optimal fit in any dreads, you'll render them useless.
---
Yes, with nestor logi and sometimes those guys bring a naglfar
---
All I can think about are all the structure rigs. 
---
All that precious salvage, gone, like tears in rain.
---
You have a crew. http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=New_Eden_Crew_Guidelines
---
But as a capsuleer, your crew requirements go down drastically.
---
As far as paying them, I remember something about the ISK to planetary currency exchange being high enough that their lifetime salaries are a part of the ship when we buy/produce them.
---
I'm not sure that is something you should be proud of.
---
THE SPOD MUST FLOW!
---
I probably put more effort in one week, into leading The Culture, than you’ll ever be capable of. So, in the words of another good leader ‘eat my ass’.
---
there havent even been an announcement yet lmao
---
Cool!
---
Righto, we spent 2018 in Syndicate &gt; Provi &gt; Khanid &gt; Curse.
---
Ain't that the truth.
---
Consider how things were after we moved out of the north: opinion of my bloc was at an all-time low, and so was our membership. The smart move would have been to take that momentum and parlay it into a vassal state to do all the economic crap that the upper caste couldn't be bothered to do. Instead, they scared off the most impressionable and pliable source of such members (TEST) so... a dozen or less folks in a good ol' boys club could anchor industry structures in jump range of Jita.
---
When you refuse to play the meta that's kinda what happens.
---
Yeah so we've pushed everyone to have multiple supers. Deploy with half, leave the other half home. Industry and ratting have been told to throttle down, but there will probably be smoothbrains that still get caught. Good luck bashing structures and sov though with the umbrella still up
---
I'm amazed people are still proud the turned the game into farmville. 
---
The reality is the dead of the barbarian hordes is the dead of most of the game play.
---
Absolutely agree that it's been made harder over the years, i'm just offering a response to the dudes saying "I hope the north settles in a region and gets their industry rolling."
---
But for pamfam has fun in out form little groups in drone regions huh?
---
What's up. It's not fun fight someone who shoots back? XD
---
That is so cool
---
Lol. Third party, good1
---
Why do people think that they, personally, have to rorq mine?
---
Since you refuse to answer my question. Yes. Can 't fight a blob (of responses without an actual answer)
---
Depends on why you’re interdicting them. 
---
If you’re camping a gate and a bubble you want a drag rather than a stop; people will get dragged on the far side of a stop making your tackle/dictors cover more ground. 
---
If you’re not interested in camping the gate a stop will work just as fine and is easier to set up.
---
If you’re interdicting a fleet a stop is quicker to set up and forces the fleet to burn through the bubble.
---
Lmao, so you went on deployments but still have home staging and sov, right? So nomadic of you.
---
I can tell you which world war France lost if you prefer?
---
What if Grath and other guys quitting after last summers fiasco meant they care nothing to play the summer war (can't give a crap to give contents) 
---
or maybe that 150(?) core pilots (that I remember mentioned from some old interview vs several hundred that people think) are maybe not there enough now.
---
Honestly though, after last summers DDos, why give contents to those who will not play the contents? They could pretend they will then try to blueballs, but why not blueballs it all from the get go and just... withdraw? Just say no to the lie of contents for Goons to DDos
---
Could also be WoW incoming stuffs competing in summer activity
---
Right so you're either a retard or a troll either way I think we're done here.
---
Not only is this a terrible maller video. You don't even really showcase anything ecm related.
---
Being on them at the mittanis waist definitely takes a toll.
---
We've gone from "lmao home region =/= being nomadic" to "lmao yeah you left home but kept staging". You wanna move the goalposts anymore? You want us to unanchor keepstars every time we leave and bring them with us?
---
It depends if you setup structure timers absolutely, people will ask there friends to help, if your just baiting with a ship very unlikely sure you get that 80 man fleet truth a frig hole things occasionally but it's a rarity and generally only done because caps are expected on the other side most of the big entities are careful not to ruin there own content because most of the time the brawls happen because both sides opt in, so if you have to deal with the same dudes blobbing you stop giving them fights.
---
You're wrong grouping CO2 with those other alliances.
---
This is such a stupid argument
---
A lot of us in my Corp were excited for the war, not only to go around killing shit but we wanted a lot of capitals and titans to die on both sides to get rid of some in the game
---
well, you're fucking wrong, lmao
---
Fighting goons on the campaign trail is inherently unfun as they have enough people to guarantee tidi.
---
The same statement can be said about the entirety of the game
---
Ultimate disrespect for Imperium after last summer... blueballs the  whole summer war contents. Just say nah, have the server Serentity, Asset safety forever; And goodbye Eve. 
---
BLUE BALLS ETERNAL :P
---
PLA Associates is the largest Corp in PBLRD. I can’t think of any reason why the largest Chinese Corp within goons would create another Corp and put it into the goon renter program.
---
In ww1 yeah, I don't think France was on the same playing field in ww2
---
Anyone who's ever been in a "large battle" must remember what a horrible experience it actually is.
---
yeh I here ya man I prefer the dual web armour one but that fit is nasty also :)
---
well, i'm not, lmao
---
I think the answer to that is probably yes if you think about pure numbers owned, but that's not the same as deployed and in fleet for a mid-week all night TIDI-fest.  Shield was brought up from Delve for the big timers last summer wasn't it.  
---
I've never seen the entire coalition deployed, which is why this weekend is going to be exciting, even if there's no fighting - at least for screenshots!
---
You will never see PANFAM and imperium supers pinned against eachother with the numbers today. Maybe if legacy joined PANFAM but thats not likely to happen
---
Yeah and vily had his leash tugged for being disobedient.
---
AFAIK, there is no real info on how the T2 materials will enter the game.
---
They exist on the test server, but there are no blueprints for them.
---
Yeah shield was brought up to reinforce the armor fleet.
---
Wish my rig didn't melt outside potato mode :P
---
Test is still having wars with Frat, and stainwagon , whats left it is acting up again. So i doubt test  + Legacy is going north anytime soon . Mostl  likely just the imperium for now
---
Lol man you guys have it up your asses with your smug superiority complexes.
---
Goons are shit though. Surely someone can put together a game plan of resistance. You can cyno jam a system for at least 90min. That's a massive obstacle to overcome if the defending force is competent
---
Oh for fuck's sake I didn't even get to record one fucking dispatch.
---
I think many of their older members got too used to the passive income from opressing most of New Eden for years by holding most of the good moons and having the biggest super fleet.
---
They seriously need to pull their krab alts out of all those shitty renter groups and consolidate in a region under a new "lets chill with the elitism" motto.
---
Goons need to get some DDossers again, but they will not get the chance if PL just moves to sec, stows their stuff and retires. Comeback after being bored of WoW Classic to say hello like Elo flush with coke and hookers, LEErrrrooyyy JJJEEnnkkkinnnsss!!
---
XD could just be funny disinformation too, but still epically funny; Blue balls the whole summer war after last years fiasco.
---
&gt; not everyone wants to be test with half of eve blue to you.
---
Except when they do exactly that, like this time last year. But hey, it's only bad when the other guys do it, amirite?
---
People like to forget liberty deployed AFTER NC. came to malp. But then again why speak the truth when you can spin everything to your favor?
---
Exactly!
---
Why would they after past greviences . NCPL conspired with Frat to wipe legacy out. Ended   with stalemate with frat and co . While ncpl withdrew for the good fights of picking on dead coalition. THe diplo decisions of NCPL have shattered any northern alliance. They need to rebuild bridges  with  drone regions and Dead coalition of they want to hit the goons
---
We use ECM throughout the whole video, as all of our DPS was fit with them - It didn't play a huge part in the fights as they were very skirmishy, but I can't force people to fight me in big fleets that shows off how the mechanics work.
---
Is 15W-GC your staging? I doubt it. Honestly, I think you are being way to try hard at this. The thing is this, you claimed that NC. is nomadic while they have a staging in their own space most of the time unless they are on deployment (just like every other group in this game). You claimed those deployments as being nomadic which is ridiculous, and if you want to follow that insane logic, Goons are nomadic due to their SIGS, but go ahead with the goalpost thing though, I hear it's very popular on reddit.
---
they didn't though. it was literally a response to liberty squad.
---
Before that we used jump gates, its only 7 jumps so its not that big a difference but still
---
And you are all stuck on that narrative. Did you see the battle report?  Did you even play the game then?  I can guarantee you we fought for them, we just couldn't match the 2000+ that showed up in m-o.
---
The ships are often INSIDE each other in large fleets, so the explosion radius would matter. But I guess we've got bombs for aoe damage and the 16 year old code can't be changed that easily and we won't get something like this. Calculating missing shots would be even worse, we don't even have ship hitboxes. Would be interesting though.
---
Been in this meta years now, not mined or built something once, still got filthy rich.
---
It's just an excuse for bad players to feel better about the fact super superiority is no longer covering their obvious failings.
---
But they did. I've been here this entire time. They literally come to kill us because we killed a sotiyo, not because goons deployed. The last couple NC posts on reddit have not really displayed the true picture of the war out here. They've lost a lot more than any of us have. Like seriously, look at all the B0T Structures that have died during the war. Ratting is down immensely in malp and spire. Without the back-up of phorde supercaps this would have been a losing war. Even with said supers,  we still have plenty of forts left. Even if you could give them the benefit of the doubt on everthing, the fact we still remain is a testament to how bad they have become.
---
except they were
---
To late it's gone. However I am off to a new home.

You shouldn't have made a big blue donut with Dronelands and Winter Co. You own more than half the regions with your buddies. You blued up almost every single major coalition in New Eden to try to evict Test. You interfered in Legacy vs Winter Co 1v1. And now you still bitch about your enemies also fighting you together.
---
Goon SIGs are 100% nomadic. NC as an alliance is nomadic because when we deploy, the entire alliance deploys. There aren't any krab fleets or activities in Tribute when we deploy, save for stopping people fucking with structures. How is this the hill you've chosen to die on, when like 99% of Goons would agree that NCPL have lived a relatively nomadic life forever?
---
All those upgrades to my audio hardware too. Rip.
---
Incursions were partially supposed to be a nullsec group pve but only mattered there due to the cynojamming. 
---
Highsec incursions were also one of the major reasons wormholes went downhill fast
---
I'm not saying that at all - but up until that point there were a LOT of structures that got burned. For every keepstar killed there were a ton of other citadels burned by line members just because they could. Many citadels died not because of a stratop - but because some autistic member said "well fuck it, I can kill that" entirely on their own.
---
This is the best comment Ive read all week
---
"Paps" used to monitor strategic participation.
---
Even someone as dumb as you must have heard of them.
---
A neat artifact... wonder where you scanned that down ;)
---
Relevant is arguable because most people only see fights as relevant if theres hundreds of people or a lot of isk lost, but Unspoken doesnt have hundreds of people and isnt going to fight hundreds alone because thats literally suicide. There have been multiple important fights though of us vs NC. without goons.
---
https://br.inyour.space/?s=2355&amp;b=8400960&amp;e=270&amp;t=Hn this was our first fight back in December over our LXQ fortizar. We put up a bait cyno beacon so NC. came to kill it. goons werent helping us at the time but came into system to see the fight. they ended up grabbing one of our rattlesnakes and killing it with bombers.
---
https://br.inyour.space/?s=2349&amp;b=8588160&amp;e=210&amp;t=bq This was a fight over our fortizar. There was one goon there multiboxing bombers, NC. had a lot more eagles but they didnt kill anything so the report is missing them. They left because we killed all their booshers.
---
https://br.inyour.space/?s=2381&amp;b=8589480&amp;e=210&amp;t=rq this was us defending a friendly fort. no goons.
---
https://br.inyour.space/?s=2369&amp;b=8606880&amp;e=210&amp;t=feae This is us fighting over one of our forts armor timers the other night. We didnt stop the fort or other structures in system from being reffed but we took the outnumbered fight still and did okay.
---
Theres probably more smaller fights but those are all I can remember.
---
Then split off your own Corp to a fresh non-blue alliance and walk the line you talk?
---
theres not really room for that in the current meta. Sure i could, but that would also mean leaving all the people i enjoy playing with
---
If this was 2010, yes.
---

lol as if people aren't already running their rorqs while on fleets anyway, Nice try
---
+1 underrated.

well, you are, lmao
---
Lol
---
Wherever that cancer goes is not a win..
---
Bought a PLEX 6-pack with irl dollars during a rare sale and sold them, paid my sub for many months just flipping them after that start-up injection.  I've recently fired up again and found out that they're now a currency though and I'm not sure how to interact with them anymore and whether that's worthwhile.  At the time the "free" money let me not think about ISK and instead I got to spend my time having fun.
---
Ah yeah, because smallganging PIBC and the Russians in USTZ is so likely to result in content. Gang fights with goons happen (they go predictably)
---
Resetting BRAVE would be like... a bit of content, but it would also be like kicking puppies with the past relationship between the two alliances.
---
Yea goons totally helped us stomp you in Provi, or in Catch, or any of the other failed southern deployments you have had. Yup totally the goons bailing us out every time.  Put down the Kool-Aid champ, PanFam is obsolete and a relic of the past.   
---
The best part is, they forced this situation and continue to throw a tantrum because of it. When did you expect to happen when you blob supers on anything that moves for YEARS? Every to just sit and keep taking it?  You got what you asked for, and its a bitter pill to swallow.
---
It’s more of a defensive sov conversation than any kind of joint offensive sov campaign.
---
The experience this spring should serve plenty of notice that imperium and test/legacy aren’t joined at the hip the way they were 12-18 months ago.
---
Uh... we moved to Saranen from D2 in early February.  Citadels were end of April. So, sure, pre-citadel, but that's a pretty wonky association.
---
TAPI were Goons pets in the past, before becoming PL pets.
---
Now Goon pets again, maybe the cycle will complete.
---
So about tree fiddy then?
---
yeah but you are, lmao
---
You posts are true to your username.

THE SPOD IS VITAL, TO SPACE AUTISM

Grath isn't in PL???
---
Hopefully teiricide brings blueprints for meta mods as well. Chances of this? Low.
---
Remind me about that Oijanen offensive test had a few months ago, also thanks for the share of perimeter isk. guess u can’t do anything with our goons bailing you out
---
Yup, can't take the heat get out of the kitchen.
---
Funny that they spent years doing this shit to people, but when the tables are turned they just quit cause they can't take it.
---
hmm unachoring citadel you say.. 
---
/me moves some alts in range
---
We'll find a use for minitru soon enough, don't you worry
---
You just peell the couple a Hundo black legion outta FRT.  FRT proper isn’t doing shit except continuing their arms race to be sure they can meet the mango threat to come.  Last thing FRT wants is to see their advantage pissed away defending panfam sov.
---
They can run but they can't hide....
---
Yea, do we think NC/PL will do anything different from what they did yesterday though? Maybe, time will tell i guess. I hope they have a plan
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
breaking: CCP to finally iterate on a feature
---
It's not good for the game is it really.  Tranq is starting to have a Serenity feel about it.  There's a too-big group in nullsec and nobody wants to fight them.  Goons should voluntarily shrink - kick Initiative and their shit "elite pvp" from Fountain, triple PAP requirements so it's 3 per month rather than 3 per quarter to weed out the high-sec pubbies, etc.
---
I mean sure, I suppose people will be fine with ratting and mining in Delve for the next 5 years until absolutely everybody in the game has a Titan, at which point the servers get turned off because nobody wants to lose it.
---
Oh god, my morale is already falling.  NC-PL's cunning psychological warfare plan is working...!
---
*The prophecy is fulfilled*
---
oh. i didn't know that. interesting.
---
yea they can
---
&gt;we don't have to cater to krabs
---
Your time in the North would disagree with you. Your fleeing meat shield in GotG would disagree with you. Brothers of Tangra would disagree with you.
---
i just think it would be funny if we deployed to liek dronelands or something
---
pretty sure you are though, lmao
---
Sell it to the far superior company, EA.
---
Someone just figured out an answer to ratting bots 😂 make the bounties an item in the wreck that you need to loot.
---
ACL managed bookmark sets
---
Nope. DUST was running an FPS system completely independent from Eve. The only cross over was Local chat and sync for the Orbital Strikes.
---
Because they don't have enough interviewers on during the week. They do 2-3 over the weekend, but that's about it.
---
Unfueled towers didn't have any reinforcement cycles so you could kill them in one session
---
Have any groups tested this?
---
It would be a shame for your legacy to be bluing the only group larger than yours.
---
this tuz guy really is cringe beeposting hard in this thread
---
Multi-threading
---
This rivalry has been over for a long time now.  NC/PL is a shadow of its former self, and they know it.  Most of the people who were the major drivers have grown up and moved on.  Lots of good memories, but life goes on.
---
I think some people would like to think that these old rivalries still exist for nostalgic reasons or to give themselves a reason to still log in, but they don't.  All that grinding that Goons are doing is for nothing, really, other than the ego pump that you get from seeing big numbers in your bank account.  The days when it actually mattered because you were trying to build a war machine are long past.
---
The people who are out there grinding away in Rorquals and supers now are doing it simply because they like to.  It doesn't have much of a point other than that.  Nothing wrong with that, and Goons have done a great job recruiting people who like to do it.  Enjoy.
---
That's what blue loot is in wormhole pve.
---
The skins needed some sort of badge decal.
---
It's not that people personally have to rorq mine but well the rorq miners have to come from somewhere, now to get more people you either have to convert the existing people or get new people, now new people is hard because honestly it's unlikely your the best choice for a completely neutral person as well you have less supers / titans then the biggest group, existing folks if there anything like me would drop corp on the spot.
---
(edit to be fair i don't fly titans either because my policy of SDing when i see tidi makes this really expensive )
---
What's wrong with incursions? I like them.
---
Inb4 reee you aren't playing the game the way I want it to be played.
---
+1
---
Not just UnSpoken, they are messing with corps of -20 guys, trashtalking in local, to kick them from a -0.017 in Dronelands.
---
Thing is, fighting someone who shoots back, it's not a NC or PL thing. XD
---
I hope for a big Coalition of small groups to fight back big guys. But in this case, Goons is just serving poetic justice yo NC+PanFam. O7 goons.
---
Plot twist. Small corps bullyed for PL and NC, get rich moving to Tribute. LMAO
---
Exactly, just make blue loot how it works in general.
---
yeah you right, we had an "Nostalgia Op" last week, killing 2 offline Towers and their Mods in under 20 Minutes ...
---
Idk, maybe to be strong independent coalition?
---
It is more a family realy. I can't count through how many ups and downs I went with people I never met IRL and how many of those did the same for me. I wouldn't miss this for anything.
---
Thanks! :D
---
P3 Still stands, and we burned your shit out. I'd say that went well.   
---
Oijanen (and all our Northern deployments for that part) was half-hearted at best.  I honestly think it was HC testing to see what our active armor fleet numbers looked like.  Alas I'm am but a lowly line member and don't know what their end-game was, but I still got to blow stuff up and that's all that matters to me.   
---
P.S. You need to level Reddit to at least 4 NewBean.
---
welcome to blueball online
---
I really really wanted Legion. I want One Universe, One War. This seems like a no brainer to expanding and retaining the new player base.
---
If you honestly think that all of those characters were involved, you're drinking that good kool-aid.
---
&gt; like tears in rain
---
"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe."
---
Or they just happened to have a higher density of people who used their limited time to log in for pvp rather than pve.
---
Please don't say the R-Word it is Offensive to many in our community.
---
*Ark, not arc.
---
Why not just blueing goons :P boom problem solved ...
---
How so? Sov is useful, it makes money. But it doesn't define us as an alliance. Horde to a certain extent need sov, as do GOTG, both of them cater to newer/more casual players. NCPL don't have to worry about that, our members will keep logging in as long as there is PvP to participate in. Anyone who leaves because we lack krab space for a few months isn't someone we really want anyway.
---
NC has been really struggling without your military prowess.
---
That line works just as well today, you know. Are you sure you want to use it?
---
You burned our shit out so much u pay us a market share of your station, “was half-hearted” yeah your Corp leadership didn’t agree on that
---
Aeon? When i look first time the Drekavac i remembered the Seraphim's experimental ship. Later i found a pic of it and... well, it remembers me a Dreka xD (many time without playing SC btw)
---
Vily and progod made a Coalition with Tapi at its centre, they openly copied the goon business model, they adapted to the krab empire meta and have flourished, they blued goons rather than possibly lose it all. Seems pretty well tested. 
---
My personal legacy is destroying my own alliance rather than having to join a coalition to insure its survival. Don’t believe reddit flairs sir.
---
&gt;My time in NC has been deploy somewhere for a few months &gt; return home for a few weeks &gt; repeat.
---
So basically the same thing Test and Goons do.
---
The Saranen move was nearly 2 months before citadels.  Idk where this weird narrative is coming from.
---
How could I make a fart joke on this?
---
Let me get his straight without the first ship moving to staging NC is already packing their shit up and moving out... God we do alot of damage threatening to do something imagine what happens when we actually deploy... first blood is drawn by NC shooting their own foot
---
Also goons win the first what 90 timers? Without even leaving delve.
---
The amount of actual characters, not to mention players, that CFC et al can stick on the field is atleast 4-5x what PL+NC. can.
---
The numerical advantage back when Deklein was purged was 2x at most.
---
My how the chips have changed now that the RMT'ing unlimited funds casinos are gone. I wonder who could have predicted all this? Building your castle on shifting sands doesn't seem like a bright idea, now, does it? What do I know, I only have posts predicting this exact shit happening even before GSF was evicted from the north.
---
Are they really though? There’s over 500 C5 holes, I don’t think there are even 500 WH groups out there and not all of them live in C5’s.
---
Look at the Rage eviction, there were a lot of groups rage(lol) rolling their C5 static’s to try to get to Rage and were unsuccessful. There’s definitely at least a few empty C5s out there.
---
Remember, the Talking in Stations - Test Pilots - episode from a ayear ago?
---
T2 and T1 rigs typically cost more than the structure hulls themselves.
---
oouucchhhh
---
Make the Vexor derpy smile boat again CCPLZ! #literallyunplayable
---
10/10 thanks for sharing
---
NCPL would be best off going to lowsec, becoming another Snuff. Leave null to the mega coalitions that enjoy large scale pvp.
---
there will be wars but just not with the cfc.
---
Ha, your first mistake was thinking goons stop mining while shooting structures.
---
Oh you care for it, you just can't live with the fact you're shit at it now!
---
Ever shit post so hard that NC. evacuated?
---
and you think every one of the 16k imperium characters were fighting?
---
ITT people falling for this tasty bait post
---
I was trying to be punny, maybe not too obvious.
---
Though your answer makes it even more obvious what I was inferring.
---
&gt; Goons still have to move their super capital fleet
---
Actually, they don't.
---
It wouldn't be uncharacteristic for Goons to meta-game.
---
Example:  "We're deploying North to NC. space!"  Watch all the chaos that ensues, capitalizing on the hasty retreat (scooping, easy kills, etc.), and laughing all the way to zkillboard, and not actually invading, maybe just send a few sigs.
---
NCPL have always been massive hypocrites about blobbing and pretending they don't do it.
---
So what, it was just dumb luck that the Wehrmacht steamrolled the French in a matter of weeks?
---
Hey umm, so instead of clicking a bunch of times to broadcast a primary just “ X” and click.
---
Saves a lot of time
---
With attacking high sec corps enmasse through alts, who can Goons attack that is bigger?
---
No that's not the case at all. NCPL are running from a fight, there's nothing CCP can do to change that. Not all alliances are that weak minded, Frat, Test, Goons, Horde will still clash.
---
Think of it as the little guys getting out of the way so the real pvp'ers can fight
---
When I checked a few days ago there was one Corp that had been in B0T before joining PBLRD, a small one but I can’t remember the size off the top of my head. 
---
So Sadus was basically bullshitting when he said on TiS that the 600 botters banned came from ncdot renters, and got reported because of ‘goons revolutionary new renter model’.
---
Oh I'm sure some guys are loaded. Eve is littered with people who don't PVE or anything. But there are a lot of "new" elite who don't have those warchests.
---
I don´t know, just rip one out.
---
I guess being \~elite pvpers\~ can only carry you so far. Sometimes you have to be a social butterfly, too.
---
I live in Fountain dude, I don't want to go to the Dronelands haha.
---
In every single deployment to NC space, NC has historically deployed away from the action. Don't see why anyone is shocked
---
But reddit is my home...
---
Fc , what do ?
---
There's not much content left in lowsec and the bit that is left would be totally suffocated by our presence.
---
&gt;Also goons win the first what 90 timers? Without even leaving delve.
---
It is a huge timesaver. no denying it.
---
Hey, PL, move to Syndicate. That's what we did in similar circumstances, and we had the best year of INIT's existence. You won't get rich. You won't get to pubstomp or dickswing. You won't have it easy.
---
But you might have fun.
---
imagine being in a cuck alliance that runs from the nasty Goon Bull when it comes to dick their space
---
The beep-boops would just query the corp of said officer. However I still like this idea. It's more creative than "Remuhv loculz CCPLZ!!11!1"
---
&gt; third-party
---
You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.
---
It is known
---
It's almost as if the golden age of exclusive elite pvp sovholder alliances and treating your allies like slaves is coming to an end.
---
Are you seriously arguing that in a game about shooting internet spaceships signing internet diplomatic agreements *not* to shoot internet spaceships is somehow a sign of grand victory? Why even play in the first place then?
---
There are no reasonable changes to be made, as in ccp developed themself into a corner where they can move out.
---
theyre not. there are a fuckton of empty c5s or c5s with small structures to sell/low power ones. in which noone cares if they get shot.
---
sorry there’s a lot of stupid around, clearly myself included.
---
Damn, you've reached the bargaining stage this quickly?
---
are you active again?
---
they are as occupied as null space...
---
Have you tried the new OP as fuck cyno jammers?
---
That's just muscle memory - The broadcast keys used to be buggy as fuck, especially under any amount of lag pre-TiDi, whereas the right-click menu almost always worked. Good tip for people learning the craft now though!
---
&gt; make the bounties an item in the wreck that you need to loot
---
Maybe CCP can add drone metals to Rogue Drones!
---
You act like it's an agreement to not shoot ANY internet spaceships.  
---
It's not - it's an agreement to focus your fire on those with incompatible / conflicting interests.
---
Ah, still I’ve been using it even in some pretty bad 10% tidi and it seems to be alright
---
This is not the narrative, back then they won with superior player skills! :)
---
So don't take any tidi fest keepstar battles then?
---
Just a thought.
---
lmao but seriously, you are very wrong, and look not so smart.
---
When do you think we ran to lowsec?
---
Interesting: you could eliminate the automatic bounty payout, and replace it with a "tag" system.... essentially something in between clone tags/insignia &amp; blue loot.   
---
You have to physically scoop the tag and can turn them in just about anywhere in order to actually "collect" your bounty rather than being paid on your tic.
---
So when the war is won, should we have a miner II and t1 fighter solidarity month? Just to let NCPL catch up.
---
Eve needs more space. Probably 3-4 times more then current with narrow corridors out to those areas. The universe is too small. There is no "getting away" from the current mega coalition to build. Eve needs a real expansion. We've been fighting over the same shit for a decade.
---
If you build it they will come.
---
2x? 60k / 16k ~= 4x.
---
I swear I remember seeing a demo of an Eve game where you explored the station FPS-style.  Something about entering a high-radiation area to complete an objective.
---
Yes, they will really show us by losing the entire region and trillions of isk, wow they sure trolled us.
---
There are clearly at least 4 Leshaks
---
Are you flying talwars in your hype vid ?
---
Everything
---
Yeah, the framework already exists for this as well, the ESS system.
---
The story of the big bad wolf, sponsored by UHaul.
---
"For when you need to move on a moment's notice"
---
I could see /u/srgafo being an EVE player.
---
Invaders never had anywhere close to 60k people.
---
You say you dipped to 16k at worst.
---
I'm talking about ability to put people on field, not about what an imaginary coalition has in characters.
---
Nice video with lovely commentary as usual; thanks for sharing! ♡
---
I really don't understand what you expect here. Life goes on. No one expects us to be able to face off Goons+TAPI in a fair fight and no one in PL is gonna get upset and blame our FCs/each other/etc.
---
PL will as per usual just go and do something that looks like it might work.
---
That's why I usually escorted mining operations with a cloaking sniper. As soon as they rolled up, I uncloaked, shot anyone of them and cloaked back up. Miners warped out, response fleet warped in and out.
---
Get creative in dealing with them...
---
Do I know you?
---
Don't forget shitposting on /r/eve about grr goons
---
That's a core mindset of NCPL
---
If we're talking about people on field, the MBC regularly outformed us by 10x or more. Not sure you want to go this route either.
---
It is easiest to rattle, but the leshaks run the sites faster and not running the drifter is leaving 300 mill on feild.
---
not sure why you keep talking about yourself in third person
---
~~black rubber pod skin ccplz~~
---
Meant to post that on someone's reply above
---
Why wouldn't the current coalitions take that space as well for ratting? If you spend any time flying through null, once you get past the bottlenecks, dead end systems and major hubs there's vast areas of empty space already. 
---
If what we already have isn't used, why would more empty space change that?
---
Yeah it's entirely fine now - I started FCing in 2010 so things were weird back then. I am *just about* old enough to remember black screens on jumping in. Habits like that are hard to break, but I'll have to try and learn it, if only to be a good example in these videos!
---
Honestly, I think Aryth did it to make himself more wealthy and used burnout as an excuse.
---
I don't understand why they don't just implement something like the warden program blizzard uses. Botting still exists but it's nowhere near as rampant as in eve.
---
It's almost as if you don't actually understand how those alliances operate. Shitty renter groups are exactly that. They are not groups who want to contribute, they are there to krab as much as they can endure, and be left alone to do so.
---
Not everyone enjoys the mindnumbing pve in this game which is at the core of two of the largest coalitions in the game.
---
There is almost no point even having allies in the traditional sense anymore the way the game is played. Alliances are basically sigs, with sigs bigger than most alliances.
---
Never had the to deal with star-base management but I thought if they had stront they would still have a reinforcement cycle. Which is was why wormhole corps would place a tower +stront on every moon to slow down an eviction.
---
The dread is only to kill the drifter once it warps off. The avengers make it not worth to mix subs and caps.
---
when will CCP realize that good pve can't and doesn't exist in eve online, and that the interaction of PvE and PvP content is king?
---
Poor Aze &lt;3
---
Heheh yeah I started in 2011, I Denver back when you need to have 200 Au safe to bridge your fleet in cos you need 20 mins to load grid
---
waht 600 botters?
---
I'm talking about the ability to put people on field.
---
And show me one instance where MBC ever fielded 20k people. CFC on a bad day with ragepings would be able to field 2k no sweat.
---
1k CFC pilots is a slow day, show me even one case of 10k MBC.
---
I mean, we're not going anywhere and we will still fight you if you come. Just without the bad calls you made during WWB.
---
So what you are saying is,"Imperium has a big dick and will swing it."
---
I hear there's some lovely space in Period Basis for rent for low low rates. You don't even have to bring your structures with you.
---
Answer the question.
---
edit: killboard says "eh kinda".
---
the fob rats used to shoot random things on grid, and we'd bump freighters and hold them as the rats shot and slowly killed them
---
one of CODE's bumpers autistically killed a couple dozen freighters this way @Siegfried_Cohenberg
---
Aryth, probably the richest man in goons, did it for isk ? No sir, Aryth did it for his ego.
---
We never fielded 2,000 or even 1,000 people after MO-.
---
what i'm saying is eve 2019 is boring and CCP have absolutely done changes that will lead to it dying somewhere in the next 10 years if they don't make changes.
---
\#eveisdying
---
Maybe his idk is his ego
---
The ones named and shamed in chapter one of CCP Peligro’s botting statistics disclosures.
---
Though not specific to Python, using a C++ core that implements functionality added via other scripting languages is *extremely* common in most game engines created in the last 20 years.
---
You will lose some performance when doing so, but can be worth the tradeoff since scripting knowledge is usually more widespread than people who **really** know what they're doing with C++.
---
I'll just [leave](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bo6h6v/the_upcoming_war_of_goonswarm_against_the_botting/enczsem/) [these](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bng9zi/imperium_fireside_confirmes_invasion_delayed_by_1/en68x03/) [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bn0b81/imperium_fireside_spoilers_invasion_plans_leaked/en1wk27/)
---
Pretty much the. 
---
Eve is the game that it is, not necessarily the game that you may want and certainly not the one it was 10 years ago.  
---
If you want to be competitive, you have to embrace the current meta that is actually proven to be competitive, even if it means changing your play style.  
---
While it’s ok to play the old meta if that’s what you like (it’s a sandbox after all) you really can’t complain when you are relegated to a minor player that has to find lots of friends or stay under the big groups radar out of fear of getting run over.
---
Wont work if the Imperium really tries.
---
Most credit card processing contracts wouldn't allow that.
---
Generally can't use a CC number as a tracking ID, and information required to type it in is generally not allowed.   Also one of the reasons why a lot of pizza delievery sites don't have a "Same billing address as delivery address" button.
---
No, we're not getting space panda monks.
---
not true, i just am a min pilot, every time i get decloaked there is no time to lock me before warp. more agile ships often dont need the full cycled to get up to speed, you just gotta watch for the decloak and be johnny on the spot with warp. been doing to for years and years.
---
Because you can only spread out/protect your pets so far. There is 0 space in EVE for up and coming corps that evolve into alliances. It's ALL very easily and quickly within reach of the powers that be. Anywhere in eve currently can be hit by the sole mega coalition in 24h. I'm talking about expansions on all sides of the current eve uni and far out, 3-4 times more then the current available space, and much further away from empire, further away then most like, forcing people to be nearly entirely reliant on themselves or making it much, much more expensive to ship to/from empire.

They probably never saw a reason to write lore for it. The ship plugs into mains power so naturally the energy shield would recharge, but the armor and hull, being physical, wouldn't.
---
There are no money moons to fight over in syndicate anymore though :(
---
Cheers jaylus its appreciated :)
---
I never played to much sov warfare, was always on the receiving end of losing (provi invasion 5+ years ago), but I think if they took SBUs, changed the HP to be based on the sov index that is in place now, it would be fine. That way you get rewarded for using your space but dont have to fly and pretend your Harry Potter.
---
not a likely scenario. true that once in a while there are situations where you are un-lucky enough to have an object in decloak range. this can be further reduced by ensuring you wait the whole cloak timer to try to let moving objects move off. a good example of worst case scenario is hed-gp gate in sv5, many times there is a drone sphere, and even at full density i only find 1 out of 5 jumps spawn me in a spot i cant cloak (cloki). highsec gate are generally much safer than that xD
---
Ohai! Thanks for the ping. :D
---
I had a multiboxed setup with 3 tinker rattles, 1 passive rattle, 6 polarized bombers and a salvager setup that made 1.5b/hr in C5s. Did a site with the tinkers, and simultaneously did the drifter from previous site with the passive Rattle and bombers.
---
I don't think I could have made better ISK/hr with 10 leshaks solely due to the targeting work needed.
---
Because the game would improve if this happened.... smdh
---
True.
---
Ccp left so much cash on the table. Aura voice packs alone would have made them a fortune.
---
But people are not saying Drifter Incursions, they are referencing the Sansha Incursions. Which is dumb, like the duder above is saying, because they are actually one of the active things in the game...
---
UnSpoken, JAS, and the rest of the guys facing NC and PanFam. Has earned the respec of a lot of people. Sadly, eveytime we saw eachother we shoot. But i would don't mind in future fly with any of you guys. 07
---
You can keep blaming rorquals and super ratting all you want, the reality is that alliances like PL and NC have had the same (if not better) access to ISK and mineral generation before GSF even became as powerful as it is now. PL as a 2000 man alliance absolutely dwarfed any other alliance in the game in super numbers 6 years ago. GSF had to invest considerable amount of resources to get to where it is now, while everybody else kept sleeping on their 250mil SP characters.
---
Additionally, NC/PL's ~elite PVP~ recruitment policies are finally coming back to bite them in the ass. Guess what, if you reject people with super(-ready) alts because they have no vouches, then you're not going to have a lot of supers.
---
CCP changing the meta will have literally no effect, GSF will just use the next best ship in superior numbers. NC/PL need to pull the sticks out of their asses and start putting in the effort that they haven't since 2013. When having a super/titan alt in 2013 was good enough, it's now having a second super/titan alt. There really isn't any excuse for people priding themselves as being the best in the game but being unable to have another titan alt that is free to play thanks to extractors.
---
That tends to happen when the population of a game dwindles, the people doing specific activities in said game also dwindles.
---
Doesn't mean you didn't have the ability to.
---
After MO- you folded and ran. That doesn't mean you suddenly lost the ability to field fleets of such magnitude.
---
Hey there! So, yes. Sort of. The old lore was that tritanium reacts explosively with atmospheric gases, as /u/coltsfan8027 indicates. The trick is that it was later adjusted to indicate that tritanium \*alloys\* don't have nearly the same problem. For this reason, the wreck of the Shiigeru on Caldari Prime is still smoldering slowly. Likewise, in Templar One an Amarr dreadnaught does a strafing run  through atmosphere to shred some planetary defenders. It's very much rule of cool, but it constitutes an in-world example of a ship in atmosphere. Mind, it ends badly due to aerodynamic issues once it's forced to yaw in a way that ruins the planned flight path, but y'know.  
---
So, we don't really have great examples in favor, but there are a lot of wrinkles that suggest it's possible. My guess is that the answer is, "Well, the lore was saying 'no' because CCP doesn't really want to have to deal with atmospheric flight, but in reality it's much more complicated."  
---
I'd be surprised if some shuttles and frigates couldn't land, but the question of how, what sort of facilities would be required, etc., remains very much a thing.
---
Lol, okay. If we're talking "ability," the MBC had the ability to field fleets of 65,000 dudes.
---
I'm pretty sure that PL don't need money.
---
No, we pay you so we don't have to bother with your poke it with a stick and run away "tactics". We are still isk positive, and we are still getting a piece of the pie that you had a monopoly on.  Keep trying to spin that as a win for you all you want, but we took your toy. Period.
---
Are you aware that you don't need to permanently +10 allies with a shared strategic interest?
---
&gt;Sadus was basically bullshitting
---
Never in his life would Sadus "bullshit" about such an important matter. [It's True](https://media.giphy.com/media/5wWf7GR2nhgamhRnEuA/giphy.gif)
---
They aren't going to get any fights at all so I guess that's lucky
---
Oh. I'd not seen that one. BTW, frt too. Likely mostly Chinese players coming in from serenity
---
Don't waste your time explaining logical statergy here. It's going to be a shit post haven for months. Good Times!
---
Interesting. I love functional languages so I'll have to check it out.
---
Taking over Perimeter and setting up a state of the art trading and industry HS operation and paying a small percentage to PH for the sake of convenience sounds a hell of a lot better than having a 100% market share and then losing it as you all have.
---
Just out of curiosity, who was the last person they blobbed in your opinion?
---
This is currently how eve works, and something like 70-80% of the heavy lifting code is c++.
---
You are so full of shit it is funny.  
---
If this were really the case then why did X47 even happen? If NancyDock and Co didn't care, why did they show up?   
---
Spin away, since its all you have left.
---
You can’t really blame CCP for the actions of players/groups. The culture in Eve is bring more dudes than the other dudes so you can win, and now we have a situation where one group has way too many people, so why fight and lose unnecessarily? They’ve given us the sand box and toys and everyone huddles together to outnumber the enemy. 
---
Imagine an Eve where people didn’t herd together in large groups, and the sov map was a mad fucking array of colors with small wars happening all over the place.
---
I guess we could end up with so many blues that the only way to successfully end our capital roams is to fight ourselves. 
---
That seems like heaps of fun
---
"The only moral coalition is my coalition"
---
You are deluded if you think any of those entities you listed wouldn't do a full asset evac if 1k Imperium titans landed in their space.  Clashing and standing in front of a bulldozer are two totally different things.
---
No they didn't xD
---
I mean, you really like that number that was cooked up to justify abandoning the north.
---
That's fine. But don't be a dumbdumb and ignore what actually took place. If the MBC even formed 5k once during the war, I'd be surprised. And trust me, they did all hands on dicks for M-O.
---
You're telling me the CFC could only field 500 people? An all hands on dicks, bring everything op would have brought only 500? Not 2,5k, for example?
---
There are a couple of reasons, one is that restricting you to cruises is restricting you to a long range weapon system. This means killing battleships will take more time, a leshak with mystic will clear a C4 battleship faster than a cruise raven for example, if it was in range. The other issue is that most cheaper ratting setups able to tank C4 sites tend to be tinker tanked which leads a heavy preference to drones and travel time will always be working against you. Its not the worst thing but if you are planning to farm there are less restrictive setups you can go for and if you want a farm hole then setting up something else would likely be more optimal. I'll never say that it cannot be done efficiently I've just yet to see someone doing it.
---
There is irony here, considering that TAPI has the most blues in EVE.
---
A "war" implies two great rival powers are fighting in a battle of conquest or attrition. 
---
In this case, it's just Goons deleting a shit, near-dead husk of a "coalition." We're doing somebody a favor at this point.
---
Yup agreed, I’m saying some of the fun you had was in taking the moons.
---
yeah but you are wrong though lol
---
NCdot is in solid shape and PL is getting better. In the end it doesn't matter due to how everyone has blued each other up.
---
 &gt; two "y" axes ... might be hard to read
---
This is something I always try to avoid when I present data (found a [blog post](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2016/01/16/two-y-axes/) presenting some issues about dual y axes for those curious). Some popular data viz libraries just don't even let you do it (ggplot in R). 
---
I don't know what the right answer is in this case because **good** data visualization is really hard. It is one of those arts, that when it is done well, people will have no idea how much work actually went into it.
---
Yeah there’s some migration going on, just not really from B0T to PBLRD.
---
Being docked is not that special. Will you undock as UnSpoken does to fight being outnumbered? That is the question.
---
NC trash talked about UnSpoken, but now that the outnumbered are you... Just hit the "get the fuck outta here" button???
---
LOL
---
Trading. 
---
Slow start, but it picks up.
---
I like how you assume we are running as non essential shit is removed to consolidate.
---
I second this
---
The man is a True BelieverTM
---
&gt; If this were really the case then why did X47 even happen?
---
Because some people thought it could be a fun fight. It wasn't and now we're not going to do that again.
---
still, a coalition taking on Imperium would need to be a lot bigger than last time. Even if #allofeve went against them it would be equal titan numbers. 
---
Thats not fun gameplay, 1k battles are good news articles, nothing more
---
#Delete. The fucking. Structure. Damage caps. Period.
---
So you just have the boys drop MTUs.  How would this help anything?
---
Were you even playing the game during this time period? You're rather light on actual facts. The MBC wasn't even fully formed for M-O. What is going on here, I suspect, is that you've internalized the MBC to mean "NCdot + PL" and not the actual, real 65,621 man force that it actually comprised. I realize that the reality of the situation is far less romantic for you, but the facts are that we were hideously outgunned and outmanned for the entire period of time.
---
Oh my good Sir, you are indeed correct. It is only an agreement to not shoot 70% of the spaceships.
---
Additionally, looking at the alliances in Imperium+Pets coalition, the 'compatible interests' that brought them together appear to be krabbing and avoiding putting anything on the line at all costs...
---
Are u my secret admirer? I always wanted one of those.
---
Run from a Comet when you still had a chance to kill it.
---
You bring shame to your family!
---
And you're surprised? You have seen the MER threads before, yes?
---
You're looking at a lot more complicated bots, you'd need to sell the tags at an npc station or to another player, and the bots would need to scoop the MTU everytime a neut shows up in local.
---
Implying there's a great power around that can handle goons.
---
Independent yes, but when your mortal enemy is the largest alliance in the game, strong no.  Hence the reason they are unanchoring structures.
---
GOONS WILL NEVER OWN SPACE
---
TICK TOCK
---
You do realize that Salvaging bots are a thing in a bunch of places, right?
---
I mean if we have exploration bots I would imagine that programming a bot to run around, drop MTUs and loot them later would be pretty close to trivial.
---
&gt;  I'm talking about expansions on all sides of the current eve uni and far out, 3-4 times more then the current available space, and much further away from empire, further away then most like, forcing people to be nearly entirely reliant on themselves or making it much, much more expensive to ship to/from empire.
---
Anything like that would still only exist at the whims of whomever's empire they need to pass through for logistics, as it always has (see: Omist, Period Basis, etc).
---
all time solo rankings would be sick
---
If you're talking about nullsec, moon mining is a great way of doing it, but you'd need a good moon (r32 or r64), a way of refining (preferably someone in your corp/alliance with a perfect refining toon), and a way to move the product to market (either sell locally or jump freighter to Jita for sale).
---
If you have a jump freighter service and a decent nullsec market, you can also buy pirate and navy ships in Jita and sell them in a nullsec market. This requires a bit of starting capital, some patience, and knowing what does and doesn't sell, but it's great because it let's you make money when you're at work or something.
---
Depending on how robust your nullsec market is, t2 production and rig production is always great. Figure out a couple t2 mods that are likely to sell well (warp scramblers and disruptors are a good choice), figure out if it's profitable to produce, and then go to town. And again, since manufacturing is mostly a matter of waiting for timers to count down, it's another way to be productive in Eve while at work or doing chores around the house.
---
It was pretty, but utterly, utterly pointless.
---
It got the nickname "Captain's Closet" (because you were locked in it and nobody could get in or out) fairly fast because you couldn't do anything useful with it and it lacked any sort of multi-user anything which could have made it at least tangentially interesting after you spent half an hour walking around, sitting on the couch, and interacting with everything that you could interact with.
---
Then there was also the problem of it **NOT BEING OPTIONAL** (for some time) taking ship spinning from us, which caused an uproar on its own, while IIRC also being a bit of a resource hog.
---
I think that if they had managed to release it with at least *some* very rudimentary multiplayer functionality (and less :monocle:, Greed is Good bullshit accompanying it), like say inviting a few people over and some sort of interactive holographic map or multi-user ship fitting window so you could plan a roam or theorycraft some shitfits with your mates in-client, it wouldn't have drawn the hate it did. But they did and it was shit, so Jita riots, sky falling, mass unsubs, etc.
---
Yeah nothing is perfect but it adds a lot of steps and makes it harder to profit off your bots, someone comes around shooting the MTUs you're out of luck.
---
No they were what would be called griefers in other games. They always went after the sure thing. Brave over and over again, provibloc. Name an alliance they have won a war against on equal footing with them since the Casino War.
---
Even better name the alliances they have gone to war with since then.
---
I would rather them waste money into CQ and more EVE minigames than all the other failed 'next big thing' projects.
---
/r/evejobs
---
Just look at his post history this guy can't talk politely.
---
I lost interest in 0.0 because of the change in the meta for sure.  I can barely find 20 people I don't mind hanging out with, much less 20,000.  I'm ok with saying the game moved in a direction I'm not interested in, and there are other things I can do in EVE that I enjoy that have literally nothing to do with 0.0 outside of the 'predator' 'prey' mechanic set.
---
That coupled with the sale of the company to a group of money sucking assholes who I hate with a passion, and general developmental shenanigans and yea, I'm just not interested in anything that might raise CCP's image like a big public war.
---
Small gang shit is just fine by me.
---
offline mode. ;)
---
I would say anchor citadels like the astra, fortizar, sotiyo, etc as one per planet and only allow refineries to be anchored per moon.
---
Yes, but if you spook a bot out of a site, you can kill its MTU and get iskies that the bot does not get.
---
\*gasps\* monster...
---
Does this include the ore anomalies?
---
then why do i keep listening to it
---
What would be required is a massive reduction in ehp of supers and titans as well as an additional nerf to fax repping power for anyone to considering going into a fight against imperium capital force. Absent those no one will fight the Imperium's titan/super fleet so all those members that grinded a year to have a shiney toy that will see no meaningful action outside responding to tackled rorquals.
---
BODY DA LIONS
---
JEW JEWJEW DEW DEW
---
thats my favorite part. idk wat it means but i like it
---
\&gt;they have nobody to place there
---
The Bastion, TNT, Snuffed Out etc could have a claim.
---
Abolish Plex.
---
Don't interfere with the TEST victim complex. They can have imperium and gotg showing up on their side and they are still the little guys.
---
Goons will not be allowed to form fleets larger than 200 pilots.
---
I notice the lack of Horde being mentioned yet they held that space the 3rd longest?
---
What no love for cynos in wormholes?  Thought you guys prided yourself on living in the most dangerous space because there is no local.
---
This. Imagine not having to scan down and land on the vni before it gets safe?  You could come in with two or three people and wreck a system of bitters loot just by blowing up their MTUs. I’m sure they’d scoop some but highly doubt they’d get them all. 
---
Would definitely create some content for the small gang roam.
---
Wait what? Is there a cache of Goon supers stuck somewhere that never got moved, or is this just a joke?
---
To quote a recent post of mine, in a thread on how has Eve changed:
---
&gt; "If you want to mine, join Goons!"
---
&gt;    
---
&gt;  Wait ... what?
---
The only option left is to win eve. Can i have your stuff?
---
nerfing caps would just make battleships the new titans, it will always be n+1 with the biggest and best ship
---
What we need is a reason to live more spread, you shouldn't be able to put 40k dudes in a region. CCP have effectively removed every content creators in the game.
---
Its not that many years ago since we had a bunch of alliances and small scale wars all over the map
---
Sure, there will be gateways that need to be dealt with, but you can't hold them all, can you? I didn't say expanding out to those areas wouldn't be difficult. It would be more of an area where people who know how to be self sufficient would go, who don't need daily trips to empire to survive, something goons are unable to do.
---
Except for Snuff both TNT and Bastion would basically be trashed without Goon supers
---
Too late.
---
Panfam have evicted me for several time , my stuff are noe stuck in asset safety limbo forever.
---
[https://eve-corps.com/search](https://eve-corps.com/search)
---
Init are also pretty close.
---
Right?
---
To Tribute ? Not close enough to save rorquals and supers
---
I remember!
---
Karmafleet bro it's where the fun is atm
---
I may not be paying a ton of attention to the game lately, but it sounds like they're preparing to defend, but also making it so if they DO lose, they're not losing all their assets. 
---
Could turn out to be a good war.
---
Where do they post their strategic participation every month?
---
There’s nothing like the rush you get from turning the safety off and locking up your first real target in pvp. Then the first time you win an engagement. Ive been playing on and off since 2006 and I still get a rush every time I engage in pvp (read: almost daily) but nothing compares to the first.  No other video game out there have I experienced this. Not sure what it is, but I love it and it’s what keeps me coming back.
---
I don't know why you think it would become that, instead of just another far away quiet land that is ideal for botting/renting because no one travels there and you've just drastically decreased the effective traffic any one place is going to get by further decreasing the player density.
---
dont be sad about it, shooting each other is the whole point of the game. its fun. what alliance are you in?
---
Remove the Eve official forums.
---
Exploration in a cloaky Astero. Or if you’re in a null alliance that owns decent space, fit a hauler with a cloak and an expanded scan probe launcher with combat probes and go scan down abandoned drones and fighters. Both are less boring than vni ratting and will teach you an invaluable skill: scanning.
---
Yeah that was always the dream... unfortunately Eve players' inherent risk aversion or just human nature makes everyone want to blue up and only fight when they are assured victory or the stakes are low.
---
branch is nowhere remotely close to 70% of the MER of delve.
---
Interesting idea. Remind me how much people NC &amp; PL have in their alliances ?
---
Wtf is with the first link
---
If they are not able to scoop these, they wouldn't be able to defend it either.
---
The complexity isn't the problem. Even the most complicated tasks in EVE could be scripted fairly easily by a dedicated team. The "defense" here is that corps can hunt bots - as when they flee a system whenever a nuet enters they lose a % of their wealth from unrecoverable loot. This gives players further incentives to hunt bots building on the sandbox principle.
---
Yes, this has always puzzled me. Why was this introduced at all?
---
Dude, what a hilarious and original joke. Not like people have been making this same joke for 10 years or anything.
---
Panfam and NC not blueing half of EVE? what decade is this exactly? one that never existed?
---
Contents of the ship, not salvaging the ship.
---
Won't prevent TEST from showing on every medium to major timers with at least 200 retards be it in bombers, and we all know how stukas are retarded right now.
---
The BR link?
---
Yeah. We saw in Dronelands. Your PvP is going against groups that you outnumber by huge numbers and that is it.
---
But when you are faced by someone who shoots you back, unanchor and run as fast as possible. 
---
That is so elite PEWvPEWer alliance... LMAO
---
I'd pay mad cash for a Garret/Mr. T -stylized voice pack in place of Aura.
---
same.  when i returned to EvE a little over 3 years ago, I knew how much easier it was to operate with a bit of isk so I sold a plex to get off the ground.
---
Yes, lets blame players for making moves that are massively mechanically incentivized.
---
I'm sure if the imperium self destructed their super fleet and split up their coalition, everyone else would follow, right? Surely NC and PL would do the same im sure.
---
Because you more than likely played the triangle badly in school and your easy to please.
---
because you are blue to everyone else? Test linemembers are fucking retarded lmao
---
Ouch, your words sting. But plsh, troll on.
---
Yeah, why is it youtube redirect
---
I mined Veldspar, tons of it.
---
First in a Retriever, then in an orca xD
---
Was watching stuff on my other screen and chatting, so it was not that bad. On a very good day, i could make up to 35 million ISK if i mined for about 8-10 hours.
---
Sure, lets keep the current course, it sure seems health for the game to have a singular mega corporation that has access to any space in the entire games universe in less then 24h notice if they wanted to.
---
Lets ask the Chinese players how that's worked out for their server, I'm sure it's a vibrant and healthy PvP atmosphere with tons and tons of factions fighting it out.
---
Oh, fucking wait, it's not. Look, I get you want literally the exact same bullshit to happen here because you are that single mega corporation that basically controls the entire game currently, but do kindly fuck off with your "oh no that would hurt our pvp if we can't roam into their space in 20 minutes and demoralize them out of sov in a few days" bullshit. There would be PvP, just not with you. Oh the fucking horror of you not being the center of the universe.
---
It's scorched earth. It's them trying to stop us from reaping the benefits from their land by burning it so we can't, um, :checks notes: use it.
---
Makes you wonder why those kind of types aren't produced at a higher rate if they are in such high demand.
---
Sort bending the knee doesn't help maintaining ties with DeadCo.
---
PH going on their turf was PH's decision, but DeadCo is like "Let's fight with goon to attack NCPL territory because fuck it".
---
Can't trust people like that right ?
---
Goons were not even close to being this outnumbered
---
Aaaaand they now are crying about being outnumbered.
---
NCPL needs to be memed to end of times.
---
To be expected sadly.
---
Got an old corpmate go to TEST some times ago, now he drinks koolaid like his life depends on it and spitting on us because we're on the wrong side.
---
No, they were A-OK with spending their time krabbing, as long as they didnt have to admit to it.
---
agility is irrelevant, cycle time on prop dictates warp time, your sig is bloomed for close to instalock.
---
Imagine believing this
---
The last time I was deployed in the drone lands was when a few PL guys had Hels in Omist.
---
Remind me when NC tried to evict TEST again ?
---
It you think about PL campaign, they failed stupidly, does it really need a koolaid revenge plot ?
---
As for the regions thingy, they didn't get the "no need for 750 system to build things" from goons, which is bad.
---
Tis a shame the only way to reliably get to deep dronelands renters is by random whs.
---
hang on I'll fix it
---
Add more solar systems to general map...  none of this wormhole / filament B.S.   Maybe even a new galaxy that players have to unlock an ancient gate to get to.
---
"Perkele!"
---
Threw the youtube link in the wrong spot because I'm dumb so I edited it into the post instead.
---
  It’s not a 3rd party when Test its on Goons side. Every time Imperium shoot the North.
---
I kind of doubt Legacy will show up in large numbers more than a couple of times.
---
A good pair that handles this site and also adds the instrumental as a soloable site: no prop dual rep prophecy for most, Oracle (preferably with t2 beams) for instrumental and the sentries. 
---
They both use the same BC skill. Prophecy just drops MTU and kills with drones and choice of missiles. Kill frigates first because they seem to aggro drones the most.
---
Oracle has two requirements: lock/shoot beyond 150km and move faster, cap stable, than 1k m/s. Clear the sentries from 100km+ and kite the instrumentals from 150km+ and it wont take damage. 
---
Probably can be accomplished with naga/drake and tornado/hurricane as well, but I think Oracle was the top performer on the instrumental for dps at that range.
---
I'm not trying to recruit here. But I will say my ingame name is Sah'ra and we are working to do this in the QFC. No blues except for individual friends, fights way under 100 players per fleet, etc. Its possible to have what you're looking for, but a lot of people just wanna krab.
---
Yeah remove of the best changes that kept eve alive.
---
What
---
A very large chunk of C5/C6 wormholes are taken as farm only holes. Groups like Hard Knocks and LZHX control double digit numbers of wormholes so that their members can farm without interfering with normal wormhole pvp.
---
Of course this also means these holes will be badly defended, especially if they're owned by a smaller group. A lot of these are fully AFK too as most wormhole groups are bleeding members to inactivity.
---
Bots would be able to do that very well. 
---
Real players wouldn’t, and would mostly just stop ratting.
---
None. WHoler. But we have friends in a little group in Etherium. And they are under NC + SkillU cloakycamp and being trahstalked in local -I have seen it myself.- and fighting as they can to save some ihubs and athanors. Even when their home is -0.017 LMAO 
---
Everything i read here, is poetic justice.
---
What’s wrong with the word retarded?
---
Lol literally "didn't want those regions anyway"
---
Its really sad that the whole walking in stations didn't happen for one reason or another, so much potential wasted....however with our new Korean overlords maybe we could see something since it really is a gold mine for micro transactions
---
they can always kill the sacrificial lamb if they get bored. TEST space is even closer than ours.
---
This is some next level spin
---
Literally standard procedure... move unused shit out, sell it, and stock up on combat doctrines. Acting like this is even noteworthy is dumb
---
Yeah we should remember all those outstanding victories they've won in the last couple of years, such as
---
Like wheel of fortune, but more fun
---
Jester made a lot of really good points about WIS in his AMA. Basically, CCP fucked up by refusing to use an existing engine for WIS, so they spent years developing an in-house solution that when released to the players as a feature that no one asked for, not only failed to meet any of the lofty expectations that CCP set us up for, it was literally melting peoples graphics cards. Couple that with CCPs habitual lack of iteration on half-developed features and the years of future development required to make WIS an actual feature and not just useless window dressing at the expense of the actual internet spaceships game falling apart around them, and players were rightly outraged. It was a stupid fucking feature that served zero purpose in a game that was about spaceships shooting each other, and like I said, no one asked for it. Also, just because a handful of players might like the idea of walking around in a station, the playerbase en-mass made their opinions on the subject VERY clear in the summer of 2011, and CCP wasn't going to touch that subject again with a 50 foot pole.
---
The reason why CCP held on to space barbies and wardrobes and monocles after WIS was dumpstered was (paraphrasing Jester's words) because CCP wanted the player to have a strong connection to an avatar, otherwise all that would be left for the player to make a connection to would be their ship, and the ultimate purpose of a ship is to blow up, so the player would be less risk averse to losing a ship if there was less of a personal connection to it.
---
Oh yeah this definitely isn’t a one group problem, just as someone said above it’s human nature - risk averse and herd like mentality. Goons just happen to be the fortunate one to be the biggest group. 
---
I strongly believe that this game would be in a much better place if it weren’t for massive alliances/coalitions/blue doughnuts. However that’ll never happen, and nothing CCP can do will fix that.
---
I tried to offensively ESS a system filled with bots last week in Period Basis.  I flew out there with a Svipul, planted it, and safe logged next to it, logging back in at 30 minute intervals to see how much ISK was stored up in it.
---
One of my ARAM games went on a little longer than normal, and when I logged in, I noticed that it had been empty'd out by someone.
---
I realized that no matter who accesses the ESS, the "Share All" feature will always take only 30 seconds, while the "Take All" feature will take significantly more. So all it takes is one of the human bot handlers to look over on their screen, notice the the ESS, and go empty it for his bots using the Share All feature, and he's out in 30 seconds. If I were to try and steal tags from the ESS that I personally anchored, it'd still take me over 3 minutes to complete it.
---
So, if you want to create a system where botters just leave a pod next to the ESS, anchored in a fully triggered Forlorn Hub, and any neutral the enters the system triggers a 30 second Share command to be issued (effectively liquidating all of the ISK in the ESS and depositing it into the walets of the bots), sure. 
---
I think the ESS as its current iteration, is absolute shit.
---
They probably had Nestor logi
---
Just because you are about to get facefucked by a bigger blob, doesn't mean you are innocent.
---
... i dont see what that has to do with this. your not wrong but still. completely unrelated
---
this is an art
---
Why does it matter
---
If they can't scoop now they definitely can't defend then later, might as well try
---
Tldr "duh"
---
I know :(
---
🤔🤔🤔🤔 It's a trap, or bait. Or both.
---
speaking out of experdise i guess?
---
Jesus dude, I'm not saying that _something_ doesn't need to change, just that the solution isn't so simple as "add more hard to access space".  With Serenity, since you brought it up, in some ways, the cluster _was_ effectively "larger" -- it had the same physical size, but never nearly as many players populating it.  It clearly didn't help.  That's a bit different than the power projection argument, obviously, but I'm not sure it matters much if it takes a 24 or 48 hours to move.  "It's a bit of a hassle" rarely stops mass deployments.
---
And of course, I don't know what the answer is, but that doesn't prevent me from guessing the logical conclusion of "add more hard to access space", as we have plenty of information to go on right now.
---
Uh no. Those were the titans that decided to deploy.
---
New meta : imperium win without undocking. Oh yeah what a good day to see this ;)
---
A nomadic NCPL superfleet roaming regularly from low wouldn't be a bad thing for the game, though I am not sure how easy it would be on pilots used to using keepstars rather than logging titans out in space.  Would certainly make life interesting for Snuffed Out.
---
We must become sobernost komred
---
i like this idea
---
They are gonna be memed to Oblivion anyway.
---
They are the big bad elite pvper that bully some little groups, beating their chest and trashtalking... Then runing away before a single Ibis gets on their grid.
---
Oh man, i'm gonna to enjoy this... XD
---
"i just want free kills on ratters, but i'll pretend it'll solve botting"
---
oh look, another of these threads.
---
Me gusta
---
I meant that the framework for bounties as items exists in the form of those tokens the ESS system creates, not that you use the ESS.
---
\^\^\^
---
So you would rather CCP develop farmville in station and other WOW themepark bullshit then work on the actual sandbox internet spaceship game?
---
\^\^\^ That but also damn you MJD :)
---
Like test who immediately rolled over after the border fortizar incident despite legacy being far closer to an equal match to imperium than panfam
---
Not too sure if you're meming or are just too new to the game to know that rogue drones actually did used to drop drone compounds (colloquially referred to as "drone poo"). Rogue drone NPCs had no bounties at all. They didn't even increase your sec status.
---
Ratting in drone regions meant you had to loot all wrecks to make any ISK, and there were of course botting carriers clearing hordes and players would come behind with macro'd salvagers and haulers to collect the poo. It would then be refined to minerals and used to build supers locally, with the massive amount of leftover hauled to Jita, refined there, and sold as minerals on the market.
---
That one aspect is what made highsec ore mining pointlessly unprofitable because the supply of minerals from drone regions was so torrential. That mistake informed a lot of the mining gameplay we now have today. It was very profitable to kill the DRF coalition JFs that were hauling this stuff to Jita. In fact I made enough ISK for my first super carrier and titan just by killing these JFs and scooping the poo they were hauling.
---
Love you too malaka &lt;3
---
They should have started doing that the literal day after X47-
---
But the vast sense of entitlement - "we've been given huge wealth because we had lots of titans for years, CCP should continue to hand us everything on a plate" - kinda got in the way.
---
A future dread pilot. Maybe we will WELP them side by side.
---
&gt;So you would rather CCP develop farmville in station then work on the actual internet spaceship game?
---
Yes, that's exactly what I implied.
---
&gt;Then you're held in place for a short while if you choose to rat, though not long enough it doesn't give you a chance to escape if your actually playing, but enough that a bot wouldn't have the AI to handle. Possibly even random amounts of time to stop it from being scripted.
---
This doesn't even make sense. 
---
"enough that a bot wouldn't have the AI to handle"
---
what the fuck?
---
PL couldn't even face off Test in a fair fight (Provi), so no, I don't expect you to face off Goons.  Still, it would have been fun to see you try.  It's only a game after all.
---
I object ;)
---
likely most things with full rigs won't be pulled early, let alone T2 rigs.
---
Everyone dogpiles to reset them.  But even then they have their wallets.
---
It'll be nice to hopefully see some new faces on the sov maps
---
lol... agility affects acceleration. also, i dont need mwd on mammoth, ab works fine.
---
What roaming, though? They just squatted in Tribute for over 2 years and never did shit except one loldeployment to Syndicate and a brief, half-hearted attempt to suppress rorquals in Delve.
---
PL haven’t required vouches for over a year.
---
That is what, 2 average systems worth of structures about?
---
&gt;I don't at all! NC has always been nomadic
---
wut? You've gone nowhere in the last 2 years
---
Also remove damage caps.
---
if you blob you have no SPACE HONOR, why cant those dirty goons SEE THAT
---
There were a bunch of demos of Dust/EVE crossover ideas that never materialized, one being the ability for Dust players to be able to board ships and stations to affect a fight in EVE. Personally I thought it was a stupid fucking idea. Right up there with real players flying fighters.
---
They’d have to ya know blue them back
---
Lets gocto germinate after tribute is unanchored! At least pabfam loose a lot of isk because of the rig, asset safety, and supercap prod canceled. It really terrible for panfam and moral member.
---
Now, lets go to germinate because tribute is unanchored ;D
---
Imagine having a single fuck to give about 0.0
---
Fucking bots and Chinese corps, and corps full of Chinese Bots in this game.
---
CCP I fucking hate you. Really I do.
---
Where blues kill each other’s rorquals but not lay a finger on jump bridges or structures.
---
I see you brought your towel.
---
Agreed, it will.
---
They would never risk a Summer of Rage 2.0, which is exactly what it would be.
---
The diplomats completely fucked up
---
this!
---
It'd take 5 minutes to implement a check for this, you'd simply have to check the status effects for the blue warp disruptor icon if you're doing a screen reading bot, or if you're a 900 iq genius it'd be easy to read from memory.
---
They literally can hide... there’s only 2 more required login days left and even that you don’t need to actually spawn a character in space to claim rewards.
---
Sub alt, titan/super alt, fax alt per super/titan, and dread alt is the norm for PL
---
Love you Snuff but never again in Black Rise. You hug too tide.  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/71464578/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/71464578/)
---
Yeah, ‘cause anchor &amp; press F1 is sooooo much better.
---
You will soon after i bring another Phoenix in Horde space.
---
how many posts Tapi will do when they kill something?
---
The ONLY good thing to come out of WIS and the subsequent return of the hangar view was the introduction of the ship spin counter.
---
I don't understand what you guys have been doing all this time, if not building supers and titans?  I mean you log in and... what?
---
SSSSHHHHHHHHHH
---
real link here [https://br.inyour.space/?s=800,4194&amp;b=8605740&amp;e=150,330&amp;t=qab](https://br.inyour.space/?s=800,4194&amp;b=8605740&amp;e=150,330&amp;t=qab)
---
Depends where they go on their "retreat" and how close to Delve it is.
---
That’s bullshit statement! Back than plnc would roll in with 200 super and nobody would fight them. What the fuck you taking about “they had the Balls”?
---
Not having the Balls! Is completely different than Feeding!
---
Don’t be stupid.
---
Thanks for having me. I had a blast.
---
Innocent of what, blobbing ?
---
It was the month before M-O that you should have been helping CO2 defend lol
---
By the time M-O came around the whole game was fighting you (which is why I was flying with Spectre for lols at that time)
---
At least one more
---
Or just someone that didn't guzzle Mittens koolaid
---
Says the single largest coalition in the game for a decade and a half
---
But you wouldn't have the time tied to it. So even if it knows it's pointed, it wouldn't know for how long, this why I said to have it timed randomly.
---
Probably test/co2 in the north
---
Make a character’s race matter. If not, remove faction standing penalty
---
Wait is is and who isn’t I’m lost
---
Exactly, which is why they ditched it. Why even put in the effort if only 1.2% of the player base uses it?
---
Or cut them in half at least.
---
Remember that PLEX is a major trading item. The volume came from people buying the plex off market to take advantage of the sale. Unlock out of game direct purchase sales. So the volume is made up a lot of the time of PLEX being sold between players. Often changing hands many times before use.
---
Hope I'll see you then!
---
lol what, no one in nc. thinks a 25k coalition can do anything against 90k dudes.
---
No one wants 1k battles that lasts for 14 hours.
---
Fiction, I don't remember this at all and I have a main from early '04.
---
Real force?
---
REAL FORCE?
---
So you're telling me that Pandemic Horde had a real 10,000 people ready to fight in every battle? And you're telling me, that CFC and friends could right now field 100k people as the coalition numbers suggest?
---
Holy crap, you're more delusional than I remembered.
---
Not luck, no.  They baited the Brits and French towards the Belgian border, then cut them off with a surprise thrust through the Ardennes, which nobody thought passable.
---
I do make spreadsheets for people from time to time. DM me and I'll see what I can do.
---
Start aligning, then every second repeat the check until you no longer can find the warp disruptor icon, once it's no longer present go ahead and do your standard warp out.
---
Cause those types of salvage come from regions where hardly anyone lives or if there are residents, they aren't salvaging in large numbers.
---
I think you probably wana look at that math again.
---
True Beeliever^(TM)
---
You sure are doing some damage control today man. It's not healthy to get this invested in a vidya game
---
I'm happy you guys no longer have bookmark issues!
---
&gt;Hope they learned their lesson this time.
---
\&gt;CCP
---
\&gt;Learning Lessons
---
Pick one.
---
It’s not even a full asset evac, it’s a standard non-combat evac and shutdown of non essential targets. Literally the oldest thing to do in the game
---
So this was kind of like the crushing hammer blow the germans attempted in ww1 but failed to accomplish? After that the French just crumpled?
---
1. Check the number of voters lately? The CSM needs a public face or else it's going to be the GSM forever. I'm pretty sure the bulk of the CSM *does* agree on most things. It's just you're not part of the party. But even if it is the GSM forever, the CSM is going to be increasingly irrelevant in an environment where CCP gets to set a code of conduct. There's roughly a 100% chance that code of conduct is going to hamstring a lot of CSM options. Example: You need to be asking Falcon, right now, if the code of conduct is going to allow CSM14 members to disagree with CCP in public. A public leader adds value in that the public leader can engage the player base when CCP does something dumb or when they do something awesome.
---
2. Doesn't matter. Yes, past Little Things efforts included lots of things that are difficult or impossible (notably the ability to switch characters once you've logged in). But they've also included hundreds of things that are in the game today. And for the impossible things, by presenting them to CCP in public, you both (a) stress that the player base still wants these things; and (b) get CCP to make statements about which things are impossible and why. Because oh by the way, sometimes the impossible things suddenly become possible when the right person shows up to address them. I've been there to watch one CCP dev do something another CCP dev said was impossible. And of course, running a Little Things effort is a simple way for the CSM to add value for both the devs and the players.
---
3. The player base is engaged when they see value-add being provided by the CSM. Bet you a large sum of money that if CCP took a survey of the players right now and question one was "Have you heard of the CSM?" and question two was "If you answered 'yes' to question one, does the CSM provide value to the players?" the answer to question one would be about 75% no/25% yes, and the answer to question two would be about the same.
---
a bot will deal with it in the exact same way a player will.
---
align out, spam warp until the point drops. a bot doesn't do anything differently to a player, it just does it without the player being present.
---
telling retards they are wrong because they can't think on their own is pretty funny dude, there are actual people believing eve propaganda
---
SERENITY
---
ratters are helpless creatures who are unable to work together to provide safety for themselves 
---
oh wait, they already do and are capable of it
---
removing local fixes botting and the shitty 'dockupifanyonehostileisclose' loophole of eve online
---
Don’t worry, this war we will be meming all over them and their keeps
---
... and yet the world still revolves and doesn't care.
---
I’d like a “Captain Marvel” module, can only be fit to Assault Frigates and, when activated, allows said AF to punch holes through any capital ship. 
---
Can only be activated in Low/Null/WH space
---
Sure, but it still got held up enough they're is a chance of being caught.
---
Just delete ratting
---
Why do you think we're deploying North? For fights? For E-honor? Hell no. We're Dunkirk'ing our lost supers so our krabs can all make a 12th account to rat with.
---
Or Thera. There's three nullsec holes in there so it's very likely that at least one of them goes to drones most of the time.
---
They SpY has leaked the info.
---
Beside the only entity not blue to goons is PamFam and Winter Co. The rest is of EvE is Blue or Bluetral.
---
removing local doesn't fix botting at all. it just provides free kills of pve ships to lazy people.
---
lets be real, if there was no local then you [as a legit player] wouldn't bother VNI ratting for sub 20m per tick. and bots would carry on, but they'd just farm level 4 missions or something.
---
Yet TEST still keeps blabing about fear of eviction, not from NCPL but from a smaller force like FRAT.
---
This is the level of hubris. Point is, it makes null stale, and that's why, we don't have a war today.
---
Sure, but still got held up enough there's a chance of being caught, the point is to make it not completely safe, and not completely unfair at the same time.
---
“So there was this one thing that happened that one time, so we all went to Delve and shot things”.      ~Forest Gump
---
I thought you were the non-deficient one over there?
---
What's the solution?  I can't think of one in gameplay terms, except something really extreme like pre-arranged combat with roughly equal sides, alliance tournament style.  Otherwise yea, Eve is going to become extremely boring.  It's already kind-of dull in Goons, with no real external threat.
---
NC/PL like to talk a boatload of shit about how they're elite pvpers and love the gudfites, etc etc. But, historically they're massive cowards that only really engage with weaker parties, whom they can drop super blobs on. See: provi. Even last summer they only really formed a few times for show. There's a reason their nickname is NCdock.
---
PL would have to actually log in and play the game in order to blob.
---
So you agree his statement was silly
---
There could be, but lack of testicles...
---
Hans Molemanishly: MY super is still stuck in 93PI....
---
so you admit you just want free kills, and this does nothing to stop botting.
---
Best of luck with the merge and may your bookmarks be limitless!
---
My structure bashing alts are my mining alts
---
I think you, like many others, are taking flares seriously. I haven't been in snigg for over two years I just never changed it.
---
Yep, like the Elite Dangerous voice packs. They got Shatner and a few others. Pretty cool stuff.
---
I don't recall ever hearing from old timers that this was a thing.
---
Alright, not "you", "them".
---
alliance bookmarks
---
wormholer btw
---
Ask atrum, maybe he help u
---
This is surprising? lol i guess you need some sort of hype?
---
Even as an older character I have been diving into wormholes on the daily after being evicted from my last hole...
---
Good bye astra, I barely knew thee
---
Should clarify that I am staging out of HS space
---
Well this post didn't age well lmao
---
What's your tinker fit?
---
&gt;removing local fixes botting and the shitty 'dockupifanyonehostileisclose' loophole of eve online
---
If I was ratting in a no-local nullsec system, I'd just put an alt cloaked on the other side of the gate to that system and dock up as soon as I see something on said alt's overview. Sure, I'll need to keep that alt subbed (or use a throwaway alpha sitting in a pod) but that doesn't really change anything.
---
They learned that line from the ones that were best at it.
---
uh
---
didn't tapi evac south before they were ever invaded? because they didn't want their krabs getting farmed?
---
And your acceleration is also irrelevent in that you will still not warp until the prop finishes cycling
---
no *one* cares
---
pl 2300 toons nc 3600 toons so thats 	5900 toons while test has 16000 toons. but hey dont let the facts destroy your narrative.
---
Will need at least one more video of someone anchoring and pressing f1 with random music blasting
---
Shit, name ANY time since 2009, other than getting their asses handed to them in Provi and harassing Brave, PL actually started a war of their own instead of just 3rd partying on the winning side.
---
Now instead of "Can someone trade bookmarks to Unpu?" we have "Who the fuck forgot to mark return hole".
---
Hacking and relic cans are a bit of a mixed bag, the rewards range from 1-2 isk all the way up to (in the case of high class content like ghost sites) 5 bil from a single can
---
Happy Cake Day
---
Something like [this](https://pastebin.com/9P0ymeQj) with crystals, but you can unbling at the cost of damage.
---
&gt; but that doesn't really change anything.
---
except when someone logs into your system, or blopses people in
---
having a scout doesn't change the status quo
---
Jibba jabba in local!  I pity the fool who lemmings!
---
The Schliffen Plan involved the wheeling of the right-wing of the army to encircle Paris.  The allies, expecting similar in 1940, moved to counter this.  Ironically it had been the German plan originally, but an officer carrying the plan was forced to land in Belgium and the plan fell into allied hands.  Manstein came up with a new plan which involved the "Sickle Cut" (Sichelschnitt) through the Ardennes to cut off the allies.
---
WTF is atrum.
---
We don't pretend we don't blob.
---
The best part is we haven't even announced where we are deploying to yet. NC/PL are preemptively preparing for an invasion that may or may not be coming.
---
not the case at all, low acceleration can mean you dont hit your warp within 1 cycle. please bend reality more to fit your erroneous statements...
---
Init bravely singlehandedly took down the first keepstar
---
Of course not. Don't be dumb. Fact of the matter is, character numbers are useful for one thing: to describe the ratio of people who are actively fighting. And since 65k / 16k is about 4, that means that we were outnumbered by at least 4x all of the time in 2016. Most of the time it was even worse than that, due to our low morale and hostiles' very, very high morale.
---
&gt; removing local doesn't fix botting at all. 
---
it makes it consistently easy to kill bots
---
&gt;it just provides free kills of pve ships to lazy people.
---
hunting ratters isn't about being lazy or not lazy, people will easily avoid you because they have a huge window of time to escape
---
there isn't an amount of effort you need to put in to catch ratters, you just need to be lucky and hope they're afk/dumb/broken/new
---
&gt;lets be real, if there was no local then you [as a legit player] wouldn't bother VNI ratting for sub 20m per tick. and bots would carry on, but they'd just farm level 4 missions or something.
---
I wouldn't implement the changes in a vacuum, I'd buff the number of anoms in systems significantly and improve bounties by 35-50%
---
Remove warp to 0
---
Make local constellation-wide instead of system-wide.
---
&gt; it makes it consistently easy to kill bots
---
so like i said - just want free kills, don't actually care about botting.
---
See my edit
---
How about your provide constructive criticism instead of being a dick, why is this a "terrible maller video"
---
jesus are you really this stupid or trolling
---
if i wanted to i can kill far more doing highsec shenanigans than nullsec vnis, it's not about 'easy kills' it's about fixing the nullsec ecosystem
---
I'm sorry.
---
But isn't it a bit ironic you seem to be moaning about alliances blue each other.
---
&gt;but enough that a bot wouldn't have the AI to handle.
---
why do you think an ai wouldn't be able to handle this? if a bot is already issuing commands and acting based on in game situations it would likely be trivial to add in this capability
---
if ( neutral in system == true ) {
---
deagress
---
align
---
if ( pointed == false ) warp; // don't even need to check if pointed, just keep warping until it works
---
}
---
you literally just admitted to the very original point i made.
---
if you just turn nullsec ratters in to free kills, you don't stop botting. they just move to something that doesn't feed VNIs to solo roamers.
---
make more conflict drivers. Depletable regions, make people having to spread out more. 
---
There is nothing to gain from taking a region today, sov means nothing. Make sov relevant again, limit citadels somehow, make low sec relevant again, make high sec relevant again, make faction warfare relevant again
---
Citadels, Rorquals, skill injectors and moon changes fucked up the economy so hard you can't compete unless you're a null seccer. Basically CCP have changed the game to only cater to big null blocs. They need to make all the other playstyles viable again, its not like we haven't been there before, we can get there again.
---
People are always going to get allies, but you can give them reasons to betray those allies
---
Well of course every transport needs to be able to align fully within it prop cycle, thats not what the issue is.
---
to buku, 1 ISK!
---
Exploration in an astero!
---
Remember when the Soviets had 20 million men to throw against the invaders. Guess who the meatshield in this war is going to be. I'll give you a hint...
---
I think cyno’s would make it much less dangerous. If your getting evicted you just cyno in all your buddies and cyno out all your valuables. No more risk. I don’t hate cyno’s just don’t think they have a place in wormholes.
---
How is saying "It makes bots easy to kill" not imply that it fixes the botting issue?
---
The botting issue is a symptom of a larger problem- local.
---
Fix local, bots become easy to kill, and the bot problem goes away. If you can't understand this then god damn.
---
Interesting.  Also sad.
---
&gt; not imply that it fixes the botting issue?
---
because you've done nothing to stop them.
---
I don't the male reproductive organs are the problem when trying to take on the largest coalition by leaps and bounds.
---
personally? or the suggested changes?
---
That's awesome. So I guess technically the French were evenly matched, they just got massively outplayed?
---
You mean actually utilize the space you own, and only own space that you can utilize and protect. I know, farms and fields is killing EVE.
---
How's that rental empire working our for you guys?
---
Basically, yes.
---
It really is, I was in TEST during parts of PLs prime and remembered being in awe of them, terrified of them. The rest of the game grew, and the were stagnant, the rest of the game just caught up.
---
Shit man. You solved everything in one post.
---
Specifically, 1 ISK is approximately a dirt-side family's yearly income
---
No one cares that I literally called this? Seems like some butthurt PanFam members care enough to downvote this and you cared enough to comment.
---
I support your manifesto.
---
but horde is not a crabbing alliance like goons or test
---
To be fair that's like most fleet fight videos presented here. Low effort trash.
---
Maybe someday you will be relevant.
---
So you guys promise to undock this time?
---
Probably lagged out fleet fights.
---
CCP over promisisng as usual.
---
Ah no. Dust originally ran on the carbon engine, the same thing CQ was done in. There was an idea at CCP that dust and eve would connect via CQ and WiS. This never materialized, but was the intention for a while. WoD shut down long before CQ was removed. It wasn't until Dust was in its twilight stage that CQ was removed.
---
All those hours that went into games that went nowhere. If the CQ made $0.50 a quarter it would be more than than the games CCP put money into that wasn't Eve.
---
Out of all the alliances still in the game, NCPL pilots probably have the most experience with space coffins. The vast majority of say, goon, test, frt and horde supers that resulted from the age of rorquals always had citadels available to them.
---
That's ignoring that fortizars are hilariously cheap and you can just spread out and log off on one.
---
Plot twist, Wally hired goons to hit NC.. Rumor has it ( which I just made up ) that Wally paid Mittens to hit NC. with a jf full of exotic dancer, male.
---
Personally I'd just like it if they stopped reskinning and re-designing ships. Gimme back my old Navy Comet skin and asymmetric caldari battleships.
---
Because it's a sandbox game. There isn't a single win condition or goal for the entirety of the playerbase
---
For T1s I use a standard Vexor with blasters and a web for the enemy drones.  Has one medium armor rep always running. Cap stable.  Only has an afterburner, though.
---
Salvaging bots can loot the wrecks.
---
while it still was one sided of course they where usually outnumbered in terms of total players but they had the supercap majority which allowed them to still win. Now over 65% of the playerbase is part of one coalition with supercap majority

Yes you have happened upon my point. Why make the video?. It seems like a lot of editing for....

Haha no u

Killing renters 👌
---
not everyone wants to build a crabbing paradise tho
---
&gt;Jesus dude, I'm not saying that *something* doesn't need to change, just that the solution isn't so simple as "add more hard to access space".
---
But it is that simple. When was the last time a substantial amount of claimable 0.0 space was added? It's been a long, long time. There are entities out there that want space but not have to rub elbows with the largest coalitions in the game who dictate who and who doesn't get space to build up in and grow without being stomped out and harassed out of existence before they even get going and end up having to just be absorbed into the already established mega coalitions.
---
&gt;"It's a bit of a hassle" rarely stops mass deployments.
---
Not currently, because you can deploy anywhere in under 24h. Everyone has a titan blob and everyone wants to use it, so CCP has made sure everyone can by making them extremely easy to move because of the amount of crying surrounding them and supers - and that shuts out anyone who doesn't have them from holding any  meaningful amount of sov without explicit agreements with the those that have them. It's no secret that the only way to hold any meaningful amount of sov is to have some kind of agreement with goons, and that's not healthy for the game, at all. If you don't have an agreement with them you're just a content farm, you just don't know it yet.
---
Allowing titans/supers to take gates was one of the biggest jokes there is and a very bad idea for the long term health of 0.0 conflict but that decision will never be reversed. It's too late now, most would revolt because they're too used to it now. The only other option is to expand space to the point where it IS a huge pain in the ass to move a super fleet where people don't want to do it except for a serious escalation of conflict that actually requires them.
---
You have to get to a point where those that have them actually prefer to just move sub caps instead of a cap fleet, even vs a few keep stars. One of the only other options is expanding space dramatically. Another option is dramatically increasing the cost of upkeep based on the number of anchored items your alliance has, payed to concord or something, that increased exponentially to where it's would cost so much to maintain what, say for example, what goons have in delve that they'd have to offline 3/4 of what they have or be drained extremely quickly. To prevent them from just using alt corps/alliances, add a multiplier for anchoring stuff in space not owned by you.
---
lol what? where did the large enemy force idea come into this? we're talking about bots and what they can do to detect enemies in their system which are a threat to them. If you delete local then logged off recons are undetectable. Therefore bots will die to them
---
you been away for the last year? seem to happen every week :)
---
Considering they were on the other side to germany both times that would be the same thing - but go ahead.
---
TIL
---
Grats ya bunch of crazy Finnish madmen!
---
you mean i *shouldnt* keep a few billion in "wartime useless" solo roaming ships in a structure likely to die, risking billions for no gain? hmm. no. this is cowardice, to me, not the only reasonable play. my brain works good.
---
Passive Drake's. Passive gilas be better for your home hole. C4 is gonna be rattles for you guys, again passive. Rr nestors would work for c4 but it's gonna require all three of you to be together and the site times suck a bit due to spawn distance. I do c4 in 2x Nestor and 2x leshak. No one else in Corp does...they c3 or look for c5 sites

Yeah you'd have to find, and arm, about 10k more nerds. Wait haven't we tried this already?

I think the coolest part of it was seeing your pod opened up and getting a sense of "this is a plausible thing." I've always had this disconnect with the character&gt;pod&gt;ship system. Seeing all three parts at scale did a lot to sell the idea for me.
---
Good fight man, keep at it!

Lol ok.

I started out with Remote Rep Dominixes, then moved up to Nestors because refitting was cool. If you don't want to rely on multiple characters you can run a cap stable rattle fit. I don't have any fits on me to paste for you but it's not a bad idea to try your own idea out and work on it as you go.
---
What wormhole? Maybe me and some of my friends could come in and help you out
---
No one here seem to want a sandbox, they want a theme park catered to their interest and call it a sandbox..
---
WOW! I think I just got a NCPL hurfpost post Bingo. Lets see: we're not fighting because of other games, we're only in it for the gudfights, we're not fighting because of blueballs, we're not fighting because of blobs, we're not fighting because our leadership ran away from the game after getting dunked, we're not fighting because dirty Goons will DDoS (however the fuck that even works?). Too bad CCP took away the "we're not fighting because of the Alliance Tournament" free spot.
---
BTW, did you know that you can pay for a Russian botnet with spod and moongoo now?
---
Disagree, I’m having fun
---
Are ustz

---
Nestor’s are very common. Remote reps and cap transfers in the highs. You can do C3 and C4 sites with two of them pretty easy, and C5s with 3 Nestors. That’s what I would recommend.
---
eve pve is too fucking boring, hence why people avoid it as much as possible.
---
Its litteraly come and fight me lol jokes we have ecm. I have fcd mallers and anis for over 5 years im not jerking his chain. He picked a slow gimmicky comp to sit on a gate with, so the outcome was a mediocre carcal vs maller fight. Hell the ecm was actually a hindrance because they had no scrams or points to hold anything in place. He is litteraly hyping his own fleet sarcastically in the video.
---
Remove supers.
---
Considering that CCP got rid of the learning skills...
---
Battleships will never be the new titans. Supers/titans get nerfed they will still be used because people will still have them. And the subcap meta in this game is actually in the best spot its been in for years its just been completely ignored and rightly so by the cap meta. 
---
The subcap meta isn't even close to N+1 many groups will engage 30%+ out numbered as there are still opportunities for the better flown side to come out victorious. That is simply not the case with large scale cap fights where tidi and mechanics mean N+1 wins 99% of the time and the risks involved mean fighting out numbered doesn't make sense.
---
So all of those years when PLs MO was to drop 200 titans and supers anytime more than 4 rifters were camping a gate...?
---
But I do agree with the money sucking assholes part.
---
I rented a c6 from hard knocks and grind sites with leshaks. I’ve been swimming in isk ever since and can afford at least 3 injectors a week!
---
Yup, and for some reason I'm still playing this shitty game, probably for its entire life spam
---
Halp I'm upvoting goons what do
---
You say that like nobody in EVE PvE's which is just not the case at all.
---
Like I said, there are plenty of people who enjoy industry, mining, etc. and if you're alliance doesn't have any already that significantly disadvantages your group as it should.  
---
It shouldn't be remotely difficult for large sov-holding entities like NC or PL to attract industrialist corps if they put any effort at all into it and had a culture to which the very idea of building something wasn't anathema.
---
If only you could tether a citadel to a citadel.
---
So people doing something gimmicky and not bog standard meta just makes it stupid? This isn't a CTA fleet to defend a home system, it's screwing around with randoms and seeing what happens.
---
What’s fun about a one sided fight?
---
&gt; Not too sure

Mission accomplished ;)

&gt; We‘ve recently spent a lot of time looking at Rogue Drones, and ultimately decided to add bounties to their heads.  To keep things balanced, the drones will stop dropping alloys, but instead they will have sizable bounties for any pilot who dares hunt them down.  The bounties will keep Rogue Drones as a viable target but will also give the nullsec miners some love, making mining in nullsec a dangerous but valuable profession once more.

If you are not allied with 70-75% of the active player base you can have fun content fighting people whenever you want pretty easily. Otherwise expect blue balls whenever the other 25-30% doesn't feel like feeding to you.

I have to admit Horde leadership has been pretty good at stirring the koolaid for their line members lately.

and?
---
The moment that happens the very core of what makes ncpl different from other alliances die. If you can understand that concept, then you know why it doesnt happen or wont happen. Its not that "leet zkill" but rather "i have better things to do than mine "  Might as well legalize bots, maybe that will bring back from the dead small "leet" groups since pve is boring and doesnt look like it will be made fun any time soon. The fact that you can only get good fights reliably in 2 regions is also a factor that concluded in this shit.

I know that some missions will give you an item called "A lot of money" for use during the mission.

One of the WoW expansions, Mists of Pandaria added the panda race and monk job.  I think he was trying to make a joke of this like the whole WoW community was over pandas.
---
You're the one that's being dumb. your figure of 65k has been padded with everything possible. Your 16k has been taken as low as it can possibly be. You were only ever outnumbered by 4x after you had buckled and refused to form anything but interceptors. In an actual fleet fight and an actual form up, the odds were still against you, but roughly 2 to 1.
---
And neither of those figures has ANYTHING to do with the actual balance of power. It's just something the CFC made up to justify their loss.
---
But you propagate the goon propaganda and drink deep from the fountain of kool-aid. You can keep doing that, but it doesn't have anything to do with the real world.
---
And neither does this discussion, so I'm done with it.

So it sounds like you do have fucks to give?

Was Eve ever a text based web game called Planetarium? I used to play it in the late 90s/early 2000s and thought it might be where Eve started.
---
They just give out items to new players randomly - I had a GM do something similar on my role playing alt. It has nothing to do with what you did or did not receive. It was not a cover up of some other issue.
---
&gt; The ccp don't have money to do the proper problem tickets solving.
---
It's not that they don't have the money for it, but oh noes.
---
&gt; And at that day I submitted a ticket to eve support to help me with my problem.
---
(Should I say that I did not received any reply)
---
And is it marked as read / something similar, or still pending?
---
You know that the GM that contacted you might not even have anything to do with answering / fixing tickets like that?
---
There's some spod waiting for me back in the old homestead.

I actually tracked down a surviving copy of the physical box set just for the new stuff.  Then the code didn't work completely.  CCP eventually gave me all the shiny stuff though.  There were some replacements iirc, like new style plex.
---
meme: yes all of our supers are still hellcamped in 93pi
---
truth: we have a keepstar in jump range of 93pi
---
reality: some people who won eve probably have things logged off in 93pi, and many folks who have returned to the game have successfully evac'd assets from the north post-eviction
---
there's this thing called survivorship bias.

Yup every goon titan is trapped there. [Ignore this](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QW5np8g6klE/maxresdefault.jpg), fake news

The war for Vale was fought in Tribute, once Test and Co2 had lost Tribute it meant we had lost Vale too.
---
If you're getting started in abyssals you can try something like this: https://zkillboard.com/kill/76670834/ pretty cheap and will run t1-t3 gamma filaments pretty easy. If the gila feels a bit much this should feel just about right.
---
Not much, but most fights are pretty one-sided, as they should be if you are competent in picking the right targets.
---
I think you're mistaken. While NC thinks Unspoken is a giant Pita, I think there's plenty of respect for Unspoken.
---
Yeah so why make and edit this long video for a meh fight. Im not saying stick to the meta or dont stick ya dick in a beehive. Im asking why did this require a 30 minute long video. Fuck listening to a mid tier FC chase people around nullsec for 30 minutes.

CCP idea of the event was that Serpentis steal Iapetan but lose it along the way to capsulers, but players instead decided to escort it back to Serpentis space!

That didn't actually happen, the only alliance that helped was BoB. Even if other people did want to help it didn't matter the event staff/devs shot them anyway. Saying the above just sounds better then "devs helping bob cheat more".

Haven't seen anyone complaining, except goons that they won't get to drop their 1,000 titans on a Keepstar grid and press DD 5 times over 12 hours.

Suit, you set the bar wayyyyyy to high for the rest of the CSM dude. We really don’t deserve you and all the effort you put into our beloved game and community.

CCP should really put you on the payroll.
---
I like how, when presented with an actual list of characters and alliances involved in the conflict, you scream "kool-aid." What hard numbers have you brought to the table? Hint: it's nothing. You've provided no evidence to back up anything you've said. All you've done is tell me about vague feelings that you and yours have used to justify your "elite" image, to make it feel like you've accomplished something other than riding along on a conflict for which you were barely involved or even moderately adjacent. 
---
If you want to actually prove a point, let's see some numbers or other data. Figures that are at least or more detailed than the ones I provided earlier. If you can't do at least that, then this discussion is indeed over, and I'll trust you not to stink up the internet with your foul feelings-based "arguments."
---
The code of conduct is already up: https://community.eveonline.com/community/csm/
---
You appear to be of the opinion that individual members of the CSM cannot talk to the community at large. Some of us do. Other don't want to. Adding a chairman position wouldn't change that last bit. And it wouldn't improve the first.
---
Didnt take long to get posted lol. Considering it was/is a goon squad deployed they sure are biting into the goon invasion meme, then again their 'allies' look to be giving up on their own krablands. I wont go into details about the war because in all honesty i want BoT back to the good old days, now its all "Dont fly anything expensive" and really cringey hashtags. #keepcalmandcarryonrenting

Move doomsdays day's from titans to dreads, hear me out. 
---
First of all the whole AOE thing just delete that because honestly 1 person is having fun when bosoning a fleet that's the titan pilot. 
---
Second the anti cap doomsday seem to fit dreads perfectly the drop in delete a cap and die ( make them siege to doomsday ), you might even want to up the alpha so like 5/6 dreads can delete a super. 
---
Titans have the job as fleet support ships mostly to bridge people around. 
---
Faxes can still form capital sized logistics role, to back up carriers/supers or to back a subcap fleet. 
---
Anti-subcap weapons can be removed from dreads as it's well not there job anymore and there not useless against capitals under faxes because of there massive doomsday alpha. 
---
Carriers now can deal with subcaps but have way more of a risk as people can cyno in 5/10 dreads delete the super and be happy about the trade.

I can tell you why it wouldn't be released as a CD. Because most of us no longer have a CD drive!! It's like a relic of the past. Those who owns a CD drive also owns a VHS machine somewhere in the attic.

Get a grip. M-O had peak concurrent people of 5k in the system. 7k characters visited in total.
---
You're using numbers that suit you and even skewing those towards a favourable direction. It's quite sad tbh.
---
And 65k "involved" in the conflict? You are daft.

That's the real issue. It's not about liking one alliance or the other but total domination of one or two mega coalitions.  They will spam supers and Titans and the rest can sit in high sec if they are lucky enough. Even low sec isn't safe as we see with snuff. 
---
That's gonna be a very boring game in the long run.
---
I think they have to because at this point if GSF makes the decision test isn't worth defending they will quickly get removed, so yes if goons tell test to jump well they really don't have a choice but to do so.

Joined Red Frog Freight n ran every contract I could as to not waste any jumps. Going trade hub to tradehub with courier contracts.

After a while you start making great isk just trading and courioring.

What part of "the full force of the MBC hadn't even assembled when M-O happened" are you failing to grasp? There were four months of conflict after M-O. Let M-O go.

This is a a good counterpoint I would like to see addressed before I fully agree with Suitonia here.  Less safe crabbing in null is a net positive for the game, but if accessibility were even across the board then the incentive to take and hold less accessible space would be gone.

As it stands the only real reason for invasion is for fun or ego, and the new cyno jammers and TZ-tanked citadel spam have removed the fun.

&gt;As the deadline passed it was apparent that Damned Brotherhood had not shot any B0T members nor their sov and instead had openly started entosising Quiet Lazer sov in spire and shooting their entosis ships attacking the B0T sov. Little did everyone know was that Damned Brotherhood had sent us all the chat logs about this deal and we told them to agree to it. This was only known to a few people in NC and myself and the Damned brotherhood group. Doing this allowed Damned to switch their timers to the EUTZ where we were actually able to assist them in defending their structures. So the person in charge of this idea from goons got played hard and made boat look like a moron.

as I said before he made it because he fuckin wanted to. He didn't do it to pleasure you, he didn't do it for any reason other than this thing called F U N, so how about you get over yourself.

half and half would be my guess based on coms chatter during fleets, there were people ready for it to end and people who wanted to keep going

Meanwhile Malpais had an 81% reduction in mining amount and a 48% decrease in bounties going from March to April. And to think they're still paying rent for that

???? almost every entity that was shooting test in the doomchinchila crack pipe days was because of test's blue in the first place, xix, and none of them were there to do sov shit, that was just PL. You had tri and skillu "there" because of their conflict with xix and nothing else. Other than those and nc who else was shooting test? black legion? lmao. Also at that time skillu wasn't even a &gt;1k toon alliance, and tri had like 2k?
---
oh yeah and it goes without saying that this is pretty rich coming from tapi.

&gt;You interfered in Legacy vs Winter Co 1v1

you guys need to make up your mind, are they dead and irrelevant or are they so powerful their ~100 man(in a good day, with nc.) subcap fleet that needs to burn half the galaxy to get there made any difference?

where is he "bitching"?

Ban everyone related to you.  It's only one *thing* and covers you, your nan, and everyone in-between.  But then you discover your dad isn't banned and suddenly many questions are raised.
---
You do realize that if NC/PL pulls out of sov that leaves like 1 group left for GSF to fight right ?
---
You're recommending scorched earth, when the only reason the enemy is coming is in order to scorch your earth. Smort.
---
Yeah, the correct move is to cloak and then MWD within the same tick, and that's what I generally do. But there is that extra grace time if you want to see you cloaked up before pressing the MWD button (and sometimes if I'm in a ship where I need to be careful I'll do that).

That was quite literally a myth.  But good on you for believing it I guess, the people that crafted that particular myth are probably pretty happy.

eh goons would have to be the ones doing the removing.  Some of the weaker legacy members could be picked off by some of the others in panfam or otherwise but test to be deleted will require goons proper to do the heavy lifting of eso/feyth/paragon soul.  
---
It’s not like all goons have to do is say “go delete test we won’t stop you”   Goons would have to do the work and it would be a heavy lift.  Probably would be the only true challenge.  It would be like the USA military invading the nato countries.  Possible sure but costly on all sides.
---
I just got that this morning, GM messaged my newly created alpha and gave me a venture + skin ; corpmate said he had similar happen about 1 year ago
---
\*that sad face you make when you felt you were about to post a good pun, but its already in the comments\*
---
Seriously, I've never gotten a dime for my propaganda videos
---
What was 'skynet'?  Was out of the game from '11 to '18.
---
This poor kid doesn't understand he is the reason EvE is shit.  
---
"You are literally the cancer that is killing this game!"
---
We should hire someone to follow him around and say this to him everytime he does something he feels is significant.
---
Skill injectors are probably the worst change CCP made since Incarna
---
That's when you say, "Came here for this, was not disappoint!"
---
This really shows that there needs to be some NPC Null space in Dronelands and in the South West - give bot hating players a neutral staging area and they’ll happily help CCP fight the bot menace.
---
300 minutes in TIDI.
---
And what do you do with the ppl who have supers? Just say bad luck sucker?
---
You guys did this shit to people long before goons did, so fuck off.
---
&gt; the Casino War
---
lol
---
It's not for everyone, but lots of the fun is just being rewarded for long-term projects and work, it's basically a hobby rather than a game and I really don't blame you if you can't get into it, it's just not everybody's thing. :)
---
You don’t understand the term scorched earth do you
---
Actually they were fighting with similar numbers just had supers and knew how to use them. PL was never the blue the whole game to win group. So fuck off retard
---
Lol...not me.  
---
Never not play defense when you don’t really have the tools to play offense against the enemies strategy.  
---
I, for one, am hopeful that they can put together an interesting and fun defense.  Admittedly though they have put themselves in a tough position.
---
Because more n+1 or making supers totally useless is the solution here.
---
we don't need more space and have no issues with our legacy neighbours - goons just aren't starting a war with test
---
Yeah, works for J space (blue loot), works for FW (tags), works for DED (Overseer's Effects) - why not for rats, at least outside CONCORD's purview (i.e. in null)?
---
It's not so much about botting - a bot can drop an MTU I'm sure - but it means that if you're a nervous nancy and warp out as soon as someone touches local, you'll be leaving a site's worth of loot in that MTU and so hunting might actually be worth something.
---
I mean sorta like because all the eve timers are well shit for everyone ( as the more shit the timer the more the defender benefits ), going preemptively hey guy's where not fighting any timers, is a lot less painful then forming at god known what early hour of the morning just to stand down.
---
Sticking an NPC space in deep null isn't going to make the space the equivalent of HS/LS-adjacent space for roaming purposes - it's still fucking far - but it will help concerted hunters.
---
This GM is likely contacting you as part of ou being a new player, not due to your ticket.
---
They reach out to new players to see how they're settling in.
---
If it's still marked as open that means the ticket hasn't been resolved yet.
---
I remember that you could drag it but nothing would happen after you enter the number. It just fizzled. I do know what you're talking about though.
---
How are you going to even try and blame smallgangers for the carrier rebalance? What the fuck are you smoking?
---
He must have found it in the near mythical CCP Crystal Quarry relic site!
---
Killing ihubs is real easy though if the opposition has withdrawn all of their structures and staging points.
---
I for one welcome our new Triglavian overlords and am willing to produce ships for the cause!  
---
Edit: I kinda also want to see what would happen if the Triglavians were available for a starting race
---
You could assign carrier fighters to fleetmates and the fighters would assist the fleetmate in combat. So this allowed the carrier or supercarrier pilot to sit just outside of pos shields in relative safety and apply dps to any grid in system
---
Constellation maybe even?
---
not into porpaganda but im doin fleet pvp videos and i try to do them visually pleasing  
---
so i need a few hours for every fight, never got a dime as well
---
He was talking about the 2nd largest coalition headed by TEST last seen sucking Goon dick.
---
Not really most of Panfam likely realized this was a reality already, given most of the line members are there for winning fights not for sov well it's likely they don't particular care about losing the space, i mean i can see this hurting horde but really nc/pl is likely gonna be fine like anybody still left in those groups really isn't there for the great ratting space.
---
Can't tell if trolling or really really stupid.
---
It's so bad they are mining regular belts with procurer fleets.
---
Another satisfied customer
---
Omfg big oof
---
Fit?
---
&gt; and the new **cyno jammers** and **TZ-tanked** **citadel spam** have removed the fun.
---
You pretty much nailed 1, 2 and 3 right there in your last sentence.
---
"Waterboarding is a thing I promise you and it will be aids to a super fleet trying to take a regional gate." good luck with that plan
---
it says 10%, but in heavy tidi, it is way lower
---
Why can’t I be both! Don’t limit my potential!
---
When was the last time CCP added new systems? I'd really love to see this done but it feels like something they won't do anymore.
---
Ok thanks. Didn't know it worked like that.
---
I don't really understand this position. If you've lost something, it doesn't matter if you self-destructed it or if someone else shot it.
---
This deserves gold.
---
There is a Chinese Proverb that says beat your enemy without  putting  their blood on ur sword. Goons just did that.
---
third partying refers to the practice of a combatant coming in as a third party (not taking a side) fyi
---
The propaganda video has already been memed:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=155&amp;v=CfF5t7ezuDU
---
#HI          
---
Don't forget about linking Paragon Soul dead end to Stain.        
---
Ty
---
Must be online or stront won't do anything.
---
Nah im good this was boring.
---
i mean they did say it would be a longterm thing rather than a campaign iirc
---
If only C6 would have a second static.
---
Basically like drone assist, except limited to 5 (fighters were basically really big drones back then) and they appeared in your drone window and could be actively controlled by you this way. You also could be literally anywhere in system while the carrier could ALSO be literally anywhere in system....  
---
Now imagine gatecamping with the firepower of a carrier/super except the only ship on grid is a super fast tackle it tomorrow. They were relatively 'eh' as old fighters were much more balanced.... until drone mods started working on them. Since your carrier was safely parked just outside POS shields (almost safer than being @0 on a Citadel) you didn't need to fit any tank. Suddenly you had carriers assigning fighters that had like 1k dps apiece with perfect application that went 10km+/second. The most famous example is this (check his kills too): https://zkillboard.com/kill/44917133/
---
Super broken.
---
Now please do something about it.
---
Note: NPC Null ought to have at least 1 station system which is in jump range of another NPC-held system, so that logistics is remotely possible.
---
Fake, Lady Scarlet's English isn't this good
---
ratting in a vni
---
then running 10/10s that they dropped when i was good enough
---
One step closer to becoming the serenity server.
---
There's 2 systems in all of Outer Ring that are NPC, and it isn't even a large region.
---
That could be precedent for adding others, i.e. doesn't have to be a lot, just a 'remote outpost'.
---
I could even see corps like say Imperial Armaments, Kaalakiota, CreoDron, etc., having a 'top-secret research outpost' in the middle of nowhere, if lore reasons are needed.
---
&gt; when snuff undocked 14, I repeat, 14 nightmares ncpl left the field and went home, like wtf?
---
When any one of them can cyno in an entire batphone capital fleet, it isn't really '14 nightmares'. And that's why cynos are not only bad for small gang players, but also for any PVP players who don't want to take on a full scale capital escalation at any given fight.
---
I have and will keep voting for him every year he runs. The wisest CSM that we have. I tell my corp to vote for him too. Love you Suit
---
This was my goal but it's nice to see I will have help.
---
This seems to be true, yes.  More like 1%.
---
Reee why would you expect me to stand and fight when I can run and hide.
---
We have a huge problem with having too much space. Our player count is spread too thin
---
Nearly, the germans had better weapons in some regards but the french military was regarded as the best by many historians at the time.
---
Yes, you can use Abyssal Filaments in wormholes. Wormhole system effects do not apply though, since you are effectively traveling to another system with its own environmental effects.
---
Don't forget you could assign fighters to "attack" someone and they would follow them anywhere in the system, even safes until you recalled them or they left system.
---
that hurts to read
---
the repetitive and endless grind to get a billion isk in 2004/5 by doing lvl 3 missions makes me think that you either have some sort of autism or you are insane because no functioning human would ever subject themselves to that lol
---
As far as long term projects and such, the fact that ISK can be bought with real money ruined it for me. In most games the grind is fun especially for rare resources. But in Eve every relic, every rare ore, there’s nothing you can find that can’t simply be bought. Usually easily and for quite cheap. I bought $40 of PLEX and it made any ISK activities I did basically meaningless. 
---
I also didn’t like how the skills were time based. I needed 30 days on Omega to be able to fly anything decent, and I’m still waiting. Nothing I do can speed it up besides buy injectors I guess. 
---
Also it’s just SO slow. Damn it’s slow haha. Oh well, I gave it a good shot.
---
A option to be (if not allied with them) neutral with them and for exemple have some limited economic stuff  to do for them. like mining the special ore and bring it to the arc  for abyssal material's would be fun.atm all interactions with "new " Races / Factions was go there shoot them good. this gets boring fast .
---
hell it might even fit the lore , because as far i understand the Triglavians wageing war against drifters and sansha. so why not help the enemy of my enemy's ?
---
You underestimate my autism when free kills are involved. I spent an hour to kill a VNI bot once.
---
If only they had more allies... Oh wait.
---
Same with all of the exploration bots.
---
Backing up your arguments with neatly formatted data and images. This is a good post.     
---
However, it would be difficult to get the groups that live in those regions to get on board with losing their sov in the name of creating an NPC region.    
---
How about creating a new single-constellation NPC region to fit that spot LY and jump range wise? Stargate connections could be added accordingly as well. It would fulfill the criteria of (1) shaking up null (2) not evicting existing sov holders (3) CCP being able to advertise some new feature/expansion.    
---
Lore-wise we could say the various pirate factions secretly colonized new territory and have now opened it up to capsuleers for whatever reason.
---
That would be revolutionary
---
I'll take a titan off your hands. I don't have one yet. :(
---
This x1000, Hilmar is a fucking moron.
---
It doesn't matter how many frigs, cruisers, or battleships there are in the game. It's time caps and supers were treated the same way, and stop being balanced around scarcity. It's clear they need a role change.
---
\&gt;  No one wants 1k battles that lasts for 14 hours.   
---
I do
---
Not in 04
---
Why would them?  
---
Goons will drop like 4x more titans and the war is all about N+1
---
The Drone Regions were a mistake
---
bots most certainly can salvage AND loot. combine this concept with super simple mini-game/captcha-activity to open and now you are talking. might have to make mobile tractors not loot, would just tractor. this logic could be effective for multiple bot vulnerable activities.
---
Haha okay :p ty
---
Didn’t know that
---
Great post Suitonia, I had been hoping for more NPC regions for years, especially one in the Drone Lands. I doubt CCP will ever do something as large as adding another region anytime soon though. One can hope.
---
I could be wrong but I don't think he is running again this year.
---
Sold plex &gt; used earnings to start buying cheap caps and moving to better markets &gt; graduated to buying cheap supers and moving to alliance market for a markup. Sadly my margins are dead at this point thanks to the mass super sell off after the anom and application nerf. 
---
But I have more isk than I know what to do with at this point so it's not really a big deal. You get to a point where it's like "do I actually need more isk?"
---
some dude already replied to the economical aspect so yeah just stick with his response but now let's get to this:
---
&gt;You're asserting that everyone in a leadership role in that war were slobbering retards. That Elo Knight, Doomchinchilla, Vince Draken, whoever lead SkillU, and whoever lead CENTI were all fucking retarded and had no idea how citadel mechanics work. Given how I've never heard of you before, I'm inclined to think you're the moron instead.
---
no i'm not, literally the only entity there trying to "evict" you was pl. NC. were doing nc. things, skillu and tri showed up to big timers(not sov shit mind you, but stuff like ualx) *exactly because tapi decided to help xix against them and later house them*, and that was way before doom even called for the deployment. CENTI was a small alliance trying to wage a defensive war to survive in the area, they weren't trying to evict you(im assuming you're tapi here). Also not knowing who runs the biggest sov holding alliance in the game is a nice meme. No, they were not all retards, but then again the only one who was actually trying to evict you was pl.
---
&gt; Oh, and you're asserting that none of those mil leads knew that they could just blueball major fights until Goonswarm's supercapital fleet stopped answering our batphones for fights that were like six goddamn jumps out of their staging. Which is a thing that would have taken all of a handful of blueball ops with waterboarding to accomplish. 
---
the moment you deploy hostile supers to a keep grid and tidi kicks in you can literally just ping and they'll have plenty of time to form and move. That's what nc supers and goon supers did in ualx, the problem with titan brawls isn't the structure, *any* structure that houses a titan blob brawl will die regardless, it takes just a few titans to keep it damage capped lmao. The timer itself is meaningless.
---
&gt; It was morale that won the war in the south. If the attackers had any willingness whatsoever to keep fighting a war that wasn't a slam dunk, then they could have taken several regions from us, minimum. 
---
i want you to take a look at salt farmers, like 20 nerds, and brave gave up on trying to evict them solely due to citadel mechanics, while they're are on *brave's own* sov, and in range of their supers/caps. Now imagine trying to do that with an alliance of your size(which includes brave), on your own sov, with your supers dockable in range, and only just pl with their supers deployed and trying to evict you. You gotta stop drinking that koolaid bud, there is a reason you stopped the offensive war against winter co like 3 weeks in.
---
 u/suitonia  say it ain’t so?
---
The second largest coalition would still lose even if they did fight.
---
Not to be the super creepy neck beard.... But visitable brothels
---
Similar to your posting history
---
Did they change it so tidi affects drugs now?
---
PBUH
---
Officially no, but I can tell you it has helped me get through some tough weeks
---
This is some top shit holy hell, couldnt stop laughing! I hope we have a nice bunch of brawls in geminate if you guys decide to invade this most wonderful region, o7
---
Holy shit man
---
To tag on to this idea, the fact that the amount of anomalies doesnt deplete the more you run the sites is a problem. The increased respawn time is a first step, but it could be taken further. The more you complete a certain type of site, say havens, the less actually show up. 
---
Taking this further, the more you run sites, the more diamond rats infest your system. In addition to them showing up on gates, anf in ore belts, have them appear in anomalies. This could be a random patrol or it could be part of the spawn system. These rats have tackle and remote reps so defeating even a small group in a botting vni is unlikely. 
---
You could take that even further. Make the diamond rats mine out ore anomalies in addition to the normal belts. The more combat anomalies you run, the more mining fleets they send. You gotta have materials to build all those ships you're losing. 
---
If the ai is enhanced this way, the botting regions will become absolutely swarmed with diamond rats. It would make running anomalies in those systems nearly impossible unless you are working with people. 
---
Bonus: this would affect delve. And other alliance heavy places.
---
Have you tried not dropping 10 titans on a cruiser fleet?
---
You made me question myself, so I went and looked it up. From Wikipedia:
---
&gt;A scorched-earth policy is a military strategy that aims to destroy anything that might be useful to the enemy while it is advancing through or withdrawing from a location. Any assets that could be used by the enemy may be targeted, for example food sources, water supplies, transportation, communications, industrial resources, and even the local people themselves.
---
To start with, this isn't applicable at all in EVE, since the enemy can't make use of your infrastructure even after conquering your land, and by infrastructure I mostly mean upwell structures, the assets inside them, and SOV upgrades. So there's no reason to "destroy anything that might be useful to the enemy", since none of it is useful to them. 
---
Furthermore, if the enemy's primary objective is to destroy everything you own (as is the case in most conflicts in EVE), in other words, 'to scorch your earth', so to speak, then doing it yourself before they even show up is not a good strategy. The term is perfectly applicable here. If there's something I'm missing, please feel free to elaborate.
---
Keep clickin’, money rollin’...
---
I settled in Arctic Light's ancestral class6 a few years ago before a joined TEST. Started bashing their POCOs and they had someone logged off in the system, he brought in his friends and killed us. Only 3 of us. We worked out a plan and they let us live in that system. Cool guys.
---
Not the whole game, just the winning side
---
you would have to split up the coalition in a large number of groups to get down to the number of real ppl that's in NC/PL.. hell i'm sure many sigs in imperium has more real ppl then NC/PL
---
Good question.  I don't know/can't remember.
---
yes fucking please. The drone one alone would be a great content generator for a lot of regions
---
Adding NPC stations. I love you Suitonia. Full homo.
---
fuckin Karens
---
most super pilots in NC/PL is from before the age of keepstars so might not be a massive issue
---
Cyno module requires 1337 capacitor to activate.
---
lel pls no eve already feels empty without adding more systems
---
Omg, realized that actually I am shoving bad behavior. Anyway who's got the same problem with skillpoints, how did you solved that?
---
Naz deserves a pulitzer prize.
---
Unironically yes. Dronebro btw.
---
You are correct. What I meant to say was whoring on the winning side.
---
Can we vote for him without him even running?
---
Suitonia back at it again reminding us what a good csm is like
---
Flown with yall before,great group and i hope you have many years of wormholling ahead of you!
---
"Baaah" means "yes daddy"
---
I used to run marathons.  Just because I used to doesn't mean I'm going to like to  do that or able to in the present.
---
If skillpoints and budget are a concern, look into the Praxis battleship.
---
Remove teneferis, Detroit, outer passage and the spire.
---
Don't need those groups on board. Should be their punishment for encouraging rampant botting.
---
(pbuh)
---
like it? no prob not.. but it's either that or uninstall.. rather roam in it..
---
with all 5s That tanks 1849 with mid-grade crystals (no Omega).  Which means you can really only do 2-3 sites and have to kill the towers.
---
I would offer this alternative which can do all the green sites plus relic and data and is 2-300M cheaper.   
---
This does 60 less DPS and, with mid-grade crystals (No Omega) but can tank 3314 effectively doing all sites and you can ignore all towers which should make up for the DPS.
---
The other half of the pair is set  up the same but drops the  Invul II in favor of a Paint, and upgrades the Pith C Adaptive Invuln to a Pith B.   it only tanks 2745 BUT if the other rattle "moves first" in the site the towers will never switch so it's fine.

&gt; Also Hello to goons and the the rest of eve when this gets leaked. 
---
O7
---
The question is how many of their pilots are now multi-tasked now that they don't have to be dedicated super holding or super using characters.
---
Pretending 5x super advantage isn't blobbing by suggesting raw numbers mean anything. Classic.
---
&gt;drank some Gatorade mixed with sauerkraut
---
The thought of those two mixed kinda makes me want to puke.
---
Why not just tell the alliances that are in that space that have bots banned that the space is now claimed by jove since they harbored bots since the beginning of Eve ..
---
They are unanchoring the structures not destroying them. So when goons come up there’s nothing to destroy, well my best guess is that there will still be a few structures there but fewer and more manageable to defend. Like when the vikings invaded England the English army moved everyone into fortified cites with nothing outside and scorched the earth outside so the Vikings had nothing to take
---
Hyperbolic liberty aside, you guys did drop supers on anything that moved. Hell, I had 3 PL Nyxes and a dozen Thanatos dropped on a 6 man lowsec gate camp once, so i would put the myth of the PL 200 super hot drop right up there with the myth of PL being in it "for the gudfights".
---
Smartbombs make a good difference for not having to target frigates or apply to them with Geckos. I went for a little more expense and the max isk/hr route. Ofc you can do your own risk analysis.
---
Get a load of the amateur over here
---
Weird, we lost a LOT of wars to sheer numbers over the years despite that super advantage, its almost like numbers DO matter but you're led by incompetent idiots who bungle every advantage they get
---
Remove Delve
---
No not useless but having a counter.  Hacs used to be counters for bs.  Assault frigates in the right numbers could counter cruisers.  Having a ship one size smaller as a counter was good game design.
---
You can’t balance supers by making them more powerful and it’s bad design to make them useless, but there is a design space for a super cap counter.  In sufficient numbers dreads used to be that, but it no longer works
---
but there is no botting in goons space only panfam i thought?
---
Are these structures being offered as payment to not invade?
---
Never drink the hot dog water...
---
But we only use titans when we batphone init and goons
---
What could I have done to make it less boring for you?
---
Yeah I was rethinking my reply after posting it and realized what you meant, and I get that perspective.
---
issue is that there isn't enough pilots in game left over.. you can change leadership all you want, but with out some of goons allies flipping on them, there isn't enough ppl to contest.. well.. maby.. let's see what the serenity players coming over can do.. but beside that there's to few ppl in game to contest goons at this point
---
Thats debateable
---
God damnit, I lost it at " May I Speak To Your Manager haircut".
---
Should have been Flavor Aid instead of Gatorade.
---
Having a salvaging bot use an MTU is trivial. so would be looting wrecks as they get pulled in.
---
Have you ever been to Delve?
---
I mean we've lobbied for this in multiple summits and to individual CCPers at meals/bars for years, I don't know what more you expect us to do other than post it to you guys at this point.
---
It might be loosely based off that, but no
---
Yes to more NPC regions/station EVERYWHERE.
---
With the low player count, lets rather remove these "bot" regions for now.
---
Your problem is not understanding the systems in PL and that leading you to believe some dumb pubbies whiney shit.
---
If you see 200 supers, that is PL dropping supers on you.
---
If you see 3 nyxes drop on you, thats some bored retard just flinging  his shit around.  The freedom to do that was one of the draws to super pilots around EVE for years, if you want to, and can without looking like an idiot, you're free to.  
---
In the same way that "anybody" can run up a roam in any normal alliance, it used to be that "anybody" can drop shit in their super without having to ask permission or make it some super strat op to do so.
---
The alliance itself very rarely waved its supers around, simply because for many years they were literally just a paper tiger that if properly addressed, would be a smoking heap because there wasn't any back up.
---
Many times when we did wave them, we got fucked up.  Y-, the other Y-, VFK, B-R.  It was always shocking how many times we'd set them down to fight and get fucked up but you wake up the next day and people are still terrified so you keep on with it.
---
Perception is everything I guess, and PL's superfleet has always been perceived to be a greater threat than it actually was.
---
I'm pretty confident in Horde giving us some decent fights. Your NCPL overlords... well we've already seen how determined they are to undock.
---
It's goonswarm owned, yes. But it's not "Goon space." 
---
It's their renter's space.
---
No, TIDI does not affect drug duration.
---
Sure, with the decreased server population we could use less accessible space as well to drive conflict.
---
This is pretty much a classic "low number of pirates causes climate change" argument.
---
The main driver of botting is RMT, and the main driver of RMT is real world economics. That's why frat space is full of bots even though it's close to two NPC regions, and why Geminate was full of bots when it was owned by XiX pets, despite having NPC space and being in range of lowsec. Same with Period Basis. 
---
Botting will always be most prevalent in alliances and groups connected to irl communities where relative income levels make RMT (and therefore botting) worthwhile. A pretty good example is Branch, which since being populated by Chinese and Russian players has become an isk pump. As long as the economic disparity exists, those groups will always be the ones who bot the most. And there are no prizes for guessing which communities they are predominantly selling to.
---
Implying that doesn't happen?
---
I also agree with using Nestors since you can also use them in C5s if you get a connection and scout well.
---
Think about structures, get yourself an Astrahus if you're living out of a Raitaru now. Get a salvaging ship of some kind. Make sure everyone has their own scanning ships and get alts if possible, and get them a scanning ship as well if everyone gets podded out.
---
If you do sub an alt, put them in a sabre as soon as possible. Or at least have someone able to fly one for defensive and offenive purposes.and get someone skilled into anchoring mobile bubbles since you have a high sec static.
---
Make sure everyone has more than one rolling battleship,and a hic is very nice to have...a rolling cruiser can do the same if you're good about your math.
---
Don't anchor structures with ANY open holes. Keep your hole visibly occupied.
---
This has got to be the best and most constructive suggestion I’ve seen in years.
---
IMO more npc space in combination with making npc space less shitty to live in might help against the oppressiveness of bigger groups vs smaller ones. 
---
Many nullsec groups would gladly live in npc space to get out of the soul crushing sov game if their krabs could make better isk than exploration or lvl 4 missions currently gives.
---
Yeah Goons don't bot. Where is the proof??! These can be just lazy-looking players.
---
Can i have your stuff? Seriously i haven't played enough and would like to get into bigger toys and bigger things in general.
---
and thus was born the fourth stimpire
---
Quiet lazers? Come on man, at least call them QuietHawks or something non shit
---
/u/Ro_Fenrios
---
To add on to this, the inaccessibility of the drone regions to roamers and invaders is one of the few things that makes up for the fact that the space, by and large, sucks in a lot of ways.
---
if there gonna add npc space in the drone regions plz don't just add a random faction.  
---
there are story's off rouge drones  called the lonesome ones going around helping out people in dire times,   
---
illed love to see some kinda off group off these lonesome rogue drones that come to gather to form a proper group that interacts  with us and not just the current random collection off hives.
---
lmao they think 4m plex is expensive back in my day we had 1b plex joy emoji joy emoji
---
Please don’t turn out to be some sort of creepy, awful person, because I need one hero in my life that is just a good person.  You are the hero we need but by far don’t deserve on the csm.
---
Keep up the good work.  We are now getting data on bots
---
Actual beebrain's think like this ...
---
The way they've been releasing that data was dumb and does nothing to actually help the problem of bots, it just makes people feel happy because they get to point at others and say "Hah, you guys have more bots than us!" without actually increasing the amount of bots that are dealt with, or reducing the damage of bots on the health of the game.
---
Pretty sure for k space that was drone lands.  It wouldn’t be bad to add npc space to these regions, and they could likely do it.  Flipping one constellation per region, with a large chunk of cobalt converting would be fun.
---
What is the point of renting if you have to fleet up for PvP? Isn't rent paid so renter can play as they wish? With protection? Instead you are taking rent and then the renter also has to fleet up to protect your rental space that they are paying for? Please explain the rules more clearly.

Scotch and broken promises

Get into exploration and earn hundreds of millions while training into an incursion fit. Since you are new focus on exploring while training into the incursion fit. I recommend doing incursions with warp to me as they accept new players. They have a very cheap Rokh fit that you can get. It will take you a month or more to train into it as an alpha due to large hybrids. Incursions get you 30 million each site, warp to me gets at least 100mil/hour. 
---
After you get some isk in the pocket you can choose to keep flying with warp to me or to move onto another community for better isk/hour. Remember to upgrade your fit as it helps complete sites faster and makes your life easier. Thank CCP for having incursions as an easy isk source.
---
I mean, that's kinda what happens when most of the talent leaves, and any that stuck around got axed with CCP Retarded Decision #1832480234 game failed.
---
The average NC/PL member can make isk just as easy as the average goon member. Especially since they can just put an alt in a goon friendly feeder corp.
---
But if NC/PL have 500 average members who has a titan, and goons have 1000 average members who has a titan, war in eve 2019 makes no sense. 
---
So yes. Numbers is the issue, as it has been for very many years.
---
The downside of dreadnaughts is their heavy guns don’t apply very well to small ships. If you get into good tackle ships like interceptors or assault frigates you can probably keep one tackled for as long as you like. The problem is it can tank a ton of damage so bringing in battleships to kill it means a lot will die. The easiest counter would be bombers but those would require forming an actual fleet and wouldn’t really be a good fight.
---
Please come to PB! It will give Test Renters more to shoot at.
---
They should be one jump and one gate so that logistics is possible but risky.
---
it really would be nice to have a weekly/monthly ytd on botting bans
---
would be nice to be able to name and shame the people who are doing it
---
but then again, with the lines drawn how they are and ccps inaction against bots would it even matter?
---
to pull renting revenue away from others it might just become a way to target which areas to harass to get renting bots to switch landlords
---
Missions are really bad isk for new players sadly. Better to explore than to bust your arse off grinding standings and LP.
---
Thanks for that. I'll give it a try on the test server!
---
You win
---
For a couple of the shots yes.  I'm having trouble capturing smooth video with my crappy I3 processor. So I had to discard quite a bit of other footage.  So I ended up with talwars, caracal, and maybe one other.  
---
Something wrong with talwars?
---
If they add new NPC space it needs to be worth living in. Good missions and LP = people live there. Equally bad LP stores result in shitty NPC space that people rarely use except for small scale deployments; see Geminate, SOE Pure blind.
---
Can’t really complain about big blue donuts while being part of the biggest one yet
---
would have to come with increase in warp speed
---
I like incursions for the talking in casual fleets. It's about as exiting as super ratting, without the need to watch an intel channel.
---
Fair.  
---
As a bit of a min/maxer myself, especially when it comes to site time,  I do wonder does it really change the isk/hr though?  How long are you doing Garrisons?   Seems like I'm doing Garrisons in 23-25 minutes I put my main drone on a larger ship (cruiser/BS) and the drone bunny onto the frigates with the TP.  It's usually a one or two shot.  
---
But def. more APM than the smartbomb and given your set up APM is probably a big component of the equation. 
---
Also into that consideration is, again, the time to shoot towers for site that have them and the ability to run all sites which means you spend less time searching for systems/setting up or, if in a bear hole, setting-up/waiting for sites.   
---
You also said you were using 3 rattles, whereas mine setup is for 2, so I guess you get a good bit of DPS tank too which probably means you are able to run all the green sites no?
---
I like how you think the goal of all players in eve-online the computer game is to collect as many blues for years just so you can outblob and prevent content for 2 weeks during a "war".
---
Lmao.
---
As they are, I agree.  They could have done something interesting with them, maybe they will?  A man can dream.
---
Go to a worm hole for sites. High sec has no value for exploration. You could have gotten 30mil from 1 site instead of that 11.6 mil.
---
You just need a meta change, goonswarm was the same during the Casino meta and lost a war, meta change and they become nullsec top dogs
---
Do crows even have hacking bonuses?
---
"retreat now for victory latter"
---
Or the more you run sites the greater the risk of npc stations themselves from spawning?  Or a wormhole to highsec that lasts weeks?
---
I’m all for new npc space spread more evenly, but it won’t solve the botting problem. The botters exist not because there is isolated space in eve, they exist because there is money to be made botting. Of course the botters are going to choose the best areas to do it. 
---
Branch is full of bots at the moment and most of that is within jump range or &lt;10 gates from venal npc stations. Period basis sits next to stain npc stations. Curse npc stations reach into Detorid. Apart from the drone regions your geography doesn’t match your hypothesis. 
---
TL:DR I’m well keen for npc stations to be added to drone regions or anywhere else, let’s not pretend it will solve botting though
---
They also posted essays daily about how evacuating and not fighting was the greatest strategy because ceasars uncle did it.
---
6/10  
---
Few laughs, but kinda boring.
---
Ok, so let's assume NCPL &amp; co had less number in the last big battle in a titan vs titan battle, less assume the one with the biggest "line member" won the fight. 
---
Thing is, NCPL &amp; co had more numbers in the armor timer for example : https://zkillboard.com/related/30001967/201808011900/
---
+200 member compare to the Imperium, what happened ? They lost because they had less titans 
---
Number doesn't matter (and I just destroy the narrtive "we are fighting the blob")
---
no, they do not. they have nullification and enough midslots to not die to single or dual smartbomb battleship camps, though.
---
&gt;we are never alone
---
Landlord turns up
---
**The first phase of Goon war deployment in works as illustrated by key enemy damage control topics:**
---
&gt;B0T won the actual objective which was the entosis war.
---
Claiming extravagant victories that are either completely wrong or completely irrelevant. "*Our 100 man home defense fleet totally eradicated ooaell's multi-boxing entosis cruier gang after 4 hours and we were able to drop new IHUBs*!"
---
&gt;During this fleet on Talking In Stations Ladyscarlet congratulated the allied fleets...
---
Seeking approval and praise from an otherwise abusive and ineffective leader. "*Lady Scarlet was so proud of how we defended their space, so let's show how much we appreciate her appreciation by sending her billions of isk! Don't forget The Spire systems, we'll get it back... soon.*"
---
&gt;They took a hit on their Insurance payouts but we are dronelands we will just build them cheaper right?
---
Alternative opportunity suggestions to take part in to distract from the reality of homes burning. "*It will totally be super fun and lots of win, the Gewnie tears will be so rewarding!*"
---
&gt;So in the end we are doing great and i want you all to continue doing God’s work.
---
Didn't want an entire region anyway. "*It was only The Spire...*"
---
Da fuck?
---
To many pla bots
---
Needs a robocop down there
---
And what old players saw don't push them to come back, actual players might be tempted to win eve due to the general state od the server
---
when enemies have shipped down to VNIs and Ishtars I swapped to cloaky-camping in Lokis... easy kills.
---
This is very good work.
---
Yeah, I know, but hopefully having my own jump freighter will help get isk to run more alts. Although I picked a bad time to not have liquid isk
---
The 750k are given to you at the conclusion of the tutorial. The venture + skin are unrelated gifts for you being a new player.
---
You have no idea how much money I'd pay to see the Mittani run in a pair of booty shorts.
---
0% GSF.. RRRRIIIIIIGGGGGHHHHHTTTTTT.
---
When space has practically unlimited ore anomalies capable of printing supercapitals, and even a low tier system when fully upgraded is capable of supporting quite a few players for PVE, it's not as bad as it once was.
---
Rorquals were the big change.
---
They rage ping for people to join a ratting fleet so they can get adms up in core systems but ban any ships over 100m isk worth to hope that goons dont drop on them. But goons did anyway.
---
&gt;you can't do shit against bots, you're not ccp.
---
I can convince CCP to change mechanics to make them not worthwhile
---
&gt;to stop bots, you ban them.
---
or make them not viable
---
&gt;it'd be nice if players could do anything about bots, but we can't - it's on ccp.
---
You're right
---
&gt;the suggestion doesn't do anything to address bots, either.
---
All bots operate on local- remove local and they no longer have 99% safety, it goes down.
---
I would like to know how you even managed to do this to yourself. That's so much grind in a shitfit. And it's torpedos too.
---
that's because PL kept fucking them over so they decided that's not going to happen again
---
Sounds like my life ....
---
Thera? IDK who actually lives in Thera anymore but it's a nice transit option. Also those drifter WHs, so 2 WH areas to allow easier travel basically.
---
That is a lot of angry words for saying 3x will always beat 1x in eve 2019.
---
Hey dude! I remember watching you get into the game, years ago, giggling at some of your first videos. It boggles my mind to see what a large influence you've had on the game, and how someone I once saw as a newbie has had such a spectacular parabola. Keep on keeping on.
---
Am I just a slow reader or what? Feels like the text stays on screen way to short. Had to keep pausing.
---
Grath, you are talking to spod brains or dino brains, they have no idea that sub caps do matter.
---
I was able to run all sites. I had the entire hg crystal set on them. Smartbombs did matter quite significantly.
---
It's fine for me. :P
---
Guess I'll have to make it even longer now
---
dunno if calling out frat and prosperity sphere by name for having bots is "inaction" anymore
---
Easy but boring
---
I am not sure what you are trying to say.
---
In eve 2019 large wars are all about titan numbers.
---
If side X has more titans then side Y, X wins. And the other way aruond.
---
Nobody can argue argue against that.
---
Everyone also knows this, so as I am sure we can agree, nobody will engage in titan vs titan warfare if they know they will lose.
---
What part of my answer are you referring to, exactly ?
---
Ah but Harvey, haven’t you heard? There’s never been bots in goons. It’s just NCPLPH that have bots.
---
I pay 3 subs. It's not free by any means. You need to be omega to get the rewards. People calling this free are idiotic.
---
This is bad and you should feel bad
---
Unspoken hasn’t showed up the the majority of timers. We’ve killed forts and ihubs and all we see are goons E-listers.
---
Could not have said it any better myself
---
Good boy monkey.
---
That wasn't the point.
---
Reread the comment chain.
---
There could be a great power to oppose goons, but there is a lack of testicles...
---
Because presently they are with the Fat Bee.
---
get it?
---
Its kind of ironic statement though...a Great Power to oppose Goons.
---
One existed, but Panfam literally cut off its TESTicles and threw them at Fatbees dick just to prove how elite they were.
---
Post WWB the North was ridiculously strong...but PanFam fucked that up, well really NC. and PL did is more accurate. DARK., TEST, CO2, NC., PL, HORDE.  Thats a beefy coalition....but if you cut off the nuts it gets pretty soft.
---
How the fuck did you get that from his description? We have twitch for watching already. He's talking about downloading the client, finding the battle and joining. That has NOTHING to do with watching. Did you even read his quote or are you just bad at reading comprehension?
---
Dude, learn to spell.
---
Let me make sure I understand this:
---
So one of the reasons people wanted to join PL was so that they could dickwave supers around, but PL members dickwaving supers around wasn't PL?
---
That doesn't really make sense.
---
PL fostered an environment that encouraged people to drop supers on anything that moves, and used that environment to recruit.  To retrospectively claim that PL wasn't dropping supers unless it was 200 of them or whatever is disingenuous.
---
That's literally my point. Yet people are advocating for this being a great thing and to deal with it by being a good little monkey and logging in every day. Like we don't have real lives. If the reward was insignificant I wouldn't care, but 1 million SP is one of the highest, if not highest amount they've EVER given out. Even for massive issues.
---
Massive tether chains, just imagine it in its boring glory
---
HG crystals. Yeah that's about a Bil more expensive then.  It's only about 100 hp/sec better tank than midgrades though.  allowing you to tank  1956 vs 1849 
---
Anyway I'm not trying to debate/argue for one of the other I just like to geek out comparing/contrasting fit's/approaches to C5 pve.   
---
Rather amazed at the thought running both of those gangs solo. 
---
Cheers.
---
You trade your time for isk as well. By your logic everything in eve is free. Everything in life is free because you just trade your time for money.
---
&gt; This is pretty much a classic "low number of pirates causes climate change" argument
---
NPC space means you can stage "safely" in remote regions from where you can start to hunt and where you can bring the big guns if you need to, that's the thing that this game has been lacking since caps farming became so prevalent and most roamers switched to wormholes therefor mostly limited to only subcap fleets.
---
Being able to bring the guns everywhere means more opportunities for fights etc...
---
I actually think that would work.  Dreads are stuck for 5 minutes
---
Lol you can get 2 rattles for 2 bill and easily do c4
---
Because maybe 1.2% can generate a tremendous amount of revenue. The player base is also changing so interest today might look different.
---
Yeah as I said everyone's risk analysis to their own. It's just the fit was able to tank all anoms and most data/relic.. I did lose some ships but not pods.
---
I also don't get not shooting the towers as you have to do the drifter afterwards.
---
Hey that's funny because that's what pl has been trying to do the last decade.
---
Join a large Null alliance. Look at their doctrines. Produce T1 rigs for their doctrine ships. Sell them on the market.
---
Rigs are great because the materials to make them are quite small, so are easy to transport. Plus some of the materials drop locally. Set up buy orders for those.
---
The game is ok. 
---
The problem are all the risk-averse winning-team-joiners and walk-the-path-of-least-resistance players it is populated with. Like you, for example...
---
Haha thanks!
---
&gt;The average NC/PL member can make isk just as easy as the average goon member. Especially since they can just put an alt in a goon friendly feeder corp.
---
But if NC/PL have 500 average members who has a titan, and goons have 1000 average members who has a titan, war in eve 2019 makes no sense.
---
So yes. Numbers is the issue, as it has been for very many years
---
NCPL side have more numbers and even more space, you said they could make just "as easy" money "as the average goon member" so why, in a battle where they field more they have less titans ?
---
Answer =&gt; Because their side were pushing a narrative for 3 years where pve and MER were bullshit and laughable, don't you remember those post their leader were making ? "MER means nothing", even after 3 years they struggle to tell their member "get yourself a rorq, once you have one get a second one and so on until your computer can't run more, then get titans" like goonswarm were doing for years (which btw they enjoyed leaking on reddit and making fun of)
---
That's literally all pl does though lmao
---
Yeah pod's only a concern when of getting ganked.  I recently downgraded my Pith Invuln and popped in the Omega which was roughly isk neutral but I more often misclick or otherwise screw up and lose a ship to the site than I do get ganked.
---
I like this proposal. It helps against botting and spreads out super umbrellas
---

Is that you by any chance ? Cause this guy doesn't undock often.
---
Not gonna lie I never knew eve even had any Finnish groups. Cool none the less
---
Fuck those guriatas rats. The new drifters beat them in bullshitness but the drifters are at least passive
---
So what you are saying, in a whole lot of words, is that goons have more titans then PL/NC?
---
And in a war decided by titans, goons + legacy cant lose against NCPL.
---
If so we are in agreement.
---
Im not sure what else you are raging about, reddit posters will reddit post. Not all of us wants to play our computer games in the way Imperium/legacy promotes.
---
If we wanted that, surely we would have just joined imperium or legacy? v0v
---
Exploration and incursions
---
How are Unspoken Alliance structure doing?
---
Remove skill injectors.
---
post it anyway, leaks suck tbh
---
I don't remember it being all that bad, torps and missiles in general were much better back then.
---
This game is amazing, people like you are he problem.   No sympathy from the community for you.
---
and they often have over 100m isk in stuff in them. BUT if you are going to enter a sleeper cache Google it and make sure you know what you are getting into. If you only have a T1 analyser you wont even get thru the front door but will  cause it to despawn so someone else wont get it.
---
I'd be 100% behind this.

---
Arctic Light have always been good dudes. Well fun to fight.

This has happened before, yet goons is still here. Which was MY point.

This. It is really far. I know some hunters are committed, but personally if I see 30+ jumps then nah. I'm good.

Going to see about swapping  1 Remote cap on both rattles for a SMartbomb. it'll fit and only marginally hit cap stability.  
---
Thanks
---
You’re terrible at Reddit, stop been bad!
---
OK but Geminate has NPC space and is in range of lowsec, yet was full of bots until Horde took it over. Frat space is full of bots and is next to 2 NPC regions. Period Basis and Branch are both next to NPC regions.  
---
The common factor is the people living in these regions, not whether they have NPC space or not.
---
Jokes on you, that's what the goon deployment is for. All hail the trig invaders
---
I mean if you are gonna spin the truth, at least make it believable.
---
Goons are getting the bluest of balls.
---
Exactly. I enjoy the time I spend mining as much as I would doing anything else in the game. Maybe more since there’s little risk of loss, income is steady, and I can just hang around bullshitting with friends in a mining fleet and watching Netflix. (Sorry if that was a bit incoherent, caught me at a bad time)

It's funny because he doesn't even log into the game and barely does anything.

You’re elite sweetie

You started up a wh corp I can join yet?

Faction warfare: you can only take systems that are adjacent to friendly systems.

Thus, creating a front line.

If I can't have that.

Replace plexing and ihubs with faction forward operating bases.

Obviously, I'd prefer both.
---
lol, the irony

Nope.  But its going in a positive direction.  Keep in mind some of us have been playing before 'The Report Bot Feature' was introduced.

\*Taps head with finger\* You can't undock if you unanchor all your stations

Quality posting from Suitonia.

---
well there's a whole lot of alliances, both in their coalition, and in delve itself. if there's delve bots, why bot in GSF directly when you could use disposable characters in other alliances?
---
for that matter, you'd have to judge whether it makes sense to even use coalition space at all. that's part of what this is all about. delve, for being the ~spooky umbrella,~ is actually pretty busy. you could just sit a VNI in a system that will see a total of 0 people instead

Remove Providence.
---
what if cyno jammers were deleted entirely
---
Yea, because naming and shaming is gonna stop them. Just like banning the bots prevents them from making a brand new alpha account the next day.
---
Yes I'm a member of BOT, no I'm not a bot and I'll try and make a serious post but I'm gonna assume I'll get shot down or ignored.
---
As someone who lives in dronelands, I disagree.  I always feel this NPC suggestion isnt about helping to tackle BOTs, its more improving the safety of those that do roam in the area and what better way than in a totally invulnerable structure that no-one controls?  Dronelands are already a pain in the arse because its geography allows campers to cover 300+ systems from a single spot, very few, if any, other areas allow that sort of coverage.
---
The way I interpret the map is that the PVP alliances (Goons, NC., Test) generally control the regions nearer to empire:
---
* It simplifies their empire logistics
---
* Allows them to inhibit hostile entities gaining nullsec foothold and disrupting friendly logistics
---
* Permits control of the regions directly behind them
---
Behind the main alliances generally you install the secondary PVP entities, which gives them friendly space and fairly close to any potential front lines.
---
At the back you have the arse end of no-where that's miles away from PVP, logistic routes to empire are long but very few roaming entities tend to survive reaching making the PVE and industry activities more achievable.
---
My suggestion, if you really want to fix the BOT issue, rather creating safe havens for a handful is either:
---
1. Add connections from empire to deeper null sec regions (stabilized wormholes or Triglavian portals?) or
---
2. Change the empire geography by converting the current null regions bordering empire into low sec regions and add in a new new null areas (something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/mVHt2Rh.png) \- orange being low sec regions, blue being new nullsec)
---
The beauty of option two in my eyes is you could ditch current faction warfare and setup proper empire vs pirate faction warfare in those low sec regions to control the region.
---
There is a third option - find away to kill off the super-coalitions, break up the power so smaller entities can grab space and dont have to deal with 500+ titan fleets.
---
Amazing post Naz
---
And here come the tears 😢
---
&gt; For no good reason. 
---
Wellllllllllll it's more that the skins left holes that weren't immediately apparent, like not painting extra bits on T2 hulls, and it's definitely true that it would have caused trouble with the more complex skins they introduced down the road. 
---
The hologram skins are good examples. [They look great on the hulls they're designed for](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/36rZNhRvDqww8s4ayGQC4i/b5519873a42a4a0ff1a6f926bfa815c5/NES-Banner-Image_Screenshot_1920x1080.jpg), but where do you stick a hologram on something like a stilleto?
---
Changing hull colors is easy but they rapidly went beyond that. It's no surprise to me that they killed the bug but I'm disappointed they didn't provide similar functionality for fleet custom hull colors through a proper feature.
---
Snuffed out will be living in tribute
---
My sides status: approaching uranus orbit.
---
CCP back then said there will be no more than few Titans, players prove them wrong
---
Years pass and coalitions have hundreds of them and what CCP does just few years back? Ruin the game with injectors so that people don't even need to wait for them to train all those months and thus fucking up one special thing about this game
---
Even if they remove injectors that ship sailed long ago, now they try and shake up things with Triglavians but I wont jump on incursions 2.0 just yet because they said it is stage 1 so I will just wait and see what happens with that, I am sure they will iterate on this new threat if it goes bad right?
---
This is what every FC promises and those with brains know it is the oldest lie in the game, while 95% of the time it is watching shield going down, then on next day armor and hull timer in a few days. Multiply that by 100 = 'fun'.
---
Aside from the bomb runs, they did little to no damage. We could have got away with just the Rodiva and 1 T1 logo boat.
---
Why didn't they just fight us? I mean, I'll take the 1hr feed, but boy was that annoying to not get a decent fight.
---
&gt;So what you are saying, in a whole lot of words, is that goons have more titans then PL/NC?
---
Wow you got it, but did you get the where I explain why ? Short answer : leadership.
---
&gt;If we wanted that, surely we would have just joined imperium or legacy? v0v

I start eve because of the Imperium, I played Eve because of the Imperium and after 4 years in eve as an Imperium member, I decide few weeks ago to leave for wh space since for me my alliance reach the final goal : we won the current meta, and well having fun to being afraid of 2 Battleship roaming around and not having to press the magic button to drop my titan and supers on it
---
"These aren't the droids you're looking for....."
---
System cyno jammers yes, mobile cyno jammers are a necessity for whaling.
---
Given most of the people complaining about pl's super drop are right now dropping supers on everything I don't really think you have much of a moral high ground yes your both shit for the game congrats.
---
They used to have unique loot, but that was changed years ago.
---
There aren't any sotiyos on that list, the T2 rigs of which are the main hyper expensive rigs in the game. 
---
It might total to like 100 Bil. maybe. Not sure about the 2 Keepstars' rigs.

Working on your creative writing final i see :)
---
Can I apply even if I do not drink alcohol? :D
---
Tuskers are fucking ballers!
---
I literally watched one of the first fights where NC. brought a fuckton of muninns versus Unspoken with rattles plus a fax, andd Unspoken did real well.
---
This was a long time ago tho
---
I’ve been asking for these changes for years, but I support them for the reasons you list as well.
---
Look into exploration and explorer hunting. Hunting is mostly afk but isk/varies wildly and it honestly is usually not that great. Exploring is easily 100 mil/hr, and I think I usually get 150 on a good day, you just have to find fairly empty areas in Sansha’s space and explore during not peak times
---
I'm not claiming to have the moral high ground. I don't know where you got that out of what I wrote.
---
 Just pointing out the logic flaw.
---
Same for TEST, above a certain sp threshold / age of player (in terms of years played) threshold.
---
At least adjacent to an NPC region.
---
I don't get it
---
What software do you use to capture and edit footage?
---
We didn't really until last summer. We actually fought goons (who were helping the russians) to take Catch / Eso, when we were homeless.
---
Or at least some kind of artificial rarity needs to be added. The original economic rarity clearly hasn’t been working for a while.
---
Maybe a system where there is a fixed number of Supers and Titans and all of them are owned by NPC factions. Players then rent them for a month at a time through an auction system.
---
If forcing you to retreat, tail between legs is bungling...well...idk what to tell you. 2nd year in a row you've had to do that now apparently.
---
Was expecting a condom...   am disappointed.
---
Wow you are a bitter person and im sad for you.
---
Invasions aren't an "event", like seasonals - they're intended to be far more persistent of a feature, and that'd make sense in line with them being the only way to get certain assets.
---
Great Wildlands could badly use some other stations as well.
---
how does winning feel now?
---
wow really shocked to see &lt;B0T&gt; on this list! i always thought they were the good guys /s
---
Dude I love this work, but as a pessimist; I feel like you just told everyone were to go to bot knowing that CCP wont use logic to solve this problem.
---
How much botting happens in unknown space when compared to the number of people visiting/living in it?
---
Or even just have pilots show up as unknown pilot with no standing for the 10 seconds while local processes their identification.
---
git gud scrub
---
He's german
---
nothing more dangerous than a cyno being lit next to you.  You could easily make it so you can only cyno from a connected wormhole.  Add in some additional fatigue in wormholes to make it harder to move things in and out.
---
Because by removing the structures you remove and conflict drivers the reality is nc/pl isn't gonna be able to fight anything as long as the GSF supers are in jump range, so really the best solution is not to fight wait 6/8 months until they're bored and take there space back ( or pull a CVA effectively ).
---
Remember, you already know what it should say, which decreases your time to read it.
---
I do cinematics and they take a *looong* time. A 3-5 minute video usually needs a couple of hours of source footage and then 10-15 hours of editing out the garbage. It's fun but it's also super time consuming.
---
i know but i wont tell you
---
Recording - OBS
---
Editing - Shotcut
---
Yep - each of the tech II triglavian ships are produced by one of the empires, and as such use different naming schemes from the old slavic of the Trigs themselves. Nergal, Draugur, Ikitursa, and Zarmazd each draw from a different hystorical/mythological area that isn't far-separated from that of the empire that makes it.
---

---
Wow such smart and innovative whaling.
---
I like how this is your top whaling story to tell in any context.
---
They were either a:) a strong independent alliance that didnt need help or b:) our lackeys and needed help defending.  Which were they, you act like Co2 was the only alliance under attack at that time.  It was not, a month before M-O we were busy defending our own space too.  I never saw co2 show up to any of our timers in any significant number.
---
ye true lmao
---
0 run freighter BPC'S.
---
Thanks I'm trying to but theres so much info it's a little overwhelming.
---
Praise Be Upon Him, it's a goon thing.
---
I am sure a lawyer could find a way to track customers reliably. But it's a shame, would have been an elegant solution.
---
Really? A dowvote? Gimme ur stuff too you grouchy old fart.
---
Ever seen the finish line of a marathon?
---
must be bait if not, please go and kill yourself, ingame
---
What would the lore reason be for drones to drop stations that capsuleers can use?
---
What is the difference between using log off and log off safely?
---
Given test's history with Snuff I see them as willing now that brings in Init on the snuff side, they could likely come to an agreement with FRT given Panfam is looking for a new home in the near future I'm sure the willing to play ball if the deal is good enough at this point test is standing alone and honestly in massive trouble.
---
I believe they had a fleet out at the same time from what I saw looking around afterwards, so I imagine a lot of their PvP pilots weren't there - Just an unfortunate matter of timing, and hopefully we'll catch them at a better time next time!
---
There was also a demo over 10 years ago of a ship entering a planet's atmosphere.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pg1dzAvL2M CCP likes to do demos and never follow up.
---
Actually I quite like that idea, It would solve the issue of the botters putting an alpha on grid with the gate to watch for gate flash, unless they program the bots to always dock up until proven blue.
---
&gt;git gud scrub
---
Well yes there should always be a hunt for botters. 
---
Yes I live in the Dronelands, as now part of BoT (was previously Phoenix Company/Badfellas)...i despises botters. I hate it when someone posts a cheap ratting fit...shocker VNI... i tell we dont afk rat or mine, so get to the fuck with that bot looking fit..this isnt the corp for you. 
---
Yes I live in Malpais currently (also Cobalt Edge, Perrigan Falls)...and what are you talking about...safe haven NPC stations for hunters. I've fighting out here for years. They arent safe havens to any real degree. (Ask Bei Artjay been fighting his lot for years, or any of the decent blop hunters)
---
We always get roaming gangs, wh ers, whaling fleets, Constant cloaky campers.
---
 So NO, there isnt a reason to insert npc space. Any one can throw down an astrahouse to base out of...and they do its a big area, blops can heavily cover it and they do. 
---
Yes fight BOTs everywhere...but dont make null easier. BOTTERS can also use those to store fits, clones etc. Disrupt BOTTING programs and multi boxing. Surely CCP can detect that.
---
Also conspiracy theory...interesting you name fixing Malpais in Drones. they"re fighting back. (Well with help from friends at last). What CE or Skillu space.
---
Yeah lol xd so edgy maaaan
---
You know nothing sharo snow
---
did you make a whole new account or another character on the same account? if you did make a new account go to the neocom menu, inventory, redeem items.
---
That is horrible given the cost of Milk, Water and Exotic Male Dancers.
---
Peace, actually. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_be_upon_him
---
Great job, thanks!
---
RNG is only an issue for singular events, if you do one or a few sites. If you do a large number of sites then the randomness becomes a constant. I make 400-800 mil a day with it, on average, in high sec. Some days I get around that number, some days I make way more, some days way less. 
---
But on average, the income is quite good.
---
We always complain about the huge titan blobs. CO2 held their territory in fade for as long as they did, because they fended off multiple attempts with help of their (old) cyno jammers, for example.
---
Now, the new jammers are just pure cancer. But i kinda don't want them removed entirely.      
---
If i had to pick between the current jammers and no jammers as easy to implement options, i'd also take no jammers, though.
---
it's more the ironic thing where the very people being on the receiving end are now doing the same while making the game well even more shit for everyone and parading around like it's some sort of victory.
---
Yup. As another example, Old School RS also has a large botting/rmt problem, and a large majority of the players doing so are from Venezuela, where 1 of the OSRS currency is worth more than a Venezuelan Bolivar. Playing to RMT there is a viable career due to economic realities, and as long as places like Russia and China remain poor players from those regions will be incentive to RMT/bot. Imagine if the average EU/US player could earn a living by running a few VNI bots. You can be pretty sure that there would be a lot more EU/US botters.
---
Have you checked the redeem items window in game?  It's been a minute since I've gone through it, but I feel like I remember having to redeem it on a character.
---
You're paying 3 subs for the omega benefits. You're not paying 3 subs for the event. Yes there are omega rewards for it. There are also alpha rewards. They're event bonuses to promote consistent logins.
---
Crap, my supers are in those keeps. Does asset safety still shove to low sec after long enough? I don't want to reactivate accounts just to evac.
---
log off safely has a 30 second timer before you are actually logged out
---
Yup, that's my main. Congrats. Something about growing up and a job and real life life and regular sex really gets in the way of playing video games, but please continue with the logical gymnastics of extrapolating one player's activity to encompass an entire alliance.
---
Or I could just tell you not to be talking shit about a player's activity who has 2.5 times more kills than you.
---
I'd be surprised if there were more T2 rigged sotiyos than could be counted on two hands.
---
I'd also be surprised if of those, any were T2 research rigged, because fuckin' lol, 600b last time I looked.
---
Shit, I'm pretty below average with only 12 omega alts.
---
fuck off globby
---
I'm shamelessly stealing:
---
"Docking up your citadels is some next level shit."
---
They were the "We will drop supers on you, even if you are a small group with less numbers because we elite!"
---
The only retard in this thread is the guy who can't see that his group was doing this before goons made it cool.
---
TIL Mittani is pronounced Mittanee.
---
You're all words but in-game you cannot shoot me because you're blue. One more word and I report you to your diplo.
---
yeah i feel ya, the most time-munching thing for me is time ramps (i dont like cuts) and fiddle audio snippets to the right moments
---
🏳️🏳️🏳️🏳️🏳️🏳️🏳️
---
Yay we can have Titans online or 100v10ing miners!
---
I don't think adding space is a feasible option here.       
---
Breaking off coalitions sounds fine, but it not only is seemingly impossible, but also against the core sandbox setting of eve.     
---
What CCP should strive for is give players other places to go have fun. Like lowsec for example. I have not better ideas for lowsec than to somehow bring a content driver like passive moon income back tbh. but that'd be something.      
---
I think we might see quite some people make their way back into low that way, away from huge null blobs. 
---
But we are getting quite off topic here.
---
Most of them would still have dedicated holders, but they would still need to sell or asset safety some supers to live without a keep.
---
No, it's not really ironic either.
---
It is as simple as pointing out the logic flaw inherent in the statement "People joined PL to dickwave supers,but that wasn't PL dickwaving supers".
---
Stop trying to make everything about whatever it is you're trying to make this about.
