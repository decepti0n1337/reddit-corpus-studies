Is this game worth getting into in 2019? Thank you!

---
I'm not a wormholer and I want asset safety removed from K-space structures.
---
This Killmail is triggering my PTSD
---
Drakes are good, especially passive, both plain old T1 and Navy variants.
---
So, what would you call it when NC stopped farming Horde?
---
Minmatar is pretty much hard mode, you learn kiting, brawling, shield, armor, speed tanking, drones, Missiles, projectiles, cap management, cap warfare(utility highs for days) how sheer dps in kinetic and thermal is different from hitting weakest resist with decent dps.
---

---
If you join min fw, you will learn how hard it is to unite people, how diplomacy is nessecary, how civil wars don't work out well, and why citadels in fw limits your pvp  sometimes from roaming to defense fleets against huge entities you can't win against, and how hardcore role play of fw minmatar has nothing to do with pvp
---
RNJESUS has smiled upon you
---
Yes, they are called jackpots. The chances of it happening is random. My old corporation in Fraternity had three in a row on weekly pops. Another corp I was in only had it happen once in three months on weekly pops.
---
A rorq lives for ages once the writing's on the wall, I'm sure the crew has time to get to the escape pods.
---
This is great! I love seeing these! Keep up the good work! 
---
Looks like after this it's most assuredly TDSIN and POSPY are going to be the uncontested 1 and 2 of J space 
---
Cause the current main meta requires multiple accounts, which translates to either you having no job and doing nothing but playing to plex for subs, or paying whatever accounts x subs per month. In addition, it has become a fucking bot breeding ground while at the same time is so assenine in and of itself that people are quitting over it in droves. Unsubbing, playing a lot less, many not even logging on anymore.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
that said, for a brand new player, it takes a long time to get to the point of that meta or a ton of $$$$$$, either way, if you choose the time route, the journey itself is somewhat OK ish, minues the exterminated small / mid roams and fights which are now becoming a thing of the past, again, due to the above mentioned meta.
---
Don't forget about FW either. With all the changes they have done, there is no point for any FW group to win or loose space for their faction when you can just drop a citadel or 5 in any low sec system.
---
It's ever riskier if it's a neutral one.
---
The owner takes away your docking rights while you're docked, now once you undock you're functionally stuck in empty space and a free kill.
---
Blue cit &gt; station &gt; freeport.
---
As a small time rorqual pilot, I could accept this kind of trade off. And I hope you meant an 80% reduction in fuel costs. Otherwise, the price of ore would skyrocket, as everybody would be mining ice for the sudden 80% boost in heavy water profits.
---
I don't see the merit in this argument. People have been memeing about how the game has been dying since it's inception and it still hasn't died.
---
The people who are playing may not be the same people who started 5 years ago, but the game is still doing well. People are just overblowing the doom and gloom shitposting that's echoed on r/eve too much.
---
Somewhere in the escape menu. Possibly the General tab in the top right area.
---
jOin SiGs aNd sQaDs
---
Yeah...we are sooo bad mmm'kay.  
---
Actually, nevermind. Just go to zKill and depress yourself by looking at our killboard.
---

---
What is dead can never die
---
Some new stuff came in, Abyss is good, rest of the PvE is kinda meh. They just can't get risk vs reward right. Citadels are both good and bad, need further work and improvement. They can definetly be very good for the game once done.
---
Main meta in the game sucks major ass from just about every perspective. its so bad and boring people eitehr AFK it or bot it and play other games while their accounts are running and just hang out on comms. No joke. Seriously. In addition it has caused a lot of economical damage to the game that looks irrecovable and its a fucking breeding ground for bots.
---
He mostly plays Eve via discord, or whatever app goons use for pings, iirc. His last kill was whoring on the CO2 keepstar a few months ago

I feel like they are drilling into a whole that they think "works"  When they should be stirring things up and changing the consequences and adding new ones.  It makes me sad. 
---
I wish Goons evicted us. Make the pain of nullsec sov go away.
---
O7 The cyno is now lit
---
Don't be so eager. Take it easy. Get hang of the actual game mechanics first. When you look for a corp, if you want to kick back and chill, join a HS corp that doesn't have any structures. This is very important or it may cause you to leave the game. If you don't like the corp you end up with, or simply decide to do other things such as PvP, then do not be afraid to leave them, be nice about it, don't be an ass to them, leave on good terms, but do leave and move onto another one that will fit what you want to do better.
---
I was typing a response to help you figure out what was causing it before it clicked and I realised I wooshed myself 
---
Drake (nope nope nope nope)
---
Leshak (YEPYEPYEPYEPYEPYEPYEPYEP)
---
I pee'd a little.
---
You can take a T4, T5 Abyss fit Gila and run L4s with it very easily, or DED sites.
---
I dont remember a single time when I felt our relation with NC was “us being  farmed”.
---
They were neutral, I used to kill their ratters and their renters as well, it was normal null pvp.
---
The only thing we had with NC was the “dont shoot at structures” rule, which as far as I know it was honored.
---
NC once complained we were cloaky camping their renters in Tribute, so we stopped doing it (and they stopped doing it to us). I dont remember any other problem with NC aside of that one (aside the whole Darkness thing, but thats FAR more recent).
---
If you have any other input aside of a single km showing some really bored supers, share it.
---
Don’t know, is EVE network I/O bound? Latency is the issue? 
---
kinda sad tbh because brave back in Barleguet was amazingly fun, now sure part of that might be my rose-tinted glasses but everything went downhill once brave went into null. 
---
Seems like a disconnect from corp thing tbh ( never seen coms or well chatting as a huge barrier ), now Aufay seems near a block of 0.5 so it might be a mission hub, because of the block of 0.5's 
---
But honestly, I can't really remember the 2013 highsec layout and active systems. 
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
You spelled Komodo wrong.
---
NC didn't even hold tribute when this happened.
---
zkillboard around the time of the killmail have multiple supers dropped into 7RM and even more fleets killing everything.
---
&gt;best titan
---
Yeah I guess if you like tidi blobfests 
---
? 
---
You are most welcome sir.
---
I got my first venture two days ago and I've been enjoying my high-sec mining, no idea where I'm going from here though.
---
Hawks and NOVAC? Also this is one Hole Control corp of several. They're one of the few actual wormhole alliances
---
7RM was PVP Central back then, the most dangerous system in EVE by far.  You’ll have to be more specific then,,  some “fleets killing everything” may be something big for you, but that was something that happened every single day in 7RM back then.
---
Virtuoso, based on the Nemesis, that still says Nemesis on the wing.
---
Just another example of lazy reskinning. But we're supposed to be excited when the art dept comes out with something new and fancy looking. And we're supposed to immediately drop $20 to have one. Cus CCP heard about how bad microtransactions are for games, and decided the solution was not to do anything micro.
---
TNT is still a thing?
---
Are the Goons finally going to get rid of the big bad T-REX?
---
What launchers would you fit on a drake? RLM? HAM?
---
&gt;Initiative plans on being deployed for months in the North. 
---
HAHAHAHA, They only had 16 people in their north staging today and were station camped by 6 horde cormorants.
---
&gt;!Thread failed. Better delete all my comments! !&lt;
---
Yup. More bots and AFK multiboxed shit with less people sitting and actually playing. Gotta do something to keep that Concurrent User number up ....
---
Depends on the site and rats. I'd go either Heavy Missiles for long range or Heavy Assault for DPS. Definetly not lights though.
---
Love it!
---
Well we still play .... we just don't sub or plex anymore. Just kinda log in see if tehre is anything actually worth plexing or subbing, say "hi" fuck around a bit, log off.
---
Sounds to me like he just likes to gloat.
---
I'm not trying to be an ass, but my time has become exponentially more valuable since starting my current job and the birth of my daughter. Sacrificing time and the game changes that enable me to pick up and go in a short time frame have been a godsend for my eve experience, personally.
---
A few years ago, I simply woke up on my day off and wound up in the first wave of capitals for B-R; yesterday, I got one of my corpmates to ask my other half in advance before a roam. There's a lot to be said about the overall health of the game, but not really needing to worry about the safety of everything my corp has built has been fantastic for me; and spending a couple hours on a Sunday to solo roam in a cyclone - only to get wiped with no kills - is massively frustrating.
---
Eve has evolved to become a much easier game to play casually, for better or worse.
---
You missed my entire post, learn to read champ. 
---
CCP is R&amp;D, which means Research and Development not game development. They research new tech for other companies, and get good contracts for it. 
---
They also happen to have this EVE Online thing that makes some money too.
---
Okay let's compare a BR server to an MMO server those are totally similar, hint they aren't. 
---
don't worry the servers were proven not to be capable of handing large super engagements anyway so at most those will be used for ratting anyway...
---
sure, i mean solo is fine but after you learn how the mixed / group mechanics work... as to get a legit 1:1 solo is often difficult so understanding how your opponents communicate during fights etc is important.
---
That difference has nothing to do with which particular cloud platform they are on though. The point is that Azure is fine.
---
lol what war? everything's blue as far as the ye can see...
---
Eve is dying = other players have adapted to their play style.
---
Sib Squads have the biggest pair of balls of any alliance I've flown with or against.
---
None of this "ohmygeezus we can't use a carrier without complete subcap grid control it might die" nonsense, with the Russians it's all done in the Russian way - balls deep, titans out.
---
https://www.aetherengine.io/aetherwars
---
right about now you must be feeling pretty bad... like... ooft....
---
Seriously, this whole lets drop carriers to kill prize frigs is very dishonorable.
---
Shame on you Pan-Intergalatic Business Community.
---
Shame on you.
---
And using it exclusively to gank newbies in exploring frigs is honorable? 
---
You should be happy he has the balls to undock with it, most don't.
---
Most people don't have the balls to drop carriers in enemy space either.
---
Its an edition not new ship like vechicals. Gmc sierra vs gmc sierra denali one worth alot more with more gadgets and shit
---
I don't think so, i think things are more fun now. Being able to freefire on anyone who comes in that isn't blue and having better control over the space overall has made the game more enjoyable for me. 
---
It makes me sad now thinking about how much i missed out on because i was being dumb and bullheaded about talking to people and didn't find my way back sooner.
---
This is art.
---
I like my Jackdaw thank you very much...
---
No those would be customs offices, which do planetary interaction... you’re looking for citadels, specifically athanors and tataras mostly. They’ll be on your default overview.
---
Translation: We're thinking of using this as our new MMO engine.. before we buy it, jump onto this new client/server to test it out for us... if it holds we'll cut them a cheque ..if it doesn't... well.... that paragraph where i said we're committed to doing shit...may need to break that promise or two.
---
Oh, we didn't also notify any community leaders of this shit going down, so hopefully they will just react to the sound of my voice and we get 10,000 coalition, alliance and corporation leaders to rally their line members to the cause...
---
Love you... CCP Hilly..
---
This post plus :18 months:. I'm getting *such* an Incarna vibe. At least this one is about spaceships, I guess.
---
SO HIGH! like holy shit the prices are through the roof. Just look at the cost of moon goo! https://ore.cerlestes.de/market 
---
they've all been going down SO much! how will i ever afford t2 ships now? huneybeez r the wurst.
---
THIS. I usually scrap a site once I'm finished and when I'm warping in with my little Algos I still get it after I've already cleared the site, very annoying
---
Koreans can already play eve, they are localizing the client so that they dont have to read english.
---
REEEEEEE
---
Many would be willing to trade insured ships for a kill on a limited edition ship 
---
Lower demand. 
---
CCP pushed everyone to Rorq multiboxing and super/titan ratting hard last 2 years. It was nice short term profit before the sale to PA. Now, everyone who wants Rorquals has as many as they want. Everyone who wants a titan have it too. And they have nothing to do with these stuff. And they don't get destroyed fast enough. So price goes down. And it's only downhill from now until a new equilibrium is hit between excavator losses and production.
---
The worrying this is what's gonna happen now once people reached the end of PvE and have all the assets they want. No major wars, not much destroyers in ultra safe space, and when asset acquisition stops being a reason to log on Eve itself will go downhill. I expect CCP will try to prevent that with a new balance (or hope so). Let's see what happens.
---
Can confirm - Have watched Hanzo scream Cyka Blyat and take the bait, and its awesome :D
---
They dont have the initiative
---
peace in the dronelands have caused the parts for excavators to drop.  in particular Elite Drone AI's have plummeted.  Supply also bascially outstrips demand right now.  
---
T2 prices haven't changed much at all.  If anything they have dropped a bit, but they fluctuate given that it is a smaller market than minerals and can have short term supply issues.  T2 cores have basically stayed in the same range. 
---
Are officers really that strong that you need a carrier to kill them?
---
Think I hit a nerve tbh, I was just shitposting when I seen AT and  NT in the same paragraph but with the froth on your mouth I probably wasnt far off.  
---
With the AT in 1 hand and EVE\_NT in another... it makes no sense at all not to run the AT.  So why not run it and why wouldn't NT run it for you?  Tbh it even makes no sense not to throw money at them until they say ok especially if its just for 1 year... though with CCPs record and the recent NT and Russian tournaments arranged completely by the players, maybe CCP was hoping to simply step back and get it done for free or with payment of plex/skins?  Maybe CCP were hoping a player run org would/will see a gap in the market, even forgetting the huge prize money and running it more often, saving CCP internal resources in regards to hosting and developing AT ships while getting free advertising.  A treasure trove of potential opportunity by simply doing nothing... it's one of those difficult but brilliant ideas *if it works,* and if it doesn't then fuck it we'll do it next year same bat time same bat channel, we'll get teams and most of the people who watch don't currently play anyway.  
---
Idk, I'm just trying to come up with a real reason for the cancellation as that informative cancellation post was not it, hiatus indeed... a hiatus makes no sense, not as a cover for a rockstar in rehab and certainly not for an AT cancellation.  CCP is consistently and collectively FOS, so ofc we assume the worst, sadly we end up closer to reality than we do hoping for the best.  
---
I see your post was upvoted by 19 people with brains, eagerly awaiting another empty promise, or maybe the next expansion, with an open mouth and wide eyes, I almost feel sorry for them.  
---
If Blizzard (which is a billion dollar company) has a hard time at combating bots in WoW, what makes you think CCP with their "infinite resources" , high caliber IT project management skills and absolute problem solving skills can? Well then can't, botting and RMT is time and memorial in any MMO and the only way to kill botting would be to kill that MMO so good luck with that...
---
So your understanding of balance is that you avoid the problem and pretend it doesnt exist. Why are you taking part in a discussion when you have no intention of fixing the problem?
---
Yea so happy for a elite pvp player to undock his multi billion ship to wreck those pesky explorers, what a great service to us all delivering this km

Will crime watch be apart of this test? :)
---
you can sometimes gimmick them with subcaps, but they hit hard and far (some sit at 100km going 2k/s). Carrier just makes it so so so much easier.
---
10 + years and I've never seen an officer rat. But I've also never bothered trying to find one.
---
For over a decade. 
---
if they did that, I'd be so there ! 
---
winning in eve is determined by the guy who owns the space while the former own cries about how fair the war was from lowsec.
---
I think EVE is single-thread compute bound for a single system. If I read this right, they will be able to rebuild the EVE system simulation server to be massively threaded to the point that threads can be on different servers connected by a (presumably) very fast network. 10Gb/s is enough, 40Gb/s is best IMO to reduce latency between boxes. However, if they do this well, it will enable a system node to at least scale to the full size of a physical server which can be 80+ times more compute than what a single core can offer. It'll be buggy as fuck for a while, but this is impressively ambitious.
---
These are all just the same low effort shit pictures, anything original?
---
No, by that I mean small fleet pvp. Why would you just feel the need to interject some random shit? Are you stupid or something? Did you even read anything I said? At this point you're just trying to save face and making shit up to protect your ego. By all means spin whatever I say if it makes you feel better. I do pity you... as sad as that is. I'm not a monster. I care one day you'll be better than this and able to embrace change. Cheers mate. I'll be awaiting yet another response from you to make more shit up. 
---
I duno. CCP said the same thing about a lotta code that went wrong very badly haha. 
---
Naw that’d be to easy
---
Small 5 man fleets used to hunt in Lowsec not in the mega empires of nullsec.  Then again, the mega empires were not so mega compared to now.
---
I feel like things would be substantially improved if everyone who worked at ccp had to spend 2h a day playing eve
---
I’d be the first to come back to the game and join TEST just to do my part in burning delve 
---
They'll fit right in with people on this sub then!

Ask yourself - what are YOU doing to delete C4 space?  Anything in the chain you can ref/burn to the ground with a few alts!?  Have you seen any C4s with structures in them lately, did you seed a scout?  No need for hole control (pun intended), just tell people you're deleting C4 space and they will assist.  Once the heretics have been purged and their shit drops you can pillowfight with their t1 bullshit for hours.  Delete a C4 near you today!
---
Memes on top of memes here, but I swear I actually started typing rolesale instead of holesale on zkill... those nerds not affiliated with HC anymore? Are they doing anything to burn RUS assets down or roll in?

I'm sorry I've never played wow.  I just dropped like 20$ on this game and applied to eve university, we'll see how I like it. I made some characters back in 2008 and flew around in wormholes i think and got bored waiting for skill ups.

---
Yeah but let's not haze them for trying -- I'd much rather have them keep trying (and failing) to solve tidi and get 10,000 player fights than to keep trying (and failing) to make mobile games. 
---
r/eve is just filled with a bunch of vets with rose colored glasses.  Lots of things used to suck.  Lots of things still suck.  They could definitely make some changes to liven up the universe, but it isn't nearly as bad as people make it out to be.  
---
yes, and the most recent iteration lasted over a year, which was the most problematic and consistent one by far
---
I dont think 2 drone navs is a big stretch for a domi...  especially when I was comparing it against an even more absurd carrier fit (that would struggle to break 1m ehp).
---
This is not really true.  CCP pre-nerfs many ships before launching them.
---
This may be the greatest and best thing I have ever seen.
---
You seem to spend an inordinate amount of your time responding to someone who is supposedly irrelevant.
---
If they are going to be deployed months I hope do something..
---
Ouch my spelling, fuck your long ass words.
---
You probably looked over your post 4 times to make sure your little shit post didn't have any errors in it.

Que 2019, and now I am being called bad because people are not doing this...
---
You never go full retard. But you did, and continue to do so....reeeeeeee
---

---
Exactly! Why should CCP stop at 64 bits? We can go a full 256!
---
report this glitch to ccp they will rename to proper 
---
Agreed.  I started playing a few years ago, and been having a good time ever since. 
---
Shiiiiit. I hope that they haven't destroyed any things that my stuff is in or something. Haven't logged in in years but I still care for my freighter.

---
That...hasn't exactly worked out for them, since nearly every project they've done thus far results in them losing a ton of money and having to cut a bunch of staff.  After the last failure, they didn't have much left to cut and had to go for a buyout instead.  
---
We'll see what the future holds, but there's really been no indications that anything meaningful has changed.

---
It's a meme some dude in the HK disbanding thread posted
---
"the should just beehive themselves"
---
Nothing like a Combat Endurance. 
---
Let's do some more telling math: so 2008 people where in a rorqual killmail ( of the 47 that died this month in all of eve ), this means it takes on average 42 people to kill a rorqual, this number gets worse when we only include rorqs with panic fitted, as the low number kills constantly lack panic, if somebody wants to do the math feel free.
---
Now here is the kicker, in that same time frame in the month of March the total number of citadel losses is 112 when you ship is saver than a structure with 3 re-enforce timers people might have a bit of a point that your ship might be kinda OP. 
---
Then we could move to Perimeter full time and not have to worry about JCs!

---
LMAO! Thankfully I live in a detached house. 
---
There is what 500 C4s? If anyone can name 5 decent C4 corps and I'll delete my post.
---
you can try null-sec gas mining later. Risky but it comes with a reward thousand times better. The problem is that the skills for gas mining are a bit expensive and it will take some time to make you character learn everything.
---
Nullsex is already at that point where everyone has what they want. Except Stain Guy at least he's the only guy in game that has an actual "End Game" in EVE with a Lowsex gate to Stain...
---
I can only dream of having this problem.
---
Clearly a C4 dweller, not very original and a srsfgt.

You can cancel it in warp too, you won't jump

None yet - it's the only mainline game in the series I haven't finished. I have the HD remake on my Wii U, I just haven't gotten around to playing it yet.
---
yes what other games have ever been in a state of dying and the main playerbase is koreans and russians
---
wait literally every game
---
It's a trap!
---
You didn't define "decent", but here goes anyway: POSPY, NJED, BLTH (sadly in the process of being evicted), ERB, Spoopy Newbies, CeskoSlovenska. I've gotten fun fights of different types out of all of them.
---
I like the siphon hauler. Sansha/Blood Raider blockade runner when?
---
Just getting back into industry (t2 manufacturing / invention) Seems like many of the old tools that calculated profitability etc are out of date with the new api. What do people use these days to track what you are building and import prices from different trade hubs?
---
The client stays the same, only 64 bit instead of 32 bit. Less crashes in big fights, more memory available for stuff such as further UI work, maybe some better more accurate physics etc.
---
The new OS is essentially server only.
---
You're about 12 hours late, and Eve is already available in Korea, the client is adding localisation
---
Handy capping
---
I thought people only flew gallente for the hull tanks. 
---
Oooof
---
Haha fair enough, I was just joking there are quite a few dudes in C4 space that have kicked my ass.

Yeah, I get the rush to get into bigger ships but the core skills, especially the fitting ones are crucial. A skilled pilot in a frigate will have the fitting and skills to get the most out of the ship and can fight to its fullest potential. Where as a green pilot in a battleship will not be able to fit the most optimum fit, have the full hit points and most importantly have the capacitor skills to run everything. Lots of green pilots die in big costly battleships and battle cruisers because of this. 
---
Focus on those core skills, the energy skills the capacitor skills.  Get the t2 modules, get the frig skill up to level 4 and then move on to destroyers and so on. 
---
This way you'll find it takes almost no effort to pilot a destroyer and then the cruisers and so on. 
---
Well, if you're giving the game a third try then I'll give you a few no-bullshit tips to help you enjoy it more:
---
* Joining Eve Uni was a good idea, they'll help you learn a lot about the game. Not sure how they are on the community aspect, but nothing stops you from finding another corp/alliance if you're not liking it.
---
* Try out the Sisters of Eve "[Bloodstained Stars](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Blood-Stained_Stars)" mission this week. It's a pretty good crash course.
---
* Don't try to rush the skill train for battleships and capitals, a lot of the high skill/high adrenaline fighting is with cruisers down. Bigger does not equal better in Eve.
---
* Two classic Eve sayings are "treat your ships like ammo" and "anytime you undock you consent to pvp". You're going to die, a lot. You're always going to die a lot. Just accept it and go balls deep.
---
* Get the fuck out of high security space (hisec) as fast as you can. A lot of new people think they need to spend time in hisec to learn how to play before they go to lowsec/nullsec/wormholes. That's a mistake, hisec has totally different rules and different ways to play the game, you'll never learn how to survive anywhere else in Eve by living in hisec.
---
Sort has a credit card and a mouth, they'll be fine...
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Just curious how people choose their factions and for what reasons? Just so I can get some ideas, that would be nice.  
---
&gt;If you guys could just tell me what factions you have been focusing on and for what type of activities.  
---
&gt;Me personally I have trained up to battlecruisers on all factions and battleships on minmatar. But sadly at this point I still can’t decide what I enjoy flying and which faction to focus on completely..  
---
&gt;But Gallente and Caldari are by far my favorite looking ships.
---
Years ago I started as Gallente. It was an underdog, literally everything about it was fucked. Drones, hybrids, a lot of stuff. As I progressed in game I got to the point where I could fly almost all ships except some supers and some titans. Since then I have actually scaled down, sucked out a lot of the cap, super and Ore indy skills and pumped them all into my combat characters to round them out when skill injectors came out. kept only 1 line of caps and that only up to dred, some minimal mining for occasional WH shenanigans or a mission or something here and there. Kept all research skills on one character cause research is nice to have for self use and to make an occasional drop more valuable for sale. Kept one alt hauling and trade skills.
---
I went back to flying Gallente, but then CCP fucking gutted Proteus. So now am flying Loki / Tengu for T3C, Gila for PvE, some battleships here and there mostly for PvE. The ships I have most fun with are Vedmak and Drekavac. Trig ships, they're a blast. I would really love to come back to Gallente, but the turret boats need some love, Proteus needs to be vastly buffed.
---
So my favorite is Gallente but I can't fly it due to it sucking at stuff I do :( Trig ships are fun, but now I went back down to alpha and can't do those either, or T3Cs. It is up to CCP and their actions / inactions on wether I will resub and come back to the game full time or not.
---
O dude, you are missing out. Big time. If you intend to stay in the game for a longer period of time, these are most fun ships in the game, both PvE and PvP alike.
---
We went back to our home staging for the past few days to defend some home sov. Don’t worry, we will be back
---
Have you also been playing for 10 years?
---
Pretty ballsy of him to fly that regardless
---
Again it just depends on your Corp what they use in their doctrines. You can assume that you’ll need something to scan in, something to rat in, and several things to pvp in. Beyond that the details depend on your skills and your Corp and your wormhole. For me I usually scan in an astero, rat in a Nestor, and fly logi so several of the T2 logi cruisers or frigates we use in our doctrines. 
---
I started in wormholes though I’m just a Dominix to rat and an imicus to scan.
---
Your skills determine what you can fly not where you can fly. If your interested in wormholes then just use whatever ship you can
---
&gt;So yes, I somewhat agree that the defenders need to be smart, but even then, the rorqual has so many advantages under a super umbrella that it's a bit ridiculous.
---
My opinion is that if someone(or a group, collectively) is doing everything right and putting in more effort being safe than you are to ganking them, they shouldn't be in any danger.
---
So if a thousand man alliance runs a tight ship with eyes, spies, and capital/subcap superiority, you just shouldn't be able to do anything to them, outright.
---
quality content
---
Everyone tried to catch you my brav..everyone except me!

I love you op.
---
Does "omni damage" for rats (i.e. sleepers) mean that damage will be evenly spread across all types, or that it will be concentrated on your biggest resist hole?
---
I use them to huff gas, 7 ventures huff mighty quick.
---
Ess solutions; can only be anchored at the sun, can be shot and destroyed by rats...
---
Just make roids attackable and destroyable via simple weapon-fire. Latest when their precious Colossals are gone folks will try to go after you with forks and torches to save the Enormous Clusters ;)
---
Ive been everywhere. But C4 is fun, dual statics, without having a kspace. Fuck kspace.  I dont know what your word vomit means, nor do I care. I've seen you spew a bunch of dumb shit, with no REAL claim or reason. It's just noise. 
---
aaand delete your comment. Nice. Own it dude! Don't self-destruct your opinions like defeated wormholers do to their caps. 
---
Remember when gevlon would pay them 100b a month and they had to promise to kill equal to that in goons...I member
---
So the alliance pays for that guys lost drones then? That’s a pretty sweet deal. 
---
wipe all accounts snd start eve like its 2003

&gt;This is a server OS that CCP could run their application on with ~~minimal~~ re-writing to make work.
---
Someone who doesn't post worse than Brisc Rubal.
---
they're adding local chat to Korea
---
Ok so you are saying a node is cpu bound on a single thread and the way up is making a node multithreaded or multiprocess. That sounds like major reengineering, of which this hadeanOS doesn’t seem to help much except in the sense they will provide better network performance between nodes and maybe threads.
---

Someone is mass-producing battle rorquals to use as drone-carrier dreads.

Where in the fuck have you been senpai???
---
Isnt it safer to just scan wormholes to find gas sites? In null sec i all ways got basted seconds after using gate
---
Approximately how much dps does it take to break the reps on a low level sleeper site (c1-3)?
---
Pog
---
The damage they deal is evenly spread—25% of each.  
---
So if a sleeper hits you with 400 damage it'll be 100 of each.  
---
If your resist profile is EM20 THR40 KIN60 EXP80, you'll take 80 points of EM damage, 60 points of thermal damage, 40 points of kinetic damage, and 20 points of explosive damage for a total of 200 hitpoints.

---
The eve is dying mostly comes from the fact that eve isnt the merciless landscape it used to be.  Asset safety, cap umbrellas, panic modules, and citadel mechanics have undermined the conflict drivers of the game.
---
Dont get me wrong, great mechanics have come with the changes, but they've come to us all half baked.  Module tiericide has been left on the back burner and the economic issues arent being addressed.  This is why those saying that eve is dead arent wholly wrong.  The game we know and love is actually dead.  Is eve still a game? Of course, but it isnt the one we fell in love with.
---
It's the same thing that happened to WoW.  Vanilla was a great creation.  It had its flaws, but it was relatively hardcore.  Each expansion made it more user friendly, but doing so eroded the game.  The same thing has happened with Eve.
---
I need one please, pm me if you are willing to sell one!
---
So all this technical jargon isn't my type of tech jargon... will we get maybe 5 Hertz? Even 2 would be nice....
---
Sorry dude, I had already forgot about FW, just like the devs
---
I'll have you know I've only gotten two noise complaints in 15 months at my new apartment
---
Shorter tricks still ends up being more calculations done overall.
---
Always take the bait FC. Always take bait.
---
Honestly korean players have concerns about that.
---
CCP must restrict korean players from playing account without their unique id 
---
if the game offers korean language and if it rated as only for adults (I’m p sure about it, there is lots of drugs and unlimited pvp on eve online)
---
From our experience this kind of issue usually forced us to use awkard client or use vpn, but idk, just hoping this issue solved well.

it was kind of nice undocking and having the rest of eve sitting there waiting to kill us. 100% pvp content right on the doorstep. being poor did suck though
---
Did Gevlon actually quit EVE ?
---
After some research : He's pulling the "i quit for real now" [cart](https://greedygoblinblog.wordpress.com/) again after switching games.
---
Ha ha ha, like we would wait through 6 months of boring ass peace, just to leave when fighting starts again. ;)
---
I just use Eve Isk Per Hour and Fuzzworks. 
---
I don’t track every job I do. That sounds awfully tedious at any kind of scale. I also only buy from Jita buy orders so I never have to do multiple trade hubs, not sure what you’d use to do that besides a custom made spreadsheet maybe.

I guess typhoon fleet issue will be his favorite ship;

He can fire cruise missiles with nuclear L ammo, due to it’s awkard dual weapon system bonus.

---
Have you considered Planetary Interaction?
---
Call the SEC
---
It is supposed to help by abstracting away the complexity of maintaining these channels so that the Eve devs can focus on the server and not have to implement their own stack which is huge. Especially if it lives up to potential. The potential is that jita can grow to use as much hardware compute as it needs. It may slow down overall when it spills over to more physical systems, but if they can do it gracefully, then they can allow 20k people to pew with little lag.
---
However, I would say that while their approach is ground breaking, the cloud world has already developed patterns to allow this kind of interaction real-time.
---
&gt; Lose a region? Asset safety.
---
We're doing tons of industry out in null now though, that  wasn't the case before. So there's more at stake I bet. Even though we only pay 15% or whatever it is, of the value, to get it to safety, that 15% still adds up to more than we had in null a few years back.

Very high probability that whatever ships you own were given as rewards for career agent missions. These ships are all but worthless. I good newbie corp should have moneymaking opportunities week 1 that will net you millioms of isk/hr and i would assume any ships you have are in the ~$500k range. Sell them cheap on contract and stuff a couple frigates and maybe a destroyer into a t1 cargo hauler with some expanded cargoholds fitted to the lows. If you use the compare tool to look at industrials you will notuce each race has 1 hauler with more room and is slower this one for moving inexpensive ships with expanded cargoholds, and 1 hauler with less capacity but is faster and more agile, fit that one with nanofiber structure and use it to hall smaller, higher value items faster. Both haulers should be fitted with shield mods in the mids, and if you are omega you can put an improved cloak II in the highs and learn the cloak+mwd trick to help you align and warp safer, however that trick will only work for the faster hauler.

Fucking brilliant
---
This meme is as  good as your coalition
---
Leshaks are bonkers.
---
Drekavacs are good in small / medium sized wh &gt; null roams.
---
As for Amarr, heavy armor is very strong for brawling in WH's and since bhaalgorn capacitor warfare is king, active shield tanks eat shit anywhere not Pulsar.
---
So Bhaalgorns, Damnations, Loki's, Legions and Guardians used to be the core of a medium sized heavy armor brawl comp. This is an incredibly versatile fleet with high damage, insane buffer tank and decent mobility when combined with booshers. 5 Bhaalgorns will pretty much suck a 50man fleet dry in 3-4 minutes so anything with an active resistance profile will get force fed dicks. Damnations have free reign to fuck around with their midslots so you might see jams, painters, scrams, webs or w/e on them aswell. Super annoying. This is then combined with whatever EWAR is available or needed... 2-3 falcons etc etc etc. As the fleet mass increases you'll see less guardians and more triage fax + 2x Phoenix/Naglfar.
---
Nowadays Damnations and Loki's are being replaced by a mass of Leshaks. A top tier heavy armor brawl comp is Mass Leshaks + 5 Nosghorns + Link Damnations + 1-2 Fax / 1-2 Dreads.
---
I've been expecting this one. 
---
That's the point. Picture has 3 lasers, wish we could have 3 too.
---
Well maybe but my point is that they could theoretically improve things by just making the server multithreaded before even getting hadean in the picture. I suppose it’s possible that the benefits of doing this weren’t worth the cost without a better network stack but in any case the major piece of work is reengineering a system that is 15 years old of single threaded code into a paralellizable one. So it’s not “just plug hadean and recompile”. It’s a lot harder than that.
---
Regarding scalability remains to be seen. They will still be subject to some form of Amdahl’s law.
---
Great, but none of these numbers actually equate to people who play. If there were a substantial amount of plays who spoke Spanish, it would be economically viable for localization. 
---
I probably can count on my hand the amount of Spanish fluent players I know and I don't know anyone who speaks Spanish but not English.
---
i was so pissed my leshak was the slowest of all the ships in the fleet. 
---
looks at armor rigging skill. \*0\* FML
---
If there is a way, it's probably not very efficient. I think most people either just fit a salvager on an extra high slot, have an alt account to swoop in after the site is done, or skip salvaging altogether.
---
If a guy decides to shoot Your MTU he will become suspect and risk getting aggressed. I'd still scoop the MTU after it finishes what it is doing and would not leave it overnight.
---
Tengu. maybe its not the "Meta" but god damn thats one of the true multipurpose ships.

Messing with a citadel to procure fights. Came in muninns with a dread ball on standby, Iron Armada and friends brought in faxes and carriers, eventually bringing in dreads, a titan and supers.

I forgot to tell the best part: So when we went in on that carrier our interdictors (bubble ships) sacraficed themselves to slow those titans down long enough to let us kill the carrier. It was the most badass- brave/hero thing I've seen in the game.
---
At that moment... when I heard that go down on comms I realized I was playing space ships for real. That's like some shit from a sci-fi plot line.
---
This is a lie.

---
This is how you meme, ladies and gents.
---
&gt;10Gb/s is enough, 40Gb/s is best IMO to reduce latency between boxes
---
Latency is a product of distance, a number of intermediary hops, and an ability of network stack on endpoints to handle load. Bandwidth, while impactful when it comes to congestion, does not directly translate into latency.
---
Most importantly, high performance systems usually don't hide connection and scaling mechanisms behind neat "works like Linux" abstractions. It might sound nice to have simple channels, but those channels are leaky: they provide something that underlying layer doesn't guarantee. They will fail, inevitably, introducing a new class of errors to deal with.
---
Then there's HadeanOS - something that Google doesn't know much about. Which likely means EvE will be one of the early tests, with all the early adoption problems.
---
I'll stay hopeful, but very skeptical for now.

hell yeah

Just a quick tip : Nodes with 6 neighbors are either safe or border the core.
---
I would also recommend to always kill the restoration nodes (the defence subsystem that restore coherence to other uncovered Defence Subsystems).
---
Props for undocking but why
---
I think I didn’t train them because I’d rarely see those ships, is the leshak(idk the spelling) as annoying as the one in the abyss, where it can go 100000km and still have the annoying laser stuck on you haha

Let them learn what's good through trial and error, you don't have to demystify the game

I admit I don't know enough about fitting or the hull to determine if this was a good idea...  It just doesn't feel smart to run polarized launchers on this ship but maybe I just don't understand?

It's probably an Astero, not a Stratios. It's holding 8 light drones.

MTUs are great. Idk if so much in highsec, but in null, you can make like 100-150M (not counting possible faction loot) isk per hour just salvaging after a few rating people (or just one guy ratting in carrier/super). Advantage being, that the ship and fitting cost only a fem M and MTUs are cheap too. So, you cn have your investment back after as soon as 10-15 minutes and after that, everything goes to profit.
---
Step 1: Take a Cormorant (or other Dest that can fit 5 salvagers).
---
Step 2: buy 5 MTUs
---
Step 3: Find people who rat and do not salvage after themself (you can for instance bookmark combat anomallies and if the anomally disappears from your scanner, it is finished and if you warp there somewhat safely and there are no other people on the grid, you can drop MTU, bookmark it and come back in a few minutes for loot and salvage).
---
4. Salvage the living hell out of everything.
---
5. Rinse and repeat.
---
Battle ventures are awesome... especially with the extra warp stabby thingy
---
Even though I’ve been playing for a while it is nice to see a can have 10 mil in it, keep going and you’ll eventually get one with 100 mil in it
---
Basically it doubles the goo inside the rock.   RNJesus either grays or doesn’t. 
---
Actually wanted to trigger you to get some decent write up ... but i guess failed. 
---
When i see this i just want to go home and play.
---
Really nice video and i love the music  you used.
---
Thanks for sharing your fit as well.

Yesterday he formed a fleet and after the first half hour had passed quietly, there were some who wondered verbally on com's when he'd start his usual try hard fleet comp perfection sperg.  
---
Come the realization, his mumble shortcut had been deleted.
---
Rule of 6, killing certain virus popins, and keep smashing that D-scan!
---
Good work.
---
hehe Well the carrier was frankly not the cool part. The cool part was when we flew right into the maw of certain death like brave samurai.
---
Nice spin
---
Exactly. :)
---
TNT rocks!
---
Say again wormholers how you are so free and small gang friendly in a wild space without rules.
---
But you seem to get evicted if you don't join a major block...
---
Glistening is the variety of ore that jackpots
---
GF
---
Yeah, please, somebody should do that. Iwant to see all those titans and supers doing something else than sitting around keepstars or taking my anomallies. :)
---
pretty sure it is shut down already
---
Reddit is hard
---
CCP doesn't act on problems until the yelling gets loud enough.
---
A polarized frig can run circles around larger hulls and deal far more damage since they don't have to think of resists.  Polarized bombers will be far more flaky than normal bombers, but a large polarized bombing fleet (while expensive) will delete battleships and capital ships very quickly.  Sad that it had to be killed this way, though.
---
Sooo, got any more of those Intact armor plates or enhanced ward consoles?
---
i'm a new player, me and my friend will join your corp if you'll have us. We're in with this pitch.
---
You can do better than 2 words. 
---
Ive literally just returned to eve yesterday after 6 years off. Is bombers bar still a thing?
---
AAR:
---
On Sunday BLTH our russian alliance brothers reported an attacking fleet of about 90 Inner Hell and other russians. Apparently the reason is some russian drama and our recent eviction of Duckling Union may have had something to with it.  Also the faction fort was in the process of unanchoring I don't know exactly why.
---
We organized a ragerolling staging in a C5-C4 and went on rolling for 3 evenings straight. Btw. rolling C4 is not fun. We never managed to roll in.
---
The night before the Hull Timer BLTH succesfully went for hole control und we managed to get in about 30 in Muninns. During the day we also managed to get in some more mostly in ceptors.
---
During the first timers we tried to see if we can get an entrance skirmishing with the muninns but the attackers batphoned a Goons Jackdaw Fleet and a LSH Naga Fleet which made that impossible. Sadly about 50 of our guys in Muninns couldn't join the fight at all.
---
During the fight there where 5 Fleets. On our side as defenders there was a Muninn Fleet and a mixed Heavy Armor Fleet with about 20 Caps. The Attackers had a big drekavak fleet and the Jackdaw and Naga Fleet. Totaling about 170 Attackers against roughly 130 Defenders.
---
Our heavy armor fleet always tried to warp on top of the drekavaks which always either warped or booshed of. Mostly we managed to tackle and kill a few stragglers and booshers, but even bleeding numbers they were grinding the fort slowly but steadily down. Our Muninns where mostly skirmishing with the Jackdaws and Nagas but we didn't have enough tackle to really hold something down. The Nagas were a big problem because whenever the drekavaks had to ping they paused the timer on the fort.
---
After more than an hour of intense fighting the fort went down with 10mins left on the repair timer.
---
After there where some skirmishes but mostly it was over. Several structures including a tatara and azbel went safe during the fight. Our russian brothers lost their forts and quite some assets but safed their home and most of the caps including a hero vehement who refused to safelog for the fight. 
---
As the morale was a bit low before the final fight because it seemed kind of hopeless as many reinforcemnts didn't make it in we were quite happy with the outcome. Also the language barrier didn't make the organisation easy at all. Of course the attackers can also be happy as they killed both forts including the faction fort. 
---
We live in wormholes with no asset safety and everyone knows that evictions happen so nobody is totally safe. We wouldn't want it any other way so we're not salty at all as we do our own fair share of evictions.
---
GF evil attacking russians ;) Next time you're getting more than a bloody nose!
---
Thanks to everyone helping us in our defence we won't forget. Special thanks to everyone ragerolling 3 evenings with us without getting in.
---
TLDR:
---
Evil russians attacked good russians and explosions happened
---
Yes. They are doing fine too. 
---
In software there is no Instant death unless you are a security issue... Windows XP’s took 20 years to die.. end of lifing software is a slow process..
---
Ultima online took 5 years post UO:R release to die etc
---
Awesome. Tempelman still flying with them? I seen he is still active in eve.
---
Just like ragepings. "100 in alliance but 20 in fleet!" the FC rages. "It's a fucking shield timer structure bash we won't follow up on for the armor" everyone thinks to themselves quietly.
---
Hopefully turnout is better than that for the 10k test because there's a very real potential for payoff if things work out.
---
Not sure. I haven't flown with bb since a long time
---
Oh hey, the clock actually changes...
---
yyiiiippp yiiiiipppppp
---
The irony is that the subcap pilots only don't matter because there are enemy subcaps present.
---
If the opposing party didn't bring subcaps, you could easily do a lot to swing the tide of a titan vs titan brawl in your favor (taking down FAX being likely the main factor, clearing tackle too I guess).
---
It's a bad idea, this guy is just dumb and paid for it. Competent players who flew that ship solo ran it with a Railgun and sat at the edge of abyssal web range.
---
loved that video :)
---
There were bots 10 years ago, there were even more bots 5 years ago. Its the balance fault. Stop defending shitty development via reeee bots
---
i for one, have learnt to trust and love CCP's choices. i have ALWAYS enjoyed the ups and downs to balance changes, the issue is there hasnt been any. i love the game due to its changing, and new meta feel that used to come at least every 6months, at least.
---
i am holding out on my 3 accounts subs until i whitness the next balance changes, hoping for somthing dramatic, even if it goes wrong or doesnt work, if its a big change im happy.
---
AXAXAXAXAXAXAXAXAXAXAXAXAXAXAXAX. 
---
Not funny.
---
People only show up for "content fights" then sign NIP's and go back to Rorq mining a month later. 
---
eve has a lot of technical bottlenecks
---
the client was built ca 2000-2001 so process multithreading and memory usage are both very poor by modern standards. the graphics engine was updated in 2007ish and it's fairly non-shit, but the audio system is so memory/processor inefficient that most players just turn it off
---
Dude it's been dead since 2015 😑
---
yessss more polyphia in eve videos
---
YES I love it, the amount of spreadsheets I've done for it is insane
---
Loved it. 
---
it will at some point.
---
NC, PL, PH are fading away  and when they will be insignificant enough to ignore, Goons and Test will turn around and stare at each other in the eyes.
---
Then it will happen and it will be Epic.

 C4 WH space is poison to children's minds and it creates a fake world  for them to live in, they think they are safe from HK and LZHWK seeding  250 caps in their azbel, or from the inevitable 60 man TDSIN gila blob  out for their rorqual but they are wrong and delusional, this will  happen. C4 causes radiated autism which created  anime and furries and  this introduces pornographic material at a young age and has very  graphic and violent scenes which rots your children from the inside.  This carries over into adulthood and creates these lazy, nasty, hideous  slobs that were once your children that now sleep with an anime/furfag  body pillow at night and read mangas at least 10 times a day, this was  caused because C4s take a long to time to scan to find content and this  rots the brain, just like spodbrain. C4 scanning also consumes your soul  and wastes time that could be used to go outside, get 60 minutes of  fresh air, do homework and contribute something to society. The people  who live in wolf rayets are not the problem, C4s are the problem, think  about it, if C4s were deleted, the current C4 corps would move to the  next cancer, Wolf rayets, and kill the current degenerates using stabbed  cerberus (after their reload killed like 7 sabres of course)  living  there. C4 WH space is the root of all problems, cancer, war, Africa,  anime, furries and Nazis. Since people have to scan sooo much for  content  on the monitor screen for hours, it uses electricity and is the  reason why the oil reserves will run out soon. C4 space causes cancer  because it has been proven monitor screens emit radiation and radiation  causes uncurable spodbrain cancer. spodbrain has caused war by inspiring  the Nazis to side with the Japanese through their cartoons and  establishing the Pacific Front in World War 2. African leaders in Africa  are corrupted by spodbrain addiction inflicted in C4 wolf rayets as  well anime and furry influences caused by this and they cannot tend to  their peoples needs and cannot feed them. Future generations of  wormholers will be ruined and destroyed by the C4 influence. Everyone  thinks the downfall of humanity will be ourselves, but in reality it is  spodbrain C4 rorquals . After the atomic radiation, the Japanese wanted  to get their revenge on the world and created their ultimate weapon C4  wormholes, which led to the creation of anime, furries, nazis and  commies.

Look for Ghost sites.  If you think this haul was good, you might just freak out.

YOU STUCK A FUCKING GRAPPLER ON A VINDI 
---
Are you saying that docking up in Jita, begging for ISK in chat and then making billions with trading only is not an adventure?

Not unless you own a venture 👹
---
Ah yes, you must have a lot of insight on the matters
---
Please do tell more
---
so you ask why does he sell at a loss? well, i would guess he bought at a lower amount than you think possable.
---
skill all of them, you'll need it at a later point, guaranteed. beside that, the focus heavily depends on what your activities are and what playstyle you prepare. best i can suggest is to get a brief idea on the different tank possibilities and weapon types that those ships can use. afterwards you download a fitting tool (i do prefer pyfa) and start playing around with different ships to get an idea what they can actually do when you skilled them. afterwards you write a master thesis and become a master of spaceshiptheory so you can apply to make a doctor. but step by step. in a few months you might have gathered already enough knowledge to make a decision. :-P
---
good stuff mate :) fingers crossed your next one is one of the juicy 80mil+ cans

Jesus Christ how horrifying

WE LIVE IN A FUCKING BLACKHOLE AND GRAPPLERS ARE NOT PENALIZED BY THE WH EFFECT

came here to shittalk, now i think that is a good idea. fuck you OP, i want to shittalk. take my upvote and leave me alone.

Yes, but it this is the part of finding it. I was just saying that he can do it when he is ready.
---
&gt; E LIVE IN A FUCKING BLACKHOLE AND GRAPPLERS ARE NOT PENALIZED BY THE WH EFFECT
---
&gt; REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
THEN WHY FLY A VINDI OVER A MEGA NAVY?
---
Good times. Eve is real. I was there haha
---
That’s what happens when you have big balls but small brain. Surprised it took so long for this guys to get baited and killed seeing how dumb his fit was and how predictable he was.
---
fake news :)
---
Its just buzzword way of saying that it is an OS layer on top of large number of servers. In other words, present to the application a "single system" and then run that on large number of actual servers, in theory distributing the load automatically.
---
In theory sounds sweet and could do wonders to something like EVE.
---
In practice... extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.
---
спасибо
---
Obviously you should bring your alts. 
---
How to SWAT yourself guide by /u/CSMprogodlegend
---
That is because WoW stopped caring about being able to support a lot of players in one location. Instead they just infinitely phase the areas so once a pre-determined limit is hit, it just spawns another copy of the area and seamlessly distributes you across the phases.
---
Good talk
---
And it shall henceforth be known as, World War Ree.
---
Nah you get it right that’s an awful idea. Even without polarised weapons the most stupid thing you can ever do is to design your at ship fit around fighting in scram range in the first place. The second one is to be predictable by using it repeatedly in the same area and same tz on similar targets. Was just a matter of time.
---
AT THIS STAGE THE MEGA NAVY IS PROB MORE RARE AND MORE EXPENSIVE THEN THE VINDI. YOU ALSO HAVE THE NOT BLINGY VINDI SKIN!
---
Looking at most of the replies on this thread  ...in fact on this whole sub, that may not be a bad thing ;)

Well, there is also serenity. But yeah everyone else is on the same shard.

Thanks for the SAAR tip.

You are the old Derek Smart. Which is also the current Derek Smart
---
Aww yeah, It cost me a ship, but this is what I hauled out https://i.imgur.com/EHWp826.png that's like 6-700mil right there.
---
It’s missing chromosomes and it has extra chromosomes at the same time. I think it’s specially, unusually retarded.
---
So uh, tell me exactly what you mean by every loss there involving at least 100 people, with the majority being 1000+. All of the popped keepstars in Jspace involved capitals - broken-ass ships that need to get nerfed into the ground faster than you can say "increase the drone loss range on rorquals from 100km to 500km, ccp, or i quit".  
---
  
---
The only groups that can field that many people are nullbabies. Not the highsec people that don't like it. Not the wormholers that have to grumble and deal with it. MAYBE lowsec, I honestly have no idea what's going on in lowsec. But you've done nothing to make me think that hisec keepstars can pop...  
---
If you think that the game can sustain itself purely on the whims of the people that like big N+1 bullshit, you're technically right since the people that like that are also the people that have rorqual alts and beg CCP to not fix the rorqual. In the process, you drive away all the people playing in small groups. 
---
Thousands of speed tanked VNIs send their regards.

To me this seems fairly well written. They introduce the partner, explain the reasoning behind the project, as well as the potential gains. All without the article becoming a technical analysis of either EVE or Hadean.

If you interprete excitement as buzzwords, thats too bad - it's not like the future EVE couldn't use a little optimism or dreaming.

They don't exist, you're the only eve player left. The rest are bots.

That is so so good, show's it to the lad and his response was that we are all weird lol.

Ty for sharing &lt;3
---
I guess he asked it becouse in other games many time they not make a new, 64bit bot, and works only with the 32 version of the game (Aion is  grate example for this).
---
So some people already recommended the rule of 6. Good advice that but here is some other good advice.
---
First of all if you right click your data hacker you can select ''turn auto cycle off'' this means that you activate it once and don't have to wait again if you fail.
---
The second advice is to ALWAYS kill the regen nodes as soon as you spot them.
---
Dude you cant forget Talwars. Its Jon btw in case your wondering who random poster is

we sure a re wierd :)

The gold magnate was not an AT ship, it’s better than that. But yeah generally if you use expensive toys in this game you better watch out for these asteros.
---
Come on, these are just cute little newbros flying around in shitfit asteros, nothing to worry about.
---
No, every adventure begins with telling aura you don’t want to do the tutorial.
---
That's 2 complaints too many
---
07
---
it's stressful to watch someone with not much experience do hacking. Every click I was like "NO, not that one!", "No, no kill that fucking node right away!", "Rule of 6, don't run along the edge!!".
---
Thank you for the write-up. Always nice to see some insight, you seldom hear about Russian space politics on Reddit.
---
I agree, remove caps from lowsec (except for 0.1 so you can move and store them) and also remove citadels from warzones in fw
---
Remember, you can’t argue with a woman..
---
The idea is it's better to say something like "Okay I want to to fly cruisers", so you can train all the cruiser skills to 4, then all the medium guns/missiles/drones to T2, then finish off the cruiser 5's. Then move on to a different class ship.
---
Infact that was literally my path when I started playing, minmatar T2 frigates &gt; all t2 cruisers &gt; all battleships with t2 guns &gt; all t2 destroyers (this timed up right with T3 Destroyers coming out so was perfect).
---
The problem with this is that they don’t work like normal stargates because, in general, not everyone can take them. With a stargate, you could potentially catch them on the other side. That’s not a possibility with jump gates. 
---
I'm not sure if you're trolling, but 11 is the daily downtime where the servers are off for 15 minutes.
---
Because you can’t jump through an enemy jump gate like you could a stargate. This means that you’d have to actually split your fleet 8-10 jumps apart to pull this off, which only serves to encourage camping and discourages actual dynamic gameplay like roaming. 
---
removing damage caps will be an advantage for the big guys (IE Goons) too. 
---
I may be late, but definetely noticing a trend of posts/comments that are to distinguish between troll/not troll
---
Thanks )
---
Agreed :( 
---
I dream of a hard reset to be honest.
---
same for me, tried logging in at 11.05 eve time but just got a message that the socket was closed, guess we finally got here? 
---
Wow i love inner hell now
---
That's a narrow view of the world don't you think? I can tell you by experience that is not the case. There are tons of people who don't speak a English in Latin America that own very  good PC's and have the means to play EVE with ease, to be more precise anyone with a middle class adult income can easily be an EVE player, to put it in math terms if only 1% of the "1%" tried eve.....that's 40,000 players. 
---
Why do small gangs need a way to kill capitals within their home sov?
---
oh so that's why BTLH is hated by everybody
---
Or, you know, you can just drop one into space like a normal dropper.
---
Because if a capital ship can't kill a small gang, it deserves to die.
---
Where did gold Magnates come from?
---
:shobon:
---
Cool, I'm sure everybody will just have a "time out" while that anchoring timer happens.
---
Do you even realise how easy it is to defang a carrier?
---
This is how it ends
---
Lmao @ the sauce pans, I actually agree hahaha
---
I clearly remember this video (the original one) being uploaded many years ago with the title "CCP fixing the servers" (something similar to that)
---
“HIC doesn't see a tons of love and only offer a niche”
---
Yeah, you are definitely drunk, go sober up
---
I love this! Spasibo!
---
Different for all of them. C1s can be completed with 250-400 ish DPS, C2 I'd recommend 500-700 (can be completed with lower, but I do not recommend), C3s 600-1200+.
---
Keep in mind I am not talking about breaking a sleepers reps, but actually killing them in a reasonable time. Sleepers do not have a lot of natural reps (though sometimes there is RR ships which is a much larger problem)
---
I did not run many C1s myself, as they don't pay much for the risk of Wormholes. Also keep in mind that values for DPS may vary depending on the site. 
---
3rd one could be a salvager.
---
Which should should I look into Skilling up first? Downloaded the game a couple of hours ago and a guy gave me a destroyer and a Miner and told me where to mine and do agent missions.
---
That sounds like a great plan for a newbie thanks a lot for the comment.. 
---
Done it plenty of times, I'll give you some tips if you want. I'm pointing more to the more realistic scenario of the locals dropping 6 Nyx's onto a 10 man cruiser fleet.
---
There are not that many Spanish speaking players because there is no UI for it that is the hole point.....How much do you think a localization of the UI cost? and with all the recent advancements in translation AI....how can cost can be an issue anymore? heck you can even crowd sorce it you go the cheap route. 
---
OMG AGAIN? EVERY DAY, EVERY FRIGGIN DaY!
---
OMGWTFBBQ
---
...
---
Eh, you got a point, but it doesn't HAVE to be HICs. My premise isn't crazy. 
---
Tbf, these comments are not from ccp, these are from discussions I’ve had with the aether engine devs, their goal is to make it quick and seamless to move onto their OS
---
And?
---
Pretty sure deep spase and time crit were always coming. You guys are basically a alliance at this point. 
---
I like the idea, however the ship in the bubble then has to be immune to scram / point. If you want to keep it there, bump him...
---
But your idea needs counterplay. 
---
cus moving into a region next to delve that is covered by the initiative (aswell as various groups from goons, tnt etc) isn't under protection?  
---
honestly the spin people put on stuff is amazing.  
---
If bastion moved to branch with no support id be impressed but moving to another system thats basically under the same peoples skirts is nothing but more of the same.
---
Is this a genuine post? Like are you seriously posting unironicly? That you didnt like a group evicting a small non pvp group in wh space. You know the thing your group is famous for?
---
Yeah, that is called established defense.
---
If you want to whale in a zone secured by super capitals, better be able to fight them.
---
Desperate attention whoring is pathetic.
---
Inner Hell just gained a fan. :) 
---
Glad the Imperium supported you in the end. 
---
Is it going to be easy though? Killing carriers relies purely on landing on them in the 30 seconds they’re aligning out or the 20-30 seconds they’re in warp. If they are still getting up to speed and see a hic landing on them they still get the choice to cyno before the hic has landed.
---
Ratting carriers also get the choice of fitting a cap booster so that if they land on a site and neuts then arrive 5 seconds later they can just jump to a cyno beacon...or pulse their nsa to stay above jump cap.
---
If you minmax safety in carrier ratting there’s literally a 20-30 second window every time you’re in warp where they shotgun a site that this would change anything.
---
So basically if they shotgun systems there is a 1/20 chance (30 seconds at 10 mins a site) of catching you at exactly the wrong time and that’s not even factoring in intel channels completely slaughter those odds anyways.
---
This is post is about as free of Russian collusion as the last US election....

I'm offended, I fucking love HICs

Why shouldn't they defend their space with a strong enough force is beyond me.

Really shouldnt, they do the exact same things to small pvp corps, they were just looking for an excuse to shoot at botl
---
I'm glad you understand how you sound to the sov holders.

I know, Goons .. brainwashed ... bla bla.

But look at the facts, look at the MER, not produced by Goons, You can see in there what are the powers of tomorrow.

I am not saying that goons will win the war against Test,  but i do believe there'll be a war.

It depends on what you are interested in! Look at some ships you want to be able to fly and look what you need.

If you are not sure yet, base skills in engineering are always good and useful for all ships you may fly in the future. (This includes Capacitor upgrades, powergrid upgrades, CPU Management, Navigation skills are also nice, if you want to go for a specific ship you can skill that ships ship skill level - &gt; e.g. Gallente Frigate, Mining Frigate or others of that kind in the spaceship Command tab)

In contrary to my flair, I actually don't mine.

Bruh, me too, wish I had more excuses to use one.

Well, i know they (we) will do bad stuff to other people on EvE, but show me anyone who would not. 
---
I know that the decision might have been to help the defender just because and the main reason for Imperium involvement was that "guys are getting bored again". 
---
I am just glad, that in this case, the big guys decided how they did.

No it's not the same. Now it's one man show and BB is being used for private interest of one dude which cmping systems with his 100+ alts 24/7. I remeber the times when BB was really fun now it's just a cancer.

It’s fine, all this stuff is going to be rmted out eventually. Like Russians have built supers non stop for years and years when they controlled the drone lands and any of them is yet to be seen. Rmt strong sink.

I still love the game and many ppl forget it's all about who you play with and what you do. Sure if you sitting on station and your main activity is shitalking on Slack or comms then yeah for you it's already dead.

I was shaking my head reading this entire thing.. This reponse can be summarized in a few points:
---
1. Buy lots of PLEX
---
2. Don't be new
---
3. Only WHs or Rorqs with many accounts make decent money
---
4. Also, every single thing a new player can do is a waste of time.
---
5. and for the love of God, dont be new!
---
This is basically the recipe that is killing EVE. What is wrong with being new? Its not a waste of time, its a fun learning period that should be embraced!
---
I know that we're a bit off-topic from the OP, but damn.. If you've really earned a trillion farming whs or multiboxing rorqs I think its time for a change of waters for you my friend. I don't know of anyone who has that kind of money from just grinding, and if I did I'd hate myself for not helping them move on.
---
You provide little proof of these infractions. I would say you just simply are trying to justify an eviction that was completely one sided.

Well done on the eviction.

For what it's worth if you're at this point you're over the worst hump for training. Training all the core powergrid/cpu/capacitor tank skills is by far the worst part. Everything you train from now on is either letting you do or use something new, or making it significantly better!

No one wants to kill capitals easy. All we want is for the capital proliferation to stop. Every roam / small medium fleet is countered by capitals.

you can pretty much do this by extending eve to multi-monitor and offsetting your ship centering to your main monitor.  the one drawback is if your monitors are different resolution, it gets kind of wonky.

You can never be sure on this sub. :D

Like before warp to zero when you could still force PVP on gates.  They could have come up with a much better solution than WTZ for bookmark copying/selling.
---
Like before Jump Freighters when we had to form escort fleets with standard freighters to move stuff in and out of null sec?
---
Like before the game wide 25% ship agility increase when everything took a lot longer to get into warp?
---
Like before every type of ECM in the game received repeated nerf hammers until force multiplier ships are practically useless?
---
This game has been getting incrementally easier and easier and easier over the course of it's entire lifespan.  It's not like one or two things from recent history are completely to blame.

You used to have to work your ass off to live and survive in this game.  Now you can have two brain cells rubbing together and never lose anything.

As much as I dislike his koolaid sperg most of the time, he is right here, the graphs you linked are way to short in timespan, you have to watch from the implementation of "Lifeblood" until now. And there he is right. Before the patch nearly all mined R8/R16 Goo was collateral moon miners on POS used for other stuff (Staging/Safe/Reaction/Prod-POS). Often collected by people who would never mine actively. This supply is totally gone and was only slightly countered by Hisec-Moonmining. On the other side people who create Rorqual-Multiboxes are mostly min/maxxing people that have no interest in mining ticks lower than 100Mio ISK/h per Char and so usually only mine Collossals and R32/64 Moons. Also the amount of mined R32/R64 Moongoo in Lowsec has dropped as it is dangerous there to mine actively (far more than in any Nullsec).

I think I was already talking about it. Mar5meca is the only one who was avoiding the conversation.  
---
It's uh..
---
Very busy. 
---
An example:
---
Planetary Interaction has the potential to be a fun mini-game that you look forward to doing. I like the idea of extracting and producing things on planets.
---
What we have now with PI is a repetitive activity, where you have to click a bunch of stuff every time you reset extractors etc. I doubt anyone thinks PI is actually fun, after the first month or so of doing it.
---
There are many things in EvE like this where there's potential for fun but the execution of it is so poor that it ends up being a repetitive, boring activity very quickly. Mining and High-Sec missions are two other examples of such activities.
---
Huh, didn't realize the time on Eve was global standard. Always assumed it adjusted to time zones.
---
I remember him from Did He Say Jump, sad that he is gone. 
---
What an honor that would really be for the deceased person. Good on you all for just showing up though 
---
Well. It will break all the current memory scanning bots. But I don't think it will take more than a few days after the 64 bit client is available before they have adopted... 
---
Trig, Guristas and Mordus imo are the most op.
---
Guristas: stupid tank + stupid damage
---
Mordus: kite for days
---
Trig: reasonably fast, high damage (stupid damage once spooled), reasonable tank
---
Sansha: niche but fun ab bonus with projection
---
Blood raiders: more of a fleet ship imo. Fat, slow, but great utility 
---
Angel: speedy with small sig and good projection
---
Serpentis: niche, wants to brawl bc of web bonus, makes a good hammer
---
Soe: tanky and versitile, can cloak
---
Minmatar: speed, decent projection, lower damage but selectable, multiple tank options,
---
Gallente: fat tanks, like to go face with high dps, drones and kin/therm weapons
---
Caldari: mediocre speed, amazing protection with Missiles (rlml op) , mediocre dps but selectable. Also have kin/therm boats
---
Amarr: fat tanks, slow, decent projection and damage but em/therm locked, decent drone boats too. Few kite ships, but some good ones. More fleet ships imo
---

First hack, you almost had the core, when you uncovered the antivirus. It was in the middle of a set of 6 nodes. Kill the antivirus and it would have been on one of the adjacent nodes.
---
Nice can, but wait til you get the big fat juicy 80m+ relic cans! And don't die...
---
You're sorta late to the party on that one. Aether Engine is pretty much an early stage knock off of SpatialOS by Improbable IO. 
---
Dozens of MMOs using their architecture are already slated for release and all are claiming single shard gameplay. "Mavericks" being one for later this year, will be a 1000 person battle royale.
---
The reason CCP didn't go for SpatialOS I presume is due to the fact that a simple lift and shift of eve's core code wouldn't yield any gains due to the python bottlenecks. Which is why they are partnering with someone who is just using their texture assets instead of their mechanics and code.
---
It died when they legalised buying isk. And then let you buy skill points.

---
It’s my goal to feed quality memes to the neck beards! 
---
Fine; removing damage caps will be an advantage for the big guys, and a disadvantage for the small groups that Eve is missing right now.
---
You say that, but whilst we were constantly rolling (3 days for 6+ hours a day), we did the maths...  
---
There are (523 C4 wormhole systems)[http://anoik.is/systems?systemclass=c4&amp;staticdest=&amp;effect=_unfiltered&amp;shattered=_unfiltered]
---
We were looking for a specific one: J115031
---
Our odds of finding it on each roll were 1/523 or 0.0019%
---
We rolled an average of 1 hole every 6 minutes, leading to ~10/hr, ~70/session
---
We came across the same system multiple times, we even came across juicy targets along the way but held ourselves. 
---
(At one point there was a bit of a skirmish with a goon harpy fleet that had been scouted into our rolling hole.)[https://zkillboard.com/related/31002477/201903051800/]
---
All-in-all the odds were against us, but as we were batphoned by another group who were assisting, we decided to show up and assist.
---
As we got close to the final timers, Hole Control started organising the last defences on comms as we listened in - it sounded quite positive for a little while, the munins and dreads sniping off Zarmazds, Leshaks and Drekavacs. But in the end, it just wasn't meant to be... Inner Hell had the numbers, had control and had the persistence, fair play to them :)
---
As a long time FW player I suggest joining a FW Corp. It will make life more fun for you, give you support and knowledge, and you can always solo if you want.
---
For every offensive plex you complete, you can cash out LP (convert to modules/implants and sell at a hub), and buy 2-3 decent fitted frigates. So it's pretty easy to have anough income to support pvp.
---
Be aware that high sec trade hubs in regions of space controlled by the enemy faction will not be accessible to you due to fw police (crappy concord, but potent nonetheless). Example: if you're gallente/Minmatar jita and amarr will be off limits and you will have to use dodi, hek, rens, etc.  A neutral hauling/trade alt solves this problem. 
---
&gt; i can assure you that supercap fights during the most recent war would've been great content,
---
My primary issue with this is that there just aren't enough supercap fights. 
---
These would've been great content for like a whole 10-15 hours of playtime (though any individual pilot would get into 1-2 of the fights on average). 
---
We fight one of these big wars every 2 years or so. That's less than 10 hours a year of reliable content, with an 80 billion isk spaceboat as the buyin price if you want to matter much. 
---
This would be OK if supers didn't do so much to *reduce* the number of &lt;1k player fights we get; but the presence of supers undeniably suppresses content in a lot of areas, from smallgang to strategic cap brawls (because why commit caps if you aren't prepared to back 'em up with supers, and it's very rare that both sides are prepared to drop supers on the same objective). 
---
So while these are good changes and all, I'm worried CCP still doesn't get the need to focus on supercap balance to encourage content at all levels of the ship spectrum, instead of just focusing on improving our occasional titan brawl experiences. 
---
Ill let my corp know 
---
GF BL - thanks for bringing content.
---
o7, Cyno will be lit. 
---
Increase the EHP of citadels by 10x and remove the damage caps, disallow DD use on them. 
---
Now dreads have a role 
---
you sound like you rorq mine all day 
---
Every FC has their own style.
---
Orange fan mad
---
It was just a typo in the initial announcement. There will be a 64-bot client for EVE now.
---
Yea according to the MER, NCPL literally dont even exist anymore. Stupid fucking "elite pvper" pubbies LMAO
---
I love the part where he says it's the simplest game to learn to play. I've played on and off for 4 years and still know Jack shit 
---
Yup, too many big words for OP to handle.
---
Well made!
---
Recently came back from a multi-month break b/c things had gotten stale. Long time FW pilot and have been having a good time in the "dead" warzone. Because fw died the content has been a lot smaller, which suits my tastes. That said, you often have to roam a little further to find it, but if you're in small ships (also my preference) then it's nbd. 
---
Small gang roams, terrorizing our local region, picking fights with bigger entities.
---
But really its the Bros that make eve fun for me. Been flying  with a lot of the same dudes for years now. 
---
The suit makes him classy. He goes home to his wife and kids after a day of marauding, shooting space ships with his machine gun, and riding dinosaurs in space.
---
It's sometimes hard to tell if troll or just dumb.
---
I started eve back in ‘13 after seeing a reddit thread about a new corp called Brave Newbies. Videos like these inspired me to train cloaky and link up with Lollipop Guild. Old-school bombing runs during that summers Provi War is one of the best gaming moments I have. 
---
I still get messages from the folks in The Beer Room to remind me of my newbie days in Rahadalon. 
---
Zkill shows the russian blob is also responsible for many evictions
---
I think people need less reasons and more lol we shot your shit gf let's do it again 
---
It's not "just making the server multithreaded" either.. That's basically writing all what Hadeon OS says it provides, and then re-write the EVE servers on top of that.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/MwBgoIQ.png](https://i.imgur.com/MwBgoIQ.png)
---
Yeah, it's the rewriting of the eve servers what looks like a very hard project. If the "POS code" or a 64 bit client have been such a problem to deal for so many years, this looks orders of magnitude more difficult.
---
??? Dude we've been living in wormholes for 4 years without anyone extorting us. We've had eviction attempts against us, sure. But we've won them.
---
I've al ays flown snowflake shit in fleet that tends to double as decent backup fc ships.. I don't know how much isk I've lost ejecting so pgl can have a ship after getting headshot..
---
What's a good corp for an exploration-oriented player? I was very interested in Signal Cartel, but they don't allow their members to engage in PvP. I understand that philosophy, and may yet apply at some point. But for now I want to experience the full game a bit. They allow you to use an alt for PvP, but training an alt from scratch and juggling skill points seems... unappealing?  Am I being dense here?
---
I feel like I'm probably missing out on a lot by not being in a corp, but I have no criteria for choosing one other than the random solicitation mails I get. Recommendations appreciated.
---
Challenge fucking accepted. 
---
It's not the injectors.
---
It's the extractors, that are sold for real money / PLEX.
---
But CCP had to introduce it, to overblow their value for a buyer (in this case PA).
---
Killing the game was not a problem for CCP, the last investors got their money out the shit they made
---
You're posting on an EVE forum, so I'm not sure how drawing the line there makes it any "cooler" for you. 
---
Tbh, this post is as objective as it can be.
---
Can you escape a Titan's targeted DD once it's activated? I checked Pyfa and there's a "damage delay" on the DD modules. Does this mean that DD isn't instant and you can e.g. jump out before the DD 'lands'?
---
Any chance of a recovery? Would love to get OT back like the old days. Was so much fun.
---
Wait you’re celebrating a successful mission by bragging about 60b in resources, ore and drones?quality achievement right there. 
---
It does directly transfer.
---
Serialization delay = packet size / transmission rate. This delay can be much bigger than the 20-30ms added by distance. 
---
small group that doesn't exist in nullsec and have a space made for them : Wh oh waow 
---
Thanks for the overview of each faction, this gives me a good insight appreciate it it
---
Regardless of what you think of all his drama and shit, you gotta love this guys enthusiasm, it was always a blast to go on his fleets  
---
If this allows CCP to focus on rewriting the EVE backend instead of also having to write all the low-level/primitives of making a distributed system, I think it's a good thing.
---
CCP has 4 years to prepare a tiny, tiny lightshow.
---
I used a split damage Rail/Blaster Rupture, with active shield and armor tank back in the day.
---
A change to citadels affects lowsec as well as nullsec.
---
Exploration is mostly done solo. You could join a Corp that lives in Sansha’s space, and have easy access to it. But then you aren’t allowed to explore in space owned by people blue to you, so you might be better off in a neutral Corp if you have trained into covops cloak. 
---
So, it really doesn’t matter. The only consideration is that if you’re alpha and want easy access to Sansha’s relic sites, you should probably join someone in Legacy Coalition 
---
I mean, Nexon was not wrong about assets being stolen by other players. 
---
It's lottery-boxes, not loot-boxes.
---
Loot-boxes are in, the lottery not (yet).
---
You asked who he was?
---
Yes, there's a 10 second delay until the damage applies (9 seconds spool up time, 1 second server tick).
---
You can get out of the way (in the case of lance, boson, and GTFOs) or get off grid (jump or warp) during that time.
---
If the target lock is broken during that time, I believe it also interrupts it (i.e. if your titan gets ECM jammed).
---
yes
---
Phoenix got nerfed.
---
/u/MASHAandBEAR just phenomenal you have made my week where can we Inner Hell merch. I'm totally a fan now!!!
---
Viewers system-wide in UALX-3 also report an unrelated, dark spherical object between the telescopes and the pretty titan explosions, which completely hovers the view for most observers. Astronomers and scientists seem to agree that the unexpected spatial phenomena is most likely your mom.
---
This is the dumbest speculation I've ever seen
---
Nope, eve time is GMT. So it goes out of sync with the UK when we switch to BST.
---
remove the ability to fit warp disruption modules on ships with cynos, unless they are covops?
---
means carriers can still fit cynos, but you dont get the gnosis, dominix, mega cynos that are too common etc, instead, see tengu, it means cyno is comming again, it used to be see a tengu, you knew what was comming
---
How does preventing alphas from doing level 4 and level 5 missions prevent people from botting rorqs and carriers?
---
You can camp plexes quite effectively tbh as they are behind a restricted acceleration gate and you can’t cyno. You still need a brain though so you can balance what to engage and don’t lose randomly your  chremoas to two hookbills. Magni also uses a kitey fit that stays out of range and can always leave. He is predictable though and died for it once already 
---
Purely from a hypothetical perspective, if time dilation occurred, would that also impact the speed at which the light from B-R5RB traveled?
---
Second question: will it it travel fast enough to strip past Manny's regret for triggering the whole affair?
---
One of my old corp members was from that area. They do exist.
---
My biggest question is: what determines what ships you get to fly? Will everyone be in Valkyrie fighters with capital ships as a backdrop? Or will random players get spawned into Avatars for the hell of it?
---
Are asteroid belt rats stronger in lower security systems? I have had no problems killing them in 0.6 systems with tier 1 drones, but don't know if I can handle them if I go to low-sec or null-sec.
---
Also are there any recommendations for a null-sec corp / alliance that accepts new players (just over 1 million skill points) that want to focus on resource gathering and industry production?
---
You say free for all, I say bomb them all
---
rorquals make almost no money compared to vni, so nobody wants the drones
---
It doesn’t transfer directly: there is an additional variable of packet size and you still get physical world overhead that isn’t influenced by it. And that’s before even discussing our data model for networking.
---
When discussing network latency in absence of indication of packet size, we’re discussing a minimal packet roundabout. But even with 65Kb payload, bandwidth added latency becomes negligible at some point. You can squeeze about 160000 such packets into 10Gb/s link sequentially in a second. That’s 6 microseconds - 3 orders of magnitude below our preferred unit of measurement.
---
You are technically correct in your argument though. Hell, I can take it to absurdity: move latency measurement a layer above and write a payload generator that never stops writing one what I now call packet. Infinite latency!
---
they triumphed over a traditional foe. it could be 1isk and still mean the same  
---
what they really mean: it will be a 0.00001 tidi fuckfest with servers crashing in the end
---
Nice, thanks!
---
Rorquals killed: 44
---
Value: 191.98 billion
---
 
---
Mining drones (both types) killed: 199 (193 ore/6 ice)
---
Value: 169.33 billion
---
Over the course of 6 days, which leads to an average total of 360x5 Billion isk so 1.8 Trillion Isk of mining equipement killed over a month.
---
In January, the amount mined in Isk was around 45 Trillion, therefore the current attempts at managing the massive production of ores by Rorquals is ineffective.

Well, comparing to all the "golden" ideas we have here on reddit, this definitely is not that bad actually.

no

RULE OF SIX! PRAISE BOB! 
---
Maybe a year or two. Depends how stronk the spin from the NS blocs is. 
---
This whole thing is just marketing nonsense
---
I haven't lost an arm, brother. It's right over there!
---
This whole thing is just marketing nonsense. These hadean people paid CCP for the exposure
---
Until it stops making a decent ammout of cash.
---
I don't even think there is 10,000 people left playing eve that would even care enough. I'd be shocked if this gets over 1000
---
So you rate cringe...good I got a question for ya.
---
So which is faster a kestral with an overheated  mwd or a swipe left on your tinder profile..in game I mean?
---
lmao'd hard
---
really depends on how well they can counteract the playerdrain by coming up with stepping up the need for alts to stay competitive and P2W mechanics like injectors. will also depend how efficiently they can move services away from a a company owned and expensive to run and maintain cluster. there is a reason they´re going for cloud services and that´s cost reduction. if they manage to pull that off i could see this game running for another 5-10 years inhabited by plenty of whales and EmPIrE bUilDerS. if the cloud concept doesn´t work out they´ll probably pull the plug in the next 3-5 years.
---
hm...i'd say ~4 to 5 years of active life.  followed by maybe 10 years of "dead" life where only the extremely dedicated players remain.
---
of coarse, this is based on no competition coming out which would shorten its life.
---
and based on no major improvements or turnarounds that improve performance, player retention, balance the economy, and slow the titan influx. which would increase its life.
---
&gt;Tbh, this post is as objective as it can be.
---
This post - about BTLH  and UNKOWN.  
---
"Evil" russians got lot of stories about "goodnes" [like that](http://forum.eve-ru.com/index.php?showtopic=52277&amp;page=824#entry4020100) short episode
---
I am sure that if you ask the rest of the "evil" Russians, each of them will tell his story about BTLH or UNKNOWN goodness (except for LSH &amp; Goons who just flew to fight)  
---
&gt;Thank you for the praise of the divorce o7  
---
(c) "Good" russians
---
No love for whsoc? :(

A week or 2 tops, contract all your stuff to MechaJeb Kerman for recycling.

С английским надо бы подружиться. У всех native speakers он вызывает чувство неестественности. Предложения бы сделал покороче, рублеными и односложными, было б гораздо лучше. Это в рамках конструктивной критики.

TL;DR: your English is very good, but might be better.

Beaut vid, great kill.

I will put aside my love hate for Snuff and its members, 22:10 eve time saturday. cyno will be lit. ill see how many dudes i can get to light in respect around placid
---
ITT: inhe claiming moral high ground
---
i guess the time dilation is a very local phenomenon so, once the light succeed in getting out of the TD zone, wich, even at very strong TD levels won't take more than few seconds/mins, the rest of the light's travel will be at the actual speed of light (and probably curved near very massive object on it's path).
---
TL,DR : hypotheticaly TD won't have much effect compared to 9 years...
---
It doesn't help that they are doing it on a fucking Wednesday
---
Right now, rebuilding a corp and an alliance with old buddies and start a war with some locals. The last 3 weeks of my eve playing have been so much fun
---
&gt; (and probably curved near very massive object on it's path).
---
So, hypothetically, TD won't affect the travel time, but your mom could?
---
Nope, the last guy from BB management that was trying to compete in using BB for his own purposes is considerded to be an enemy no 1. I mean they still have lots of kills so if u just want to particpate in fleets and shoot big stuff just go for it. But if u think about hunting it's all about roliing wormhole now and getting to region in range of Mar5ys alts which let him to harass locals and get his payment.
---
For ratting, I really enjoy missiles and drones, so Gallente Battleships for the Dominix and later Caldari for the Rattlesnake was an easy choice, and that's been the deciding factor for most of my training into ships - finding out which factions have ships available for the type of combat (or other content) I enjoy. 
---
Subscribed, clicked the bell and SMASHED the like button!!!
---
Minmatar all the way. Stiletto, Hound, Tempest, Sabre - it's all good stuff.
---
player base has been flat for a while.  Plex inflation is just normal and is good for the game.  Titan meta doesn't exist (how many titan battles have we had over the past year?). 
---
I just bought a new Ryzen 5 2600, on the box it says it has thermal paste applied. Is it OK to plug it in as is, or should I get some new paste and apply it? 
---
yep, thats exactly what you sound like xD
---
GISTUM? Wow, it was too poor to live anyway.
---
What do you need to do a ghost site?
---
Are they in nullsec.
---
Are there enemies
---
What time? And what time is that in eve time?
---
I reckon we'll see 20 years
---
It doesn't sound like it's going to be like EVEs combat at all, just the art and ship models, much like Valkyrie.
---
It looks like it's just a stress test for the Aether Engine to see if it can match or break CCPs record of 6,142 players in a single instance.
---
My guess is they will get some basic Valkyrie-ish type combat system, very basic shit, and use that as a testing base.
---
I wouldnt go into this looking for an in-depth pvp system, not yet at least.
---
EVE won’t die anytime soon! It will live on in our hearts and memories until we die.. 
---
If they took the opportunity to also implement ASLR into the 64-bit client it might make it more difficult for them. 
---
Another one
---
x
---
I fit my worms with augmented drones...
---
By the looks of it there was a couple hundred bil of stuff they destroyed instead of looting
---
Yeah does this guy not see us English speakers constantly shit posting? Lmfao
---
Instead of worrying about it just give me all of your isk and take a break. If you decide to come back just message me and I’ll send double back to you. 
---
bad time to be out and about in an at ship
---
3rd AT ship of the week
---
I like it!
---
How actively/intensely does one generally have to play before being able to afford PLEX monthly with just ISK and not real-world money?
---
Imagine needing to spin a narrative for a wormhole eviction so you can put on a song and dance for the goon retards you brought along lmao
---
Age of Ascent stress test v2.0, it's sounding like.
---
When they came to us, they got &lt;1000 people on there.  I suspect this will lead to much the same.
---
I found a hundred million can in a worm hole but I ran out of scan probes so I had to self destruct.
---
I knew that. Its not exactly secret knowledge.
---
 What you are referring to was meant with a wink and anything but serious (smileys are used just as well as here). Except of that, its just an analytical AAR.  I understand that instead of dull propaganda, spinning and shitposts, these things have become rare.
---
I'd forgotten it was BTLH that evicted Ducklings, so now I'm kinda glad IH did this. 
---
PR manager for IH though, lmao. 
---
Imagine going through the Catch permacamp area in your solo AT ship. He's not even instawarp with that fit + pod.
---
That is pretty damn stupid
---
Why shouldn't there be a way to counter this though? 
---
Are you all so trash at the game that you can't defend your assets if you're unable to cyno?
---
Wow vanilla was the most casual MMO that existed when it released.
---
Dude, not hics but something capable of roaming fast. 
---
How about giving that ability to combat interceptors since they are totally outclassed by assault frigs.
---
Seems great can't watch it tho
---
Why do capital pilots feel like they should farm risk free?
---
Where in there does it say they are moving to the same architecture and server software as twitter and facebook? My point was that simply using a cloud solution like AWS does not resolve the issues with EVE.
---
I am talking about software. Whole sale game engine overhaul is going to be required. Moving to the cloud doesn't magically grant you performance you don't get from on-prem solutions. What do you think a large scale on-prem solution is?
---
So this changes absolutely nothing about your argument or mine, but keep trying to self righteously wave your internet dick around, you're just making yourself look stupid.
---
I like this idea\^\^
---
Serious changes are needed. Eve won't die, but they need to fix the whole caps vs sub-caps issues. These ship types need separate objectives. Let capitals be the sov machine that keeps and takes sov and helps destroy structures. Let sub-caps be the machine to cripple the enemy's space. Destroy their economy and moral. 
---
As a side note, they need to do something about afk cloakers. Cloaking needs fuel. 
---
Is moon mining more lucrative than astroid mining
---
But they don't? 
---
There are plenty of risks in space that isn't secured by human effort.
---
Insisting to go where the supers watch over the ratters with ships that can't fight said supers is a you problem.
---
New salvaging variant
---
&gt;The eve is dying mostly comes from the fact that eve isnt the merciless landscape it used to be.  Asset safety, cap umbrellas, panic modules, and citadel mechanics have undermined the conflict drivers of the game.
---
Then again hardly anything happened in null back in the day. No industry, no real infrastructure apart from some scattered POSes and stations, no real mining, and people were too afraid to rat because shiny lossmails would attract attention from groups that might think your corp/alliance moons would be easy to take from you, because you lose shiny stuff on the regular (ignoring the fact that it could just mean you had a huge income and flung around shiny stuff just because you can). 
---
I think if we had todays mechanics from the start, the capital balance could be better, and we could have had zero SP requirements. 
---
Its financially broken that it costs me 90bn to inject a titan pilot, but 45bn for the hull. And insane that it costs 50bn+ for a fax/dread alt and 2bn for the fit hull. When you're flying a 40bn isk rorqual pilot losing 10bn in drones and ship is nothing. But if your rorqual cost 50bn and there were no SP requirements, there would be more risk. And same goes with titans, titans should cost 150bn with zero SP requirements. Faxes should cost 10bn+ and no SP requirements. 
---
&gt;There are plenty of risks in space that isn't secured by human effort
---
Enlighten me
---
I mean, UO is still chugging along.
---
The people who hunt said ratters?
---
Who the flying fuck cares about the cool-kids-club thats CSM? Its just a PR-gag that for some reason keeps getting told.
---
But you just said theres no point in hunting ratters because of a supercap umbrella...
---
To be fair, they destroyed considerably more than that rather than hauling it out. 
---
This is what I wish they had that way people actually had to defend their resources
---
Idk, really, should there be? 
---
Maybe, but if it ws to exist, such a measure should then not be available to everybody and should need a special ship or tactic to be used, which in turn, should make the gankers more vulnerable to other means of destruction. 
---
&gt; Are you all so trash at the game that you can't defend your assets if you're unable to cyno?
---
Idk, really, i let you be the judge of that, you seem to be keen about deciding that anyway.
---
Do you have a graph of the "player drain"?  Or similar?  I understand these things are also somewhat seasonal, i.e. there's no big war going on at the moment and that tends to reduce the omega count somewhat.
---
&gt;in space that isn't secured by human effort
---
you forgot to read the 2nd half of the post
---
&gt;A lot of people disagree with the direction the game is heading; there appears to be no real sense of loss anymore. 
---
Could be that a fax alt itself costs 45bn+ to inject and the fax hull costs 2bn incl. fit. And a titan alt costs 90bn and a titan costs 55bn incl. fit. Hell if I lose my titan I can extract a fax alt and buy a new titan, even if I get no SRP. And I'll still have fax alts left. 
---
I'm not talking about it compared to other MMOs but vs itself.  Last I saw of someone playing it, everyone has gear that used to be only available to people that had spent months farming.
---
I'm not saying it was ever hardcore, but its progression was similar to eves in that it became easier and chose convenience over inaccessibility.    
---
The "dead life" sounds fun.  You know, space mostly empty with small and medium-sized gangs fighting each other.
---
So, by this definition the OP should have said "gf" to the drones, then moved on. Therefore, the OP is a salty post. 
---
Absolutely!! I use to mine 5-10bill twice a week from R64 moons that we had cycled once a month
---
I love this game. It’s better than my immediate reality of politics and hate speech. Thank you for this post. 
---
ok can i multibox 5 toons?
---
That's what you get when you cram 47k krabbici into a single region
---
Training magic 14 and other support skills reallz is a chore. But i think it also should be.
---
Try going to nullsec(join a Corp there)
---
I did nullsec mining in a venture and made a million isk each time I filled up the cargo hold. You should generally compress your ore before you sell it (makes it be worth 20% more) and use https://ore.cerlestes.de
---
To find out what ore will get you the most money.
---
Not all goons are miners. 
---
But are all the miners goons? That is the question.
---
It really isn’t. The game feels empty.
---
See mabinogi
---
Whatever CCP does with their money that doesn't directly go into working with this outdated piece of shit is bad.
---
Like trying out new stuff that could benefit eve online, it's bad because it cannot be directly complained of for glitching the game, instead they bitch about ccp doing... anything.
---
I’ll look into it
---
fuckin falcons, nerf ecm!!
---
Nice post, fellow zkill user :)
---
Oops, mommy can I borrow your credit card!
---
GG simple farmers
---
i saved them tons of money with my answer then
---
Couple years, but the closer to the end it gets, the more the game will suck
---
Oh, fuck those guys. I am not playing some unfinished beta on my wednesday, no sir!
---
ok im confused. lets start over:
---
you: why do small gangs want free kills?
---
me: why do capital pilots feel like they should farm risk free?
---
you: they dont because there are risks in space that arent secured by human effort
---
me: :thonking: hrmm i wonder what non-human risks are there in space. enlighten me.
---
you: people who hunt ratters
---
me: :confused: people hunting ratters is a human risk...
---
so, care to clarify here, please?
---
What would UK players be doing down in Virginia Beach, anyway?  
---
(I got jokes!)
---
Meh ded game  wts imp 2 trillion isk
---
sounds like it has potential to be fun
---
Right on! Here's a tip: Right click your analyzer modules and set auto-repeat off. Then when you fail a hack you don't have to wait for the cycle to end before you try again.
---
Imo unless you have the numbers and the will to make a very bold move across all WH space - like rent holes, hog the c6 magnetars, run constellation farms etc, like HK used to do (or maybe still does) OR you're a dickwad who crawls away from fights, runs his mouth without reason, is known to stockpile etc. AND don't have the numbers, the knowledge and the will to stand up to whatever is thrown at you, you will probably piss someone off and get evicted. 
---
Imho there's a few major reasons for eviction   
---
1. Challenge - you issue that voluntarily or involuntary - "unassailable wealth" etc. 
---
2. Loot - this is a bit harder to achieve but with spies etc, it can be pulled off. It would be a larger "occupation-like" op. 
---
3. Smacktalk - some banter is well ok  and some salt is acceptable but getting offensive, talking shit, bragging, threatening etc. will trigger the right people into teaching you a lesson 
---
4. Excessive carebearism - rolling away from fights in such a measure that you get a reputation of doing that will also trigger some eviction attempts
---
5. Dickishness - running exclusively cancer doctrines, overstacking logi, refusing fights you can't decisively win and generally being a dick will also see you put in your corner. For some it's easier for some harder but the comeuppance will arrive. 
---
The WH space being so empty and fickle it's pretty hard to establish dominance so paying the local honcho is not something that's done, as far as i've heard. That doesn't mean some won't ask sooner or later, but I find it's very ... not difficult, but cumbersome to enforce. 
---
Fortnine? PUBG? 
---
But....... In space? 
---
Ugh. NO!
---
WTB Trig dread
---
Bored players also work harder to break the game and stop caring about consequences.
---
CCP will stop fixing exploits or persecuting abuses, likely leading to some crippling bugs being used and not mitigated. Things like item duplication, infinite currency generation, infinite resources etc...
---
I used to play Anarchy Online but it has been in a state of "dead life" for years now. The hackers took over and there is no more meaning to the game for a normal player.
---
So CCP looking for new tech that would let EVE run faster in certain situations and possibly free up more processing power for more complex possible interactions is. . . . Bad?
---
Ok then.
---
I contracted it in Jita, best price!
---
I can't believe I am forced to explain this...
---
There exist space besides places like Delve, where supers get dropped on frigates.
---
If you insist on going for ratters in a space like Delve, better bring a bigger ship.
---
If not, better find another place to figh.
---
You don't go spearfishing into water full of sharks without the proper equipment.
---
That's r/eve for you :P
---
To add:   
---
WH space is like an ecosystem and tends to self-balance in a very nice way.   
---
I think everyone who lives there should find a way to contribute to pvp - it's even easy to do so, with the lack of local. If everyone would have the decency to provide a fight of any sorts when you roll into their home WH space will keep on being a good space to live in.   
---
that being said, WH space is also a super safe space to rat and live in, if you're a bit careful. You can maintain it that way but you're not contributing to the ecosystem, you're just piggybacking on it. In which case some entities may decide to purge you, especially so if you're touching one of the points above. 
---
I will fly an excavator
---
STOOOOOP DIEING IN MY FAVOURITE SHIP ... FFS I am saving isk for years now an u just jack the price up -.-
---
I think at Vegas someone mentioned this idea as a possible additional T2 BC ship line and Rise did seem interested. 
---
Don't listen to that propaganda stuff. We have a lot of FCs, big and small fleets. A big mining alliance (Has like 80-90% of all mining in eve) is mad that BB sometimes kills their miners. It's like in the old days when people dying on a gatecamp accused us of hacking. :D
---
What's the game genre even? EvE? Valkyrie? FPS? 
---
&gt;just having one openly admitted manipulated election by the usa
---
lol get on my level, south america btw
---
Looking forward to seeing these released along with the Angel capitals
---
11am PDT which is 1600 game time I think?
---
To be fair I have played since beta 6, 2003 so when you say "feels empty" I don't think it means what you think it means.  Space "feeling empty" is a good feeling, as space is big and some parts of it should feel like that.
---
He takes local banter as if it's a personal attack... I wonder how long he's been playing Eve exactly.
---
lol I meant that they would get a lot more people on a weekend than midweek. 
---
inb4 its a trig rorqual
---
not empty in that way. empty as in a dark depression hole formed from nostalgia vs the empty game that feels like your alone despite occasionally coming across another player
---
1 million isk!
---
Plz Trig Fighters
---
We aren't talking about the prices since lifeblood, we're talking about since February 18th. So you can set that graph to 2 weeks to get pretty close to the 18th, and see that the r16s and higher that Q was talking about have mostly dropped in price.
---
I see.
---
Not a good time window... Weekend would be much better... Sad face 4head 
---
Heh. I remember back in my CO2 days we'd call you guys "Inner Welp" for all the feeds against our dirty faggot rorqs. 
---
You guys get good? 
---
oops then you are f****d ... extended Monroe-Doctrine basically says you are not allowed to tie your shoes without asking the big brother or "regime change" kicks in like in Chile, Honduras, Grenada, Nicaragua etc.
---
I mean it too, i have more time on weekend, wednesday is busy and i am usually not in the mood to try new stuff. 
---
*wink wink*
---
And 10,000 plex
---
I would think it's maybe an upgrade system based on what you score. Or maybe a currency that you stockpile that you would use to buy your next ship. 
---
I would go for it that way, for starters. 
---
&gt; "It feels a little balanced already just by virtue of introducing it"  
---
It feels balanced because it's new? what?
---
lol, so you judge market developement on shortterm spikes that 2 Traders can cause wit 2 days of market manipulation? Well then no point in talking about economical developement of the moongoo market with you. Sorry that I tried to get this to a fact based discussion, will not give reasonable answers to your content-less sperg posts anymore ...

why so aggressive and mad

papa goon not give good treats?

Precursor Capital Industrial Ship ?

Feel the love but also, since we got to talk  - take the points above into consideration: Orbit at 2500, spam dscan, if you're going battl-y fit for it and just leave one spot for one hacking/relic tool (refit at a depot), data sites have shit loot and far away cans.
---

Just another idiot idea coming from CCP. Another failure in the making. Another embarrassment. Another over-hyped pile of garbage that nobody asked for. Another waste of money and other resources. "No micro-transactions or loot-boxes".... yet.
---
Thanks for the write up.  The thing is I remember being on evictions with both Inner Hell and Hole Control/BTLH.  Many long hours of sitting on wormholes being linked Russian music videos often with midgets.  
---
Sounds like relations with the groups broke down at some point and former allies now hate each other.  Kind of a shame.  
---
You can’t say any one group is “evil” for evicting anyone as they all do it.  
---
&gt; Why exactly do you think you're credible again?
---
Were they ever?
---
I mean, they're on record as saying they wouldn't charge RL cash to pay for things that help player progression in the game, that they would only charge RL money for vanity items. Hilmar stated categorically that the Fearless memo was out of context and that they'd never do such a thing...
---
And now we have Skill trading for the golden geese.
---
The pet/tribute is a meme ^^

Strange game. The only winning move is not to play.

Care for a nice game of Apex?

2013 was peak. Fountain war was the shit.

I hope we get some spooky lore to go with this, I miss the days of the drifter lore and caroline's star. Really made the game feel alive

Check out the Discourse and look into what’s happening in Semiki - there’s absolutely something big building up in the world of EVE concerning the Triglavians and Drifters~

CCP doesn´t release those numbers. There is the PCU of cause which is not always indicative of subbed accounts or a games health but is the lowest it has been since 2008 with a steady downward trend for at least 4 years. There is a solid theory (!) that the number of alts/bots is way higher than it used to be because of injectors/alphas/scalable potent PvE content which is hard to quantify but logically sound. So even with dropping PCU numbers the amount of actual player is potentially even lower than it was in 2008. There are stats that indicate that this subs (as the main/most frequented discussion hub) average number of comments has decreased by 55% in the past 5 months alone (which can´t be correlated to player numbers directly but is a solid hint that people are losing interest in the game). A lot of top of the line content creators who have been around forever have left the game in the past 2 years. etc etc 
---
Reddit is always kinda doom &amp; gloom which makes it easy to discard the usual eve is dying sperg. But to say that Eve would be in a healthy state right now would be dilusional. 
---
This is a thing of beauty.
---
Middle of the working day for me.
---
Looks like I'll be busy
---
MY BODY IS READY!
---
Alphas can skill into VNI's - with good skills you could make 60 million ISK per hour in a decent null-sec system.   
---
Currently, 500 plex costs around 1.9 billion, which would require around 32 hours of ratting, assuming you don't lose any of them. That's around 7-8 hours per week, which would be the equivalent of a decent part-time job.  
---
Mind you, once you get to Omega-status, there's other better options, AKA carrier ratting or Rorq mining, but those both have long trains, and involve more risk. You can skill-point farm, but that's not always super-profitable, and you don't get much character progress.  
---
In short, it's better to make real-world dollars and pay for one or two subscriptions. 
---
&gt; There exist space besides places like Delve, where supers get dropped on frigates.
---
Nobody said the contrary
---
&gt;If you insist on going for ratters in a space like Delve, better bring a bigger ship.
---
Lmao okay
---
&gt;If not, better find another place to fish. 
---
Again, nobody was saying anything about Delve specific
---
&gt;You don't go spearfishing into water full of sharks without the proper equipment.

This is the first post I've made in a month. Laugh a little. It's funny. 
---
The art is pretty cool, where does it come from ?
---
Obviously if the game isn't played exclusively or in the majority by people that live regionally close to me it is dying. That's one way to look at it.

But lets be honest that is a pretty damn good image. This isnt your normal r/eve bad crop and past thing
---
I think we will get a better idea in the next 6-12 months to see if that korean company is going to dump any money into it. If not I would say maybe 5 years max

Charlie, hit the support ships. And Saul, scan out that Proteus, I want my power plant back.

I'll be curious to see how much laughing Darkness does when the agreement lifts this month for murder time.

Cool

People who have to beat their chest and yell at the top of their lungs that they don't care...
---
So getting back to capitals and krabs deserving risk free farming due to game mechanics, since that was the original point, if you can't see outside of your little viewpoint on why that might be a wee bit overpowered in this video game, then I really have no business trying to converse with you.
---
&gt; How much do you think a localization of the UI cost?
---
Enough for CCP to stop caring about localization for certain languages. As I said, if there was a market for it that could be tapped, they would do it.
---
I mean, look at your subreddits for Eve in Spanish. They're all dead.
---
All I'm getting from your end is "REEEEEEEEEEE FUCK THESE PEOPLE WHO BUILT AND MAINTAINED A SAFE AREA I CAN'T GET FREE KILLS IN REEEEEEEEEEEE"
---
All i'm getting from your end is "REEEEEEEEEEEE FUCK THESE PEOPLE THAT TRY TO KILL MY SHIPS, I WANT TO BE ABLE TO FARM WITHOUT ANY INTERRUPTION, CCP PLEASE FIX, REEEEEEE"
---
goes both ways :)

I have quite clearly said you are welcome to bring proper equipment to fight us, haven't I?

okay this conversation is over

There's a bunch of memes of US presidents blowing things up - I grabbed this one of Reagan, and turned it into Brisc. I might do a few more before the end of this campaign season. 
---
Thanks! A different perspective!
---
Sounds like it will be closer to Valkyrie? There's a screenshot in the Rock Paper Shotgun article that shows a simple armor/shield HUD.
---
didnt eve see that, link? 
---
That’s a pretty decent quality pic tbh. I can appreciate that.
---
the types remain at their strength (corpus pope etc) but better types have a chance at spawning the lower sec &amp; even truesec (?) gets. so it will get more difficult the lower in sec status you go
---
So it's a play-date? Kind of like taking the kids to the park.

It's been a hell of a week.

especially to get 6142 within eve many were likely flying multiple ships.

Body double. I can clearly see both of his hands.
---
There is nothing preventing an Alpha from doing lvl 4 missions. I have an Alpha that runs them in a Rattlesnake. The skills needed to fly rorqs &amp; carriers are Omega &amp; that is what keeps people with Alpha accounts from flying them. There is nothing preventing me from trying a lvl 5 in my Rattlesnake except my desire not to lose it.
---
Come on man, it's just the one occasion for testing the technology. It's not a framework for a new type of EVE. 
---
&gt; and turned it into Brisc.
---
does one always speak of oneself in the third person?
---
Yes, asteroid belt rats are stronger the lower you go in sec status, and the difference between rats in a 0.5 or 0.6 system and a 0.4 system is significant. 
---
You might be able to kill some very minor rats using T1 drones in low-sec, but I personally don't think belt ratting in low-sec is something you should aim for regardless― even efficiently run (i.e., being able to kill all the rats that spawn), the ISK/hour is comparable to level 3 missions IIRC, and it's generally much more dangerous to rat in low-sec than running L3 missions in high-sec or ratting in a null-sec system your alliance has sovereignty in. Null-sec belt ratting is much more profitable, but you'll generally find battleship class rats, which *definitely* aren't killable with \~1 mil SP.
---
Many large null groups will accept completely new players, and have people that focus on mining and industry as well. I'd suggest looking into Pandemic Horde.
---
Thank you
---
Well, I could have turned it into me, but I turned it into my character in the game instead...so...
---
This needs more eagles.
---
guys think about it what the point of don't polarized it get 5k ehp or 10K ehp if you must die you will die , so better be polarized and kill the ennemy faster so he can't kill you , with that fit he killed astero withing 4 seconds , the only dumb thing he did , that was to do all those kills at the same place , but at least he undocked it and used it , a lot of guys here would have never undock it , or play it with pussies fly advert fit with 5 Griffin behind 
---
No he actually wants that you notice him.    
---
Russian speak, for "we going to fuck you up"
---
 The purpose of which was to put the corporation "BTLH" in the framework of norms and order. 
---
Trig dreads would be pretty legit.
---
20k dps after a 2 minute spool up? Would be great for small-gang dread ganks.
---
Not here to defend pgl, never flown with him, but. This is so far from expecting perfection that it's laughable. An fc expecting people to be capable of looking at a fleet, realizing there's a need for something, and reshipping to meet that need is asking basically nothing.
---
Unfortunately asking the monkeys to do anything more than undock, anchor, press f1, and collect their pap link is waaaaay too much to ask I guess.
---
I understand.  Interesting.  
---
yeah then get killed by astero drone , he  fight only astero with it so he build it against astero .... you're the one being stupid here 
---
There are many alpha bots in Hisec and lowsec that farm missions, particularly courier missions. By making them available to alphas only, it will discourage these botters from continuing. This obviously will have no effect on botting carriers and rorquals, and it isn't meant to. It just shuts off a different corner of isk-making from botters.
---
How does it looks like ?
---
Boson activating in 3...2....

Oooh thank you

For those who missed it and wonder what he's talking about.
---
eve is dying, amirite
---
You are correct, I know the “atleast he undocked it” phrase gets thrown around a lot but it’s true, I rarely undock my freki and imp be wise of the fear of losing them, even though I could replace them, I don’t want to lose them. Just should not have been used in the same place in same time zone so often, kind of like the whiptail that died today 
---
Haha! That's new to me but i am not surprised! We've been called gooncontrolled when we bombed other people and had maybe one fc with us who's been in goons, then PL pets(?), it seems to switch around every 6-12 Months. Atm, the theme is that one of our FCs is somehow forcing us  to kill capital ships in the area where 80-90% of all mining happens.
---
It's a one-time tech demo, I don't think they're seriously gunning for EVE: Battle Royale
---
I've been "Winning EVE" for a while now, and Aether really rekindled my interest.   
---
Lots of the technical problems within EVE seem to stem from the engine being too old to properly maintain and upgrade. Legacy Code is still something we hear about now and then.  
---
While I understand that there's quite a leap between "Tech demo for another company's new engine" to "Integrating that new engine into our game", but I'd like to support even the smallest steps possible in the right direction.

You get a lot of use and efficiency out of one ship. Money isn’t usually an issue for WH groups so you can fly these more expensive t2 and faction hulls and get every last inch of one pilots use 
---
More vulnerable to other means of destruction?Generally already fighting heavily outnumbered in hostile space, if you can't defend against ~10 people in your own space without caps . . .
---
Pot, kettle, black.

Triglavian dreads that spool up to do 30-40k to supers and titans? SIGN ME UP PLEASE RIGHT NOW.

Where did you get the day from? All I can see is that it’s going to be during GDC

What was the actual drama? I always heard *of* it but anytime I asked no one ever gave a straight answer.

Now it is 3 AT ships in 3 days! That is for sure a record 
---
Right after they finish the tiercide 👌
---
nah
---
It seems people aren't picking up on your sarcasm

I imagine it will love long enough to see much more EVE is dying commentary.

It's the interesting nature of human beings disliking it when someone mimics their way of posting.

oh damn, is this an old-school style RP/PR smugpost!?

It’s not about cool just basic human dignity.

... and here you are.

Lol, shooting through a windshield like a retard.

can't wait for 10000 rorquals to all be in the same belt :poggers:
---
Thanks for the info. I'm not so much looking to kill the rats in asteroid belts, but more so looking to not have my mining ship get blasted away because I can't defend myself.
---
REFLECTIVE AND METALLIC, NOTICE ME!

Technically, Gold Magnate wasn't an AT ship.

Never do anything.

Well, Starscream always was a little bitch so...

I missed that. This will gave a huge impact on the market &amp; I don't think it will last. Without the ability to run lvl 4 missions there are a lot of people that will never log in again. Myself being one of them.

Basically broken until fixed. Annoying they remove the only way of getting around the issue..

Even disabling 2FA doesn't fix the issue and even then you have to wait until the next mirror to see if it works or not.

Well it is INIT.

this explains why they cease and desist the sins of the solar empire mod.. similar?

Loll

Hacking ship.  Foes will show up after a timer (starts on the first hack), and if you fail the hack the can will explode dealing damage.  They spawn in all but hi-sec (maybe even there?).  A properly tanked Stratios can do a site without an issue, tanking rats and all.
---
im not denying that...
---
Sounds like you would like a wormhole corp.
---
No structure comes with Corp Hangers pre-done, you have to rent offices to get your corp hangers.
---
Now your corp hangers are going to be the same as all your others, because you name and set those up through the Corp Managment window
---
Yeah fair point. 
---
3rd Tournament Prize Ship of the Week is probably better.
---
Yes. Who cares how fast a shit game runs.
---
Tbh I don't ccp is gonna care about losing a few alpha players over reducing rampant inflation.
---
&gt; in Providence we don't have rorquals and live an honest life 
---
I chose the latter and I'm okay with my choice.  
---
Is this standalone or...
---
How they supposed to contact the community without a community team.
---
Ahh, that makes more sense. That's further out of my experience, TBH, but I do know that mining in a null-sec system your alliance has sovereignty in is generally more profitable and safer than mining in low-sec, and the issue of belt rats is easily solved if you mine with other players in your alliance.
---
What the shit
---
You're basically saying you should get titan characters for free?
---
Do we REALLY need more titans in the game? Really?
---
https://youtu.be/WXoIhCJDcgg?t=58
---
If things continue as they are now, with no major changes, probably 3-5 years. I don't think there will be any real odds of dying in under 3 years. 
---
If CCP pulls off some groundbreaking changes, like this Aether program is aiming at, then I'd give it another 5-10 years. 
---
Whatever else can be said about this game, we have an unusually dedicated player base. Quite a few folks literally grew up on this game, and many have stuck around for 10+ years. That gives us some real staying power.
---
yeah  even triglavian need minerals, but i cant see them use  the ORE line to mine them. we need triglavian  mining ships , industrial comand ship(s?) and transport/freighters. \^\^

I'd actually want to follow up on this. Their is a work around that i thought was patched out

koreans have been playing eve the last 10 years
---
Just another whiner...
---
Yes, it's a single-use tech demo as far as we know.
---
I really hope ccp doesn't "balance" trig caps by making them cost 40 bil.
---
jesus christ all mighty, i guess people are just in the mood to kill AT stuff 
---
Have you seen how good Koreans are in other MMO's? We're fucked.

Spool up bonus. 500% bonus to mining yield per cycle. Max 50000%

I think you underestimate how much dmg it still does with rail + non-polarized torpedoes. You are a bit confused.
---
Hmm.. Looks promising, can you please follow up on this with your findings?? I'd check myself but I'm not at my computer for some hours.
---
Not so far ago I took a small cruiser gang in your space and you throw several bs bc and all kind of ships onto us, w your 2 to 1 numbers relative to our fleet you could have easily picked that fight w cruisers but no, you just had to overkill this one small group who was looking for some gfs
---
makes me think.  what will the drifters do seeing tri caps maybe there own capitals  following close behind ? 
---
This is a good thing IMO. It's just outreach to expand our player base to a demographic that still plays Starcraft 2 on a regular basis.
---
Want Eve to live forever? These dudes love super complex (and equally outdated) games. Sounds like a win to me!
---
Already tested this remotely on my machine it still works.
---
I would but it’s the middle of the workday on Wednesday. 
---
I literally used to make my ISK in game by creating "farms" for popular types of characters.
---
I assure you if skill injectors did not exist and people still used the CB, me and people like me would be filling the board with Rorqual alts.
---
cant wait to see number of iBeast lvl players wrecking shit wherever they go:)
---
Out of curiosity, why don't you Plex your account with isk? I've heard that level 4 missions pay out a lot.
---
Ah le gros delire
---
So you where able to bypass the login and use your account that was already logged in via TQ by switching the server in the settings?
---
5k vs 5k clusterfuck fights are definitely not my part of dreams, even if there is no TIDI.
---
Korea vs the rest of the world inc 😂..
---
Actually that doesn’t sound all that bad, it will be like two factions at a constant war with each other.
---
I love the car plate lol
---
All chrome and shiny!
---
We'll have to beg CCP to buff ECM some more, otherwise we have no chance.
---
I THINK YOU BOTH HAVE VALID POINTS, BUT I AGREE ABOUT THE POOR SKIN.
---
Just a few weeks lol
---
Vertical capital ship when? 
---
That made me laugh 😂
---
Oh, yeah. Good point. NOTICED
---
Your idea is completely ridiculous and OP.
---
You want to give a HIC, a ship that can hold down a supercarrier, a module that will prevent that supercarrier from getting help, while at the same time somebody in your gang can stay 30km away and light a cyno for your own capital back up.
---
GTFO and swap brains with your dog, you will gain both IQ and self-awareness.
---
think they call it Phoenix ...
---
Waiting for the freighters having a trucker hat on with a shotgun and using a car jack to keep the WH open while they shove more freighters through.
---
So Load up Launch &gt; Select Triple Lines Icon &gt; Server list &gt; Play on Sisi &gt; Enter username &amp; Password &gt; You are logged straight in without 2FA.

---
This will depend on how attractive abbyssal PvE will be and how much people farm the required components ... balance issues everywhere, hope they do it right ...
---
dont be jelly of my skills
---
Nah, its prolly a cap version of Noctis
---
Haha of course, I’m just joking. There were a string of shitposts that followed a real post of someone sharing their first capital ship after they had been playing for “10 years.” 
---
They were like, “Just bought my first frigate after 10 years blah blah blah.”
---
Anyways, mining can be fun when you add a bigger element of risk. Shooting rocks in hisec might get dull pretty quickly.
---
&gt;titans should cost 150bn with zero SP requirements.
---
Then the 52 killed titans in the X47 armor timer would equal 7.8tr destroyed instead of just 3.4tr (titans were 65bn or there about back then, fit incl).  
---
If there were no small cheap stuff in these big fights, there would be no tidi. Big ships don't cause tidi, **many** ships cause tidi. 
---
In the X47 fights I could pick between 1 fax+1 titan in the battle, or 1 titan + one subcap logi, I of course picked fax and titan. Now I can field 2 titans, 2 faxes, HIC/dic AND a subcap, but for sake of stability (not maxing my 16gb system memory) I'll probably only run titans and faxes next time around. If I didn't have a titan at all, I'd have to field like 100 battleships across multiple computers (or one really expensive computer) for the battle to have any relevant stakes for my in-game wealth level. 
---
If not titans and stuff, what would you suggest be the "end game" for those who accumulate in-game wealth? High-grade slaved navy apocalypses? 
---
Rgr, will test this when I get back to my computer. 
---
Thank you for digging that screenshot up, this gives me new hope for being able to join the next mass tests!
---
Vertical capital?
---
Yea for like 3 days until grind maxed toons and take over.
---
It all makes sense now
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/92551941
---
You can't get kills unless it's dropping supers on everything or a massive blob. You're just scared that once caps get nerfed and a reasonable balance exists, you'll suck worse than you do now
---
At least this time they are hobest and call it a tech deno instead of marketing it as a game like Valkyrie and Nova.
---
Just as a heads up this only works for Windows &amp; Not macs.

YES

I didn't know that was a thing, thanks. 
---
I kinda doubt they will all be 100% whales or have more whales than what we currently have.. 
---
But I still think it could possibly open up some more exciting content, even if it’s challenging, since nothing much seems to be happening lately as far as I can see...
---
But then again what do I know, I’m just a newbro and I’m just assuming..
---
They'll be balanced by building material availability, specifically, building mats found in Abyss. Hope you're good at T5 farming, otherwise, yes, they will be 40 bil minimum, prolly a lot higher since it will be the higher end Abyss runners that dictate those prices. 
---
Only the low end abyss sites can be AFKed and botted with super shitty drop rates, the higher ones require actual attentive play.
---
I have literally never given this issue any contemplation during my game play. And I’m mad at myself for reading to the bottom and then posting but I felt I must.  
---
The difference between L4 lots and plexing lots is about 1.5 billion isk. 
---
Until recently I didnt know there was no Korean localization. Who the hell made that genius decision? I'm never one to start harping on CCP about every little thing but seriously, cmon.
---
a computer that turns on
---
Depends, If you need to run them on max graphics you'll need a good PC, if you're ok with low quality, my ~8 year old i3 with 1GB Radeon HD7770 can run 3-4 accounts ok.  
---
Was the station player owned? Then it's a fortizar now, or your stuff is in asset safety somewhere in lowsec. If NPC station, stuff is still there.
---
Too much work. Have a skin instead!
---
(I like skins dont shoot)
---
Hahahahaha
---
guess im going to begin by speccing into mining. it seems noob friendly and am looking into the Procurer.

Not block in merica. Get out euro trash.

I know, but this will make literally all the Koreans to swarm in en masse. I'm obviously not serious, and really hoping this will bring in a few thousand fresh people.
---
Why would it not continue for a long time to come? People are still playing Dark Age of Camelot for god's sake.
---
Panfams last deployment was an absolute shitshow. They barely managed to hit provibloc. They're no longer interested in wasting resources deploying. 
---
They will sit at home and mine their brains out for the next 2 years to try and catch up to goons.... but won't.

Yes player owned. U-HVIX in Wicked Creek to be exact. 
---
Not sure how much I've got. A rorqual and a shed load of blueprints plus probably a bunch of ships I don't care about.
---
Thanks, I'll order the best graphics card I can afford and try to remember my log in details. I don't care about quality, for now, I just want to spend money and find an excuse to not undock.
---
Youtube is your friend.
---
EVE Online battle Royale basically, then?
---
You joke, but I think one of the coolest changes to mining would be blast mining. We already have it in the form of moon mining fractures. I've wanted a Rorqual doomsday module since I saw the fracture mechanic. Triglavians would fit it perfectly! 5, 10, or 15 minute cycle -- big ass laser that takes a huge amount of ore and reduces the rock size each time it impacts. That'd be cool as. 
---
Angel titan when
---
it'll make the euros and Americans switch their timers from "free Korean kills" tz to actual active time 
---
Could've sworn WHSOC were in a C5. I also deliberately limited myself to 6. I could have gone on.
---
No salt for you, just talking about the general quality level developement of the sub. It is nice that you wanted to help, but that does not deny the fact you got gold from someone for a wrong advice ...
---
&gt;and really hoping this will bring in a few thousand fresh people.
---
COwho?
---
WTB angel caps.
---
&gt; U-HVIX
---
I can't see any citadels there, so most likely your stuff is in a asset safety container, in nearest lowsec station. You'll have to pay 15% of the value to retrieve it.
---
Please, Mittani is a professional lawyer! 
---
first seeing the mail I had a freudian misrecognition - the ECM Symbol of the Falcon sprung my eye, making me think first its lumpymayo with his Burst Ceptor ;-P
---
Out of curiosity, what draws you to level 4 missions specifically? If it's the fun, not the isk, then wouldn't lvl 3 missions or day-tripping be viable alternatives for you? If it's the isk, then what are you trying to do with that isk? Folks here can probably suggest alternative ways to get the resources you need to keep doing your thing.
---
Because it would take me almost 50 hours of hardcore mission running to buy the Plex at current prices. That's a part time job &amp; when you put that kind of grind in it stops being fun. This new policy will drive up prices of everything. Where do you think all the T1 modules come from? They are not being manufactured. This is a testament to the poor programming skills of CCP. It won't address the real botting issue which is in null being done with Omega accounts.
---
&gt; Fortnine? PUBG?
---
&gt; But....... In space?
---
For only 1000 PLEX you can buy the Carlton dance for your Jackdaw!
---
It should be made from salvaged parts from other ships + a blueprint.
---
Would be an interesting design. Dread bombs are one of the place where trig design would work against a trig ship. They'd be awesome at killing supers / titans in one cycle. But quite bad at taking on 20 Revs.
---
Also when you log in, check the character screen, if the fortizar is gone, you might be in space. I sure hope you aren't in the rorq.
---
Back in my day you had to escort a fleet of iteron Vs (that cost 100m to rig) (and 100m was allot of is) 50 jumps through lowsec and 0.0 (which were actively camped) NO SMUGGLER GATES. Pos fuel was different parts (no blocks) anchoring pos mods took 20 mins. 
---
There was no asset safety or safe EVAC you fought to the last pod (which costed money to replace)
---
EVE WAS HARD. The new kids these days dont understand how hard it was, and that's why we're bitter
---
Nyan Katsu is a really good name. 
---
I came here to write this &lt;3
---
Will do. 
---
So if you are low skill, and want to get into rescource gathering and industry, you could try salvaging after carriers/supers. It’s really good money if you sell the scrap, but you can also try making rigs out of the salvage for some industry experience.
---
This has literally nothing to do with that
---
Nah, I’m blasting my lasers.. Nobody knocking on my pos
---
Problem is thats s mustang. Typcial cant stay on track
---
That's a pretty cool thought for a sci-fi universe actually.
---
EVE has FTL travel, and FTL communications (thanks to Azbel). Those ships travelled lightyears in seconds to fight and die in B-R5RB. Afterwards, word of the slaughter spread out to the greater galaxy in minutes if not hours. The Scope ran a piece on it within days. Most of the galaxy could have conceivably known about the massive loss of ships, including the families of the non-capsuleer crew members aboard.
---
Tonight, in UALX-3, almost a decade after they have mourned the dead of B-R5RB, the families will point their telescopes upwards and watch their loved ones die.
---
Would be a fun solution to titan proliferation if it only got the super damage boost vs supers
---
Your palm trees really set the mood, thanks

Good and evil are silly adjectives to use. Tossing in my 2 cents no one cares about, of the two russian groups here, one seems to be practically dead most of the time, and yacht rolls their WH every time we connect to them, and the other fights a lot more, and just blew up a lot of BTLH's stuff. As the norm goes, someone gets evicted, and people scream about how XYZ is killing WH space, but i don't think WH space really lost anything here.  
---
For a corp that has been in WH space for so long I expected a significantly more put together defense too. These guys were literally in the POSPY eviction, and saw first hand how useless a cap blob with brawling ships was against a mobile subcap fleet with some ranged abilities. So maybe I shouldn't have been surprised, but still, I was when it turns out their defense plan seemed to be....a cap blob with brawling ships.

I really don't remember much about look to windward apart from the setting. I should probably reread it.

+1 from me
---
I don't think the contours you referenced about do's and don'ts paints an accurate picture of wormhole life, because most corps just do whatever they want without paying any attention to those "rules".
---
It's true that those are the reasons why someone is expected but most don't live in fear of crossing those rules.

We're a very carefree bunch living in the wild West. We ain't got no time to be worried, Sall I'm sayin!

Plot twist, I don’t have a pos but I’m still blasting my lasers tho.. 😂

I basically exclusively run Abyssals now and have a great time. 
---
In a Gila you should have a pretty easy time in T3s. Passive Gila is typical, and I typically run exotics or firestorms to play nice with the Gila's missile bonus types. Exotics are faster but filaments are way more expensive than Firestorms due to the extra armor your opponents get (slowing down clear times).
---
In T3 you can expect to earn around 100m an hour on average if you sell everything. Your 'paydays' will come from mutaplasmids, t3+ filaments, and best of all skillbooks (can be up to 300m). On average, I'd say you will make 30m per T3. It seems to be about 50m per T4, and around 90m per T5.
---
Regarding the extraction nodes, they can be worth it but not so much in the lower tiers. In T4 and T5 you can get up 13 or 15 million per node, but it never felt worth it to me in a t3 compared to just running more sites with the time saved. If you fit a MWD and head to them while killing NPC anyway, it can be a good way to make a little extra ISK while killing NPc. Some people use mobile tractor units and send a drone to each node at the start of each zone.

Yeah, use one to scope out the system and check if the fort no longer exists, and the other one to light you an out cyno when the system is empty.

It's the ISK, the LP &amp; the challenge. Lvl 3 missions pay out 1/4 of what lvl 4 missions do. I currently have almost 2B in ISK after purchasing &amp; fitting out my Rattlesnake. If I run lvl 3 mission in the Snake it's no fun &amp; a waste of time. I purchase Daily Alpha Injectors almost every day I play. Running lvl 3's would put an end to that.

A bit off topic, but here we go: the thermal paste is pre-applied on the cooler that comes included with the CPU. You can't re-use it with another cooler. Most aftermarket heatsinks come with a bit of thermal paste, though it depends on the manufacturer and model.
---
In most cases the included paste is decent but not great (with some exceptions like Noctua heatsinks) and you can always replace the pre-installed one. 
---
A standalone syringe of paste is good for 5-10 applications and has a long (3+ years) to infinite shelf life depending on the type.
---
tl;dr if you're using the stock cooler you don't need paste, if you're using an aftermarket one check it's specs.

People are getting way too excited over this without being able to read, I think.  We're basically stress testing another company's engine using EVE art assets.  It will be a neat tech demo, but will likely not play like EVE, and the odds of it actually affecting EVE are slim to nil.  I get the feeling a lot of people are going to be very disappointed when they eventually realize this.
---
You'll definitely get blasted unless you have a procurer/skiff, and even then there's one type of rat that will probably repair more than your DPS called clone soldiers.
---
Nothing will point you though so if you're active you can always warp out.

I'd be more concerned about getting into low sec and finding a system to mine without done crazy-ass player dropping a entire wing of blops or a super on me.

I AM ALSO YELLING
---
I understand what you mean, but don’t you think even if they spends hundreds or thousands that won’t necessarily make them better/stronger than the current vets? 
---
Yes, we have a Korean corp in TEST. As far as I can tell this announcement is just about giving the Korean community more support, hopefully encouraging more to join/play. 
---
Eve will run on a potato

I think your undershooting, I think when you finish the noob tutorial you should get a hold filled with injectors and a free Titan in you hangar as reward

you know ... that would be a nice thing to have.

Do sleepers deal true 25/25/25/25 Omni damage?
---
Not 100% sure but if you didnt play for couple of years you should have an option to contact ccp support and request to be moved to different system on rorq char. Might save your ship, one time offer though
---
&gt; It will be a neat tech demo, but will likely not play like EVE
---
So what you're saying is it circumvents the most common /r/games complaint about EVE?
---
oh god no, if they need more high-multiplier skills for injector income they should be filling the powergap between subs and caps, not introduce more HAW caps with tracking like a drek against a frig.
---
Given that it's an anti-war story, it might be a bit odd in the context of actually celebrating B-R!
---
maybe it helped respective person, maybe i got it because reddit is a fuckin troll gathering?
---
probably a little bit of both i reckon
---
Compared to MMOs at the time, yes.  But it had actual goals and the endgame content was actually hard, with much better gameplay than similar MMOs of the time.  Now, the gameplay has been dumbed down to not even be fun, and it is more casual than Candy Crush.

1. Is there a way for me to set this subreddit's flair to my IGN?
---
2. Are there corps that would rent manufacturing space near Jira in their Upwell structures, and is there an easy channel or place to find these contacts?
---
3. Our small corp is considering buying our first Upwell structure for clone swapping / offices / storage but are worried about wardecs. If an Astrahus is properly fit and actively gunned, how large of a fleet could it hold off with a handful of on-grid ships? I'm having a hard time figuring out how good at defense citadels are on paper. If it's defensive capabilities are a joke, we might go with the manufacturing citadel instead.
---
Isn't the cost of buying a daily alpha every day about the same (or even higher actually) as buying omega? And they give about the same amount of SP. So why not just buy omega?

Bumping because I'm tired of using evemarketer and want something better.

Like it would be nice if it only collected the ore at the end of the cycle if it did that. But knowing goons and test, we would abuse the fuck out out of it.
---
Yea due to how fast dreads/fax/carriers die in dread brawls you wouldn't make use of the spool up
---
Sorry what?
---
Forget the cap v cap capabilities, if these get haw guns they are going to be insane. 6k spooled subcap dps will absolutely wreck fleets
---
Sorry, poking fun at Brisc. Don't mind me.
---
Last time I ran the numbers on that, omega was more expensive. RobertBobbee should check out C3 day-tripping though. The isk is better, the challenge is probably better, and the risk is a little higher but still very manageable. Since it looks like the goal is to fly the 'snake, that's what I'd recommend.
---
Once a whale gets over the initial learning curve, it's not hard to see how more money = more strength. Whether that be cloaky camping alts to find you prime targets, or 20+ Rorqual alts to generate insane amounts of income.
---
But no, it won't necessarily make them better or stronger than the current power houses and catching up quickly isn't the problem either. My problem, personally is that the more real life money you spend is a huge factor in how much power you have in the game via alts, and it's one that's always existed and one I will always have a problem with and the reason why MMO's have been a dying breed, as the average player can't be asked to dump cash into a game like they're dumping coal into a steam engine. 
---
So instead of making mechanics that will allow the single subscriber to have half as much utility as the 5 account multiboxer, it's simply ignored and those players, who otherwise might  have been great players or skilled FC's leave the game, because it's clear you need 3-4 subscribed accounts to be at all relevant.
---
Yes, I know this has always existed in Eve, and is and always will be considered the norm, but that knowledge doesn't leave me any less frustrated as every MMO I have ever played has lead me to quit after I reach the paywall *spend 100's of dollar to get better gear, or exp boosts, or pets, or alternate accounts*

Heh, I googled...I'm not in the loop.

Do crystals and Asklepians affect remote reps?

I hate it when people try to call Eve p2w. Go ahead try it out lemme know how that goes.

been trying it for 14 years mate. PLEX is p2w. multiboxing is p2w. injectors are turbo p2w. wish i had my totally not p2w OG boosters back tho.

The League of Self Enriching Righteousness (LOSER)?

I agree with this! I love that they are exploring Aether!

I just hope they get evicted again it must suck being so hated in WH space that every once in awhile everyone that isn't Russian just up and decides to push your shit in

No

What I intended, but expressed wrongly was:

5 minutes * 20% = 1 minute

a.k.a. in common Eve math:

5 minutes * (1 - 80%) = 1 minute

I don't play every day. Daily Alpha Injectors cost 68M &amp; I operate at a loss since I don't grind 68M on the days I  do play. If I run 4 missions it's a lot. I was lucky &amp; found 5 Harvester Mining Drones my 2nd week playing. I've been spending the ISK I got from selling them &amp; I'm down to 2B in the bank &amp; 6M SP. I think this is a power play by CCP to get more cash flow. Only one Alpha account per computer can be logged in at a time so the "fleets" of botters in high sec is not as severe as it is with Omega accounts in null. They could address the courier missions with needing to enter a code in to be able to jump through a gate.
---
You need to click on the cogwheel after your account has been added and select the option to remember your account.
---
Drone flight and cycle time becomes really important with that many rorqs.
---
How do I get in on this?
---
Angel Cartel Caps first.. tia
---
So was TESTs incursion into Geminate. So was INITs incursion into Tribute. 
---
Turns out, its super fucking aids to hit an entrenched enemy that has supercapital superiority without deploying supercaps of your own, but nobody is willing to deploy their supercapitals because if they lose then they now have to start from absolute zero. Due to how ridiculous the rorqual output and industry slots are now, if you lose your force, you're exponentially worse off than prior to Citadel.
---
Pretty much, I think most of the people still left are the ones that would still play and say "EVE IS NOT DYING!!!" when there were like 14 people playing.
---
I run fleet abyss sites tier 3 dual boxing hawks. 
---
Making good isk and don’t see myself stopping anytime soon. It’s not quite super ratting isk but 200m an hour is nice. I lose the odd ship but the gains pay for it fairly fast. 
---
So I'm somewhat new to the game but have been making decent headway. Had a stratios with roughly 4.5k of shields and hull (each) with the standard structure values. Anyway I'm looking for some good points to scan and I jump into a 0.4 low-sec system. I notice some rather looking guys close by and go to move back through the gate but naturally this removes my cloak, straight away I'm suddenly being attacked and in a few seconds I'm dead, I couldn't even react. I have no idea what killed me, all I saw was a tractor beam looking thing and I have no Idea how I'm even meant to go about avoiding/countering that.
---
No.
---
Link fit. 
---
I wouldn't agree with most of this.
---
I played a warrior in Vanilla classic and having to eat after every mob was nothing i particulary enjoyed in retrospec.
---
The thing about Vanilla wow and early eve is, that it happened in my (and many others) childhood and was magical and i think a lot of people glorify it for that reason. 
---
I also dont believe that things like dungeons that require you to farm resistance gear or traveling to a dungeon entrance or the unhealthy pvp rank system from vanilla are things that make a game better. 
---
Raids became more accesible for the casual player over the course of wow expansions but is that really a bad thing? If you go back and compare the difficulty of vanilla raids with raids from the actual expension on highest difficulty, i think its quite obvious that the modern content is more demanding mechanically. A lot of players weren't used to the raid mechanic and the gating behind getting 40 players together for a raid or farming resistance gear kept a good portion of the playerbase outside of the raids.
---
Maybe im entirely wrong with my opinion but classic servers are opening up in the future and these points will be put to the test. I think that raid groups will be having very little trouble with the content, for one because the mechanics are already known and they are easier overall. 
---
Sure, everybody can do the actual wow content on a casual difficult level but thats no argument for the endgame getting easier over the course of expensions.
---
Eve on the other side has become alot more forgiving in many parts but if you compare classic wow with modern eve, there are still worlds between it. 
---
Focus on the weapon system and learn the in and outs of them and then chose what race you want to train for. 
---
I have T2 trained for all guns and missiles except for Gallente because i dislike the damage on Rails and the distance needed for Blasters. Minmatar has great Small and Large guns but the Medium need a buff IMO. Minmatar can do damage types but are especially good at THERM and EM. T2 ammo i believe in Explo and KIN.  
---
Amaar guns are very good in Small and Medium but in my experience take to much Cap in Large, They have very quick ammo switching but a very limited damage type. Em/Therm. 
---
if you don't want to bother with any of them just go with Caldari and rock all the Missiles. 
---
Since it's a "network-OS" it's most likely so they can gather information about latency/distance.
---
I understand where you’re coming from, and most of the vets seem to have similar issues too..
---
But in my case for example spending money on a game has its benefits and please hear me out first before any hate.
---
I’m busy most of the time and I don’t have the time to run multiple alts to farm isk for me or whatever, that’s why I buy some plex once in a while to fund my activities and pvp, since the only time I get to play is when I have free time and I just want to enjoy the game and have fun, I don’t need a second job.
---
That being said, I still can understand why people might be against how plex and injectors work, but not everybody abuses them.
---
Me personally I have only one alt, but I’m training that alt towards industry just so I can experience that aspect of the game, that’s about it..
---
Worm holes are death traps for Alphas. The inability to cloak means you are visible on D-scan constantly while having no idea if there is an Omega hunting you until they decloak on top of you. The talented players will scan down all the anomalies and use D-scan to zero in on you. You can keep hitting D-scan &amp; never see combat probes because they aren't there.
---
I mean, considering Korean gaming culture tends to be "milk whales with 32432804823048 microtransactions cuz that's actually accepted over there", its generally not a good thing.

It will be on Saturday, I'm spending the day putting a brand new system together. I've not had a desktop in more than 10 years, and I've not had a new laptop in around 7.
---
I'm looking forward to seeing what Eve looks like in better than potato graphics. 
---
I wish they'd do the opposite. Remove armor slaves from all capitals, and buff armor amounts to compensate. It's so boring when slaves are your only serious option for armor supers.
---
I'll be using the stock one that came with it, thanks for your help.

I mean, ANY game can be fun with friends.  When you have to use the argument "but yeah its fun with friends!" you know your game has issues.  Hello to the Anthem/Destiny 2 defense.

On my phone but go with HAMs and gank over tank. Mid should have adaptive, xlsb, web, battery, AB. Low are all faction BCS. Take db7 pyrolancea and have a blue pill on retainer. Use faction missiles and throwaway warriors, the faction missiles + web kills cruisers and below real fast. Warriors distract small shit too, you'll get gud at launching and recalling them.
---
Have 5% implants for damage and application. You *can* use mid-grade crystals but that just increases the cost for mininal gain, as you want your DPS to be your main tank.
---
The hardest wave to clear is the drifter battleship, make sure you clear webbers first, then neuters, and stay outside of 50km from the drifter, manually corkscrew into him after you kill the cruiser trash.
---
The CalAmarri coalition does not appreciate your squid jokes.

From my personal opinion....

Don't pay for anything. Especially from someone like Eve Mogul.

I think he screams of snake oil salesman. Do not spend IRL money. 
---
Hmm yeah seems to work.  Wonder why that checkbox on the login screen is b0rked...
---
So basically if you can't fight supers you might as well quit eve ?
---
Because there isn't a zone where you can roam where you won't end up having to run from supers at some point. 
---
Thog dont caare
---
no u

I think the Eve Mogul subscription is only paid for by isk.  The 3 options are free, 50 mil/month, 100 mil/month I believe.
---
Is that really a Moros to scale on a Leshak? Feck.
---
Why is that ship so expensive?
---
So most likely what happen to you was, you hit the gate.
---
Gate campers saw the gate flash or had a cloaked scout on the side you jumped from.
---
You de-cloaked and depending on the number of people it doesn't take much to burn a ship down.
---
You might have thought it was only a few seconds but once that happens and your heart rate jumps it could have been 20 seconds before you realized what was actually happening.
---
The tractor beam thing was most likely the target and tackle ship warp scramming you to shut you WMD down so you could burn to the gate or warp off.
---
2 Things you can do to try and avoid these things. 
---
First is use [Zkillboards](https://zkillboard.com/) before jumping into a system and check for recent pvp deaths.
---
Second is don't try and jump right away. If you see people take a deep breath and hold until your gate cloak is about to wear off. It is in hopes that someone else jumps in the system and gets their attention off you. Also when you go to jump spam your cloak and hit jump to something anything but never jump to the sun or another gate. This is for lowsec. Nullsec bubbles are another thing for another time.
---
Any questions just ask.
---
Don't dive into the jump range from the staging.
---
Don't go into the same place every time and there's a smaller chance for a boson at gate
---
o7 see you there

Just gonna say it's pretty sweet being able to form 30 carriers and fax to defend a fortizar against a 120 man gang. If used properly they let the little guy defend himself from blobs of idiots. In another sense haw dreads are a force multiplier for small alliances to use against shitty blobs as well. Go away with your shitty suggestions to encourage more blobs

Be simple, consistent, clear, and fair with your rules. Do not allow double standards/favoritism to creep in.
---
Simple: Don't create a huge ruleset, just say no drama, not scamming, or w/e you core values you want to espouse and then hold people to them.
---
Consistent: Do not allow double standards/favoritism to creep in. (well I really like so and so so i'll give him a pass on not participating in fleets).
---
Clear: Tell people exactly what they are doing wrong when they're fucking up, and exactly what they are doing right when they aren't. Try not let feelings or fear of conflict get in the way.
---
Fair: Make any rules and/or punishments fair. When I kick someone I want them to think themselves "I saw that coming".
---
Be active if you want to focus on PVP lead tons of fleets and do everything you can to become a good FC.
---
Delegate, find people you can trust and give him clear jobs and tasks to do for you. Learn to relinquish some control.
---
Short answer no.

Good write up

The thing that's driven me from the game (as I've decided I'm not resubbing this month) and from null is that fleets ultimately are a win-lose for me, and that F1 monkeying is popular because while the single account subscriber might be having fun on the fleet, he loses out on opportunity cost from not krabbing, where the multiboxer can be both on the PvP fleet, and have has his Rorqual alt in a VNI circling havens and have the Muninn or dictor paid off by the time the fleet is over, where as the single account subscriber gets nothing for his efforts besides \~fun\~.   
---
\~Elite\~ "solo" PvPers often multibox their own scouts/tackle so that they are able to mitigate the risk to their billion isk Orthrus or Barghest and only take the fights that will be a near enough sure kill.  
---
Mission Runners will place alts into fw space to afk plexes, while their main runs missions to collect the tags needed to convert FW LP profitably.  
---
Capital ships need a cyno alt to be used and many alliances REQUIRE cap pilots to have an additional FAX alt.   
---
\~Elite\~ War deccers will have an out of Corp alt to keep tabs on targets, etc. etc.  
---
The list goes on, not to mention the time efficiency being in the years by having dedicated toons.   
---
It's just a long list and money = power has always been a theme in MMO's. I  keep coming back because I'm always able to find a good community of duders, but I leave because I start taking the game a little serious and realize I don't have enough money in the bank to make those virtual dreams a reality.
---
Why are they so confused by what no new server means lol
---
you mean diversity doesn't work?

its not borked. It's the SSO login page you see which has nothing to do with remembering the account in the launcher.

Its not optimal but a minor issue if I were to be asked

Hit the gate? I've done WH space quite a few times and have always been successful in avoiding a fight bar one time when a group of 3 hunted me down and one guy got a pot-shot off on me before I got away, but this time I my ship had barely moved. what sort of armour/shield levels would even be good for being able to take hits like these because looking at some of the other ships in the store, their base values are lower than mine despite being dedicated fighters.

If i check the box at EVE Login screen, the login doesnt go through, it just blanks out the username/password fields.  This means it's "b0rked", in other words, a bug.
---
Yes they are worth it and way more fun than any ratting or mission I've ever done. There are lots of fits out there, mostly Gilas, active or passive tank depending on playstyle. I prefer active.

That's doable by making the weapons sig massive. Ie bs guns have a 400m sig so that's counted into the damage calculation well counted before resist is. Could make the guns have a massive sig size and a velocity component. 
---
&gt; I basically exclusively run Abyssals now
---
Great job CCP, now you've got people playing entirely outside the sandbox in a way that makes it almost impossible to interact with them!
---
So majority of DPS comes from the turrets according to the eveuni wiki, and that stuff is em/therm according the chruker, while the majority of alpha comes from missiles, and that stuff is kin/exp. 
---
Haw guns honestly need removed.
---
Encouraging small fleet warfare does not equal blobs. The fact that you are okay with capitals making up 1/4 of an enemy fleet and winning is why sub-caps are getting irrelevant. You are the exact reason people are leaving this game in droves. Thumbs down to your stupid philosophy. 
---
Capitals in general are to small carrier and dreads should be bigger but I'm guessing g engine limitations at the time required their models be smaller.
---
Where’s all my worm holers!?
---
I didn't even know this was a thing. Here we go: https://zkillboard.com/kill/75562878/
---
Made me instantly think of a "Look to Windward" as well.
---
what is exacly happening in Semiki  what location
---
&gt;Purely from a hypothetical perspective, if time dilation occurred, would that also impact the speed at which the light from B-R5RB traveled?
---
Do you mean the TiDi in game or the completely real phenomenon of TiDi?
---
I'm not sure of the "lore" explanation of in game TiDi but in real life TiDi only impacts the object traveling at extreme speeds so it would impact the observation of time from the light's perspective but not our observation of the time it takes for the light to reach UALX.  [Gravitational lensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens) might however impact it if there is a massive object in the way.
---
Everything you said makes a lot of sense, also honestly I can also see myself in the future having a problem with all the things that you mentioned as well.
---
Like I mentioned, I’m still a new player and I’m actually trying to make the best out of this game and have fun while I still can, also by trying not to take it too serious.
---
I feel like once you start playing a game competitively in a way, it turns into a stressful chore. I mean right now I just want to have fun and blow up things, I don’t care about my killboard, I don’t care how fat my isk wallet is, and I could care less who’s camping on the other side of the star gate, I love the feeling of danger and not knowing, so I don’t need a scout.
---
My point is, I actually TRY to make the game fun, I’ve been hanging out on reddit since i started playing so at least I have an idea of the negative things so I know what to ignore rather than let it ruin the game for me..
---
But I assume you have been playing for years and you’re past this newbie fun and experience, so I don’t blame you for how you feel..
---
Brisc, why is the corax, caracal navy issue and widow shit? Cant you lobby ccp to fix this instead of commissioning furry "art"  for you and your corp? When will you go to church to confess your sins?
---
&gt; If you want to whale in a zone secured by super capitals, better be able to fight them.
---
What do you mean by 'whale'? Because if you mean 'roam' what you're saying is that people shouldn't expect to be able to roam in 90% of Eve. That is clearly bad for the game.
---
TDSIN complaining about yachting lmao so ironic
---
Well I think its silly to take something I meant with a wink seriously. But yeah reading between the lines is hard thats why I used a winky smiley. Apparently thats still not enough for everyone :D
---
Well yeah mistakes were made. So what? Honestly it worked pretty well. With a bit more tackle and being ready 10-15min earlier we might've even saved the Fort. We don't think evictions kill WH space. BLTH will be a good example of this. We will continue to do evictions and probably someone will come for one of our homes again. Well bring it on. If I wanted to play in a Hello Kitty Safezone I wouldn't live in wormholes ;)

---
I saw this in a slack and thought it was a shitpost... I guess not?
---
The judge has gained weight didnt think that was possible
---
To be fair, there is interaction within Abyssal via the Proving grounds (if T3 &amp; above and choose to) as well as Abyssal traces are able to be probed down so you could track someone down, scan down their trace and gank them after they come back. Most people running these sites are very bling (2bn+ HACs) so it can be quite profitable.
---
Still more interaction than a cyno panic Rorqual :)
---

---
I hope bpc will be only from proving conduit
---
I generally agree with your second statement onward. I still think this would be a profitable exercise for you. Here's why: First, I think you overestimate how frequently you'll get "caught" daytripping into C3s. There is definitely some skill and content knowledge involved. If you daytrip from next door to Jita, for example, you're going to have a bad time because Wingspan watches those holes. If you daytrip into a wormhole that has 4 incoming wormholes connected to it, you multiply the odds that someone hostile will see you by quite a bit more than 4. I don't have hard numbers on this, but I'm pretty confident that (absent the things I've mentioned above), you would make enough profit over your current ISK-making pattern to pay to replace your ship before you lost it.
---
One downside is that the play pattern will be a little longer than you may be used to. I'm guessing right now you can play for 5 minutes if you feel like it. Get a mission, undock, run the mission, dock, log. With daytripping, it's more like (1) undock the scanning frigate and find a good hole (\~15 minutes, but will reduce as you get better at it), (2) swap to your Rattle and get in position (a minute or two), (3) run a site (I run C5 sites in a pair of Nestors, which takes me 20-30 minutes. I think C3 sites are a little shorter, so call it \~15 minutes), (4) extract your loot (5 minutes to find a good NPC buy order nearby). Obviously you can repeat step 3 a bunch of you have extra time, and that's where the profit will really take off. All told, we're looking at going from minimum effective play time of 5 minutes to one of \~35 minutes. If that's not viable for you, I have other ideas.
---
Eve time is UTC, which is what Iceland uses year round.
---
everyone in this guild is offline. Its keeping me entertained while i read up on stuff. also set a short term goal of grinding out +3 int/wis implants.
---
there is already a vertical cap, but yes, the angel dread will be vert too, if it's ever released.
---
Not even close, the virtuoso has a serpentis web, which on an AT ship should mean not less then 95% with a 15+km cold range. Add in the fact that a victor should top 1k dps before implants and drugs and the astero loses the fight quite quickly. Even against the tiny sig the astero has it should be applying about 260 dps before implants and drugs.
---
Even if. It's not possible to kill a supercap fleet before downtime hits or you degress/boson the bubbles. DD cycles something like 30 mins, the most the absolute most you will lose is like 30 titans.
---
That's how bad proliferation is. It would take several "impossible fights" to know down the blob far enough to "start from zero"
---
The Cyno is lit
---
How well do neuts/remote reppers draw aggro from sleepers?
---
Inner Hell using the eviction of a small PVE group as a casus belli? Big lols for that.
---
Haha, I had forgotten about this somehow. Thanks for the reminder.
---
The idea that eve is not p2w often depends on the argument that you could still lose even if you have an advantage and while that's correct that doesn't excuse p2w because p2w isn't about the paying player winning 100% of the time it's about the developer selling power and CCP has very much done this as you can turn Money in to SP and isk. 
---
&gt;Hi guys I've just returned to eve and am trying to find something interesting to make pvp money. I've been running tier 1 and 2 sites no problem using my old belt ratting gila. About to move up to tier 3 and am wondering if  
---
&gt;The rewards increase enough to warrant the added risk of tier 4and5  
---
&gt;Are the extraction nodes worth going out of your way for. Thanks
---
The real ISK is made in T5 Fire and Dark filaments. If all you do is run exotic / gamma, then your total income will be diminished around 25-50 % depending on filament type drop RNG. Gila, especially the passive one, is a bad choice for anything other then the exotic and gamma. The active Gilas can do electrical and Fire, with the emphasis on fire being tough. They can not do Dark T5s. In dark T5s you may get a lucky spawn streak and then blammo guaranteed.
---
The drill sites are up to you. What I usually do is set myself a time limit to do sites. 15 minutes per site. So if I do a room in less then 5 minutes, and have enough time to get to a drill site and hit the gate, then I do just that. The RNG here is on drill site spawn locations. Sometimes I end up fighting and killing last NPCs near a drill site, I will go get the site. But I do not go out of my way to specifically go for all the sites. Also I usually run them 4 at a time, in 1 hour blocks. So time permitting, on the very last room of the last site, I will go get all the drill sites unless it puts me against the 20 min timer. So to answer your question "are drill sites worth it?" My answer is maybe, because its RNG dependant on both actual drill site spawn location as well as entire site, if I get 3 rooms with nothing but drifter or drone battleships that take a long while to chew through, then I can't go for any drill sites cause I'll hit the 20 min timer.
---
If you intend to get into higher Abyss then I very highly recommend you look up some fits, do a bit of research, and don't fall for the passive Gila trap cause you'll be making less ISK due to limitations on filament types it can comfortably use.
---
lol... all that will happen with that is people will take caracaels into level 3 dark sites 
---
Doesnt happen for me (Windows 10)
---
It logs in the account just fine, no matter if i check the remember me box or not.
---
Might be an issue on your end but you might want to submit a bug report.
---
You can do so at https://bugs.eveonline.com and you might want to add your launcher [logfiles](https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/202664145). 
---
oh wow um few things to note here. first if you intent  to do data and relic sites use an astero. strats are fat and slow and no good for that. they are best at cloaky hunting . dont use a strat if you cant fly covert ops cloak. dont dual tank any ship its either shields or armor but never both. most of the time you want to tank a strat with armor. damage control, energized adaptive nano membranes, and either an armor rep or a plate. always use all of your slots rigs included. if it dosent fit then you need to rethink it.
---
Definitely a bug here, no idea why.  I will report, thanks.
---
I agree and thanks for the input it will help me improve. 
---
When Dura Lexx gives you shit. +1
---
10 out of 10 on that spelling tho......
---
Lots of people live in villages with internet. And since there's less RL hobbies available every night in them, there's probably a disproportionate number in online games.
---
light travels the same speed no mater where the observation is happening or what speed they are traveling. Time is  not constant but the speed of light is.
---
You can't interact with them in the PVP room if they don't choose to go in there.
---
And you can combat scan them down but you'll get Concorded if you try to gank them, since CCP still haven't put suspect status back onto T4-5. You can run them in Perimeter on a trade hub grid. So they are as safe as anyone in Eve who ever undocks could possibly be.
---
I have this issue also for 2 years...

The Cyno is lit.

It would be interesting to find out

&gt;First is use Zkillboards before jumping into a system and check for recent pvp deaths.

A slightly more sophisticated version is this:  [http://eve-gatecheck.space/eve/](http://eve-gatecheck.space/eve/)
---
That'll show a whole route for you.

I had no indication that 1 particular song would be blocked out in other countries due to copy rights. When I get off work today I'll go re-edit the video to change that song out and republish a new link for all the non-Americans to enjoy as well. Sorry about that!
---
Holy shit man. Marshy camped GoTG for so much longer than he has camped Goons. Even those babies cried less about him than you are.
---
Read the stickies and don’t make stupid cute newbie karma whoring posts on Reddit. Why is there a new one of these EVERY FUCKING DAY!?
---
A fresh server would be really cool but you would have to axe injectors and plex 
---
Sadly thats the song that got it blocked in most countries, apparently it's too rad and had to be censored :(   
---
I'll be reuploading a new video with that song subbed out when I get home from work today so everyone else can watch.
---
No coward. I hack the cans in those in a covops. You just gave to kite the rats away first, like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmxbQ8LTQgU Though it won't work if there are battleships or sentries. And only worth doing n if there are abandoned talocan ships. http://i.imgur.com/OmV5zrz.jpg
---
Is there a way to set the default tab for Show Info results on another player? 
---
I want the damn thing to open on Employment History every time but it just jumps around because it remembers the index of the tab and not the name of it, so with some people having a Bio tab and others not, the history of the index is pretty useless.
---
WTB tab\_history\[last\_name\] not tab\_history\[last\_tab\_index\]
---
I'll be fixing that tonight and re-uploading around 20:00 CST
---
It doesn't work for me.
---
Spreadsheets are your friend.
---
You only need 2,000 if everybody brings their 5 Alts. 
---
I know its difficult guys, but just stick with me here
---
&gt;reams of snake oil s
---
They are. In fact, it has to be for isk because it is a EULA (as well as copyright) violation to actually sell anything related to EVE for money, be that spreadsheets, isk, plex, or third party web applications. 
---
Keeping up goals is very important imo. Keep it up :) (Also feel free to hit me up with dms here if you have any more question) 
---
It’ll be eve ship skins and that’s about it. It’s mass test using the same game engine in the demo video. I wouldn’t expect too much. 
---
Nothing beats Zendane's voice though...
---
Hey to Magnate is to be a pain in the ass to catch. Don't worry about the gun. If you get held down, you're dead.. addind warp core stabs in the lows will make you hard to lock down. Only Sabres and fairly dedicated hunters will have a counter for that. Anything else you'll be slippery AF.
---
Drawback is the stabs will slow down your lock speed a lot.
---
when I did the youtube shit, I used to upload an unlisted black screen tester video with just the songs - takes like 5m and lets you see if it's gonna be clear later
---
You sir are a hero. Much bigger balls then me! 
---
Remove jump bridges. Remove jumping. Reduce all ships to 1 AU/s warp speed and max 200 meters a second. Just make it brawl online.
---
I would love more investment into the EvE sandbox than this Abyss crap.
---
&gt; How actively/intensely does one generally have to play before being able to afford PLEX  
---
Actively and Intensely enough that a ton of people end up quitting the game because of it. This is a very and extremely wrong way to approach Eve Online unless you are literally unemployed and not in school, for example, retired, then it may be OK, and that's a big maybe because even then it drives people nuts.
---
Also, plex prices are going to continue rising, they will never be coming back down. Maybe some small market dips here and there, but overall they will be just going up and up. Reason for this is that the current multiboxers are making more and more accounts, thus using up more plex, while more and more players that supply the plex such as single account holders are quitting the game. Thus supply is diminishing.
---
So by the time you finally train into a super, etc. This whole playstyle may be dead, or plex may be like 10 bil / 500 or alike. Do keep that in mind.
---
yeah i've found that putting any song less than a year old and released by a major label is a great way to get your video blocked
---
Oh sweet I didn't even know about that. Thank you.
---
If they're run in high sec you'll get concorded - yeah. Grab 2 tornado alts and gank them like you would anyone else in high sec. They don't know what's waiting for them when they come back from the abyssal site. If you look at the killboards there is a lot of people getting ganked in their bling HACs. 
---
T2 ABC please! We have t2 combat BCs as command ships 
---
Only if you're going to apply a Nanite Thermal paste. Otherwise it's just plug'n'play
---
Elo repeats himself often because many people white knuckle and do the wrong things in the heat of a fight (shooting wrong things, shooting wrong ammo, deanchoring, etc). Time is of the essence, and Elo is one of the best, if not THE best, at analyzing situations quickly and making the right calls to win fights that would otherwise be unwinnable for lesser FC's and fleets. He takes some getting used to, but when you go from an Elo fc'd fleet to someone else's, the differences are often obvious. 
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Ohh trust me I will thanks for the tips

---
T4 abyss sites pull 100 mill an hour but you need pretty damn good skills to them.
---
100 mill an hour is the peek of what most players are gonna get, so looking at least 20 hours a month. Probably more 
---
&gt; stress test for the Aether Engine to see if it can match or break CCPs record of 6,142 players in a single instance.
---
Given this will have significantly less calculations per second to do, if people show up it's absolutely possible to break this record. 
---
&gt;Only one Alpha account per computer can be logged in at a time
---
It is true, unfortunately VMs. Sorry it had to come down to this, I also wish CCP would find a different solution. But the bot plague has to be dealt with. The Rorq, Supers and VNI bots the most as IMHO these are the ones doing by far the most damage to the game.
---
Ya, it really sucks having to pay a crew a wage leaving slaves as your only economical option.
---
A good move would be running all your assets through evepraisal. I periodically leave for a few years at a time and on every return there has been one or two bits of trash that have bizarrely become quite valuable. 
---
I often wondered if it would have been a lot more balanced to have rorquals with no panic module, but excavators only be like 50m each.
---
Ummm.... Meta 4 are T1 ..... just the higehr end of it. And you get them mainly via drops in L4s.
---
The great part is, there's no ore so you can't even panic.
---
right? Right?! QQ
---
Haha!
---
Burn!

When your BR is carried by a JF kill :thinking:

You really think people are gonna cry at t1/meta modules.

They were fine before alpha.

Included in this art are all kinds of subliminal messages designed to get them to fix the Corax, CNI and Widow. If you look long enough you will be able to see them.

---
That falcon, couldn't be a more eve like lossmail.
---
I figured that was what you meant, but I had to ask to be sure. You never know these days lol.
---
How about instead of creating new high end stuff that only the most grindy players or players who know how to game the system will experience, instead make a better tutorial.
---
I've long been on the sidelines of this game because my one forray into the game ended with getting podded again and again because I had ventured into lowsec whilst taking the ongest safest route and then wandered off because it was taking forever to get places.
---
A new player gets taught the controls of the game through a very short and poorly designed tutorial, and then gets dropped off in the deep. Go find a corp.
---
When I just start a game I'm not quite sure if I feel ready for the commitment of joining a corp, I'm still busy getting oriented.
---
If new players had a path to take that was provided by an extended single-player questline, teaching the basics, showing what paths a player can take with escalating challenges in highsec, and which if followed provide rewards based on player choice so that a new player going through the effort can start their forray into lowsec with some resources, a decent ship based on their choices of playstyle and some resources to set out with. As well as a basic understanding of the game.
---
After that new player experience will improve and joining another corp would not feel like a barrier to entry.
---
If CCP were to spend some dev time on this, I imagine I might actually pick this game up.
---

So when is init evicting inner hell for being a scourge to wormhole space? 
---
I mean it's not much different than the thousands of hisec mission runners that have existed for 10 years. Only difference is how you gank them.
---
Ran a few dozen. Spent 1 Bill on a Muninn. Entered site, gate was open literally within 45 seconds. Game glitched out, had no control over direction. Game pushed me to the arena boundary. Died. Put in ticket, they rejected it. I'll never touch a fucking abyssal again.

It's 15% if you move your assets to another system. It's only 0.5% if you move your assets to another station in the same system.

what? thought they were machetted in TVN-FM
---
On one hand, guaranteed fireworks if you drop 100 bombers or a dozen dreads on a mining fleet.  on the other hand, less ability for cloaky solo harassment of miners.
---
Would you rather have it be out in the game space where they can just warp off the instant a neut appears in local and safe up in a pos/citadel?
---
Unlike people running DED sites or combat anomalies, at least you know where they are, will come out of, and can wait to gank them.

That's pretty bad too. I've always argued for more risk for nullsec anomaly runners too. But at least there are things you can try to do to catch them.

It's a fully indoctrinated goon. The health of the game matters infinitely less to them than the health of GSF and the safety of Delve. I'm not even shitting on the guy, I can see the logic in it, it's just how they all think and you will never convince them otherwise.
---
Isn't that what the like 50 missions in starting spaces are for? Unfortunately, nothing is going to prepare a new player for getting blown up except blowing up and finding/having a group of people to ask questions. That's literally basic common sense.
---
Also not the point of this thread.

I find Gilas only good in Gamma Rays. Cerbs excel in Darks and Sacs are great for Electrical and Exotic. I have yet to find a decent T5 Firestorm fit that doesn't pucker my butthole and costs less than 1.2b

Not really, as you will need to re cycle for each target.

They might be interacting less trough in a regular player-player interaction but abyssal runners interact a LOT trough the market.
---
Every time they lose a ship to abyssal rats, thats a 100% module sink. Not that they wouldn't have lost stuff while doing regular EVE stuff but, thats only a 50% due to fairy.
---
Still, not like EVE is harmed by more content for people that could for example just log off.

&gt; Still, not like EVE is harmed by more content for people that could for example just log off.
---
But it *is* harmed if people are split up into separate silos within the game.
---
Yes, they interact through the market, which is good, but is that really the PVP that makes Eve interesting?
---
As you said, it doesn't address the real botting problem. This is an attempt to get more paying customers. CCP is fine with the botting in null as long as people aren't blatant about it. The pay for Omega.

5v1 and barely pulled out the win, how did the mighty fall so far?

But how did they get back to hig without a lowsec gate to-

Also, the argument that groups of people are fighting in EVE being a bad thing is fucking hilarious.

Here, have an original.

Also I didnt even notice the dickbutt was even there for ages. https://imgur.com/a/XgCyqBS

This is exactly on point. Just to piggy back on this as well. The reason your life didn't have time to flash before your eyes is you had 3 tornados alpha you into dust. Tornados are Battlecruisers that can fit Battleship size weapons. Those guns fire very very slow however the per shot damage is damn near the highest in the game.

(Take these with a grain of salt)

If you wanna build combat then build combat, if you wanna explore then build for that.

Never mix tanks if you can avoid it.

Avoid having empty slots.

Nice "argument" you have there proving your point (which is?), I think its called an ad hominem. In other words you went "you a poopoo". I thought there was a 13 year rating on Eve. 
---
i am up for a wide ship rather then long ship 
---
&gt; a percentage of the cost.
---
15%. And you don't have to buy it all back at once (or even buy all of it back). You can pick and choose at your leisure.
---
They just released some video tutorials on how to do various things in eve lmao
---
Are people on this here spaceship mmo subreddit really making fun of how much other people weigh? 
---
It would buy more time before the escalation hit, as long as the tackled guy doesn't have a cyno ceptor in system ready to go.
---
I can churn my current 70bn liquid isk through reactions-&gt;t2 manufacturing-&gt;trade-&gt;ore-&gt;reactions-&gt;t2 manufacturing-&gt;etc a few more times (get roughly 35% profit every cycle) and get there for my third titan. The beauty of the delve model, all hail Aryth. 
---
IMHO I think exploration as a newbro is one of the most profitable and enjoyable forms of income.
---
To be frank however, I think you're making a mistake in doing sites in Jspace, rather then just using Jspace as a corridor into nullsec.
---
Nullsec sites have no rats, have local, and if you hit a dead off timezone pocket (say russian space during USTZ) there can be dozens of sites that are available to be picked through at your leisure.
---
I would scan a way from highsec to nullsec and then farm and make the trip back. 
---
I think anyone that isn’t aware that cap proliferation is crazy outta control needs meds. 
---
Btw, that’s what I love about goons, you really should shave your neck, go out and do something with your life. 
---
Would you rather I didn't play at all? I'm back after 7 years exclusively because this type of content supports my current lifestyle (I now am married and have kids) and 20 minute sessions help that a lot. The result is 4 more subscribed accounts, as I resubbed my alt and got my 2 old friends back into it to.
---
Since I've been back, I've also been dabbling in exploration again, engaging with the market, paying for courier services to move my stuff around, and am planning on checking on nullsec this weekend. I also lose a lot of ships in the Abyssal PVP arena, which other players like to interact with as well.
---
To call it outside of the sandbox is naive.
---
Amarr Succession Trials. It's an AST Ship!

This would be a good thing.

He is my hero.

Capital Proving Conduit when?

Well, putting them in low isn't terrible. No lowsec market would ever compete with the big highsec ones
---
Leventy billion isk. 
---
Well, there go all your casual players.
---
It is perfectly reasonable to make it so a HIC can cyno jam \*or\* tackle/bubble. Then you at least require 2 HICs on field.
---
This is mesmerizing.

So it'd be straight from the noob tutorial to membership of goons?

I live there.

They mean major city. They even give examples like New York, Paris, etc. You may live in a town but the closest "city" could be Kyoto or Charlotte or Perth.

Do you have a gila fit for T3?

anything  related to triglavian/drifter spotted so far?

i was being a bit disingenuous. 1600 eve time is just before i knock off work, i'm a euro.
---
I'll still be in the office but yeah, mid morning for americans, late afternoon for euros... so when most of the playerbase is at work if they are working standard office hours - which i guess most of us do.
---
the turnout for this will be somewhere between piss poor, and lackluster i guess. not from lack of interest, just from seemingly poor planning.
---
Wasn't Sergal Jerk from TAPI a massive furry Corp, or was that someone else?  Either way, we need a bigger flamethrower.

Oh, coalition. Yeah that's whatever, I'm talking about Init specifically.

Valkyrie was a tech demo that got developed into a game due to the response. 
---
Wtf acabo de ver por la CTM????
---
Man, I’d LOVE to see something along those lines - though the format would have to be different in order to have it not be a boring pew pew and slowboat over and over with them, maybe add some things like the Sleeper Caches use
---
it's honestly not that dissimilar to DED runners. i personally think the silo aspect is not really a problem with them, i just think they should feature more geographic risk/limitations. 
---
Let's just ignore that half of the player base is in the alliance that gets voted in the most.

Very much worth it!! Good money, engaging PvE, chances at getting some really good drops. T3s are perfect because they’re doable in cheap fits, have stable income, and you could get some crazy pay days out of nowhere. I got 2 specialized skill books back to back running T3s worth 400m each one time! 
---
because the average player can't afford to whelp them.  The majority of players probably have less than 200M in their wallets.  
---
longer then HK
---
You said it yourself: PVP Corps, not chill guys who do PVE content most of the time.
---
It takes a very short amount of time to online cyno inhibs. Sorry that you don't understand how they work.

Because it's cheap.

Haven't been out that way in 5-6 years

Maybe I'll hop in a Rifter and make the journey just for this &lt;3
---
Two questions;
---
1. Will it playback in TiDi?
---
2. How the fuck do I get a telescope in EVE?
---
Wtf are you even trying to say? hahaha, It looks like you started with one idea and then finished with another.
---
Only, they aren't.
---
Hehe, well thought of
---
you lot are fucking insane and the reason why microtransactions exist
---
Check out the in game channel “Abyssal Lurkers” there are a bunch of fits in that channel and people who are fitting wizards/abyssal runners 
---
Sorry, I neglected to take all the other bonuses into account.  Yeah I’m not sure how I made my conclusion, but thanks for the clarification.
---
Now that's a fit.
---
I may have to get someone to build me an excel then.  Im surprised there isn’t an app or program people are using for this.
---
Can someone explain to me exactly what the point of it is? It sounds like "oh hey, we're creating another Eve server, but its still populating Tranquility so it won't affect current player count negatively." So what exactly is it doing then? Reducing ping?
---
Fixing overpopulation of rorqs
---
Here are a few reasons I can think of right now: 1) T1 fleets are cheap for alliances, especially the big ones; 2) other alliances offer this service so not offering it would mean being less competitive in attracting/retaining members; 3) stratops can be mandatory in some alliances and SRPs help fleet discontent (also makes it more likely members will show up since it's free, like minerals you mine yourself) ; 4) if FC makes a mistake or statop goes wrong, it reduces the likelihood of toxicity (again, because it's free) ; 5) since members must keep their hangars stocked with doctrines that money will likely go straight into replacing the lost hull - most likely bought from the local market which was seeded by Corp members (or even built locally).in others words in benefits the local economy and make non - pvp activities worthwhile (and brings money to the Corp though taxes).
---
To summarize, it costs close to nothing and has huge benefits. Having 40m in your Corp wallet won't win you the war. Having an extra F1 monkey in a 40m hull might.
---
Tapi defacto leader was in the biggest furry corp in the game? You were blue to them for multiple months? Etc. 
---
" If Init is making furry art I will actually leave this alliance "
---
Yes and no remember haw guns are capital guns. I mean guns that can only realistically hit super carrier and titan sized ships even normal caps should be to small to hit for shit.
---
People said the same about the Leshak when it was first announced and yet it is still inanely popular
---
WECU, edgelord nazi furries. 
---
lolwut  
---
I'm on their discord and fly with Traf pretty regularly.. this is news to me.
---
It's a way to distribute money from the worthless crabs to the people who show up on fleets.
---
I very much doubt there exists a Teessider who plays eve except myself.
---
&gt; no - TIDI eve would be frankly revolutionary
---
I mean, you're not wrong, but do you think it's actually possible to FC a fight like that in real time?  We're talking each involved party having several full fleets all with sub-FCs and high command...  I don't see how you could actually manage all that if it didn't slow down.
---
Don't even try it, don't you *dare* try it
---
If people didn't like Hitler they shouldn't have voted for him.
---
Amen brother
---
you ever tried to hit a battleship with cap guns (non HAW)?
---
I've just come back from a break and why the fuck are feroxes the new meta ship?
---
A Haw dread does significantly more DPS than a battleship, trig or not. You will be killing ships too quickly for it fully ramp up.
---
I’m going to try to make this one! 
---
We just announced that we are going to nerf all of the capitals and PVE vessels you've trained years for, so come help us test something....
---
tracking / damps on haw dreads really fuck them up, haws are not the issue, it is 
---
1. a small bit of people not adapting cos everyone smart left eve years ago
---
2. caps being moved around and dropped on nerds with cynos with such efficiency and ability
---
like me killing relikers in stain using caedes?heheee waiting for ya von brockhorst or whatever is ur name
---
The only bad thing that I see coming from this is that TDSN and Pospy are now the number 1 and 2 Corp in wh space. With hk now gone neither of them are going to be able to copy/paste ship fits and actually start using those ridges in their brains causing a massive explosion in the space time continuum. How the smooth brains at turbohawks and No Brains allowed them to amass that much power is a whole other story in it self. I stake my reputation on this you will see a combined fleet of the two largest corps in wh history finally undock and use capitals correctly then it will be over for the last bastions of good fights in c5 space. I will leave you all with that and I pray to our lord and savior that the garbage can coalition never graces your wormhole in the future.
---
yeah i wonder why the fuck around rpsi  see new asteros this days?want a caedes maybe:))))
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/aybw1a/come_and_say_goodbye_and_honor_my_corpmate/
---
The other replies are spot on. If all you’re looking to do is explore/relic/data sites I’d strongly recommend the astero over the stratios. If you’re doing it right, you never have to fight. Make sure you’re fitting a covert ops cloak and mwd.  Make it a habit to always be cloaked. I’ll say it again, ALWAYS BE CLOAKED.  As soon as you hit warp to, the cloak should be the very next thing you hit. Every single time. 
---
As far as surviving a gate camp goes, you’ll survive more in an astero as it’s more agile and faster. When you land in a camp you have a few seconds to decide what’s the best course of action.  Things I consider is, what ships and how many? What direction is my ship facing while gate cloaked? Am I in a bubble? Is there an interdictor waiting to launch a bubble?  
---
Based on the answers I either crash gate or try to run. If gate crash, just approach gate and pulse mwd, then jump. If running, align away from the enemies, pulse mwd for 1 second and then immediately turn on your cloak. Warp as soon as you clear bubble if there is one.  Getting cloaked is not enough, a good interceptor pilot will decloak and scramble you. You have to warp away ASAP. 
---
I’d also get some fast, cheap t1 frigs, go find some gate camps and just jump into them and try to live. You’ll probably die a lot at first, but eventually you’ll be able to get in and out of the camps with ease.  Once you’re good at it, you can fly pretty much anywhere in Eve with impunity.  Nullsec sansha space is where you want to go to run relic sites. 
---
Love the vanity plate
---
You should fly your caedes more often :) I here this is a good week to do so! We can go roam, your caedes and my imp :)
---
I'd be surprised if the EVE playerbase is the *only* place they're looking for participants. If you look at their discord, people were already on it when the tech demo was called just "Aether Wars", and they might get GDC attendees in it, they might hire some playtesters, etc.

Paid for accounts have access to more advanced ships and the biggest class of ships that pew pew while also having more access to more advanced mining ships and more industry stuff. 
---
goons have wives? or homes?
---
That’s gonna look so cool
---
You can download it and start playing for free, no need at all to pay to play from the very start unless you know what you are doing (as in, are making a new account as an older player etc)
---
At a certain point, you will find that you cant fly some of the bigger ships, or guns, or maybe cant make as many market orders as you would like, or etc etc etc, and to unlock all this, you will need to "plex" your account, either by paying IRL money and upgrading to an omega account, or by buying "plex" in game with in game money and upgrading to an omega account that way.
---
Once you are omega, your skills train twice as fast, and everything is unlocked for you to train into.
---
so how many kids you got with your sister?
---
Best relics in game are in Test space. Either be cloaky and paranoid or join Test and explore away. 
---
Long range, ok dps, cheap, easy to get noobs into.
---
And you're an idiot to assume simple cosmetic colour schemes for ships have any impact with gameplay except for "nice skin" in local.
---
Being an alpha clone (free) is like getting a high school diploma/GED.  It's nice and allows you to do a lot of things but after a while it might leave you wanting more (Alpha clones don't have access to certain skills in the game).  In addition, having only a High School Diploma/GED might set you behind in certain careers and not allow you to advance as quickly as others (As an alpha clone you do not gain skill points as fast as omega clones).
---
Being an omega clone is like graduating from a prestigious private university.  The world is your oyster and you have everything available to you (all skills are available for omega clones to inject).  In addition having that nice degree from that prestigious school will allow you to advance more quickly in you're career (as an omega clone you acre skill points faster than alpha clones).  
---
As an alpha clone you can do an absolute ton especially as a new player.  As you progress further in the game though it might leave you wanting more.  At that stage you should upgrade to omega.

Removing panic would remove any chance of defense. I can't think of how, but you would need to find another way to elongate the shenanigans if you did this.

perhaps instead of panic you get an "excavators &amp; exhumers have teeth" command burst module.
---
Since trig ships have been used often as a cap killing gangs thanks to their weapons, maybe trig caps will finally be the answer to killing rorqs and supers?
---
weight shaming someone IRL because you don't like them in a game is such a trashy thing to do.
---
you make me think that zkillboard is literally the eve pvp endgame.  
---
i'm not sure if that is amazing or terrible
---
So basically its corm fleets but scaled up.
---
Great.

Kill the rorq menace, one spool up at a time

Implying it'll have HAW guns to begin with

Huh? Where does 5v1 come from, on a BR showing 3v2?

Ya know what test was missing. Moral drake. Worked for PH

If everyone smart left years ago, and you still play, did you admit you're a moron?

wow that kinda hit me hard espically since i kinda wana a high school diploma and stop my education FOR THE FREE CLONE IT IS
---
"hold on, gotta reload my flight of sabres"
---
what are the chances of a f2p kicking ass tho?
---
Because you misunderstand the average player.  There are 2 categories of EvE players these days.  The so called 'bitter vets' who usually have somewhere around 100m+ SP and 20bn+ ISK.
---
Then you have the newer crowd, some are rich because they are older, some are quite poor and even run alpha only.
---
Decent if they know what they're doing
---
please tell me size dosent matter in all meanings
---
I would argue that the fact that TIDI allows a single FC to run the entire fleet is a contributor to the megablob-centric gameplay meta we currently have.
---
If real-time fights are big enough that the FCs are forced to delegate, we may start seeing more nuance in fleet composition - multiple attack groups with multiple objectives and their own support wings rather than capblob + subcapblob + logiblob at every fight.
---
If big fleets get too big to manage in real-time, we might see total fleet sizes shrink while doctrine diversity increases.
---
size doesn’t matter in EVE. It’s all nearly about skill. But size can help in a lot of areas. 
---
and how many weeks till i know what im doing?
---
I'd imagine it would become more like a real battle with smaller commanders running squads doing work, with larger Big picture battle space commanders.
---
A genuine fleet commander or admiral would be a totally unique skill compared with a squad commander.could be sick as fuck.
---
And by posting here he got the attention he's craving

How is NPC null for soloing with 3alts, all capable pilots? Also, where to live in NPC null?

Which is basically Eve Online

This, unironically, is largely true.
---
1am local time lol
---
I expect to see this in every WH thread btw 
---
You sound like a salty bitch
---
i mean the op is asking how to be a trillionaire, he isn't asking how to have fun at the start of eve and if he was having fun he wouldn't be making this thread. If his question would be how to have fun in eve and i absolutely had to answer i would tell him to quit because imo ccp has turned this game more into "how to be a trillionare" and away from "how to have fun"
---
there is nothing wrong with making your first trill via grinding, it's very feasible if you are looking at eve over years but if you want to go further then yes traditional grinding is gonna be pretty terrible. 
---
I also think it's a bit disingenuous to imply that the people who are making trillions via trading,industry or other similar means are not grinding. They still grinding, they just grind at 10b hour or 20b hour instead of 1b hour like the rorq/wh peasants. though tbh everyone i know in eve that has/had a trillion+ spent way too much time on eve no matter how they got their isk 
---
This is more to do with refinery location relative to warpin point.

Looks pretty good, a bit annoying to have to switch to potato half the time if your in NS tho :(

In late 2019 CCP Games announces a new game, Eve Aether Wars. 
---
“Based on the tremendous success of our beta tests and concept discussions we’ve responded to the overwhelming request from fans to put this out there. Whilst it shares a name with Eve Online and will share some artwork and models, Eve Aether Wars has no connection to Eve Online, and it’s release will have no impact on Eve Online’.
---
In early 2020 the free-to-play battle royale spaceship game Eve Aether Wars launches to great fanfare, with players embracing the fast paced combat and accessibility of the concept. Development is led out of CCP’s new Korean studio, leaving Iceland free to concentrate on Eve Online. 
---
In mid-2020 CCP games announce a consolidation of positions across their studios. “With the common elements across both Eve Online and Eve Aether Wars it makes sense to optimise our development resources, with art, modelling and design being run out of our Korean studio. Customer service, finance and other support departments will also be consolidated over time, giving customers of both games a more satisfying experience. 
---
At Fanfest 2020 CCP Games announces a change in expansion philosophy, moving to a more frequent, smaller release schedule.  ‘By releasing smaller changes as they’re ready we can keep players engaged and satisfied more easily’. 
---
In early 2021 CCP Games announces that Eve Online will receive no further updates, as the studio concentrates on their free to play Eve Aether Wars, whose release on mobile devices in late 2020 saw it continue to pull in strong profits from players. 
---
In late 2021 players participate in the final battle, massing in Jita until the game crashes for the last time. 
---
Around the world the dozen remaining players get up from their desks, walk outside and scream as their skin begins to burn. 
---
Somewhere a Goon Leader violates his parole for the third time, and is silenced. 
---
works fine with vindi webs
---
Realistically, the average player in the cheap fleets needs the isk more than the average player in an expensive one, and it's cheap as fuck to do on an alliance level, so why not?
---
You're taking aside the fact that larger null sec entities have the greatest ability to campaign to a large number of players, directly, while anyone not affiliated is going to have a much harder time of even finding an audience. 
---
same but with your posts
---
Alpha clones are the food you get from your high school cafeteria - it's cheap, there's some of everything, and the food is decent but you have to stand in line and they only have honey mustard for the chicken fingers.
---
Omega clones are a proper restaurant - more choices, faster service, and the full range of dipping sauce, but you need to pay the premium price for it.
---
I just checked out the killboard and this one is pretty typical. Do T3 Gammas while you learn the flow and enemy types, and ignore Dark! Dark messes with your drones too much, which is really bad and you might not complete it. Everything else should be okay though.
---
The dangerous rooms for you are the ones with the battleships. There's a drone battleship (named like Bathyic Abyssal something) that you really want to get under the guns of. Same with the Karybdis battleship. Just approach fast and get under the guns with a tight orbit and you'll be okay.

Not taking anything aside. What I responded was categorically false.

If you don't vote for 10 candidates for the CSM, then you are a part of the problem and should not complain that GSF is overrepresented.
---
They eat him?
---
I'd rate that a solid 5/7
---
Also, I would say that it's good for "morale" or whatever. People like to hear that a fleet is SRP'd, even if losing the ship only actually costs  them like 20m.
---
Oh My sweet sweet summer child.

Thats a great thing. I can farm caracals, caracal hunters and bpcs then )
---
First i love how you are still doubling down on this bad strategy... you stick the landings on..
---
Secondly you’re bringing in a whole range of interpretation of your own and projecting them onto my response .. I never said they use twitter etc? I cited them as examples of how 100,000,000s of clients are able to push network packets to a server without issues... and then I also cited that their current on prem hybrid approach isn’t optimal given the need..
---
That’s pretty much the point .. you’ve come in over the top bitching about data lakes, aws cloud solutions and the rest I’ll be honest I didn’t spend time parsing ... as it was “too fancy” wording 🥳😂
---
Now they’re announcing a engine swap with a company that does all the above i mentioned🙃
---
Check mate bitch 🥴🤨🤯
---
The vast majority of EVE things are available for free - the limitations being which ship and modules and skills you can use. Usually the more technologically advanced ships as well as those with the greatest currency making ability are behind that premium paywall.
---
You train SP at half the rate as an Alpha currently. You can train up to 5m SP (few months) at which point you can still play but no longer learn more skills. You can inject up to 20m usable SP in specific skills as an alpha when you are capped on training and keep those SP. 
---
Eves community, corporations (read guilds) and fights are all available to you. Content (being mostly player driven) is not locked behind the wall, merely the vehicles which you can use in said content. There will be a % difference in tanking/dps but many players won't have all V skills so this difference is not always appreciable.
---
Gila - A ship available to alphas and omegas is an example of some of the best performance you can get as an alpha. You get around 600 DPS with missile/drone skills with 2x lowslot damage modules where as an omega would get around 700 dps. The tank will similarly be within 15% of the average paid player or ~20% within a player with completely maxed skills. The all V gila might have 85,000 effective hitpoints where as the alpha might have 69,000 effective hitpoints. 
---
You will be able to determine if EVE is the game for you as an alpha. Some veterans play as Alphas. Some premium players extract their SP learned each month and sell it to maintain omega status at a lower cost. At 40m sp you might have a super pilot with Heavy Fighters V and everything you need to fly carriers on that specific pilot, you might elect to extract the 2m sp you train as an omega each month and sell it to other pilots. Although this halts training, it allows you to maintain the Omega status and thus maintain access to skills and ships at much less cost to yourself (Read in game currency).
---
x Premium status (Omega) can be bought with in game currency - this is usually not an option until you have a fair bit of knowledge and minimally a couple paid months of training under your belt.
---
depends on how quickly you learn

Literally all that is happening, is that CCP is translating eve into korean, so korean players can play it in their own language. That's all this is.

I know about the whole Astrero vs Stratios thing but for me, the stratios is just much more to my liking. I will also be partaking in PVE elements as well so I wanted something with a bit more firepower and armour than what the Astero offered. The Covert ops cloak skills are in research and will be until about the 13th so I've been limiting WH space as much as I can but I just wasn't expecting a gate camp in an area I had visited so many times before.

Larger ships aren't necessarily better. A battleship will have a hard time hitting a frigate (unless specifically designed to do so), for instance. Every ship size has their use.

---
You can use Stratios to do HiSec DED sites, I liked it as well, still it is one of my favorite ships. But definitely not a good starter ship in WH exploration.
---
Dont care to feel anything about him ingame but def dont like him irl 
---
yeah can't imagine how a capital that can tank 150k dps for hours can defend itself gee what ever will the poor defenseless miners do
---
Eh, I have tested this probably more extensively than anyone else in eve.  I am pretty sure CCP based the first gen fighter nerfs off my testing results.  If you are going to use a Dromi, using 3xSS fighters is better than 2xLight+1xDromi against frigate sized ships.  The only case this is not true is at range over 100km from the carrier hull itself due to the sustained chase speed advantage of lights over SS fighters.  However, in this case Dromi's also fail the sustained chase speed, and 3x Light is actually more optimal.
---
A max range faction tackle is on the border of this range, when considering spiral intercept courses.  Manually piloting the fighters using 2xLight+1xDromi is the best option, but requires manually intercepting the orbit of the frigate, and a high skill pilot can scram the Dromi off in a few ticks.  (Also tested multiple times).
---
Can you run that many alts on a single fiber line?
---
No one claimed there will be a no-tidi eve; just that latency will improve to "playable" levels
---
If 10,000 ppl are on a different server and nobody is logged into eve .. is eve alive or dead ..😮🤔
---
Tbh I think that would be a cool affect to make rorq mining less safe. You have to dock every 30 mins because of a roaming fleet, but it resets the ramping yield. You can get people that play it safe, and those that say yolo and risk it for ticks. It’s like putting more FSUs and damage mods for super ticks.
---
haws have 400m sigres. capital guns have 10k
---
thing is I'm pretty sure supers are only like 15 or 20 or something so you couldn't throw an extra zero on or something, you'd just make it 20k and make sure you jump near optimal 
---
If this tech demo fails .. approx 5 years you’ll see a noticeable drop .. it will come back to what the lowest active player login looks like to trigger the kill switch .. I’d guess around 4-5k active players per hour to pull the plug

Define kicking ass. There are people who can lead hundreds of players into a successful battle. There are people who can supply exactly the type of ships those hundreds of people need. There are people who ensure that your other neighbour is not going to invade you while you're kicking ass with those hundreds of friends. And there are people who recruit those hundreds of players and make them understand what they're supposed to fly and how they're supposed to fly.
---
Each of them is kicking the ass in a different way. This isn't a game with arenas, battlegrounds and other artificial ways of playing. Shit here is real.
---
No krab marks :(((
---
As an Alpha, you are limited how far you can train, which in turn limits the range of ships you can fly, guns you can shoot, etc. However, the breadth of what you can do as an alpha is quite deep (compared to some other games). You can spend quite a bit of quality time as an Alpha.
---
As an Omega, you train twice as fast and can train into any skill, so after some time training (or spending money to inject) you can fly anything.
---
An Alpha can certainly kill an Omega, but the odds will usually favor the latter. Also, EvE is not tiered (World of Tanks comes to mind) so a day 1 character in a day 1 ship can find themselves fighting a Year 5 character in a year 5 ship. That usually isn't even close.
---
You guys have eyes right?
---
I think this deserves a laugh.
---
Free gets you playing. That's all you need to know. Once you you play you'll realize more. By the way, if you do pay you'll still have to train much of what you can train by playing for free. 
---

Let that sink in on both sides here 
---
Except carriers, which have instant teleportation (jump drive), instant lock speed (nsa) infinite locking range, capital dps and almost perfect application to any ship you fly against
---
read the thread moron
---
The most important thing in eve is joining a corporation (the games version of a guild). Older players are the best resource for information and while there are a lot of tryhard bitter vets there are also an equal number of newbie friendly groups.
---
Yeah interceptors sig tank very well which is why them and assault frigates are able to hold tackle over most other frigates. I do agree with you about all the fighter speed bits, but as you said, destroyer+ cannot feasibly outrun fighters and will take the full brunt of the damage.  Of course you could use really niche over-propped fits or just really blingy fits and/or t2 logi to survive in small scale, but t2 logi makes you much less engage-able and niche fits designed to tank carriers cannot do much else, as you are already limiting viable roaming choices to a handful of ships. My main complaint with carriers is the way they force most ships out of the meta, as they can deal with most subcaps without a problem, and without support. 
---
AKA what i'd like to see changed is dromis switched to paints, sirens switched to damps and application against destroyers and cruisers reduced. These changes discourage people dropping solo/n+1 carriers because they wont be as useful without support subcaps to boost their application, and they wont have the tackle ability that should belong to interceptors, dictors and other subcaps (opening up roles for newer pilots to be useful in home def fleets). Meaning that to solve the problem of subs in your space, you cant just light a cyno and jump carriers, you need to put a little more thought into your composition, while leaving the carriers high damage as is. thanks for taking the time to read this.

I'd agree with you there, especially in large fleet fights. Don't get me wrong, I love Eve but it took me a long time to get started and get over my incorrect expectation of the gameplay.

Sorry but after flying Angel sub caps and Trig sub caps.

---
Why ? People are leaving the game cause of this shit. Why keep instead of completely exterminating it ? Why replace actually playing people with more AFK rorqs or bots ? If it would kill off rorqs, then so be it.
---
shouldn't the plate be NUL BTW and the logo be INIT
---
and you missed a hole for Tasmania in the windscreen 
---
(Remembers when they actually were instant lock and perfect application right after the changes in 2016)
---
EVE is only as complicated as you want it to be. Like a lot of skills, it just takes practice and repetition to get the hang of something.
---
Watch some of Suitonia's EVE IS EASY videos. He flies cheap, easy to access ships in PvP situations (Youtube channel is "eve is easy"). He also streams on twitch (twitch.tv/suitonia).
---
You're never gonna do anything of worth unless you drop \~$2,000 for injectors. And even then you are still light-years away from doing anything of worth. Alpha or Omega.
---
Technically correct, the best kind of correct.
---
Rorquals add ore to the game whereas VNIs get a little bit of isk added to the game.
---
I did not even know I could do that thanks for the heads up. My one concern is people in null can also see me so my chance of being ganged is higher then j

It'd just yield more for the folks who've already got all the Rorq's in the world. They don't often care if you tackle them because they'll just drop a handful of supers on you and continue mining. 
---
As he explained you know there are things you can do to catch them.
---
If they are running in nullsec or lowsec you can just wait outside their exit for them to return. You know its gonna take less than 20 minutes.
---
I don’t even know what that is
---
Will probably be increased tracking over time

XD i hope this a joke killmarks for killing npcs there wouldnt even be enough space on ships to fit them all 
---
It was tongue-in-cheek dipshit.
---
TRIGLAVIAN VNI. Ability to mine like a rorqual while using damaviks as drones. Comes with 6 skill injectors and "boop biib" bot skin.
---
HAW dreads start to perform on par with carriers around the Cruiser level of targets.  And without changing SS fighters, carriers will still have a baseline level of dps that applies to everything.  I think that conceptually this is OK if balanced properly.  
---
Right now fighters are fairly binary.  If they can catch up, and if you don't warp away, they can own your face.  This is why they are popular in situations like gate camps and home defense.  Bubbles for the former, and chasing people off for the later.
---
Thematically I like the idea of carriers as home defense, but the current implementations are bit off.  Possible options are NSA seige mode and minor changes to the fighter attacks (adjust fighter logarithmic scaling mod, stat designed for this purpose, and SS fighter ship damage mod, another stat designed for this, currently at 0.2 and should probably be at 0.1 or 0.15)

End of thread. Also, I'm miserly as hell.

This... is a terrible idea.
---
Mission runners kill thousands of NPCs, and will likely never lose a ship.
---
Even the elite PvP'ers only kill a couple dozen players before they lose a ship and go make another.
---
So you could have marks for 30 kills, or you could have marks for 30k kills.
---
posted the fit, check the comment above :)
---
Thank you, I think I’ll go mess with mine this weekend
---
As opposed to the abyssal runner that can't see you on scan and has a spot you know they will come out of?
---
&gt;the average player can afford to whelp hundreds of them?
---
Whether or not I can afford to is irrelevant. I do not like spending time krabbing sonif I’m constantly losing ships that means I have to spend more time doing that. I’m sure this sentiment is not entirely foreign to many players.
---
More importantly, a Corp or alliance that doesn’t spend its money on its members is much more likely to be seen unfavorably from those at the bottom. SRP is one of the most common ways to do this, but things like free/low-cost JF services are also ways to show some gratitude towards members and incentivize them to participate more and just generally enjoy their favorite gameplay more.
---
For a real-world example, just look at how many employers have various benefits packages. I’ve worked for one contractor that had a really shitty program and it really helped shape my negative view on their business as a whole. 
---
&gt; I never said they use twitter etc?
---
&gt; eve at its rawest technical level is like IRC / twitter with everyone screaming into the same thread at once
---
Not true, IRC, twitter, and I'll go one further and say paypal because you also cited that. Process transactions that largely have no dependency on each other. Unlike a game server where most of those interactions need to happen sequentially to avoid desync and other problems.
---
&gt;100,000,000s of clients are able to push network packets to a server without issues.
---
That's not the issue, at all. It's 1000's of clients interacting with each other in a real time simulation. It's the real-time simulation that is slowing down. That doesn't happen with twitter and other examples you cited.
---
&gt;Check mate bitch
---
Whatever you need to tell yourself to feel smart.
---
It's important to start from a place based in reality. If the "average" player could whelp hundreds of t1 battlecruisers no one would have or need SRP programs.
---
You dock your rorq for every roaming fleet?
---
What?
---
It’s a little early for April fools
---
Your chances of being ganked in nullsec are WAY WAY WAY less then in Jspace.
---
Jspace you don't have local to watch for.  You don't even need to dscan in nullsec until you see someone in local.
---
The worst risk is that you get ganked going gate to gate, and what I usually recommend my newbros is to go and scan out a sector with a cheap scanner and then if you jump into a gatecamp you don't lose a buncha loot.
---
Then go back and run sites and start bringing out loot as you feel its too much to lose.  In and out. 
---
If they get insane tracking like the other guns you may even be able to kill drones with anti cap guns. 
---
Agreed. Morales probably one of the biggest benefits of any good SRP program. You can kind of see that sentiment in how many SRP payouts favor support ships that are often lost a lot or don’t get the benefit of being on killmails as often.

also make sure you have auto-repeat on your hacking modules off. it can save you a few seconds between hacking attempts

well having them on the other side in a different color would be a cool idea. in many games you can track pve and pvp kills alike.

they'd need other milestones for each mark though. love to see someone grid the first 1m npc kills in some strange minmaxed way

The fit I use does gamma and electrical equally well. The only ones I avoid are darks and firestorms. Spendy though, tis true. I'm kind of a pussy about it tbh, I only farm t3 and t4s for the materials and such to make the ships. Dont need the isks

So not a dick to someone in game, just a dick in general. Got it, thanks for clearing that up.

Good stuff, thanks.

I mean, they did literally add a feature that tracks all of your activity, including stupid PvE kills.  But what to call something that tracks activity? Maybe Activity Tracker?

The t4 &amp; t5 start paying pretty well. Most of the time it's easy if you just kill neuting and webbing ships first (then the damavik if it spawns)

It's probably one of the safer and more effective options to learn the ropes of T3. Just be careful to not take the Proving Conduit unless you intend to PVP... and probably lose it to a blingy cruiser. :)

Which time? There were Temp rage quits after losing a falcon, spies in fleets relaying intel, BB vs SF drama, SASH v VEGNA drama etc. There were at least 2 times I was present where he'd just rage quit and a fleet would be FCless (not like a HED-GP gatecamp needed a master FC, but still). Egos got in the way at times - eventually, there was burnout and you could tell he just wasn't having fun like he used to in fleets. 
---
Regardless, 2012 Bombers Bar was still some of the most fun I've had in Eve..
---
Most people probably don't know or remember the details - only that there *was* drama. I was in VENGA at the time so watched everything unfold.

Game servers do not need to be transactional, they push the intent of an action but the server is ultimately just getting witness statements to process based on any number of patterns / practices they can use. Example, 10,000 clients all screaming "i'm still tethered" at the server doesn't need to be processed individually, given all you need to do is have a random count for that tick in that location act as verified witnesses to the claim. You don't trust clients per say, but you can trust multiple clients all saying the same thing to infer what the predication of that statement may be. The server then pushes back the the clients confirmation on variety of actions, "I agree you're tethered", "I agree you initiated a doomsday" etc etc. By your logic you treat everything as 1:1 behaviours which is probably why you advocate Hardware is the silver bullet... fuck moores law, we have a new theory now... just download more ram.
---
PayPal / Twitter / Facebook etc were cited exactly as the way i stated them... they handle multiple inbound packets to the API, which isn't about what happens next its about their ability to push a large amount of data over the pipe and not result in fucking CCP Launcher notices "We're being DDoSd again,..."  Again, you're projecting your own confirmation bias here.
---
Real Time Simulation works on game loop ticks.. a typical game loop is 16ms (1x frame) and in 16ms you can actually achieve a lot of processing if you're not fighting your way also back to the main UI thread (which it will have to drop a frame at the very least). Servers don't act on real-world data points live, they work on basis of patterns. To use my point earlier, you could have 10,000 clients all screaming down the pipe the same thing over and over, you can instead leverage random selection, choose witness at random and have them be the source of truth to cut down on wastage. For example, having 1000 titans all on grid don't need to be told that TitanA has locked up TitanB,  that's between only these two clients...however the rest of the 998 titans will need to be enabled to then lock up either titan (assuming one breaks tether)...ok so state has changed, which you could then have 998 titans all screaming at the server "can i lock now" ...by your thinking you would then have the server execute functions that verify per titan, where you could pick 8 random titans in that pool asking the question(s) and have them be the baseline for truth... "well my 8 witnesses have all validated you can, so from this point on between 0-16ms or more...the titan is unlocked until both the originating titan and targeted titan tell me the outcome of their behaviour" etc.

But anyway, i'm sure hardware will solve that problem. Fuck doing different patterns... download more ram.

As for sentence structure, now you're backing out with "i read it wrong" ...intrinsic cognitive load is your fall back position. Like i said, i'll call you if i need a wordpress blog stood up chump.

Worked out great for the angel caps

This. I'm totally fine with some players being enthusiastic about this, but I am not one of them. This demo celebrates the opposite of the reason I fell in love with EVE. EVE is a sandbox and I totally support the players that like that corner of it. But poke me when there's a demo for the opposite corner.

nah eh velociraptor

That’s pretty much what I’m wanting.  Any place you’d recommend where I can find out how to make that?

Probably just from other people. Not sure on a repository of excel forms for eve.
