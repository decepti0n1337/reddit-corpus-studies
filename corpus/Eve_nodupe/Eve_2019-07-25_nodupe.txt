Because that's so much worse for the game than killing 1 NPC? I get what you're saying, I just don't think it matters.
---
---
---
Talk is cheap and pilots who post ideas and don't play are just pissing in the wind. OP could post the next "meta" comp right here and now but it would still be meaningless if you never logged in and undocked.
---
Yeah, I mine a little for extra isk but I wouldn't want to bother with the train or cost of a rorq.  A couple hours a week keeps me mostly solvent and limits the RL cost of buying Plex for isk.
---
I dont think they did. CCP wanted the Rorq meta, they wanted more supers and titans. I honestly think they just fucked up really hard. There are plenty of ways to nerf the Rorq without making excavs go boom. Like removing them all together from the game.
---
This is where you’re pants on head retarded - no one cares about the wip in citadels.  Or citadels fittings and cargo.  Why the fuck was fort knocks knocked over?  The one theme was all dat loot.  Had there not been a huge payday for pulling that off I’m not sure it would have gotten as much attention.  Would have been just some other keepstar in some dumb Wormhole.
---
K you’re beyond help.
---
Sure kiddo
---
If they made it "kill or die to another player" I'd be all over this. Might actually make me try PVP. As it stands now I can see how it could be fun, I just can't justify doing it since I don't get anything out of it and it is, in fact, the only activity in this game where it is pretty much 100% assumed you're going to lose ISK. (not that losing isk is inherently a bad thing, I just don't have enough to throw away repeatedly)
---
Don't be afraid of lowsec and nullsec. I have friends who played for years and never leave high sec and I feel like they are missing out on alot of cool things.
---

---
Sure you will die alot. But the higher the risk, tye greater the award ;)
---
No I just stumbled upon it and shocking who’s shitting up another thread with a bullshit argument... /u/querns_gsf
---
How'd you lose DST in high sec to 4 torandos? Did you have any tank at all or were you pure cargo space fit. My occator is pretty gank resistant in high.
---
Fort Knocks was knocked over because it was the hardest target in j-space, not for the loot. Everyone thought it was invincible and the couple of InitiativeDOT guys that did all the work wanted to try to take it down anyways.
---
It’s true!
---
Except "calling in the umbrella" can be done by a frigate and nobodys gonna risk 10b to give slightly better boosts. It'll become a suitcase and compression factory again
---
Uh huh.

DONT EVEN BOTHER TAU TRUST ME

18 months ago was January 24, 2018. The daily average during that time was 3,171,464 isk. Today's sell is 3,840,000 isk.  20% ish.
---
Ah I see. That's a real bummer.
---
Subtly punishing players the more accounts they have? I can actually get behind this idea from a personal perspective (I'm a fan of one player one account). I know that's just my personal bias though. Overall we should be encouraging people to have as many accounts as possible so that CCP makes more money and can put more resources into this game.
---
So that made him completely irrelevant to speak about it?  So dense.
---
As relevant as, say, if I was on a talk show speaking of it. That was just, like, his opinion, man.
---
A lot of people will log in to kill 1-5 npc's they can get from the lowest anom or mission, even have their trading alts do it. If they needed a real player kill how many would just not log in, let alone not get a kill.
---
Isn't that how it is now...
---
We have about 6 larger structures in the wormhole, all kind of covering the areas of the WH for different things. So the whole WH is basically setup for a "base area" about 4 months ago we got evicted by Wingspan and we setup some where new.
---
Just have a jamming ship jam the Rorq...  The PANIC doesn't work unless the have a rock/ice targeted.   Jeez it's not that OP...
---
Oh man, I’ve had so many stories, I’ve been ransomed in lowsec in an asteroid belt, I’ve been gate camped, I’ve been ambushed in relic sites, the works. Fly cheap, and die. A lot. That’s how I learned this game.
---
Yeah I’m gonna see how far this little egg can last me only paying one sub for a while till shit settles down.
---
I'm not shooting NPCs for any amount of SP. NPCs never did anything to me or mine.
---
They think so anyway
---
Jam the Rorq so it loses lock on rock or ice and panic module won't work.   It's not that hard.
---
Lmao welcome to Eve where billions can be destroyed in seconds. Now I would check your killmail loss and double check the system you died in. If the security status is under .5 you were in low sec meaning no Concord Police to protect you from another player shooting. Now even in high sec you can get killed or “ganked” because Concord is a reactive not preventive measure.
---
You really do have trouble with posting, don't you? Take a breather.
---
You win some, you lose some
---
eveglish?
---
On each toon, maybe 2 minutes (8 minutes total) thats if im just moving stuff from the storage to the customs office, and I do this from within the tether range of the structures we have.  
---
If I'm hauling PI stuff between POCO to the station its about 10 minutes per toon, and if it's POCO to POCO its maybe 15-20 per toon. So max its like 1 hour every 4 days. Usually how long it takes for my pocos to fill up on all my toons, and then by that time I usually have enough for 1B+ worth of nanite paste.  
---
I can plex an account within 9-10days only spending an hour doing it. I'll usually haul a few Bill in a cloaked up ship like an Astero or Proteus so it's pretty "safe" and I usually have a lot of ISK left over after plexing to replace any ships I lose if I pvp for that week. Or I buy fuel/injectors for alts/ship module upgrades/ or whatever else I may need.  
---
My main is only 18.5m SP, my 3 other toons that do PI are sub 2m SP  
---
I'm extremely fortunate that my friends had a WH setup before I even started up EVE so I was able to get into it and start mining goo/gas and then do PI. It took me like a month to get enough for PLEXing my 2nd account since it takes awhile to make a lot of nanite paste on 1 toon.
---
Do smartbombs still act as a firewall to bombs?
---
Ya know what, i think i might. Maybe there's some false assumption I have as a result of Frontier being a really crappy developer and the playerbase being really crappy human beings.
---
All of Elite dangerous is bugged out the wazoo, including account creation. Is there anything of that nature I need to know for the first hour of game play for Eve?
---
&gt;  If one regions is not enough to satisfy a bloc, they'll take more.
---
Because blocs can only viably protect so much, goons dubbed it the tantrum radius which is basically the area we can feasibly drop our proverbial cock on the table.
---
If blocs start taking more sov that means those regions will be significantly less safe as they are outside the tantrum radius.
---
You don't dual-fit an Astero. You fit it for exploration, toss in a scram or two, and use it's superior stats to beat up other explorers. Killing the competition means more relic sites for you. If someone competent-looking shows up you run. The real reason you can't fight in an exploration Astero isn't the fit, but that you have hundreds of millions of relic loot in the hold.  
---
Or if you are 1337pvp you can do exploration fit, and if you find a target you warp out of d-scan range and refit to fight them.
---
“Why’d I die I used the recommended fitting...”
---
Ok Olmeca.
---
No u
---
News at 11.
---
One thing about eve is that even the worst assholes after killing you may reimburse you for the ship you lost and give you some tips on what mistakes you made. There are some bad apples obviously but the community is actually quite friendly and people help you out if you ask them. As for what you need to know, there's a shitload of info you need to know so I'll just copy paste you the best answer that's used a lot.
---
This is a copy / pasted message, but fell free to answer it if you have any questions.
---
First of all, take the time to do the career agent missions. It will show you many things in the game (exploration, mining, industry, hauling, etc).
---
Then, well Eve is a sandbox, so you will need to figure out what you want to do. As a new player, you are not strictly limited, but what ever you do, Eve can be dull and boring, mechanics are complex at first because of the amount of informations you need to learn but once you understand them it's generally a lot easier. What ever you want to do, try to have fun or enjoy the complex interactions mechanics are creating, so basically don't grind isk for the sake of grinding isk.
---
- Want to explore the stars alone ? Buy an exploration frigate, a cloaking device and go around the stars looking for data and relic sties. Maybe join a wormhole corp and enjoy space where frontiers change everyday, and need scanning on a daily basis. There are some newbie friendly wormhole corps that can teach you the way of Bob.
---
- Want to join one of the large nullsec empire ? Join TEST, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet or Brave. They are all well known newbie friendly corporation/alliance and they will give you free ships, a place in fleet, and people are generally willing to teach you. They also offer good opportunities for new players to make isk (exploration and salvaging mainly).
---
- Overwhelmed by large organizations but still want to join an active PvP corp ? Try and look for a small faction warfare corp or alliance, there are plenty of them and they will also guide you, get you a place in fleet and you will enjoy endless content.
---
- Want to settle in a bit more in "security" ? Run some combat mission in HS. But try not to do that, really.
---
- Want to become the space Rockefeller ? Look into market, region trading, and all the shit. You won't blow space ships but if you enjoy raw data, data analysis (like, real data analysis) this is your thing. Isk revenue is potentially infinite.
---
- Want to mine rocks and turn them into modules, ships, ammunition ? Start mining and industry. Pro tip, don't do it alone in HS you don't have a single chance, join Goons (= Karmafleet), nullsec have way more valuable ore and Goons are basically the safest most organized industry in the game. You can also join some renter corp but that's up to you.
---
- Want to build your own corp ? Build it with some friends, maybe to do industry, or PvE, or PvP. My 5 isk : FW is a really good way to make isk and have some fight for new players. Low class WH can also be interesting.
---
A short list of advice :
---
- [This is your bible](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)
---
- Right clic EVERYTHING.
---
- Eve is a sand box, figure out what you want to have fun doing and don't bother what other thinks. There is no right way to play Eve.
---
- Faction do not matter. Pick one you feels seems cool and then ignore it for ever since you can fly any ship of any faction without any difference.
---
- Eve is also a dangerous game. Don't use ships you can't afford to loose. Both players and NPCs can wreck you quite fast, even later in the game when you will fly big expensive ships.
---
- People will kill you. No matter where you are, people can and will kill you, even in high security space. HS is actually the worst place to be, because you think everyone is friendly when it's really not the case. Outside, it's a lot more easier, everyone is your enemy.
---
- The very same people that will kill you can also be the same people that will explain to you why you died if you ask them. People in the game are generally friendly and don't mind teaching new players.
---
- Don't get attached to your ships.
---
- Eve shine when played with other people. Don't be afraid of recruitment policies, knock at the door, join a corp, have fun with others.
---
- Learn of your mistakes, don't get angry. If you died, it's your fault.
---
- r/evenewbies it's a good place to ask stupid question. r/evejobs it's a good place to look for a corp.
---
Yeah they are, and that's why there was an outrage about it. But the issue above was giving out free skill points. I do not recall them ever saying they wouldn't do that.
---
On top of that all, boosters are just shittier delayed release free skill points, and they've given those out for ages.
---
My favorite is when someone asks if the gate is green while were holding on it, inevitably 10 exceedingly exceptional players jump through the gate and get blobbed.
---
Why not just scan down the sig?  There’s hundreds of celestials in a system. Like 3 sigs?
---
you've never tried jamming a rorq with its indy mod turned on have you?
---
I'm more surprised something happened in Stain than Test losing a titan.
---
Best thing to happen in null.. this black out forces people to either use their brain a tiny bit or loose expensive drones or even ships. Its actually fun reading all this concern about it while in actuality a simple scout and vigilance on sigs and dscan should be enough warning to let you know something might pop up soon. Learning to fly and fit a rorq properly is also more of a requirement now. And the one change i like the most; actually being active and communicating on comms. Best thing ccp ever did. Hope it never changes. The salt is amazing.
---
agreement
---
Well I can safely say that we dont do evictions so some of that seems really fishy
---
They also cost 1/10th less, and can be r rep tanked if you need them to live a little longer.  Belt rats don't hit THAT hard.
---
Yea was a fun brawl. GF

It was some wingspan guys that did end up evicting us. I believe the guy that started it has now left Wingspan, I'm not going to mention names.

Great fight. Even at 5am. Thanks to each and every pilot in system.

It's a pretty damn limited form of selling, though. Not like you're going to skip titan training with a Meteor pack or whatever. It gets you in a frigate or destroyer a little faster.

---
Yea, it was my fault. I didnt blame anyone but myself.
---
Cmon bud, this is absurd even for you.  The umbrella saves the excavs by chasing off the predators, stop being an idiot.
---
yes but you need a 40 man fleet
---
That pack combined with the +750K SP from RAF and the +600k from this event gave me over 2m sp on 3 different alts. Imagine doing this over a LARGE amount of accounts - like those SP farms some people have set up. It cuts down on the time needed to train to *extractable* levels by a pretty large amount. I'm not super economist or anything, but that can't be good for the game, right?
---
Are you naturally this dense, or is this an acquired skill? The *point* he is making is this:
---
In what universe should it be considered "fair and balanced" for a Rorq pilot to accept that even with perfect play, he stands to lose 1-5 drones to every gaggle of retards that can get into the system, line up their shot, and press two buttons without fucking it up? Oh, and the value of **one** of those drones would buy half a squadron of shitfit bombers.
---
Getting into system/catching them unaware is a joke with the blackout, and you have all the time in the world to line up your shot to make sure you don't fuck it up.
---
When the only winning move is to *not play*, you obviously have a major balance issue with that interaction.
---
Anyone who refuses to commit three stealth bombers because of "the umbrella" needs to have their head examined. You can't even load grid after cynoing onto the field in the time it takes from the bombers decloaking to their bombs exploding.
---
&gt; In what universe should it be considered "fair and balanced"
---
I never stated or implied that it was "fair and balanced"
---
&gt; When the only winning move is to not play
---
Give me a fucking break. There are mining options that do not involve excavators.
---
&gt;Give me a fucking break. There are mining options that do not involve excavators.

Quote the full line or fuck off. Taking sentence fragments to remove the context is literally the lowest form of discussion.
---
How is that any different from someone who only logs in to update their skill queue? If anything that just pushes people into action faster because they don’t have to wait weeks to get to where they want to be, barring skill injections.
---
If my dread didn't bounce like a mofo that Hel would have died.
---
So how long are your cycles? Are you only checking every 3 days?
---
We dont participate in TZ tanking since we want the content as well. We just dont want to be blobbed by 200 titans vOv.
---
Better?
---
Not really. I like my Hecate, but anything works.
---
Just hop into a ship and go around blapping people! Just be wary you might run into other peoples who might smoke you :p
---
Thanks for proving my edit right.
---
It was a shitty roll on the timer, we were not thrilled either.
---
I did no such thing. The umbrella doesn't chase off stealth bombers in any capacity, and stealth bombers are how excavators die.
---
Talking logic to these people does not work. They want pve activities to have “danger” which keeps rolling out to I want everything to die to me easily and remove counters to me killing stuff. They are not happy with Rorqs because they are hard to kill and even when they can suppress the ability to have good yield by killing excavators it’s not enough . They want everyone to jump in
---
Barges and die because easy kills are fun for them and they do not sow. That’s why you hear all this talk of removing rorqs ability to mine/panic and even cyno It will be great for a while for hunters until mining moves to highsec because no one wants to get killed every time they undock as there is really no way your going to get subs to sit around and watch some guy in barges mine. After a few weeks people may try procurers and the meta would shift to all the hunters in t3 cruisers like before. 
---
Not a fan of blackout but at least you have a chance of being saved in a rorq. I doubt much mining would happen with these “great” ideas people keep throwing around.
---
4 hour cycles. I actually manage the storage &gt; POCOS everyday. But from POCO &gt; station is every few days and from POCO/Station &gt; other planets is whenever it's needed. But I almost never run out of resources because I have 4 toons working (22 planets total), and i pretty much have 1 extractor/10 heads + storage + launch pad on each planet, so I pull a lot. I don't have to move very often maybe every 2ish weeks or so. Once i notice a decent drop in resources. There are certain planets that I pull 2 resources from but its not too bad.  
---
I think I'm going to save up a little bit more and buy \~6 injectors and train 2 more toons for PI on my main account so I can have 6 toons = 36 planets and even more resources.
---
Which was the entire point of this thread of comments.
---
yeah lol p3ak really ruined T-C, the alliance they created in the first place
---
No not really we adapt and move on but it’s funny when after people get what they want they ask to make it even easier. Without local there is a risk/reward decision with mining in a rorq but hunters are reeeee because people chose the safe path. Can’t have every path lead to 100% chance of death or no ones going to mine in those conditions. It seems to me people want to force those that do mine or rat into the position of simply being available to harvest at ease. If you remove danger for hunters as well won’t the kills just become shallow and meaningless ?
---
Look at this Venture and all its killmarks
---
Someone suggested having an ecm frig to web/scram the drifter down (instead of the astero with web/scram that I used). Not sure how well it would work though.
---
I like agreeance better, personally
---
industry job materials will drop. the BPOs will go to asset safety (not sure about BPCs)
---
New ones besides the Goliath? Goliath sucks because it slows down the speed
---
They most definitely aren't even close to the only way they die bud, you just look silly now
---
Haha, this is so good.
---
Whoever said anything about removing danger from hunting. Can't y'all, y'know... fight back?
---
We've seen y'all do it before.
---
Mystery solved, RIP.

Sound like our deviant automata" friends are joining the invasion fiesta

WHO IS "I"????
---
AAR:
---
Earlier today a cheeky recking crew lad managed to get eyes on an APOC rorqual busy chewing on gravel in a belt.  RC Machariels and guardians were hurriedly formed and stacked onto a titan bridge. Before a satisfactory number of RC pilots joined fleet, the rorq showed signs of leaving the field. RC was forced to play their hand, meager numbers or not.  Tackle was secured, cynos were sorted, and the rorqual was forced to PANIC with the assistance of two RC Hels.  
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Provi responded in kind by forming similarly meager numbers of machariels, which they bridged onto a nereus cyno approximately 250km from the tackled rorq.  As the rorqual exited PANIC and was [removed from the field](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78008984/), RC Hels were pressured to vacate the premesis, lest they be tackled by a very focused dictor pilot, who managed to close within about 50kms before the second hel warped. 
---
Unfortunately, the stress of multiboxing and getthng the hel off field and away from the dictor resulted in minor pilot error.  Instead of warping to the safe in line to the astrahaus (to which he was aligned) one of the RC Hels instead warped to 0.  The Hel Landed with his fighters still deployed (and thus still agressed), and was quickly bubbled by provi forces, which summarily brought in a small dread-bomb to deal with the RC scourge.  
---
At this point all hell broke loose.  Both parties pinged that a Hel was tackled, and that they needed backup (to save and to kill it for RC and provi, respectively).  The RC Hel was entering low shield by the time a brave CALSF logi pilot brought his Minokawa on grid to land much-needed reps to assist the Hel's failing tank.  The brave Mino quickly ate [copious amounts of shit](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78009015/) from brutal and coordinated fire from Provi revelations.  As the RC mino burned, all manner of capitals jumped to RC and provi cynos on grid, tearing through space around the hel and joining the fray.  
---
Both fleets began hemorrhaging dreads to in an orgy of of laser and blaster fire.  Capital hulls on both sides vented atmosphere to space, hurling bodies and detached bulkheads against the half materialized hulls of dreadnoughts, carriers, and fax hulls that began pouring onto the field to support both fleets.  After a few minutes of dread brawling, the order was given to RC to drop the hammer.  RC armour titans and supers burst onto the field and swiftly eliminated the remaining provi capital forces. Provi subcaps were forced to flee the field, lest they succumb to coordinated fire from fighers and token HAW dreads.  
---
In the end the Hel was saved (barely).  RC looted the field.  GFs scrolled in local.  Lessons were learned on both sides.  Fun was had.  Till next time Provi o7
---
So much ignorance in here because you make up 60% of the comment section
---
I didn't say "only," now, did I? Besides, a casual perusal of zkb will show you that 95%+ of them die to stealth bombers, at least since local got turned off. Who the fuck cares about before then.
---
Besides, if the umbrella is so big and scary, it behooves you to use the one ship class that is 100% immune to it -- the stealth bomber. Even interceptors have a harder time with it than stealth bombers.
---
Yeah I think there needs to be some kind of brief description for the fits.
---
The other concern I have is that fits change over time as the game changes so any community fits will need to be consistently updated or the whole thing will end up pretty useless to newer players after a couple of years.
---
damn I want see proviboys dunk all HTP supers
---
they do on a ship with crap resists, low HP and no fitting space besides what you need to put strip miners on it, I've watched people get killed by rats before they can hit warp.
---
Why are you booing him, he's right.
---
if you watch the code streams that hasn't really stopped its just done to a lesser extent.
---
Obviously you don't scan celestials that dont have sig bubbles near them.
---
Also, you don't scan each and every moon, the planet would already cover the moons and stations.

Gates and stations aren’t celestials in this sense. Sigs and anoms only appear near planets, usually within 4 AU but I’ve seen some that were probably a bit further.

One thing to note is that this will slow down the warzone see sawing, if you got to grind things in a set order, you can't bring all systems to 99 % then flip a huge chunk of the warzone overnight.

Ha! I don't even mine you numbskull.  Point out the salt.  I'm not salty about anything.
---
And ask far as making risk decisions, I've always done that, in game and in RL, so it doesn't bother me at all.  In fact, I like the fact that EVE forces risk decisions, although if one side of that equation is explosions, that's the one I usually choose.  Generally to my detriment, lol.
---
You are REALLY reaching on this one buddy.  Give it up.
---
Enjoy what, having your delusions proven wrong continually? That seems a bit weird, but I'm not one to kinkshame.
---
They will if they know there is a carrier sitting there to be killed
---
Is this thread real?
---
Adding PI to cap components would be a reasonable fix wouldn’t it? And I say that as a cap builder.
---
It may surprise you to learn that some people genuinely enjoy mining. I sure as hell ain't one of 'em, but I have this weird ability to accept these sorts anyways, and am willing to provide them the means to exercise their weird hobby. It was pretty important to clawing our way back into power, so I'm thankful.
---
So is the ignorance...
---
So, it’s good for you all around. The economy recovers and you do stuff in real life that you’ve been putting off. Truth is, nullsec shouldn’t feel safe.
---
you can ignore it if you want but you literally used the 'its not saving them all so it doesn't count' argument.
---
The super umbrella saves your excavs, without it you'd be significantly worse off.
---
&gt;After being in a bomber gang, sitting cloaked with 6 other bombers, all 33km off a rorqual mining with Excavators. This experience has ruined Excavator mining for me personally.
---
You interjected yourself into a discussion with another person, at the time i had no idea you were defending your significant other so here, let me show you where your girlfriend was salty about having mining "ruined" because some risk was added.
---
YOUR posting is salty because I went after your girlfriend.
---
Sorry for late reply, been busy with work. The Legion I prefer because it has the ability to fit a massive buffer tank and have neuting power combined with drones. They're beasts.  
---
With the Tengu I prefer, I am active rep. It tanks insane amount of DPS and hits out with HAMS for 700 dps.   
---
The Loki can also do what the Tengu can, I just prefer the Tengu to it.
---
As for being Alphad by a Loki. It was probably 100mn Arty fit for kiting?
---
A bit soon to repost a high profile video, though it is good
---
No, I used the "it's saving literally none of them" argument. Because it's saving literally none of them. Thinking otherwise is actual brain damage.
---
I hate everything about giving away and buying/selling of SP
---
Yeah you're right my bad. Over 1000 dps with heavy drones is perfectly reasonable for a mining ship.
---
I guarantee you, I'll start mining with a hic cloaked on grid
---
Wingspan was still able to make a successful delivery
---
Yeah, I'm reading what he said, and I don't see salt there.  Having an activity ruined in this game doesn't mean someone is salty about it.
---
You so desperate for salt that you are licking dirt and pretending it's salt now?
---
Seriously, you thought the girlfriend comment was supposed to bother me, lol?
---
What are you? Like 12 years old mind in a 50 year old body?
---
Like a good neighbor Eve Scout is there!
---
Fucking *throws self out window*
---
Good luck. Caps have enormous sensor strength
---
Yep...pretty much this.  
---
This is actually what I think.  Ask anyone that actually does Rorqual mining what would happen if local in Null went away, and almost all would tell you pretty much exactly this.  
---
Alienate your multibox Rorqual players, kill excavators, cut ore production, as well as upset most PvE Null people while at the same time make PvP people thrilled.  
---
Maybe that is what they wanted, maybe that is what Eve needed, but in the end that is what CCP bought so I hope that every one enjoys it.  :-)
---
Please don't joke about this, what if dad sees what you wrote ?
---
You need a hug
---
ccp stop

wow rude
---
abyssal loot is going down in price because ISK is less available (along with other modules in the game), but abyssals are just as safe as the were before.
---
Oh you guys still around?

Addictive*
---
&gt;Before a satisfactory number of RC pilots joined fleet, the rorq showed signs of leaving the field. 
---
I'm not sure exactly how you came to that conclusion. The Rorqual pilot was me, on an alt, and I was there deliberately as bait. Leaving would have kind of defeated the purpose. - I was well aware that (at least) two RC droppers were roaming the area, and that DeadDuck and Odracir were running around  in Stratios' looking for things.
---
The hope was that a Hel pilot that had been rather recklessly dropping on people earlier in the day would try to drop me, as he did. Unfortunately I screwed up the cyno on the Rorq (wrong overview tab; didn't see the mobile inhib go up) and my FAUX support didn't get on grid. And thus the sacrificial Rorq died.
---
However thankfully the Hel pilot made a mistake as well, and got tackled on an Astrahus as he attempted to leave grid. A very entertaining dread brawl ensued. It finally ended when RC brought a few supers on grid and our FCs decided not to escalate. (Don't ask me why; I don't know. Provi leaders wisely ignore most of what I say :P)
---
Was very fun, and a Rorqual well spent. Biggest lesson I learned this time: you don't have to *fit it* like a miner to pretend to be one. A few drone damage lows would have come in handy. Some more tank perhaps.
---
same
---
If you want a taste go back and look at old o7 shows where Rise did his elite PvP fits.  Most of what he came up with was truly terrible.
---
After the athanor is anchored a carrier is probably not a bad ship to use in defence if you're in a very small Corp. They're really isk efficient since tethering and docking game pretty much means the only time you'll die is if you get baited and dropped.
---
While it will make a lot of PvP people unhappy, the truth of the matter is that lots lots of people have crafted their game around multibox Rorquals.  It was unexpected by CCP, but should have been very easy to figure out and they have been walking back from it for a very long time.  I was at fan fest when they put out the Rorquals and even a not smart guy like me could see how broken it was.  
---
They were doing it the right way though.  Steady nerfs to the hull and the meta, to give people lots of time to shift out of the it.  
---
Basically flipping the Rorqual switch to the off position during Blackout puts people off.  
---
Oh well...the die has been cast.  Let’s see where it goes.
---
I feel personally attacked
---
&gt;"Games need to be fun"
---
  
---
...something, something **"We are not here to ruin the game, we are here to ruin your game"** \- Goonswarm Federation...circa forever ago.  
---
For reals tho dude,  yea and it goes both ways. No one's trying to ruin your game or use you like a punching bag. People just want content. Feels like you're a punching bag too when a 10 man subcap gang gets titans/supers dropped on them.
---
Yeah this is the problem they continue to fight with, I don't even know if there is a perfect balance where that investment on the field can be worth it but not too overpowered when infinitely scaled.
---
Some people would rather have their real opinion heard, than fellate the popular vote.
---
When was this posted?
---
who cares? they are still worth shooting and still worth defending at 3b, and they need to be sieged in the belt to give off boosts, so they'll still be there.
---
Pretty much this.  
---
People want the 5-7 billion ISK ships though to have the tank of a cruiser, be anchored in space, cyno jammed, and probably even more gimped on cap boosters and tank.  In other words, dead meat without any hope....I guess, but excuse me if I don’t line up to be helpless targets.
---
I imagine PA tied some of the cash at purchase to meeting specific targets.  CCP will be selling out hard with whatever bullshit they can to meet those targets because if they don't then Hilmar won't get paid.
---
sounds like someone's still a bit salty
---
Far out there idea but what if certain planets in Sov Null are turned into "settled/civilized planets" that contribute special materials that you need for supercap construction. Having "sov" means you own the in system planets as well, which allowed certain activities that you can't do on planets that other people own.
---
I imagine "most" PI as small outposts you put on not very hospitable world's, while PI on empire planets is the empires letting you pick at scraps after they called dibs on everything else. Owning sov over a temperate planet lets you put settlers on planet and actually build cities and shit
---
Well, was it a B274 though?
---
&gt;Because it's saving literally none of them
---
This is false, you're not counting any of the excavs that DONT die in rorquals you umbrella saves that otherwise would die, that DO die in places that don't have your umbrella.
---
Lol brain damage, you dumb fuck.
---
Unlikely. The Rattlesnake bonus is only for heavy drones (including Geckos).
---
Was the article written by an edgelord retard?
---
When someone says "i need reps" instead of broadcasting you would too
---
I basically taught myself to fit from watching the eve-kill feed of ships I was interested in and the remaining fumes of Battleclinic (this was about 2012). At least seeing good fits will allow new players to start mimicking them, which is still a step up from throwing whatever they have on a ship.
---
&gt; Having an activity ruined in this game doesn't mean someone is salty about it
---
When you go and post about it being ruined on reddit it sure does slim.  Man, does he polish your armor since you ride out to try and save him like this?
---
Bombers kinda throw your point out the window. We already got individual people multiboxing bombers to kill excavs. That same group will no-risk wipe a barge group. Bombers can scale beyond a handful and even multigroup bomb if barges are spread. If the Rorq panics to protect the barges from bombs its now got a timed grave on its head as the attackers will just wait out the panic and probably take the Rorq too. Excavs are high risk high reward. Mining Drones are low risk low reward.
---
the SP event just started, the log in reward event is a separate thing.
---
obviously FC

When he made it
---

I came to that conclusion because I seem to remember scouts reporting that you had pulled drones or initiated warp or something.  IDK.  I had been drinking (still am, but I was then, too).  GF regardless.  I thoroughly enjoyed the dread brawl as well.  GF man.
---
There's nowhere near enough evidence to conclude that the Triglavians are Jovians.
---
Lol, I wasn't trying to save anyone, I was responding to your retarded mis-id of salt.  Once again, just saying something is ruined doesn't make it salt.  Some of us still know what actual salt is.  You need to get out of the frozen north more, I think your brain cells are rupturing in the cold.
---
0/10
---
Close to the same amount of excavators that were being stolen and resold by olmeca gold. Since he is not doing that anymore they are being destroyed now.
---
1500 dps of light drones will apply perfectly to anything that isn’t a ceptor. Ogres wouldn’t even be able to catch anything cruiser or below and even if something smaller was tackled the effective dps
---
done would be a third of its paper damage at most, massive difference.
---
Thanks

I can't share this with my friends because I'm the only one who has played Eve.

Have this issue too "Unallocated Skill Points Added" but nothing on the skills tab in the character window, nothing in redeem. So not only did it bum me with the lowest possible prize, it then didnt even give it to me. Nice lol
---
Just came back from a break....
---
Ah thats hot.
---
Lol! This is great
---
If the demand doesn't decrease, but the supply does, prices will rise.  However, they're still better to use than a barge cause they mine more even with miner 2's and you don't have to micro manage the ore hold or worry about getting popped by BS rats or a handful of bombers.
---
You didn't escalate because there is only one fc (maybe 2 if you count the potato farmer) in your coalition with the competence to do it and he wasn't online and historically has never tried.  At some point maybe you guys will rip the bandaid off and will use the ships the way they were meant to be used. Maybe. But you need to be willing to lose everything you commit.
---
In the meantime please enjoy you're members reactions to hostile locals touching your tralalas:
---
"bathpone?"
---
"is test around?"
---
"batphone test?"
---
Okay, fine, "none" was a dumb phrase. A few rorquals here and there do get mooked with excavators inside. However, that's statistically irrelevant compared to the loss of excavators occurring without the mother rorqual dying. We've lost over a hundred in the last four days (I lost patience with counting them all, and I only looked at GSF because I was too lazy to rope in other Imperium member alliances.) The umbrella can't do shit to save those.
---
Ironically, more excavators die *because* of the umbrella than they would without it. Why? Without the umbrella, practically no one would undock a rorqual at all. Funny how that works, isn't it?
---
It was part of the push to phase out the old stations in null sec and get people into player owned stations and out of pos. Now it is more of a drive to have more than the bare necessity of stuff in player stations to avoid the possibility of a single person completely screwing over the personal assets of pretty much everyone.
---
Now stuff in corp hangers do drop on destruction or lock up assets for up to a month before you can get them out. If you have a better way then share that since at the very least it should not completely screw over someone coming back to a dead corp or alliance after a couple month break.
---
Some people don't remember what actual salt is, or can't find any, so they run around like 5 year olds calling everything salt.  Kinda devalues actual salt.
---
10/10 ducks
---
Here's something that could in theory work.
---
If you are in a corp/alliance and you go awol for more than 30 days any assets you have get moved to asset safety if the structure is destroyed.
---
That way if the alliance does die while your away you retain your assets.
---
no small roaming gang is gonna try to stop the timer for shits and giggles, people do small roaming gangs to get away from that shit in the first place. You're overcomplicating things too much. The carrier will probabpy be counter productive honestly cause itll bring far more attention, and yeah if a gang or fleet set on killing the structure shows up it may die, there's always that risk, but its a pretty small one, and a carrier would skyrocket it.
---
GF! I loved this! One of the better fights I've had in Eve. Even tho we kinda lost.
---
People used them before they got buffed, but just 1 for the fleet and on the edge of a POS. I don't know how worth they were but I know they were used.
---
No probes? Everyone knows to pack probes (and a launcher).
---
Yes that is the kind of thing that was missing from most of these types of posts is the whole remove the system without taking into consideration what lead to it. To me any suggestion to remove or change something in the game should at least entertain some type of replacement instead of htfu.
---
made minor edit, makes more sense now
---
yea don't join Horde, Spoopy Newbies is a better... in literally every way.
---
but in all seriousness I've heard some horror stories surrounding Horde and their new players, there's still a ton of other groups you can join though.
---
Cyno.up
---
This is all I care about. I've forgotten my depot so many times because I can't save it.
---
My friend, you need to lay off the batphone accusations. You - as well as everybody else - know perfectly well that RC batphones just as hard when there's something on the line. It is well known.
---
You can keep repeating this stuff all you like, everybody knows better. Literally. Everybody. Including your own guys. It's not as if they miss it when NC. and Horde show up to help you out.
---
I really hate asteroes. They aren't really good at anything other than exploring in npc null where you want to scare off other explorers.
---
you undocked?
---
Or... you know... have some people sitting cloaked from your side waiting for them and pop them up? It's not like there is a lack of people in Delve spinning their ships. 
---
You could get a couple of newbros defending and give them a part of your profit if they successfully defend!
---
When blocs blob and harvest with ease is it shallow and meaningless?
---
Gee, I wonder why that happened....
---
Atleast I dont have to infiltrate other corps to get content.
---
She forgot the depot because it wasn’t saved in the fit and she was flying a new ship
---
Lmao not even close, go on Sisi right now and test it. This just goes to show how fucking little you know about capital balance now.
---
You sit here pissing yourself on reddit about how OP caps are but you don't fuck all about them.
---
I'll fucking wait. Go easily track ships going over 450m/s cruiser down.
---
If a mining fleet is weak then just have some defense. Some active gate watchers and more people sitting in the anom with alts. If they drop too much you light a cyno for the umbrella.
---
If the overall price of ore goes up, if you put more effort in mining the profit should go up as well.
---
I can make it for you. Write in-game mail to Izolda Weyland if you're interested.
---
Yeah, but you can't be sitting on the edge of a POS anymore. And that niche use was not really what they wanted, especially for it to disappear when they changed boosts, so then they made it good for mining as well. Obviously since then it has been over/undertuned more than once, and like I was saying, that perfect balance may not even exist.
---
The same way his anti-vac parents did.
---
What a good doctrine for small gang. (5-10) cheap, cruisers down.
---
Whats the current meta or popular right now?
---
Are you saying that having your shit;
---
1. locked away for 20 days, 
---
2. magically teleported to a heavily camped low-sec system,
---
3. incur a fee of 15% market value,
---
Doesn't hurt?
---
What the fuck are you smoking?
---
Yeah... I think just removing or limiting their use of mining drones/excavs and make their boost limited to the grid would be good enough. They'd still have their panic, but to mine you'll risk your barge fleet as it was before.
---
It's not like nobody mined in Null-sec before the Rorq buff...
---
There is no difference in relic/data bonus, that is a role bonus on both the cov-ops and Astero.
---
Plus, the cov-ops ships are slow to align.
---
EVE is pretty much the only MMO in the past 20 years to not have added them, until now.
---
"Uhh, did that section of space just origami itself into a spaceship?"
---
People hate blackout because they've never played without local and they are used to having free intel, etc.  not having local means you have to put some effort into security, and people don't like that.
---
People who DO like that sort of situation tend to be wormholers.
---
Wormholes are where its at if you like actual ship PvP and team effort where every person actually counts.
---
Because these structures replaced outpost where you also dd not lose your stuff ?
---
GFs were had.
---
Carrier/Supercarrier ratting is mostly muscle memory after 10-20 havens. I was just fine watching movie while commiting space slaughter.
---
I seriously doubt you payed 20 accounts per month.
---
That totally depends on what they bring. But solo cap with 2 subs will die fast if they meet any resistance.
---
I thought otto von bismarck was the hecate king. Although looking at the date of his last upload I think it’s time to pass that crown on.
---
Well, it's worth a shot. The Drifter will always aggro the biggest thing on grid, but from experience it usually aggro switches exactly once, and only once during a fight.
---
Remember that it has at least 3 points of warp stab, so if you only have 1 scram or point on it, he'll warp off and make you feel like a boob for wasting your time.
---
Also he has like 2 million EHP so...be prepared to be sitting there for a good hour in your solo rattle.
---
Ye exactly. Its been a shitty implementation all around. No balance around it has been implemented either, just fk you and thats what. But I mean, Im starting to get the feeling that people abused no local to an extent that they have to balance it or restore it.
---
Did you say jump?
---
Nope. Need an Azbel or Fortizar for it.
---
Which makes you log in daily to check when you get the jackpot challenge... or something like that. I miss the days when other players made me log in :/
---
It tells you right on the escalation screen.
---
Just use an Athanor or a Sotiyo.
---
It really doesn't hurt. It's a small chore and the attacker gets nothing.
---
You can just run the EXE for the game directly and login in that.
---
O think there is also a third party launcher.
---
A sieged Rorq is unjammable.
---
I mean, I like dailies... It gives you something to do on days you don't want to make a big commitment. Eve's version is just PI.
---
Technically you can already put a depot in a fit, but only through the esi import/export thing like pyfa uses, and it will show up in your fit window with an unsupported section that doesn't link in chat properly sometimes. It used to be that way with cargo modules before they added a proper section for those. Also used to be able to add depots through custom crafted DNA links, which is what is automatically made when you drag a fit to chat.
---
It is. Now go skill yourself.
---
Those days never went away, dude. Undock something and go out for a fly, see what you can find, hunt people down and shoot them. Don't rely on other people to generate content for you, generate your own content. Don't be a follower, be a leader.
---
You need better friends.
---
Oh shit, my first Silver. Odin bless you, friend.
---
Oh, I just downloaded it and found it it's like WoW but in space. I was expecting a flight sim, lol.
---
I heard jump?
---
Thats why you solo / duo escalation with Dreads.
---
Nice! Could also have some defender missiles on grid to counter the bombs.
---
Can't we just import a list of EvE UNI's fits?  I've found them to be great starting points
---
XDDD wingspan can’t get you if you don’t have a B274
---
Well, outside of that requires an order ;-)
---
Some good ideas like: Remove the 3x reinforce requirement on citadels to be 1x on astrahus, 2x fortizar, 3x keepstar. and Dreads can no longer hit subs. You hit structures and other caps. That is it. 
---
Good, I agree. 
---
But also a lot of terrible ideas: Reduce all armor on all ships by roughly 15%. Moving to where using shield ships actually are relevant. 
---
LOL wat. 
---
Also: Micro Jump Drives Generators that pull ships with them now break after using it. IE, use the module it pulls like 10 enemy ships with it, it breaks after use. 
---
This is a problem only in your mind. 
---
Also: Systems with greater than 12 planets, remove the extra planets. If you are some super lore nerd crying about removing planets in a video game, I guess just make the cap being 12 planets. 
---
The fuck bro. In what fucking way does this effect anything whatsoever. Who in their right mind thinks this is legitimately an issue. At this point I think this maybe just a troll post in a tryhard disguise.
---
Not with a HIC
---
The mass is way off, but it's like that for gameplay reasons
---
You think people giga bump hard now just wait until titans weigh 10x current mass.
---
Hmm I think I’ll name my next character  “Álma  Kýrios”
---
Maybe not nobody, but significantly less people mined in nullsec pre rorq buff.
---
Can confirm. Have an A239.
---
I'm saying if they don't mine better they won't be used so you won't even get a chance to shoot them.
---
OP's post does specifically say this is about losing access to stuff for the 'war effort' (emphasis mine). 
---
OP does *not* say the purpose of burning down a Keep is for looting and plundering. Don't hijack the thread. Make a different thread if you want to discuss that aspect of Asset Safety.
---
Seems like you've been living under a rock for the past few months and he didn't steal your drones
---
Don't mine then go do highsec incursions.

Lol yes let's pillage every citadel owned by a non block in the game.

Gotcha, that makes a lot of sense. We'll keep our carrier pilot docked up and as a last resort if some small gang seems set on bashing.
---
In a similar fashion, does it make sense to be out of system (or safe'd up) as opposed to being on grid with the Athanor while it's anchoring?

The most dangerous places in lowsec are the ones where it connects to hisec, cause the campers wait there for people thinking just what you did: “I have to get somewhere and I’ll just be passing through for a couple jumps.” That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t ever go there, but it’s a big risk that that first gate will be camped, and some ships and fits are better than others at having a chance to beat the campers.

Will inevitably happen, however there will be a lot less people who want to learn the game solo becoming frustrated by the lack of guidance
---
You dont need the docking
---
I assume it's for new players like me. Any SP is good SP in my mind. Getting 50k for 5, 25k for 5, and 10k for 20 days is 575k SP, that's over a bil worth of SP for blapping some rats. It's a quick trip to a belt or the tutorial to knock it out each day. I will certainly be doing it.
---
Also maybe new players will learn about belts, ship fits, ship sizes, etc when trying to figure out how to do these missions. I personally saw tons of dead rats and people hopping to belts earlier to do these missions.

Had a hard time with the shoulder pads, but you should know that the black and green suit is the Bioadaptive one, representing all Triglavians.
---
Yeah, and much more than that. The key is to learn risk management. Also you have to develop thick skin and sincere respect to skillful foes.
---
It's pretty much like a chess of some sort. In chess you could easily lose a strong figure in a matter of seconds. But that should not piss you off. You endure, you learn, you treat your opponent with respect.
---
LOL
---
It's Player Owned Starbases actually and structures are a separate thing

JuST MOVe To nuLLsec

Something to consider in Eve is that it's almost never a fair fight. If you join a corp in game that has support for you, while you are out mining or ratting you could call for backup when you get attacked. I'm not sure how ED works but in Eve you can light a cyno field and others can warp directly to that field, so it can be risky for pvpers to attack you. Also you could have cloaked stuff right there and there's no way for you to detect them unless you bump into them. There are also different areas of space where you have a local chat so you know when someone might be coming to kill you, and areas where you don't. Also there's scanning mechanics and warping to safe spots in space you make ahead of time.
---
There are lots of layers. I respect your decision to stick to ED I just wanted to lay out some differences.
---
It would still be better to refer to it as a structure as we are not sure if it is a citadel or an engineering complex
---
it's not terrible tbh, good rolls cost a lot to get so it's by no means required to go all red to compete.
---
overall i still feel the whole thing is somewhat out of place but fwiw there's another layer of "hmm what if i do this" to fitting choices. even then, a lot of fits that rely on mutaplasmids are too bottlenecked by supply and effort to browse through contracts.
---
also 1 isk zkillboard value for that dank isk efficiency amirite
---
Why would you willingly stay in highsec, the shittest of all space
---
I like it pretty dope all three of them so far. i see three so obviously you have to have the Minmitar one coming :)  
---
all of the art is well done.  
---
do you do computer art for others ?
---
Always coming soon, never having come.

Thats alot of mooolahs

---
I tried running the exe directly and while it did start the game and present a login screen, upon logging in, I get a popup that says I need to login via the launcher and the game closes.
---
I'm not familiar with alternate launchers, but I'll look into that, thanks.
---
when i start streaming in august again i will start releasing them busy with life work summer atm have small amounts of time.
---
after family Excreta when i can i sneak in some art and edit time
---
Forcing yourself to live out of highsec, with the limitations on income that it has, can be a challenge in and of itself, especially for an industrial player. I'd look at delonewolf on YouTube as an example of someone who does industrial work out of highsec and seems to do quite well for himself.
---
I mean.  Theyre killable with a single bomb, move 100 m/s, and CCP gave them killmails to encourage frigates to show how fucking easy pvp is by killing them.  
---
Highest youll ever see though

so, why was it called a spree....
---
No one tell him. XD
---
Cheers fixed it
---
Derp, Guess I fooled myself.
---
So true
---
I made that mistake my first time ever going into a wormhole, it took me 2-3 hours to finally get out, I never forgot to bookmark after that though so I guess I learned something.
---
Azbel&gt;Fortizar but the Fort will still "do the job".
---
The blurb was "build your castle, knock over theirs" or similar, they made things to promote industry in null, then salt when we actually built a castle and worked together. Punishing ppl with random changes isnt good design, lowsec was supposed to be the lawless region yet pvpers cried about lack of content, lowsec to hard?
---
Not gonna happen without tapi
---
Its definitely not wow, but it definitely is not a flight sim either. 
---
Elite and Eve have very little common really, other than being set in space
---
i hope so too but you’re putting a lot of faith into ccp/our korean overlords
---
I put more faith in the community's willingness to riot if it turns out some people randomly get more rewards from the event than others.         
---
u/CCP_Falcon, don't fuck this up.

Just some custom computer art series i have been working on for eve online.

Hope you all Enjoy just good old eve art as i personally find eve online beautiful.

The man on the right is the gallente leader if you ever wondered what he looked like

will be more active in august life calls atm o7
---
was a great little brawl. shooting in each direction. very target rich environment. would do again. gf
---
Nobody cares if you anchor an athanor, it s if you unanchor it that someone could show up to loot it.
---
Because you skill every day!!!
---
can I bring my dread?
---
Yeah, I just downloaded it after another guy was friendly and said "can't knock it til you try it" and I'm like "you're right, it's free." Turns out that's Eve is not a flight sim and I thought it was. I've got two flight sticks and everything.
---
In elite dangerous it would take another player a minute or two to jump in to help you and by then the fight is over unless it's 2 ships in an arraged duel with specialized loadouts, so human player's won't be able to stop a gank in progress. There is system police that comes in 10 - 60 seconds after the first shot, but they're laughable to any player who's in a ship meant for combat. Elite dangerous is *much* worse in this regard.
---
After looking at the other competitor in space flight sim games, it seems like even though elite dangerous sucks in many ways, it's the best that's out there.
---
i mean latter on they had manged to take stations off ore and hold them in till a large  mercenary faction **~ the  mordu's legion ~** assaulted them.
---
if i remember right the soltueur was at a shipyard getting some refitting and maintenance  done when it was boarded and taken over.
---
Yeah, I had a huge misunderstanding of what eve is. Granted, I *may* still get into it, but it's not the replacement for the pile of crap Frontier claims is a game. I took a intro game design elective class last semester, and they do all the things the intro class says *not* to do, lol.
---
Is it me or have they been giving out more than usual lately?
---
Smile you're on OHHHHHH MY GOD WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT.
---
Ingesting Spod in a powder form has the same effect at a much better price.
---
POS = Player Owned Starbase, and refers to a racial control tower and its mods.
---
Upwell structure = the replacements (citadel, engineering complex, refinery, FLEX), but many of us just call them citadels.
---
I was the cyno sabre, was a good brawl did not expect you guys to bring it like that at all
---
Yeah, but it's much more impactful to new players and new alts. When was the last time you waited on a rigging skill to be able to fly your new retribution or something?
---
Welcome to Eve Online. People will shoot you for no reason whatsoever besides "Because I can." Perhaps you were traveling in a low-security system (security status 0.1-0.4) and warped into (or jumped) into a gatecamp.
---
A) Are Zealots still feasible for fleet operations? Are pulses better or do they still need to be beam?
---
B) Are T3D fleets as common as they were back at release?
---
They'll still be used as they massively improve the performance of nearby barges, but you'll just see 1-2 per belt max, and they won't be 3b - they'll be closer to 1.5b and with tank rigs.
---
I mean have you ever compared the boosts an orca or porpoise gives to the boosts a Rorqual gives in siege? 3 Mindlinked Orca boosted hulks mine about as much as 2 Mindlinked Rorqual boosted Hulks. Depending on the scale of your operation it is almost certainly worthwhile to risk a 3b rorqual (that can make all of your barges invulnerable for 7mins) for a 50% increase in mining yield, it will pay itself back very quickly.
---
Praaaiisseee James XD
---
Don't think about it. Don't think about it.
---
I'd you want to go the kitey sort of scumbag route for cheap, can't really do better than a Tristan or Navy Slicer. 
---
If you want to brawl it out like it's six years ago...then just go straight for the Hyperion with grappler and web and watch everything be too scared to come within 10k of you.
---
They literally aren't worth using.  All of the tards saying "LOL THEY NEED RISK" need to return to licking windows.  "Risk" shouldn't mean the only winning move is not to play.  With even half competent bombers in blackout, you'd make more mining in high sec in a Procurer once you factor in excavator losses.  You'd have to be brain dead to use them with those odds.
---
Yep, at the end, one dude could get like 300k SP while one gets 1.5m from doing the exact same thing.  Whatever this special dev team is smoking, I need 2 of them, because it feels like they run every decision through a "how can I make this more retarded" filter these days.
---
Goons have been pretty vocal against things that are barely an inconvenience to them but a problem to others.
---
Not fun to be the only one with proper industry
---
don't forget the fuel for the the core ;)
---
They can't even get these events working properly (already plenty of reports for people not even getting the SP for completing the challenges), are you really naive enough to think they have it dynamically planned out with to make sure everyone gets the same total from the daily RNG?
---
Carrier ratting gives my digital eye strain most of the time after 2 hours, i can't focus properly after that. Too much clicking, sorting sigs, aligning, etc. Rorq mining is too boring on the other side, unless you multibox (which i don't) . Rorq mining is not boring if you are on comms with other guys and you are all doing the same stuff, joking, discussing, etc so times passes differently. But soloing is brain death.
---
Oof
---
Like in old times?

Just some custom computer art series i have been working on for eve online.

i don't have any eve friends and I hate major null corps to the core of my being. i might join a small corp but I will probably just go solo

This is truly awful

I observed this kill as it went down, OP, weren't you on auto pilot?
---
What are you an edgelord? Unfunny dumbass with an iq of -10 haha
---
How does that add anything to the conversation?
---
&gt;In sov nullsec anyone can enter system using gates that you don't control.
---
In wormholes anyone can connect to you at any time.
---
&gt;Majority of PVE spots is predefined and visible to all with ability to instantly warp in.
---
More anomalies and instantly respawning anomalies mean that it's easier to hide. In fact, null systems with more PvE in them have more sites, unlike wormholes, so a hunter has to warp around and scan from multiple locations or use combat probes which can be seen on d-scan. Combined with cloaked scouts on gates it's in practice no safer in wormholes than in sov null.
---
&gt;You can get unlimited enemy forces coming by a cyno, quite often from separate region.
---
You can get unlimited allied forces coming by a cyno, quite often from a separate region.
---
&gt;At the same time the **carebear** holes let you control who and in what force can come in. You can close all the doors and shut down all the windows.
---
And people can still connect to you, completely randomly. You still have to be vigilant and keep on top of new signatures, just like in null where you have to keep on top of new gate flashes.
---
&gt;**Come and live in Stain!**
---
Keep being salty. I love this salt. It sustains me. The salt must flow.

He says he forgot to refit in local

Yes, but even after that he didn't need to die

I wonder why didn't the Hecate engage was it his alt and he fucked up multiboxing
---
BUT ITS A DEFENSELESS MINER OMG IT CANT POSSIBLY WIN AGAINST A TECH THREE CRUISER MEANT FOR GANKING
---
Too soon?
---
There are so many open questions here which may forever go unanswered
---
All of the devs that were around for that piece of history got better jobs or got fired, so it makes sense that they'd forget how much of a failure it was last time.
---
Errr yea I errrm mean we had a errr good fight in esoteria.
---
&gt;In wormholes anyone can connect to you at any time.                   
---
In nullsec you are **connected all the time**, you get no warning if someone enters your system by gate or covert cyno in the same way like new signature showing up on your scanner in WH space.              
---

---
When comparing WH space population to current nullsec population you can much more easily find someone in nullsec.            
---
**Above this CCP provided ESI telling you when and where you can find someone** ^(aka stats about npc kills showing system and TZ when someone is active)                   
---
&gt;You can get unlimited allied forces coming by a cyno, quite often from a separate region.

Same for enemies, this can be escalated by both sides.       
---
&gt;And people can still connect to you, completely randomly. You still have to be vigilant and keep on top of new signatures, just like in null where you have to keep on top of new gate flashes.                     
---
**You have proved my point** as wh space can control entry points and see signatures. While in nullsec it is not possible. Someone can be even logged out on spot , login and light the cyno **AFTER** he have tackled you.                     
---
&gt;Keep being salty. I love this salt. It sustains me. The salt must flow.               
---
I am not salty. It is simply funny that WH became the **carebears** of the nullsec New Eden.                 
---
You know that WH space is considered also 0.0 right?
---
&gt;https://github.com/KryptedGaming/pathfinder-docker
---
use traefik instead of nginx, it listens on docker API port and automatically creates a load balancer if you deploy more than 1 instance. It's really neat to scale it if needed, just add another node, and traefik will automatically put it in the LB pool . And it has a nice interface also with stats and all that, graphs, etc
---
Well for Alphas you reduce it naturally. Other events give less SP to Alphas, why is this one different?
---
10k to Alphas daily = 280k for the duration of the event. Is this too much also?
---
I'd even give them 25k pre day.. because why the hell not.
---
How do you clean your clothes out there?
---
[https://youtu.be/AGBA3MM1i4U](https://youtu.be/AGBA3MM1i4U)  
---
Fight from our side :P
---
Well at least there would be some resistance compared to absolutely no resistance with just 3 subs. But yeah if somebody wants it dead it's going to be dead.
---
Didn't this get posted yesterday?
---
Easily abused by having an Alpha alt that hasn't logged in, then Delivering stuff to it. 
---
But then you could put in a special rule saying that 'stuff touched by another account in the past 90 days drops anyway'. So now you have three rules: 
---
1. Asset Safety only available on Alpha accounts. 
---
2. Asset Safety only activates on accounts not logged in for +90 days. 
---
3. Asset Safety only activates on assets Delivered to an account in the past 90 days.
---
Having all these special rules is un-intuitive, hard to communicate to the player, and hard for developers to maintain. Might be easier for everyone to accept that Asset Safety is bad, but every variation on it is worse.
---
that feeling of "holy fuck I fucked up" when you use your brand new cruiser and get lost in a wormhole.
---
I use whatever words I want and there’s nothing you can do stop me, old man.
---
This is known, like half of the buyout value was linked to metrics.  We just don't know the timeframe or what metrics, but judging by the full-inflation they've been going lately, I'd guess it's soon.
---
pls stop
---
Its not like this is anything new.  CCP is pretty much the definition of skewing metrics to favor an agenda.  Hello CCP\_360MTicks.
---
No ihub upgrades in w-space. When you run your sites in a C5 they are gone. Wait 2 weeks for more.
---
Not under any current mechanics
---
The only things that need to be done with wardecs is counting failing to pay the bill and lettin the wardec drop as the same as directly calling the war off and put it on a long cooldown.
---
From there they just need to make it so that once the war hq is reinforced you can't call off the war until its dead or you successfully defend the reinforcement timer. If you fail to pay the bill in attempt to drop the wardec because of the above change its counted as forfeiting the war.
---
yes, you can do plexes in amarr-minmatar-warzone as a caldari-FW-pilot.  
---
no, you can not shoot at a minmatar-IHub when the system is vulnerable. you can't even target lock it.
---
you'll only get state protectorate LP's, no matter where you doing plexes. no amarr lp's for you. For amarr (gallente, minmatar) LP's you have to switch to the militia in question.
---
You guys are p well set up in Tribute to get fights out of Pure Blind duders (French Connexion, Banderlogs, C0NE, F1SSI0N) and Tribute dudes (Rote, Unspoken). Hopefully some new fresh blood moves into eastern Tribute and some weird content area shows up.
---
Why does the clip skip to the end at the exact moment the Proteus dies?
---
Hot drop o’clock would give them heart attacks, and let’s not even get started on their build times.
---
Knew someone would post this. (I would have if you hadn't)
---
In other news: RIP Rutger Hauer
---
I'm ratting more than ever in Null. Please disregard my Cyno module. I'm just a harmless krab.
---
No, really.
---
Totally not bait.
---
There’s a difference between what sounded like a semi-legitimate hostile takeover of a rival company through buying a majority in their stock and sneaking tens of thousands of highly-trained crew into what was likely the one of the top ten most heavily guarded military installations in all of New Eden. The former sounds plausible to me, the latter not so much.
---
Nice. I miss the old Eve artwork. They had a nice cyberpunk feel.
---
Say Apple.
---
- Use some old models from dust , make a low spec rts minigame .. conquer planets for resources instead of bashing another structure.
---
- Use SOV indexes for bonus to defenders/ attackers
---
- Recources extracted based on land conquered 
---
Change my mind or upvote #ccplease

Haha. Like we give a fuck.

Pretty sure I learned fitting from mimicking. Its how humans learn walking and talking, no doubts it works.
---
Dude ty for sharing. Killed a viator today and got a vni to 75% armor - sadly it was a pvp vni :)
---
Everyone is in goons now lol
---
Teaching by example.
---
yeah true, just did a quick look up on it and it seems to say it was ambushed back then the empires did not think there was much off a risk to them so it mite off been lightly guarded.
---
CCP really need to do something like this imo.
---
I imagine in an alternate universe dust 514, eve online and Valkyrie were all handled properly and are making the eve verse one of the most ambitious and successful franchise in history.
---
Its curated.
---
Incompetence and assumption of inviolability explains so many things.
---
10/10
---
Thats what i was thinking !
---
so they are gone for good now ?
---
Thats what i was thinking!
---
True.
---
you just won r/eve today!
---
&gt;In nullsec you are **connected all the time**, you get no warning if someone enters your system by gate or covert cyno in the same way like new signature showing up on your scanner in WH space.
---
You know exactly who your neighbours are at any time and can be reasonably certain of when they're online or not. Your chance of getting dropped on by random roamers, especially deep in large null blocs, is pretty low.
---
&gt;When comparing WH space population to current nullsec population you can much more easily find someone in nullsec.
---
So your chance of finding *someone* is higher because there's more people. You do know that doesn't mean it's mechanically more difficult in null, right? If you have more people out krabbing then of course you're going to find more people, that doesn't mean that each individual person is any easier to find.
---
&gt;**Above this CCP provided ESI telling you when and where you can find someone**
---
No, the ESI shows you, with interpretation, where it's likely to find people. That doesn't tell you who is there or what they're flying. It provides no guarantees. It is abstract data that needs to be interpreted and it is nowhere near perfect intel.
---
&gt;Same for enemies, this can be escalated by both sides.  
---
You cannot be dropped by 200 bombers or 50 dreads in WH space ... carebear.
---
No, but I don't have access to a dozen supers to instantly win any engagement. Even with a home-turf advantage (which I won't usually have since krabbing activity rarely happens in home and usually happens in a static) it's still eminently possible for an attacker to, with planning, field enough forces to defeat my allies. And, again, most fights don't happen in home because home holes rarely have any sites in them, so krabbers rarely have any home turf advantage.
---
&gt;**You have proved my point** as wh space can control entry points and see signatures.
---
Wormholers can't control entry points any more effectively than nullsexers because, again, people can just connect to you randomly with only a few seconds' warning. Combat probing down a ratter takes under half a minute and warping fast tackle to them takes a few seconds, more than enough time to catch out a capital or even some battleships.
---
&gt;Someone can be even logged out on spot , login and light the cyno **AFTER** he have tackled you.
---
And you can light a cyno and instantly drop a dozen supers and twice that many capitals and instantly win any engagement. 
---
&gt;It is simply funny that WH became the **carebears** of the nullsec New Eden.
---
That never happened. But enjoy your fantasies.
---
The public hosted version slow, especially on weekends.
---
When you host it yourself, you can also add stuff to the code that fits your needs. For example we have region names on k-space systems:  [https://puu.sh/CUXtB/0dbfda0937.png](https://puu.sh/CUXtB/0dbfda0937.png) 
---
Another corp has automated WH aliaes, good for BMs names.
---
It might also be more secure, as you have control over code and server.
---
It was edge of EUTZ and provi numbers are meh atm. Was a good brawl regardless, the dread trade was fairly one sided due to us mainly being revs and you guys with moros/nags, though ofc that changed once the supers/titans jumped in as we were finishing the last dread on grid.
---
   
---
And yeah there were a few dudes asking about batphones which is why both equi and I told them there is no one coming to save us, and there is literally no point in calling anyone anyway.
---
I don't think he knows how a washing machine works.
---
No cynos in w-space. Mass limits on wormholes mean you can't bring more than three caps to a fight in a static, which is where 90% of all fights happen. 
---
But he doesn't live in wormholes, never has, and never will, so I don't see how he'd know this.
---
Can you please tell everyone your corp, i really want to wardec you now
---
Yeah considering  what has happened after all off this, the titans  been barely reported on beside them ramping up security  around them, last i remember was the Gallente saying they had  6 off there super titans  and there fleets on stand by for the  raid on Luminaire.   
---
so after all this happened there probably all be moved deep into military complex's and placed under heavy guard.
---
Yeh, we fight with banders and fxr alot.
---
Maybe if we yell loud enough they'll listen to us :p
---
Best idea ever - DONT GAME ON A MAC
---
Yes there are. They might have an understanding with Large blocs but that doesn't make them not independent.
---
But its been like this forever. With the old stations nothing dropped so this cant be used as an argument for keeping the core alive. 
---
Other than that, it would be a clusterfuck of epic proportions if that happened. But you know what, Im fine with it. Remove all NPC stations from NPC Null and lowsec while youre at it. So others might feel that they are living in a harsh and dangerous universe as well.
---
Im scared!! Porpoise too stronk, plz nerf!!!
---
Yeah I'm seeing bunch of my ex Alliance / Corpmates in GSF corps now.
---
AAR from Provi side:
---
I was chilling on comms when apparently a rorq got tackled with supers on grid, so I got peopled into some machs with triage and a few HICs (aside from the Hels there were only a small group of BS's).
---
Cyno jammer was up on grid so I told cyno dude to just bring us in at a ping and we'll go from there. Bridged in, 1 hel warped to a safe and 1 warped to an Astra, sorta just said fuck the rorqual lets go balls deep on the Hel.
---
Landed on Astrahus with the hel, brought in everything we had at the time (Think it was around 10 or so dreads), got it to low shield before 2-3 shield fax jumped, alongside about 8 Apostles (??) throughout the fight.
---
    
---
We start pinging for more dreads, as I assume they did aswell, we were trading quite well due to being all in revs, against much lighter tanked nags/moros. The dread brawl went on for 10 Minutes or so, we were just finishing off the last dread and about to kill the first triage when another cyno was lit and RC started dumping supers/titans onto grid.
---
Gave the call for subcaps to evac, told caps if they could get out, get out, otherwise continue going for FAXs just to kill as much as possible.
---
___
---
Was a GF, gave RC a bloody nose despite losing the engagement and everyone had a good time. Weren't really sure how it would turn out due to this being on the edge of EUTZ (Provi numbers dip off hard going into USTZ) and recent activity being a bit low.
---
Hats off to RC for providing the fight.
---
I saw CNC, I vpuote
---
I also love this fact. You can bait people again and no one see those 2 cloaked hictor alts sitting 0.3 AU from you.        
---
**Truly dangerous space**
---
Its a fact, get over it.              
---
The funny part is that you also know it is true.
---
Damn those fits hurt my eyes. People need some more training me guesses. Keep shooting them please, only way they will learn.
---
Why would we escalate past caps when it's edge of our timezone and we haven't already got supers/titans setup, this fight was spur of the moment and all went down in a matter of seconds, with our numbers being relatively low as it is lately, dropping in whatever supers/titans (if we had any) at the time would have been suicide.
---
No one is talking here about effectiveness of WH ratting.     
---
**I totally agree** that you can make less if you can/want rat 23/7... but more if you do it in bursts.                  
---
It is about how **safe space is you do the PVE**            
---
WH became the **carebear heaven** at this point.
---
Youre funny!
---
lol, please let this be all true.
---
Yeah I started to do that again after blackout. Great change btw. But it's still not the same, only 20k people logged in instead of 40k :/
---
Bud i am loyal servant of our beloved Lord Sansha Kuvakei        
---
One of his many titles is "Saviour of Anoikis"              
---
While capsulers think they 'own' the WH space when it is The Nation that opens the doors for their use, and capsuleers just use the connections.                
---
The only Nation that owns the WH generators is Sansha Nation.       
---
True Nation!
---
No it means you have options.
---
And from gameplay prespective, its make sense, you can be safer but get lesser reward, or you can risk more to get more.
---
This is now better balanced. And if the risk remains the same and people stop using excavators, you could make decent argument about buffing their yield again.
---
But the max yield option (ie. minding end game) definitively should be both expensive and risky.
---
Hi, great ideas Falcon. Stop droping Titan on a Caracal Fleet ( low sec )
---
You have entered system M-404.
---
Ok.
---
So you want CCP to balance an RTS now, huh?
---
i mean look at roqual killbord, most of them are not from delve, even tho delve mines more than the rest of eve https://zkillboard.com/ship/28352/losses/
---
It was a legit question about your opinion of the game you've found upon return.
---
Man, explaining is indeed no fun.
---
I would like to see the word “FUN” rather then the word “balance”  these days..  cus i see that more then enough
---
Being aligned in a carrier with a cyno is definitely more dangerous than being sieged for 5-20 minutes in a wormhole in an anom with piles of tackle.
---
The fact that most of the community made "fitting channels" are full of shitfits, I don't hold out much hope for this nonsense.
---
Well, the way you worded it made it seem hostile. I'm sorry.
---
And no I moved all my stuff to hs a while before I quit and had a few hundred bil liquid isk ready for my return. (Quit in 2015-16)
---
As an RC line member, I think this is a simple misunderstanding, you seem to be mistaking the multiple smaller PvP alliances that make up our number as 'Batphones'
---
It'd be like me saying that CVA has to Batphone Severance all the time to bail it out, hope this clears things up!
---
*P.S. How do you bait in a Rorq during blackout when you're unsubbed in protest of said blackout?*
---
Having a NIP with the local big bloc does not make them independent. It makes their existence/holding that sov dependent on that NIP, ergo, not independent.
---
I know 50% of people have fun in an unbalanced 1v1, but i'd rather have that a bit higher than that.
---
its kind of true. there's ups and downs to both null and wh pve right now. if anything, blackout has balanced it out.
---
My Astero and Strat have never had baths, really dirty stock paint job looks best.
---
Meh, you need to trim the dead wood to let the tree grow. Give it time, keep generating content, and in a decade hopefully EVE will be better than ever.
---
Welcome to eve...
---
Someone played unanchor chicken
---
and lost
---
good
---
&gt; You know exactly who your neighbours are at any time and can be reasonably certain of when they're online or not. Your chance of getting dropped on by random roamers, especially deep in large null blocs, is pretty low.             
---
In K space all players are your nehighbours. There is no limit who and when will visit you.       
---
In WH space you close the door if you don't like your neighbours.  
---
&gt;So your chance of finding someone is higher because there's more people. You do know that doesn't mean it's mechanically more difficult in null, right? If you have more people out krabbing then of course you're going to find more people, that doesn't mean that each individual person is any easier to find.         
---
Have you heard about dotlan?         
---
If you don't have your own dedicated tools you can check **WHERE AND WHEN IS SOMEONE ACTIVE** by checking the history.     
---
Single look at out of game tool show you where PVE activity is happening.                
---
&gt;No, the ESI shows you, with interpretation, where it's likely to find people. That doesn't tell you who is there or what they're flying. It provides no guarantees. It is abstract data that needs to be interpreted and it is nowhere near perfect intel.                
---
No it is not abstract data, while it is not a perfect intell if you gather the data from ESI and  see that some systems were active for last 2 months at 14:00 EVE ... you can safely assume that someone is there, especially that with slight delay you can see if someone is active today.        
---
&gt;No, but I don't have access to a dozen supers to instantly win any engagement. Even with a home-turf advantage (which I won't usually have since krabbing activity rarely happens in home and usually happens in a static) it's still eminently possible for an attacker to, with planning, field enough forces to defeat my allies. And, again, most fights don't happen in home because home holes rarely have any sites in them, so krabbers rarely have any home turf advantage.                  
---
This depends how much you want to escalate and how **skill full you are**        
---
In WH space entrance determines what can enter, and if needed you can suicide butt-plug-it in panic.              
---
&gt;Wormholers can't control entry points any more effectively than nullsexers because, again, people can just connect to you randomly with only a few seconds' warning. Combat probing down a ratter takes under half a minute and warping fast tackle to them takes a few seconds, more than enough time to catch out a capital or even some battleships.                      
---
1. Wormholers can control all current entry points.         
---
2. If a wormholer bot see signature he can react, the nullsecer player is instantly pointed by a bomber that lights a cyno.         
---
3. If combat probing a takes you 30s, consider doing first some dscans pinpointing area where someone is, when you have it at 5% and it is not anomaly then drop combat probes and have this person in 1 scan cycle.  **Lack of Skill is not an excuse**    
---
&gt;And you can light a cyno and instantly drop a dozen supers and twice that many capitals and instantly win any engagement.                
---
Counter drop him, or don't be dumb. Sacrificing a bait bomber to have enemy fleet on a jump timer let you abuse someone in another system or just if you are **smart and have the skill** split enemy fleet as they are warping off.  Giving you enough time to drop in dreads in dreads and kill a high value target while he is stranded and other people unable to act.             
---
Lack of skill, knowledge and planing are well known traits of carebears.         
---
You are wormhole - carebear right?           
---
At least it looks like it.
---
And?
---
I'd honestly just nuke my colonies and not bother.
---
This is, of course, assuming everyone lives in highclass jspace.
---
Well don't fly ships you cannot afford to lose.         
---
Like you can use NSA on your (super)carrier and be locked in space ... or use rattles in WH space.         
---
Like people also dread rat in K space, and do stuff like boson ratting in a titan.           
---
Your call how you want to do it.                
---
The same rules apply to all places.        
---
^(and don't tell me that WH ratting in dread is more dangerous than doing the same in K space)
---
The whole point of PANIC is to create content. The hunter attacks and a timer starts where the attacked party has a chance to respond and a battle ensues.
---
What you're asking for is just a gank.
---
I'm a rorqual owner. i like your idea. 
---
I'm not sure those who talk about nerfing the rorqual yield ever had a rorqual, and even tried to pilot one in sisi. 
---
It's not safe. It requires lot of organisation from pilots (except delve idiots that skipped the evolution / learning process. No offense tho)
---
they shouldnt be easy to multibox. But hey, i'm paying real money for my sub, it's a win for CCP if people can multibox easily &amp; pay real money for it :)
---
You cannot balance ability to jump stuff from another region.     
---
Thus nullsec is more dangerous ;)
---
Rorqs are only 10b with the excavators factorered in, less than 5 without.
---
Well yes, but also applies to all WH spaces, while C4 have more connections you can close or crit them all.            
---
Still nothing beats the WH mechanics that let you farm final bosses using structures.
---
I'm pretty sure you're wrong. 1 Rorq + 2 Hulks mines more than 3 Rorqs according to people I trust in the "field".
---
You might be right if you remove the boost though.
---
i dont like code, but fuck thats one shitty prot pilot  
---
good kill
---
Keep your shit fueled and full power and the chances of you getting evicted are slim tbh
---
Bad question, why i cannot just nuke someone else colonies from the orbit ?
---
[removed]
---
&gt;The botting problem could be solved by any competent anti cheat too.
---
The botting problem could be fixed by CCP checking their metrics once a week and banning everyone online *and active* 20 hours every damn day. Note : cloaky afkers are not active :p
---
well who would've thought that after you killed off content everywhere else, that people starting knocking on your door.
---
Being new does not matter. The trick would be to try and not make yourself a target for eviction which this guy did by streaming it. Wingspan is only kinda a wormhole corp anyway because they don't actually live in wh's but just go around cloaky so they are not really representative of people who actively live in a single wormhole.
---
Oh and Anton was a fuckkn moron that stole everything from his previous Corp and fucked over his friends.  He admitted it on stream and also to me on Reddit. 
---
He deserved everything g he got and I hope he gets evicted from every hole till the end of time for being a shitty human
---
lol go to highsec. or WOw classic.
---
Who closes all their connections in their static? that's a painful existence. My corp closes some of the holes and then just puts cloaky alts watching the holes that have been left there.
---
nice. balanced =)
---
What are you on about? In another post you say you don't want a fight! Or is a fight ok but just not against a proper defence?
---
MY MAGNATE WAS FITTED WITH THE FOLLOWING:
---
I think its once per day coinciding with downtime, correct me if wrong :)
---
go have a read: [https://www.eveonline.com/article/skill-trading-in-new-eden](https://www.eveonline.com/article/skill-trading-in-new-eden)
---
moving goal posts? this sounds like a beaten wife making excuses for her abusive husband :D
---
They won't fit in my fitting list, it's full already.
---
oh i forgot that tackled ships cant light a cyno and have a hammer come down on the aggressor due to blackout.
---
I wouldn't mind if CCP removed cynos from k-space. To make it safer for krabs, obviously!
---
booster are okay since you train them on a character before. no promise broken their. directly selling SP for cash? yeeah fuck you CCP, i don't believe any word you say anymore
---
Fuck you fucktard
---
Its talks
---
Well if you want you have the option, if somethings go bad you still can do it.
---
You go to hs fascist
---
You fishing?
---
why you think some one has more than 2 accounts is bot?? fucktard
---
No chinese here... your are rasist
---
Well it is a dangerous space after all.         
---
TBH, it is the problem with the new generation of eve players.          
---
They see the carrier ... and try to kill it.            
---
In the old days you bubbled the carrier and farmed those who came to save him until you could not maintain the reps and then just warped off ... just to come back to tackle the stragglers.
---
you move out, fucking fucktard
---
its all true, read this thread you know how write negative replays
---
I'd have to make way too many assumptions about how this "RTS Game" would work in order to give an answer to that question.
---
You move to hs, ns get more safer then
---
get a asprine
---
you dont know much do you, who build ships and stuff to blow up? think again IF you can
---
I AM NOT ALONE... fucktard
---
your bot, reported...
---
Issue was with us is we tried to take new guys into wh to try and teach them about pvp with a training class approach. How to bubble, boosh, manual pilot and also just basic pvp stuff they will need when living in a wh but because it was new guys this created content for wingspan and so we got camped in.
---
[screen shot of him admitting everything ](https://imgur.com/a/dQeomZq)
---
ok, then go thier...
---
In that case all of WH-space would go full on Deep Space Nine and mine their static every time they need hole control. Would be, hmmmm... interesting.
---
Sometimes when you talk I just want to self destruct
---
Honestly, WiNGSPAN only dose evictions if  the people we are evicting have both made themselves a target and given us a good reason to. They are tedious to to right, and we have a policy to avoid evictions in general. The particular case mentioned here was a result of an attempted stream snipe, that escalated to us bashing a low power structure with a couple of guys in an attempt to get content. Afterwards his general attitude towards the hole thing, coupled with several particular comments such as his admitting to stealing everything from his old corp because he could (that was the reason he gave, no story of corp drama, just a whelp, they gave me access so I might as well take everything and leave), are what drove our decision fully evict him. The structure was unfit, and we were fairly certain there wasn't going to be significant loot in it. If the structure wasn't low power, we might not have even come back for the second timer. If it was fit, he probably could have even forced off the first bash, it's not as if WiNGSPAN roams with logi. If he hadn't been streaming the entire process, we both wouldn't have found him, and wouldn't have had any justification for an eviction. With the exception of low power structures (we need to pay for SRP somehow), our policy is to bash as little as possible; more people in j-space means more content for us.
---
Maybe, but I get my opinion out thats all. Your a joke yourself.. HAHAHAAHHAAAA
---
go fuck yourself, thank you
---
yes, but how many has done that already
---
What an ass
---
Your bot
---
Your one of them afk camper?
---
FUCKING GANKER
---
I'd love to see CCP release the figures. Many folks have said they're going to unsub but many have also said they're going to resub ... Be interesting to set the net result.
---
?!?!
---
what??
---
Getting camped in is one thing and getting evicted is another.   Unless your hole is in VERY high demand, your structures are low power, or you have insane assets in the hole... you won’t be evicted by WDS
---
So another corp has people sitting in your hole camping for kills. Seems like a normal day. Just bait them and pod em out ez pz. If you cant deal with people camping your system then your gonna be running into some issues.
---
ما الذي تتحدث عنه ؟
---
When was the last time you did any sort of roaming pvp?
---
PL sucks... I dont...
---
We conquered some region in tenerifis and we fight with chinese
---
leave ns
---
your even more funnier
---
I dont fuck you, so here is one
---
Its no threat its a promise, fucktard
---
your born fake
---
Ok and what about the fact that we have to roll our static to find pve? Countless times we have rolled into another groups home hole and fought them. Doing pve through the static is a blend of pvp and pve as if we find another group to fight were going to fight them and if we find sites we krab them.
---
ROFL
---
You see fishing ??
---
Totally agree. We could not kill them so we did not deserve to hold the hole.
---
I think alone he prolly killed 1.6T and stole way more.  :)
---
Your so dumb
---
&gt; In the old days you bubbled the carrier and farmed those who came to save him until you could not maintain the reps and then just warped off ... just to come back to tackle the stragglers.
---
If you do this now those who come to save him are typically supers, titans and FAX, so there's no point in waiting for a response. 
---
This meta has built a lot of resentment on both sides. PVPers feel shafted because a supercap umbrella is not fightable for the vast majority of them, PVEers feel shafted because PVPers seem to be just looking for quick ganks now. A lot of the groups that would tackle and wait for a response either quit the game or moved on to other activities.
---
when did he say that he couldn't afford to lose it
---
He deleted all his reddit posts, but I saved them all just for occasions like this.
---
I just hope that when observatories are here and all new mechanics are introduced, local will stay in NPC null - just like stations did when Upwell-exclusive sov null became reality
---
Yes, because not knowing who can jump into your system at any point is so much safer than having 2+ regions of meatshield intel and 200+ titans ready to save you if someone gets through
---
**FANTASTIC!** Not only idiots read my post. This is very good explained! Exact what thinks to. I wrote my post on eve communite it been block, because I write negative about the game, have happend before thou.
---
HTFU ??
---
Just make pi a phone game. Make me log in to install the command center sure, but everything else should be snap to grid placed so I can shit out coolant or whatever while I shit out the opposite of coolant or whatever.
---
\&gt; ccontains database user information   
---
Why was this installation specific information within the repo in the first place?
---
you go back to hs, you fascist
---
Well, dont read it then
---
You go thier yourself
---
What?? You see me fishing??
---
bye who ?
---
Well we could not deffend it. We did not have any expensive stuff in. We where camped in because we where new to wh so our fits where not optimal and whatever we did we had someone in corp that could read our discord msg and corp mails and still can. We mentioned that we cant hold or deffend against their t3cs and so we going to pull out. The next day there where 3 wingspan pilots camping our high sec trying to catch people pulling out ships.
---
No Im not gay like you, sorry....
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77453460/ at least part of it
---
Well you can anchor athanors on all your moons and mine belts spawned by them.      
---
Like you choose space where you live.
---
Plenty of beach front property for crabs to crab in WH.   BOB loves crab
---
Are you threatens me in anyway??
---
Adding troop transport modules or even dedicated ships with a special bay and infrantry fights for planet control would be amazing. Load Marines in your ship, drop them on the planet and watch shit explode. Too bad it won't give CCP more money so I guess it'll never happen.
---
Before i became lazy.
---
Exactly
---
CODE is NRDS for all of high sec. So long as you have and follow the rules of a mining permit, they even actively defend you from reds.
---
It is very rare for us to camp a hole for more then a couple of days, and even then it is usually only 1-3 guys. If you are having a hard time chasing off a small cloaky cruiser gang, maybe you need to rethink how you are doing things. A bait drake or procurer out doing things is a cheap way to bait, and a neut geddon plus maybe a smaller tackle/DPS ship is very bad news for any active T3 you land tackle on. If you have the ISK, a bhal is even scarier. From what I've seen, people get camped in if they either feed without trying to organized any defense, or if they have well and truly made someone dislike you (such as the case in the video you linked).
---
So ages ago.
---
I’m confused. Let’s start at the beginning.....
---
Did they blow up your citadels ?  We’re your citadels fueled/full power
---
More or less.         
---
Now just killing the big stuff.
---
Actually Citizen Bob is allergic on the crabs. He prefers apples.
---
Gate red = Jump     
---
Burn Tacticals = Jump
---
So to ask another question seeing as i guess i will attract wh people here.
---
If someone wanted to move into a C1 then what structure should they place down as their first structure and what modules from a deffensive point should be on it.
---
change poco mechanics while at it
---
\- remove the one and only poco that can be dropped by players and be taxed
---
\- launchpads can launch stuff into orbit using a "drop pod" (easily scannable, hackable, even with low skill, punishment for low effort PI and agressive defense against divers/ninja PI) that can be launched for some fuel (none if empty and only one at a time) and will spawn in a random grid near the planet (like a tiny mission site with bookmark for the launching player) ...  (danger of abuse as quick safespot here)
---
\- "droppod" act as temporary (like 10-30 minutes, cancleable for immediate return) poco replacement and will return with their content back to the launchpad, enabling transfer both ways but for some additional cost, so batching is encouraged and spamming punished
---
\- upgrades for the launchpad depending on sov and conquerstatus, like longer pod time, better hack resistance, lower scan signature, better fuel efficiency, "tether upgrade"
---
\- allow a number of stationary pocos depending on resources available, system sov and conquer status on the planet
---
\- pocos spawn at DT whenever one meets the requirements and has a "tehter upgrade" installed in their launchpad and a poco slot is available, creating a backlog of offlined thether upgrades if too many
---
\- tethered pocos will stay where they are and appear in the system overview like the old one as a drawback but dont require any fuel for transfer to counter for that permanent location issue
---
\- not fullfilling requirements anymore will result in removal after DT (and spawning a new in place when there is backlog of offlined tether upgrades that now meet the reuirements)
---
\- those pocos can be offlined by shooting it into a short invul timer and finally be destroyed like mobile depot for content oppertunity but will respawn on DT 1 day after destruction as long as the reuirements are still met
---
\- in sov space some sort of license can be obtained through payment (low ammunt of LPs or Tags) to fullfill the sov requirement for the tether upgrade to online because here are no player sov mechanics available
---
poco taxing is BS and creates no content
---
having the dynamic grids will also mitigate poco camping and force people to a tad more effort in scanning and hacking for stealing or sniping
---
stationary pocos for sov owner will improve usability while highsec stays clean of stupid taxed pocos
---
and the licensing will allow for pocos in high sec and pirate null or even make that license a sellable item in sov space for alliance internal taxing
---
I hope CCP remove cynos and make that all stuff (including JF) jump to a system sun.
---
Had a athanor that was fueled.
---
That comment is a reply to the one above me.
---
/u/Jibrish 'doing' the controversial ;)
---
id love some Homeworld: Deserts of Karak style land carriers to roam around the desert looking for shipwrecks that deorbited after a fight on a poco
---
Remember dust's planetary bombardment system? id love to see that re-purposed for this
---
Did they blow the athanor up? Reinforce it? Or just camp you ?
---
[https://zkillboard.com/system/31000293/page/2/](https://zkillboard.com/system/31000293/page/2/)We never blew it up, they just unanchored it as far as I can tell.
---
Unless you're claiming NC. and Horde are part of RC, it seems the misunderstanding is on your end.
---
Perhaps with enough apples, BOB will provide shortcuts to LS from stain
---
wingspan is just a low effort meme as they have a reputation of picking the lowest hanging fruit
---
gsf have no interest in someone who only want to run missions
---
I do not think that blackout made any change there. 
---
The way cyno works and the way wormhole mass works as always meant wormhole is carebear paradise.
---
And the way NPC work is all about anyone can stage there  ... 
---
blackout just means that people can sneak around.
---
i want you to post your best content on your cakeday
---
Did you scoop it ;)
---
CODE is like the periodic forest fires that reinvigorate the soil so new shit can grow. Ganking encourages people to play around potential loss as a factor in their income whatever they do which eventually leads to the conclusion that you might as well go to low or null and make much more ISK for similar risk of losses. 
---
On the other hand if you get ganked and your conclusion is that the game isn't worth it if your ship dies ever then you belong in another game.
---
Personally I really don't get all the CODE hate given that it drives people to sustainable gameplay (it's unreasonable to play EVE on the premise that you never die) and it positively affects the profitability per hour of all high sec activities since no matter what on a large enough scale all losses during crabbing are paid by the buyer of said activity's product.
---
Well generators he manage let Sansha Nation to move supercarrier even to higsec ... but he don't let me play with his toys after the Seyllin Incident
---
An astrahus is ideal, though you can use a raitaru if you are going to be cheap. Generally the fit will look something like this:

By people who don't play their own game? Or, even worse, the ISD?
---
I mean people defiantly don’t rage roll C5’s and C6’s to find people ratting. That never happens
---
Oï !
---
I can’t speak for Zealots, as I’ve never really used them. However, I think Sacrileges have some use in fleet doctrines.
---
Concerning Tactical Destroyers, I do think they are still widely used. In wormholes they pack a serious punch for a small sized ship (even more if the battleground is in a Wolf Rayet system).
---
No, I checked, but it was never on the list.
---
How about we merge the idea with cynos and make the cyno drop ships within 10au.
---
Nah. For tragedies the math is 6 months for every year they were alive. So in her case, she was declared dead at the age of 41, Jan 15 1939. So after July 5, 1959 it was lolz valid.
---
&gt;C‘mon CCP, it takes less than a few minutes to make that gate spawn consistently.
---
I think you're *seriously* underestimating the amount of time and effort required in programming.
---
You got played playa
---
Yup. Definitely Chinese.
---
I gont get that part about sudden unanchor while rorq mining
---
How about we merge the idea of jumping to the sun and the current implementation of jumping at 0?
---
So basically shoot every ship into the Sun.
---
&gt;In K space all players are your nehighbours. There is no limit who and when will visit you.
---
This is so retarded I'm starting to believe Kuvakei just scooped out your brain and left you to rot.
---
&gt;This depends how much you want to escalate and how **skill full you are**  
---
In WH space entrance determines what can enter, and if needed you can suicide butt-plug-it in panic.
---
Wormhole fights **do not happen in home holes you absolute minger**.
---
90% of wormhole fights happen outside of home and when you get dropped it is nearly always outside your home, in your static connection.
---
&gt;If combat probing a takes you 30s, consider doing first some dscans pinpointing area where someone is, when you have it at 5% and it is not anomaly then drop combat probes and have this person in 1 scan cycle. **Lack of Skill is not an excuse**
---
You literally just proved my point. It isn't any easier to drop on people in nullsex than it is to drop on people in wormholes.
---

Hey folks, here's the [official thread](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/community-fittings/177903) for any feedback for this feature. The fittings are by no means perfect at this point, but we figured the best way to get them improved is getting more eyes on them.

Factorio in Multiplayer is fucking awesome. Minecraft too.
---
That "zoom" motion in and out matching the beat of the song is the most unnecessary and annoying effect I've ever seen.
---
I'm not the one bitching about how everyone I don't like is a carebear.
---
Nestors have a fitting service so if I have a bunch of spider-tank nestors near each other I would expect them to be able to refit in mid- fight for more tank or dps of whatever. I’ve even seen videos of people doing this. However when I try it, I get the “cannot refit due to an active weapons timer” message. Since the weapons of timer seems to come from the cap/rr chain I don’t see how I can avoid it. What am I doing wrong?
---
Nope. I've done it in the past, though.
---
&gt; wrong overview tab
---
Good god.  Why don't you have it on ALL your overview tabs, like a pro?
---
Mmm...no. The current system is that the gate only spawns when there's someone in the abyss for you to PvP with. So either the matchmaking system has to be rewritten and improved or the entire system has to be redone to allow people to take the gate even when no-one else is available to PvP with.
---
You're talking about potentially a dozen man-hours of programming at least. Programming is not so simple as writing "makeItWork = true".
---
Same problem here, Stuck on the message, didn't get SP
---
That's not what OP says he says the gate fails to spawn after 1300 no matter what.
---
Bastion are really nice landlords tbh
---
I'm quite confused and aroused
---
Did arancar perform the big oof?
---
Aye shit happens, provi does the same, was good fun for both sides tho so all good
---
But ... but... It's highsec... He was supposed to be safe !
---
Thats good if null is more dangerous than. Also good if people are going to WH to rat.
---
Everyone keeps bitching about ratting in WH space and i can tell people never lived in WH space. 
---
1) if you rat in your home system, you’re not going to make shit as it takes several days for sites to respond. Good luck ratting that with an alliance. It will force you to
---
2) roll your static WH and rat their sites. Which is a process, especially if you accidentally roll your BS out. Takes forever to scan yourself out then fly all the way to your entrance. About time you get there, that hoe collapsed. So you gotta use an alt and scan yourself a new entrance. You could however just eject and self destruct to get back to known space. It saves time but gets expensive.
---
3) once you get your ratting hole, you have to collapse all wh in it, then collapse your systems whs, have alts to make sure nothing pops in home system, while ratting, make sure nothing pops in ratting system etc. then you get to runs those few sites kinda safe. Oh, it takes a few pilots to run decent sites.
---
4) WH sites drop blue loot and requires you to haul it to Know space to trade it. The amount of people that dies to this is pretty high. Some area might run out of certain seeded buy orders of blue loot, requiring you to fly several additional jumps to sell.
---
5) no cynos in wh space either and everyone is cloakie. You get caught with you pants down, gg. Lastly, your cit can be killed within 24-48 hours dropping all loot inside. Zero asset safety and all the riches for the aggressor.
---
So yeah, let the ratters go to wh space. Just because local is gone in null doesn’t mean its just like wh space. Those are words from people who know nothing about living in it and are crying just to cry. I say let them move, let them get that taste, they run back to null within a few weeks.
---
Fewer blobs.
---
Frontline systems will mean lots of camps and the larger blob wins. Solo and small gang will basically be filtered out.
---
&gt; Keep your shit fueled and full power and the chances of you getting evicted are slim tbh
---
It's a Lie. Wormholers has always excuses.
---
I love spending hours looking for content from people scared of content.
---
No one interested in vacuum pvp without dis/scram in Ikitursa on 5bil build.
---
You don't need rigging skills to fit rigs.
---
Show me where nullsecers touched you.
---
he didn't, he said being sieged was more dangerous than being aligned in a carrier
---
There is no match making system, pilots are thrown together at random. If the gates spawn and only a single person uses the gate he gets to loot the arena uncontested after the wait timer runs out. 
---
The gate spawns if X amount of players are running abyssal space, so there is a check somewhere to see if there's enough people. Change the check, problem solved.
---
Or make it a mobile/browser stand alone game. That's advertising for eve and you could then do PI on the way to work, in breaks, on the toilet... .
---

As two of the apostles there, never not jump in to save a super.
---
Maybe I'm missing a hint but the Hecate ain't Caldari...
---
Ew dirty miner
---
One day we will meet supers v supers.
---
That's probably it then the gate doesn't spawn if the chance to get a fight is too low so that people don't get free loot most of the time during low pop hours.
---
Yup! I still remember the trailer ! Gives me goosbumbs everytime.. lets make eve great again
---
Because thats how APEX and Oracle export stuf, schema information (so a username) is needed within the export i changed them to different names but every time i make an export i need to redo this. The source code has been published and with every major step i will update it.
---
People who like big fights live in null, those who prefer more controllable fights live in WH space.
---
I wholeheartedly invite every null bear who thinks the removal of local makes Null the same as wormhole space to give it a shot. 
---
You might be surprised about the other differences. More so you might realize that you like it.
---
you can do it in PVE because you don't have weapon timer (unless you use smartbomb or accidentaly launch yours drones on your friend)
---
We don't want them you take em!
---
SoonTM, we get the bookmark with access list, why not fittings too?
---
So I went to buy something on the market today, and it told me it was 3 jumps away. So I highlight the location, click Set Destination, and boom. 19 jumps away. Am I not reading the Jumps portion of the market correctly?
---
Thank you
---
How about every time you cycle your jump drive a dev rolls a D48 and if it lands on 1 your ship explodes
---
I'll laugh when adms start decreasing because there is not as much pve going on in null. It's easier to attack sov when the indexes are down lol.
---
Probably u have in filter avoid system. For defaults all new players get jita in that filter, u can remove it from route settings. Or u have rout setting like security status filters.
---
Who is it?
---
Sounds good   would definantly make eve moee fun
---
It's not about ganking. It's about the bullshit they spread.
---
It's like looking at a  retarded child who pees on everything. It's just so fucking annoying, it makes eve a retarded place.  
---
Many other people are ganking and nobody bats an eye. The issue with CODE. is that they propagate stupidity.
---
Do you even logibro ?
---
Hopefully so, I look forward to it :)
---
We did have an NC pilot that flew with us Regularly, Providence have provided us with some really good laughs when they called a single pilot out as a bat-phone, or his presence as unfair and cowardly. Great times.
---
Horde are not part of RC, so you're right there! When was this? was it on more than a single occasion in the last year? I'd love some context.
---
we used vexors RR some time. ad one max tank exquror. your opponent will think it's your lonely logi and will try to kill it for years
---
I still mine in barges and make good isk doing so.
---
Thats not true tho, i did several abysal between 16:00 eve till 23:00 eve +/- and saw a few proving gates.
---
I’m being dumb I think. I was testing this by bashing an old POS. Presumably that’s where the timer was coming from.
---
I mean, I have attempted to form up Supers in Provi back in the day, and literally the only people who'd log on just to be bait tethered on a Fortizar were people in my own corp who've since left. I highly doubt Provi will ever commit Supers/Titans on grid with any active fight going on, just jump them in to plink at some Dreads that are already going to die.
---
Some nice drama right there! 5/7 goodread
---
I assume that an RTS game is more realistic then that gate in stain tbh
---
Holy shit I love it..
---
they roleplay much like any other alliance
---
And your point is ?
---
That's racist.
---
People are voting against instanced PVP shit with their time.
---
So you need more people stay safe now. So the manpower progression to stay reasonable safe is now Hi --》low --》wh --》 nullsec . But the highest rewards are found in wormholes, allowing new/small groups to build to build strength towards null (raiding or setling). (Eg. Wormhole groups are known for their drep wallets)
---
Looking at it, it's almost beautifully set up.
---
 [http://www.sarna.net/wiki/JumpShip](http://www.sarna.net/wiki/JumpShip) 
---
No random points, Zenir and Nadir it is (in addition to temporary pirate points)
---
Also the ability to misjump, so some of your umbrella might end up in the next solar system instead (possibility to misjump increases with every ship jumping in a certain time frame)
---
But you choose to use immobile ship to be more effective.     
---
There is trade of, that is similar for the NSA (super)carrier, sieged dread or bosoning titan in null.
---
So you telling me that goon leader telling someone to kill himself was okay ?
---
RP is fine when it sticks to RP domain. RP in a non-RP discussion is just BS. BS RP in a non-RP discussion is absolute cancer.
---
Could have easily AB'd out of range of porpoise scram. He thought he had the kill all the way through to the "Stop!" in local, after that it was just blind panic.
---
More fun than sitting in bomber and watching Rorquals or sitting in a Rorqual and not paying attention at all.

No thats old eve.

He also can't reveal that he is CCP Hilmar, so we'll never know unless he reveals it himself.

Don't undock in a shitfit like that. Always use MWD/cloak trick in a DST.
---
So might as well remove excavators.  Its completely ridiculous people are whining about the capability of a 1 billion isk drone!! Compared to a 2mill T2.  Honestly might as well.just remove them if they put in shit blockers to use them

is it though?

Yep, go 1v1 in Jita if that's what you want
---
We've had a guy from wingspan camping our wormhole for almost 2 months now, he gets almost no content and I cannot even imagine how boring his playstile must be.
---
To be perfectly honest I don't know why he hasn't moved on yet.
---
Calm down miner.
---
Exactly this BS. Calling people who disagree with you "miner" as a way to insult them.
---
THIS is why CODE. are considered the garbage of Eve.
---
what's the hour ?? it could be as simple as a bool to toggle the gate on or off , with off being near downtime, if something as simple as a 1 being a 0 could flip it to being off for 23 hours and on for 1 so yeah it could potentially be a super simple fix.
---
Historically speaking Wingspan doesn't value its time ;) if hes still there he must be enjoying the company you guys provide.

---

---
You could have just waited it out. They would have gotten bored eventually and left
---
Invest, push, or have faith in the growth of the alliance you're in, recruit more friends like the ones you described and get more practice and use with those toys so that pilots have faith and confidence in the opposite channel to do said drops. 
---
*However* you were part of the Bloc for a long time, so I can only expect it got tedious waiting for any of that to happen? Or perhaps it just wasn't happening! I can't say as I've not been a higher up in ProviBloc, and I wasn't in your shoes at the time.
---
Military and Civilian leadership in Provi was heavily segregated. People like EQ and corp leaders make diplomatic, recruitment and budgeting decisions, as an FC you shoot people and do what they tell you. 
---
It's a huge part of why I left.

Nah, butthurt thin skin man children like you are the garbage of EVE.

Here's a great guide for wormhole evictions:
---
[Wormhole Eviction Survival Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8yye3r/wormhole_eviction_survival_guide_for_beginners/)
---
It both tells you how to not be a target and how to survive getting evicted. If you ever want to get established in a wormhole, you should probably keep this guide as a reference. Keeping your structures fueled is key, though, I sometimes do solo evictions with up to 6 alts if I ever encounter a low power structure because I usually assume that the corp is either new to wormholes and easy to evict, or it's inactive so there won't be any defense. I sometimes make up to a bil during these operations, so they're usually worth my time.
---
I'm still unclear on wtf ccp were thinking when they decided to put optional, instanced, 1v1 PVP behind 10+ minutes of instanced PVE.
---
Actually he told me that 3D women were better than 2D and I ragequit in disgust.
---
What? Spoiler? This has been the background login for 3 days at least, if not since the "season of skills" last week?

NIP means Non-Invasion Pact. Nothing in that implies anything but "we won't invade you space".
---
Here you can see several neutral states,  [https://sov.space/](https://sov.space/) I admit that some of them does have some kind of deal with The imperium (at least French ConneXion is light blue to us) but at least the so called cockroach coalition have no deal with us.
---
I've killed so many asteros where the reason they've died is because they've gimped their fit trying to dual purpose it.
---
Judging by their use of tech 1 meta 0 mods all over these fits already, I'm sure the shittiness will be glorious
---
What do you know about capitals? You had problem runaway from x6 in your little shiny absolution while you harby fleet was wiped out.
---
It's a double edged sword. Provi won't use supers/titans or push for their use but also can't use their supers/titans because potential pilots leave for other alliances that actively use them so in turn, they have very few.
---
You probably had your route-finder set to 'Safest' instead of 'Shortest', meaning it took the long way around in order to avoid lowsec space. Alternatively, you had one of the systems on the 3j route set to 'avoid', meaning your route will never take you through there.
---
Better scan bonus means u scan faster, find sites faster. And again, the covops come out to be cheaper than the astero.
---
Aligntime is a nonissue if you use your brain and dscan. The only things that will be able to kill you are blaster bombers or smartbombing t3cs, both of which are pretty rare to see.
---
Total lie.........There is no cocaine there.
---
I'd certainly prefer it over the status quo.
---
But I'd change it slightly; so the outcome is less predictable, and **less severe for those willing to put in the effort**.
---
1. Keep cynos.
---
2. Pilots manually align the ships in the direction of the destination system. These points are already available in-space. They're used by the Show Route In Space option in the autopilot -- a cool graphical thing that hasn't had any gameplay use yet.
---
3. Scale the deviation from the destination point (with [the `tanh` function](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tanh+function&amp;t=ffab&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images)) according to how well aligned the ship is.
---
4. Scale the capacitor usage for the jump (with [the `sigmoid` function](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=sigmoid+function&amp;t=ffab&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images)) the same way.
---
5. Completely re-work `Jump Drive Operation` and `Jump Drive Calibration` to reduce the penalties for being out of alignment.
---
6. Jump Fatigue reduction bonuses on JFs, Blops, etc all get role bonuses for jump-deviation and cap-cost.
---
7. ***Maybe*** scale Fatigue timers as well. I don't have any strong feelings on *how* to scale this one.
---
# What good things come from this?
---
Pilots that are patient and prepared to align before jumping land where they want to be, *and* they land with some extra capacitor to use.
---
It creates a talent-gap between good and shit pilots. One that can't be entirely overcome by Skill Injectors. 
---
Fuck-ups create content. Content is good. Any manual process a player does can be fucked up. Therefore, any manual process a player does can create content. 
---
# What bad things come from this?
---
You can intentionally misalign and dump yourself way off grid. I imagine moving solo Supers would fucking love this shit. I mean, this is a really fucking horrible consequence of this. Intentional misalignment is the rational choice when moving. Jump to your cyno. Land 10AU from it, being the only person on-grid. Cloak. Laugh in local as everyone logs in Dictors and HICs. Hell, you don't even do that. You light two cynos in different systems. If they're in null, nobody knows where you've jumped to.
---
# So I propose an extra change:
---
8. Warping and cloaking is prevented for a short time, proportional to how poorly your ship was aligned. An penalty is needed to make it undesirable to deliberately misalign a jump.
---
They're talking about the Sotiyos and Forts we've murdered with the Horde blob Paxy.
---
It especially doesn't help them for ccp to encourage the use of shitty meta 0 modules. I even see "old" players use them sometimes.
---
If that response is 50 titans jumping in then there wont be a battle. Which is the case in 90% of the rorqs you tackle.
---
Yes, bashing a POS will give you a timer. You used to be able to refit regardless, and the most prominent manifestation of this mechanic was called cross-fitting triage, used extensively by Rooks'n'Kings, that may be where you saw it.
---
Well, if you can't even launch the launcher, then may Bob have mercy on your soul.
---
This. No sane person is going to rf fullpower astra because 3 days of cancer 24h holecontrol and waiting to maybe get 2-4b of loot.
---
I think it was the first one. We fed you easy content as soon as we got our structure anchored. We where new to wh so we realised we needed a propper deffensive fleet. We then said for people not to feed you which we did not do but zam slam allready had a alt in our corp by that time. We where still trying to work out deffensive fleet to possibly counter you but realised with zam in our corp and discord it would be useless. He even admitted to this as he stated whatever we brought to deffend, you would have brought more to counter and because you had the strategic advantage o took the decision to pull out of the WH.
---
Everytime we tried to leave and a ping was sent to get stuff out we where met with 3 guys on the high sec with a drag bubble.
---
We where trapped in the C1 and so zam said he would buy the athanor from us. We did manage to get 80% out doing really sneaky stuff but with him in our corp it was impossible to survive in a WH with the corp being so open. 
---
And yes the structure was attacked repeatedly by wingspan and reinforced. Never into hull timer but was made cery clear that there was nothing we could do other than leave.
---
Who?
---
I'd play it.
---
Yeah but excavator are half the price they were 3 months ago, losing a set is only going to cost you under 2bil
---
It took me two days to program a database job to compute date ranges!
---
Programming is hard yo.
---
without local it would be pretty dumb, as caps / supers would randomly appear with 0 warning, and be safe in 1 mwd cycle (10 seconds).
---
Since they would be in warp to a safe citadel / pos.
---
Would almost entirely eliminate hunting in LS except for a few systems where most supers have to go through to cross lowsec.
---
Try to learn how to fit a ship ASAP ! Use Zkillboard to find ideas, ask people in game or watch some youtube videos it will help you a lot. Keep going, one day you will be the killer.
---
Yes, exactly how you write it. 
---
The general use of insults by CODE. is why people despise them, not because they gank other people.
---
I never knew how much I hated that zoom motion until this video.

It's far too salient. If it was like 10% the size, it might be okay.

I couldn't find any patch notes anywhere
---
This.  The role playing garbage and salt mining take it over the top imo.  I see ganking as a legitimate playstyle but CODE takes all of that to the literal extreme.
---
I even had a situation last sunday where the gate did not spawn while someone else was in. 
---
The matching system is simple: first to take gate first to get fight, so they are filled one after the other
---
On the other hand it would make catching JFs laughably easy.

---
Man I fucking loved that game. I grew up playing Homeworld and it's sequel, and the original Ground Control (GC2 was shite). Still go back to replay them every now and then.
---
Then suddenly Deserts came out. I was expecting more of a Homeworld feel at first so wasn't sure on it, but then it suddenly clicked and I enjoyed it immensely and can't help but feel now it combines the old Homeworld and Ground Control. Love that game now

Bit off topic there sorry but I got excited when I saw you mention Deserts...

Having that NIP means that French ConneXion wont get invaded by The Imperium, this making them a vassal state to The Imperium. If they were truly independent then they would have no such deals with any large bloc.

Oh, right, lol
---
Never happening lol. I do love the idea behind Provi, but I'm not the kinda guy who's gonna go for EQ's throne. He's built a great thing, and even if I disagree with him on a few things, it'd be incredibly wrong of me to take that away from him.
---
SMA is in charge of the QFC but they have been released from the shackles of Sov and have rented the space to NSH.
---
which means JF's become completely useless :P
---
CODE. ganking Goons!?
---
It all makes sense now!
---
Pretty sure that was out in Etherium Reach for the Fortizars, A sotoyo went down last year. Just using our kill history alone paints a different picture to the batphone accusations, I think it's moderate accounting for the fact that interactions and kills with other groups will happen occasionally. 
---
I do believe we've got a good thing here with Provi, like a private warzone between our Blocs with little interferance, Provi has the power and numbers to punish our mistakes. It's a good thing.
---
I don't think we're batphone happy in the slightest.
---
I dont get what The Mittani, at fanfest, with a wizard har has to do with CODE being a roleplaying alliance...
---
Been saying it for years. Take the lessons of Dust, and release a fun RTS, fully tied into to Eve or FW. Units cost ISK, and when they die, they're gone.

so they picked an effective way to remove excavators without actually removing them? good

"It’s very important to note here that this means all the skillpoints available to buy on the market in EVE will have originated on other characters where they were trained at the normal rate.  Player driven economies are key to EVE design and we want you to decide the value of traded skillpoints while we make sure there is one single mechanism that brings new skillpoints in to the system – training."
---
I did not say they did.
---
What I said is that using RP as an excuse to insult people is just as a good reason to despise the person, as using RP to harass people.
---
"RP is fine when it sticks to RP domain. RP in a non-RP discussion is just BS. BS RP in a non-RP discussion is absolute cancer."

Also this: https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98606027/
---
Okay im positive you're just nuts. Have a good day
---
I agree nuke it
---
"you are nuts" then "have a good day" is deeply hypocrite.
---
Maybe for an upcoming update? Interesting...
---
yep thats true, and as the problem started in april it has nothing to do with the Ikitursa, even this ship has counters like the curse or cerb
---
1. You used to
---
2. Penalty of the rig may be too harsh for your fitting without good rigging skill
---
Lol I guess CCP did an oopsie, the next patch was scheduled for august or am I wrong? Somehow the patch ended up being applied today \^\^
---
What?
---
https://i.imgur.com/pNf4OFr.png
---
not yet
---
There won't be a long-term if the short-term dies out. Running Tests on your playerbase is a bad idea.
---
Well, not anymore...
---
"Dead"... I don't know about you guys, but I think I just got a new abyss toy to play with o/
---
A Frontline is the only way to add Geography that is significant to the Warzone.
---
The Capture Bonuses are actually are in to create niches, you can have bonuses that are not combat-oriented and that can be exploited by another kind of population than FW Soldiers, like explorers, miners, and industrialists.
---
I do agree that it might lead to some systems and plexes being overcrowded, but this can easily be resolved through the variable of X systems away from the Frontline being contestable.
---
So I don't think there is much of an issue here, the advantages easily outweigh the disadvantages.
---
During the skilling spree event even. CCPls what do I do!?
---
Awesome, will be fun to fly the new VNI. 
---
If the VNI nerf patch was today, shouldn't there be patch notes?
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/ptgdti/patch-notes-for-june-2019-release last update was July 16th (and the patch notes page itself has June release as the latest). 
---
Seems a bit sloppy.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/eDRIxn4.png](https://i.imgur.com/eDRIxn4.png)  
---
It's the announced change and live on TQ, just checked in-game.
---
OK!
---
Totally agree.
---
someone got ganked (because he is bad at the game), yelled at the gankers and is surprised that they slur back XD
---
Lmao how the fuck do you call yourself an eve player ahahaha
---
Yes.
---
Next months MER is going to be interesting
---
Warp to anom... align out... kill one npc...
---
Not hard is it? :)
---
The MER will be so low everywhere because of the blackout!
---
My screenshot was right from the in-game client about 15 minutes ago.
---
esp if you are watching it during a break at work without sound
---
oh my god, fuck off with your pussy shit. Go play overwatch or something.
---
Apparently the Hecate was unaffiliated, but he would’ve wrecked my day had he engaged.
---
The VNI you knew is dead. A new VNI rises from its ashes to rain hellfire on frigates and destroyers.
---
He was constantly cherry picking and getting super emotional on comms about it, apparently he did the exact same in goons...
---
Where did they announce it wouldn't hit until later?
---
The whole skilling spree and other skillpoint crap is a thinly disguised attempt to boost log in numbers to make up what they've lost but won't admit due to the blackout!
---
It's a Wingspan classic to camp holes for quite literally forever. Usually cloaked on a B274, for days or weeks on end.
---
At least, that's how the legend goes.
---
Did you ever stop to think that it’s annoying for a reason?
---
Don't know wether a specific date to the VNI changes was ever gives, but I'm pretty sure I knew this would happen for at least a month or two. Why even try to learn it if you have a month (at least) heads-up?
---
Harden up snowflake
---
Who cares ?
---
The question was "why people dislike CODE." The answer is "because they are shitty brats". Nobody ain't time to find out the deep personal issues of players in a MMO…
---
As I vaguely recall, it being quite early where I am, it was supposed to hit like an August patch or something, maybe even a bit later...I certainly don't remember it being today, in July, since my skill plan for my Alpha was designed to complete before the scheduled nerf.
---
Not interested.
---
Some people use Evemon to keep an eye on their account training queues.
---
Like... the video or people not broadcasting for reps?
---
we just imported from highsec previously v0v.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/78003221/
---
I would like to add, like every other newbro we nuke, we do invite you to join the alliance, in this case we were bored and gate camping was a low effort low risk.
---
We encourage all those who learn the hard way why there is a warning on lowsec gates to join and we are happy to help and teach anyone who is willing, we are assholes, but we are not dicks.
---
I would like to give a shout out the the madlad who lost his ferox on a besieged site and then had the balls to return in a hauler to scoop his loot and foxtrot oscar before both me and the rats caught him o7 to that guy
---
Greg
---
I wasn't talking about the VNI skills I was talking about other nerfs like to Alpha drones..as for VNI I was mostly done with that training when they announced they were going to nerf it.
---
Miner, calm down. I’m trying to help you. It’s not hard to understand. Plenty of people gank, you’re right, but we’re the ones you remember. We’re the ones that get all the hate.
---
No pls dont try edit eve videos like CoD vids
---
Alright mate, maybe stop reading the Express yea
---
No specific date was ever specified. They projected it for early August when it was first discussed, nothing more.
---
Look at the headline it reads krab bin is dead
---
Which is fine by me afk ratting as a concept for playing a game is retarded
---
Hahahahah. Just grab. Free or discounted nyx and rat havens instead. Remember two titans in the hangar. One shield one armor.
---
Decreasing player pleasure is not good business.
---
In business you only sell two things:
---
Provide or increase pleasure or at least the hope of pleasure
---
Decrease or prevent pain or at least the hope of doing either.
---
You sell NOTHING else.
---
You're welcome for your free MBA tip.
---
Was a pretty fun fight, thanks for the invite, we never thought we would join a WH fleet to welp arty thrashers into Cerbs &lt;3 That was fantastic. GF to everyone
---
Yeah I do. But as you said "some". Which means some people will get a big surprise.
---
porps have been workin it recently
---
What the hell is the Express?
---
Because depots dont load into fit simulations REEEE
---
25 July 2019 is not "early August", now is it?
---
The map zoom sound in Homeworld is better than every sound effect in EVE combined, change my mind.
---
The tracking disruptor one is a beast. https://zkillboard.com/kill/74069632/
---
WHERE'S MY AIR SUPPORT?
---
:finger moves over ORBITAL STRIKE confirmation button:
---
Well salt mines like this thread increase pleasure for a lot of the r/eve-playerbase XD
---
they didn't give a solid date, so it could've been any time. have fun
---
Managed to bait this one to station guns :D
---
Yes, not everything must be balanced around 250 man Fleet.
---
close enough.
---
The Bonus is on hull. Impossible to balance Logis. Dedicated Tank ship bad design. Solo Gameplay. Investigate?
---
with or against?
---
yes why not, and we could name this bonus "resistance profile"
---
&gt;As I vaguely recall, it being quite early where I am
---
u wot m8
---
Congrats, that's pretty rad!
---
Because logi get a remote repair bonus already, and they don't want you to double dip on bonuses I suppose.
---
Because :
---
1. Not all ships are made to be fleet ships
---
2. Logistic ships have the bonus for remote repair and considering the current state of affairs (Faxes fucking up logistics) you just straight up want more buffer than a buff to RR applied unto you
---
Meh, it's fine. Didn't realize Alphas could use T1 BC's and BS's till yesterday, so there's reason enough for me to try and play again.
---
Wouldn't you be locked from using it as Alpha even if you did complete it?
---
#reviveDust514
---
I'm sorry but if you managed to bait Wingspan into bashing you out of a hole, YOU fucked up. WDN doesn't like bashes.
---
Look at your active processes and make sure Eve isn't running a process behind the scenes. This happened to me just now, to fix it I closed an invisible client and it launched. G/L
---
The sooner these changes hit the better. I really do not see the problem with nerfing the VNI today.
---
People always underestimate the difficulty of tasks they don't understand.
---
&gt;Guarantee some people who don't log in everyday are out their thinking  their training in similar skills is perking along and they will come  back and find they've wasted TIME!
---
Wasted free time on their alpha account with a 24-hour queue. The horror!
---
Yeah NONE of those for whom "salt mines" like this increase pleasure for are in business..have ever operated a business or owned a business ALL of which I have done and CONTINUE to do whilst people who think all the silly crap CCP does "is just great!" whilst living in mummy and daddy's basement, playing EVE with one hand and either eating or jerking off with the other!
---
You're damn right stupid business decisions make me salty. REGARDLESS of business. Gaming, food, travel...doesn't matter! Stupidity pisses me off...which means I stay pissed off a lot but what the hell, it fuels my strength in the Dark Side.
---
PS I guarantee if I didn't add this PS some fool would take that Dark Side comment seriously.
---
Both the blackout and skilling spree are great. I don’t get why this skilling spree would be a problem.
---
Nerf bombers
---
&gt;There is no match making system, pilots are thrown together at random.
---
So the system that **matches** pilots together at random is the issue.
---
&gt;The gate spawns if X amount of players are running abyssal space, so there is a check somewhere to see if there's enough people. Change the check, problem solved.
---
This is making a pretty big assumption as to how the system works. It's likely the system doesn't, in fact, work like that under the hood. And you're also asserting that "changing the check" is as simple as flipping a variable and not, say, a few days of work rewriting other systems which are dependent upon that check.
---
Thank you. Will check it out
---
just feed him a hulk and he'll leave :)
---
That sounds like a you problem.
---
Not sure really...
---
Dead for AFK ratting, as intended :)
---
It becomes a omega skill, you would be locked from it as Alpha.  You would have to be Omega to use it if you had completed the skill train.
---
Since you're complaining about things that only affect alpha accounts -
---
Consider actually becoming a paying customer?
---
Free MBA tip: Freemium models work it there is good value in upgrading away from the free plan.
---
There's your mistake. Planning based on vague recollections of assumed dates that they never even stated.
---
Bet you think blackout increased player count too...and don't give me the bot argument. A lot of people who get fed up with CCP crap were not bots.
---
Ironically the guy who got me into the game, surely not intentionally, he was just talking about  having played it during lunch break after someone else was talking about Bengazi , quit 5 years ago after CCP nerf hammers and so on pissed him off one time too many.
---
Which in consequence is their own fault, as all sources of information are public. Seems like you still have not understood, that the pleasure of this game to its core audience (obv. not you) is that it is hard, not convenient and punishing ...
---
man if you can fitt the new vni like you can fitt a vexor and ishtar it will be super nice (blaster, 2x rep web scram cap booster mwd )
---
Probably the Daily Express, a tabloid of ill repute in the UK. Prone to, umm, exaggerations. Yellow Journalism
---
Hey you over looked the part where I said I have BOTH!
---
Go to the back of the line.
---
The Horror!!!!!! Reeeeeeeee
---
OH EM GEE! Your training queue got messed up and you need to fix it???? 
---
Please someone call the President immediately, if not sooner.
---
Ok well never had an Alpha post any nerf with that effect and once I take an Omega to Omega I never let it slip back so I had no idea what happens.
---
Those days at the office are why I re-subbed.
---
Jumping to the sun is something that I've been saying for years makes more sense, but 10k from the sun probably won't happen. 
---
In the game's engine the sun is actually where they store offline, and lost ships (failed cyno attempts) so more than likely the better option is random location in Target system.
---
Thanks, I needed something to laugh at.
---
That medium guns buff will make sure that any cruiser that can't outrun it will also melt under it's hellfire! lol
---
You knew at least a month in advance that alphas would no longer be able to use those skills, and yet you chose to queue them up anyways.
---
This is no-one's fault but your own.
---
Its actually pretty useful for those of us who breathe through our noses
---
Like i stated 10AU sphere around the star
---
No?  Your post indicates you have Omega status but Omega status does not imply you're paying - A minimal skills alpha toon can relic site farm to a a Plex in \~24h of gameplay.
---
A bonus that works on local reps and remote reps is Resistance. That's already a thing.
---
Hence, the word projection. 
---
You're right though - for once, CCP delivers early. I consider this a success.
---
they posted this nerf to forums abiut week ago...
---
CCP is going to lose maybe 1 person because of this, and that guy's a massive idiot for training skills he knew in advance wouldn't be usable, so I don't think anyone really should care.
---
Also, sincerely doubt you're qualified to dispense business advice.
---
The unfortunate downside to lowering our barrier to entry is that it lets in muppets like OP who can't think ahead
---
&gt;I log into my Alpha and discover my training que for a skill that WAS allowed and was supposed to continue to be allowed for a few has been screwed!
---
Why would you still be training those when you knew they were getting shitcanned?
---
Like what was your endgame here?  "Oooo, I can get 5% out of this for a whole week!"
---
Oh, wait, you're serious. Let me laugh even harder.
---
Oof the error 500 hit you too?
---
The question remains why you still chose to train skills you knew would be unusable.
---
1) You skipped the part where I said I, like many people have both Omegas and Alphas.
---
2) Expanding on the point. The people who are cheering would have stayed if nothing had been done while on the other hand you run the risk of losing paying customers because of what is done.
---
3) As I've said elsewhere, because of my background and general nature stupid decisions ESPECIALLY stupid business decisions ROYALLY piss me off, REGARDLESS of business!
---
For example there's a particular meal delivery service that thought it would be a good idea to start going full BOHICA on the restaurants they had previously "partnered" with. Bad move in ways I don't even feel like going into here.
---
MBA Tip: Yes.
---
Ok... Dude, we have a number of toys to play with, don't we?
---
Why would all of them need to be done taking "fleet ops" has top priority? :(
---
im so fkin hyped to try it :) quiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick pyfa, we need an uptade !
---
Could have just made Dust available on PC. Yeah I'm never shutting up about that.
---
You mean decreasing bots pleasure to rmt?
---
tl;dr:     REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
---
God dammit stainguy got me again
---
If you take pleasure while VNI ratting something is very wrong with you.
---
He can't be that dumb. I mean, he runs [actual businesses in real life](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/chmour/eve_screws_over_players_again_unscheduled_nerfs/euv8h0e?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) while you sit around in your mum's basement jerking off!
---
&gt; Also if we're still taking suggestions, what about offering another type of FW mission?
---
This should interest you:

---
FTFY
---
You won't unless you know where to look and what to look for. Even then without access to internals it will be more deductive that fact based but the fundamentals I mention are inescapable.
---
1)If I am pissed off others are pissed off. Unknown how many
---
2)SOME will be pissed off enough to finally say, you know what? Fuck it.
---
What's telling about this is the meme "Winning EVE=quitting EVE".
---
3)MOST important. It is ALWAYS more expensive in ANY business to get a new customer than it is to keep an old customer. All "them bittervets" people joke about are LOST REVENUE!
---
I recollected enough to not be at all worried about it in JULY!
---
How effective/viable are T3Ds for contesting actual objectives in k-space?
---
And what, exactly, are you buying from them? And how?
---
This would greatly reduce the effectiveness of dread bombs, yes.
---
why goodbye? it got buffed
---
All the first person to ASSume bigly! Congrats!!!!
---
I didn't say what I used my VINI for did I?
---
Not only this, but due to the generally inhospitable environment for subcap ratters in general.
---
So what are you training an alpha VNI for exactly ? Because as far as I know the new VNi is going to be a beast
---
Happy cake day!!!
---
This would break the economy not fix it.  They need to return minerals to their sec status distributions.  This would not cause any inflation spoke but rather a lack of supply cost raise on Minerals which is a good thing and what is desired actually
---
in germany theres one called just "Express" too and it sounds like theyre very similar
---
The appeal of highsec, especially for more social/PvP minded players, has always been that highsec is where most of the population of players can be found. Look at the data and you will clearly see that most PvP activity in EVE still occurs in highsec - it is a target rich environment. For non-PvPers it is still a more social environment, most commerce happens there too.
---
Its common to see *certain* nullseccers or wormholers acting superior like you're doing (usually folks who just migrated from highsec within the last few weeks), but it isn't very sporting and won't make you any friends.
---
🤣
---
Actually I kid of like the Blackout since I have plenty of WH experience.
---
I don't understand bottech specifically nor can I code, but I have enough general knowledge of coding and tech in general to know that anyone who thinks the blackout and even nerfing is more than a minor inconvenience, ESPECIALLY to the really big botters who can afford to pay for countermeasures is a damn fool!
---
Pretty much like the War on Drugs in the Western World.
---
Might bring back the moros at some point right?
---
Is there any tabloid of good repute?
---
Yeah..I bet that's really working, just like the War on Drugs is.
---
I’m bad. And that’s good. I will never be good. And that’s not bad. There’s no one I’d rather be than VNI
---
All seriousness though, it went from PvE to PvP which is awesome
---
Just tell them to adapt into 1 million ehp broken toys
---
Congrats! You are the second person to ASSume bigly on this thread!!!
---
against, edited.
---
Lol
---
Yes, I would agree, but it is not the same VNI that I have known for years now. It is a new ship with different possibilities.
---
you shitpost but that's actually what we're doing lol
---
The entitlement is big on this one.
---
What a mong
---
I have the issue on 1 of 4 accounts. After DT same one still has the issue.
---
Aha!!! Someone made a potentially astute, though incorrect, assumption about me! So much so that I won't even say you that you chose to ASSume! 
---
CONGRATZ!!!! I won't say "most impressive", but I will give you an "surprisingly impressive"! Those don't happen much!
---
I like to read the stories about how the Yellowstone Supervolcano is going to blow up at any minute.   It puts the worries of Alpha training in perspective.
---
Look in the mirror.
---
Oh.
---
How come the worm is good for this? wouldnt a cruiser be better (and much cheaper) if your running the sites solo?
---
Yeah..you mean that core audience that's demonstrably declining?
---
Mmmk..
---
Maybe ccp can design a new celestis model while they're in the Gallente zone?
---
I dont know, why are you asking me?
---
This is my fairly young cap stable alt dps VNI that required a minimum amount of input. It might only have had 14 killmarks but it has helped me more than that. I will miss you buddy.
---
And yes, it is stretched because I am bad at video editing.
---
Has P3AK killed Frat already?
---
It makes perfect sense to start with a shit-fit and do the learning curve yourself instead of the other way around
---
Lets hope CCP doesn't get the idea to balance capitals next eh?
---
&gt;These aren’t the only balance changes planned for the next few months, and we’ll discuss some of the other balance proposals being developed in a separate future dev blog.
---
🤔
---
"Fault"? Interesting choice of words...
---
1) Don't really "care" about the consequences to the toon or two
---
2) As stated elsewhere stupid business moves REGARDLESS of business tend to piss me off.
---
3) This thread is making it amusingly easy to deduce what percent of EVEers live in mummy and daddy's basement.
---
Are you telling me that you have difficulty killing between 1 and 10 random NPCs now that the VNI has been changed?
---
&gt; since my skill plan for my Alpha was designed to complete before the scheduled nerf.
---
So you totally intended on training a skill you knew would be taken away. And now you're complaining that it's been taken away?
---
Hello Kitty online is ---&gt; that way
---
What was the point on training them, if you won't be able to use them anyway
---
Had a plan.
---
My bank, stock, credit union and other counts say that you to chose to
---
ASSume! A lot of that going around not only in this subRED but the world at large.
---
Originally set for sometime in August. I have a life beyond EVE and reading EVE forums. In some games I'm what's called a casual.
---
give this man a whoosh
---
Oh noes, they released it at least 6 days early!
---
True workhorse of the nullsec. 
---
\*Sheds one manly tear.\*

Goodbye, sweet princess. We had a blast together, you running around a hub like a hamster on methamphetamine, your little children relentlessly killing everything in sight.... While i was watching hbo and listening to the cries of dying rattlesnakes on comms. Good times.
---
I have to wonder what could have been if dust had an economic model like warframe....and the farming of resources in dust could be sold to eve players
---
Oh I quite think ahead and am especially adept at "improvise, adapt, overcome". It's literally what I do.
---
&gt; a lack of supply cost raise on Minerals
---
AKA, inflation.
---
Okay guys. The vni is dead. What will the new crab drone boat be? Myrmidon?
---
Sorry explain this to me.
---
You ever hear the term "on time, on target"? More importantly you ever LIVE the term "on time, on target"?
---
Congratz! You win poorest snark so far. But I doubt you'll keep that title. Surely someone will surpass you.
---
What were you going to do if you had the depo? You said "If I get scrammed i'm going to..." and didn't finish!
---
Had a plan based on a certain timetable.
---
Total Annihilation or nothing.
---
WTF is a mong?
---
You are just an absolute gem, this is great.
---
Jesus call a fucking waaaaaaambulance. 'My free shit is less than it used to be" are you 3 years old? You knew very well these changes were incoming. It is a courtesy from CCP to know exact dates for changes.
---
Except for the last Tiberium game and those shitty browser games that EA have been pushing.
---
Hey, so the description field for ship fittings has pretty limited amount of space. Just about enough for a short description, link to the character who suggested the fit and another link to the forums. 
---
The idea for future fits is to include a link in the description to the forum post of the player who suggested the fit. That way anyone who uses the fit can get an idea as to its purpose and why the player suggested using the modules they did.
---
Why ask? Does that have any effect on whether or not the fundamental OVERALL theme is valid or not? If you don't remember I'll remind you.
---
Wew, edgy. Then do illuminate all of us making incorrect assumptions, as your OP apparently left out some major details that you'd like us to know?
---
Otherwise the only ASS is U not ME =).
---
It's certainly a valid point. Our awesome ISD will be periodically reviewing the fits to ensure they are still valid. If a bad fit does appear on TQ we can take it down usually within 24 hours.
---
"We hear you! And, as it happens we agree. For the most part anyways. We do actually have an EVE RTS in the works.  The good news is that it will be a Neo Geo system exclusive title because someone in a bathroom at Iceland Denny's assured Hilmar that it was the right move.
---
We expect a December launch to coincide with returning winter players." -CCP Probably
---
So many are old / out of meta
---
Had a plan. Plan got fucked. New plan took about 1 minute of thought. Slightly longer to implement
---
Well, unless they're dropping their EHP to below battleship levels, I doubt it's going to matter.
---
They've been saying they were discussing cap cap changes for ages. We got some fax changes to show for it, I guess.
---
Well, you lot carry on. Got real life to do. I do want to thank one responder, who shall remain unidentified, who quite accidentally and inadvertently gave me a valuable thought buried within what was intended to be snark. No, not you, you only think it was you. It was somebody else.
---
I doubted that any reasonable explanation, based on proven game server stats will convince you, as you are a koolaid-influenced guy, that still thinks that this patch will drive off more low-effort-people that think afk-ing is a legit way of creating ingame currency than it will bring back old players that have quit the game exactly because of the Meta that was now (finally) patched ...
---
Rats by default will want to shoot the drones over your domi more than they would with the VNI due to signature radius.  You'll want to apply some ewar to attract their hate.  idk what's preferred these days, but I'm sure someone will chime in.
---
Love it I always come to reddit to restore my faith in humanity 😭😭
---
isthar and proteus : are sure about that???
---
Happy cakeday :)
---
It's really not. It's just not the totally dominant option for it anymore.
---
GSF is already reimbursing ratting Myrms to ease the transition :p
---
I wish I had a super
---
Well, back to the Ishtar like its 2012.
---
Cool
---
That video is actually against NCPL, silly
---
can someone explain to me please why this buff makes it a worse crabbing ship?
---
Try! It might be entertaining! You got graphs? Be warned I've seen graphs!
---
Come on! Your posts were starting to get good!
---
Nigga S A L T Y, pay for sub you cheap bitch
---
Cringe
---
No as your answer reveals the trolling purpose already
---
Light drones take the least aggro by far. Heavy drones will get some targeting sometimes. And medium drones are like offensive stereotypes or something because the rats will fixate so hard on them that i've encountered situations where the rats will go fully idle after i pull my drones back in.
---
That is yet another ASSumption! Congratz! That makes..oh..two for you right?
---
If your using it for PvP it’s more powerful now.
---
We just opened up some forum threads  looking for suggested fits for destroyers running the Sisters of EVE Epic Arc and  frigates for PvP. 
---
We're currently focusing on fits for new players, so the modules need to be tech 1, relatively cheap, effective in their role and usable by Alpha players. 
---
If you have some fits you would like to submit as a potential Community Fit then please head over to the forum section CCP Lebowski linked above.
---
Target spectrum breaker works best but only if you have its skill to 5.

It’s a fun event to give you some free skill points for shooting some NPCs.
---
Stop complaining.
---
So, I spent the last year training 12 accounts for the VNI. All that money, wasted. Was hoping to undock them all when I returned from my break. I think this game is trying to tell me something. I am not a happy guy.
---
I was going to do as well as make an AUR deployment for Arch Linux but just haven't found the time.
---
May the old VNI never be spoken of again.
---
The new one looks awesome.
---
I find telling the truth to people about all sorts of things AMUSING AS HELL! Mainly because a lot of the coolest stuff that's true about me would be a lie coming from 99% of the population. You have no idea how much fun it is seeing the looks on people's faces when they discover I was serious.
---
I'll give you an easy one: I'm taller than 99% of the adult male population. There's lots more but that would impossible to dispute whilst many guys have to lie about that...among other things.
---
This is an amusing response, given that your whole crybaby whine thread descends from your assumption that the change wouldn't hit until August.
---
If you operate and own so many businesses, why you too poor to have omega?
---
LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE
---
The door is that way --&gt;
---
Don't let it hit you in the ass on the way out.
---
Stop botting.
---
dominix reporting
---
VNI is an excellent ship now, better than it used to be. Just cause they changed it, don't go throwing your toys out the pram. If you quit over something like this EVE isn't the game for you, they don't want to deliver the same, stale experience.
---
Lol, take an upvote!
---
CCP already fixed cloaky AFKers
---
There's a newspaper in the world somewhere that isn't prone to exaggeration?  Why would you pick out the Express I wonder.
---
Your posting style is toxic and edgy, is what he said. And he is totally correct. That is not an assumption but a factual statement ...
---
Enjoy the changes! :)
---
If you can't fight 2-3 people Wormholes are probably not for you
---
Is there any newspaper or alphabet media org of good repute?
---
-50 drone bandwidth = effectively - a lot of afk dps
---
wah wah they put a nerf with no announcement date into effect we've known about for a while.
---
meh, learn to use an active ship
---
Seems like you made an ASSumption there my friend
---
Hey that was pretty good! First pretty good post in the whole thread! Your explanation didn't show up at first for some reason, only the hello kitty comment.
---
Anyway..anyone making money as you described will STILL be making money. Works the same as the "War on Drugs". Probably the same actually. Best estimates are the WOD only costs the Cartels 10% in increased operating costs. The WORMT/BOTs numbers are probably the same. For some reason the general public for the WOD and the EVE public seem to prefer to believe in fantasies...well since EVE is a fantasy at least that makes sense.
---
ooh, I didn't know it lost bandwidth. Alright thanks for the info!
---
This sounds like a real mess, would venture to guess some one got rich at the end of this “accident”
---
50 bandwidth was removed. Now it can only field 3 heavy drones, or 2 heavy, 2 medium and 1 light drone for max dps. Also a portion of its dps is now locked in with guns (that also use cap). So it makes them much less efficient for going afk in.
---
It is rather bad tho. The older ones atleast had an element of idk. Boosters/drugs are fun fun fun!
---
So how do you want covert cyno’s work?  The same some where in system or does the 150 man bomber fleet get to be straight on grid?   If they go on grid that would be an unfair advantage to the bombers.  All you will end up with is having faxes in the mining belts with the rorqs and then people will complain that the easy kill is taken away again.
---
Nope..at the time I made the decision/plan the specifics while not concrete where...oh hell never mind..point is. Me not remembering NOW is not the same as me ASSuming back THEN.
---
Least useful for fleets maybe. You realize there’s content outside of blabbing, right?
---
when Vulture and Damnation get buffer and Claymore and Eos get "local rep bonus"?
---
Thank you! I'm even moreso in real life because I CAN!
---
I had the 50k.. same problem :(
---
Hmmm got stuff to do. I'll do an ASSumer count later.
---
The krab king is dead. Long live the king!
---
Not meta has ever remained permanent dude.
---
Just goon things
---
The rogue drone 5/10 is the drone equivalent of a 10/10. Theres only 1/10 3/10 and 5/10 for drones iirc. Serpentis and I think Angels have no 5/10 too.
---
This whole thing is difficult to read. There are differences between WHERE, WERE, and WE'RE. Please learn them. I can deal with the occasional but multiple by multiple people make my brain hurt.
---
Olmeca Gold
---
Well then wtf are you trying to say
---
They'll probably end up fucking them up to where they're garbage at ratting and targeting subcaps tbh
---
DONT FUCKING SAY THE J WORD
---
Yeah, those guys with 47 accounts sure were providing content. /s
---
Well if you didn't have the info on the date this would happen at the time (because CCP never stated it) then you must have made an assumption at that time, no two ways about it. Unless you were privy to information the rest of us were not?
---
So me thinks you're full of utter shit.
---
Man I've been away for a good while I'd forgotten how tasty Eve salt is. Thanks for the reminder!
---
I hear theyre fun
---
Boo hoo just use a domi
---
That's exactly what the game needs. That's like saying they'll fuck up the US by creating solar jobs in the midwest.
---
Remember the one week periode between two patches where CCP changed some drone skills and the VNI with geckos had over 1000 dps? Fun times.
---
CAN SOMOENE TDLR WITHOUT THE RP?
---
They like to surprise you
---
I cannot watch movies while PvPing, FCs get a bit salty with my reaction times when i do. :)
---
personally I don't give a shit which space is safer, and I don't understand why anyone would. I want a WH because where it is in the universe shifts, so content refreshes. Sometimes that means I'm basically insulated and I'm safe and cozy. Othertimes I'm connected 3 ways to pure hell.
---
Ultimately the main difference between null and WH, is that wormholers run out of anoms and eventually have to leave their homes to crab.
---
nevah !
---
NS used to take more control of who enters and leaves, but once bubbles got decay people decided it was too annoying to deploy and redeploy them.
---
Myrms, Domi's, Ishtar's and Rattles from Cheapest -&gt; Most Expensive
---
Wow Classic hits in 3 weeks...just saying
---
What do you mean it’s shit? It says stable on the top that means it can tank.
---
Definitely see the good part of the changes, but I have to admit I'll kinda miss dual box ratting in my VNI's named "two in the pink" and "one in the stink."
---
This. I've been roaming Omist and Feythabolis in a bomber and a T3C. No way in fuck is it worth bringing a bomber wing 50 jumps out to here. The targets are too sparse and logistics too annoying to be worth it. Rather bring 4 or 5 sniper Tengu/Loki and just alpha what we can.
---
Ah thank you
---
July has a patch as well.
---
Mango
---
If you adjusted your overview, it would have spelled "Assass"
---
Also, it's not even funny.
---
Bubbles don't do shit against nullified ships, and some nullified ships have covert cynos.
---
Spoken like someone who plexs their accounts with isk. Otherwise like those who buy plex with real money, you would be grateful for high prices of plex.
---
Grath, you are the only woman for me.
---
And post title has crab flair, upvoting just cause of that!!!
---
Well old boosting Rorquals were barely used.
---
With all due respect, if Wingspan of all people are camping you, you don't belong in WH space.  
---
WDS is kind of like the Plecos that keep tanks clean.  They live off of scraps and leave the other fish alone, but will pounce on anything that can't fight back.  In my 3 years living in WHs, I've encountered WDS 4 times, each time it was Wingspan trying to fuck off and ended with a killmail for me and my mates.  Shit, I've taken Occators through B274's 2-3 jumps away from Jita and Amarr, knowing they're likely camped by Wingspan, and never saw a lick of them, not once.
---
They do camp people who can't really fight back, like your corporation.  They did it to a newbie WH corp, whose name I've forgotten, for something like 7 months.  They lived off an Orca and killed the idiots in the system whenever they half-assed something.
---
WH space is like prison.  If you show weakness, you'll be evicted.  If you show you at least know how to bloody someone's nose, even if you won't win the fight, you'll likely be left alone.
---
The VNI is dead, long live the VNI!
---
For that to apply you would need a date which they never gave you or anyone else. Stop being such a fucking baby
---
Use 12 Domi :P
---
In fact, do FW in Ventures to earn your 12 Domi for kicks and giggles.
---
What's more interesting is how a "noob" has access to r/Eve while having 0 idea how this game works...
---
I am such a fucking noob.
---
I started playing EVE like.... 8 years ago maybe?
---
I stumbled my way blindly into solo exploration, made every mistake at least once, then finally started making bank.
---
I then started a sub-community within a nooby corp using my survival knowledge to teach carebears how to avoid wardeccers by utilising wormholes, understanding tackling/locking mechanisms, cloaky bullshit, local abuse, perches, undocks etc.
---
Said sub-community eventually became its own corp, where we set up a multi-capability exploration supply chain. Scanners, scouts, haulers, hackers, PVPers, industrialists and marketers all working together to make profit and nobody doing a part of the job they hated.
---
We moved into W-Space and became the masters of our own domain. We defended our home from a few visitors, but were never evicted.
---
I became very active in Bombers Bar, FC'd a couple of times, I remember Nova Valentis' first fleet - he was so cute.
---
Stealth is in my blood. D-scan is my pulse.
---
Just came back to EVE after a 4ish year hiatus. Joined a BB fleet. Fitted the shit out of my bomber because I have those skills maxed, all races. Ready to be top damage on whatever whale we catch tonight. Formup took longer than I'd hoped and the beers, weed and sunshine cocktail had me nodding off in my chair so I logged out in the w-space staging system.
---
Logged back in the next day. Didn't bookmark the hole out.
---
ummm why wouldnt I? I just searched for an Eve online sub and found this. It doesnt take a genius to do that
---
It's not dead, it's just free to be speak its truth and be free from NPC catcalls and attempted groping.
---
Boooo
---
This is the problem.
---
Just ruining the game for short term profit.
---
Can't wait to build a brawler vni.
---
Domis are most effective. Most dps and best application due to bandwidth and fitting room
---
Training for something and then it getting nerfed? You must be new here.
---
People got wrecked by them. It was hilarious.
---
How can I get people motivated to do something not fun, but necessary?
---
Ok, Sell them and buy a Myrm BPO for long term profit :P
---
*VNI Burn*
---
AFK ratting in a Proteus? Where is this viable? 
---
Please be as specific as possible. System and anom type is needed so that I can get the dankest ticks.
---
I used to be in those shoes long ago. Hating on CODE. for blasting my barges my bits. But the more you learn about this game and the more you subjectively soak in all the bits, you come to realize that they are certainly not the only ones terrorizing PVEers, and its really a job that needs to be done. Lessons are learned, help is given, friends are made. And really, most of the guys that are doing these things would likely buy you a beer and teach you a thing or two (given the opportunity).
---
Another one not understanding that a healthy economy is a BALANCE, not a "maxxed out one side".
---
Just to prove you wrong, I sub (with CC) 3 Accounts since 2007 continously. I sell PLEX to aquire ISK ingame since their introduction. When the PLEX equivalent of 30d game time was at 500 Mio. ISK instead of over 2 Bil ISK I sold the same amoout of $ like today.
---
I cannot wait for this to come out. It will probably be my top welped ship. Getting a 7.5% rep bonus on such a cheap cruiser is going to be a dream for solo non-elite pvp.
---
Domis can do that same shit, more effectively. Doesnt take much longer to train into them
---
Does anyone else find it odd that CCP rushed this change? Last week they asked for input on it and now it has already been deployed. Did they want to get this out of the way before maybe rolling back the blackout, either fully or partially?
---
All we need now is a serpentis C3-A and C3-X equivalent
---
Sweet I’ll bring my healer, I have the Pithum-B set, Minmatar Spec. Just need 3 DPS and we may be able to beat the raid boss.
---
From one potato to another.
---
You know a game is shit when you have to go to reddit to try to find a group for things.
---
I bet a significant amount of US politicians would argue exactly that...
---
Yes because they’re designed to support smaller gangs without a dedicated logi wing. And that’s a good thing.
---
That, and they will be fucking scary for frigs and destroyers with all that tracking speed.
---
This is exactly the reason it needed to be changed.
---
Apollo56 my character name
---
I mean Reddit in general isn't new to hearing about Eve, such as subreddits for other mmos, and the subreddit name is short and simple to find. What surprises me more is how people find /r/evenewbies now that it got removed from the sidebar as far as I can tell.
---
Space is a big place man
---
The economy is perfectly healthy. Demand is high so prices are high. What is inherently unhealthy about this? 
---
It's unhealthy because back in the day 1 plex was 300 mil and now the equivalent is ~2 bil? Well back in the day a brand new car was $10k. Today brand new cars are $40-50k. I don't hear the same complaining though.
---
believe it or not a point works great too. Just keep it on the first rat in the FHub until he dies and you'll maintain aggro throughout.
---
Offer a big reward for it
---
You want it i want it ;)      
---
Many people don't know how much they want it.
---
No cyno, bigger chance that someone jump to different system.
---
 /o\
---
Caldari/Amarr always have been more on the buffer/fleet/logi side, same goes for Minmatar/Gallente with the self-repair/skirmish/small-gang.
---
Looking at ships like the Sleipnir, you really do not need to swap that local rep to resistance bonus to make them good fleet ships.
---
They removed the mining bonus for the drones?! What am I supposed to do now!
---
No but you get them to be able to use better fits.
---
Rarely, vast majority of them are afk unless you hold their pod until they come back there's hardly ever a salty reaction in local to savour
---
Autonomy mastery purpose
---
The three drivers for motivation.
---
Figure out how to describe the target goal of the not fun (usually fun or isk or etc)
---
Get the people to be reaaaaaaaly good at it.
---
It's a shame they never made another command and conquer game after CNC3
---
Depends on skills I guess, I can scan down anything in quick order with just a bonused ship and sisters probes. No modules or rigs required. 
---
I have a Probe with 12 killmarks, it just has 2 scrams, mwd, relic analyzer, and got them beating up on other people who got into the site before I did. A lot of people don't expect pvp Probe and fail to run. Only difference between it and an exploration Astero is the Astero warps cloaked and people expect it to fight.
---
The drone 5/10 and 10/10 are indistinguishable from each other until you enter them.
---
The main difference is the amount of NPCs you see inside and the overseer's effects that drop from them.
---
No, that is not inflation, inflation is specifically when the money supply is being inflated by access printing or generation and thus inflating the cost of things just simply because of the amount of money supply.  This is Mineral supply which is not the same thing.  AKA, Not Inflation.
---
So 1 shield 1 armor buffer ship and 1 shield 1 armor local rep ship. I don't see the issue here.
---
Maybe they are intended for different use? Why else would they give you 2 options for each race?
---
&gt; but we’re the ones you remember.
---
We remember the stupidity, not the gank.
---
As I said, many other people gank and nobody remembers them. What is remarkable is the amount of BS CODE. can exhibit.
---
Indeed, ganking is just fine. Nobody said the opposite.
---
No what this game needs is more variety, not dumbing every thing to flying in small ships .          
---
Try to roam in a battleship ... **why the hell you want to roam in a battleship if a fucking cruiser now can outtank you and there are destroyers with bigger DPS**
---
You are clearly missing the point.
---
You clearly do not have a point to miss.
---
Oh noes, something was deliveted ahead of schedule, for once.
---
*Construction complete. New construction options!*
---
did you look for an ingame channel? i bet there is one.
---
Yea just no luck right now
---
yaaaaaaaaaasssssssssss
---
What skills will be removed from alphas?
---
this \^\^ :D
---
They're both great but the timing severely hampers the authenticity of any statistical data they are trying to collect regarding the effect of null blackout and how many accounts log in.
---
Either way who cares, it just means the people that chose not to play the game because of the blackout, may log in once a day to kill a rat or 10 in belts and then log off. 
---
In essence, the data is totally roasted, we're getting fun fights that the risk averse roamers can't avoid, null sec pve is dead, blocs get bigger, shareholders are happy, every side is gaining something here! It's a win win for everyone
---
"If I get scrammed i'm going to die" as the site has scrams on it, so I was hoping I could warp before they aggroed me.
---
The depo is to refit to tank to start working through the site as normal.
---
WTF CCP my VNI mining fleet comp is now completely nerfed into the ground.
---
The tuned up version Goonswarm uses is pretty smooth.  The public version has alot more "bling" and also a higher usage amount/way more maps being accessed.
---
2poc cafe, for all your incursion needs
---
I feel you
---
Then what would be an appropriate response? 10 Titans? 1 Titan?
---
Dude, you're attacking the biggest/best mining ship in the game in the middle of their home turf. You want to kill that capital mining ship? Attack with an appropiate force. The PANIC mechanic isn't the problem, it's force imbalance.
---
Change capitals overpoweredness or change cynos so there's a limit on how much can respond, not PANIC. PANIC is doing exacly as it was designed to do and the design idea of it is great. Problem is that capital ships are just larger overpowered "normal" ships now.
---
Your story is exactly why this change is being put forward. If you don't understand why, maybe this game is trying to tell you something.
---
Well given that for 80M+ guys extractor provide 150k SP I'd say this event is for old boyz.
---
Lol I've been in nullsec for three years. Yeah it's more populated and yeah it has more pvp. But it's like dunking on toddlers in the wading pool.
---
More people in space......with a hs static
---
(ahem)[https://evescoutrescue.com/copilot/911/911.php](https://evescoutrescue.com/copilot/911/911.php)
---
Half the people in WINGSPAN view the game the way a sane person would view owning a terrarium.
---
You log in, look around. Look, the plants are having a beautiful day! Uh oh, this little plant is getting greedy and eating up all the ~~sleepers~~ sunlight. It needs to have a little bit of a trimming! SNIP!
---
Ah, so peaceful again. What a beautiful solar system.
---
Noice. Will check that out once I unflip my table and log back in.
---
Haha this is great. My mind also jumped to an episode of Star Trek Voyager, although it involves Amelia Earhart, it doesn't have to do with wormholes. xD
---
yes
---
Yeah no capitals need to be hammered back into structure bashing ships and certain subs need a rebalance
---
Ah, those were the days. Dual tanked with mixed guns.
---
Hey! We also camp wandering HS holes, not just the statics.
---
Evemon is updated?
---
 small gang will be all over the routes toward the front lines. (Good)
---
Solo will happen more often as the frontline widens onto all connected fronts... AFTER the initial push to get  your faction off the back foot.
---
You can't be forgetting how many systems still remain connected to hisec, even with 100% of lowsec controlled.
---
At some point, solo must also be recognised as the endgame of PvP as well. Unless you're a true masochist... Or an alt of a very skilled pilot.
---
A timetable not supported by facts.
---
But also, you know once the skill is not alpha anymore it stops being applied right?
---
You were going to spend weeks training skills that you'd never be able to use?
---
My mistake was thinking I *had* a mwd lol
---
Yeah I can't really see Rattles taking off due to how expensive they are. Maybe for active play, but definitely not AFK or botting ratting.
---
F’s in chat
---
Local: ffffffffvR
---
If you're alpha, you aren't a customer.
---
CCP sucks
---
The meta has officially shifted. Try the Myrmidon or Dominix. Same flavor, more EHP, and good god does the Myrmidon look sexy.
---
Today we lost an old friend.
---
It doesn't take a closer to still recognize that bots are significantly more at risk now than before, even with updates bot coding.
---
&gt;  anyone else find it odd that CCP rushed this change? Last week they asked for input on it and now it has already been deployed. Did they want to get this out of the way before maybe rolling back the blackout, either fully or partially
---
It'll be rolled back but I hope to god they don't make it like it was. If they set up local so that a new person jumping in had a few minute timer where they didn't show but also couldn't see anyone else in local, I'd be happy with the compromise.
---
They announced a change, throughout explained the change and Enacted the change.
---
And that is pissing you off?
---
The mobile app is key.
---
Imagine the number of casuals who would put in farmore hours if they could update their PI wihle at work during lunch.
---
Lowering the albedo of the planet and increasing global warming!? No thanks I'll still to coal.
---
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vassal
---
A vassal state is more akin to how BoT is to NC.
---
As for French ConneXion. It is not a NIP, it's something else. Our NIPs stay white because they are as stated only Non-Invasion Pacts, not Non-Aggression Pacts.
---
"UNGH"
---
I guess, if "improvise" is code for "whine on Reddit".
---
amamake top belt
---
Might be, just seemed an odd coincidence that I did it exactly 12 hours before DT.
---
Code? You mean those blinky reds I see once in a while on high sec gates near Jita shooting at iterons? High sec is a scary place
---
I work with clients running 8 figure businesses and none of them are this stupid.
---
Pretty sure he was being sarcastic.
---
*"Rust?"*
---
That's probably because they don't sit around in their mum's basements jerking off.
---
&gt; So it makes them much less efficient for going afk in.
---
If your not afk, the gun bonuses and repping even out the drone nerfs, right?
---
What's that plan? To....omega?
---
So you planned to omega later? Just omega now and you'll also finish the training sooner with less micro managing.
---
But also what the fuck does your one bank have to do with anything?
---
Probably because he has so many that none will be successful.
---
Still 500 drone dps
---
That's the episode, yeah!
---
Wow such cool, this game was so boring before this amazing next level content.
---
I have but a single question:
---
Sometime during 2017, did you join a corp called Naval Defence Force out in Immensea and did you get kicked after another player put a bounty on you and you insisted that made the rats more dangerous, and that you knew this because you had a special computer with drafting hardware?
---
You sound just like someone I used to know.
---
Triglav defense -I've flown a few fleets with these guys, good group.
---
Yes. That is the most hilarious part about all of this.
---
Yes they will still be making money, but now with more ffort and more risk.
---
That's the entire point
---
Yes, his fit is not very optimal if we can say so
---
**YES!**
---
In game channel "triglav defense" they are more active then any others I've found.
---
#F
---
&gt; Try to roam in a battleship
---
I want to do it again. Bring back RRBS fleets and I will die happy. In game of course.
---
What toys?
---
Carrier? carrier are holy shit with the blackout, you cant compete with a small gang that know to play in a carrier because of the fighter mechanic.
---
Even better, deliver early.
---
No need to stand outside with their package just because it's ready faster than you projected.
---
New plan took 1 minute and a whole lot of bitching.
---
yeah that was the inital plan ... but we all know what happend
---
1. Warp to Forsaken Hub/Rally
---
2. Lock all rats
---
3. Point one, wait for all rats to redbox you
---
4. Launch Drones, engage rats, drop point when they start engaging
---
i haven't had any aggro on my heavies using this method
---
On dreads, Supers, and Tits, yeah. Carriers were never really structure bashers. I wouldn't mind going back to the old carriers, though. I think they ought to be the only cap that can reliably apply to subs.
---
It was only 11m.
---
I lost a 9b jump freighter because of a half second hesitation and bad planning.
---
If you want your 11m back, I can give it to you
---
Hey, man, you don't know him. He owns businesses! He can generate a whole $0.05 in wealth in that minute, but instead he has to spend it removing a dead skill from his queue! Basic MBA Tip right there!
---
No stop my Dominix Navy Issue can only get so erect!
---
take a myrm it will be almost the same
---
I told you, all moon goo is filed under Item 163 and the property of management.
---
I lost a 9b blockade runner because I didn't use an instadock in Jita. They had tornadoes just blasting BRs that landed outside the docking ring
---
How pathetic that is....lol. 
---
Keep it up, who laughs last, laughs best :)
---
Meta seems to be the auto-targeter, actually. Using it on the VNI made rats pretty much ignore your drones.
---
Do you remember the notification that told you your safety couldn't be guaranteed in lowsec when you tried to jump the gate?
---
If you land a crit you land at the camp and automatically dd the enemy fleet upon loading grid.
---
Oh right, I forgot you can't cyno in NPC Null.... oh wait
---
Almost true, if you add the lines "Fuck lowsec" , "Fuck highsec" and "free skills for everyone" to boost login numbers then you will be more accurate with CCP's plan for the future.
---
Nanogang exists, he screamed into the void.
---
Cute.
---
You can't run wormhole sites in carriers lol what are you talking about. Go take like 3 Nyxes into a C6 site on sisi and see what happens.
---
Good joke
---
I remember 3 years ago when i started eve in Goon, they advice me this brave VNI to make ISK.
---
Fly it during one years before being able to use cap.
---
Wont use it in pve anymore but it will be so good for pvping now.
---
Good bye my old pve friend. Welcome my new pvp friend :)
---
Haha
---
Here's mine: https://zkillboard.com/character/1813040573/

---
Alphas can no longer train:
---
Heavy Drone Op IV
---
Medium Drone Op  V
---
Drone Interfacing IV
---
This is targetted at botters.
---
Potentially. Probably rails+drones would be ideal so youre not chasing rats around trying to get in range with blasters.
---
Except in the CCP official lore

Nope. Had never heard of EVE in 2017, I was into COD at the time.

Sleeper caches can be further away than 4 AU. But yes, all others are within 4 AU and Sleeper caches are a bit rare (if you even want to run them).
---
your optimism should be sold in a bottle.  
---
wonder what'd you say if i cut your right arm   
---
would it be something like "it's better to masturbate with the off-hand since the neural links are weak it'll give more plasure"?  
---
or something more in the line of "i already have one spare"?
---
Yeah, using "ewar" in a pretty broad sense here -- that tracks with what I recall hearing.
---
Terminal spodbrain.
---
&gt;small gang will be all over the routes toward the front lines. (Good)
---
No. There would be no point since there is nothing to plex, but in the unlikely case this is true, they will get caught in camps all the time until they stop being there.
---
&gt;Solo will happen more often as the frontline widens onto all connected fronts... AFTER the initial push to get your faction off the back foot.
---
No. The entire plex mechanic would be destroyed (a lot of solo happens there).
---
&gt;You can't be forgetting how many systems still remain connected to hisec, even with 100% of lowsec controlled.
---
Not sure how that matters.
---
&gt;At some point, solo must also be recognised as the endgame of PvP as well. Unless you're a true masochist... Or an alt of a very skilled pilot.
---
There is a difference between having a design that is hostile to solo because no one took it into consideration and a design that deliberately destroys solo and small gang in favor of blobs.
---
NSH has been renting out the WIX pocket for a month and only now goons are stopping it. They were the best rental lords in eve.
---
I was looking forward to this buff
---
And those foolish ratters will be *giving them away!*
---
Depends. I do think they pack the biggest punch for small ships, so it’s something to think about.
---
I consider them a bit OP as they can basically do three things greatly with a single fit, with the Modes scheme. Defense let them tank like a cruiser with the signature near frigate’s, Sharpshooter let them deal great DPS way longer ranges and Propulsion just transform them in a travel fit ceptor, and sometimes even better (Hecate with bellow one second align time).
---
You can have my upvote
---
&gt; Had to sell the athanor to wingspan
---
You got scammed.
---
&gt;On a couple of occasions we tried to leave and as soon as we mentioned moving peoples stuff out. There were 2-3 wingspan people online and at our high sec waiting with a bubble.
---
This is pretty easy to isolate spying.
---
Sounds like a you problem to me, lol.
---
I don't undock for less than 100k sp.
---
Yeah, they don't get it. All trying to explain to me about the meta and asking if I am new...yet they forgot the utmost important thing about Eve and Reddit...sarcasm. FYI: 2007 player with billions of ISK, Titan on its way, multiple fax pilots etc. Anywho.... :)
---
32 days actually.   But who's counting?
---
Selling doterra doesn't count as owning a business.
---
and with some -5 or -10B tick.
---
You could fool me.
---
Please, enlighten us.
---
Pap links are cake.
---
VNI is alive!
---
So you are pushing people to the blob so we can have a stalemate like nullsec? Good idea.
---
&gt;The data on player rentntion indicates that a newbro soloing in Eve is already headed for biomass.
---
Because all the other newbros have been pushed to join a corp and they see there is no choice because all the other newbros joined a corp, etc.
---
That was soo pre injector days.
---
Scoots, out of all people I never expected you to fall for the sarcasm my dude. Been using Sappo's domi fitting for over half a year.
---
Praxis can rat just as well as a VNI.

I have already read all the relevant Triglavian trinary data streams as well as item descriptions, and at most they just tell of hostile relations between the Second Jovian Empire and the Triglavians. So what exactly is the evidence you're talking about that the Triglavians are indisputably Jovian?
---
I did. I didn't take...didn't expect it would really...
---
Obviously.
---
'fun'
---
Little bit at a time, till one day you long in and you can't buy a new toon for cash with X amount of SP - the more you pay the more SP. One step at a time. It's a plan, maybe the only "plan" CCP has ever had.
---
Some plan.
---
Good luck with that.
---
I using version 4.0.12 (64bit) on Windows 10 and it's working fine.   At least for tracking skill queues... which is about all I use it for.
---
surprise all your vni bots are dead
---
Frigates and destroyer? Fucking thing spits out 670 DPS with a 600 DPS tank, it'll eat cruisers for breakfast haha
---
you forgot the part where every patch the last decade have been buffing null
---
For a second there you sounded so much like CCP that I actually thought you were CCP... then I realized that having a game released on any platform isn't something that CCP can actually do.
---
hey look! Its a retard!
---
Chart with Jovian\Sleeper\Drifter relationship was featured on the presentation at one of the last events on their World Tour, can't remember which one right now.
---
The crosstrain to Ishtar is not much longer
---
&gt;I don't know if I agree or disagree, but I will say that it has been near impossible as a new character to find fights in my little T1 frigate.
---
The reason is basically circular. New players cant find other new players because all new players "need" to join a corp, so they either join a corp or quit. This has been going on for years. The result is as you see it.
---
Players joining corporations and forming blobs raises the barrier to entry for new players and those who choose to be solo. It is bad for the game.
---
&gt;Could I just get a fair 1v1 fight? If I log in every day and just spend my time orbiting a Plex and avoiding superior ships in a novice site, is this the game?
---
Yes. It is what happens when balance and (bad) design are neglected for years.
---
lmao wtf
---
And no Triglavians. Link it then.
---
You could make a really awesome mobile game that ties into the main game.  Build a colony, grow to multiple colonies, raid other colonies with colony based frigates that can be intercepted in EVE.
---
Whoop, there it is.
---
Storytime? This sounds juicy.
---
Next time before you start talking about things you do not know, think twice.
---
Forest fires do not reinvigorate the forest soil. it burns all the useful organic material and destroys the ecosystem of the forest.  
---
That thing you wrote makes you sound like a Highsec Miner who developed a Stockholm Syndrome for his gankers.
---
There is no Sin in your Thoughts
---
For a SP capped alpha, med drones 5 is alot of time and SP just to go yellow. I am not complaining, but I understand feeling frustrated.
---
Versus just jumping straight on to citadels?
---
I'd like a "challenge" involving characters that don't have any SP in gunnery, missiles or drones.  You know, industry characters.  That's why I enjoyed doing the race.  Shooting stuff is extremely gay imho.
---
lol wut?
---
What a surprise.
---
Post deleted because it didn't concern anyone! =D

Just pod yourself... stupid Goon Bitch.

Actually, I'm left-handed so there wouldn't be too significant of a change. I'm sure I could manage just fine in day-to-day situations.
---
Myrms are quite effective due to insurance + an hour making you isk positive
---
&gt;Lol I've been in nullsec for three years.
---
One would think that you would have outgrown the infantile "my space is better than your space" stuff, if that's really the case. I guess I'll have to take your word for it though.

I don't need to. The truth stay the truth with or without me stating it.

High-severity wildfire creates complex early seral forest habitat (also called “snag forest habitat”), which often has higher species richness and diversity than unburned old forest.[6] Plant and animal species in most types of North American forests evolved with fire, and many of these species depend on wildfires, and particularly high-severity fires, to reproduce and grow. **Fire helps to return nutrients from plant matter back to soil**, the heat from fire is necessary to the germination of certain types of seeds, and the snags (dead trees) and early successional forests created by high-severity fire create habitat conditions that are beneficial to wildlife.[6] Early successional forests created by high-severity fire support some of the highest levels of native biodiversity found in temperate conifer forests.[7][82] Post-fire logging has no ecological benefits and many negative impacts; the same is often true for post-fire seeding.[19]
---
Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire#Ecology
---
Obviously not all forest fires are beneficial as the next paragraph suggest. It depends on the frequency severity and other factors according to the article.
---
This is fucking brilliant. How do we get this to CCP Falcon??

REEEEEEEEE!
---
There was a time you knew nothing of EVE.
---
Yes, yes there was. 
---
And even *then*, I wasn't this clueless.
---
I have a better idea. Let's shut down tranquility for ever and you dont have to worry about your tiny Corp not being able to fight a 5000 man alliance toe to toe.
---
All the problems everyone cries about would suddenly be gone just like that.
---
Yes, because it looks like Dr Seuss and Babylon 5 had a fuck baby. Hate it and the helios
---
Remember I mentioned I'm 99th percentile in a lot of things? Intellect as well. First tested and prove before age 10. How 'bout you?
---
This was actually the line of thinking they had in making DUST 514 - the nail in the coffin was that they made it PS3 exclusive and so barely had enough players in it to handle a single region. You'd get bonuses based on what you could control in it.
---
The UI was also confusing as hell for the game.
---
Please god no. 
---
Don't make eve safer.
---
Hi,
---
My friend and I are trying to put together a small fleet of alts for a blops gang.  Here is how we sre setup:
---
My alt #1:  covert cyno in a covert ops frig
---
My main#1:  blops bridge
---
Friends 3 accounts are all bombers.
---
My first thought was to bridge the bombers and jump in behind with the blops, but now I am wondering if the blops should stay home and my friend drops a T3C and 2 bombers instead?
---
Also, should the bombers be polarized for these hit and run style things?
---
Any advice would be great, very new to this style of play.
---
but why is shooting pve ships content.
---
Brilliant. But to make it better the mis jumped ships will enter traffic control, and one at a time will cyno into the middle of the nearest 150+ man gang. As one dies, the next one exits traffic control to land on the wreck of the previous one. This continues until the last capital/super exits traffic control. 
---
There, you get easy free kills without having to do more than lock the next target. Fair ?
---
Don’t know why you got downvoted for that, it’s going to be a pure beast for brawls
---
I have only vague memories since this was two years ago but I distinctly recall during my time as industry lead there was a dispute between two members where Person A stole some ratting bounties off of Person B without knowing it, Person A being new to the game. Person B then did the passive-aggressive thing and put a bounty on Person A, which caused the situation to escalate.
---
We ended up kicking Person B a few days later because he was just being super passive-aggressive with everyone and not really interacting positively with anyone, but Person A was much more entertaining. He started complaining that the rats he encountered were more powerful than normal and claimed that this was because of the bounty on him.
---
Bear in mind that his main method of communication was long-form paragraphs with no punctuation that read like a giant stream of consciousness. He would write these massive dissertations on every single point, it was exhausting to read. Whenever someone tried to tell him that no, bounties didn't work like that, he would claim that his computer was some sort of special drafting computer with special hardware that let him see code that wasn't visible to everyone else, and that this let him know that the bounty on him made the rats more powerful. Either that, or that his special drafting computer was why that mechanic supposedly existed. One or the other, it's honestly hard to tell.
---
A running joke among leadership after that was that if we'd have put a few million on him he'd be facing multiple titan rats every time he undocked.
---
That's adorable.
---
....Um, you do know it's coded to only appear when there are enough people running sites right?
---
They don't want you being sent into that arena to wait and wait and wait and wait...
---
Should have used the uno reverse card mate.
---
Dont think t2 ship bpcs should appear out of thin air. Depending on drop rate, it could actually hurt data site loot values if less decryptors are needed.
---
I do agree they should drop 1 run pirate module bpcs (green loot) and the mats to make them.
---
Id also like to see them drop COSMO/storyline bocs and mats. The cosmo/storyline items have a not of potential, but are just as expensive as faction, but give the same stats as t2.
---
They should be the pricier option when you only need fitting, but not directly competing with faction mods.
---
I don't think their only statistical instrument is the login count. They can probably see the number of hours you were connected, number of rats and players killed,...
---
Normal peoples brains make the corrections in real time and move on. You have a disease called grammar nazi - a debilitating condition that makes reddit cancer.
---
Lie to them and tell them you're doing something else, then after your formed and moving day that the content didn't come through because the enemy is risk averse bitches afraid to lose ships, but while you're out you might as well do X! The nullsec key to success

Does anyone actually still run COSMOS sites?

TL:DR RC was bottom feeding Provi, but they fucked up. RC biting off more they could chew hit the I-WIN button by dropping almost two dozen supers and titans knowing Provi had nothing to counter Supers and Titans.
---
Guy is missing some brain cells or just likes getting pegged.
---
Insanely powerful in small gangs and solo
---
weak in fleet settings, but not useless.
---
Not at this rate. Provi is like a frog in pot full of water slowly being turned up to spoiling point.
---
If i recall correctly, there are some static sites that people camp/farm all day for mats and maybe bpc drops, but its certainly not a large number of people.
---
Claymore, sleipnir, Eos and Astarte are all EXTREMELY strong in small gang settings, and they have a resist profile by default that allows them to buffer tank as well.
---
An Astarte can very comfortably take on any battleship in the game with its local rep power and dps.
---
More accurately the cancer is the inability to spell simple words and use proper grammar.
---
Sure, but I think you missed my point. I predict that if you do this and publicize it in any way, you'll get a couple people interested in *joining you*. (Not you joining them.)

What you've described is inflation from increase of money supply, but inflation can also happen from decrease of supply, since inflation is defined as an increase in the general price level. Minerals go into almost everything, so an increase in mineral prices will result in the overall cost of everything increasing, and decreasing the purchasing power of the isk.
---
One of the drivers of the inflation in the 70's is due to the arab oil embargo, which raised the cost of oil, and thus the cost of everything that relies on oil (read, everything).
---
&gt; A Frontline is the only way to add Geography that is significant to the Warzone.
---
It's just explicit.  Consider that GMVA lives in nullsec and starts warzone pushes in Alsavoinan.  It's our frontline.  By the time you include all edges, you're talking about half the warzone being contestable at all times.
---
The goal of your proposal is some conflict focusing &amp; interesting new plex resources.  Neither of these things require an explicit front line.  That's why I don't support the concept.
---
As far as mining, resources, see the discussion on moon mining &amp; tying facwar space moons to facwar.  It's tricky to get a design going that won't lead to obvious abuse of mechanics by those who want to moon mine.  I need to spend more time on it.
---
Thanks for the patch notes.
---
Only at point blank range, it’s going to be pretty easy to just kite
---
less noticeable = not public aka whitelist docking only. so it only shows up in the overview (window) if you are in a certain range to it.
---
its still visible with the station browser and/or in the game window overview if you have the stations active tho.
---
I think what we really need, is a game like Gwent, but in EVE. I spent more hours in Gwent than I did killing monsters in the Witcher..
---
My stream and corporation host nearly daily Invasion fleets and my in game channel hosts all of my armor Invasion fits.
---
Stealth may be your best friend on this. Rather than having ships in that system, despite it being empty, perhaps park them next door, and ninja anchor the citadel without alerting anyone in a timezone that is quiet for that area of space.
---
You shouldn't even need to form for the first 15 minute window that way, and will only need to cover it on it's exit.
---
Chances are it will get anchored and set up without incident, but if a bigger fish sees you are actively using it, and they want to provoke a fight, they may RF it anyway, so be prepared for that journey.
---
Carrier fighter application has been nerfed, so you may want to bring along webs on your tacklers, and perhaps a TP or so, to improve the damage application a little. But as others have suggested, the carrier is a massive "I am here look at me" waving flag.
---
Git Reked goonie!
---
We (mostly) do Falcon!
---
Now I want to see how far you have buffed the VNI, that thing looks like a PVP god now, really excited about it.
---
My biggest point of advice: be picky with your targets due to lack of numbers. And due as such, you probably don't need to drag your battleship with. Start small, get comfortable, then run big. The rest is really just point of style.
---
My most fun and terrifying adventures start with those words.
---
Never ran reactions but can tell you if your structure is full power and no one else lives in the hole pretty unlikely to be killed. Also, you say C1 at the cost of logistics, but I assume you want to be able to roll your HS easily right? if you live in a c3 its a 5B hole requiring quite a few battleship passes in comparison to 2 yachts on a c1.
---
About what?
---
Auto-targeter is urban legend level bullshit. Does nothing for aggro. I tested it extensively with VNI last year there was no difference whatsoever.

Wait this isn’t RuneScape...

Instead just a "good job" will do

Oh, on one condition. All Amarrian ships have the option to combine their grouped laser beams to better resemble a [void ray](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starcraft/images/c/c8/VoidRay_SC2_Art1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140601020113).
---
IF you have the cash to burn (P2W)...
---
So making capitals apply better to subcaps helps that? Huh?
---
'free'
---
Off course we do ... :-)
---
Yea, those are still good bonuses. Thing is going to active tank like a mini deimos - but have crazy good drone and turret dps. Its going to brawl really hard for its size and cost.
---
You're...familiar with what the albedo of subtropical deserts usually is, right? It's not ice. It's much higher, check the math. :)
---
lmao, get out of your basement

On the contrary, UAT is standard practice.
---
Back in like '07 my buddy said it looked like C3PO in bondage gear
---
I agree with you categorically - my issue was that the marketing was a bit over hype "Kill as many as you can on the awesome killing spree event!" ... and by "as many as you can" we mean just 1 every 24 hours
---
The actual humans who do this are in the single digits.

Good for Ronin but always talk in local once the fighting starts :P

Underrated comment, should be the bottom line to his posts.

Trolls will greatly miss the L33T pvp fleets and masterful doctrines TSC uses! And once we figure out how to counter your OP Torp Skorp doctrine maybe our FCs will find the balls to fight you!
---
This a very awesome story actually. Thanks for sharing!
---
Bridge your bombers in without the blops. Putting your ticket home on the field isn't a great idea, and it's expensive. The whole idea is to throw low cost bombers at expensive targets, not throw fragile and expensive things at tanky expensive things.
---
anchor, assign drones, done.
---
coming from a Vexor :P
---
Here's a hint:   If you have to tell someone how smart you are....
---
Oh, nevermind.
---
Thanks for the reply. Yes the logistics comment was in relation to low sec, though I didn't consider ease of rolling the static. Good to know that it probably wouldn't get bothered in a C1 though.
---
Oh so \*\*\*that's\*\*\* what the Auto-Targeter was for, to trick the rat targeting AI into thinking you have electronic support systems and are thus a more important threat
---
Neat
---
Sorry if my first langauge is not your first language.

I'm not too familiar with the whitelist range- how far does it have to be to not show on the overview if set to private?

Are you still laughing? I am ...

OOPS! Carrier just dropped on your VNI it's dead now!

This story was amazing, thank you

You came to my home, we have no obligation to be fair/fun. Meet me in catch and I am happy to brawl it out. If I came to your home, I’d expect nothing less.
---
What is Delve?
---
The only cruisers I know much about is T3Cs and they'd shrug that off and fist it hard in the anus. It wouldn't be able to catch an orthrus or many other kitey cruisers.
---
The thing is, you hear it either way. Some people swear it does something, others swear it doesn't. I say, it might do something and if you have a spare high you might as well.
---
I think it's more a case of repeatedly raising your threat by repeatedly re-targeting them over and over.

Yes you can make good isk in a barge but you can make better isk in a rorqual with excavators. He is right that literally no one wants to sit in a belt and watch others mine just to have 3 bombers decloak and do a bomb run on all the barges with no ability to help unless they have a defender launcher. At some point, the effort isn’t worth the money.
---
Ah yeah, Polio and luck. Lovely combo.

I can confirm, they are indeed

Let's just say I'm not looking to go ratting in a capital ship🤔
---
Like I said..I enjoy telling the truth because of the reactions it gets..like yours.
---
I'm from the South. We don't have basements.
---
iirc you have to be practically on grid, so don't worry about that. you won't fool the experienced folks since they'll find your structure on the probe scan window no matter how far it is, but it still helps against the inattentive.

CCP launching an expansion out of nowhere
---
This.  
---
I also felt as an aside, CCP could use older models and make a RTS base doff the 'Great War' before the Pod pilots came ot eve.  Have amar vs min, then add a cladari and gal expantion, leading up the the Jove slaughtering everyone and the Yuli convetion.
---
But your idea of a RTS for plant conquest sounds like a ton of fun
---

Honestly they should have just left that for memes.

There are 4 cases I've seen for Wormhole evictions
---
1. Low-power structure target of opportunity
---
2. Inner Hell
---
3. Two groups actually hate each other enough that one wants to obliterate the other \[this one's pretty rare\]
---
4. A ***really*** incredibly shitty excuse
---
Yeah. Excuses are a thing. But they're a bit less common, in part because of the personnel and dedication it takes to pull a several day long hellcamp.
---
At the time of Dust announcement, in 2009, there was a bunch of FPS shooters on console.  It was smart of CCP to try and tap into the market.  
---
The issue, though, is i think dust took way longer then they planed, and they made a not so good fps.  They should of ported it to pc quickly, but failed.  
---
From a business sense, tapping into the PS3 was brilliant.. from a practical sense.. not so much.
---
You can deliver out of safety to another account and bypass the fee?  I doubt thats true but if it’s Then you disable that.  
---
No you wouldn’t restrict this to alphas only lol.  They have nothing of value compared to omegas.  That’s just dumb. 
---
None of what you posted makes any sense.  #2 is exactly what I suggested. #3 is just stupid.  You wouldn’t discern between a delivery hangar and their item/ship hangars.  Everything of the player goes into a cooler for 90 days from the omega end date or the last login in any status of alpha or omega.  Most likely that would require a prompt up front at character selection to evaluate assets and decide if you want to move them to unlockable.  So basically when you login and have available assets to pull out of safety (90 days has passed) the game says “hey you had this shit from this place that blew up... want it?” And you’d say yeah and it moves it off to a canister in safety that can be withdrawn into the low sec system once you pay the fee.  (not unlike how rewards are delivered)
---
You entered an area of space called low security space (low sec for short). It's basically a pirate invested land. Anytime you go there, you can be fully engaged by anyone at anytime without much repercussions. So don't go there until you know what you're doing.
---
Suggest you find some newbie friendly corporation to teach you EVE so you don't make the same mistake again. Also that's a horribly fit Moa you were flying. Don't even fly that fit again.
---
They started unanchoring their fort as a meme. Accidentally unanchored it for real after forgetting to cancel. A bunch of people awoxxed the guy who did this, then spent 6 hours recovering all the loot safely
---
Thanks for that 2 lined proof that you know nothing about economic systems and their global functions
---
I have a small corp, that used to be big but is kinda dead due to IRL stuff (15 year sin this bloody game will do that)
---
The past 5 or so years i have been in WH's.  Each time i usually get an eviction threat around 6 months in, and don;t actually get tossed till 1 year in.  Honestly, most of the time in WH's you just worry about getting ganked.
---
Do you have to go back and scoop it 7 days later or can you immediately unanchor and scoop?
---
Found OP's alt account
---
As if they would last long enough to find out. But yes, it would be hilarious to see their reaction when they see a fleet of ships on par with the SSD being pumped out every month.
---
The OP gives no shits about any reactions including upvotes or downbotes beyond you lot continuing to amuse and entertaining him. With the exception that the OP is pleased that someone completely accidentally revealed something very useful to him! I'm sure it would burn, if that responder realized it was him who inadvertently served me well.

We all know there's one guy in each one behind a curtain controlling it. Much like the wizard of oz.
---
Dark is a good CEO and a kind man and generously left out the worst part of the op, which was the failure of the FC to get back into the target hole.
---
So after getting rolled out I scampered back to HS and my guy Belko starts looking for another entrance. He's scanning and scanning and all the while comms is blowing up because of the shit going on at the athanor and I'm sitting outside like "yeah!... cool... yay..."
---
Eventually home dog finds an entrance but it's in Amarr LS. He'd found another earlier that was some 30 jumps away, so I figured this one (a mere 8) would be my best shot. I ask one of the dudes in fleet to scout the way in so I would be covered and head that way. 
---
The rest gets hazy - I vaguely remember asking if the chain was good and the guy leading me in affirmed, but the guy leading me in was also the logi anchor so he may have just been logi anchoring. tl;dr: jumped into a gatecamp and got my [shit pushed in.](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77787926/)
---
I did eventually get back into the hole in an atron, which was almost immediately popped when I stopped paying attention to fortizar aggro to zoom in real close and check out killmarks on a domi. Then Windows 10 decided to do its thing and I dc'd. All the while my corpmates are killing a phoenix.
---
rip
---
it could be considered a buff tbh
---
"Trolling" implies I give a shit about the reaction one way or the other.
---
I can confirm this as the proper method.
---
That's..never mind...
---
Kill rats (NPC pirates).
---
The auto-targeter absolutely does jack shit now. It is a myth.
---
Auto-targeter does absolutely zero. Use a long point.
---
Was my punctuation faulty? That rarely happens...but I'm multi tasking and this is extremely low on the flow stack.
---
C1s and C2s are absolutely without issues. No one is gonna bash a random structure unless someone pays them to do so. However I highly recommend setting up in a system in which dscan from your station will cover each celestial.
---
It's a myth.
---
So if you get a wormhole with a lowsec static you have little odds of people coming in and the few jumps through lowsec will harden you.
---
Highsec. have a lot of random annoying visitors trying to take the crap sites and is overall annoying if you want to be lowkey.
---
Some corps been doing that since forever.
---
J144316 isn’t available through the system search.
---
The Amar equivalent still has mining bonus.
---
The new VNI will probably be great for Abyssals
---
Wasn't calling you out specifically. Just an in general annoyance with the thread as a whole.
---
rattlesnakes have been extremely popular among botters for years in the drone lands
---
&gt;Dark is a good CEO and a kind man and generously left out the worst part of the op, which was the failure of the FC to get back into the target hole.
---
Real smoooooth :P
---
give it 10x mass and remove everything else
---
make it a fucking bowling ball you know what i am saying
---
VNI is dead, long live the VNI
---
This is the TEST-approved procedure.
---
And that's why y'all keep dying to tornados.
---
no it was the levi over caldari prime
---
That sounds really handy! I've not heard of your site but I'll check it out now.
---
Speak for yourself, it was *pretty got dang rough* for your boy.
---
*Laughs in kite rail/drone nano vni*
---
This thing will be the new Nomen mark my words.
---
Incorrect. You need a town called Gila.
---
How much isk is in circulation now compared to when a plex was 300 mil for 1 30 day subscription. About 700 trillion more
---
Maybe what we need to do is change eve to a command economy like you are used to from the Soviet Union. That way we can control production, the money supply and can manipulate prices through over supply or famine.
---
Ishtar and Gila were always cooler!
---
My bad. I already rented the town tho. Who can we fly there now? Mjonir Bloc?
---
Haha it was a series of unfortunate events that you experienced
---
You know you've played too much eve when you start searching for spaceships in Google Maps :)
---
100% of which occurred because the night before I didn't just fix my shit and get in. I figured I could get some slumber and get in in the morning but whoops oh no that was not good.
---
I didn't search for it. I just played geoguessr and right next to a place i searched caracal plopped up.
---
I've noticed that trait in many people with low self-esteem.
---
I always said if they do a mobile game, it should be planetside.
---
I live in a C2 with a HS &amp; C3 Statics. Welcome to join me and put down a structure. I let another guy join me and its been fine so far. Has his own citadel to dock and goes about his own business. Only thing I ask is we all help out should someones structure(s) need defending
---
The rumor is they fixed that today, haven't gotten home yet to test
---
Uuuh wait a second, now it has THREE bonuses? Including two damage bonuses and one tanking bonus?
---
Isn't this actually a beast of a ship now?
---
I stand corrected (though inflation is most often attributed to money supply increase as that usually has the most effect), but an increase in mineral prices to what they were before is still a general good thing.  As well, we do not want to change cap production items to something different from minerals as that would hurt the economy more than it is currently.
---
Do you know a store that has a free give-away action on weekend? I would like to go there and complain about the products I enjoy for free ...
---
Have you tried turning it on and off again
---
Can't wait to see everyone's PvE shitfits
---
Same. I had a nice sniper fit for it using sentry drones.
---
Yes, pls halp
---
Your best bet is submitting a ticket and having a support agent help you out. Tell them the whole story and provide proof it's actually yours.
---
Whether you do it all at once or in bursts has no bearing on the amount you can make. You’re capped by the respawn rate if sigs, which is fucking painfully slow.
---
Your best bet tbh would be rorq mining - but you can’t get T2 ore in w-space other than coesite, which is hot garbage that you can’t export because it can’t be compressed. And you can’t really export capitals because you can fit no more than three through a C140. So you’re stuck with exporting compressed ore as your sole option.
---
bruh rep bonus is amazing
---
That's what I'm in the process of doing. However from googling I know this sort of thing requires investigations and certainly time. During that time I'm just going to be anxious waiting for a response from CCP. I'm trying to better find out if I'm doomed, or has anyone else been through the same but had a grateful outcome.
---
Nowhere that point where I live.
---
Lol yeah :/ maybe they should just give him a lowsec gate to stain so he’ll go away lmao
---
No, you're just an *incredible* retard.
---
Except the VNI is still actually good, just not good at afk ratting
---
Give him a lowsec gate to Stain, but when activated it biomasses his character, deletes his Reddit account, and bricks his computer.
---
So I handle a good portion of the saves in delve, I know exactly how these things really go. Plenty of people get inhibed even when paying attention. I don’t understand why hunters think killing our biggest ships should be just as easy as killing a VNI. Expensive kills should not be easy. When I got to other people’s space, I don’t expect anything easy and just have fun even if we don’t kill targets we find
---
Abyss PVP peace piece of ~~shit~~ dead content. 3-5 guys fight from whom ~~longer penis~~ more expensive fit and kill some randome carebears.
---
Yeah, back when bots could watch local and safe up whenever there were wolves about. 
---
Now the risk of loss is very real.
---
Now that was slightly amusing :)
---
Why do subcaps HAVE to be used? Get over it, we have capitals and we will use them. We have no obligation to use fucking subcaps when you attack us
---
I think the CODE. hate is around the "savior of high-sec" roleplay stuff honestly
---
That is fucking gold, thanks for the video.
---
You are a fucking idiot.
---
Hmm nobody's tried psychobabble in a while. Let me guess. Californian?
---
You taught me everything in retarding.
---
He was reinforcing common knowledge with a source. Shouldn't even need to.
---
You seem like a chap that keeps a calm demeanor when things don't go your way. What part of new Eden can we find these omega/alpha characters of yours? Would love to stop by and say 'hello'. o7
---
This has been the proper way to use drones since CCP made the aggro changes years ago.
---
But it has more than two steps so people find it literally unplayable
---
Shit if they are killing they are probably skilling.  That son of a bitch who stole your account probably trained triglavian ships too for you the bastard.
---
They can't multi-task. Hell, if you aren't one, you couldn't do specific the multi-tasking I do. Only about 4% of the entirety of humanity can.
---
Great price too, now that botters are liquidating them!
---
wow this idea was brought on by the devs 2 years ago, right before I quitted Eve (or so I thought). Guess there's some lag in iceland...
---
You too missed the Alpha AND Omega part. As well as the bigger issue.
---
Probably.
---
The 10/10 only escalates from hordes and patrols I believe. If it is from a squad, it’s a 5/10
---
How do I convince my friends to try this game for the first time?
---
There are both a 5/10 and 10/10 for rogue drones. They share the same name and a similar layout, but the loot is absolute shit for 5/10
---
maybe he didn't get the memo that neutral logis get concordokkened now and was expecting some fuckery
---
Pretty sure the replacement for DUST is dead. Now we need a replacement for the replacement.
---
I guess that's another hopeful way to look at it.
---
As long as you can prove it's yours (either by account subscription or email history etc.) then you don't have anything to worry about.
---
If proving conduit spawns 24/7 - take 2x 20mil caracals in a dead timezone, run cheapest t3 sites, enter proving ground with both, one caracal dies each time, the other gets t5 loot. Profit.
---
No krab gilas will enter it because they are krab gilas. 
---
Even now you don't have a reasonable chance of winning without 2b ship and 3b pod. If you want 1v1 pvp go spam duels on trade hub undock. 
---
Remove abyss pvp
---
I just came out of a 4 year break. What there doings a bug reason for me to re sub and get my buddy to join.
---
What would be the time and resource cost if you decided to build all of them?
---
Maybe after the imicus
---
I never had a problem with the fps in the beta. Then they decided they would up the graphics in preparation of the switch to PS4 and the fps and players dropped. And then it didn't release on PS4.
---
Just talk to the people who are in local with you. This isn't nullsec you know.  
---
(A fleet finder that actually helps you finding a fleet would be nice as well though)
---
Fuckin love your responses man. lol don't ever change
---
Meh, i dont know how to use drones anyway lol
---
That moment when you do all this and forget to turn on ship explosions.
---
Actually IRL I get so calm it's scary even to me. I'm mining in Null in a blingy 127B Rorq. Come out and play.
---
You got off easy. I can't say the same about my Widow.
---
What? You do realize fire is a natural part of the ecosystem and that fire suppression is one of the worst things for the health of a forest.
---
Nope.   But in my career I've worked with a lot of smart people, and some self-aggrandizing people.    In my experience these are non-overlapping sets.
---
Which isn't an issue I can give them whatever information they want. Old credit cards, ID, SSN whatever really. What Im not sure happens is if the person who hacked the account. Sold the character on the bazaar legitimately or something of the sort. I tried finding if they did in the forums but couldn't find anything because they archived the old forums but I can't do a search on them?  
---
In the event I prove it's my account (Which I most certainly will), my character. What happens if that character is somebody elses and they bought it rightfully. What sort of conclusion are we looking at, the character just gets returned to me? What about the other party are they shafted? Or because it was bought rightfully am I shafted?   
---
I just don't know their Policy on such an event/incident.
---
Love it. I can hear your voice when reading it.
---
That’s why you have something with you that can kill the rats, like a rorqual
---
Anything that requires CPU to operate in a POS is disabled when it goes into reinforcement - you also cannot fuel or anything. If you want to make the attackers lives hell you can take a cap stable scythe out, rep the shields by like 1% and refuel the stront bay. If they don't hit it and get it down past 25% shields IMMEDIATELY it will go into another reinforcement cycle.
---
But also this is why everyone hates POS.
---
prolly shoulda spent the time you spent writing this essay writing a support ticket to ccp ngl
---
Could someone please ELI5: reactions. How much work is involved and what kind of ISK can I expect from them?
---
&gt;This is my baby
---
If it was your baby, you wouldn't have neglected your relationship with it and let another raise it in your stead.  
---
Just sayinnnn
---
Lol I did this and asked in local if someone wants to zap me. One gent quickly obliged. Thank you sir.
---
This video is inaccurate the person asking for reps wasn't already a wreck when they asked.
---
Not for afk drone ratting though
---
Rorquals are immune to jams when in Indy core. Also barges can just be stored in a rorqual if it’s going to be attacked
---
Can anyone tell me what the old bonuses were?
---
It was actually a bad decision from the beginning to tap into console FPS, the market was already oversaturated and dominated by annual releases of new FPS franchise games.  Had they done it on PC it may have worked better, however, DUST was designed to fail from the moment they said "PS3".  From that second, it didn't matter how good the game was or how revolutionary the vision was, going PS3 was the worst possible decision CCP could have made with DUST.
---
fw
---
I did hence how I know the account is suspended. Just a situation like this I've read takes a long while so I understand I won't receive a definitive answer on whats going to happen until CCP does their investigation which could take weeks.
---
What’s the bandwidth difference?
---
Exploration sites.
---
Thanks, this is great stuff.  In terms of targets for 3 bombers, are we looking for mostly shit fit battleships or could we break the tank on a blingy  rattle or something?
---
There is no difference in +15 percent moon ore in high or null.
---
It's a gaming account, not an actual child. People stop playing their accounts all the time doesn't mean they don't value it any more.

It's almost like they said July 25th several weeks ago, and announced the changes themselves last month... huh, fancy that.
---
omfg 
---
it was a joke.........
---
IM LEGIT WORRIED
---
Or they're botting on it lol
---
Never underestimate someone's reluctance to lose a 60m isk ship.
---
I dont know what changed for you, be it something at work or home... but damn do I love your attitude lately.
---
Exactly, and I’m the one that gets called risk averse.

I actually toyed with a T1 Vexor on Sisi a few weeks ago and for at least the first level of fillamanets a 3 heavy drone Shield Vexor does decently. With the armor rep bonus and hybrid bonuses it looks even better.
---
I'm pretty sure they have to post notice to the bazaar to transfer a character. Go look and see if your toon has a transfer post.
---
Also, check to see if your email is still on the account. If it is, do a password reset and then log in to get real answers.
---
My high-grade asklepians would like to demonstrate otherwise. I can't wait.
---
Remember when they nerfed the Myrmidon? Back in 2007. I drank heavily after that.
---
The email isn't the same any more I checked.  
---
I tried to look for it on the Bazaar but the old forums are like only archived now. I can't figure out a way to perform a search on the old forums for the character.
---
If you are looking to keep this operation small, look for empty holes with poor PI. Last thing you want is a Corp wanting to move into your hole because your planets are pretty.
---
I already got enough anxiety D;
---
Oh no, whatever will I d-   
---
\*Laughs in Ishtar while warping to a Haven\*
---
Also have it tie into some kind of "PI efficiency index."
---
Successfully defend an outpost? The next few cycles are more efficient. Successfully attack one? It's less efficient.
---
Then tie it into Player Owned PI outposts, RTS players align themselves with corporations who then buff/debuff PI.
---
So, only 30 hours of mining to recoup. Cool.
---
And your experience is universal?
---
My recollection was not the 25th, but sometime in August.
---
Omg plz
---
Thanks! Sadly no tutorial, it's my first costume and I'm not confident enough in what I learned from making it that I'd make a tutorial on it.
---
If you're wondering, the mask, collar bit and chestplate are 3D printed and painted, while the coat is sown, with doodads glued and painted on.
---
Hey, if anyone wants to offload their now useless to bot VNIs... I will buy all of your hulls in Jita for 40m a piece no limit.
---
The automod bot is currently a little broken and not is not updating the OP to show the modified discord link.
---
The correct discord link is: https://discord.gg/tWeMAek or you can use the perma link: animeistrash.org/eve
---
You meant to say AFK ratting... at the start
---
no u
---
You wont believe me but... go to a safe spot, eject from ship... sit there for a few sec... reboard... and the rats seem to aggro less... I do it in my nyx all the time...
---
Uhh, okay?
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
It's almost like T3s and navy issues are completely different...
---
Yep huge difference.
---
That Sabre KM though...top notch.
---
*salivates in ninja salvaging*
---
This man knows CALSF
---
the ring thing is pretty old idea, its to create centrifugal force so you can walk around an stuff. 
---
(idk what its for in eve because we have fantasy ships here :D)
---
Have to be pretty shit at the game to drop a carrier on a VNI
---
That's a fair point- what sort of holes would constitute poor PI? Lack of plasma planets?
---
At least Evan undocks dude. When is the last time you gated your caps just looking for some fun? Dont talk shit about a dude who has bigger balls than you.
---
They're kinda potato quality because it's an advertisement for the Frigates of EVE book of cross sections (which is fantastic, by the way) but some of the frigates are shown here: https://www.eveonline.com/article/frigates-of-eve-online-the-cross-sections-now-available
---
anxiety is simply living in the future, unable to come back on command.  
---
you need to realize its out of your hands, and that worry is poor use of imagination.
---
Playing since 2007 and don't have a titan yet? Big yikes
---
Initially I was hoping to turn the bug into a feature here and keep combat/relic sites as bait for daytrippers. That said, I think low sec is probably wiser for keeping a low profile. Cloaky transports mean it won't be too bad for logistics.
---
The primary source for datacores is Faction Warfare. The LP store there, to be exact. Each of the factions gets different ones. 
---
The isk/lp ratio isn't great, but it's pretty consistent. How are your skills? Better science skills = better chance of success = fewer datacores wasted.
---
Are we all really just trying to fly as fast as we can through life, hoping that the self destruct timer never catches up to us?
---
Something something Provi doesnt have caps ...
---
I'll try my best it just isn't easy. Thank you for the wise words.
---
Generally if the system only has a few planets, or cannot make anything past p2 (or a few p3) it will not be on the menu for a Corp looking to do PI. If you can find a system without plasma or lava planets it will go a long way towards keeping PI people disinterested.
---
Include ISK, people will follow money.
---
It seems to me that in a game with so many sticks, we need carrots for other playstyles, so are you suggesting supporting the solo playstyle through some mechanic?  If so, what would that be?
---
Isn’t that exactly what your OP is though?
---
Good to know!
---
:=)
---
Is it any good? ... Planning to try it tonight.
---
7min of muninn pov, I think i'm gonna throw up
---
New mining fleet Meta is Avatars. Can fit 6 miner II's on those bad bois.
---
Could've taken a better image..
---
I've always been partial to the original version. The 2nd and 3rd are just too busy to really get that grinding march feeling
---
https://youtu.be/-b5X69vREAg
---
That would be great, they need a role but that role shouldn't be 'everything subcaps do but better'.
---
Got a long way to go lol
---
I used to do havens in a pair of domis. Warp in at range, drop sentries and fire rails. Target small shit first so they don't get inder the sentries. I was thinking the new VNI might be able to do something similar for hubs.
---
Yet here we are, safe under the umbrella.
---
VNI is now a fantastic ship, maybe even OP (look at its bonuses compared to what other navy cruiser get - poor Caracal NI at the back of the line). And yeah you can't 100MN heavy drone AFK rat any more which is also great.
---
love how you're getting downvoted haha
---
Well Katee Sackhof is in it. It can be some B movie and I'd still watch it
---
Domis have always been great. Two of them doing RR can handle a haven and finish it pretty handily.
---
The problem with caps and subcaps being built from the same resource pool is that they will always be in direct competition for the same stuff, which intrinsically links them and makes it more difficult to tweak one without changing the other significantly. Suppose CCP increased the build material of capitals, because caps are still powerful, people will still build them, which means there will be increased demand for minerals, which drives up the price of minerals. This also increases the price to build subcaps, and the "nerf" in capital cost ends up being not very effective because it also nerfed sub costs indirectly.
---
Capitals have unique capabilities compared to subs, and the price of all the other "unique capability" ships are split between minerals and other costs. T2 ships have moongoo, T3 have sleeper salvage, Faction ships have LP. That split cost allows another knob to tweak to balance those ships without touching the cost of base T1 subs, and with how bad CCP at predicting implications of balance changes, the cost of caps has to be spun off from the cost of subs so they can't fuck up as much.
---
Without a single clue of how to fight a solo cruiser if the system's cyno jammed :)
---
T3C's are like extremely versatile mini battleships with cruiser speed. Why on Earth you would think to compare a t3c to a VNI is beyond me.
---
A rattle would be possible depending on the fit. If he is good he’ll immediately drop light drones, and start MJD, so you either get close and die trying to land scram or pull range and let him escape. 
---
A bad rattle pilot with a shit fit will try to use heavies against you and won’t have MJD fitted, and you’ll kill it easily.
---
Oh I apologize for not getting out of my recliner. Picking up the DSLR and taking proper shots of the fucking TV.
---
Go munch on an asteroid or something...
---
Yes but perfectly safe in this hardcore PVP game!
---
Lol, I guess you haven't been to delve ever.
---
I'm doing the same thing right now. Can confirm it works. I'm in Ammamake running the badass anoms btw.
---
I second Sibire, I wanna hear these details!
---
It's interesting to notice CCP choices, VNI was the first choice for pve newbies for good reasons, now CCP prefer to sacrifice newbies because they are unable (or they don't want) do whatever it takes to ban bots.
---
Dear CCP, with a management like this it will be a miracle if Eve will survive another year...
---
Myrmidon is better and can fit MJD
---
Are wormhole systems persistent? By wormhole spaces I mean the systems with names that start with the letter J (jxxxxx). I hear and read about people and corps living in w-space and saw a Corp structure in w-space myself. So I supose the system itself is persistent even though the wormholes that lead in and out of those systems expire and re-open in different places of the w-space system? And if so are they persistent like forever? You can virtually (or relatively?) move around the galaxy by just staying in a w-space system with a k-space static wormhole?
---
In a wormhole you should be fine if you keep it fuelled and don't go out of your way to piss people off. Can't really comment on lowsec.
---
I have, and they're mostly braindead krabs who'd be absolutely helpless if they ever grew the balls to leave umbrella range.
---
Yeah, but when they are in umbrella range those braindead krabs will happily drop a lot more than a mere carrier on your VNI.
---
Never underestimate the douche of goons.
---
Each a 6 pack of beer
---
You know you can get your own supers too?
---
I think everyone who’s undocked or docked in Jita with something expensive has learnt this the hard way
---
Is this seriously already on Tranquility?
---
(Looks like VNI will be all sorts of useful in other stuff, like Abyssals and *gasp* PVP)
---
Only took you how long? 2 months? At this rate you'll control all of Detorid before 2028! Good fuckin' job boys!
---
All I’ve done is mine in this game. Looking to branch out and try ratting/salvaging. 
---
What are some good ships/fits to try
---
Just piggy-backing here: training the "Fast Talk" skill should increase gains in security status, such as from Ratting.
---
The fastest way is to go to a Concord station where you can buy specific clone tags and turn them in for sec status.
---
The longer way is to hunt these rats in low sec systems (.01) and only kill the clone rats, pick up tag &amp; run away till the next one. You can usually find them in belts etc
---
And this is why the game is stale as fuck. Everybody wants capitals to be a giant “I WIN” button.
---
This has got to be one of the most inconsequential major wars right?
---
does anybody care about this sov anymore?
---
Better than the town called Claymore. That place is just a graveyard.
---
would you mind sharing the files for the 3D prints?
---
The VNI is dead, long live the VNI
---
Sure. It does need a little more skilling though.
---
I loooove the Gallente's hockey fight blaster pvp style (I'm gonna grab this guy by the shirt and we're gonna punch each other till someone falls down), but good lord they have some ugly ships.
---
and then was [eaten by crabs](https://www.newsweek.com/amelia-earhart-mystery-was-lost-pilot-eaten-giant-coconut-crabs-709635)
---
Everything you said is correct. There are a few thousand wormhole systems, always the same, they don’t change class, static or expire. I actually live in a wormhole system at the moment, and my Corp has had the same hole for over a year now. 
---
Wormholes themselves, are like stargates, but are signatures that need to be scanned down. They do expire, either when they get too old, or when too much mass goes through it.
---
This can be a little confusing, because if someone says “I live in a wormhole” they live in a wormhole *system*, as opposed to when someone says “the wormhole collapsed” which refers to the gateway.
---
Proof that I didn't get rid of bad rolls by ditching d&amp;d \**sigh\**
---
nice AAS ! the excitement and euphoria are palpable in the way you tell your story! Nice work, guys!
---
you can win with 500 M orthrus, this had been proved many time, if you don't like abyssal pvp don't do it but let people who want fair 1v1 do It.
---
If conduit spawned all the time more people would be willing to give a try.
---
and If you wanted to do 2 caracal you need to know that most of the time the special cache is filled with 10M of loot at best.

I have a scanner alt sitting in a C1 wolf rayet with LS static, no cits, no towers, only pocos, very tight system with every planet on dscan. When I entered the system had like 40 anoms so I'm pretty sure it's uninhabited. Ran some of the sites but the isk/h just isn't worth my time. You can have it free of charge if you want, just send me a pm with your ig name.
---
less people are running abyss since the release. and gate permanently open would lead to fight opportunity as people would try to sneak In for the cache.
---
Yes the systems are permanent, just the connections change. Yes, with any luck you can move all across the galaxy via wormholes. With my luck though, usually the holes I find lead to exactly the opposite side of the map.

Why should they leave Umbrella range if they are safe within the range. Makes no sense.

It's almost like there's more to this game than spending all day krabbing safely...

I imagine if we ever develop the tech for FTL alcubierre drives, we'll need that sort of structure to generate the bubble it requires.

Give those sites more drop will only reduce value of the loot further

And this is why I switched ratting ships months ago.

If they make it open, they should require you sit and wait until someone else comes in, then you get 20 minutes.
---
That's a very bad fit. You fitted no tank on a ship that's heavily bonused to tanking.  What little tank you DID fit was the wrong type, shield on an armour tanking ship.

Its also the idea for the warp drive, basicly a warp ring if i remember  right.

&gt; The problem with caps and subcaps being built from the same resource pool is that they will always be in direct competition for the same stuff, which intrinsically links them and makes it more difficult to tweak one without changing the other significantly.  
---
I dont agree that this is a problem and would argue that that is a good thing to promote resource scarcity and complexity in the system.
---
&gt; Suppose CCP increased the build material of capitals, because caps are still powerful, people will still build them, which means there will be increased demand for minerals, which drives up the price of minerals. This also increases the price to build subcaps, and the "nerf" in capital cost ends up being not very effective because it also nerfed sub costs indirectly. 
---
Increased mineral prices is a good thing, we operated on them before and they were lovely for money making.  The other aspect of why I dont think this would be such a significant problem is that there are some soft restrictions to capital construction in skills needed, system security status, and sovereignty (as well as structure costs).  So its not a 1 to 1 ratio of cost increase across the board.  I do not believe the subcap cost increase would be that much.
---
&gt; Capitals have unique capabilities compared to subs, and the price of all the other "unique capability" ships are split between minerals and other costs. T2 ships have moongoo, T3 have sleeper salvage, Faction ships have LP. That split cost allows another knob to tweak to balance those ships without touching the cost of base T1 subs, and with how bad CCP at predicting implications of balance changes, the cost of caps has to be spun off from the cost of subs so they can't fuck up as much. 
---
That is specifically done to allow people without immediate access to these special resources to be able to build capitals and compete without being removed from the rare resource needed to build them.  Mind you the current supercap balance basically makes this a mute point until rectified with regards to sovereignty but with regards to my other points I do not think that it is impossible to tweak costs of capitals and very adversely affects subcapitals.  But I also don't thin k that the cost is the problem ( or the best way to balance capitals just with how human players work and operate.).  I think that regular caps are in a good or decent spot right now and that it is solely supers that need nerfing or the intro of some tool to allow people to punch up and destroy supers ( which in turn would help the economy with desperately needed destruction of supers and their safe zones.)
---
All right cool thanks. Just a side question, when you say live in wormhole space. You mean literally stay there most of the time and be inside of it when the wormhole collapses? Or does it mean visit it regularly for all you pve and or pvp activities.
---
Thank you, I was debating that or asking how you play videogames if your parents don't have a basement.
---
Yeah but 90% of the Eve players on here are suspicious and untrusting enough to think you're bullshitting them. It's a feature, not a bug, of the game.
---
After the launcher tries to start, it does leave some process running in the background. I've killed them but the launcher still won't start. It doesn't start after a reboot either. Appreciate the response though.
---
The game has so many problems at this point that there is no single thing that will fix it.
---
Solo might be more of an indirect result than a goal. One major issue seems to be that null is so profitable that players have no reason to be anywhere else. So they join a blob and go there to farm/bot.
---
The older iterations (a la *2001: A space odyssey*) are based on the concept of artificial sudo-gravity generation, more modern iterations (*Star Trek: Enterprise*'s Vulcan ships/*Eve online*'s Astero) are most likely based on the Alcubierre drive.
---
I'm not on a Mac.
---
And what would you consider more lucky then? Thanks for the link.
---
Anyone have any suggestions for an active ratting fit with these now?
---
I am terrible with making fittings but this could be a nice change.
---
Yep.  One of a few social skills to train to 4.
---
morale drops fater than Ihubs
---
There's action there right now if you hurry!!!
---
I agree
---
You are new to this, aren't you?
---
Is the NPC invasion thing still happening?
---
Been out of game for a while, read about it. Curious how it panned out.
---
Both of those statements can be applied to almost any cruiser in the game, which makes them pretty meaningless.
---
Well yeah, the same can be said for any brawly fit.
---
If your friends have scrimmed/played poker etc... explain that pvp in eve gives the same shakes.
---
Then maybe show them a good trailer like so...
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLbAWQifWv8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLbAWQifWv8) 
---
And finally teach them manual piloting asap, very often new players are put off by the lack of control they experience in flying.
---
lmao fuck man
---
absolutely, the "wooom" followed by bleeps and bloops aged like a fine wine
---
The question is why did it take so much time to remove local and change VNI?
---
You're a piece of shit
---
I wish PI had conflict in it's gameplay. Then I might actually be arsed to do it
---
If its Gallente ambitions....why does it have a drifter corpse being picked up?
---
I used to do that because all you need is a session change but the with the domi they just go back to drones. Like the vni didn't have this problem and with the vni i used to eject in the site not even a safe lol.
---
Better, yes, but risk = reward.
---
Well, I agree, and most things that live long enough develop problems, but what do you propose to do about it?  It can be more than one thing.  Saying there *are* problems is easy; helping resolve them is difficult but necessary.  Otherwise all we end up doing in conversation is complaining.
---
I'd suggest low sec static C1 or C2 for concealment and as long as you know what you're doing there is little to no risk being bashed by random people. Keep it fueled and flying a DST should be enough to start with.
---
i like Deserts, but its a bit unfair and plays not much like a homworld game (a cornered enemy carrier w/o any access to resurces will just suddenly shit out 12 cruisers and 50 armored vehicles), there is not much strategy besides ZERG RUSH in that game (unlike the OG homeworld and its later expansions)
---
Probably because of the ewar which takes a mid slot. But who still afk rat after blackout anyways?
---
\&gt; "You know what, fuck everything, just give me a fucking Orca".  
---
god damn lol
---
It must've been done on porpoise
---
I'm not sorry.
---
I say leave PI alone.  I don't understand why everything in the game needs to be this super interactive fighting thing for everyone.  An Industrialist can make as much or as little as they want and high level industrialists are already doing a lot of stuff every time they log in.
---
It goes like this.
---
Log in.  Get PI running. Log into PI alts.  Reset PI.  Pick up PI.  Contract PI to main. Pick up PI.  Drop PI into production planet.  Move ore to reprocessing.  Open Inustry tab.  Deliver BPs.  Reprocess ore.  Start runs and copies.  Park ship.  Move product to market.  Fight people on market for price.  Go back home.  Mine for hours.
---
This is hours and hours of stuff to do every day.  And do we really want the price of everything to go up because it's even more difficult to get PI?  It's just more stuff for large alliances to own.  That'll leave nothing but mining to the little guys.  Leave it be.
---
You misspelled “smaller”, or maybe “skillful”.
---
weewooweewoo
---
shit y'all, space police are coming
---
zzzzzz
---
If you look at all of yours costs, and break it out, per item created, its not a large % of cost.  
---
Example : According to my internal numbers, for myself, creating parts locally (yes, in null), a DCUII will costs 341,000 in parts and building sub parts, 5000 isk to put on an assembly line, and 52,146 ISK to research.  
---
What do I mean by research?  I do NOT consider sunk costs of BPO's, or any copying costs.  That is the average it takes to invent 1 run, based on the odds associated with my current skills.  They are mostly 4's across the board, not super optimized.  If you have a 43% chance to make one 10 run BPC, you can calculate, \*on average\*, the cost to research one item.  I won't bore you with the math.
---
This means 13% of the costs associated with building this item is tied up in research, 52,146 / 398,988.  Lets suppose you grind away all of this.  In order to explore, or FW to get the datacores to do this research, that takes you, suppose, 5 minutes on average.  Per hour, if this cost were reduced to 'zero' because you did the work yourself, you make 52,146 \* 12, so 500,000 isk.  (obviously, you get LP, other stuff, etc.  This is just accounting for what you obtain for the purposes of your invention).
---
However, just training your science skills better, you can bring that 13% down to 10%, for 10 days of training.  
---
Once you go bulk into T2 production, just buy the cores.  Farming all the ones you need, it's probably not worth the effort, as compared to all the other places in the production line you can improve costs.  (Good old Pareto Rule here).
---
Counter Example : Medium Hybrid Burst Aeroator II.  T2 rigs might have a completely different cost profile, depending on \*decryptors\* employed.  But again, how much exploration do you want to do for the T2 salvage loot needs to be considered.
---
"Oh, but thats T2 items, what about the hulls!"
---
By my math, an Ares is 3% costs associated with invention.  That's a rounding error, and can be made up with market manipulation.  
---
Now, I do \*augment\* my datacores through exploration.  No one ever seems to want to do data sites.  But its just a side hustle because I can use them all.  I don't hunt them down because its my primary source of datacores.
---
This is a funny post. 
---
There are not many corporations in this game that are sucky enough to get effectively camped by Wingspan. There are even less that will run from a Wingspan camp. It's quite well-known that Wingspan is full of noobs and/or low-skill PvPers flying 2-4 billion ISK T3 cruisers to hunt exclusively for unarmed T1 exploration frigates. Trust me; I used to be in Wingspan.
---
There are some good pilots in the corp, but they are very few and far between. Their "FCs" are a complete joke, allowing for all sorts of embarrassing disorganization and some of the worst comms discipline I've ever seen (who's that Luigi prick that loves to hear himself talk). 
---
The only thing Wingspan's got going for it is a charismatic CEO with a popular YouTube channel. But Chance probably averages an hour of playtime per month, so that boon is kinda moot as well.
---
&gt; you can win with 500 M orthrus
---
This is where the problem is. In this case each time a pvp happens it incurs a 500M loss no matter what. How long do you think people are gonna keep throwing 500M away for pvp? That's $5 or 10 hours of afk ratting. Do the math.
---
&gt; Which is fine by me afk ratting as a concept for playing a game is retarded
---
PvE in this game is retarded, doesn't matter if it's AFK or not. AFK ratting made it somewhat bearable.
---
What guide would you reccomend for manual piloting?
---
ya you guys really 'made history' last night lmfao

Helois/Imicus is being redesigned.
---
I was there.
---
Hi, thanks for the kind offer! Sounds like an ideal system. Are there any pros/cons to a wolf rayet hole in terms of gas harvesting, industry, etc?
---
You could alternatively scale some form of lock range or scan res penalty for x duration alongside the alignment penalty on cloak. Both would have to be pretty drastic though.
---
Overall this actually sounds neat to me. I could see ten supers undocking and having to align past a structure as a positive change, increasing the time to cyno effectively. 
---
They should probably still land on the same grid, but have the destination penalty range quickly scale out to 100+km. Warp and cloak penalty would probably need to be around 30-60s.
---
Leant a friend my main right before extractors became a thing while I took a break to get back on my feet IRL. Go to message buddy on fb a few weeks later and he has me blocked. Weird. 
---
Log into my main a few weeks later to start playing again and he went from 150 mil sp to 8mil sp. 
---
I put in a ticket and they contacted him he told them my real name and that it was given to him and there was fictional money transferred and ccp basically said “not dealing with it “ 
---
Awesome.
---
Anyone found the killmail on this?  I would love to see the shitty fit on that proteus.
---
But the old VNI was ok because it used drones. You could fit nav computers and project good dps even against kitey cruisers.

This one loses to pretty much any faction cruiser besides the SFI (which also could use a buff)

Luckily the character is still on zkillboard and flying things that only a character with a lot of skill points would typically fly. So the SP is there, however I dont see whats stopping anyone that ever hacks anyone from just saying that to get CCP off their backs.

You're welcome.
---
I think its the bubble thing, the rings don't spin on this one.

Thanks for that wonderfully insightful post my man.

Will CCP ever delete characters/free up names of banned accounts? The game has been out so long that a lot of cool names are already taken but so little are active
---
WH corps live and operate out of a WH system. A WH system will always have at least one or two consistent WH out, leading to the same type of space (Null, HS, another class of WH system, etc). This is called the static. 
---
You'll also often get additional WH that randomly appear, which could lead anywhere.
---
won 1 of 6-7 iHubs... you are elit!

Look, you got to go balls out with your shit. Go low sec and just put it all on the line. Take your best ships and use them. Go after everything that moves. If you don't go out and hunt, you'll just be sad and alone. The game is boring if you hide out all the time. Get you that good pussy.

 When you sign in via SSO you are bounced back to the /manage page. So only the owner can check those boxes. Once that box is checked and you click Create again, it will enable it. 
---
If you are the owner of the character, then you can just auth via ESI directly with Pyfa/Evemon. This feature is mostly useful for helping others, or with a character your are looking to buy on the bazaar
---
Let's test it then, pick either SiSi or Jita, bring 'any cruiser', I'll bring a T2-fit VNI and we'll see what wins
---
Jesus Christ, you must feel really good about yourself. You want a sticker? A little token for your good deed for the day?
---
You do realize that combat sites in wormholes are visible to everyone without scanning right? Unless people are farming the relic / data sites then you'll have a direct warp in to them just like you would in null sec. Plus its totally not like people are constantly rolling C5's looking for people ratting or anything. You definitely don't need to watch your back for new sigs popping up from god knows where with people wanting to kill you. That never happens. WH Space is krab central.
---
Why would you use a VNI when you can use a Vexor like that?
---
Theres a great series of books "the castle federation" whose ships use this concept with great translation to a layman level
---
See that 50% railgun tracking bonus? Medium rails are quite formidable. Use guns for longer range and drones for brawl.
---
Now that its live I've tested it fully.  A dual rep fit simply will not work.  You will be capped out before your ancil runs out of paste.
---
one of the first players to report his corpse being scooped spotted by his corp-mate was a Gallente pilot :)
---
I'v not checked if it can or not.. didnt even think of looking at the base line vexor.
---
All the bots are crying while pvpers celebrate. What a time to be alive!
---
Cant play afk? Reduce your afk ship speed by half if you are using heavies.

I will stream tomorrow Friday 6pm EVE time to check the dual rep. Only VNI’s stream :) I couldn’t believe how good was with a single ancil repper.

---
Admittedly I'm a lousy hunter! My dexterity sucks so the only time I'm useful in pvp is larger fleets or cloaky ambush ganking. Though I understand what you mean- playing in a group is more enjoyable, and ultimately EVE is a PVP game (though counterpoint is that even playing the markets is a form of PVP). If I ever get the nerve to nuke my main's faction/security standings I may try out FW in low sec lol
---
There is certainly a difference in the number of those moons in highsec and lowsec though.

If you don't broadcast, and you're not on watch list or fc.... You're not getting reped. Even if you ask.

Good man/woman! You'll get better with practice! Get you that figurative pussy/cock!!
---
I have tested it, 45s with your prop off.  Heating your single nos and cap booster.  If your reps and guns are heated, and they should be, you have 45 seconds.   6 cycles of the ancil.  You need to run your prop?  Good luck.
---
which brings us back to people not getting to hunt exhumers and barges because PANIC, sure the rats may get a few kills but pvpers/hunters lose more targets.

---
Drones don't count as \*Small Weapons\* so cloaky asteros and stratios won't get any dps benefit.
---
oh okay lol
---
well i disagree somewhat with you, but we are very fragmented in i suppose the nature that is providence in how its run.
---
never told anyone not to use any tool, just can't help it people who get bigger tools move to bluerer doughnuts at points where we near critcal amounts.
---
but does depend upon activity levels, and as well, ccp seem intent upon making nrds impossible to run its only a matter of time that everyone half of eve is  blue and we can use our big toys just like everyone else, when we have a superior advantage and can drop on people.
---
but yes, not sure what dropping any one or 2 super that we had at current would of made a difference when we only got what we got in terms of fleet numbers (and faxes).
---
You are going to have a hard time making a profit after setting up a refinery, and onlining the gas reactor, the fuel costs are ongoing, and you will be hard pressed (probably imposibly) to keep up.
---
I am the only one who travels the chain huffing, I stockpiled 1.5B of gas thinking I could react it, ended up having to dump it in Jita.
---
Sure, sounds fun, and I need to practice kiting in cruisers anyway. Will you be on later tonight?
---
Fair enough. Too bad about the drones- don't suppose you know if RLMLs count as small weapons here? (Small missiles but medium platform)
---
Im re-running the api for the entire region at this moment, it should be avalible soon. Will edit this post when I see it in the database.
---
Giving them a good fight was not the issue. The issue was that their spy in our corp could see everything we where doing and what our fleet comp was. So no matter what we did they would have a strategic advantage.
---
Granted we could have probably done better. We where still in the process of looking at corp wh doctrines and this is where i as a CEO failed to have this in place before we moved in.
---
Who knows right. We might give it another go or maybe not. Always a option on the table.
---
Trying to balance teleportation mechanics is such a clusterfuck in every game. Specially now that all the  scrub feels entitled to ratting in a nyx.
---
What if they had a apm mini game where if you were really player skilled you could mine more than if you were just afk mining.
---
Example, randomly your systems will find a core/pocket in the astroid and the system will need to be manually used for better results on x cycles where if you are afk and those things are missed you get worse cycles for x cycles
---
Hit up The Spire
---
Tempted to get it just for the firetail
---
It only has 3 turret slots base.  so 4.5 effective turrets of damage with max skills  Compare that to a vexor's 4\*1.25=5. I guess the tracking is nice.
---
IDK, anyway you look at it this seems like just a straight nerf to me.
---
[It's not a town, but a county.](https://goo.gl/maps/nBX1sa1rzARwhdzR9)

WW and Minnies were not together in this fight. It's just old good lowsec tradition to welcome newcomers with fire.
---
Yeah, dump everything and start over.
---
Try. Harder.
---
&gt; And the Domi is like the old VNI but you know.. Battleship, not every corp or alliance has a super umbrella to drop on ratting domi's 
---
Did you know a ratting domi with 3 hyperspatial rigs + 3 inertial stabs/4 dda's + shield tank costs less to lose than a vni (after insurance), warps slightly faster than a vni and only has a slightly worse align time?
---
I would like combination of Simcity Buildit, Tribal Wars, and Clash of Clans.
---
You build up your colony(s).  Build you'll have that smash up of simcity,tribal wars, and clash of clans.  Send Corvettes and Frigs to raid ,patrol space lanes, or ship things via industrial to stations planets.  See them in EVE.  Protect or raid them.    CCP has micro transactions for convenience things.
---
No, it doesn't lie. You just have a bug.
---
well that is being disingenuous. have been a few times that you've called in nc or horde (and i wouldn't complain) i mean we haven't called in goons for every fight either, just happens at sometimes. i'd as always perfer to fight our own battles, but in the era of everything tz tanked it often hard for most of us to do us/auz ops alone (well i guess that we don't get enough pilots to compete at similar numbers with you, and generally you don't have enough to compete in eu at times. 
---
don't think that is the be all end of all things, but people just seem to want to talk shit and or stir the pots
---
eve with the vni price drop ?

Hey man stop that voice of reason shit, the dramaqueens are trying to proclaim the end of this ship altogether

---
I ran fullerite reactions for years out of lowsec, never had a POS reinforced (I only put them on shitty moons), had an athanor reinforced once that was on a half decent moon but TZ tanking works wonders.
---
Not long after athanors came out the bottom fell out of the market as people realised it was far less of a PITA than it used to be so I got out.
---
Logistics was a hassle. I wasn't harvesting anything myself, just buying from Jita. I was on average importing at least a JF load of volume a day to my infrastructure (the output is comparatively tiny and high value so I was taking that to Jita in a BR). 
---
My main considerations if starting up again would be proximity to trade hubs, off the beaten path, and not anchored at a moon that someone might want.

Here's an idea... just rat in the any ole damn ship you want. The blackout will do more to your decision than whatever VNI changes did.
---
thanks for the warm welcome :)

did you take this picture with a sandal
---
Oh wow that's just depressing
---
Says every idiot who thinks bots can only be combated by labotomizing the game.
---
Ticks are just lower, but yes you can still rat with a vni/vexor. I would prefer you use the vni, killing a ratting vexor is not worth the Intel I give doing so.
---
Oh yeah I remember that, that was ages ago though wasn't it? I'm tempted to try to make it in space engineers but I don't know how well it will translate

I carrier rat, my son rat's in a vni tho so iv been looking at stats and shit to try help him out
---
Birkies if you really needed to know...
---
Myrmidon doesn't die to Havens.
---
And you even have enough fitting space left to fit MJD,Neuts and a cyno  if you are worried about being caught.
---
I got to hand it to you, that was a good one.
---
This is some gay ass shit lmao
---
Yeah, I should be
---
probably, but the tracking will help dealing with small shit in FW

Bachelors+1 graduate degree about 67% done with second graduate degree...99th percentile in educational level too.

Hey Reed! This was my adventure. Basically I camped hit their mining fleet, they decided to move out. I caught their move with their pants down and convinced them to sell me their structure.
---
+1
---
Fuck off. VNI botting has been fucking RAMPANT for the past few years. This is a change that is much needed, along with the culling of drone skills for alphas.
---
There are just too many issues to list, and CCP has a long history of not caring. Some problems that are easy to fix would be balance, free intel, cynos, and to some extent botting.
---
&gt;Otherwise all we end up doing in conversation is complaining.
---
I have seen a fuckton of suggestions that meet all levels of "constructive" over the years. I would say they have been mostly ignored. It might have taken a decade or more for CCP to touch ECM, and it is still broken/overpowered.
---
You you want to gather gas, say from a C1 for reactions, you would be better off getting a C2/C1/K-Whatever.   
---
Learn to roll and your gas supply is unlimited.    
---
If you wanna go REALLY crazy with reactions.  A C4/C4/C5 is the way to go.  There's you're unlimited supply of all reaction mats.
---
They transferred it to me so it never made the list as I owned it for awhile while it unanchored. Scooped a lot of loot
---
Completing a hub will make the vexor profitable. T2 or faction medium drones. It slow but cheap.
---
I was excited at the thought of bombing some random Dust players (in my Drake). Then I learned it was only on PS3 =(
---
I’ve had the thought that when CCP changes a ship they should only change the blueprints. That way if the remaining old hulls are deemed superior their killmail value goes up and up as their numbers dwindle...
---
Are there any guides out there on how best to fit and fly dreadnoughts?
---
Check pms
---
Fuck your afk vni you wont be missed.
---
Explain the Nestor then.
---
Almost as depressing as the 0 subcap ratters I found to gank today. I had to settle for lucksaccing some x-type hardeners in a random wreck and 1v1ing an interceptor who went for me despite having no backup and no guns.
---
Yeah apparently he started it in June 2016.  Oh well.
---
Translating into Space Engineers can be tricky but doable.  MSPaint is your friend, as well as a calculator.
---
I still to this day don't understand why they went with the PS3. ( almost less than a year before the PS4 was set to release.) I knew it was doomed from the start when they announced it.
---
Thanks for the insight- when it comes to choosing the crappiest moons (I have 0 interest in moon mining) what should I be aiming for? Lol weird question I know
---
Too bad planetside 2 isn't owned by Pearl Abyss :(
---
Best fuck up in years.
---
I'm not sure you even need to do anything with your ewar. Just having it on your ship is enough for rats to switch.
---
I need a couple tips for mining. Because I suck and keep getting owned lol. I’ve been trying to build up a fund to invest in a larger mining ship, but my venture, plus miner II drill and upgrade cost me around 3mil and I usually end up getting killed before I can at least break even. Any tips on what ore i should be going for? Or sector I should be in? Should I be going into sectors and clearing them of NPC’s with another ship (opposer to just running away and looking for an empty sector) before hand? Should I just be looking for a mining Corp to mine with people? I keep venturing into low sec to find some higher value ore since my cargo hold can’t hold more then 5000m3 but I’ve been somewhat successful and un-successful in these attempts. am I doing this all wrong? Lol 
---
Thanks!
---
Agreed, may it never end.

eh from my testing just keeping a point on the first rat through the fhub kept aggro on my dominix.
---
So much for logging into Eve this afternoon.

Where are you roaming?
---
Commenting for results
---
As I recall Sony threw money at them.

If you have 0 interest at all, then don't anchor it at any moon.

The truth will set you free

Good to see you are still doing Zam things bro !

His next post is gonna be about having powerful allies in nullsec.

hey joe wanna boil some krabs?
---
Yes! Praise Bob!
---
Hm I must be confusing it with the old POS system, thought Athanor had to be placed at those moon mining beacons. Learn something new every day!
---
It's not a bug.  It's a feature.
---
Yea me too. Been on Reddit more than in game due to irl.   Mostly just messing with markets
---
waaaaiiiitt...i've  been out of the loop for awhile now, i won eve, but.. what did they do to the vni?
---
That thought is old as eve..
---
Coreli Corporation runs Delve, they just let goons live there to provide content
---
That draws attention in Zkill. Best to run them and leave the rest. Do your baiting in neighboring holes.
---
I really, really hope CCP implement some sort of RTS style thing for planets. Let us hire mercenaries, attack eachother's planets, and actually use our ships to shoot shit on the ground again like the mechanics that are already in place.
---
This would be really, really fun.
---
Its not true, unless your scope of pve is ratting and mining.
---
Sounds like you're trying to go at it alone.   
---
I don't recommend daytripping in something like a rattle. Either find a corp with an established upwell in J Space, or settle for something less... ambitious.. if you're a newbro.
---
Can someone explain to me why this won't be usable to AFK rat anymore? From what I understand the DPS bonus of the drones is lowered, but you can still AFK rat, can't you?
---
There's three things you can do to help yourself.
---
One, go to your starter system or near it, open your fleet finder, and look for public mining fleets. They'll have orcas and hordes of drones to protect you.
---
Two, join a wormhole Corp. WHs have fancy sites in them and can be extremely quiet a couple jumps deep in C2 or c3s depending on the statics. 
---
Three, get some hobgoblins and only mine in highsec. The venture should have enough dronespace to launch 2 I think, which will keep you safe.
---
Also, dont forget to tank! A medium shield extender and/or core defense extensor rigs will help out.
---
Just fit a railgun and shoot a rat... Gain aggro and then drop drones.
---
imagine by confusion when I - not reading news alpha noob - logged in to fly my favourite ship. 
---
No more heavy x5 :c
---
Yay.....boo-YAY
---
That would be what I would think, or have a very large penalty placed when repairing sub capitals.  
---
If you want to repair small things, bring small small ships.  Want to repair capital ships, bring FAXs.
---
Honestly I haven't seen a good one.
---
I wrote a small mini-tutorial here but it assumes basic intelligence.
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bdxbjv/pvp\_training/el1y9mn/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bdxbjv/pvp_training/el1y9mn/) 
---
The alternative is to maintain isometric view (alt-1 camera mode) of your ship and hold down the approach key (I think default is Q), and click once for XY axis and once for Z, meaning a quick double click while holding Q will make your ship go where you double clicked on the same Z plane (however once you reach the point, your ship will stop aka absolute coordinate, wheares normal double click will make you align to double click infinitely). This isometric control in alt-1 gives you better understanding what's on the grid and how it relates positionally.
---
The important thing is new player understands it's completely possible to fully control your ship and that they realize double clicking in space will make them move there (don't remember if it's even taught in the in game tutorials). It's good to practise manual orbiting around a jettisoned can in space, followed by flying manual against rats, followed by flying manual in pvp.
---
Auto target works though... Never had aggro issues in my VNI ever
---
[https://updates.eveonline.com/](https://updates.eveonline.com/)
---
Website of updates and patch notes. Major things I think include Command Destroyers, VNI/Carrier/Rorqual changes, and Triglavian ships.
---
Haha get rekt bot.
---
you're right it was more like 5-1 I was being nice
---
Are you viewing it in an Omega or Alpha clone?
---
Neither did I, and I never used any ewar. It's a signature radius issue not an ewar one. Auto-targeter doesn't aggro, plain and simple. Using a warp disruptor is a surefire and tested method of guaranteeing aggro for moving to a new ratting ship such as the Domi where the drones are significantly more likely to be targeted than a VNI.
---
Thank you  that's great
---
Thank you much appreciated
---
I'll be the Judge of that
---
"also cloaky stuff"
---
So you are back for easy kills. Those are drying up, so your going to quit again like the other 75ish returning vets or you will join the nerf cyno brigade.....
---
Enjoy your stay in empty space and Reddit.
---
Not sure what you're looking at, but as an AFK ratting ship it is no longer an optimal choice.
---
Ticks are going to be much lower. It's significantly outclassed in applied drone DPS by the Myrm and Domi, and including more expensive ships, by the Gila, Ishtar, and Rattlesnake. It also performs no significantly better than the T1 Vexor.
---
Making less free isk per hour, whether AFK or bot, is kind of the point. It's no longer the optimal ship, and instead is a strong brawler that adds more flavor to the PvP landscape. Before, there was simply no superior option cheaper than the Rattlesnake.
---
when will netflix make a eve series with keanu for me?
---
I have found the resist bonus to be almost as good as the rep bonus if active tanking them. The resist bonus also translates better with a passive tank so the current rep bonus is a bit weak... If they changed the rep bonus to, say, 7.5% rep amount AND 7.5% reduced cap use per level, that would set it appart from the resist bonused ships alot more.
---
Was referring to roaming solo in a stratios or wh roams.

---
i think you are misunderstanding time zone tanking. both parties have their timers in their strongest timezone. tz tanking would be if everyone tossed their timers to be at downtime.
---
Solo isn't going to treat you well. 
---
Pretty much everyone just lights a cyno and drops capitals on you. Trying to find others doing something is even harder as everything in consolidating under super umbrellas. Lowsec is dead, Almost all of null is dead, WHs are full of capitals now. 
---
Amazingly, the vast majority of content is in highsec. This was clearly intended and not a side effect of poor choices. Trust me on this one. Trust the upvotes. The upvotes never lie.
---
Too bad the show's writing is horrendous.
---
Waiting impatiently for The Expanse season 4 instead.
---
blames waffles for the batphone \^_^
---
Put it in some quiet lowsec system. At a not really good moon outside of dscan range of any gate. Check how long the maximum time from shield ref to armor timer is. Never put up jobs which are longer and make sure you deliver them. Accept that the thing will die at some point in time.

Hold up there man, don't be to judgemental.

Don't worry, that replacement is already dead as well and the mobile game with loot crates is in the works now.
---
There are many YouTube tutorials. Even CCP made few introductory videos.
---
You can rat in any afk drone ship and it will still make isk, much less of course, but still do it, so your argument is invalid. Now the VNI "ticks" will be much lower than before, which was kind of the point of the patch.
---
This would be beautiful
---
rip logibro
---
Have you seen any data to indicate that leaving newbros out of fleets and allowing them to solo leads to player retention?
---
Are you implying there is no stalemate or need for a change ATM?
---
If yes to the above, what do you propose is a better idea?
---
If you don't like an idea, fair enough. 
---
Try to value add in a discussion, have a suggestion, alternative or alteration in mind.
---
I'm basing my request on what data the data indicates around retaining players and the core of Eve gameplay.
---
Where, it has been observed that players that choose the solo experience are less likely to remain within Eve.
---
I understand you need a space for solo, it will still be there after this change is made. Unfortunately, you may need to feet up at least once if the faction has allowed all of their systems fall.
---
Would your faction be asking too much of you to get you in a fleet... Say... Once a year? They would only need you to not solo if they had already lost all the systems they could and needed every last man to push back... On what planet does that sound bad?
---
Here I'll fix it for them. You are fucking stupid and coming across as the kind of person who likes the taste of windows.
---
Queue that video of the old guy playing Pokemon Go on 50 phones only farming isk for PLEX.
---
Imagine the sheer amount of inflation it would generate! We'd be looking at TRILLIONS for anything of value with that level of farming available.
---
we cant see your fucking score

I was in Detorid and up through Cache. My usual "working from home, take a couple jumps on breaks" RUTZ / EUTZ stomping grounds. Far less content post VNI change. Usually I get anywhere between a couple and 10 vnis in an hour, today I saw exactly two subcap ratters, both in things that could rat aligned. About 50 supers tho.
---
Nerf cyno brigade. Ok these are folks that used to outnumber everyone with capitals and could jump them across the Galaxy at will and kill anyone they chose.
---
Nerfs and timers later: They cannot, and they are no longer the big dog. Now they lead the "cynos are too powerful, they dropped caps in their own space, it's not fair" movement.
---
It is a nerf.  Had they buffed the turrets and left it with 2 though...

Fairly. Most fits are kinda blingy, so rare to see but they pop up now and then

Clash of Clans IN SPACE! has potential... Throw waves of capsuleers in different ships that cost more or less depending on how effective they are... Spam noob ships as the basic soldier, throw in a Raven for long range strikes at slow speeds, toss in a group of Catalysts for a quick burst.... Blow up your opponent's mining fleet on the way out as an extra insult and set them back a day.
---
Oh yes, Scanning 3/5 is one that causes lots of people trouble. The process of scanning is a little hard to explain so you should definitely look at some videos. Press F12 and go to the last tab.

Between this and the [thread about the wormhole corp evicting itself](https://4x.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/chjn5s/wormholer_btw_naturalphenomenon_to_disband_after/), this has been a strong day for hysterically written wormholer AAR's. Well done all around.
---
Here are some resources that will help:
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Scanning
---
This video (3 parts) will probably be the most help: https://youtu.be/bspRKanFo2Y
---
Nope. Flying though large alliance space, their home regions have just as much pve as ever. A few more losses but nothing really changed.
---
Get a probe launcher on your ship if you do not already have one.
---
Load probes into launcher
---
By your ships capacitor (left side) click scan, 4 mini windows should pop-up, click prob scanner. Another window with a map included should have popped-up.
---
If you are in a system that has cosmic anomalies it will show in this window. Watch a YT video on how to scan stuff. 
---
Once you find a data site warp to it and use the correct module on the containers to start the mini game.
---
That is some fucking grand admiral thrawn class strategy. Pretty good

How rude bud...
---
Treat the symptoms and not the cause of the problem, really smart.
---
Do you know what would be smart?
---
* collectd data to identify bots and ban for it
---
* use the data collected from the client to identify users workstations (based on hardware data, things like MAC, motherboard model and bios revision, video card and CPU, all data can be gathered from the OS) and automatically ban new accounts opened from the same pc
---
Nobody except CCP can do this, it's their responsibility, and honestly I don't care if someone would say It cannot be done because nobody outside CCP can access eve sources and say something about it.
---
Do you wanna know what will happen now?
---
Bots will move from VNI to some other ship (Ishtar, myrmidon or dominix or laser ship) and they'll continue to work.
---
Newbies will wait to Gallente cruiser 5 to put their ass on an Ishtar to have a bunch of isk to use for ships, skills, assets and do whatever they want with the subscription THEY paid.
---
Another good push towards plex and injectors, right? Winner winner chicken dinner... 
---
Good job CCP, I have an idea for a new company payoff: "Kick paying customers in the butt because of your management incompetence since 1997"
---
It's probably weighted that way because the Gila exists.
---
Now recreate it all on a Stellaris map and let's see what happens.
---
And who is that?
---
I used to be in brave then dropbaers and atm im more inclined towards applying for test or wingspan... might also just stay freelance with roaming groups
---
Can't read or didn't? I already said I never used it for that. 
---
Actually I checked it still works fine after the nerf for what I do use it for with both my Omegas and Alphas BUT that's not the point. I don't appreciate my toys that I put time and effort into being fucked with. EVER.
---
Like I also said the multiple account guy who told me about the game quit for just this reason some years ago told me all about this sort of thing and he did warn me, but me being me, came to see for myself.
---
Been checking around just for the hell of it. Obviously other than here, more than a few people agree with me. For instance:..oh wait..never mind..go do your own research.
---
Wow someone speaks wisely! Well done!
---
Same, excited for S4
---
Sure you did...
---
However, don't forget that a spinning habitat has to have a certain radius to be livable. On small radii, the linear velocity difference between your head and toes can be too high and lead to all kinds of problems.
---
&gt;like a private warzone between our Blocs with little interferance
---
If only that was actually the case. I used to think about fighting a war like that all the time, but there wasn't much point when anytime we'd do anything threatening, a mail would roll in threatening to burn all our structures to the ground and take our sov.  
---
Looking back on it, we only existed all those years because you guys needed someone to be there as content whenever you wanted to play Eve. In a real total war, there was never any doubt who had the far higher capability to escalate.  
---
tldr; It kinda sucks to be the Washington Generals.
---
&gt;Have you seen any data to indicate that leaving newbros out of fleets and allowing them to solo leads to player retention?
---
How could there be such data when it has never been tried? There is 4% retention now, so it cant really get much worse.
---
&gt;Are you implying there is no stalemate or need for a change ATM?
---
Im saying blobs cause stalemates. We see this in null.
---
&gt;If yes to the above, what do you propose is a better idea?
---
Many things, but it doesnt matter because CCP doesnt care.
---
&gt;If you don't like an idea, fair enough. Try to value add in a discussion, have a suggestion, alternative or alteration in mind.
---
Im adding value by rejecting it. We have not seen CCP being willing to do anything yet, so whats the point?
---
&gt;I'm basing my request on what data the data indicates around retaining players and the core of Eve gameplay. Where, it has been observed that players that choose the solo experience are less likely to remain within Eve.
---
If all you have to make people stay is a glorified chat and "friends", what value does the game add?
---
&gt;I understand you need a space for solo, it will still be there after this change is made. Unfortunately, you may need to feet up at least once if the faction has allowed all of their systems fall.
---
It wont. This change is quite frankly retarded. It is as if the individual doesnt play the game. The absolutely last thing the game needs more of is another push for people to blob up.
---
&gt;Would your faction be asking too much of you to get you in a fleet... Say... Once a year? They would only need you to not solo if they had already lost all the systems they could and needed every last man to push back... On what planet does that sound bad?
---
Why would anyone support an idea that causes more blobs and camps? You are just raising the barrier to entry even more for new players.
---
You fly around different systems to find signatures in space, some of them will be exploration sites.
---
The probes go in a core probe launcher.
---
In space, launch your probes, the alt-p screen will make more sense.
---
In the signature window there is a recall probes button, they auto-recall on docking, jumping, or splashing a wormhole, they apparently can expire in space, I just recall manually  and it's never been a problem.
---
You move your probes over the signatures in the map and scan again, the %s are how close you are to getting a lock of that sig and being able to warp to it.
---
I 100% get your frustration, I let my two main accounts go alpha last week and am running a new toon through the tutorials and carrier agents to see what the new player experience is like, pretending I don't know about anything other than what's presented to me via the in-game guide.
---
It's NOT EASY, very nostalgic, much better than it was in 2007, eve is a info heavy game, and learning some stuff from giudes and wikis related to the activity you are doing is unavoidable. Some of this stuff NEEDS to be in game.

It has 1 less low slow but the same drone bandwidth.
---
I cannot speak to that, but it makes sense.
---
^ is salty because they are still trapped in ualx
---
Tell ya what, figure out a way that I can bring my dual rep brawling vni that worked yesterday and you got a deal.  780dps and 209hp/s with enough cap to keep the reppers running.  Vs 670dps and 284hp/s with 45s of cap.
---
I have more than one Omega dolt! Hmm never called any one dolt before..consider yourself lucky...so what's one of my in game alts? Hmm? Since you claimed you know. Oh by the way you didn't think I post on here from my gaming comp did you?
---
Watched first episode. Devoid of logic, uninteresting and plain stupid.
---
I agree, but what I do try to do is to find the most safe way to make isk(and I suck at that) to have isk for pvp. And no I won't join them, but I do understand all the Krabs. 
---
Even if you hack or exploit, if someone changes the game so it doesn't work. You get pissed. 
---
You won't get all players happy, it's about keeping most of the paying customers.
---
Sure, but it only has 75mbit/s bandwidth now. So an effectively 40% drone damage nerf as it can only field 3 heavies as opposed to 5; with the rest of the damage being moved toward using guns (ie: to make it less AFK-able so you have to be an active participant in flying the ship outside of warp, orbit, drop drones, netflix).
---
It sucks. Everyone is stupid and unprofessional. Physics is meaningless
---
It still works fine for what both my Alphas and Omegas use them for but that's not the point.
---
I believe you have to post even to transfer.
---
We love our herons. Got a ton of vids of them getting us fun fights. Here's a Heron going after ventures, a tristan, and then 2 drakes: https://youtu.be/hgahzg8zdDE

It's also another one of those facts..,exactly the same only a certain percentage of the population is fully ambidextrous. That means able to use both hands equally well, in case you're from Rio Linda.

---
No way man, I logged, activated my hack and jumped to my fort before I had even materialized. Literally there was just no time to do anything else. It was completely unfair.
---
&gt;Dread fights are retarded waste of isk 90% of the time
---
Naw, man, it's good when shit explodes. Especially fights like this where shit exploded on both sides.  
---
You know all that talk against Eve players being too risk-adverse? This is a great example of that. Most players actually want to be in battles just like this one, but yet you consider the FC as having made a mistake and "wasted" ISK.  
---
And hearing that from one of the leaders of your group (you), he'll be more careful next time, and another fight like this is less likely to happen. In a fight where your side held the field and won the ISK war.  
---
Can't you see that attitude is exactly what everyone around here says is strangling the life out of Eve?
---
I wonder if it wouldn't be better to remove FAX ships, move the triage module to the *supercarriers* and then bring back their old mothership designations because that's basically what the rework would make them, classic sci-fi motherships.
---
The next question is what you'd do with the FAX hulls now that their role is gone. It would be a shame to not reuse them in another role, but for the life of me I can't think of what that role would be.
---
This also brings up something that I've been confused about for a while now; why aren't battleships considered capital ships? I'm not advocating for them to be classified as such, it's just that I've always found it weird that battleships - who basically fit the definition of "capital ship" to a T, alongside carriers - are classified as subcapital ships in the EVE universe unlike every other sci-fi universe I can remember.
---
Yeah...as I've said, it'll be as effective as the War on Drugs,which as mentioned elsewhere only increases the cost of doing business by about 10% BUT costs much more than it stops. That being said, if any you lot want to believe in CCP on the matter, help yourselves...I find your faith amusing.
---
Not sure why people stopped AFK ratting during Blackout. If you're AFK, you're not watching local by definition of being AFK.
---
Nope but I'm thinking of siccing a band of Satin worshipers  on some people here. Buy two curses and get one for free!
---
What the actual fuck is this reply? This entire post screams of entitlement. 
---
Your absence will likely go unnoticed. o7
---
5% Drone tracking
---
10% Drone hitpoints, damage, and mining yield.
---
So they added 5% more drone tracking, 10% bonus to Medium Hybrid Turret damage and tracking speed, and  7.5% armor repair per level.
---
It's now live on TQ.
---
For PvP and non-afk ratters who would have to also use blasters now, yes.

and you do not need FW LP to get myrmidon :-) RIP Gallente FW
---
firstly, capital mods are huge, so you cant take them with you and refit on the fly. active and buffer fits also often have different rigs, so you cant use the same hull for everything (unless you are fine with replacing capital rigs all the time).
---
what is your intended use for it?
---

I always asked why eve is the only mmorpg where game play does not affect the player level, but you had to wait months to get the most expensive ships and modules... Now in the 2019 they are closing the gap :trollface:
---
This is exactly what I hear every time someone dumb (like op in this case) makes a post about capital proliferation/nerf/cyno's.  
---
People are so fucking dumb it's actually hilarious.

hey now, window lickers have standards too

Huh I've been having a blast in detorid during rutz lately but I might have just been lucky. Of course it helps not being blue to half the people there :D
---
Open a bug report and a ticket
---
I'm mostly wanting to shoot things in lowsec/possibly drop it on other caps if a gang tackles something they can't kill. Not necessarily going to be used in fleets often (no sov warfare planned) so if it's not reasonable to have active and passive both I'd lean towards active, as I expect to have little support most times.
---
Whenever I see you post I can feel my braincells dying, please stop.
---
RIP half of your PVE kills :-D

Satin is alright but I don't know that anyone really worships it.  Maybe if it's a proper silk satin, that's another matter entirely, but your generic polyester or nylon satins?  Nah.

It is meme posts are against sub rules it’s gonna get removed

Had a post of mine (very clever post btw) get removed cus of this faggot rule
---
Should be able to talk to your corp about that.

I’m sure guides exist for high level wormhole running but otherwise you should be fitting and flying in a fleet with your corp.

There isn’t much you can do solo with a dreads besides the wormholes.

8 more carriers and 2 titans dropped with me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ this is Eve online in 2019.

Seems like they buffed it too much surely? Don’t all the other navy ships have only two bonuses?
---
May want to do some searching and asking find a LS Corp or Alliance that does similar INDY stuff and see if they have a reactions tower you can get rights for use, or just join them. I was in a corp, inside of an alliance that lived in a lowsec pocket that had a few moon mining platforms along with 1 anth for reactions. It didn't get a lot of use, I might have been the only toon using the reaction array, but staging out of a 3-4 system lowsec pocket gives you easy access to C2's that chain into bigger holes quite quickly. I would join in on the ice mining ops or donate PI to help cover the cost of keeping the reaction array online. It was really easy to scan down a hole, hoover up the C2 gas and move through the rest of the chain hoovering. I would run a few BIG reactions at the start of each month to align with where the current market was. Was a pretty easy way to make a little extra cash. Just make sure its a reaction that has trading volume. I found some of the reactions are SLOW to sell... especially now with the 0.01 bot meanance.
---
IIRC they did a bunch a couple of years ago of really old ones so it's possible.
---
It'd be cool but, code.. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

---
Accept the fact that you can’t hide. In WH everyone is using probes, and in K-space, all you need to do is open the in-game map and look for industrial index of reactions (if it’s anything but null, there’s an active refinery in system).  I’d say go for it and anchor your refinery, and use it at max while it lives.  You’re gonna be glad you did it instead of cowering. And if you end ISK positive after your refinery is dead, you did it right. Also when they come for you, don’t be cheap : do your best to give them the good fight they want.  Everyone will be happy.

Nice touch by CCP to allude to this in the Hurricane Fleet Issue's description

Learned it from one of my Professors at University. He used to do it verbally only to those traveling missionaries who pop up at your door from time to time. I thought it wouldn't work in print and I must admit, until you, it always has.

All the other navy ships aren't trying to split their DPS over two weapons systems.

There may be others out there, but those are the only two I've seen from that particular series FWIW.
---
Back to ishtar then. Only slightly more expensive to fit one.
---
VNI 4x DDA fit  
---
DPS prepatch - 5x berserker -  648 dps  
---
DPS afterpatch - 3x berserker - 389 dps  
---
Myrmidon (3x DDA) - 4x berserker - 490dps  
---
Gila (3x DDA) 2x Valkyrie - 490dps (539dps with Augmented Valkyrie)  
---
-&gt; and with just 400dps, you do not get over 9m TIKs
---
I expected an old titan in the post
---
Cry more, the game won’t miss you when you quit
---
Hey. You should get a hold of jim or Seth.
---
411 or 422 dps in my vni fit if your only getting 389 its probably just skills
---
Damn. Wish I could’ve been that lucky. Good job dude.
---
[Oh no](https://i.imgur.com/4CpdYC9.jpg)
---
Starship citizen is just a cheap knockoff of rocketship resident.
---
And now a rorqual is dead because you over responded to a single cruiser.
---
I never said it was optimal, I did say boters will probably just keep using vni's and so will a bunch of players because it still works for afk ratting.
---
Clearly if your not going to go afk then you might as well use the domi.
---
So you won't 100% know where you're going?
---
Nullsec alliances have their own automatic intel tool for reporting neutrals. You can set an alarm sound if a neutral is reported x jumps out. During blackout it won't work anymore.
---
Buffed into not being able to run dual reps long enough to empty an ancil?  Buffed by losing 100dps?  I don't think that means what you think it does.
---
Haha thanks!
---
&gt;Belko watched him for 3 weeks 
---
You spent 3 weeks trying to kill a capital that can be replaced in 3 hours?
---
I think bottlenecks would occur due to New Eden's population and their lack of hyperdrives; decent ones can let you move the radius of the SW galaxy in about a day, if you're using a major trade route. Keep in mind that the entire cluster is about 100ly across, and that moving across it with any speed requires stargates or jump drives.
---
There's also how the Star Wars EU contains some rather scary stuff in it. If they got pressed into taking the gloves off, I think it would get *extremely* ugly for both sides.
---
Nah
---
Write a bot that uses the Navy Omen...it will get re-balanced faster that way.
---
With the amount of sperg being posted about this, I can only assume that the people with enough brain cells to realize CCP’s analytics are more granular than just concurrent users are just not posting. 
---
It’s not difficult for them to filter out all the people that just logged in to kill a rat and then logged out. That sort of information is even trivially available through ESI, which is probably nowhere near the resolution of whatever internal tools they have to monitor activity.
---
With the recent nerf to VNI, what is the now current meta for ratting and salvaging for fittings of both ships?
---
"ironically" the nerf is an indirect buff to super ratters because now there's less isk generated which makes super ratters' isk printed more valuable. Supers can still keep printing isk pretty much risk free.
---
Elaborate
---
Naaaaah
---
I have been too. The only people in that TZ that even touch Detorid that I'm blue to are XiX. It's just been today, where I barely saw a single subcap. Not that punching free vnis in the nuts is the most engaging pvp either, but I find it hard to get more unless I go roam to horde space or ustz provi or something.
---
Explain in great detail with out the n, a, or h in your response
---
iS HE WRONG THO?
---
You can say that about any isk-generating activity.

No I didn’t say that.
---
I don't think there is a single dominant ship right now, which is a good thing for the game but it makes it pretty hard to answer your question. You'll get people suggesting a variety of other drone boats (since drones are still very good for PVE).
---
I was not aware that there was any desire to improve character animations. Don't they only exist in the character creation screen?
---
And an MJD often.
---
I was trolling a bit. However I did not mention ratters. That was yours, and your subconscious shows how you really feel. Very illuminating....
---
are you aware how easy it is to roll a hole? this would allow nullsec entities to create permanent portals to anywhere else in nullsec.
---
🦀🦀🦀 NO NEW SKILL WILL EVER PASS THE POLL 🦀🦀🦀

Rip the animated login screen and the jukebox o7
---
And the belt is not always there, you have to wait for the frack, so once in a while you have ore as nice as null not daily.
---
Myrmidon for ratting. Fitting depends on where you live, ask your alliance
---
With that armor rep bonus there botters will be more tanky if there active fit
---
Try going into program files/ your C drive and deleting some .dll files.
---
Hey bb ;)
---
I missed that - what did they do?
---
They won’t give it back, probably assume you sold it for RL money. Also they lack the staff so..
---
&gt; The goal of your proposal is some conflict focusing &amp; interesting new plex resources
---
Nope, *you didn't get the goal at all*.
---
The goal is to introduce a Geography so that Location-specific bonuses can be introduced.
---
In the actual system, if you give a bonuses to local production to a specific system, that system will just be zerged the very next day and that's it, no *strategy*, no planning, no interesting choices.
---
With a frontline, you have to plan the route toward that system, you have to plan the logistic routes, the enemy can cut that route and can fortify that system etc... Largely more interesting.
---
&gt; As far as mining, resources, see the discussion on moon mining &amp; tying facwar space moons to facwar.
---
Wow woow,
---
I don't care about mining specifically, I care about the space where you can introduce capture bonuses that can benefit more than FW Soldiers, that's all.
---
Good that you have a discussion on it, but it doesn't really matter to my proposal.
---
Well what do ya know lol
---
That’s what Goon has always done. Carriers put way more DPS out even with a “economy” fitting than any battleship, have way more tank, and are just about as easy to manage as a krab. They’re also a lot less expensive than a blingy rattler. 
---
The real issue here is the mechanics of PvE are mostly so boring no one wants to actively do them. Why are there huge fleets or AFK rorqs? Because mining is fucking boring. Why are there botting VNIs auto running sites? Because they’re boring and repetitive. CCP could fix this by using even semi-procedurally generated sites where the triggers weren’t always the same, the ship comps were different and more threatening (based on meta data of what players were using most in the region), and the AI actually behaved more like a player instead of something with the same intelligence level of a bird attacking a mirror. 
---
In other words the issue is that CCP hasn’t given a shit about making PvE content that is anything other than necessary to fuel PvP content.
---
Hey would one of the haters please tell me at what point y’all will acknowledge the fact that frat is getting their front door kicked in.  Asking for about 28,000 friends.  Pretty sure all of the fighting is being done in frats space to the point now they’re moving to fucking perrigen falls so they can krab in peace under the Panfam umbrella.  2 ihubs now in detorid.  Think it’s over a dozen total from scalding and wicked. 
---
Or do y’all just hate tapi so much it wouldn’t matter how many systems fall before you give an ounce of credit.
---
First thing that came to mind was that! lol
---
Wait, now we have a empire faction cruiser with 3x bonus? That is not quite that fair with all the other faction hull...
---
At least this may very well be a prediction to the future, something we will see EVENTUALLY with all faction ships.

---
This works in lore, as Sansha's can create wormholes so I'm sure there's some way to come up with that capsuleers could get it. However it sounds like a terrible idea as a game mechanic.
---
Well, since he’s in Horde, he’d probably want a hole leading to the ratting systems of goons and Goonswarm aligned coalitions.
---
Just give it a big drone bay.
---
They Killed it bc we like it.
---
You left an n in there!
---
As punishment you must watch jita local for an hour!
---
For some reason, there isn't a clear place that the game points you to this, but there are in-game videos that have people explaining these systems. There's a whole tutorial on scanning.
---
Click on the menu on the top left, then click help. (Or press F12). Then click the tutorial videos tab. This explains all these mechanics.
---
Well fuck
---
im new to eve online just started playing was focused did not notice that a general manager from the game was messaging me if i needed any assistance.  
---
never had that happen before in any game.  
---
i guess all i can say is the kindness and support from the staff of a game i played like an hour or so so far is unmatched they also gave me some skins and other stuff :)  
---
no troll new to eve again thank you
---
Arancar, my dude!
---
Good choice of tunes
---
Is the VNI the most used ship by AFK ratters and Bots ?
---
Hey love, how's the old crew doing?
---
Yea I guess I'm gonna log in as alpha at some point to check shit out :)
---
it does make more sense to install wh-generator upgrade in every Ihub in a single or even multiple constellation and then randomly having a non-stopping wh spawn rather than point your titan volunteraly on grid especially due "delayed local". The first one is undesired in k-space due to having more entrances to the system than a cheddar and  there are plenty of reason having a wh break in a system for non-pvp activities. 
---
NPC null and low-sec would benefit of such wh-generating titans for pvp content...however I haven't seen anyone stupid enough to even do ratting in those in mentioned areas.
---
Undoubtly that wh-groups would appreciate the gesture, however if you really into it just move to a C3 static null same effect less upfront costs(not even mentioned the possibility to move one inside - if you are at this point we have other problems due gameplay balance - such a group would be too powerful).
---
Wow, good show Sojun!
---
If you read CCP's reasoning, their goal isn't to make the VNI bad at ratting just make it so it's not the cheapest best easiest to bot option in 100% of scenarios.
---
"Why would anyone support an idea that causes more blobs and camps? You are just raising the barrier to entry even more for new players."
---
I would say that based on the data, players face a greater barrier to entry into Eve Online when approaching the game as a solo operator with no prior experience.
---
I would say, that the data indicates that being in feets is removing that barrier of entry.
---
"How could there be such data when it has never been tried? There is 4% retention now, so it cant really get much worse."
---
This is absolutely true.
---
What this indicates however, is that overall, the best case scenario for no change = a continuation of the 4% retention rate.
---
That same data cites that players that participate within a community represent the largest portion of that current 4% (or retained players)
---
It is therefore irrefutably logical to extrapolate the following:
---
If you don't socialise a player... They have less than a 4% chance of sticking around to be your content.
---
Conversely, if you do, they have up to a 4% chance of sticking around.
---
(With no changes made)
---
Do you now see the point?
---
Potential elite NC recruit right here.
---
end game crisis starts and everyone is too dumb to do anything and will get steamrolled unless you do everything
---
Here's some stuff I found in a similar style but not the same set or anything.

we agree having only 3 mid slots on alot of the amarr vessels in small gang and solo is very hard for Amarr ships they are still good in certain ways but Amarr is the most powerful in fleets hp wise as they have fattest tanks.on comms me and a few other solid pvpers and a few free thinkers discussed builds meta and ship designs just between us we came to the conclusion as to not lose the depth of the lore and difference in the 4 main faction.
---
main bonuses for all Navy Vessels should be
---
Gallente - armor rep bonusAmarr - Hit point Bonusminmitar - velocity bonuscaldari - shield rep bonus
---
long story short that is some of the things we discussed but we can only dream ;) Eve will continue to evolve and whether we have this love hate relationship for it most of us will still be there ready to PEW o7
---
Momma didn't raise no quitter
---
nice, I really like the algos one, thanks :)
---
In before "sharing GM communications. Ban inc."
---
In practice this concept would be terrible.
---
CCP would suddenly have to manage many more ship variants and players would game the system.
---
Any balance decision becomes a question of whether its Ishar v1,v2 or current that is unbalanced. The number of interactions between different ship types drastically increases.
---
And power blocks would just print out 10,000-100,000 ships if they are considered overpowered to gain an edge after they get nerfed.
---
We know. It can’t fit a covop cloak

Welcome to EVE !
---
Quiet, but we've got some rumblings going recently; throw me a PM, we'll get you back in the discord fold at least :)
---
Are you ok? 
---
There are plenty of memes here.
---
hey
---
so Jim's been kind of rebooting BAERS recently so you could actually just rejoin. They're in BRAVE again, so you can just casually do things with BRAVE/Legacy. They also have a wormhole thing going again though, so if you want to get back into that you can do that too.
---
If you don't want to go to wormhole space, a few ex-BAERS are in TEST at the moment, although we're all focused on different things and not really doing things together much.
---
There's also the guys that went to PL, but I think they're *mostly* inactive right now.
---
Other than that you can find one or two ex-BAERS members in just about any major wormhole corp. If they remember you, they'll probably help you get in.
---
THOR opened up another dropbears refugee camp lol
---
Was that the same patch that made each t2 mining drone mine like a t1 barge? That was a great couple weeks for my alts that actually trained and used mining drones whiel everyone else scoffed them.
---
not sure changing a ship for any reason related to botting is a valued move given bot's can just do everything we can do but better.
---
Also not sure changing the ship to give players more options is a good move either although I do get it, there are a bunch of really niche ships in the game that ccp planned for, whats the difference here, is it because it was something players came up with I dont know.
---
Anyway, this post wasnt about why the patch was done, I just wanted to point out to the people in the other thread saying vni pve is dead, its really not dead, its just a little less isk, and if the goal for the player is to be afk then its still going to do its thing.
---
There are a few recommendations that are given to newbros:
---
1. Don't fly what you can't afford to lose. Ships should be thought of as ammunition
---
2. Find something you enjoy doing and find people to do that with.
---
3. Never stop asking questions. 
---
If you need to know how to do anything, you can look it up on Eve Uni's wiki, they have articles on every activity in Eve

"I've kept a few dozen or more people babbling all day for several man-hours with maybe 15 minutes of effort on my part, so...well...you figure it out."
---
I figured it out. You're crying about how it's not fair and about the removal of an abused mechanic. The babbling amounted to a few dozen people calling you a whining idiot and reinforcing the opinion that you came across as an entitled little bitch. Sounds like you need to figure it out. 
---
Your replies paint you as a caricature of an MMO playing neck beard on the internet. Maybe that's the bit, idk.
---
Also I'd be careful crediting yourself with "effort", set your bar low enough and it might become your reality.
---
Wait until someone kills you the first time and after that sends you some isk and a pm how to do better.
---
Aww shit here we go again.... Ishtars online it is.

You can always tell when someone is lying when they go into amazing detail of every second after they found out they where banned.

Oooooo so I’m seeing that null lost local and that was kind of fun. Now you want to rage roll for content too. Only a matter of time before all of EVE gives up on k-space and comes where the grass is spookier! :)
---
Cool idea though. My dream module idea is: combat tractor beam!
---
Yes. Join a bunch of boring neckbeards that sit out in the middle of bumfuck nowhere mining rocks. That is sure to keep people interested in the game.
---
This is a thing the gm's do for new players. Eve is typically incredibly freindly to newbros since you remind us old bittervets of the time before our hearts hardened into a calicifed knot of ice and spite.

Thank you! It will be a long ass time before I go try to go near wormhole space tho
---
Caps should be a pain in the ass for subcaps to kill true.
---
But caps shouldn't be as overwhelming as they are now. The game was designed around caps being a rarity. Now they are as common as a frigate. Just ask any mega alliance in this game.
---
So yeah caps need to reflect how commonplace they are now. Designed with a giant deathball in mind rather than just a single overwhelming force.
---
And yes I know CCP made some strides in that direction but instant locking carrier camping being a thing shows they have a long way to go to make them more balanced.
---
Good show guys !
---
that is trash dps mate, the patch did its job
---
Thanks man! Of course you guys have your own university and Wikipedia lol 
---
I’ll be reading this in work tomorrow
---
The best way to kill domis is to shoot them until they are dead, I find.
---
It's not that simple bro, a million idiots buy apple products by the same logic
---
first of all, yeah, its not the 600 odd that the vni used to do..
---
what in your opinion was the purpose of the patch.
---
Actually, the rotating sections of the rings in EVE are far too narrow to be useful for human occupation. The whole ring is more designed to emulate designs for the [Alcubierre Drive](https://images.app.goo.gl/YATxc4sgfm8Br3sF6), a theoretical warp drive that EVE's warp engines are based on in canon.
---
ice? fucking carebears, just delete eve
---
They've done this at least the last several years
---
:=D
---
To stop people earning so much isk from afk ratting with a VNI.
---
I don't care either way, i would rather kill a VNI than a myrm or domi any day as its [easier](https://zkillboard.com/character/2078987361/).
---
Keep trying new things, its a big game you may like mining you may like pvp you may like explo but you will never know if you don’t try.              
---
                
---
As for PC, Alienware is expensive for what it is, eve doesn’t need bleeding edge graphics so you don’t need to go nuts.  Self build is usually much cheaper
---
I am there prime target customer in that case! 
---
Anything u would recommend instead? my budget for the pc itself excluding the monitor n shit is £2000 so like $2450 dollars
---
Hey buddy, 
---
First welcome! Secondly, I’m sitting on a Mac too and don’t want to get a separate pc just for eve. However, eve on Mac is basically just a windows emulation via wine. You can get a significant performance boost by running it native under windows via bootcamp and your 4 year old Mac should handle that with no issue whatsoever.

---
Yes, pirates shoot my Hobgoblin II more often than my Hobgoblin I.
---
Nicely done. However, not gay enough
---
Are you based in the UK? 
---
I’ve bought my rigs from overclockers.co.uk for many years. They have a great team working there and will happily help you spec out a pc that suits your budget and gaming needs. Long term I still use them as if anything goes wrong, even out of warranty they’ve always helped me sort things out.
---
upvoted for Stacmon
---
Not much to chew on here for all your talk of there being discussions.
---
OK, that's a prety decent reason, but it does not seem to be the reason most of the community thinks they did it for.
---
no bait you have to always discuss current meta builds and ideas with your friends otherwise you wont evolve to much in any game as stated just an idea we discussed.
---
Oh man, that sounds all kinds of bad. Like sea-sickness, turned up to 11. What, realistically, would happen in that situation? Would you even be able to stay standing?
---
Games master :)
---
Long story short ;)
---
how about a navy Mael, Rokh, Abaddon, and -insert gallente ship here-
---
or a Naga with missiles &lt;.&lt;    (i still salty over this)
---
Downvoted for Gallente
---
Is this recent? Warping to something in the sun should no longer bounce you out.
---
GSF is reimbursing myrmidons now, so you can literally fit a ratting myrm, insure, warp to a site, and get killed by a hunter and get srp'd almost completely. I think if you get 1 tick you break even.
---
Delusion and proliferation of shitty information and opinions from people who rarely undock has always been a very EvE thing.
---
Now that was anticlimactic as fuck. Waiting 2 minutes for the good explosion and the ship just disappears lol
---
This is old. Get out of here.
---
Well space engineers workshop is FULL of EVE ships (imported 3d models) so making interiors to one isn't that bad {I made succubus once} size will be problem due how HUGE Eve ships are.
---
 Space engineers lags like crazy when you have +500m ship with full interior (block count will make processors cry)
---
Lies! I still dont know if the cat is nice. Or if it likes potatoes
---
Omen Navy is an amazing ship, it's in a really good spot.  Not everything need re-balanced.
---
new vni is dope af
---
The poll should require 92% approval since that's the halfway mark.
---
im just reading about the new vni also and i see it has 3 bonus's to it where every other navy ship has 2 so this does look like a good idea.  
---
bur im newer to the game still always thinking i will never frown upon :)
---
Is the show any good?
---
Heated your probably putting out 3k DPS. Battleships could be viable targets but a blingy well fit rattlesnake should be able to kill you/force you off before his tank breaks. A lot of battleships fit mjd’s. This can be countered with a scram. The only issue is getting into scram range in a battleship can be nasty with lightly tanked ships. Either way good luck hunting !
---
Edit: to add I see a lot of bad fits. If I saw a rattlesnake I’d go for it as you never know
---
That happened in my first week of playing, and it was quite a pleasant surprise for me. Of the half-dozen people who have ganked me without provocation, he's the only one I don't have on my revenge list.
---
Brave spymaster left to form a new player org for goonswarm called Karmafleet, PL copied it later when they found out N+1 is real again because of supercap proliferation (mass supers built because CCP made rorquals mine 3x more than the hulk or something) - they called their version Pandemic Horde.
---
Joining one of those groups might leave you with a market to seed or hub to transport to. 
---
They're also like the 2 biggest corps in the game today although pandemic horde is nearing three times the size of karmafleet, having zero requirements for joining - but PH a way way way worse killboard if that matters.
---
Needs more Racka Puss Puss
---
&gt;  but PH a way way way worse killboard if that matters.
---
Read: the opposite of elite pilots
---
I rat in wormholes and today for some reason the sleepers do focus more on the drones. Warped off repped drones and warped back to the combat site and they left the drones alone this time.
---
Nah, don’t be afraid to go there in a little heron or something. They are unique but good experience on scanning and staying safe.
---
Find a corp you like as quick as you can. It may take a bit to find the right people but Eve is more fun with friends
---
That would be very nice. I'd even settle for a fan-made game using the Tiberium Wars engine or something because ground combat in EVE isn't something that gets a lot of detail.
---
As a point of clarification, are you proposing that, for ship classes that have multiple Navy ships, both ships should share the same main bonuses? Even though the lore explains the differences in some cases (like the Nomen and Slicer being faster to counter their Minmatar enemies)?
---
ree a bit harder brah. Spod bless
---
It's an unpopular opinion of mine that C&amp;C 4: Tiberium Twilight was actually a quite innovative and good game. Admittedly it doesn't fit into the C&amp;C universe and its gameplay is very very *very* different than every other C&amp;C game, but that doesn't make it a necessarily bad game. 
---
The design with different classes was interesting, the idea of unlocking different abilities with some progression was cool, the idea of mobile bases made the game extremely fast-paced, and even the game itself was well-built/optimized software. It was like a simplified version of Homeworld but set in the C&amp;C universe.
---
So it does not "fit" as a C&amp;C game, but it's still a quite good RTS.
---
The recording is done an hour before the post. That Ishkur is still there, you can check it yourself
---
Grey Goo is pretty good for getting your old-school RTS fix.
---
Can confirm ocuk are pretty excellent, I've bought three systems from them over the last decade.
---
that's really nice... I hope they do this regularly with new players. 
---
Just on a side note.... I really hope CCP sees your post as the awesome "free" advertisment for the game that it is... but you have to be a bit careful with sharing conversations you had with GMs or other CCP staff. 
---
Strictly following the EULA, you're not allowed to share any GM convo publicly. I really don't think that this post will be an issue, but you theoretically could get a ban for posting a GM convo.
---
we were just talking cruiser sized vessels there, should say in the description cheers !
---
EVE construction times are fast, but they aren't as ludicrously fast as Command and Conquer, let alone worthy of competing with Total Annihilation.
---
Might be a bug. I've came across it in the past. No one in local besides you, you find a ship in the middle of the sun, you try to approach it and it vanishes, you scan again and find it somewhere close to the sun, you try to approach it again and it warps away and then vanishes completely as if the pilot logged off in space.
---
Haha, all are welcome. Stop by our discord sometime. https://discord.gg/ehsY8Xp
---
So caldari and minnies know how to hide ignition keys to prevent theft? Well now :p
---
I’ve come across ships in the sun twice the last few weeks. Not sure how they do it but probing them and warping to 0 has the same effect - I bounce out.
---
&gt;easy kills
---
Usually means ganking ratters or suicide ganking in highsec, and only one of those greatly benefits from a cloak
---
that would be cool naga doesnt get to much love these days.  
---
i wonder if there is any charts that show who uses mos tof what ship each month
---
I love it on level 3-5 sites.
---
&gt;(atleast i'm not texan)
---
HEY NOW... :P
---
I remember running Eve on my mMac when I first got started. 
---
I’m Mac based for work so when I got my new machine, I picked up a copy of Bootcamp (Parallels would work too) and boot into Win 10 for my gaming. 
---
I spent many a lunch hour and evening reading tons of information on Eve the first couple years I started playing. Be patient with yourself and enjoy the journey. 
---
As for wormholes, there not that scary. PM me if you want and I’ll take you out and show you how to fly safe in all types of space. 
---
I don’t recruit off of Reddit so rest easy, just helping some of Eve’s newest players. 
---
Fly smart!
---
Thanks for the advice mate :) 
---
The performance has been good so far (the fan is loud af but lol) my problem is more i’ve gamed my whole life on console + big TVs and the smaller screen has been a struggle! 
---
But ..... LEARNING HOW TO ZOOM OUT has changed the game! My strength grows by the hour
---
Every event described in this story actually happened.
---
Every quotation appearing in this story is a direct quotation from the person who said it.
---
No character names were made up or changed however many of their titles are probably not official.
---
The reasons *why* the events happened, why the quotes were said, or what I was on when I wrote this, are not  guaranteed to be accurate. I blame /u/Arancar_Aideron for refusing to give me a fact-checking interview because he can't be bothered ~~to set foot outside his Orthrus~~ pause his Factorio world.
---
I know.
---
Cheers lads I’ll give them a good look in work tomorrow!
---
I get what you mean, but like I think that might shoehorn ships into a predictable spot. The joy of PVP in EVE is that you can mix things up and try some weird fit that might actually work.
---
Saying this is this and that is that isn't too healthy for the meta, no offence.
---
Sounds like so much fun.....
---

This is something bots do as well, warp to a BM at the sun so they can't be probed+caught
---

---
I'm extremely new. Can someone explain why the blackout would lead to drone loss?

As Sergeant Schlock once put it, "Sometimes you have fun, and sometimes the fun has you." Players tend not to enjoy it when the latter happens to them.
---
She wasn’t the first she won’t be the last. Always bring the probes, sweethearts.
---
Because you have the potential to go much further without the hassle of scanning for wormholes.
---
I prefer General Manager heh heh

Getting the full CCP experience
---
Good point!
---
It can't fit a covops cloak
---
I’m a newish player and I don’t know about all the free ships and all but Wizard Cat and Pancake Cat are winning me over.
---
I would recommend set it up in lowsec, on a moon and dont run terribly long reaction jobs. double sneaky points if you also run the mining laser and occasionally feed a few t1 mining barges.
---
With the possibility of neuts and an mjd makes it tricky to hold with frigate tackle.
---
Well, that's *one* way to avoid getting blown up while AFK...
---
Good to know- if I opt the c1 route I'll reach out to you!
---
*sniff*
---
What a touching story...
---
&gt; any isk-generating activity
---
The biggest isk faucet in the game is npc bounty, of which anomaly ratting is a major component. Other isk generating activities are largely negligible. Source: monthly economic report.
---
I'm watching it right now!
---
Yes, Karmafleet is for dummies.
---
Also UK based, I’d recommend Overclockers and PCSpecialist, both good companies who know what they’re talking about and don’t try to sell you overpriced shit
---
Upvoted because mad
---
indeed, but i think were headed to something in this degree its looking like as we cant have 3 bonuses on one navy vessel and not the others.  
---
as my build holds dual reps, scram, web, booster, almost 50 k ehp  solid 500+ dps kinda cheesed xD
---
I find it hilarious that the largest single component of the Navitas is a strip club
---
[Clearly](https://zkillboard.com/character/2078987361/)
---
I am continually surprised by the people that I kill or that kill me. So far in my first month or so in the game I've had 90%+ of interactions be super nice. One guy I didnt notice said GF in local after I killed him and I ghosted him, so I opened a convo and I said GF and we talked about the fight, why I won, what he did wrong, and what I did wrong even though I won.
---
In most others games it's instead a response like, "Oi fuck you cunt!" or "Suck my nuts bitch!" or some other variation. I've yet to have that happen in Eve.
---
It just went from being afk to active ratting as far as I can tell, along with brawling pvp being a thing now.
---
LP stores, but jita prices are reasonable for datacores.
---
I would just say to you, anyone that kills you, request a convo. I would say 9/10 times you'll get a friendly response and a nice info dump about what you did wrong.
---
Yea a bare bones Athanor still runs about 185 mill every 30 days, so I'm definitely keeping an eye out on net profit. Hoping PI will offset some costs
---
I don't think you are convincing us otherwise.
---
you can run all the t4s and t5 filiments ( No DARKS ) in a 700 mill isk Gila build i created no implants no boosters i did it live on stream all the 4s then all the 5s one after another.  
---
lie has me busy currently though so i can do edits or reddit once and awhile on train from work
---
Sorry, to reiterate you want mjds on frigates?
---
I had a laugh about it with the guy who pipe-bombed my shuttle with a Hyperion, but another group of players belonged to an alliance whose bio had a "best hits" of aggrieved responses, including one from CCP telling them not to spam the chat so much. I don't want to invite trouble from the latter type of players.
---
I just had this happen to me too! Honestly really great effort by CCP
---
Triglavian Ark sites are trash and shoukd have been done away with since the Invasion was introduced. A waste of a 30m key.
---
Left side bar on the neocom has chat channels. Join the help channel, and feel free to ask any question in there. It was a very helpful tool when I first started in eve back in 2013. Like someone else said, don't fly what you can't afford to lose. And when you do die, and you will to another player, don't get angry and salty, chances are the other player will give you good tips on what to not do next time. Also try joining a player corp, you will learn alot more with other players then you would solo.
---
How many were bots though? How much were the numbers always inflated by bots?
---
A CNC-style RTS set in EVE would be awesome, but there's no way you'd be able to integrate it with the main game because there's no way to control players like RTS units.
---
If you only care about the number of bonuses and not what the actual bonuses are, stop being dumb, please.
---
Because most people who do small scale pvp, they respect skill and desire a challenge. As the saying goes iron sharpens iron.
---
As Falcon once stated, they used this clause for ban *once* since its introduction. It indeed had some very sensitive info from a petition and person posted it in public. An evemail from a gm is okay, I guess.
---
Yeah, I've used pcspecialist for my last 3. Great company.
---
It's not a bad game, but it's a bad *Command and Conquer* game.
---
I heartily endorse this product and/or service!
---
Safe m8
---
I think you can use any alpha level skill you have, even if it's beyond the 5 mil point. You just can't train beyond 5 mil. Using the daily alpha skill injectors, you can train up to 20 mil. I don't know if that's the total of all alpha skills or not though.
---
Alphas are only limited to training up to 5Mn SP through the standard queue and 20Mn through injectors. AFAIK Alphas can use all alpha skills even if the total number of SP exceeds 5Mn.
---
We can all dream...
---
Dummy reporting for doodie!
---
You can only train 5million SP of alpha skills, however you can retain up to 20mil SP of alpha skills after training as omega or injecting.
---

Give it a shot! Eve is hard and I probably wouldn't have stuck it out and learned the ins and outs if I hadn't joined a Corp like KarmaFleet. That's not to say that PH and Brave don't do a good job, I just have no experience being with them.

Go on fleets and be in comms, it's a good time for sure

This is not the case.

---
Lol he rests his case.
---
Yea i could lower the budget for the fitting abit i suppose. But i like to fit a webifier, which means you need abit more bling on the tank items. I also duo box them (as in two characters doing their own T5 at the same time) with netflix on, so i cant have my full attention on one client so i'd rather bling them out abit. I might experiment with some diffrent T5 filaments.
---
I really have to wonder how you'd control units in an EVE strategy game, mostly depending on if the units are players or not. If they're NPCs then it would be Command and Conquer, but if players are the ones controlling the units then you'd have to make it play like Majesty; if you want someone to do something then you have to put a bounty up for it, otherwise everyone just does whatever the hell they feel like.
---
oh ok thank you that's good to know i just thought it was kind an the gaming world should see and take not of how you should interact with your players if able
---
Not only bots. People with multiple accounts bringing life and targets on the field.
---
not anymore, they removed that rule
---
That's true, but you're missing purchasing power vs. inflation. Although this may slow inflation overall, and capital ratting will become a proportionally higher contributor to isk inflation, that's not a "buff" in terms of those doing the activity as the goal is to *make* isk, not to *inflate* the value of isk. You carrier rat to make ticks--not to doggedly ruin the economy little by little like some sort of movie villain.
---
In terms of making isk, there is a whole range of economic activities which are "buffed" because the effect of inflation will be lowered and there will be one less serious competitor method. Each isk being worth more is a matter of purchasing power. You don't need to be generating fresh isk to increase your wallet's value--if I sell something on the market, I have more isk even though it isn't freshly generated.
---
This is actually pretty good, good effort

Roaming around in ships purchased with ratting isk IS fun

The last time they killed me. They send me a message telling to pay isk to mine.
---
Lmao that happened to me once
---
I accidentally deployed mining drones on him and got my shit kicked in
---
More diminishing returns for organisations the larger they get. It's hard to implement, but if it's no longer feasible to just put several full fleets into a system the players will adapt.
---

That's pretty awesome tbh

---
Haha yeah, if I had a ship for every time I did that...
---
The people who wrote the show probably smoked the sandal while writing.
---
Especially #2.
---
When you downgrade from Omega to Alpha, you do not lose any SP in any of the skills you have trained. Your character sheet will still show that you have Cloaking 5 trained, but they will all be kinda grayed out b/c you're not allowed to use that skill at all.
---
If you have Heavy Drone 5, but they've recently decided Alphas can only use up to 3, then those last 2 will still be there, but they'll also be grayed out. Which means when the game calculates the effects, it will be treated as 3 instead of 5.
---
You don't lose SP, you just don't get credit for the levels that are over the Alpha limits.
---
They gave it the specific amount of turret damage that it did to make up for almost exactly the amount of drone damage it lost. So it lost no damage overall but gained a tank bonus. Thats a certifiable buff.
---
I was not involved. At all.
---
it seems like hes basically suggesting that you let a titan give you a wormhole static. rolling your static is how most wh pvp corps generate content
---
Newegg.com, Tiger Direct, buy whatever budget knockoff parts you can. It's all the same power without the brand name. 1400 is solid for a good desktop. For a laptop consider msi and Asus stuff. There has to be a better option than the ones I just laid out. With laptops you can and probably should end up spending more for cooling and a nice screen.
---
It is!
---
I think the hate they get is caused by the personas they adopt when roleplaying, especially the particularly hypocritical and self-righteous ones. That shit is aggravating as hell to me even though I *know* most of it is an act, and I doubt I'm the only one who feels that way.
---
Of course, watching the ones who take it too seriously begin raging when *they're* the ones who end up ganked can be a startling mix of amusing and cringeworthy. Example: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/5ibk8z/to_anyone_that_thinks_code_are_scrubby_pvpers_who/db796x5/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/5igenp/code_salt_best_salt/) [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/5jlmh3/code_salt_best_salt_part_ii/)
---
Good, ccp should take more about the new player like that ; i m sure if they pay someone they will earn his salary more in return. Because 95% player left after 1 month, and in some on them many leave because they are lost lol
---
It would have been too strong of a buff since it can fit 3 mining lasers now.
---
never give up never surrender lol im only 18 as well so im like the next gen :O
---
No U.
---
Eve isn’t really taxing on a computer.  A decent rig with a decent graphics card will be plenty.  Definitely don’t need top of the line stuff.
---
drones are clumsier than lasers though as long range weapons
---
If that is the case, since they just dropped alpha drone skills with the vni nerf, I wonder what they added to make up the 20 mil.
---
Fit ?
---
Why is that? Can you scan down a JF before it aligns and warps?
---
It's about 20m SP to be precise. So yeah, it went down a little bit!
---
A shoebox? Luxury...
---
In 2014 the playerbase was more focused upon fighting battles than industry.
---
It's basicly enforcing Newton's law
---
Yeah, I'd say this is the aim of the shitty log in events, getting/keeping the "unique daily logins" metric high.
---
Congratulations on that Titan kill.
---
My understanding is that you lot derive sustenance from the tears of ganked players, and annoying the fuck out of them results in a tastier meal.
---
I never really understood the mentality that enjoys such things but to each their own, so long as long as you don't go too far with it.
---
&gt; you're missing purchasing power vs. inflation
---
Your understanding is completely wrong and the exact opposite of what happens. When isk generation is reduced people need to provide more goods to exchange for same amount of isk than before. When other isk printing methods are nerfed, super ratters become more exclusive isk printers in the game because they're less affected, and their purchasing power got a buff because of it.
---
heh
---
Believe me, I'm not. Weeks of staying up well into the next morning to find every reffed jammer has been replaced, always flying the same two ships and always being out formed in your enemy's prime time. Finally getting a good brawl and a half and taking a system as a tangible reward is pretty nice in this state of the game.
---
I vote for asset safety. Younger pilots are able to build a Fortizar themselves.
---
That makes it even better lol.
---
They had to add the tracking/damage bonus to guns since they shifted the damage to favor combined guns + drones. It's not getting anything more than the other ships, it's just for purposes of how their bonus mechanics work. The damage/tracking to drones &amp; guns operate effectively as single bonus to Damage + Tracking (and a bit of additional tank for the drones to match the additional tank for the Navy/Fleet ships, since they are essentially an extension of the ship). The Armor Repair bonus would then effectively be the 2nd bonus if you think of the other two as being combined mechanically.
---
Start a convo and get a response like:
---
Git gut scrub lel
---
Weeb
---
I call paid actor here for sure.
---
In most games I'd agree but I've not had that experience very much at all in Eve.
---
No if you get a red sphere from scanning it means the sig is on the far side of the sphere from where you just scanned. 
---
The sig is somewhere on the edge of the sphere but when you load a new system with no scans done it's best to do 4AU sweeps of the planets like comments above say.
---
Anything can be done, there are certain meta things that are better at the moment. It is NEVER to late to play.  Play for free till you feel like it is for you.
