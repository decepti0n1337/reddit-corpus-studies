There is a war going on right now actually. TEST/Legacy/Others vs Frat/Others
---
---
---
Why? I started Caldari and I am switching routes to Amarr because lasers are so much fun and missiles are meh
---
You'll be dropping a dread into a super fight in no time
---
yourrest'r
---
FC or primary, *FC* or *primary*.
---

---
Hmmm...
---
There is no safe way
---
Holy shit, you're stupid...
---
Its true
---
What's "The Fountain 3"?
---
For the mass thing: perhaps you could script it to either give or remove mass, so it can act as either a type of EWAR or something to assist a fleetmate depending on your script
---
Source?
---
Last CSM summit, in the men's room. CCP Fozzie sits to pee, so the CSM didn't know he was in there. They were talking while pissing at the urinal.
---
&gt; The item it produces is less valuable than the input material maybe?
---
Yea, that one I had covered, thanks though.
---
What I was wondering why someone intentionally kept crafting at a loss and/or how someone stupid enough to not calculate his margins can manage to get a t2 bpo or invent at an even bigger loss without running out of cash.
---
So you put together some completely arbitrary stats, and call someone a cheater because you have some personal hate boner for the dude..  
---
Then refuse to even read people's opinions (that you asked for) if they don't match yours.  
---
Sounds Legit..
---
I know there's no safe way, was wondering about the safest.
---
The 3 init guys that got banned by ccp, then unbanned.
---
i mean.. its everyone against test.. so you have to get some allies right?
---
on top of that, test is used to house botters in omist/feytha.. might aswell put some more efficient ones in there
---
You are very welcome. Enjoy the reward.
---
Interceptor with minimized align time (&lt;1.9) and passive shield tank
---
Claws work pretty good in highsec
---
But as you said, no such thing as perfectly safe.
---
I agree I love them too but they just don’t hang in pvp later in the game anymore
---
But what if we we lived in a world without asset safety? Madness I tell you
---
I saw a screenshot where a corp CEO says they have to move to omist with TQ PIBC, otherwise their corp in pibc on serenity will be kicked. 
---
Disclaimer: I haven't, and are not able to testify whether that screenshot is fake or not.
---
But w-we all agree it's gay though, right?
---
while i am here, i'd like to say a big thanks to the corp &amp; alliance i have left within last seven days 
---
barra, u/cap_qu - you two (and hwoever is doing things behind the scenes) have built quite an ingme empire, and i'd like to say i only have fine memories of my time in skill urself (besides initial controversies, which i believe was nothing serious). you two set really high standards of fleet management, not sure i will ever be satisfied if i'll happen to join a bigger blob again. all the best to you and the rest of the alliance &lt;3
---
@vibe, if any of you are reading this - i'll be missing you a lot, you're all great men and i am still kinda gay for targie ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Hey dude. [Dreddit](http://www.dredditisrecruiting.com/) is a newbie-friendly corp, and yes, we offer free frigates to help you join fleets or make ISK.
---
While most of us are more mature players, there's no rules stopping you from joining as an underage player.
---
We have a Discord you can [join](https://discordapp.com/invite/eeCX7ch). Feel free to PM me, though since this is a recruiting alt I might not respond that quick.
---
Try posting in /r/evejobs too, they're more for recruiting.
---
Customer Service V comes first!
---
One thing that really frustrates me is how armor tanking does not really stack up to shield so amarr are kind of hosed on both fronts. You need transversal to win fights and if you are moving to fast with lasers your don’t hit. And if you stop so you can damage you lose the tank battle
---
while people are complaining for many of the things in eve, i decided to renew my subscription for another year although it is super expensive due to currency exchange. (approx 4x of what you guys are paying). but hey, i still love this game and ccp can have my money (◕‿◕✿).
---
I saw a nude of your sister. May be fake but I can’t testify if it was or not.
---
At least the new player experience has improved *massively* since I started about 11 years ago.
---
Instawarp hecate maybe. But your issue is gonna be smartbombers and dying while trying to dock
---
I just started too and feel like I missed out on those feels. I’m too old to spend hours and hours grinding so I bought 500 PLEX to not have to worry about that. The thing is, now missions mining and such are pointless until I can get really nice ships. Which I can buy, but can’t fly. So I’m kind of just sitting around waiting for my skill tree to catch up to my bank. Better than grinding that entire time I guess.
---
It sucks because the Corp I am in is doing all this cool stuff, roams etc. but I can’t participate in a meaningful fashion for another few months, unless I spent an actually significant amount of money on the character bazaar which I don’t want to do. 
---
I spent an hour ferrying fully decked out Tristans to a FW area with Drones V trained. So I’m going to be trying that out tonight. Hope it’s fun!
---
There are industrialists who mine their own materials.  In their mine, they would rather convert their minerals at a product and then transfer that.  They don't like to transport minerals.
---
Test could certainly do with more allies, what with only having goons.
---
And Omist is fine botting country.
---
If you could time travel, when would you go?
---
How do you know he wasn't pooping
---
The fact that you don’t realize a massive war is currently building up right now is enough to show that you have no idea what you’re talking about
---
\&gt; complains about CCP withholding info
---
\&gt; withholds info until tomorrow to get a twitch channel viewership
---
Inn is fake news homie but do watch your in game hands though
---
\*Cries in capsuleer\*
---
A module that will progressively impede assistance would be so cool. Like any kind of assistance, wether reps or capacitor transfer, or even remote tracking computer gets progressively silenced would be really legit.
---
I think it makes sense for triglavian ewar to directly counter triglavian weapons.
---
   
---
A mod that reduces the enemies damage, the effect ramping up over a few cycles to say around a 30% reduction per mod.
---
One of the best features is notifying when it disconnects with the phone. This has saved me from forgetting my phone a good number of times and ive read others who have similar experiences at places like bars. As well being able to answer the phone from my wrist is really helpful while driving(I've never liked headsets). Helpful if you drive a lot as apart of your job. Similar to smartphones in general, it's not necessary, it's a tool if it helps you, and most people like to brag about it.
---
believe it or not, market manipulation exists in other mmo's too. although in your usual mmorpg its much simpler and people who do it there won't have much fun with it in EVE.
---
Nice screen shot..........
---
Yea, but we're still talking about a T2 bpo, someone not willing to calculate his profits is not going to come in a situation where has that entire chain going by himself.
---
Burn out tank or wepons lets not go full cancer
---
Is this an eve meme on tiktok?!
---
The reason we are not having any serious fighting is because panfam has insulated themselves from Imperial legacy attacks by puting AU/Chinese TZ groups between them and their enemy. GOTG and Winter Co.
---
It works but its only a temport solution. Soon Imperial legacy will have enough strength in that TZ to break that line and then its back to good old large scale wars. (PIBC maybe helping there)
---
there are lots of wars going on right now, but you're talking about evicting one of the three powerblocks. The thing is, there is nothing to gain from taking space today. CCP have removed all content drivers that used to be there. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt; goons and legacy VS everyone Else
---
This would literally be a few titan 12hrs tidi parties, followed by weeks of structure bashes that would burn out even the most autistic of us. "everyone else" would loose, not even a challenge. Imperium alone can take on "rest of eve" alone atm. 
---
What we need are incentives to live more spred out, and we need actual benefits from taking sov. Right now TCUs are fucking pointless and Ihubs are meh, all you really need are citadels
---
For real. I haven't really played since the BoB/ISS/ETC days and even I can smell it.
---
Have you not been paying attention to code?
---
It’s been like this for a while. I can’t honestly tell the difference anymore.
---
Does a hecate tank 3 smartbomb racks? (I dont even know what the mode would be to get instawarp so...
---
It's likely why I'm biased in favor of running more support roles granted, but even with like your standard alpha doctrine you at the very least have to shoot at something ( granted if you have more then 30 dudes in a fleet it generally becomes boring for dps and logi really ), but you can move out of the main roles and find a niche where you get to use your brain.
---
With ravens there really is no such niche you either flying a command destroyer and pressing you 1 button when told or flying a raven and pressing your 1 button when your guns are done reloading.
---
just cloak a falcon, and have an mjd on ur ship
---
Nah team, your mother secured that for me ages ago... matter of fact; how old are you?!
---
The gayest one.
---
I lied. I feel bad.
---
The format just hit me. LOL. I've seen the meme floating around so I just did it. Maybe I could start a trend.
---
Oh ok i didn't know that's what they were called.
---
2003 player here, still lurk from time to time.
---
Fake news. There aren't urinals at CCP HQ.
---
Lol wtf. 100% uptime?
---
&gt;Your stupid
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IELcBwoh5KY
---
The HK/sound version had higher Ehp ravens and hacs and logi in the mix ( traded for dps ) and had smart bombs in there utility high. 
---
what I call the HK/sound version is the one used against hole sale. 
---
What I call the init version is the Remote armor repair version. terms might be a bit vague to be fair.
---
Oh yeah I remember when a Oracle was a huge investment for me. And i wanted it rly badly for a fun roam.
---
Theese days i hve more caps than i can count. Its kinda insane how massivly times change in eve.
---
Our site was down for a few days due to a server error at the host end. Guy threw a fit.
---
Join the cool roams in tristans!!!
---
Oh sorry. Your grammar lead me to believe you required 100% uptime on your services by new members.
---
Shut up it was me.

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDY\_Industries,\_LLC\_v.\_Blizzard\_Entertainment,\_Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDY_Industries,_LLC_v._Blizzard_Entertainment,_Inc.)  is a summary of the judgement against him in favor of Blizzard for selling the Glide bot.
---
He is far from new to the scene and more information is easily found. He has many videos on YouTube (if you'd care to look, you probably won't) where he talks somewhat openly about it, though his openness is more of a bad string of rationalizations for cheating. As someone who was in a high-end raiding guild in WoW back then, I remember well the problems with RMT, gold farming sweatshops and bots in that game, particularly Glide which was quite popular and Blizzard went on jihad against. 
---
But no no no, continue to bitch and moan on reddit about bots, RMT and the dirty Chinese in Eve Online while you give this sack of shit more cash. You totally won't be a hypocrite at all.
---
$20 USD may not be a lot for those living in the US but it can represent a lot of money to people living in the rest of the world.
---
Don't forget that a presumably large amount of players now are unpaid alphas, too, making it even worse than it looks.
---
Okay. That definitely didn’t happen.
---
No they don't. Literally never seen that done by a competent corp
---
When are people going to stop trying to use this excuse?
---
I see. I am legit happy to reverted back to me with decent info. I eat my hat.
---
Not literally - that would be insane
---
Meh
---
Though this rumor has been denied by AOM, it existed for a couple of days and haunted the whole Chinese community. 
---
There was an indirect source.  a ping from Chinese northern coalition. (yep, frankly speaking, NC is a little ordinary name)
---
Chinese NC had a alliance meeting several days ago to announce marching to TQ too.  Then a ping (from its CEO? ) leaked yesterday, saying all members who were already in TQ should move from Delve(maybe a goon friend could confirm this) to Omist immediately and join a new alliance created by Chinese NC which was a part of AOM. And it also said if he who pinged the message above refused to do so, would be blocked from the Chinese PIBC's ACL in SQ which means losing his assest. 
---
Yep, an indirect source, still denied by AOM who just acts like an authoritarian government.
---
I mean anyone will tell you that with 150b, you can make a WAY better profit than 18b over a YEAR doing pretty much anything else.
---
I unironically watch Markeedragon when I want to know what eve plebs are doing.
---
Easy. Markee Dragon’s followers are typically AFK miners as thats what he does. AFK miners AFK mine and watch Markedragon AFK.
---
Don't eat your hat. Unless its made of bacon or something then please yes, eat your hat. Hat good.
---
As safely and effortlessly?
---
Soundtrack is shit.
---
Obivously CCP devs need to create new content (new ship, maybe new arc with reward ? or add some new pvp mechanics, maybe new career option, boss pve with reward for new players and vet, etc) or anything to keep Eve fresh and potentially attarct new players or vet to come back. Just my two cent.
---
I'm sure that's a small part of it, but its impossible to ignore the general stagnation and huge amount of content creators leaving the game.
---
Also, even if it were just people downsizing alts, its still far less subs for CCP.
---
ISK doubling in Jita
---
If you can get 18 bill in donations in 2 hours, I'd be super impressed.
---
Yes very much so. Like a 1% ROI per month is terrible...
---
Lies, horde tried to kill gotg, but goons protected them.
---
Gotg are goon pets
---
And winter co built up to the level it’s at cause of a deal they made with test for no invasion for months
---
I'm glad your back. Internet spaceships are always fun.(◕‿◕✿)
---
Not on ultra safe investments that take 10 minutes per month.
---
But you have time to grind for Billions upon Billions of ISK instead?
---
Holy shit - please manually fly against the Zealot ffs. You could have cut him off easily at least 3 times.
---
:) I stand by my statement lol.
---
I did say they were stupid.
---
Umm... yes, you do. I am not saying they should be let off. Merely saying that, when attempting to explain these people's behaviors, you need to account for it in the explanation.
---
Fair enough. I asked, because I agree that it'd be an interesting topic.  
---
Funny thing is, I think we're local to each other. I live in Loudoun County. And after a bit of poking around from the initial thread about the ban hammer, that sounds close to home.
---
Maybe in defense.
---
But in propulsion without any inertia mods it warps in 1.97 seconds
---
[removed]
---
That last fight was ballin!
---
His name is Robert Paulson
---
Haha alright, I’ll give it a shot.
---
Give them ECM and give caldari something that isn't a party gag gift.
---
You must be new to Eve.
---
You can instawarp in prop mode then switch to tank mode with a non-trivial amount of tank. But I still wouldn't wanna risk it. Hauling BPOs in highsec is a losing game
---
wonder if chinese NC will actually undock, lmao.
---
Fair enough, I haven't played in a long time, so things could be different now, and while yea, I would've have touched an investment like that with a ten foot pole, I also realize that at a certain point making 150 million isk per minute at a near 0 risk is good enough.
---

---
Damn. Mittens might be able to afford about 5 minutes more uptime for INN website
---
Sorry for the confusion Paco!

---
Remember when /r/eve rushed to defend screencaps just like this from delve because they were obviously just hyper-APM players? Yeah wonder what's different
---
It would be cool to see tbh.
---
I don't want it to happen but if it did it would have some appeal
---
Probably not enough though.
---
Send discord req
---
I heard TEST was gay.
---
Please confirm.
---
If your investment doesn't double in value over like 9 months it's a bad investment in eve.

Yep, they've proven time and time again that they only really care about the rules if it hurts their bottom line.  Sure, they'll ban a few bots here and there every year or so to appease the window lickers, but not nearly enough to matter.
---
Hi, could you please come over and fuck my server, she says Im not autistic enough to do it.
---
Also, how do you know they're botting?
---
Oh ok great thanks for clearing that up for me.

I heard FW was dead. Used to play for calmil back in the day, is it really as dead as people are saying?

No that's goons. But they're easy to mistake for each other.

"but guysy just because they were a botting megacoalition on Serenity doesn't mean they'll do the same on TQ!  People change, honest!!111one!1!!"
---
not just gay, but also pwnd
---
A cursory look at their KB debunks this in about 3 seconds.
---
Instawarp jackdaw. you'd need to drop like 10b fit+implants, but it's super-safe, warps in 0.9 in prop and gets 120k ehp in def. while smartbombing a 120k ship in hs is possible, i would not consider it even remotely probable.
---
The Delve version of this are Rorqs.

None of the above!

Just fucking quit. Save yourself

Multi-dollar media empires do not pay for themselves
---
I just log my campers on right after DownTime. Make sure they are in the fleet they need to be in and make sure they are cloaked in an area with lots on Dscan. If I get bored I will take screenshots of the locals and mail it to them...usually while they are in a site. I'll wave in local on the odd occasion...even drop a Jet can with a love note on their undock. Insomnia is a bitch but I can use it to my advantage.
---
I am currently accepting Titans and faction supers
---
Normally I'd discourage this kind of behavior but god damn this week has been a spicy dumpster fire and if we aren't out of wood and gasoline yet then I'm sure as hell not going to try to stop it.
---
Holy shit I forgot about the Erotica1 nonsense. If it’s any consolation, I was a fly on the wall in CODE and NODD when it happened and got absolutely destroyed any time I tried to put the subject to rest.
---
I'd probably try to find a way to make more IRL money, instead of making more video game money...
---
Waiting for the next big war when TEST outnumbers "ALL OF EVE!" 2-1
---
so glad the the chinese are on their own server
---
Is this a GSM leak disguised as a joke?
---
It's not a set twenty minutes. They have arrived for me as fast as 13 minutes but its usually more around 16.
---
nope. One toon since 2008.
---
Don't worry they will be allied to TEST so all botting will be unfounded speculation spread by bad people.
---
GotG turning into the village dog
---
Awesome! Glad you can make it!
---
and he doubles down
---
Exactly what that other guy said. So I'll kill them using a logoff trap and a huggin.
---
Historic oversupply.
---
Garde II comes to mind, there's still more than a quarter million units in circulation that i'm aware of from the old carrier days.
---
I mean, we had a 5 hour battle to clear hostile cyno jammers off a constellation in preparation for an Ihub timer in a keepstar system. With everyone from WinterCo, Panfam, goons, and Tapi showing up. If that’s not an indication that some serious shit is about to go down sooner rather than later, I don’t know what is. 
---
But no, because wars don’t start out with the massive Titan fights it must mean that nothing at all is happening, such a shame.
---
Yeah no one wants em.
---
Hell horde might ally with goons if the objective was to kill gotg
---
They weren't, he just made that name.
---
Would someone who has access to delve moneymaking really care about losing their assets on a dying server?
---
tapi creating an even larger blue donut. color me surprised
---
I doubt it, we attacked GotG specifically because they made deals with goons. In the end I don’t think Horde and GotG will work together again, but Horde at least isn’t going to batphone goons for anything.
---
Yeah I knew a guy who multiboxed 12 Hulks with offgrid Rorqual boosts before the changes. I'm pretty sure he was on cocaine though.
---
The Chinese allied with test are all good Chinese and never bot, the one in wc are all evil and bot 7x24 though
---
Haven't played since... A few years. I dont even know.
---
I had a +55M SP account. I mostly lived solo in WH space. Jumped from hole to hole as I saw fit, did some relic sites when available. Did some PvP when I got the chance.
---
My question: is this still fun and rewarding? Is there anything new to it that makes it more (or less) fun and rewarding?
---
Awww scottie I love that guy. Sorry I missed it homies
---
You don't Eve at work? Loser!
---
(Don't worry I'm a loser too, that's why I play internet space ship games)
---
That man has earned my undying respect with how good he is at pvp. I know saying someone is elite is kind of a meme at this point, but he absolutely deserves the title.
---
now, the key thing is to point out how often and how much.
---
All depends how many risks you take
---
So what you're really saying is that me 'n my bois need to smugpost our way into another war?
---
Challenge accepted.
---
I'd say it's more of a continuation of the last big war, but yeah, I'm with you on that point.
---
ccp appreciates your donation to their next side project  
---
friendly reminder to buy more skins and skill injectors (◕‿◕✿)
---
Haha I cant play it at work...even tho i have a work laptop literally any software installed is strictly monitored due to the nature of my job
---
is that the rose gold galaxy watch? It looks pretty good in this picture. Kinda looked too pink in the store when i first saw it.
---
There's of course the third option that those who reported him were right, and that there was simply a lack of available evidence to uphold the ban. We will never know the truth.
---
Username checks out.
---
An identical structure appeared in the same system, even on the same grid as the one that was destroyed. Semantics about actual revival if you feel like it, that objective was achieved while you were running with your tail between your legs, no question there.
---
I've got a charge3 and it does everything I want it to, other than maybe media control buttons.
---
(member when those were on the side of phones? I member.)
---
&gt; Damage caps are the only way to prevent larger groups from just cynoing in a hundread titans and erasing things from existance in a single volley.
---
its also how you GET hundreds of titans and other caps to show up for others to counter drop. and thus cull the number of them in game.
---
instead, right now you have the "larger groups" murdering citadels anyway, just with subcaps cause idiotic damage caps suck for capital use.  and capital numbers skyrocketing as they not really being used used much for structure bashing,  and are mostly just ratting/dread bomb now.
---
damage cap might have a point in high security systems.  but as it is now.  its nothing more than an artificial "take longer to kill" timer,  which makes them so easy to replace and spam.  that the effort of killing them is more work than making them.
---
EVE used to have a system of industrialists build stuff with tons of defenses, until a combat alliance came to tear it down.   thus keeping the minerals somewhat controlled.
---
but right now,  nothing is being torn down,  evicting would be the definition of impossible without the corp leaving on their own accord(demoralizing, spy sabotage, etc).
---
Ya its rose gold. Very much prettier in person...and despite it being the smaller watch size I was still shocked by the size
---
There's obviously a story here that you're dying to tell, given that you've responded to almost all of the comment chains in this post. I've got nothing interesting going on right now, do tell.
---
no need to be rude about it. he's wanting excitement but as others have said, there is no point to taking space right now. there is a large build up going on, but it's not because war is coming.
---
That corporation name... Touche. Sorry for your loss.
---
I was really hoping they would try to carve out their own sov and generate fresh content. Just more fodder to the blue donut I guess.
---
I'm Brian of Nazareth and so's my wife.
---
To save some confusion we should call them NChi
---
&gt; And Omist is fine botting country.

TEST has nothing to do with ~~Omist~~ KWG.

Says the rust bucket Loki flying slave. 
---
I'll be over here in Dodixie with my coke and hookers. I'll leave you space bigots and scummy revolutionaries to it.
---
But you guys get rent isk from them? Hence why you guys are so quick to defend their SOV...or would TEST let Omist burn...since they have nothing to do with KWG?
---
I'll upvote this. Why not.

I'm playing as an alpha clone, and I'll likely subscribe as an omega once I start hitting the limits. I never would have tried Eve if it wasn't for a free to play option to introduce me to the game. I'm just one data point, but there would be many more people like me out there.
---
What resources are alpha clones "sucking up"? Are other players in the Eve universe - even if they're only cannon fodder - not a useful contribution? Would a game with a higher barrier of entry, and slowly dwindling population, really be more fun?
---
I do just because it's a massive time synch to commit to hours of grinding/ multiboxing mining rigs or sp farms to get enough for the ships I want to fly (and invariable lose eventually).
---
We thought we had a heterosexual in Brand Newbros for a while but it turned out he was just really closeted.

Lol irony, we've been running around with bruthabob literally watching us reinforce structure after structure with no response.

i remember upgrading my mining ship to an osprey.

Had a great run in with Eve Uni who decided to do a frigate roam right through our gatecamp assuming the single cruiser there was all that was camping. 
---
I'll give it to them, they totally committed to the flight and warped out pretty well the minute they were in pods.  Solid discipline and great of them to commit the way they do. If you're new, I'd recommend them just because of how much fun they seem to have.

Whatchuuu say about my stupid?????

Wait you're not a renter and are in a small startup alliance? Nice.

even if CCP changed the existing ones so they had one million runs on them. (instead of infinite) 
---
people who currently own them wouldn't be hosed with an immediate loss of wealth and future buyers would be able to purchase knowing how many of the million runs were remaining and so value them appropriately.
---
Depending on where you're based, head to Orvolle as a base system. It's right on the doorstep of sov null and FW lowsec. I'm biased, but I'd argue one of the best spots for content and it's a high sec system.

---
It can stack up pretty well though. I've seen plenty of active rep armor tanks that are almost impossible to break (short of neuting). Also, buffer tanks for armor can be almost broken in how strong they can get. 
---
I'll admit that active shield tanks are a bitch and the repping is definitely better than the armor delay, but a shield tank is fucked against a good neut fit.
---
The thing is you can make more with that 150b investment on almost anything with fuck all effort. You can do Reactions, Plex flipping, injector flipping, salvage flipping and many MANY mor things that don't take long to do and give 30%+ yield over a 12 month period with hardly any effort besides checking markets every few days and watching patch notes

I don't really care if it was in the past. He doesn't get to tell me or anyone how to play anything or operate in any MMO in a fair and equitable way. He forfeit that a long time ago, but that doesn't stop him from waxing self-righteous about it if you really listen to him talk about it. Sorry kid, but it is not OK with me that he bought and sold gold, characters, items and bots, a really sleazy business on any level and a slap in the face to people who actually work and farm fairly for their play. So it was OK for people to buy and sell UO items was it? Or to sell gold and items and characters in WoW... OK by who? Him? His sleazeball clients? Must be nice to have his super slick legit internet business funded by people cheating at video games. I bet you'd suck him off for a cheeseburger.

Its likely no one actually produces with T2 BPOs at a loss, but the BPOs still exist.  T2 BPOs that produce at a loss would also be substantially less valuable, existing mostly as a status symbol.

Good afternoon my friend,
---
While I normally would be more than happy under normal circumstances to join you with torches and pitchforks, I have to say that we should all take a page from the man, the myth, the CSM 15 candidate himself Brisc Rubal. 
---
Brisc, like the good Protestant Saint before him, Mr Rodgers, has sought to forgive vs perpetually hate.  Shines and Pando have joined him in this universal call for “moving onward” vs “burn them all to the ground”.  Several of us have opted in choosing this attitude onward, and its quite freeing. 
---
You should ask yourself; who do you want to be like. The people who tried to Nancy Kerrigan INIT, or the New Eden Saints  Three,  who responded to their unjust persecution with a grace not seen in EVE, ever. 
---
Be more like Brisc, Pando and Shines. You’ll not only be a better person for it, but you’ll likely be better at EVE as well.

KWG leader already said TEST was one of their surrounding neighbor they pay to keep their silence...
---
me too with my linux I lag more with my ram
---
I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
---
Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called "Linux", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.
---
There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called "Linux" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.
---
These are the highs we should all aspire too.
---
We need you back. The 2003 EVE compare to today’s EVE might as well be a different game.

---
Our corp is built on that very play style. Having the backup of a corp help when you find targets difficult to kill solo, but it is still very enjoyable. If you want to make it more rewarding you can always try hunting with something unusual or different. Try hunting with a heron or nestor for example. It will make old situations new again.

Oh cool. Worthless Pieces of Shit, and some guys from Snuff, have completely removed some randoms from Eve. Thank you for alerting us, Mr President.

There's good people on both sides.
---
You don't buy this to break-even, you buy it as an investment asset that you accelerate your T2 production from, and eventually sell it off to recoup the costs. With ISK inflation it's probably a decent investment if you can afford it. Granted, you then need to find someone to buy it.
---
Will do !
---
I think you can still copy T2 BPOs, and since they are usually perfectly researched, they produce fairly valuable BPCs. It might be worth more to sell the BPCs than to actually produce the item.
---
I'm not downvoting because of your idea, but your grammar and the write up in general.

 Make it a resist reducing module 1 per ship with script to switch for resist you want to reduce

all good point but you're lacking the most important one: what are they supposed to fight over in a time where any nullsec system is almost as good as the next one and can sustain tons of people?
---
So why was he rejected?  Asking out of morbid curiosity since a dead parrot could get into those corps.
---
I was thinking that one stat that isn't (as far as I know) touched is rate of fire/reload times. With a spool up, it could easily start very weak, and climb to a significant reduction in how often the targeted ship's weapons can fire and reload. Certain weapon systems, like lasers, would be less affected, but that's not too different from how other ewar systems work.
---
Thematically, I would imagine this being essentially the Triglavian ship projecting a singularity at the other ship, using time dilation through gravity to slow down the weapon systems of a targeted ship.

Honestly, a new player who jumps around between several corps is way less likely to be a spy than one that simply joins a specific Corp and settles in perfectly.

Haha yeah if you don't melt it in the first volley or have friends around you're kinda fucked. HAMs on a cloak fit are another option.

Is there so time is a deterrent as well. Otherwise I show up with my (many friends) and we reinforce a structure per 5 minutes. So if you have let's say 10 structures in a system you call home, it will take me less than 1h to completely fck your entire infrastructure. With a nice TZ and so on you may not even know it happens by the time I'm gone so hardly any way to prevent it. 
---
Now imagine the same thing with the next timers and you may even get in situations where fleets can volley structures by the time the defense fleet gets to warp to it.... 
---
Also for the people complaining about asset safety, if you want to encourage people to live in that space you need to give them a way to have their assets protected (at least for long enough for them to react) otherwise they won't commit like they do now (where most people have tens of billions of assets in multiple structures in null, which allow them to actually use those assets).

You could also try nullsec gas mining... you need a max tanked venture there because the gas clouds do area of effect damage when you harvest them. Stagger your harvest cycles so the explosions don't happen at the same time. There are like 8 constellations in Eve where you do that. Problem is how to get there alive :D

Interesting. INIT do run smart bombs as well - they run a mix of SB and RR Ravens and balance it carefully so they don't kill their own destroyers, but do eliminate any frigates that are around. And they run a couple of Nestors for extra logi in big fleets (as well as the overprop exeqs having their own reps).
---
One per coalition and add coalitions in the game, more of a trophy then actual use I think
---
@baboon
---
You can fly logi and have to manage reps, or you can fly a sabre/scout and have to actually think about what you're doing. There isn't really any other role with any agency in a big fleet. You may fly a Huginn or a Lachesis or a link ship, but the first two are really just F1 ships with ewar modules instead of guns, and the latter doesn't even get to activate any modules besides the whore gun lol. And that's 99% of the makeup or 99% of nullsec fleets. 
---
At least most ships in the Raven doctrine have a remote rep to manage, and the smaller ships have to worry about defanging sometimes.
---
There are no resources they need that isnt already available to them

Not only that but the cyno jammer mechanics change has made even roaming a fleet in enemy space impossible as you have to slowboat meaning you are restricted to sub-caps but the defender can hot-drop supers wherever they want.

Then add in citadels which mean that it's completely pointless even attempting to take space even if you wanted to and it makes a stale environment where economic warfare is more profitable.

Actually lore-wise it'd be better if caldari have anti-drone module as their secondary ewar system, and then trigs could get something more interesting (something related to space-time).

It's like we've gone back to POS sov but the POSes are nigh-on indestructable, you then also have to grind out other completely pointless structures, do a faction warfare mini-game and then mine and rat as much as you can before you can claim the space as your own.

Harypy's (Caldari assault frigate) are all the rage atm for fleet. Retributions are a good about also (Amarr). Otherwise I'd say Enyo or Ishkur (Gallente) for microgangs. Assault frigates/cruisers have access to a special DCU these days, which gives them massive resists for a 15 second burst so you'll definitely want to use these.

I don't want to see nullsec dead. People still die regardless of intel channels. Ever been to Delve? Having plenty of people in space with local as is always beats having no local and barely anyone out doing stuff in anything else than something cloaky, nullified and/or instawarping.

The victim complex again. TEST drops caps and supers on anything that moves in Esoteria. Single cruisers, frigate gangs, anything.

You can't keep complaining about getting supers dropped on you repeatedly while your own group has been doing the same thing to people for the past two or so years.

TEST aren't the "good guys". We use all the tactics that are considered "shitty" by most people. We make use of large scale cloaky camping during campaigns. We won our last war in the south in large part by denying content repeatedly. We use supers as an i-win button in Eso.

/r/eve is literally 70% goons, what do you expect
---
Yes, I've been in BRAVE from 2012-2015, so I've been there for literally the entire first catch era. Afterwards I joined TEST, so I've been around there, too.
---
But that doesn't change the fact that people like you *still* claim to be the victim when both the game itself and the alliance are completely different. And you point fingers at groups like PL, while we do the same shit to other groups.
---
what if i told you there were loads of ways to make buttloads more isk with no taxes than boring yourself to death in delve grinding.
---
calm down
---
Lmao get over it idiot.
---
Ptsd in the wild.
---
Hey i'm not picking on you for going to gym- good on ya', but to blame a single game, I feel is a bit of a stretch.
---
Then go and start a world war.
---
Contrary to your pubbie belief, nullsec people do not accumulate ships, train skills and do things to be your personal entertainment while you watch it docked in a 0.6 saying your RL friends you are involved in something.
---
Gaming is the hobby I enjoy doing, that's replaced watching TV a long, long time ago. Work, social, fitness, housework, family come first- When all those things are done for the day, I'll sit down and login. (often leave myself logged in throughout a free day)
---
At least you could reinforce POS's in 1 siege cycle.
---
”January 2018” I think
---
I’m not implying we’re victims, we are where we are because of our past. Its people like you who bitch about the present that piss me off. You’re forgetting where we come from and why we’re here
---
Get a girlfriend
---
TAPI clearly needs more blues
---
I just let my sub expire, easy style. I will be coming back though.
---
Now this is dinoposting
---
*witty comment*
---
Where am I bitching about the present though? 
---
If I didn't like current day TEST I would fuck off to a different alliance.
---
I just get triggered by the people like you who constantly repeat the "grr PL dropped supers on us 5 years ago and that's why they're evil and we do X" meme.
---
How did you go with that?
---
I can testify whether a screenshot is fake or not, I have seen plenty in my time and this one wasn't posted
---
Soundtrack is the shit!
---
Last time I checked pgl was an FC and not a diplomat.
---
X4 is out, and summer is around the corner.
---
"join our alliance or we'll steal your stuff" sounds like a great way to take in lots of spies
---
"we had to become goon pets because we suck"
---
TEST is one of the controlling party’s of KWG, they don’t say it officially because they want to appear ‘anti-botter’ but TEST recently had control of the faction forts in omits and transferred them back to KWG shortly before this campaign ;)

No, you fit a cloak in a high slot as normal. But you can't use cloak as omega, indeed.
---
Be the change you want to see, go out and YOLO with a BS/BC solo, or grab a corp-mate in a AF or hull tanked cruiser as tackelbait.

I'm still loving the game. Especially when people like you leave it. Feels good. Thanks for that.
---
Good point lol

I think it's more like, Get a life.
---
Great action.
---
Don't they blend right into planets with the camo?
---
I don't know how people ever find them to gank.
---
This is how my buffer armor stratios looks like after every harder engagement. :)
---
Almost too much freedom for the ‘other person’
---
I for one thank him for his contribution to my wallet
---
Ask not what your country can do for you...
---
Oh a freighter. For a second there, I thought vysh had a reallllly bad night.
---
&gt; heron
---
Which will also hurt much less when loosing other than a +900m Stratios
---
this is why you don't believe propaganda.
---
The reason we are not having any serious fighting is that there is nothing to gain from evicting your enemy. 
---
Also this solution would be retarded in the first place. Goons+Legacy are over half of EVE, PANFAM+Winter is 25% of eve, its not even nearly a close fight.
---
Bwahahahahaha
---
he's not bitching about the present, he's bitching about victim-wannabes like you who act as if the whole of test is suffering from actual ptsd.
---
you guys drop supers on everything you can get away with, you're the second largest group in the game allied to the largest group in the game, so stop whining like you're a fucking holocaust survivor
---
Yep, steam is a great platform to reach new people. Having an image like this doesn't inspire really
---
I never found a corp that was fitting me personally. I've been in a a very big corp (Brave Newbies I guess) and a medium corp. Never felt anywhere near home there. Also never saw how a corp could improve my game but that is probably exactly why I keep this on-off relationship with this game.
---
I mean yeah I could keep trying new corps until this game starts to be fun but who has the energy for that?
---
when you're part of a mega coalition with nearly 100k members, and your only relevant enemy are around 25k members, its time to stop with the victim complex.
---
&gt; similar culture
---
Oh.
---
the north never were the largest blue donut ever though.
---
You're asking people viewing a video game subreddit about moving on...
---
&gt;Cooking is more of a hobby
---
Oh my mistake. I thought it was a basic human activity that allows said humans to feed themselves i.e. preparing food for consumption. If you cant feed yourself you are functionally retarded.
---
I need your tears so yes come back plz sir.
---
It's like a 5 year old, all covered in peanut butter. And when his mothers asks "did you eat the peanut butter" thinks for a few seconds and then goes "... no...".
---
drip drip drip
---
It's a fucking game dude, like shit, not having fun? Don't play it.
---
this isnt confirmed
---
i made a new friend this evening when a stratios came to visit me while i was running a ded site. even though he wasn't able to kill me, i appreciate that he had the gall to give it a shot, and that he stuck around to the end. it was a genuinely good fight and it gave me the shakes.
---
Child may not be lying. The pause was him trying to think if any peanut butter made it into his mouth.
---
the only thing that can defeat freedom is muninns and bosons
---
Same pretty much. Adulting comes first. Fishing also comes first. Then other things like video games and comics.
---
they removed the fire effect like ... 4 years ago :(

Eww, gross

I bet he kisses girls

It's something like 20 per mod and 40 per ammo.

Dude. Carrier: 900Mil - 1B for the hull.

Supers: 12,5-14B for the hull.
---
Wormhole players are so far from the civilization? Lol
---
i liked it, thanks
---
the thing is TAPI hasnt had's it day, when it can if it wants to. It's aspiring to be 'also ran'.
---
Why would removing this be good? You need to argue that rather than sweeping the side effects of your proposals under the rug.
---
Is INN and TheMetaShow this low on viewership interest that you need to come here and bait?!
---
Sorry I didn’t get you bro, what do you mean?
---
why?
---
Have you tried not being bad at the game
---
Freedom to endlessly bash refineries at the end of nowhere!
---
Restaurants exist and cook far better food than I can at home with the added bonus of no washing up after.
---
yacht works fine, less than 2 sec align and cloak/decloak every warp

Contact note should contain "need isk, have kids!"
---
Cloaky camping is the only counter to local/intel channels that spread entire regions. And when you factor in the intel bots that instantly report people in a channel and that near2 bullshit. It’s almost the only way to catch people ratting and mining. 
---
It’s not such a great problem for people that use wormholes, we have our own ways of hunting but for large nullsec groups that can’t do that then it’s the only way to drop
---
Agree - spineless cowards without a hint of self-respect.
---
thats assuming you sell it for what you bought it for.  ISK depreciates where the BPO will most likely appreciate.
---
fuck off globby

Great!

Combat Wombat really shit? More news at 11.

stop

thinking you have your own brain

found a new corp after a long break. nice people to chat with.
---
Okay, now where is my game dat cheese steak combo deal?
---
The kind of people who can of their own initiative find their way out of hisec aren't the kind of people who ask "just started what do?" Curiously they find their own direction of their own initiative.
---
yes sure love me some mass reciprocal ejaculation contest between titan blob #1 and titan blob #2, what better way to pass the time
---
We all know it was Mittens who reported Brisc, so why extra show for that?!
---
meeses
---
Have you tried not posting egotistical bullshit?
---
Whats wrong with january 2018?
---
Sorry, is avoiding the faction police difficult in the slightest if you have a semi-functioning brain?
---
I read this as "Latest aids on steam" for some reason
---
Cause Dotlan numbers mean anything.
---
"Hacked". Right. Elite hackers (Think Angelina Jolie in the movie "Hackers') penetrate CCPs infrastructure just to get this dude's account.
---
Probably shared the accountname with his character's and used a retarded password, more like.
---
No one would even notice if simple farmers folded.
---
Hammertime!
---
&gt;now that it's becoming less and less fun to play
---
It's not tho? And with the war with frat its becoming more fun for me at least.
---
&gt;I also occasionally post on this reddit and catch up on the news of how EvE is devolving further, never wishing to come back...
---
About a decade ago, I had a pretty blingy officer fit* Navy Mega that got down to hull, before a triage carrier repped me up and saved my ass.  The fire trail that followed me around as we returned home, to me, looked pretty damn awesome, so I decided to leave it there.
---
From then on, if I needed to repair modules, I'd strip them off the Megathron and repair them indivdually.
---
If I'd taken armour damage that needed fixing, I'd fit a couple of LARs, undock, and use them on the undock.
---
For the next year, I never repaired the ship in station.  That trail of fire would follow my ship on every roam and fight until the Navy Mega was shelved and I switched it to a Proteus.
---
^* ^OK ^... ^it ^was ^a ^single ^officer ^sensor ^booster ^...
---
Ravens die often enough. Here a zkill related when we used it the first time (afaik) after rage. The stuff isn't properly sorted and so on. Do that stuff yourself

---
&gt;I've lost a bunch of weight and started going to the gym several times a week, learned cooking and am enjoying life

i managed to do this without having to give up eve.
---
CCP need to address citadels, sov mechanics and system cyno jammers as well as provide a reason for groups to fight over space before we'll see anything more than content deployments.
---
Why
---
&gt; without producing anything
---
More players = more content, it's simple as that. Not to mention that many alphas  will likely spend some money on this game at some point, whether it's omega time or other serices.
---
Why does Dodixie make it cheaper?
---
You know how easy it is to move?
---
/u/Annahsbananas
---
Welcome o7
---
Give Her the send off She deserves mate, Big Loves &lt;3
---
Daily alpha skill injectors are specifically designed to bridge that SP gap so no, the 20mil SP hard cap is definitely not for returning vets only.
---
My condolences.
---
Fight! Eagles Fight!
---
https://zkillboard.com/alliance/448511760/
---
Fair point.
---
😂
---
Metagame?
---
&gt; I'm playing as an alpha clone, and I'll likely subscribe as an omega once I start hitting the limits. 
---
If the limits keep being raised, then you won't need to.
---
When we're all alphas, none of us will be alphas (and the hamsters will be dead).
---
I think alphas should be cruiser down.If you get into cruisers and still don't like it enough to put money in, then you probably never will.
---
we are retards that play eve, no for real tho, just some funny ass people that have too much time on our hands in eve and decided to have fun doing just about everything eve has to offer and creating our own content whenever possible.
---
&gt; More players = more content
---
No payers = no content.
---
Score a touchdown 1,2... 1-2-3!
---
yeah, they do. 
---
What numbers do you want then? Imperium alone outnumbers the north in supers, even if with GOTG on the northern side.
---
Do you not have a phone?
---
Limits on alphas are unfair and game breaking. Why shouldn't I be able to fly every T-1 ship in the game. It's not like I'm asking for T2 or T3! It's fucking ridiculous to make it so I can't provide content. Fucking goons!
---
You have bigger problems than you know.
---
You guys have drones right?
---
Why, tho? In the past, R64 moons were a great motivator to conquer shit. Or the BoB vs Goon thing, which was more a matter of principles. And before that, shit-talking northerners needing to be put into their place.
---
But now? The wealth is spread out across the map. You don't need region &lt;whatever&gt; to make money, you can do it in the shittiest null-system anywhere.
---
Then there's the mess that coalitions and "safety in numbers" think introduces, which is just no fun.
---
Stop
---
no
---
I stand corrected
---
I think we still have some tires to throw on it.
---
23.5
---
&gt;* OK ... it was a single officer sensor booster ...
---
Look at you, all rich and stuff.
---
stop thinking
---
just watch the frog
---
LAWN or Init. could be your way to go if you want to be in the same neighorhood as Goon.
---
Nah, because literally I have had conversations with the interceptor pilot that almost tackled me in my ratting rig and we laughed about who would have killed whom. 
---
You can smacktalk and not be an asshole.
---
Maybe you are just not very good at it mate?  Maybe you're in the wrong game and sub if you can't communicate in any language besides egotistical wanker.
---
Well that is a good change indeed.   Thanks for the info!
---
Next there will sex-having, and the horrible cycle continues
---
Playing the game OUTSIDE the constraints of the game.
---
I am not a writer or a "twitch person" at INN.
---
And cooking these days can be _really_ easy. Slow cookers are a wonderful thing. Ditto with stuff like frozen chopped onion (it's a handy staple. Keeps for months, and you can choose how much to use easily. And I'm lazy ;) )
---
Is never to lateto start playing eve..
---
Welcome to Eve Online!
---
Oh cool nvm then
---
You still sound desperate for attention v0v
---
Things are cheaper in the ghetto.
---
You should see his interviews recently hes showed hes coming back to focus on eve
---
&gt; I guess it's easier to just throw around insults though
---
Yes, yes how the tables have turned eh
---
You seem to be mixing up CCP and Eve. It would be like Ford saying China was going to be their biggest market but you wondering why F150 sales are slumping in China. The product they are pushing is not Eve.
---
Is that why we don't know who's running the show or what the roadmap for the game is?
---
oh sev one less reddit poster to stalk
---
:pensive:
---
have fun wherever
---
Because it is a meme that require effort and creativity to use! It's timeless
---
So, what product would ccp be pushing apart from eve ? Their dead mobile game ?
---
Game's dead, move on.
---
On 27/04/2019 at 09:41:36, TAPI became self aware.
---
Maybe, although I'm not sure what interest there will be for that with weekly server population peaks of less than 3000, including bots and alts.
---
But then we'd all missed the quarterly EVICTION threads.
---
Dayum, didn't know things were that bad over there.
---
Pox
---
Talk Shit get kicked...
---
Want to buy a Hunky bro to cook my dinner
---
lmao that gave me a good laugh
---
From what I understand, China's big gaming market is in mobile phones. So I presume the new Eve Mobile app they're creating with a reduced version of the game
---
also not having 2fa in 2019. literally deserve to get hacked
---
but they can't really push for people to join tq as thats not allowed in China, the whole reason for Serenity being a thing is Chinese laws
---
Nothing, unless you have something against using the current date.
---
The fact that we are in 2019 ?
---
It can give the impression that the game wasn't updated since a long time, and so demotivate few candidates. Don't underestimate the ability of people to judge with only few words or one line of text, it is already like that concerning news headlines.
---
This date should be removed.
---
K, CCP Cheerleader
---
Is this an out of season april fools joke?
---
Me 😂
---
Bye, I hope it's nice wherever it is that you're going...
---
Freedom is calling, will you answer?
---
To be fair why would a person "desperate for attention" make a throw away account for the sole purpose of redirecting the attention of everybody to a group of people they have nothing to do with?
---
Last time I was really playing, Conflagration was crap.  I heard it was buffed since then, so was just wondering if there is a reason to use it over multifrequency now? 
---
I'm wondering about:
---
Frig to Frig
---
Cruiser to Frig
---
Cruiser to Cruiser
---
COCKS
---
Well it's not everyday u get the millionth kill for the alliance.
---
See there’s a solution for everything, even if you’re lazy haha. But nothing can’t beat the taste of fresh ingredients.
---
I can’t find HAMs on my drone and they don’t allow me to fly it near the airport... What do?
---
?
---
I used to fly rhiload’s Nighthawk fit before the kinks changes. Was fun for smallgang, but haven’t used it much after the changes since it has no bonus to Skirmish links.
---
Xelp.
---
As all things should be
---
Dunno, it seems to have worked pretty well tbh
---
Wasn't even aimed at you and you're here getting all triggered lol
---
Exactly, which is why alpha players are so vital to the survival of this game.
---
Yes that is what we need   something to fight over.  It Will probably Bring back People to the game as Well
---
Exactly.
---
Just classic so -  many great comments in one meme. And what a summary 😃😎
---
Unfortunately can only give one upvote
---
im gay
---
Hilmar doing the yearly PR talk, nothing to see here move along.
---
**Why I cloaky camp:**
---
Lets start by answering the question. Cloaky campers are cancer. They ruin the game. They are OP etc etc.
---
Here is my answer as a cloaky camper...
---
Cloaky camping is the polar opposite to Local Chat + Intel Bots / networks. Now step back from your crabbing and have a think about how safe you are.
---
You are mining / ratting in a pocket which has an entrance 5 jumps away. You have N2 ([near2](http://www.evedustry.com/near/)) running. Near 2 pings that there is a neutral toon 5 jumps away. All the gates have large bubble fucks. You de siege / de NSA and warp to your safe spot till the hunter is gone.
---
The only risk you have is a wormhole spawning in your system which is VERY VERY rare and also requires a good quick combat scanner to be on the other side.
---
This is nullsec and nullsec should be dangerous. The only way to make your ratting experience risky is to put a cloaky camper in your system.
---
Now if CCP ban Near 2 and programs like it or delay local chat in some way. Then I agree cloaky camping should be nerfed. Until then its the only equaliser to this risk free ratting nullsec has.
---
**Over to the Setup: (105 clients, 3 PC's, Omega accounts, simultaneously online)**
---
I used to run the clients on a server as outlined in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8dx74j/a_story_from_a_cloaky_camper_and_an_attempt_to/) thread. However, I found that I got to a limitation of 80 clients. It broke / crashed a lot. Windows 10 came out with an awesome memory compression feature which made it more cost effective and less hassle to run it on separate PC's. Also if one PC crashes I don't need to log in 105 clients.
---
**Hardware: ( These rigs support approximately 45-50 clients in 1024x768 rez potato graphics / no audio)**

All CPU's have been under clocked because FX-8350's pull a lot of power and these are shit motherboards. You can only reliably run these at full power on the high end  Sabertooth 990fx board.  If you run them at 4Ghz and stock VCORE voltage on these shitty boards they overheat the motherboard MOSFETS (I think that's their name) and it throttles the CPU causing lag spikes.
---
I have thought about fabricating a water cooled heat sink as I have access to milling machines etc but have not got round to it. I want to mount these motherboards in a custom case with a water loop ideally. Just as a nerdy project. Just need the time to get on with it.
---
The game runs at 50+fps no problem paired with ISBOXER.
---
**Software:**
---
[ISBOXER](https://www.lavishsoft.com/account/register?referral=%23fb87-Mar5hy)
---
[ISBOXER Eve Launcher](https://github.com/LavishSoftware/ISBoxerEVELauncher)
---
Windows 10 - Prof
---
[EANM - client setting sync](https://github.com/Bertral/EANM)
---
I have ISBOXER setup in a way where I can load a client on any PC. E.g camper dies. I boot up the client on my  main PC to move it back to system.
---
Each client is assigned a hotkey to bring the window to the front and referenced in my sheet
---
[https://i.imgur.com/y54NA3k.png](https://i.imgur.com/y54NA3k.png)
---
I launch the clients with a batch script using ISBEL. Its a far superior launcher to the eve one. It actually encrypts your account info I believe. [https://i.imgur.com/kpL3IYY.png](https://i.imgur.com/kpL3IYY.png)
---
Once clients are launched here comes the worst bit. Logging them in. I use the hot keys and press enter to log the client in. When the clients are logged in I cycle through them pressing F1 to cloak. You can also setup input broadcasting to **ONLY** log in. Nothing more. No cloaking. However you cannot log in 40 at once or the pc will die. You need to setup broadcasting to groups such as 1-10 11-20 21-30 etc and do batches. This saves a little time but not enough to make it worth any mistakes.
---
U do realise that PIBC are already made advance moves onto Tranquility, right ?
---
They are Army of Mango Alliance. 
---
Go watch  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa31nDBsUJI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa31nDBsUJI)   
---
They do nothing without a purpose and a plan.
---
Army of Mango fought Test in a friendly skirmish the otherday &amp; had 300 dudes/dudettes lined up egar and waiting well in advance, of the appointed time. How many TQ alliances can do that ?
---
if only it would have been a freighter.
---
#bearlivesmatter
---
I was hoping the same. Some changes to sov etc a new enemy to fight
---
Someone please correct me if i am wrong but it seems that things have gone as follows:  
---
Russians: let's form a coalition to evict China..... nothing really happened at all  
---
Test: We'll Join the fight ... Feeds to china 9/10 times, blames line members, FCs get demoralized because line members react poo to their pings  
---
Test (part 2): Starts anchoring structures everywhere but doesn't form to save them and just ends up feeding more and more structures for yet unknown reasons  
---
So in TLDR, Test/Legacy/Russians can't handle some china men that have weak EU timezone and semi weak US timezone despite having all these people so they called on Serenity Chinese to come save them... ?   
---
What happened to "The Russians are going to evict Frat" ..?  
---
Maybe if they coordinated better and actually formed, they would have a better chance...  
---
Skillu and others aren't always there and it has just been Frat and pets that have been owning test in all timezones recently, Skillu seem to of vanished.   
---
Maybe if they banned people rorqual mining again instead of reacting to pings, they would have more PvP in fleet ? What is going on with test right now....?
---
At least you weren't ignored.
---
Clearly whoever hacked him did not robbed him off 120b isk in assets, only used him to drops his sec status, waited a few days for him to log back in, and followed him, cloaked in a cloakie hauler, hoping for him to jump to high sec and loot his wreck, no one the wiser...
---
8D Chess move, people!
---
HACKERS!!!
---
I am aware yes, but I'm more referring to of/when they give up all holdings on Serenity and come here en-masse
---
Why is that last part even necessary? Why make friendly arrangements about times and places to fight at? What even *is* this?
---
no more red shirts ;P
---
Well we should receive the chinese with open arms.  New players on TQ Then it Will get bit more populated again and hopefully null wil see some changes and Will be Fun again instead of People blueing the entire or Eve and now Being static
---
This is literally *being the change you wish to see in the world*
---
Good job 👍🏼
---
See my bio, I was stuck in a time warp from ten years ago.
---
Well i don't see the player numbers going up though despite everything. Only that the chinese are coming over.
---
Yep. Wh strata almost always have neuts.
---
lol that fit
---
You guys smell that? Yup, shitpost, but not the good kind.
---
Ok i will be now 100% serious : **No one cares**         
---
This is a game start treating it like a game!             
---
me ingame != me on reddit != me irl            
---
You are treating those spaceship pixels way to much serious.
---
Don't forget that both side's timezones are literally 12 hours apart, meaning timers will be earlier than 10 am in the morning for either side... On a bloody Wednesday. They quite literally can't attack eachother.
---
Your dedication to out of game reddit says otherwise.
---
Like few thousands Chinese are moving in to TQ.         
---
99% of them will only be able to PLEX the game due to RL limitations.             
---
They will be injecting skills to catch up -&gt; this cost extractors and time on skill farms -&gt; and this directly translate to PLEX.          
---
None of them will start just one account - even more increasing the plex price.
---
I might have missed it in the wall of text, but how do you afford to sub 105 accounts?
---
Good skills and a +3% to dmg and +3% to ROF and void

They need to build themselves up quite a bit before they can do any carving.

Shhh
---
this is cute and hole lot of bs
---
No this was people just speculating - without any real reson to back up this speculation.           
---
Now people are speculating moving price higher knowing that in upcoming 6 months people will pay increased prices as skill injectors they will produce will be instantly bought (almost) no matter the price.

Given the cancer of sov warfare and citadel mechanics, nothing big is going to change anytime soon.

Can you elaborate on the abyssal PVP please? I’m familiar with the concept of abyssal space and it’s pve dimension, but not quite the pvp one!

Seriously. Worthless, self-important, moron

We’ve asked him this a few times. It’s apparently mostly skill farming and being paid to cloaky camp systems

"Neither Brisc Rubal nor the other players implicated in this incident breached CCP’s confidentiality, the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement, or used privileged information to obtain an in-game advantage."
---
I'm just going to keep reposting that until it sinks in to the people whose brains appear coated in a thick candy shell.
---
wouldnt be a first
---
Hmmm...I can actually believe the "being paid to cloaky camp systems" part. Makes sense with the following of bombers bar and crap that he/she has.
---
Either works
---
we are all pwnrs of one another on this blessed gay
---
Billion kills? Doubt that.
---
I think he meant that the first rise was due to generic 'I don't have anywhere else to put my ISK so I'll put it into PLEX' speculating whilst now there is a market reason to speculate beyond it being the equivalent of gold IRL.
---
Can someone give me a rundown on using the Golem for mission running? I finally got one and I'm super stoked to fly it.

Yeah I mean that assumption is dumb, the second part makes sense but the trend has always been upward starting from far before the Chinese move.

God damn I love that ship.

actually, it would be much closer to a 1vs1, though it's hard to estimate the value of each sides account numbers. I know that legacy and imperium have a lot of miners in their ranks too, but I could only estimate how many krab-accounts Panfam and others have
---
I too fly a Stratos. I love them

Which I don't think was denied, just that it's going to go even faster now.

Doesn't every armour tank look like this after taking one hit when the shield is gone?
---
it's hard, but not impossible.
---
It's impossible to evict someone, if they got endless cash and will. But war in eve was always about fighting the will of the opponent. And you can make your enemy incapable of living his life, even with citadels. 
---
And you state: Empire, and an Empire requires industry, harvesting, economy. All these you can remove. The only thing that you cannot effectively destroy is their ability to have a home, no matter how small

I am out of eve, what happened? I found only [the interim statement from CCP](https://www.eveonline.com/article/pq436e/interim-statement-on-brisc-rubal-follow-up-investigation) and [final statement](https://www.eveonline.com/article/pqiubr/final-statement-on-brisc-rubal-follow-up-investigation). But not what happened before.
---
They had a press release saying brisc was removed from the CSM and banned with 2 others for breaking the NDA.
---
Neat update.
---
All forgotten and unsecured sites are guarded by sleepers. If you stay in C1-C2 WH you can also find pirate sites that are unguarded. Sleeper relic/data sites are also 1 wh class higher in difficulty than the hole you are in, so a sleeper site in a c2 is at c3 difficulty, etc.
---
You can't play manuevering games with the sleepers, they can point and shoot you from insane ranges, way more than what our ships can do.
---
Get pyfa for your fits and google the sites. Compare dps and tank/neut numbers.
---
Nice screenshot

FYI: /r/eveporn is also a nice subreddit for some artistic eve-related screenshots/pictures

I am curious, when the 64 bit client is released and eve moves towards using DX12, what impact if any, will that have as far as the hardware being used is concerned to run that mainy clients?

Make Nullsec Dangerous Again
---
For me you are a hero. Wish you could camp whole nullsec.
---
how quickly did you go (realize ?) from 2 accounts to 105?
---
Technically we always had asset safety, because stations were indestructible.
---
Players who actually play/played on Serenity will know better, but last time I checked the Netease EvE forums (with the help of Google translate), it seemed that the new Serenity is still not officially up. They're doing some kind of really long semi-open testing, with the last DB dump of the old Serenity (from 9/2018 or sth), but they intend/intended to wipe everything done during this 'test', and then do an official Serenity deployment.
---
I assume that's why PIBC decided to move to TQ.
---
The camper cost is subsidised by skill extraction.   
---
I have +4s in each camper. I front the isk for 3 or more months. Train leadership skills and then extract when I pull them in after contracts. Extract and Sell the injectors.   
---
I also charge 1B per system per month so earn 105B / month from contracts.  
---
I have also extorted some constellations and earn approx 5B from that per month.
---
&gt; a group of people they have nothing to do with?
---
wow, u really believe that?!
---
Wait, so the effect doesn't go away if you just don't rep in station? TIL.
---
Nicely done
---
Now *this* is autism
---
Nice work man, nice work.
---
As God intended...
---
I enjoy cloaky campers.... They fuck with bots/afk'ers but anyone who pays attention and isn't total shit at Eve is basically unaffected.  
---
Will I lose a ship or two?   Sure.    But nowhere near the isk loss I would suffer if I was afraid to undock because a lone neutral is camping my system.  
---
Solution to cloaky camping... basically ignore them.
---
I remember finding all sorts of things empty and steal-able, battleships,barges, you name it. but didn't have the skills at the time and the people I knew in game tended to be some lazy fucks who didn't want to fly far for free loot. 
---
I was the far traveler of the lot, mostly in small fast cloaky probing stuff, so I could find all sorts of things but couldn't fly them.
---
This was pre-skill injector. Now it's bloody easy (though expensive) to be much more multi-talented.
---
I hated Vexors with a passion before I could fit and fly them right.
---
They lasted 20 minutes from purchase to *poof*. Bob, I hated those motherfuckers.
---
These bans didnt make any sense considering your group's successes. I'm really glad CCP revisited this, would have been a real shame to remove you three from the game.
---
Over a year I guess. I gradually increased the campers. 
---
105 is quite a lot to login every day so kinda set that as my limit.

You get fake internet points being afk in his channel. They arnt used to buy anything but fake in channel chat bot replies.

Try learning before you post some nonsense chad level crap here

Source: I fucking suck and welp regularly
---
literally what I said?
---
Not really. Eve is an Mmorpg that has some very tedious and boring PvE activities, that sometimes only require a player action every 20 minutes or so, thus making it viable to play another game or watch a movie while playing Eve.
---
I doubt it will get that high now that the largest groups are leaving.

It's saying that Herr Hilmar doesn't care about the Chinese market for the desktop game

Not much. About 8p per hour according to my smart meter. I get charged half at night also.

---
came here to say this
---
Wow....i'm still thinking if this is good or bad.
---
The purpose you do it is for anti-botting. Sure, some pvp corps/alliances pay you to get a nice cyno in a system of choice for some pew pew. 
---
But, do you also work for krabbers to keep their ratting space safe? And if so, do you sometimes cyno-in reds to harrass your own customers?
---
Same. Im not too sure tbh.
---
Holding ratting systems to ransom was a good money maker for me. Nice to see someone has taken it and gone full autismo.
---
I use to get lots of chatlogs of people bitching at me in local till they paid up. Do you have a collection OP that you could share?

I work for anyone who pays me. I wont camp the contractor directly and wont accept a contract that camps a current contractors home space. However I will shoot them if caught by other means. Such as BB / volta etc. I pretty much shoot anyone and have very few blues.

a) Item got nerfed and supply is still too high or margin were good enough and too many builders jumped on bulding that item over actual demand. 
---
b) Market sell orders are supplied from buy orders (that are supplied from selling loot) meaning sellers dont need to take input costs into account
---
You think these weeks will stop with train or skill, they won't. Every one wants just one more site whether you are in a new bean ship or boson ratting. Got take the good with the bad, because pulling off " its worth the risk" things in this game is so fun.
---
There is no better rush than to get out of a situation with 5% hull.
---
You have violated the law.

why not? most people like fights so why not schedule a time?
---
I really miss our corp, mostly because of stuff like this. Well written as usual!
---
Its fun cloaky camping. It's fun making the clients work. Getting the pieces in place.   
---
You cannot tell people how to play their sandbox
---
Did you read anything i just wrote or just fell back to "MUH 100k vs 25k"
---
If you look at the numbers from the sources i said, you'll find they're similar.
---
Im thankful for this explanation. Dont let someones opinion of a person taint that persons reputation.
---
Not that I know of. I hate bots so try and farm them as much as possible. I also make videos of blatant botting and send to security@ccp
---
So, do you actually kill stuff from time to time, or is it just psychological warfare ?
---
You're implying that there is somehow more "inactives" in Imperium/Legacy than in PANFAM, thats a retarded claim and not true. 
---
If you actually look at the sources you said (you didn't really say any, it would be like saying google is a source) you will see that Imperium alone outforms PANFAM with several fleets, both subcap and capital. Whats with the constant need to feel like Test is a elite force that always fights outnumbered? Fact is you are the second largest fish in the pond, and the largest is your best friend.
---
Oh Querns :(
---
Cloaky camping is absolute cancer. It has a place in the game, but as is, it is completely broken. You should not be able to sit idle in a system for days at a time without paying attention. 
---
There should be some kind of structure that you can build, that can be pulsed every 6-12 hours that decloaks all ships in system. If a cloaky camper isn’t active playing, they can be combat probed down. 
---
“Null-sec isn’t supposed to be safe,” is not a sound argument for a gameplay mechanic with no countermeasure, in my opinion.
---
Meh. Staged wars for the sake of entertainment are boring, if ccp knew what they were doing and csm wasn't infiltrated by an alliance of omega krabs they would create a system where war is not an option.
---
But there is no gambling on the stuff in the store. The gold these ppl are talking about is not used for anything. He does giveaways just like every other streamer. Its a drawing and if you win you get something. The ignorance of people in this post is astounding.
---
Neuts spotted 15 systems out dock up your bots?

Countless kills. Look at my corp killboard. Kills with Don Trolleone or a manticore in my corp are camper kills.

Dont need to nerf local. Just the features near2 utilizes to actually run which are not found in any other mmo I am aware of.
---
Try using windows
---
Water cooling the processor wont allow you to make it faster in your case since the power mosfet on the boards are the issue. To solve this get a better mobo or go back to a server. Server graphics cards are going for pretty cheap these days as well.
---
Not the processor. I will fabricate a heatsink to sit on the mosfets.
---
Mind going into a little more detail on that? I don't have a programming background (or Eve HR background) so I'm not clear on what feature(s) you're referring to, or how they impact other third party tools and utilities in the game.
---
Keep up the good work
---
Its very hard as it pulls logs form the intel chat channels.
---
How does a idle camper kill you? You need to live in HS my dude.   
---
If that structure nerfs local chat in the whole constellation **YES**
---
Basically if you remove the chat logging to the hard drive then you kill near2 in an instant. Near2 doesn't read the local or Intel channels through OCR or optical character recognition. It reads the chat logs and then parses data for you. Could you do OCR. Sure. But it's a lot harder for a computer to tell as it can be manipulated to look normal for a human but can be difficult for a computer to read. OCR is also much harder to program than simply reading a log and takes a lot more processing power.
---
Juat dunk the whole thing in mineral oil at that point. You are going to be running the mosfets at near there maximum it sounds like even before accounting for the heat.
---
You say "this is nullsec and nullsec should be dangerous" i agree but you apparently have 105 ships sitting 24/7 in nullsec without any risk. You see the contradiction?
---
Well, keep fighting the good fight then.
---
He never said he was hacked, just he would contact support

Try shitposting better. I use a lot of development tools that run better in Linux which is why I use it as my primary OS. I dual-boot Windows as a last resort.
---
I have a Windows VM for Office that I have EVEMon installed on but I would rather find a way to run it through WINE as it's less resource intensive. I'm going to go ahead and assume you either don't know or don't use WINE but thanks anyway
---
No matter what they do then it wont matter. Quit being a pessimist please.
---
&gt;I'd imagine your mother regrets not choosing the abortion every day.
---
Definitely not triggered, gotcha
---
If this is true it is the most boring outcome of what could have happended with pibc joining tq.
---
That is actually not a bad idea.
---
You say you don’t input broadcast, but you’ve been caught talking in local on all your characters simultaneously saying the exact same thing....
---
Sure if you leave it on you can make mistakes. I don't use it to cloak. I don't use it to gain an unfair advantage. Hence I'm not banned. 
---
We all know how quick CCP are to ban people these days. So that should be enough for you to get over it.
---
&gt;You are mining / ratting in a pocket which has an entrance 5 jumps away. You have N2 (near2) running. Near 2 pings that there is a neutral toon 5 jumps away. All the gates have large bubble fucks. You de siege / de NSA and warp to your safe spot till the hunter is gone.
---
​
---
Oh please. The guy has ran his game straight into the ground
---
I had a similar issue on my 8320 with the power mosfets getting too hot. I had a closed loop cooler so the mosfets weren't getting much air over them, but turning the rear fan around from exhaust to intake helped quite a bit
---
Look up some YouTube videos on it I would suggest before actually doing it. There is plenty of people who have done it.
---
So like every other game dont allow logs for chat channels.
---
I hate it, but I run Evemon on a Windows box at work. Otherwise I run EVE, jEveAssets, pyfa, all on Manjaro with no issues.
---
There's already been a post on here where this exact corps was spotted running bot mining fleets, what is CCP doing ?

Get out of here. I'm putting loads of ISK on the line.... They have the opportunity to bait me / defend themselves.
---
You did see the sentence where he said it would need a nerf immediately after local delay/logging changes to make N2 defunct, right?
---
You’re right, AFK VNI ratters shouldn’t be able to make isk either. 
---
I’m not saying it’s simple problem or that I have a perfect solution. I just don’t like that there’s no countermeasure for it. 
---
I’ve been in alliances where a cloaky camper was meaningless and if they drop on you then all you have to do is light your cyno and you’re probably fine. I’ve also been in alliances where a cloaky camper completely disrupted an entire corporation’s means of generating isk because they don’t have the resources to be ready to respond to a tackled carrier 24/7. The solution was either undock something less expensive or do something else.
---
a bit disappointed bud, but i am sure next friday you will be better. fw is not what it was 2-3 years ago sadly but there are still some cool fights and nice people to be had. take a look into min /amarr. Its better for solo play then cal/gal. Especially take a look into friendly targets yt channel cool player mostly active in aus tz.
---
Its perfect for this job for sure. Very cheap. Very effective.
---
Yeah totally.
---
Maybe bring your sec status up A F T E R.
---
And watch our eagles fly!
---
This, or just dump the logs every 10 or so minutes instead of updating them in real-time on the hard drive
---
could you smartbomb this thing in hs?
---
Beautiful picture. U can see hoe big the ships are
---
FIFTH WHY
---
Sure but should you be living in nullsec if you cannot defend yourself? AKA most renters.
---
I don't think so IMO. 
---
Nerf local and both problems are resolved.
---
oh PD &lt;3
---
Because not everyone has brand new car?
---
What do you work in?! 
---
Security?
---
You sir are a hero.
---
Looks like you took /u/williamsoncounty 's advice. Kill ships significantly weaker than yourself, like ventures and bombers. This is a good place to start.
---
I'm very concerned about whether 64b client will reduce clients that can be run per system.
---
Everything's possible in theory. A BS with 8x T2 Large smartbombs does about 2.4k damage per cycle (and you only get 1 8s cycle), so you'd need 51 BS worth, though in practice you'd like more if possible to account for differences in ping, reaction and those people that just can't press 8 buttons in 1 second. So I'd say, 70+ smartbombing BS to be on the safe side. At an estimated cost of about 160m per BS you'd be looking at around 10b isk for an attempt.
---
because caps locks usually means you're raging/yelling friend  (◕‿◕✿) 
---
 in this thread we are all positive towards eachother.
---
Just don't watch the one where Hitler finds out that Bruno Ganz (actor playing Hitler in this clip) has cancer or that Bruno Ganz died. Way too darn sad.
---
Eve has useful tools for seeing price and demand in any given market. Is there any easy tool for seeing the supply in any given market?
---
&gt; “Null-sec isn’t supposed to be safe,” is not a sound argument for a gameplay mechanic with no countermeasure, in my opinion.
---
It's the exact kind of argument that overrides "has no counterplay". Risk/reward balance comes before play/counterplay. It is inherent to the very design of Eve balance. There is risky space you can get a lot of reward, and safe space you can get less reward. You can't bomb, boosh, doomsday in hisec for example. That overrides the functions that bombing plays in the meta otherwise.
---
Meanwhile, "has no counters" itself is not a solid argument actually. Many things have no counters. There is no ingame way for someone to "hack into" a wallet. Money in a wallet is unassailable. There is no counter for appearing in local. You can't hide from locator agents. No way to tackle a -2 align ceptor on a gate. You can't "disable" the slave set of an avatar before killing the ship then the capsule. Lots of stuff in this game has no counters. The question is, whether they should. And that question is settled by looking at the greater ecosystem of Eve and whether it'd be better if the mechanic had counters. As Mar5hy said, camping is an uninteresting (but lots of effort) way of hunting compared to active hunting, but it's the only way to circumvent many mechanics that makes nullsec ultra safe. And nullsec is safer than it should be. So it's a necessary evil until other changes can be made render nullsec less safe.
---
If you count only those 3, you get 34%. I don't know where you learned your counting skills... 
---
Some smaller entities like provi, would probably stay neutral, but side with the Imperial Legacy if they had to. This, because Panfam shit on them many times. The same story with DeadCo, they fucking paid to get some rest for the whole north with the reaction of PH shitting on them? honestly, not sure if DeadCo would side with the Imperial Legacy, but for sure they wont with Panfam anymore.
---
Anyways, that's just the numbers, about 35% vs 55%. Sounds pretty clearly in favour for the Imperial Legacy, you are right. But like I said in the post before: that is only the amount of characters, neither PVP characters, skill value, ship value etc. War was never won with just players. (Fcon with allies still died against smaller entities)
---
It is known that Panfam has rorqs in goons, since it's the safest way to krab. So that would make 5 more characters for goons, while the actual player with his titan would still side with panfam.
---
So as much as fixing one procurer every six seconds?
---
&gt;Cloaky camping is the polar opposite to Local Chat + Intel Bots / networks. Now step back from your crabbing and have a think about how safe you are.
---
&gt;This is nullsec and nullsec should be dangerous.
---
Now step back and think about how safe your eyes are and how little effort is actually needed to set one of these up (not the insane 100+ setup you use) vs the amount of effort people put in to nullify the "hazards" of nullsec.

His ships are the risk factor. If you introduce risks to the risk factor you make a space less risky
---
So therefore hunter and null bear are equal then.. Tadaaaa!
---
Yeah thats a good idea.
---
Thanks!
---
Be prepared to lose another bil+ learning about wormhole sites and the differences between the different classes if you don't want to look it up.
---
No i don't think so. For any one the hunter is vastly superior in strength. But there can be many of them and banding together they can gain much more strength because they didn't forsake having friends to watch their backs like hunters did.
---
My point is the response effort that you can nullify with cloaky camping is vastly disproportionate to how much effort it is to actually cloaky camp.
---
It really irks me how safe ratting has become. IT shows when all these super and carrier pilots are absolute potatoes when they get dropped on.  
---
"Yeah lets boat INTO the bubble and not try to kill the bubble and warp out with usage of the NSA and Fibos."
---
I explore null-sec in a nullified, insta-warp interceptor. Fit your low slots with inertia stabilizers, and rig slots with low friction nozzles, until your align time is than 2s. Fit any spare slot with a tanking module like damage control or shield extenders to help withstand smartbomb gate camps. 
---
NPC null sec is the most safe, so I'd stick with areas like Syndicate or the Great Wildlands.
---
Nice try, but it's not at level of the best Hitler rant
---
here is a question that's been on my mind re: cloaky campers
---
with my understanding of how eve grids work, any ship, even a cloaked ship, extends the edges of the grid it's on, in a ball, 8000km in every direction
---
with this, using some form of advanced grid fu, like having another ship on the edge of your ship's grid ball to see whether it disappears from your overview at the expected distance, shouldn't it be possible to:
---
* a) determine whether there is a ship cloaked on grid with you
---
* b) determine the approximate location of said ship
---
* c) warp between celestials in 8000km increments to find "safespot grids" with cloaked ships on them
---
You just want to rat with no risk :).
---
His face when he lays into my trap.. Priceless.
---
Ohh, I like that idea. It's not perfect (delete local!) but it's a reasonable compromise between competing interests.
---
His face afterwards when everyone is basically saying how stupid you have to be to actually die in a super in delve is even better. Telling too.
---
Mortal strike or tornado would be cool.
---
the free market/open economy is one of EVEs selling points, he probably read some story on the internet that got him interested in the game

An old people thing from the early 2010s
---
There are open source libraries that do OCR and it's exceptionally easy when it's always the same font on the same background. It'd be added to programs like Near2 in less than a week I'm sure.
---
But killing the chat logs (or adding a 10 minute delay) takes next to no effort so I hope it's done. At least we can strike that non-solution off the list then and get to something that might actually work, like reworking local chat.
---
No problem! Any ideas or plans on what you want to focus on activity wise?
---
Do you have to finish all the pve rooms to access the arenas?
---
The risk should be proportional to how much effort people are willing to put in to protect them. I do most of my ratting inside wormholes these days, nothing to be done to make myself safe in there.
---
Only have had an apple watch but the function to ping your phone even when on silent is A++
---
With all the upkeep you have to do with this many characters (skill farms, replacing lost implants/ships, etc) how do you have time to actually play the game?
---
I burst out laughing at the doomchinchilla quip. Totally out of the blue lmao
---
Wormholes are one of the safest ratting places in the game. 
---
You can crit all your wormholes and effectively shut yourself off. As long as you are not in a C6 you are  unlikely to be rolled into.
---
people will just switch to OCR or any of the numerous more questionable methods to pull intel directly from the game client. N2 is actually already pretty limited compared to what those can do, since the logs don't include join/part messages.
---
Holy shit your posting is terrible.
---
I don't understand the people who complain about cloaky camping. How more safe do you want to be? You lose things less often than even highsec
---
SPODBRAIN
---
Eh, all that does is make it a bit less comfortable for intel reporters. Now instead of writing in a chat channel they need to report it to an out of game resource that shares it to the alliance. It would kill near2 as a local standalone app, but still allows for hosted sites that can pool intel from all its users.
---
All you would lose is the ability to drag and drop system and pilot names. The first can be replaced by a simple clickable dotlan-style map, the second is a bit trickier but there are options, one of which is simply use the old intel channels to check names.

Welcome to the game! 
---
also ignore r/eve... it’s mostly full of bittervets who barely play the game and can’t remember how awesome this game was when they first started.
---
One of the other reasons for it not being officially open yet, is that games released in China have to be approved. And for a fairly long time, they weren't being. They've reopened, but there's still a backlog.
---
this post is a cry for local nerf from someone who is sick to spend days playing every month doing this shit and has too much sunken cost to quit.
---
You've got a response for everything except the accusations don't you? Adorable.
---
The caveat here is this only works on people who don't know how to respond or react to blops drops, scaled up it only works on groups who don't establish a decent defense response.
---
Additionally people will ship down to VNIs and similar which offset the 'risk v. reward' and sort of make dropping blops gangs on them moot. As a response to this "downshipping" in PVE ships I trained all my 11+ camping alts to fly lokis (*which I found to be the most adaptable ship*) so my cloaky campers will just solo PVE ships not worthy of a drop.
---
Wahhh help me out this prison. I hate this game. Why cant I leave. 
---
Nahh Joking. I love killing you whiny crabs :P (in game)
---
You're not a mod

3 x PSU @ 800W.  (800 W X 3) X 23h = 55,200W/D X 30 D = 1,656,000W / 1000 = 1,656kWh x $0.13/kWh = $215.28 in the cost of electricity per month...approximately.  Adjust for local variations and taxes of course.  Hmmm.
---
I’m just curious why you don’t just play the game instead of being the “Silver Miner” of cloaky camping?
---
When you get a system going its not too time consuming. The most time consuming part is Deploying / extracting. Check my corp killboard its only me in the corp and you can see i have time to play the game no problem.
---
Yes, this is a risk, and nice that you take it. But i'm talking about the cloaky camper ships, there is nothing in the game to counter that, they are sitting there risk free.
---
Its not a game if you have to keep 100 accounts alive. everyone who has done it knows it and stopped sooner rather than later.
---
Did everyone forgot that this dim wit broke CCP terms of service. Concrete evidence was provided and nothing happened!
---
Requires someone to want to program it.  Also they cant stop every way but I find most programmers are lazy. How do I know. I am one. We dont like making more work for ourselves by trying to perfect everything.
---
I've no idea what this is about, but it scored an IRL chuckle from me, so +1
---
We do though? They are independent renters.
---
Cloaky campy is a necessary part of the nullsec ecosystem.
---
In order to stop OCR from being effective you just need to take a few pixels out if the text at random. It will look normal to humans but it will mess with the algorithms OCR utilizes to tell different characters apart.

---
&gt; the amount of effort people put in to nullify the "hazards" of nullsec.
---
When you consider effort per person it's not much tbh. Take a credit card warrior ratting in a titan in Delve. He ratting is protected by an entity of 50k accounts. How much effort does he or any single in his alliance spends to keep the space safe? All it takes is having allocated accounts ready to drop and pinging alliance when needed.
---
"Effort" argument becomes really shit when you realize it's not like people spend more effort but they just exist blue donuts. Huddling together is not a great achievement that deserves a reward.
---
I had an issue with crappy MOSFETs on AMD boards back in the Phenom days, except that the MOSFETs would just blow instead of throttling the CPU. I fried both my original motherboard and two replacements MSI sent me. They didn't respond to my email after the second one.
---
&gt; Take a credit card warrior ratting in a titan in Delve.
---
And there it is. Goons are the only alliance in the game they are the only example to think about no one else matters.
---
I was thinking about exploring the systems. Ive been looking at the worm hole thing....and I wanna take a look at hunting for anomalies? (noto sure if that's a thing)
---
Keep going!
---
it's likely to increase the ram usage by some amount. hopefully the 32bit client will remain available.
---
At least for TEST we already have a NEAR2 analogue as a web service. Dunno how difficult it would be to expand it to also take direct intel but it doesn't sound too bad.
---
I am in pandemic horde btw. Unless you mean all of EVE Online.
---
If you are gonna give an argument on "how much effort people spend to keep their space safe" Delve is the best example of it. Fuck me for using the best example to analyze your argument right.
---
Yeah, I was in HERO when Test jetted and then deployed to Fountain to farm HERO while They were struggling, siphoning numbers off Brave and others. Dont point to that as your defense because you shitheads worked hard to help smother HERO while it was at its lowest.
---
wormhole krabbing is legit the safest way to make the dankest isk
---
Stupid question, but how doable is that with the new chat system? How likely would it be to break things (again)?
---
still doesn't stop bots. people already use cloaked/tethered bots watching for ships coming through gates.
---
&gt; As a response to this "downshipping" in PVE ships I trained all my 11+ camping alts to fly lokis (which I found to be the most adaptable ship) so my cloaky campers will just solo PVE ships not worthy of a drop.

If you have more than 1hp, you are ready to go.

lol you sound mad
---
They must be bad at it or I perfected it.
---
This is way funnier than it should be!
---
lol just because you have a 800w power supply doesnt mean you pull 800W. Jesus you are dumb. It means its capable of providing 800W.
---
They are countering intel so remove both. Problem solved.
---
Sure if you leave it on you can make mistakes. I don't use it to cloak. I don't use it to gain an unfair advantage. Hence I'm not banned.
---
Do you work with any other cloaky campers? I could only imagine if there were like 3 people running 100+ cloaky accts, you could shut down multiple regions lol
---
You know security team is code for an intern or some guy that was laid off months/years ago.
---
I like doing exploration myself. Though I do it in nullsec and not in wormhole space, plus I go mainly for relic sites.
---
I find it extremely relaxing.
---
Other games do use similar features, but not for this function.  
---
most of them pull the damage logs and parse them into dps/ effectiveness / heals and such. (parsec/starparse for SWTOR)
---
&gt; The caveat here is this only works on people who don't know how to respond or react to blops drops, scaled up it only works on groups who don't establish a decent defense response.
---
Lol what are you even talking about? Cloaky camping is one of the only counters left in this game to huge capital umbrellas. Your coalition recently lost 5 titans to it. It lost 12 supers in 20 days mar5hy was active in Delve (and we had dreads to drop). It forces you to do other things than merely having capitals on standby such as using subcap fleets or having backup plans if someone gets inhibbed. The very occurrance how we got you to permacamp NPC Delve is an example. It's the only mechanic left in the game that forces you to actually spend some effort in your space defense. It changes as many things for "people who know how to respond" as people who do not.
---
The sample image is so blurry that I thought he was Elon Musk
---
It shouldn't be a problem at all because it's just a difference in the way the UI shows the text.  The actual chat system doesn't change. This is more like changing the font color than changing the way the chatbox works.
---
Thats cute. Kinda makes me wanna write up mine.
---
You will probably lose way more, imma give you that
---
It’s just math.  I understand that it may or may not pull that wattage however you, in your examples, seem to be utilizing much of the machine’s capability.  Now instead of attacking me personally and calling me dumb how about responding more appropriately by ummm say, estimating how much you think the machines are using and responding with what your actual expenses are for reference...you know for us “dummies”?
---
Hey me too thank god for plex right?
---
Holy shit this is autism
---
Going from `people are using an entirely EULA compliant program to rat safer` to `people will blatantly break the EULA with bots` is quite the big jump. Under that logic any change to make the game more dangerous can simply be shut down with `people will just run bots`.

Please biomass. Thanks!

There’s a big difference between accidentally cheating, and accidentally getting caught cheating. I don’t see how you could be flying in space not input broadcasting, but then suddenly input broadcast when typing in chat.
---
I have no doubt CCP gave you a second chance because they don’t want to lose 100+ omega accounts. Everyone knows what you are, that some choose to look the other way doesn’t make it right.

Keep going, youre doing gods work here. And dont use broadcasting. It would be a heavy loss for us, the eve communitiy, if youre get permabanned.

An overview with hostile only and nothing else on. Changes = dock up. Problem solved. You don't need OCR at all.

---
You asked the question, I just gave you the answer :p
---
I could agree on most of what you are saying, BUT there are no damn bubbles on any gates in Delve, just to keep things clear. There might be some titans camping and cloaky sabres, but for sure no large bubbles m8.
---
It's like any other battleship but severely overkill for mere highsec missions. Main difference is that you can use a bastion module for extra tank and ewar immunity. They are known loot pinatas so be sure to fly only what you can afford to lose.
---
Haha this guy thinks he's important because he presses f1 in his ferox.

even by TEST standards, x-files were usually really, really stupid
---
they were the ones responsible for the recent dumbo feed: https://zkillboard.com/related/30003170/201904141400/
---
but they also have quite high opinions of themselves and like to do their own things, separate from TEST (ie. their own PvP fleets/roams that did not involve the rest of TEST)
---
11% + 1% + 11% = 23% in case you were wondering how math works

Him saying that he was hacked only for the hacker to smartbomb in Jita and leave nothing else touched is the same as a dude trying to explain to his wife that, “someone must have broke into our bedroom and dropped that used condom before they left without taking anything. Because it can’t be mine- I haven’t had sex in three weeks.”
---
A lot of good people on both sides?
---
They're also russian so joining the russian test pets doesn't seem too unlikely either.
---
You’d think they’d fit right in. TEST is no stranger to a self image completely divorced from reality.
---
But it's not the only example and is the best example of how shifting the meta can damage the little guys. At some point you have to decide who you dislike less and goons aren't advocating stomping on my face every time i turn around.
---
he has a response for everything because he's right and you are wrong tbh.
---
Sure you have the biggest defence fleet in the game though.
---
@mar5hy Would you have been able to camp entire regions before extractor farming?
---
Funny that, when i was in hisec nullsec was the place to be, once i moved to nullsec suddenly wormholes were the place to be. Conveniently the instant i tread into wormholes its suddenly care bear city all up in here. Maybe i should get into cloaky camping so that turns care bear too.
---
i too miss eft. As for your problem can't help sry
---
1. Everyone, espacially the big entities already made too much money
---
2. CCPs changes like Rorq-mining and other stuff made it too easy to aquire basic stuff, so prices on the market can't follow the plexprice, au contraire, ore, minerals and other materials stagnate or even sink
---
3. nullsec is'nt static, but boring. Ihubs and TCUs should be removed from the game, instead they should be a rig for large citadels, rig-slots increased to 5. IHub-Upgrades should be service-modules, requiring fuel. 
---
4. price for Sov should be multiplied, calculated on behalf of the adm. The lower the adm, the higher the price for keeping the system.
---
There was never a proper invasion, just words that leaders used to convince people to log in.

You are assuming that he was flying in space before that based on literally nothing. He could have been using input broadcasting for literally anything else that's not against the rules, like logging characters in. I smell salt.

Q:

&gt; Why don't you all suggest the one fix which would make it harder to have Intel networks with local rather than trying to nerf local?
---
A: We don't suggest it because it won't work.
---
Probably no one would defend their dumbo mistakes anymore.
---
I mean ... my car is 8 years old and does that.
---
If I charged more isk yeah. Plex prices were lower. I rekon it would be possible.
---
OCRing the game client (or looking at red pixels near the overview) is almost certainly against the EULA, though. And major alliances aren't going to use a tool openly which violates the EULA.
---
The problem is not the chat logs, really. People would always be able to type the intel into an out-of-game location with hooks for software to read (e.g. Discord). The problem is that you get instant, 100% reliable intel through local.
---
something comes into local... warp to citidel an interesting mechanic.
---
People that hunt 99% of time only catch people afk.
---
Null is far to safe.
---
it's all about perception, i guess.
---
I'm not sure even you can follow any kind of coherent point in what you are saying atm. 
---
You made a point grounded on "effort to keep nullsec safe". I refuted your point by using the region with the most effort on the line (thus the argument applies to all other regions with least amount of effort). You clinged on the example because in your mind I hate its dwellers. Whereas it was just an example to refute your argument. Now you still keep talking about irrelevant shit like who I like or dislike.
---
Are you in a smalltime region getting camped? Can't you do your VNI or carrier anomaly farming at peace? It's not like you can take a cruiser into the abyss, run DED sites, dive wormholes, or do exploration for similar or better kind of money right? Some of you nullbear folks want the game to cater to you so much that there shouldn't be even the smallest of creative demand on you to do what you want. This game isn't supposed to be like that.
---
He was actively shooting people with multiple bombers at the time. It’s not salt, it’s rightfully calling out a known cheater and hypocrite.
---
prices arent right but the paste works fine for me.
---
U need to go outside more often. Just planted some tomatoes. Its a nice day.
---
For me this is a bit of a BS from him, I mean is like "I am doing this as null became to safe" bulshit, doing this won't make nullsec more dangerous it just limits the isk income from ratting and mining, you are doing this as you like the 5 minutes fame in your pathetic nerd life and get payed to do it by others so you don't have to ask your mama to pay for your accounts. If saving eve gameplay is your goal then why the fk not clear an alliance that has a cloky camper in every single system in null sec and hence delete the use of caps in pve forever, what a load of rubbish. So you hate an external app because is against of the way you wanna play the game, but you are ok with using one (Isboxer) because it suits your need, this is a hipocrisy, you basically bot yourself but for a different reason, and hence you feel superior you consider it to be just :)). I have never used bots in my life nor will I ever do, but if you wanna fight botting then you might wanna start with not using it yourself.
---
Technically maybe I suppose but when the camper is actually afk he is almost certainly at a safe which isn't on grid with you, and when he's on grid he would see you warping around and probably move.
---
Maybe the log scrubber triggers some overzealous scanner but that part wouldn't be needed anymore anyway. It would be a pure web site.
---
They still fight with TEST other guys today.Seems like they were kick by TEST suddenly.
---
&gt; You clung on the example because in your mind I hate its dwellers.
---
I barely know who you are. But here on /r/eve everyone hates them so it's a safe bet to make that any person you are talking to does.
---
&gt;It's not like you can take a cruiser into the abyss, 
---
They can camp traces too.
---
&gt;dive wormholes, or do exploration
---
This is what i do do.
---
&gt; Some of you nullbear folks want the game to cater to you so much that there shouldn't be even the smallest of creative demand on you to do what you want.
---
That's part of my point tho. Right now cloaky camping is 100% uncounterable. Once the eyes are in the system they are not almost impossible but actually impossible to remove. People love to go on and on endlessly about how unsafe i should be, and then go on about how their safety being assured is fair in that light. It strikes me as a huge double standard. "It's okay when i do it."
---
Or its the fact that calling someone a care bear has no actual meaning and it's just a baseless insult for people who don't play the game in way you personally approve of?
---
Reporting intel outside the game isn't against the EULA. And OCR stuff is undetectable, so EULA or not there will be no repercussions. As a person who defends making null more dangerous I think there is a point in saying people will just modify their software. Modifying how chat logs work vs near2 is merely treating the symptom compared to actually doing something about local. And if they do the former then the proposals to change local in any way become weaker as "they just nerfed chat logs so what else do you want".
---
What makes you think they actually ran it past the security team before banning him?
---
More and More TEST members and pets not willing to join the fleet.Since they eating shit too much times from the battle and the TEST leadership.
---
haven't you heard? Test invasion begins next weekend! also, they are under the threat of being evicted atm according to the glorious leader Sappo, so they probably don't wanna go on a offensive war
---
To be frank, even if delayed logging was enabled I'm pretty sure you can still make an audible alert happen when someone is close to your location, only thing you have to do is manually give your position in a web application (which some alliances have) and people report folks in a web application with a system name. and an audible alert can be created, abit more effort but still possible.

Pasting works just fine for me. Maybe you aren't selecting the text properly?

Do not by a shield taitan,get More dread.Since when you kicked by TEST you can only sell them in cheap.
---
Have you actually seen him do it? FYI you can bomb with 7 bombers same server tick and it will look like broadcasting.
---
Your alliance has spread the meme of Mar5hy broadcasting to get him falsely banned. It did the same for me. Both failed. Nobody even pursues the meme anymore. Looks like you are a victim of that kind of brainwash and second hand talk.
---
no, the meaning for a carebear or krab is pretty well defined for a long time now. Reddit user and KarmaFleet pilot Dave Stark is a shining example of one.
---
Is this a fucking quiz question you have or something?
---
And your such an expert on the matter?
---
Sappo is a fucking idiot. He's only alliance CEO because he was the 'memiest' among us. (That is the measure TEST looks for, not actual qualifications, because Sappo has literally none of them.)
---
Olmeca... I hate to break it to you, and this might blow your mind, but a couple other duders and myself essentially wrote the book on "Cloaky Camping and Implementation: A Counter to Capital Umbrellas". Before you ever discovered Delve and this magical umbrella a few of us murder zoned supers and rorquals more effeciently, even with there being ~3% of what Delve has floating in space. The important thing to note as well is that when we ~cloaky camp~ somewhere the ADMs cliff dive, organizations fail, and line members run for the doors. There is plenty of documentation, video, and people to talk to about the Northern offensive for you to learn from.
---
It's like you skipped past the whole comment just to argue - I was simply stating a problem with cloaky camping and how I discovered a solution. It had nothing to do with me challenging any effectiveness, whether Mar5hys campaign in Delve was or was not, and everything to do with presenting challenges I experienced and how I dealt with them.
---
It forces you to do other things than merely having capitals on standby such as using subcap fleets or having backup plans if someone gets inhibbed.
---
This is something we have implimented for a very long time, every once in a while it has to be re-introduced when the PVE group gets filled with a bunch of novice players.
---
&gt;The very occurrance how we got you to permacamp NPC Delve (complete shut down btw) is an example.
---
I permacamped NPC stations because it was hilarious, super entertaining, and done with characters that would otherwise a.) be cloaky camping somewhere or b.) building shit. Luckily NPC Delve is in range of all my industry so not only was I able to create an incredibly exhaustive deterrent to you guys' makeshift offensive, you literally had to - and still do - alarm clock around when me and a couple other dudes are active. Imagine only being good at eve in certain time windows, that's entertaining.

but supply is the same as it was before.  so price is going to go up to compensate.
---
pro tip:  invest in plex.  you can resell it later for the higher price a few months down the road.
---
if they artificially lowered the price, it wouldnt be a real player market.  it would be WOW with artificial prices
---
Frt has started dropping structures in fire co space so I'd say it's a failure

---
Assuming the grid works like you think it does (I don't fully know):
---
a) Yes. But you'd need your own alts at 6-directional position at something like 8010 km from your ship. You shouldn't be able to see your ship if the grid is 8000km. But if there is a cloaky alt 10km from your ship, then the grids should extend and unite, making you able to see your ship. This is easily testable.
---
b) This is almost impossible. You would know the  cloaky ship is exactly 8000 km from you, but that knowledge geometrically gives you the 2d surface of a sphere. You wouldn't know at exactly which spot the cloaked ship is. Mathematically you could use 6 alts to pinpoint it, but that'd take many hours.
---
c) No. 8000km increments are too small given the actual distance between celestials. And the safespot might be between two safespots as well.
---
8010 km is 4977.18 miles
---
\^basically this
---
if you don't like plex prices, sucks to be you
---
Invasion starts next weekend Valkorsia will anchor spam 420 Raitarus while the greatest ever new eden FC PGL will smash them with Dread bombs.
---
no you didnt, you just said it did. anyways, this discussion is moot as neither of us will budge. have a good day.
---
Lost an Athanor, but corpie stole a Fortizar the next day. Win some lose some.
---
And look *fabulous* while doing it!  One of the coolest hulls in the game IMO.
---
There are computers out there learning on their own after giving them some basic information to start with. 
---
I doubt text with a few missing pixels is going to fuck anything up.
---
Eve politics and Downfall memes.
---
Name a more iconic duo, I'll wait.
---
Mate they teach OCR of handwritten text in first semester classes on machine learning now. What you're talking about was the state of the art like 15 years ago.
---
What ?
---
&gt; They can camp traces too.
---
Campers almost never combat scan systems to check for targets (let alone traces). And you can do it in any space with a jumpclone.
---
&gt; Right now cloaky camping is 100% uncounterable. 
---
Uncounterable doesn't mean non-creative, effortless or bad for the game. As I said, lots of things are uncounterable.
---
Also you misunderstand how risk/reward works and how people use the concept of safety. Risk/reward works for farmers. Null is supposed to be unsafe for farmers. They are the ones who owe an inherent risk to the game. Not hunters of farmers. One of the very reasons why anomaly farming exists is for you to take your ship out and take risks (for rewards), so people can tackle you and kill you and thus Eve's cycle of content is functioning.
---
So no, it's not double standards to say farmers should take inherent risks but hunters shouldn't. Meanwhile, an actual fleet dropping anywhere in someone else's sov null is taking a decent risk.
---
ill miss them , so many easy kills
---
Are we talking about PGL again ?
---
&gt;Hey me too thank god for plex right?
---
And that's a large part of what's wrong with this game.
---
Export the fit to EFT format and paste that instead? Not sure what you are crtl-c'ing
---
Christ lol I'm not sure if I'm jealous or pity you for not having a life lol
---
this. 
---
Problem isn't plex prices, problem is its way to easy to make isk atm
---
I think i've figured it out. What my problem is with your position.
---
My gameplay loop works like this: Do PVE to get isk use isk to either accelerate advancement or fund PVP activities.
---
And you want to completely collapse the first part of that loop making the 2nd part impossible because i can't credit card every ship i have to PVP with. In effect your end game is to stop my game .
---
I'm personally not against the idea of removing Near2, the only issue I see is that "local must be nerfed." and that is not the answer in my opinion. People will adapt an innovate when needed, when local gets nerfed people will simply place alts on gates (already done in most popular space and region entry points.). What will you say when that becomes the new meta? Will you say its not fair someone is doing all they can to be "safe". 
---
I don't think most people have an issue with changing local to a certain degree, but at what point do people feel satisfied? Are you going to say its bad for people to want to know what is around them? Do you want to punish people for the castles and infrastructure and networks they create?
---
Confirmed. But nearly as gay as NC.
---
its updated pretty regularly, but is missing the April patch atm.

I know it’s just crazy that here is a way for people that can’t play 15 hours a day to keep up with the basement dwelling neck beards. It’s a travesty

Equally as relevant but old enough to have come across them here and there.
---
Fire leadership were pretty adamant they were invading FRAT in their SOTAs; https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/arbchv/breaking_news_mad_russians_going_to_evict/
---
The problem is the game mechanics, not the players. There should be some scarcity of resource and regionality of resource, to provide a reason to invade others' space; there should be real risk involved in ratting, and mechanics for guerilla tactics or hit-and-fade attacks on ratters, to provide content outside the big set-piece battles; and you should be able to contest space without having to show up to timezone-tanked structure timers several times (during which time more structures can be spammed).
---
And I’m sure the screenshots of his bombers in space with all his characters having said the same thing in local simultaneously are also fake.
---
CCP actually instituted significant internal controls after the T2 episode, and some of the other major fuck-ups. Ideally, the gave newbie Dopamine and his department some proper guidelines on how not mess up again this badly.
---
And you were botting rorquals. It's not baseless accusations, it's rightfully calling out a known botter and hypocrite.
---
The fact that this amount of multiboxing is viable is why EVE is fucked.
---
dumpster fire coalition are pretty braindead, i was referring to legacy.
---
I think even gotg could stomp fire
---
Why is this an "issue"? It's a good thing - that this happened to Brisc exposed the randomness behind some of these decisions, and hopefully resulted in CCP putting in place safeguards. There is little value in everyone continuing to suffer from some misplaced notion of justice that we all need to be in the same boat.
---
Keep up the great work. Thanks for the updates NER team!
---
Eh, I'd rather force them to OCR. It's way more computationally intensive than reading logs and at least wastes someone's processing power.
---
It's the same as any other hobby you had for 12 years, and then someone came and took a total piss on it.

What? Plenty of games allow logs from chat channels.

Besides, if you nerf that they'll just move to an out of game channel that has no such restrictions. There are plenty of legitimate reasons to want chat logs that don't involve cheating.

Literally double Titan #s is "tiny" ty for clearing that up

With boson titans. Because you can drop 20-50 of them and still have tapi well covered. Because you're NC.
---
Again, TAPI have improved mightily. But NC. and Goons are in a world of their own. TAPI can form 100-120 titans on a weekend timer with a week worth of prepinging, NC can easily do 150-200 under the same circumstances. Again talk to me when TAPI can field 200 titans and there will be an argument here but there just simply isn't.
---
You obviously dont understand what a BOT is. Its automation without human interaction. I do everything manually except login which is allowed to be automated.

Reeeeetard.

Been a while since i've seen over 100 titans from nc.
---
FIRE coalition turned out to be nothing but a damp little squib. SBSQ still isn't in the South, too busy ratting/botting up in Branch; XIX, RED, RZR are scared to undock without TEST support. Legacy itself seems unable to make any headway, downshipping from HACs to Harpies more often than not and still managing to feed into the dumpster.

RIP FIRE/Legacy Invasion March 15-April 27, we hardly knew ye.

thanks for sharing, that needs to be updated to reflect sides a little better. I appreciate it

If you *really* feel this is something that needs to be discussed, hit the "Message the moderators" button on the sidebar and link this comment then tell us your issue.
---
It is not healthy. It encourages the usage of microtransactions.
---
 &gt; but a couple other duders and myself essentially wrote the book on "Cloaky Camping and Implementation: A Counter to Capital Umbrellas"
---
 
---
It gives us a chuckle every time you claim self-importance by saying stuff like this while having nothing to show for it. You can't write a book on how to counter capital umbrellas while being in the alliance with -by far- the strongest and most organized one.
---
The best whalers operate vs. the most organized supercap umbrellas and greatest numbers. They don't bring their umbrellas and numbers to other regions and brag when ADMs naturally drop. There is much more achievement in us killing an Avatar in Delve then you killing ADMs in some worse tier region.
---
PS: The best whalers also play the game to kill ships, and not the metagame to kill alliances. Metagame is your emptier way playing Eve. It gets worse when you and your folks assume we have the same goals, and act as if we hate Goons (you are the one who hates alliances, we just wanna kill stuff) and we want to collapse them.
---
 &gt; I was simply stating a problem with cloaky camping and **how I discovered a solution**
---
You were arguing that cloaky camping is only relevant in disorganized space, while it is a method that had some of the best results in most organized space.
---
Also more self importance here lol.
---
&gt; Before you ever discovered Delve and this magical umbrella a few of us murder zoned supers and rorquals more effeciently
---
Do you know first half a year into the Rorquals who murdered the most of them? PL, Inner Hell and Bombers Bar (of which I was an FC). Your coalition is nowhere near that list. You can go to zkill and fact check this claim.
---
&gt; This is something we have implimented for a very long time
---
Seems like you couldn't implement it very well as it didn't stop the killings. And we do notice changes in your defense patterns reacting to our activity. Gatecamps have tripled after I introduced drone booshers to the region for example. There is no point in denying that. It's not a bad thing to evolve space defense as well.
---
&gt; I permacamped NPC stations because it was hilarious, super entertaining
---
Look I respect most ways of playing Eve, although I find it kinda sad you derive fun from having to actively watch station undocks and witnessing them kill stuff when they wanted to. I say you are better than that. You weren't having fun watching stations. You just wanted to protect krabs and derive relevance. My point was that we forced you to camp stations to protect krabs via afk camping. 
---
&gt; What?
---
https://zkillboard.com/group/30/losses/
---
6/11 of the most recent titan losses (the ones in Fountain and Delve) came from our methods that inherently includes afk camping of some sort.
---
I have done actually.
---
Thanks for sharing, I didn't even think this was even possible!  Now pulling this off with 105 clients from one machine would be the ultimate achievement.
---
An OCR based intel reporter would count as a bot.
---
With the right hardware I rekon its possible.
---
Invest in tulips. You can resell them later for a higher price down the road.
---
This greater fool theory stuff only works out if you are accurate at predicting demand. As soon as chinese migration levels off, or even overnight if the chinese restrictions are lifted, you could see a dramatic drop in demand and thus price. Personally I wouldn't bet against plex, but its not an iron law that it will go up forever.
---

---

zkill won't let me adjust the sides and brcat is borked

there's about 200m of gotg losses on the attacker side that don't belong, and about 10b in attacker losses on the defender side (4.9b of drekavacs, 3.5b of dictors) that don't belong, by my reckoning
---
I got something more up to date, thanks for trying
---
List them. List the fuck-ups.
---
What I miss most about EFT is the detailed dps graphs and the ability to create whole scenarios with all kinds of ships affecting each other.
---
I can clearly understand that you interact with your 105 account continuously as you have 105 different pairs of hands and eyes, a lot of human interaction for you to use 105 accounts at the same time, who the fk u kidding nerd !?!? You use software to achieve your goal same as those care Bears that use a software to stay safe, difference is they are not being hypocritical about it. Go run to mama to get you a few more pc so you can permacamp the entire eve universe, then you fixed this broken game :)) good for you, you found your life goal :)) get a fking life and play the game whatever way you wanna do it, stop bragging about how smart you play with "human interaction" on 105 accounts at the same time lol :)) you probably got shit loads of experience using your hands jerking in front of porhub hence your eyes are great so you can play 105 account at the same time... Wake up mate you are just as guilty of fking the game up as the ratters/miners that are using intel to stay safe and BOT, you just wanna change the game the way you like it... You retard you do not own the game... CCP does, if you like it you play it, if not move on, don't be a hypocrite and tell us that you, one individual are playing on 105 account simultaneously using "human interaction" ... Hypocrite....

Given the abruptness and lack of warning, I'd guess some dispute between director level leader(s) of XFIL and test high command.
---
I'm so glad I caught this moment
---
The doctor will see you now
---
I just listed you a bunch of alternatives you can do if you are being camped (and you cba baiting or having a response fleet), some of which make more money than super ratting.
---
My net worth approaches to 2 trillion and I never once anom farmed in nullsec.
---
What's a high bounty on a character in Eve? Something that would make people perk up and pay attention to the  bounty.
---
We counting sabre bubbles and hic bubbles?
---
If you cannot figure out a way to make isk with spoopy camper in system, then you're a bad and don't deserve the isk. Simple as that. If you want to have near-100-percent safe farming, make a highsec alt and never go to scary null space with it.
---
What's a ChemoLoki ?
---
my guess is they go to a drone lands or RMT rental program or fall apart.
---
Dammit, who's gonna lose the token super during every strat op now?!
---
anime. we can fight over anime.
---
Why bot?
---
&gt;  people will simply place alts on gates (already done in most popular space and region entry points.). What will you say when that becomes the new meta? Will you say its not fair someone is doing all they can to be "safe".
---
Lemme field that one. "Alt on gate" provides critically less intel than local, in that it 
---
A) tells you nothing as to whether the player you spotted entering has logged off (log off a single alpha in every system and nothing is safe anymore because they *gasp* could be logged and you wouldn't know. This is so simple and cost-free that I could personally do it 2-3 alts a day and have e.g. Delve done in a month.)
---
B) It requires *constant* attention (or a bot, but those would be fallible and also a breach of EULA). You looked away for a sec? well too bad, the hunter's already in system and you have no idea.
---
C) It tells you absolutely nothing about people who arrived via other means (wormholes, the hunter that logged off lighting a covert cyno), which means you could have a fleet on your face and don't even know it till they decloak, which stands in stark contrast with today, when you can tell the moment they enter system because lol local perfect intel.
---
I understand common sense is a hard skill for some, imagine you tab thru your open clients hiting dscan until you find your target, then focusing on that account. MIND BLOWN
---
I mean rad DID lose it. But it was borrowed.
---
I get that it's popular to shit on TEST right now, but that wasn't the reason Sapporo was picked. Post-Fountain (and FW), when a lot of the oldguard left, Sapporo had been a diplo (I think) for some time by that point and was basically the most active of the remaining leadership. Say what you want about him, but on a personal level, he's a decent dude and currently has the longest tenure out of any other TEST exec. I was there for Montolio, Fras, Skierx, Booda, etc. They were all good people, but Sapporo has been at the helm for a long time now, longer than any of them. TEST has faced some pretty turbulent patches in that timeframe, and he hasn't bailed. Sure, he may not play as often during times (literally everyone should take a break from this game at some point) but he definitely wasn't what you describe. Maybe he is meme(y), but he's taken them through a full eviction and a move across the universe, several coalitions collapses, and other shit. I can't speak so much about recent events because I haven't actively been in TEST with myself or a spy in quite a while, but there are quite a bit more leadership types I'd put in the "idiot" category before Sapporo.
---
My point is, at what bridge do we cross and say I'm satisfied. Any intelligent group will simply scatter alts and keep eyes if local is deleted/nerfed. It does not matter what you do, players WILL do everything they can to feel "safe". If it gets to the point where you are punishing people for that, then something went wrong.
---
My source says TEST HC have gone radio silent on the issue.
---
My guess is they weren't happy with the way things are being handled recently and got the boot for it.
---
hey kid, wanna die in eagles?
---
I've never had either of your problems.
---
[You could always adjust your price preferences for better results](https://i.imgur.com/9EXiYhx.png)
---
Yep common sense ... 3 sec tab, 3 sec Dscan .. let's say 6 sec multiply with 105 accounts equals 630 seconds, so roughly 10 min to cycle between all the accounts, then do it again and again, must be so fun enjoying eve for you, sounds like playing the game with common sense all right :)))
---
Were you able to confirm that TAMA is the reason for the injectors going to 1bil? Last I heard is at best it is a possibility.
---
We just had a world war.
---
More accurately, we need a world war where one of the big powers actually gets evicted / falls apart
---
Delilah!
---
I have zero rorqual pilots, I don’t do any botting or conventional PvE. His camping has no effect on me personally. I’ll call out a cheater when I find one, regardless of what alliance they’re in.
---
Superb post - well put man
---
Now I am not familiar with the exact models mentioned, but I'd be very surprised if a similar setup had a sustained power draw of over 400W, perhaps even as little as 300W.
---
Uhh.. you delusional? Goons got there late so we missed the first timer, and then decided to reinforce the other one in x-7 a couple jumps away, which you guys then ran away from after like 2 minutes.
---
You can spin it based on a battle by battle analysis if you want, but you're just plainly dense if you think the overall situation there was a victory for you guys.
---
if you make something so frustrating that it can only be done effectively with third party programs, of course people will use those third party programs.
---
my view is that the popular complaints re: botting, PvE, cloaky camping and intel networks are primarily game design issues, not something that can be fixed with a technical measure that would prevent programs like Near2 from working.
---
i absolutely hate pve in this game. it's extremely boring and predictable. that's why i bot. i develop my own bot though. purely for fun. and working on it and watching it do stuff has been a lot more fun than doing pve myself. i don't really understand the problem people have with it. it's not like using an aimbot in cs:go, i'm not making up for any lack of skill, as it doesn't take skill to watch a vni spin in circles while watching netflix. i don't run my bots 24/7. i don't rmt. i'm using my programming and reverse engineering skills to play *a sandbox game* in a way i actually enjoy.
---
people who pay for bots and cheat using other people's scripts are pretty fucking lame though.
---
I would say you're either botting, or have a significant amount of startup to use that a fresh player on the server probably wouldn't have.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
Frat and Panfam have been applying, to great success, the "hah, made you login and form nyah nyah" technique and it's irritating some of the line members.
---
Dude, all I'm arguing for is give me a bloody window of opportunity before the perfect, always-on, available-everywhere, free and effortless intel system alerts the krab that I have entered his system.
---
Wah wah but if we do that then players will have to spread and gather intel themselves, Liraal! Oh the humanity! Less krabbing time, more actually-interacting-with-other-players time! We can't have that!
---
But sitting cloaked on a gate registering ships entering isn't fun gameplay, you say, and you are entirely right. But there is a flip side to this - you want a safe space, you work for it. Otherwise you can scoot back to highsec, where the bad people have less power.
---
Updoot for facilitating my laziness. I had no idea that feature existed.
---
TBH, many blame Sapp or PGL, but I feel those 2 are just too overwhelmed with shit. They need to fucking delegate.
---
On the other hand, hope they keep it up. I’d like to see TEST crash.
---
That's cool, the point of my comment (since some spoonfeeding is necessary) was that you have provided zero evidence. You just threw out an accusation and backed it up with "it is known". Well, it isn't know enough for me to know it and what is asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence, hence my sarcastic attempt at ridicule.
---
oh sweet summer child
---
I too was in TEST when Goons invaded fountain, Durr took over, rolled over like a bitch and then retreated to low-sec, all while managing to successfully change history and blame it all on Booda; a narrative Sappo still sticks to, even today.
---
I don't necessarily dislike Sappo. He is good at what he's there for, but not at much else. This whole 'let's get serious guys' narrative he's trying to push is so ironic and hilarious on so many levels. I honestly can't stop laughing long enough to actually get upset.
---
Sappo is most certainly there because he is Meme Master Sappo. No amount of revisions can change that history.
---
I hate current day test as much as anyone else, the general feel for “care more about isk then anything else” irks me. 
---
However, Sappo is a literally the best exec Test could ask for, he’s as unbiased and levelheaded as they come. He’s the only alliance exec that isn’t pretentious about who he is. Day 1 test guys can come in and talk to him about whatever, because he’s there. There’s not many people I know of that can be approached like that in the position he’s in, hell I know people in the alliance below him that can’t be approached like that. That’s just the way he is, and I’m glad he’s stayed that way. 
---
Vily and PGL make big boy plays while sappo does the in-house cleaning, and lord knows Test has in house cleaning to be had. Don’t shit on Sappo because you hate Test and what it is, Sappo’s good people and he earned his way into being the exec. He pulled us out of Catch into WC developed something new there, took us into the abyss into WWB and you know the rest of the story.
---
You may say I’m just drinking the kool aid or whatever, but Sappo is actually good people man. Fuck Piggles tho, he can suck a fat dick, especially after saying that the avengers movies suck.

---
you don't even need OCR to see when a hostile player enters local. just read the colour value of the standing icons.
---
mittens gettin chunky
---
Here's where I disagree. It's not uncommon as a leader of a widely varied alliance to try and put out a message of "We need to do better." People will see what they want to see, bias included, in whatever action or inaction another group does. I read most of the forum post, and while I didn't necessarily agree with all of it, that's all it appeared to be to me. The reality is that TEST sucked up a bunch of people over the last couple years and lost a good chunk of it's identity. I imagine it's kind of a confusing experience to run a group that is partly old guard, partly "WE DA BEST" (PGL + CO), and mostly krabs who only know how to drop Titans/Supers on roaming gangs, or saving Rorquals. I don't really blame him for putting out the message he did, though he apportioned too much blame to the line members and not enough elsewhere. I don't see it as a narrative as much as a "Guys, we really need to get into fucking shape because we're embarassing ourselves."  
---
As for the Booda era, Booda is the one that made the call to move us to lowsec. It wasn't the wrong call, and I think Booda is a great dude. But Booda was the one to make it when we were still using the 4x sentry prophecy's.  
---
 As for apportioning blame: It doesn't matter. New leadership always blames the old during any kind of transition like that. Is Sapporo wrong to blame Booda? Absolutely. We were handed a pretty shitty scenario at the time and it wasn't Boodas doing. True, he told Sort to go eat a fat dick, but Sort later proved why trusting him was a mistake anyway by flipping that sov in a theatre of war that sat unchanged for the entire duration up to that point. Its why I still will have nothing to do with him to this day.

Goons, for example, will shit on Montolio for being crazy. Despite the fact that most of us in leadership at the time (though a bit split, admittedly) felt like he was right. It's all a matter of perspective.
---
:illuminati
---
their leadership made the call to transfer to TQ so we can probably expect to see more and more as time goes by.
---
Hmm or maybe he did leak info but ccp does not want to deal with a lawsuit that could sink the company?
---
CCP actually tried to kill simple OCR bots by forcing chat and overview windows to always be semi-transparent, even on potato mode
---
Cringey AF, the Guys have the best spai network in the game, Mittani is nothing.
---
pbuh btw
---
So, bounties in EVE don't mean much unfortunately. Instead of being a single payout for killing somebody, it it instead a pool of ISK that pays out 20% of the value of anything the target looses to whoever killed them. This means that while some people will have excessively high bounties, they don't act as a good motivator for hunting someone.

the functionality of near2 can be replicated with custom highlights with a sound alert in an irc client. it's not hard.

This show was a trainwreck, that kept accelerating. I felt bad for watching.

Conflagration gives an increased DPS at the cost of tracking speed and capacitor when compared to  multifrequency. As for when to use it? I'd recommend any time where you need damage more then application and cap. There are a significant number of situations where that might be the case so I can't exactly list them for you, but I trust you can figure them out.

Cloaky smartbombing t3s it can be more then just lokis
---
Well the bounty system is kinda messed up so you could put trillions of isk on someone and if they died in an ibis hardly any gets paid out because it’s based on the cost of the hull you died in. Really bounties should be such a cooler system in the game but as they are now and have been for ages they are really just a waste of money.
---
Didn't say I'd be right, but do you have any non meme responses or is it "opsec"?
---
Peace upon being him
---
honestly it's not anymore fun from the other side to join 200 man fleets to wait hours and then be like hey it's a  citadel bash now. Full scale invasion ops are just so mad boring especially now with citadels. Someone said it before but skirmish fleets would be more fun for both sides
---
Booda wasnt a bad leader in the very end because anything he did, but because he pretty much said that he doesnt enjoy the game anymore, barely logs in and also fuck everything anyway. SkirX was the hero we needed to drag TEST outa the dumpster and Sappo did a great job since then, all in all. My two cents.
---
On same sized or shooting at a smaller hull you would probably be better off sticking with multi. If you are shooting something larger the sig difference will usually offset the tracking penalty allowing you to push a bit more dps but that’s really it.
---
Can confirm! Brandnewgay
---
That was a fun read.
---
I once was stuck with my Nyx in Venal and was pretty upset about it. Because Venal is a pretty long way from sentient life in Eve.
---
And the thing is, I drink......A lot. And when I drink I take care of things that annoy me.
---
So I moved my Nyx from 6NJ to X-M in a drunken rage. After 7 jumps where I should at least have lost it in 3 different systems I’m safe.
---
The next day when sober I realized......I shouldn’t own a super and sold my Nyx to a corpmate and been a happy super less Eve player.
---
Maybe I should quit drinking and get a Titan........
---
I'm the motherfucking lizard king
---
Awesome, have fun! It's a bit confusing at first, but you get better over time doing it.
---
Also if you plan to do relic/data sites, I recommend watching the Rule of 6 video explaining the minigame and how to do it:

---
It's from back when Diablo developers messed up [big time.](https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo3/comments/9twlg4/the_do_you_guys_not_have_phones_speech_is/)
---
That is rule lawyering and you know that. You are using a system meant for something else to gain an advantage. It is also a full automatic no-human interface needed action. Aka a script and/or bot, depending on your definition of a bot. 
---
It should be banned.
---
By the end, he was absolutely burned out. That dude stressed himself out beyond fucking belief over everything he inherited. Eventually not wanting to play anymore doesn't make someone a bad leader, it just makes it time to change the guard (which he did).
---
Yeah, people should at least think through what to do in case something happens. Just to prepare. But spodbrain does what spodbrain do best. Die in a fire. \^\^
---
I mean, last few eagle fleets I went on we brawled it out and lost.
---
Losing sucks. 
---
Getting to actually brawl is always good though. Content is like advertising where pretty much any is good imo.
---
CCP's stance has long been that anything that doesn't directly interact with the game is not a bot and not against the rules.
---
Join the roam in a tackle or ewar frig! Ewar especially feels pretty meaningful for me in smaller roams.
---
Let me check the list of largest alliances in game... oh right, Goons and TEST. Yet you still cry how all of EVE (tm) is fighting you?
---
I agree with you however for the sake of it:
---
\- IF CCP decided tomorrow it is an exploit or abuse of unintended use of a mechanic, it is bannable, no matter what some one sided EULA says. An EULA holds no value besides to squash the most common shit in an easy way.
---
\- If OCR is truly undetectable, you have no other option but to cut down on the symptons. But if removing local helps fix the bots and scripts, I am all for it. Just give me a number of how many people in system or something so that I at least know another fleet is there with me :)
---
Just curious, I get that you are doing this to highlight how cancer Cloak campers are - and we can all agree that Bots/AFKers are a problem - but are you also saying that regular non-afk null players are also a problem? 
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
Sorry, I probably worded that wrong. Just curious as to your view on that.
---
I guess my opinion for blood curdling revenge is not to have the Eve community to my dirty work... I was willing to pay more than a few bucks to make someone's game life a living hell for a couple of months.

---
t3 abyssals will do that aswell as running missions in 0.5 at a really slow pace. really just look it up yourself, its not cus its "opsec evil casino money xddd" its just a matter of thinking independently for once in this game and doing your own research.

How do you manage the logistics of skill extraction ? Bringing the extractors to the alts/redeeming them and bringing the injectors to jita ? Cargo blops ?

Also, there's a few test FCs that should definitely take a break from the game. Nothing makes a stratop unfun like the FC deciding to take a 5 minute break to rant at someone for YOLOing a gate after having not called jump on the last 5 gates.

Extractors can be used remotely
---
&gt;It is understood by NER that Goonswarm did have dreads sitting in LXQ, but ultimately decided in the last seconds not to commit those assets to the fight. Without the extra capital forces to mitigate incoming damage, the Unspoken Dread fleet and Leshaks were dispatched with relative ease.
---
Considering they dropped more dreads than we had eagles, it was a bit much for Liberty Squad at this current stage to handle. Especially considering PanFam has backup not too far away.
---
While I commend PanFam on the victory they earned, the rather lavish and special attention to this particular part of the article makes me question your neutrality. Especially considering PanFam fed a near amount of battleships less than a month ago and there was no mention of it in NER afaik. Correct me if I'm wrong though I do miss things.

You can buy tiny heat sinks with self adhesive thermal compound, if they are standard size mosfets they stick right on.

Booda was still quite active after TEST with DIX. I can honestly say he was one of the best dudes I've ever met online &amp; I hope he is well.
---
Except he states a few seconds later that they already had the info about Penif apologizing to Shines, and how Penif hasn't been exactly quiet about it, hinting at more info gathered from spies.

god bless cloaky campers &amp; god bless america

Literally right after the clip.
---
&gt;It gives us a chuckle every time you claim self-importance
---
You're projecting.
---
&gt;The best whalers operate vs. the most organized supercap umbrellas and greatest numbers.
---
GOTG had a very effective and organized response mainly headed-up by RiotRick. They did have less numbers, which meant finding kills required effort. In Delve you can sit on ANY gate and find shit to drop on, it's laughable, and probably the easiest thing in-game to do (*re: killing stuff in Delve*). The skill is in defending people who aren't in fleet, already inhibbed, aren't on comms or aren't communicating, and doing so based on the sole information of knowing there was a snap-increase in local hostile numbers.
---
&gt;You were arguing that cloaky camping is only relevant in disorganized space
---
I literally said "individuals who don't know how to respond to 'x'" and then elaborated about it being scaled to an alliance level. I'll break it down for you: If people are dumb, they die. If there are a lot of people that are dumb, then they die more often. I hope this makes sense.
---
&gt;Also more self importance here lol. 
---
Nice cherry picking, you're god awful at this. If you read my comment in full context it was referring to the cloaky camping and having people rat regardless in ships not worth dropping on. This obviously exceeds your understanding however since you have only been spoon fed content in the most idiot infested target enriched environment in the game. By that I mean you can't do shit elsewhere b/c you're actually bad at the game and all of your accomplishments are directly correlated with the massive amounts of dumb targets in Delve.
---
&gt;Your coalition is nowhere near that list. You can go to zkill and fact check this claim.
---
Oh look, Olmeca introducing more irrelevant commentary not based on the sentence that was referenced. Way to build argument using the accomplishments of others lmao.
---
&gt;And we do notice changes in your defense patterns reacting to our activity.
---
That's why our umbrella is so effective, it constantly adapts to whatever the most active hostile is doing. This requires little-to-no strategic planning or distribution of responsibilities, however, it's just the natural evolution of people forming new ways to get kills re: the small scale stuff you're talking about. A deployment of a threatening, key word threatening, capitals would have a different response.
---
&gt;Look I respect most ways of playing Eve, although I find it kinda sad you derive fun from having to actively watch station undocks
---
Lol @ you assuming I actively watch, I'll typically only pay attention if I get a bubble lossmail. Also lol @ you criticizing someone else's play style when you squad warp around and alt-tab f1 drones off rorquals.
---
&gt;You just wanted to protect krabs and derive relevance.
---
No. You provide entertainment, with your screechings, extensive REEE'ing posts on reddits, and ship kills is why I do it. Protecting crabs is a side-result. I am relevant, I don't need to try. Also lol @ you thinking this somehow 'forced me' into camping stations - it's literally only logic to understand that if people are staging in 'x' stations then it's probably easy to get content out of 'x' stations.
---
&gt;6/11 of the most recent titan losses

God you are pathetic, always trying to stand on the shoulders of others, and those were in Fountain. You literally attempt to twist and manipulate everything to support whatever bullshit narrative you attempt to push, that's why no one will ever take you seriously, you are seen as a joke, and why everyone - **based on actual intelligence** - hates working with you.
---

---
The show this week went from 0  to rage so fast
---
I think those are separate issues with separate solutions. Delaying chat logs would completely neuter Near2 - a program that should be hated by anyone who has ever roamed a hostile ratting pocket, as well as one that is trivial to write. Some people would probably adapt with various screen reading software as others have pointed out, but I'm betting most people would be too lazy for that. 
---
I do agree local needs to be addressed as well though, and I think a delay is a reasonable and easy solution. As a side effect, this would also have an adverse effect on Near2.
---
Russian clown corp.
---
It is true though. He -is- The Mittani. I’ve met him :-).
---
how does a spy network get you the contents of a dm between two people?
---
penif is the spy, we're just pawns.
---
Considering Liberty's willingness to reinforce from 1DQ and large amount of numbers, had you have come in with your "allies" the fight might not have been so completely one sided. I also am curious why Unspoken FC's were not warned about the amount of dreads we formed. I highly doubt the knew and just went anyway, It seems like a slap to the face you let your allies feed so spectacularly
---
&gt;I guess my opinion for blood curdling revenge is not to have the Eve community to my dirty work... I was willing to pay more than a few bucks to make someone's game life a living hell for a couple of months.
---
Bounties in Eve unfortunately are pretty shit because of people killing their own alts or even simple kill trading. They can not be profitable due to this, therefore while the system can be made more elaborate, they will never be meaningful due to the limit.
---
surely they are the chiNC.  ?
---
This fits on so many layers, it's like a perfect lasagne.
---
The only issue I seem to have since last weeks update is that when I right click guns it no longer gives the option to load charges to "all". I have to click-highlight all guns and the right click and load ammo.
---
What's up with that? Anyone else got this issue? Did they really remove that feature?
---
You can extract and inject remotely from any station. 
---
Go to NPC station. Have jita toon. Buy extractors. Contract to camper. Extract. Extractors turn into injectors. Contract to jita trader. Sell :)
---
Its good for large clears of large missions, which are actually less frequent in the grand scheme of things then mid size and small missions and possibly salvaging certain faction rats. Just like any other battleship, it becomes too slow and clunky and is outperformed by cruisers or even battlecruisers when averaging out time spent and including all the travel from mission to mission.
---
If it's not cheating then surely there's no reason to remove logs?
---
I reached out to Panfam, Unspoken, and attempted to find someone from Goonswarm, however, my particular person did not have a connection to the ER sig by the time of writing, or I would have reached out to them as well for comment (if you have someone you can put me in contact with, feel free to message me with their discord tags).
---
I can assure you that it was not done out of bias towards a particular side, but working with information I had that had been corroborated across multiple sources from both sides of that aisle.  In terms of missing battles from the past, there are dozens of them that happen a day.  I look for br's all across the sector, but can only see so much and synthesize so much in a timely manner, so things will be missed. However, if you are in our discord (which I encourage you to do if you are not already), put that stuff in #intel when it happens and I can make sure it is included in reports. I always want to make sure we are as balanced as humanly possible.
---
Please show us your enlightened ways of high sec pve lmao
---
either A) english is not your first language  B)  your really drunk, or C) you didn't get very far at all in school

Thanks so much for the Chat channel recommendation, I really wish there was a resource for player made channels.
---
Thanks tried changing the price source..still not working right
---
According to Boat it has been public knowledge since yesterday. Considering Shines is in the Imperium I wouldn't be surprised if he forwarded that info to the right ears when it happened. I definitely wouldn't know I just press F1 after all.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Yeah that's another thing. 2.9 no charge all. Installed 2.8 in another folder. charge all works. but have the other problems I mentioned with both.
---
common factor: hy.
---
Dude wanted low entry barrier pve for more than a vni.
---
That's what I did, why tell him how to blitz pirate missions or t5abyss or c6 multi dread or rorqual smart bombing in a black hole.
---
But please continue your narrative of "hahaha scrub, I'm so much better"
---
This is an interesting point. I feel like they could probably account for it with the times or some other trade-off, but i don't know for sure.
---
How in Space do you exchange LP for a faction hull?  I'm trying to get a Federation Navy Comet.  I have the requisite LP, the base Tristan in my hangar (not as active ship; tried both packaged and assembled), and the nexus chip in my inventory...  but it's still grayed out.  What gives?  What am I doing wrong?
---
Says a somebody from a dead black legion.
---
Username checks out
---
No idea what the tutorials cover now or how well, but D-Scan is worth a mention I'd bet.
---
Is he the Mittani?
---
While I get where you are coming from in regards to PVE mechanics in this game is stupid boring, you really don't see how you and hundreds, maybe thousands of simultaneously botters affect the economy by causing devaluation of ISK and items in game (astero/loot bots/escalation bots/you name it bots)?
---
Most people AFK ratting have somewhat losses and don't run it near as heavily as most botters do.
---
You are trying to rationalize why, because of your skillset, should be allowed to pull in massive amounts of ISK without even playing the game while other retards actually have to put an effort into it.
---
The amounts of times I've scanned down a VNI within less than 10 seconds of entering a system, without being reported on hostile intel and warped to it with a hyperspatial ceptor, only to see it warp away is staggering.
---
You are part of the problem, like it or not. Don't for a second think that people will swallow your sob story why you or anyone other botter should be entitled to breaking the ruleset because fuck everyone else.
---
Just because it's a sandbox game doesn't mean your cheater actions has zero consequences for others in the same sandbox.
---
Solved the copy and paste problem..I was not copy the bracketed title heading.
---
Still problem with price being wrong even after switching price sources
---
Hope you find peace, friend.
---
&gt;Dont need to nerf local. Just the features near2 utilizes to actually run which are not found in any other mmo I am aware of.
---
Yea really. The game in general sends too much info to external apps of all sorts. Info / data enabling near2 functionality being right at the top.
---
aint seen him look so agitated since 2016
---
Let's recap: You proposed to stop logging chat channels to hard drives. There is no local data-mining possible anymore. (rather naive but let's assume)
---
I proposed that instead of using ingame channels intel gathering and sharing could still easily happen on dedicated webpages with near2-like function. No need for log-analyzing local software - just a web page where people enter their sightings like they would in an intel channel. Even today near2 and similar apps rely on people actually reporting intel to those channels so it wouldn't be a huge and completely unreasonable change.
---
How would that website need an outside program?
---
ky brings the spice, no doubt
---
There is also an ISK fee associated with most LP payouts, which you may not have enough for at this moment.
---
If you can't eat M&amp;Ms out of a bowl with some poisoned ones you are bad and don't deserve M&amp;Ms.
---
according to fuzzworks you need an incursus not a tristan.  I believe it needs to be packaged but I haven't bought a ship in ages.
---
You're missing the point. A lot of low entry shit you can do in Delve aswell.   
---
Its more like your narrative of "hahaha Delve sucks, my ways are so much better" doesn't quite work.  
---
The only thing i agree on is that people should use their brain instead of just going down the hurrdurr VNI path.
---
&gt;So like every other game dont allow logs for chat channels.
---
They do. In fact many have much better damage and death logs etc. But none report your enemies position. There are hacks that sniff out the data and interpret it, and those hacks have on occasions been used to breaking points of even some of the biggest games in history of online PvP gaming. But the developers have never in any PvP game supported or provided direct data that would broadcast to 3rd party apps outside of the game and report your opponents position and movement beyond that which is available from within those games, and have in fact spent a ton of resources combating such hacks and mechanics.
---
Realized I was just copy the module list and not grabbing the bracketed titles at the top
---
&gt;people will just run bots in shitty designed games and mechanics that are made to support instead of inhibit them from the ground up
---
FIFY.
---
I'm confused how is this cringey? All he said was that he was the mittanj
---
Explain why
---
&gt;i'd say that one is questionable, since OCR software is often used by people with vision impairment for accessibility reasons to use software with no screen reader support
---
I'd say legitimate cases of this happening are so rare that it would be a no brainer for anyone to manually verify such cases while going ahead with the "blanket" solution. Sure legit players of such nature will have a disruption, but unfortunately it would be a very small price to pay.
---
Dude I'm saying that delve isn't the end all of pve in this game, the original guy said ppl on serenity shouldn't care about their assets cus delve is so good, I'm telling him that delve isn't so good, there are loads more ways to make more isk because he asked. He thought I was just trolling.
---
I notice this is the solution at which most people arrive: "I died in a ship, therefore I will get a better, more expensive ship, in order to avoid dying next time."
---
The above is not how you win EVE.
---
You can't bait people whos on comms first of all. And you can't organize a response fast enough to stop the gank. So you are starting a fight at a loss already and they have a much stronger chain of escalation.
---
Maybe you should remember that i don't live in Delve. I live under threat of a capital hammer or blops fleet dropping on any of my activities with no response available to me.
---
It nerfs ramjag but doesn't really change power level of solo/small gang jag. We have 2 frigs with shield boost bonus (and 0 with armor repair one, but that's another topic). And also, Minmatar ships are usually supposed to do the "hit and run" tactic, not to be permatanking turbobrawlers.
---
Show me on this orthrus where horde jag rammed you
---
Downvoting for your lack of personal creativity, sirmaam!
---
Minmatar shield bonus goes in line with breacher, jag, vaga, cyclone, sleip, claymore, mael and all that jazz. No resistance bonuses make sense because "hit and run" but turning your duct-taped shieldbooster up to 11 sounds fine with me.

Because they're bought into the narrative from Endie in 2015 that we don't have a good spy network and haven't yet realized Endie was a bullshitter who has no fucking clue.

But Mittens... With the wizard hat... at Fanfest...
---
I've never heard a ceo publicly say: "we are doomed, pack your bags. SELL SELL SELL".
---
The interface says no ISK cost, but either way I have a few million in my wallet.  It's probably the hull issue - I'll try with both an Incursus and a Tristan.

The requirements for reading super simplistic stuff like Eve UI are actually pretty low. In addition, you don't even even need to own one, you can just flat out source a host / cloud.
---
The one area and a beneficial side effect of forcing OCR that I see is that it will raise costs of mass botting. the bots that run 50+ clients will receive an additional increase in cost per client no matter which option they choose. Its still of course no where near enough to put them out of business, but it would be a dent in the right direction.

Say what you want but you guys shouldn’t shit on sappo. That one balled Jew is possibly the best person I ever met in this game and I wish him all the best.
---
I believe there's a PvP room at the end of the pve gauntlet. Check out the stratios video on front-page, it's in that room
---
Imagine being this self absorbed and delusional. Yikes.
---
I agree in principle that a minmatar ship having a shield boost bonus makes sense - really, the hawk is the one that shouldn't have it, that's not a caldari thing *and* having both of their AFs with a tank bonus is weird.
---
However, in this particular case it might be a a workable proposal. I personally don't want the jag changed, precisely because I'm worried that it'll get nerfhammered into the ground for the sins of the ramjag so hard that it becomes useless for anything else. But if it's going to be changed, I would at least hope for a change that hits the ramjag role specifically without nerfing it for other uses, and swapping the shield boost bonus for more DPS would be an example of that.
---
Of course, you have the oddity that it already *has* two damage bonuses, so adding a third would be a bit odd. But they could just do that thing where a ship only gets one bonus but it's extra large - changing the damage bonus from 5% to 10% or swapping the fire rate bonus from 5% to 7.5% both would be a 20% increase in dps from where it is now, which would definitely be welcome.
---
The Incursus was it...  although I had that in my hangar as well.  It just suddenly states working after a few hours of being offline.  FWIW I did try logging of and back on earlier with no results.  Must be some weird glitch, either on CCP's end or with my interface.
---
Either way, thanks for the help!  Fly Safe

yes, in irssi:

Well. Karmafleet doesnt like me. So...

:mea culpa:
---
Sorry for the tech question, planning to build a new computer basically just for eve, I only play two accounts and have to potato mode at a very sputtery 15-20fps.
---
I was planning on a Ryzen 2500G with 16gb of 3000mhz ram, but that cpu looks like a beast at $70, 16gb of ddr3 will be cheeper and I might be able to grab a rx 570 for about the same price?
---
I just read the spring balance "pass" devblog. Nobody who works at CCP knows shit about balance. So no. That's why.
---
This shit is off the fucking rails. Let the spring bullshit happen, then just let it go like "this is what's for dinner, and you are going to eat it" for at least a year.
---
I dunno bro CONCORD is already kinda OP.
---
Shield active tank concepts on ships smaller than a cruiser are very few and only work with a deadspace module anyways and only on bonused hulls. You can allways find more dps ships, but jag is one of the few frigs that can pull off active shield tank. If there was no ramjag, there would emerge another ramming assfrig.
---
If he as that many Eve accounts.  How many of the accounts currently saying he's doing good work are also owned by him?
---
&gt; You're projecting.
---
No, seriously. Baseless senses of self-importance via inflated egos is a problem haunting mega alliance upper management. You got too many people worshipping you, leading you overinflate your achivements. Nullfying the ADMs of Darkness. Lol.
---
&gt; GOTG had a very effective and organized response mainly headed-up by RiotRick.
---
I know Riotrick and what his defense fleet was capable of. They didn't drop 100 titans on any tackled friendly capital or have a boson titan in every gate. You can't simultaneously brag about how Delve is a fortress and uptalk other people's defense capabilities like they match yours. The very psychological benefit of having the largest capital force in case shit hits the fan enables you to use the umbrella much freely.
---
You are bragging about ADM reduction. Mar5hy's afk camping collapsed ADMs in many regions he's currently camping. Collapsing ADMs is a function of what forces you have vs how can the target region respond. You by definition have the largest force, and can collapse any ADM anywhere. However, you're not a real man until you drop 6 dreads in a region with 100 titans online and 1000 more ready to be pinged.
---
&gt; In Delve you can sit on ANY gate and find shit to drop on
---
Abundance of targets doesn't automatically mean you can randomly drop on shit ignoring the response. If you were a good whaler you'd know that.
---
&gt; Lol @ you assuming I actively watch, I'll typically only pay attention if I get a bubble lossmail.
---
Lol we have noticed you coming online many times by us coming online. You're either using a bot of sorts which you can't confess here, or you are actively watching.
---
&gt;  when you squad warp around and alt-tab f1 drones off rorquals.
---
If you were a whaler, you'd also know whaling is more than F1ing on defenseless shit. You can shittalk to me all you want. You prove yourself to be a clown if you shittalk my ingame skills and activities. Even most Delve dwellers say things like "Olmeca is an autist but he's good at what he does".
---
&gt; God you are pathetic, always trying to stand on the shoulders of others
---
I claimed those titans died to afk camping. Didn't even say it was my afk camping. You wouldn't ignore that if you weren't a hateful mouthbreather who's interested in throwing shit rather than the logical consistency of what you're actually saying.
---
&gt; and those were in Fountain
---
I claimed they were part of your coalition, which they were. Also the topic was about how afk camping is effective in organized regions
---
PS: We did kill a Delve Avatar the other day under your total shut down. First of many.
---
&gt; that's why no one will ever take you seriously, you are seen as a joke,
---
I like it when you confuse the narrative your alliance is trying to push with everyone's opinion. Talk to me about living in a bubble.
---
&gt; and why everyone - based on actual intelligence - hates working with you.
---
Citation needed. In fact, the initiative Mar5hy and me have started is one of the most diverse groups in all Eve. You can see it at right side of this [battlereport](https://zkillboard.com/related/30004662/201904051900/).
---
I'm not sure if you are being victim of the narrative your alliance is pushing or you're actively pushing right now.
---
Well discord is a web app so you could just poke around for cross site scr- know what, Nvm.
---
How the fuck does anyone have time to play this game AND write long stories about it?
---
You must not forget how he dumpsters a Shoot First Rev and a Mea Culpa Thanny and some subs (bait, worked) before that: https://zkillboard.com/related/30002063/201904272100/
---
&gt;I can’t fit HAMs on my drone and they don’t allow me to fly it near the airport... What do?
---
You need to inject and use super carrier for that
---
More pvp meta stuff
---
Who the guys
---
I don't disagree with you. I understand my actions have consequences, and since this is a fun thing for me, I actually make a point not to spend any botted ISK on PLEX and pay for my accounts with real money. But I know most people who do what I do don't have the same reservations.
---
Why don’t they just add a few thousand new systems make a band of super aggressive rats between the new sob systems and the old
---
I know you expect me to get angry and/or deny, but I happen to quite agree - If you cannot eat the non-poisonous ones *and are incapable of sourcing a poison-free bowl*, then perhaps it really is prudent to lay off the M&amp;Ms.
---
&gt;If PIBC come to TQ, this will probably ignite another massive war on Serenity. Everyone still there will be fighting over the huge power vacuum PIBC will have left.
---
Heh, have you seen how may players are left on it and what percentages of those are bots / multiboxed farmers ?
---
They have to rebuild the whole customer base from scratch basically first before that can happen. Not saying that they can't but doing so on current Serenity in its current state is well ... GFL with that ...
---
No.
---
lol, it's got nothing to do with that. people don't care if every alliance ceo in the game is actually a goon spy. what they are laughing about in this thread is the attitude of that statement
---
how do you know they're botting if CCP hasn't banned them /s
---
This is what not understanding context looks like
---
Right in the face
---
I heard some people use MTUs to try and get the further off "cans" while they clear tanky enemies, might be worth trying out, if cargo space allows.
---
If you play videogames a real GPU is always a better choice.
---
However, you really don't want to buy a AM3 socket CPU these days. If you are only dual-boxing you can make do with a CPU with fewer cores and upgrade down the line. There are some pretty cheap deals on first-generation Ryzen CPUs if you look around.

Breaking locks are fun. I work with security, so I get the thrill of coding/exploitation and understand \*why\* you do it.
---
With how EVE is made in Python, and how the entire client source code is "protected" behind the encryption of a single DLL file, makes it ridiculously easy to reverse-engineer it. Hell if you really wanted to spend a bit of time, you could make bots run without the actual client by emulating the client&lt;-&gt;server traffic instead. I bet someone out there is doing exactly that.
---
It'd be fun to hear your coding approach.
---
I was also in DIX. Booda is a great dude.

I do t under stand can’t a carrier donkey stomp most pick up small gangs? Why is everyone so scared to move them

Oh crap, forgot about remote extraction :o

Thanks, and thank you for your effort against the plague that is krabbing.
---
&gt; dps bonus
---
did you mean:  
---
4th launcher hardpoint
---
I don’t really mind the Jag having the shield boost bonus. It’s kinda cool and I can’t think of something nice to replace it (more damage seems lame)
---
However, where is my Ishkur with an Armor rep bonus. That’s what we really need
---
No amount of context can justify this amount of douche.
---
Ride his dick somewhere else.
---
I heard he knows Matterol
---
Could also be manic velocity from what i know
---
His eyes are legit creepy
---
I mean do you even have or can afford any of them? Because your assumptions are wrong. People buy t2 bpos to collect and thats mostly it. Any way you look at them, if you use them as an investment it is a bad investment. Eve is stupid easy to make isk and a 1% roi a month is terrrrribleee.
---
You can't enforce what you can't detect. OCR doesn't need to touch the client in any way. But Eve doesn't even have a client-side anti-cheat solution to detect tampering with the client, except for some Serenity-specific code that boots people for blocking connections to the telemetry server.
---
hi judy
---
im scared
---
no you are mad dread postet it before you could
---
It doesn't need the application bonus at all either. I would happily exchange both that and the shield bonus for some decent dps. Maybe also nerf the speed a bit too.

My laptop has a top end 4th gen i7, it does all my work stuff just fine and feels snappy, but you put a game or encoding/rendering load on it and it throttles down to nothing. And I have a feeling it’s getting weird from age.

I’d like to play some games I haven’t been able to play, would getting even the Ryzen 3 with a 570/580 be better?
---
I don’t think I’ll notice the difference between the R3 1200 and R5 2400g cpu, and they both will be far better than what I have now, especially with 16gb of fast ram.

I'm not. My entire playstyle in wormhole space goes kaput the moment that POSes are removed, without a replacement device. :/

Yeah I saw your post on it, had it in my notes. Was contemplating it for the featured kill honestly, but the moracha....

I learnt that the hard way

Oh you have a 1 day 1 news item rule? Didn't know. No worries.

Do ya wanna know why? :)

It's because CCP touched it.

Wormhole space used to be a dangerous place to krab.

I would be more worried about the Chinese government's reaction when they find out they can chat freely on Eve without censorship.

Snuff Out sure is trying to get out ahead of all this.

I dunno why, but I expected Mittens to not look and sound like a pasty fucking nerd.

AFK Mafia never had any trouble with it.

How in the fuck did that happen?

Reading from the game is directly interacting with the game.

what people have access to in delve still easily justifies that intital opinion though don't you think? and having lived in delve before theres much more to it than just pve. say about the cfc what you want but their infrastructure is unequaled in eve.

hope u are well

hi qt

uni, now having a boyfriend and getting in shape has effectively reduced my available time for eve to 0, which i am a little sad about because i really appreciate the community and especially the stories that keep being generated, but i am happy to see the game evolve.

And you have been told why. Just be glad it wasn't Toni that shat on your application.

kk thanks

I think with ISBoxer you can quickly swap between clients, so that wouldn't be too hard with some practice and good rhythm.
