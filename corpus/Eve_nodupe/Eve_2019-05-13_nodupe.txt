well, i found it a pretty good move.  congrats on that! \*obama face\* can we hope for a video with screeching on provi comms?

Meat bag?

Looks like a failed abortion between a capsule and an obelisk.

Broken in 1 vs 1 is still broken, meaning limiting players to a few ship fitting options only is still bad for the game.

---
It's sort of like the special olympics.   You know the participants have some kind of disability, so the right thing to do is just cheer them on anyway.
---
cuz the devs would have to actually play their own game to realize that this would be a good idea
---
The Wally post. In exchange for every gem, there are these...
---
Well, that is certainly one way to look at it, I guess.
---
I’m seeing a lot of lootable wrecks on my D scan in high sec. would it be practical to use an combat probes on a thrasher to locate these areas, and if they are unmanned, loot everything?
---
You do realize, replying to yourself is bad form, right? :)
---
&gt; Maybe they should not be concentrating on instanced pvp
---

---
You seem to be suggesting they just let instanced pvp be broken and non-dynamic. If that is the case, why bother having it in the first place?
---
I'm not really sure what your point is. Do you think I support the capital-beats-everything meta or something?
---
No free sp for you
---
Zzz Zzz Zzz
---
Yeah the frigate is fairly well balanced and the ramp-up doesn't really help so much when the fight time of a typical frigate fight is so much shorter.
---
A solo bhaal will have almost no DPS and I'd be surprised if it could kill the leshak in a reasonable time, even if it got it completely neuted dry to the point the gun stopped working. That might be more of a 0-0 draw really.
---
&gt;just let instanced pvp be broken and non-dynamic. If that is the case, why bother having it in the first place?

Agreed.. remove it.
---
It’s.... freaking same!

Almost

I love the high quality YT-Vids you make, though your knowledge of the game and its mechanics and even theories of your foes' logical intentions is a bit rusty. This however suit you well, as the paranoia fit well into the mindset of what I believe most newbros think at some point during their career.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I also think youtube content won't harm your gameplay if you stage from HS. 
---
Though, a word of advice. 
---
Playing the game solo in my opinion will only give momentarily economic boost and frustration and the opposite of both at a mix, depending on your success. 
---
Find a flock to play with, find someone you can trust, because the interaction between those bonds is what will add value to your time spent other than a green number in the wallet. The green number is just an illusion, something you have learned yourself to understand is a good thing, while what you feel when enjoying success with friends does something real with you, with your feelings.
---
This is my opinion of my theory, but it stands true for my own sake.
---
Fly dangeriously! o7
---
They only spawn if enough people are running the necessary abyss sites.
---
Do you owe me isk Reed?
---
You can't combat scan wrecks, and all wreck show up as having contents on d-scan. You can however look for MTUs.
---
I notice it seems to be only COGGers who are crying in this thread. None of you even lost ships in this fight. What the hell is going on with the alliance since Momo left?!
---
Well with a salvager, they could still be with something. Would I be able to combat scan other collidable objects in the vicinity and salvage the wrecks?
---
I brought up these same points not too far back.
---
The response from this subreddit is that they should be kept the way they are because they are small gang's main counter to carriers.
---
Which IMO is a shit argument limited to a tiny scope. If caps are a problem they should be nerfed instead of throwing subcap balance out the window.
---
It just seems unlikely that EVERY day at the exact same time everyone who runs enough of these sites stops simultaneously.  Even on weekends when more people would in theory be playing there are no kills.
---
More to the point, I feel shortchanged knowing there are only 1600.
---
Is this 1600 of the sample cards with the known solutions or 1600 total cards?
---
Much snappy. Such spelling. Very thought out. So comeback.
---
I have noticed this as well, and the only times I have seen the Proving Conduit spawn was after 09:00 EVE time with Gammas, nothing else at all.
---
I know right!
---
Normal what you look for are either ships or mobile tractor units. Salvaging doesn't even make you go suspect, so you could do that quite safely.
---
Yeah, year to date that is frat and skillu
---
One ban wave out of a years worth of ban waves is a terrible sample size. There's no time for a group to recognize and fix (if they care to) a problem in a sample size of one
---
Of course fraternity was on both the short term (1 ban wave) and long term (1 year) lists, so they're obviously the people to go after for botting with the given information
---
Awesome thank you. I know it wouldn’t be criminal but I also would rather not take a dump on someone else’s money.
---
A kiki hull is 120m in Dodixie. **that** kiki is about 500m total plus a really expensive pod.
---
no its completely not the case... any ship can be hard countered when not in an instanced pvp environment.  FW is a perfect example of this... you can have an ab rail daredevil in a novice plex.  Is this ship extremely oppressive to 90% of ships; yes it is.  But due to dscan mechanics it does not matter; since some won't engage it 1v1.  However,  you can try to do multiple things to kill that dd; gank it or come up with some extremely weird counter.  ((The rail kite dd also unfortunately sucks outside of lowsec)).
---
Instance PvP is the only example where you don't have the choice to disengage and not take the fight.  The battery deimos is also stupid outside of instanced pvp... you cannot break it 1v1... you don't hear people complaining about the deimos.. similar for the sac.  Why because the game is not about 1v1 it never has been.
---
You can be like prometheus external and complain about the game not being ramming 1v1 fair fights (you end up rage quitting).  Why are groups like bombers bar so popular; people like unfair un-consensual pvp.
---
Ccp ‘s version of the “no hands” meme
---
Not seeing where that enables it
---
You seem awfully mad that someone can out-fly you in an intermet spaceship video game.
---
Have you thought about scraping recruitment posts for keywords such as nullsec,pvp, wormhole, etc. so you could automate some of this? 
---
Leave an option for users to report false positives for scraped results allowing you to refine your search.
---
Yes, but even if you report known bots they still bot happily for months (years?) before CCP bans them.  Then they just fire up another convenient free-to-play VNI the next day and are good for another 6 months.
---
.....
---
&gt;are NC and FRT
---
if its these 2...why are you asking for PH and Gobbins?  we not NC.

Not that I'm aware of. r/kansascity may have one, but I've not looked for it. Pretty certain nothing EVE+KC anyway.

If you throw out a cargo container full of 50 faction fortizars they will all warp off and try and loot it.

---
Wow you're edgy
---
And his coaltion renamed to "9/11" incident ? Oh wait that's occidental incident we can't make joke about them
---
When I first encountered a Rorqual, in deep null, they were absolutely not as common as they are today.
---
Now they have Rorquals like we had guys futzing around in battleships for mining [I would rather drink liquid glass than to mine in a battleship]. A Rorqual was a sight to behold.
---
Titans were rare beasts too. They cost 150 billion, sans fitting. Now you can get them for 45 to 55 billion. It’s a different universe.
---
Damn, man. I remember us having a station in 9UY, with Ishukone... how long was that ago...
---
Wow...

Stop talking sense, there is no place for that here sir!

~~Why do some corporations have the ability to select all the options, where others can only select a limited number?~~

It's relatively similar.
---
PEGs extend down into subspace. and they're what make you move.
---
Yeah and  northern coalition pilots are known for their free thinking and ability to engage in player versus player combat without someone telling them who to anchor on, who to shoot, and when/how long to cycle their propulsion module.
---
as a newbie, can you explain a little more what you mean by

&gt;	This however suit you well, as the paranoia fit well into the mindset of what I believe most newbros think at some point during their career.

How do I transfer ownership of a structure from one corp to another?

One of my corp members anchored an Athanor on behalf of the corp as a donation and I want to transfer it to a holding corp but I cannot find the option to do so.

Yalaan-Timirgor Conglomerate is a great corporation under the umbrella of the Brave collective.  Everything so far has been great and I can't think of a single thing to put in the "minus" column.

That doesn’t seem right...quick bj is 1000 plex but a proper fucking costs 40 faction forts?
---
The number of people running T5 have reduced. Le that the random bonus room lands you at 0 on 15+ leshaks.

If you fly a bling T5 ship and just happen to get a starving/tangling etc room it’s basically a no-win.

So what is that? Is it an implant, a skin or a separate pod that is different? On that site it says implant, but on [zkill](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76706605/) is shows as it’s own “ship” (not a normal capsule) without implants. It also has a cost of 10,000 ISK, which is the same as a normal pod.
---
that was a boson and not even a real fight?
---
fuck off tbh

Move to WH space where people have at least some semblance of intelligence.

In b4 CCP reveals that Triglavians are communist
---
It takes like 30 seconds to log in and click the claim rewards box.  Can you not do that when you get home?  Or via laptop?  He'll I drove 28 hours roundtrip to visit my parents this weekend and still made the logins.  Its not like you have to actually play the account.  Just claim the stuff.
---
Are we able to petition CCP for this?
---
The ultimate leak
---
It's an implant that you do not lose, so your pod will always be golden unless you manually remove(and therefore Destroy) the implant. It has it's own implant slot #79 so as not to interfere with implant slots 1-10. It serves no purpose other than to look more shiny in a pod.
---
   Edit: oh and unlike the pod skins you do not need to manually set it each time you want your pod to look unique.
---
Lol am i going to believe you who just gave a shitty dumbass response or OP who gave a thorough quality response/post?

Fucking lul at "You guys are just awful at fittings."  Brah you should see sniper bros going over fits. That dude spends hours. He knows every cruiser like the back of his hand.

Wonder if they changed that from report real money trader?

Fucking what

You miss the point; intelligent enemies are a negative when you're out for ridiculous frags.
---
Report Isk Spammer is still there in the contextual menu from chat. This one requires you to actually bring up their character info.
---
You need to be undocked and in system, then right click it in space.
---
Yeah but allies are intelligent and you can roll for nullspace statics
---
I don't mean that newbros have that mindset all the time, rather that his way of conveying his theories and thoughts might be relatable to most eve-players.
---
At some point one will be in a situation where you may think that people are coming for you, sitting cloaking behind you etc.  But in reality 5 is probably afk, 2 is mining, 1 is ratting etc.
---
You'd want to watch his youtube videos to understand this better.
---
Ya, miss you too.

You got me aroused about this big project, then I was left confused.

In that case should I just invest in a paladin or golem? Or even just stay in my absolution if I am seeking WHole smallish group corp.

Trying to figure out how much the pendulum has swung and what kind of ships are looked for. Flexible training but zero direction other than combat centric play.

Oof

yeah tbh I like the other one

Lurk more

Quit two months ago but I used tripwire whenever my corp didn't require me to use something else. I've used all but the POSPY-made one.

I'm in the process of moving to WH space to live but i've been informed recently that WH space is actually the most carebear space in the entire game. Can you advise?
---
run. run far. run fast. this game will take over your life.
---
   
---
also - welcome to EVE.
---
my biggest tip is that you will get out of this game what you put into it. don't try to play solo. you'll burn out w/o getting to experience the amazing glory that this community brings to the table.
---
EVE isn't so much a game as it is a community of people.
---
They are invading to seize the means of Spod production!
---
I give this joke a 9/11 pretty good but you need to work on the delivery. I knew these guys once that could deliver one hell of a bang but i haven't heard from them since 2001.
---
Context: these are all rental alliances, and a haven for botting due to pretty much exactly that.
---
....... bloody hell
---
that means this 80 bil scam alone has "worked" at least twice in the last three weeks.
---
No wonder so many people have alts dedicated to shitting up Jita.
---
And obviously allow the chance to use an extractor gain a single use back to allow for restructuring SP.
---
I mean, you seem to be expecting to be downvoted to all hell, so I feel like you're already *aware* of how weak your reasoning is.

I like this idea. It really makes it about catching up rather than a titan character within 24 hours of it's creation.
---
Indeed this thing needs to fuck off.
---
dont you Mean ramjets for all the Boost in the world
---
maybe we need extractor aids to mitigate the skill farms
---
This information would have to be volunteered by the advert creator. It is impossible for an application such as this to acquire this information via the API
---
no. I like my reasoning. I'm just acutely aware of how this subreddit works &amp; how many ppl are now addicted to the idea of "but muh injectors!"
---
You’re preaching to the choir lol
---
But you think ccp will shoot themselves in the foot for one of their highest revenue streams?
---
I've tried that in two characters with director roles and I can't find the option.
---
When is the real one?
---
that's not bad either
---
The problem with your reasoning is that it is reliant on outdated thinking.
---
The pool of gamers that actually give a shit about a game that takes *months of doing nothing* before you are legitimately useful is shrinking. MMOs have been shrinking in popularity for a decade. If EVE wants to stay afloat, it needs to come up with ways of getting new players into the mix rapidly. Injectors are a stepping stone in that direction.
---
Plus, I have a *very* hard time believing that a significant percentage of the playerbase is "fast forwarding their abilities to the point of ridiculousness."
---
&gt; I'm just acutely aware of how this subreddit works 
---
If this was true, then you'd be acutely aware that preemptively complaining about downvotes is a self-fulfilling prophecy
---
Apparently being retarded is even more expensive lmao
---
its a character flaw, what can I say :)
---
Only the CEO can do it
---
I want to break free!
---
You don't :P
---
Akschully!
---
ah yes, a drive dot google dot com mystery url for me to click on
---
yep, should help our AU Timezone friends to easier find a corp for them :)
---
Thanks m8, you definitely do a lot of killing in the abyss!
---
It still dies to vedmaks and most HACs, meaning it's laughably easy to counter unless you're in a curse
---
Fuck the Amarr comin' straight from Metropolis
---
Awwhhh its a baby cap fleet, how cute!!!!!!
---
I mean shit, people wouldn't do it if it didn't work.
---
Walking, flipping a coin, whistling a song, and scrolling through FB on your phone are all easy.

However, if you do all four at once, you're likely to run into a signpost.

To all the stunted little monsters using words like retarded and stupid here's a hypothetical for ya: close relative gets pancreatic cancer, spend money on attempts at treatment, pay for funeral, never think of how spaec pixels are arranged, not give one single fuck about pos with big toy in it.
---
Could happen, looking forward to "tough" sounding callous replies from poisonous computer game winners.
---
Regardless, you're not going to take a 400m ship into the abyss that loses to everything except one ship, in the hopes that you can ransom that one ship for money (which they may refuse to do to spite you).
---
Definitely spend the 90 mil extra isk for an enduring shield booster. It uses WAY less cap and boosts for more hp.
---
Who told you that?
---
Me ne frego
---
The Ikitursa is going to be outdamaged by HACs like beam zealot in quite many situations. The Ikitursa can be cool because of tracking (antisupport), high spoolup (grinding down big targets - caps, well-tanked battleships) and some utility. However zealot is better at shooting anything it can track and can kill within 2 minutes (which is typical smallgang scenario), as well as shooting beyond 45k.
---
[https://funkyimg.com/i/2TT2p.png](https://funkyimg.com/i/2TT2p.png) \- dark blood x-ray zealot (44.5k+10k range) vs mystic ikitursa (46.4k range), both with two damage mods, 9th slot gunnery implant and no drugs.
---
Hey, if it preserves your culture...
---
I'll have to go dig it out, but the jist of it was that ratting in wormhole space was the safest most carebare place to rat because some changes to C5s i think it was citadels. Once i get home i'll dig it up for you.
---
by "robust" you mean the possibility to check more options?
---
I'm fairly sure I addressed all but your last point in my OP.
---
as for your last point - re: significant percentage - maybe so, maybe not. but it seems significant enough that a fair amnt of people who post here believe it to be linked to what they consider an in game economy that is currently in downfall. so - if I'm wrong, I'm not the only one by a noticeable amount.
---
Who was FC?
---
no, haven't thought about it yet, maye something to come in the future :)
---
WH Space has some of the best ISK/hr in the game and when done properly can be relatively safe,\* a lot of groups will give you a fight if you roll into them during their prime time hours but there are some that will just dock up, the ones that just dock up are prime targets for eviction which forces them to become content.
---
Since there aren’t really any blues in WH space anyone you come across is fair game, once you start running a site, especially C5 sites, you can’t leave without leaving a ship behind which can easily cost several sites worth of loot so people can be a bit risk averse (and losing a small ratting fleet can easily be 3-4Bil isk).
---
\* You can’t account for people rage rolling into you.
---
I mean, you didn't really address *any* point. You essentially just say:
---
&gt; inadvertently introduced a kind of slow rot 
---
without actually talking about what you mean. You *infer* that the obscenely long time investment it takes for a player to contribute (time that can be spent offline, mind you) promotes a healthy player community, but looking at *literally dozens of other healthy gaming communities that don't rely on forced time spent* we can see that's not a primary factor.
---
Further, what data do you have that even BEGINS to tie injectors to economic instability? Or is that just the latest doomsayer's caw?
---
Funny...corpmates and I always thought the same about the AT....except we're mature enough to acknowledge there are people out there who DO like it, that certainly deserve the attention just as much as our preferred game modes.
---
Correct!
---
aside from I'm not the only one who thinks this, I have no hard numbers. I honestly wish I did. but let's walk it through:
---
new player is intrigued and signs up. they inject themselves fairly quickly into high isk making - rorqual pilot or something. they become insanely isk positive. they realize they can do this in parallel over several accounts. and it spirals from there. then they aren't paying the sub, they're subbing with plex. this increases demand for plex. plex prices go up. and it gets circular from there. this, combined with the obvious bottling issue that's currently the hotbutton topic du jour - means a flood of isk generated and pumped into the game causing inflation, and again... it spirals from there...
---
Yes. if there is plex in the game someone paid for it. it's a good revenue stream for CCP, no doubt. but IMHO it's short ter. gains at the expense of the long term.
---
Nerd

Love me an Astero
---
A solo Bhal would suck a Leshal dry and kill it with even 500dps
---
I literally just said this in another thread on this post. couldn't agree more.
---
Cornfuzed
---
it's replacing the fireside this week.
---
if you don't know when that is, you're the worst spy i've never heard of.
---
so instead of injecting 1 char to do 10 things, i inject 10 chars to do 1 thing. which can all be logged in simultaneously.
---
you've not stopped me doing anything with this idea.
---
if he knew how the sub works, he just wouldn't post piss poor half thought out ideas to begin with.
---
So... you didn't log in due to your own choices. Why should you be rewarded for that?
---
Oi vei
---
It makes me wonder though, are T3C's still that powerfull that they need to be excluded from PVE sites?
---
Can you make fits in t3c's that are more powerfull/versatile?
---
the same 3 killmails were back to back same system, same anom, outside of the umbrella, which only really proves the point about stuff dying where they would already. those rorqs lasted a hefty enough amount of time to get support in but were unable to frag the inhib, they both did unusually low dps to it, probably because whoever injected them never thought it would matter.
---
unsupported caps have always been pretty easy to kill.
---
Good luck for your exporation.
---
meh
---
I was expecting "a lowsec gate to Stain". Disappointed
---
This should be interesting to say the least. However, after spending about an hour and a half in local with him the insane local spam was enough to drive anyone insane. Please link killmails in this post so we can see how creative people can get lol.

pay tax on my ore that i mined, and i pay tax on ratting. this is why null sec has to die.. this shit right here nigga, this shit right here, this shit right here nigga, this shit right here, this is called death..

You nailed it. That is a super important issue CCP should focus their energy on. They fixed balance and sov warfare after all.

Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

---
More color shades to choose from than the mspaint 8bit colors would be nice too. There are tons of possible states for other people to be in and not exactly a rainbow of options. I would use background colors more, but the bright ones are a bit difficult to read text against.
---
Of course there are flaws in my suggestion. It was a raw idea - with lots of room for improvement, of course.
---
However - to address your concern:
---
OK - so now I have 10 accounts... now I have to maintain them. Or 20 accounts.. or 30.. however many you want. They will need upkeep. Upkeep costs time, money, resources in general. 
---
In order to make this feasible for most people, it would take the ability to be isk positive for most of any given day. Which in turn suggests botting. Which means now you have a target on your back, and risk having all those accounts banned eventually.
---
Is my solution perfect? Foolproof? Of course not. But it is a fairly difficult obstacle to overcome. 
---
It is just one more brick in the wall of dissuasion. And I am okay with that.
---
 it depends. Some wh groups will use caps in pvp regularly, some use bhaalgorns and guardians, some do t3cs, nanogang, rattlesnakes/basis, rr trig ships, rr Nestors + VNIS. The list goes on, and you can’t train all of that. The big thing is being flexible. Find a group that sounds like it has a good culture, or good people, (I’ve lucked out and had a series of both) and train what they say makes you useful. Don’t sweat requirements, it’s the attitude and flexibility that is important.
---
It does lengthen the time to reinforce currently as well as shortening the window. Adm 1 = 10 minutes to ref, adm 6 = 60 minutes to ref.
---
Wish they'd just have put the resources into improving faction warfare rather than bolt another thing on.
---
&gt; Im paying double the zkill lossmail value in isk for every kill on Wallymarts over the next 30 days by any non Non-TAPIRIUM of the Galaxy aligned pilots (Imperium, Legacy, GOTG, Unspoken and NSH)

Oh sweet, both of the guys who aren't blue to us will enjoy this contract
---
Shit a 3 monitor boy over here
---
Maybe you should send Phorde to evict NSH like you're trying to get them to do to Unspoken in ER. Or maybe NC could grow a pair and go down there and elite pvp them rather than try to pay somebody else to go do it for them?
---
This is such a stale meme.

Believe it or not it’s an old picture. There was a issue with an old monitor setup where they had to clear the screens.  They are much lower now.

It also was in fleet. Yes, you can invite some of bots in fleet and they will accept it. So fleet warp it, where you want and gf.

Are they still running the whole POS to claim ur sov system still ?

This is not ripe for abuse....no not at all :P

Well...I'm certainly gay for Jay

It’s May 13!
---
hmm have a look at it from the corp-searching-player perspective: you want to find a corp where your selected search options have high priority. 
---
Some adverters just check all boxes - this is the only solution i found so far :/
---
yep, sry .. but to be honest - how many corps with really full TZ coverage (running ops 24/7) are out there?
---
Listing to MC parodies with the corp while bashing makes me happy :)
---
They may be running the sites, but got tired of the 50/50 chance of losing everything. Not everybody likes to gamble
---
Your IRL wallet must be hurting :/
---
Stop working with groups supporting botters and Rmters?

I also noticed that they already stop spawning at about 13:00 eve time on weekends sometimes...

Can we keep politics out of EVE please?

Is this all Unspoken can do, post and reddit and run away from fights.
---
Bc Jovian tech suddenly isn't good enough
---
How would Ikitursa fight kiting mwd ship with tracking distruptor? If Iki is the ship to beat, then why not sacrifice a mid to counter that.
---
There should be one call the Athena
---
If you were told it by spoopy newbies it's wrong, period. Just a heads up. 
---
Citadels don't make wh space safer, not really. More annoying to evict, yes.
---
Before people could warp to a pos with a combat timer. Now they have to warp to a citadel without a combat timer. 
---
At the end of the day tho, wh space is somewhat isolated - if you roll your wormholes, it requires someone to roll in, and given wsapce isn't ultra active, that's not common.
---
As for being a carebear, idk. Taking precautions to make isk safely isn't carebearing imo, it's common fucking sense. Cynos and panic are total bullshit lame mechanics, but if I rorq mine in null for some ungodly reason, I'm fitting both. 
---
You'll find a lot of wpsace groups advertise themselves as pvp corps but then take measures to avoid pvp - excuses, justifications, whatever. 
---
What corp are you looking at? Plz tell me it's not spoopy, because they're a null corp that lives in a wh, by their own admission.
---
No they don't. Your average wspace member isn't much, if at all, better than your average null member. Stop the elitism bullshit already

Some tdsin gila-brained twat isn't smarter than some spod-brained twat.

Shit tier shitpost
---
I hate everyone equally.
---
I think it’s funny keep doing horrible things:
---
did you just assume topic category?
---
No spoopy did not tell me that, their recruiters have been very supportive so far. And i'm not looking at spoopy to be a wormhole corp i'm looking at spoopy to be in a wormhole while still in brave (i don't think that i'm ready to leave brave yet.) The grey eagles are the only corp that extended any kind of offer of joining to me. 
---
And i'll say the same thing i said to them, i don't think i'm ready for the ultra hardcore never crabs all pvp all the time lifestyle. My wallet isn't ready for it i cant afford to just whelp dreads or pirate battleships. I'm still setting up my ability to make isk and pvping with the excess. And learning how to not just straight die in any ship i've invested in some isk to do its job better.
---
Beautiful, but OP as fuck. Survived this balance pass, so enjoy while it lasts.
---
Considering a solid half+ of the time in a site is spent killing the drifter (unless you bring a retarded number of Leshaks) and said drifter scrams you there's a very good chance you have no escape options.
---
Stiletto is an assassin's knife
---
Wow (in 2014)
---
This is pure gold.
---
Toxic male-ediction.
---
But Goons have no bots! Mittens said so!
---
I think ccp turns them off when not enough people are running the sites.
---
Are you running static sites? Kill it with your astra if you aren't going to use a dread
---
Or just use a dread and don't be a bitch, they're fairly cheap.
---
I've yet to see any WH'er leave a fully fit capital in an unfit, offline POS so at least they have that going for them...
---
Spoopy aren't a good place to be imo. They aren't great at wormholes and their leadership is unable to take criticism or accept alternate information. 
---
Most players in eve, even in wspace, aren't great. Don't feel you need to be elite at eve before leaving brave; people can and will teach you in other corps as well. Can't name a corp where I haven't learned in personally. 
---
Very few people are ultra hardcore never pve. Most of them have pvp alts; I can't think of a wh corp they fits that description - maybe some boys in goryn clade, some credit card warriors, that's about it. Almost everyone I know pves to make isk.
---
But also imagine being able to put your money where your mouth is and do something about it...
---
DELETE THIS FOR THE SAKE OF THE FEW OF US STILL TRYING TO GET INTO ABYSSAL PVP!!! I just trained precursor cruisers V damnit!
---
It's not about wanting to feel elite. It's about not wanting to leave my friends behind and having to make new ones.
---
Then you don't look on zkill...? Are you actually blind? No interaction with the community? 
---
Someone in my last corp had the pos pw 1234 and had their floating caps stolen lmao
---
I've seen plenty of offline posses lose the SMA's/caps
---
they upgraded to anchoring an astrahus at the sun afaik
---
shit tier bait
---
This is all that NC can do, ''pay'' for other people to do the hard job cause they wont undock.
---
 Also wtf its just one man how hard did he hurt you that you had to go to reddit to make such a bad post.
---
One of those fancy new PI bots that they run in their supers. Duh.
---
EPSYN is a C4 corp with a C5 static, we aren't shoving a fucking Astra in every decent C5 hole we roll...
---
I'm here to change that.
---
In the past it was more common and perhaps even more understandable, nowadays if you stage out of a hole you should put a Fort in there and just dock up, this Spodbrain had a Keepstar nearby that he could dock in yet instead he chose to use the offlined POS
---

how awesome does your posting have to be to get NCdocked to pay someone else to undock and kill you?
---
So you're static farming? lmao
---
And I know who you are, you're the corp that when they don't want to fight grabs those ancil rr cyclones and pretend you bring a gf
---
It still happens now
---
People still do that
---
Not every bear hole has a fortizar
---
Shit tier bait
---
Go back to /r/dankmemes
---
I proposed this at more then a year ago.
---
It's clearly on the bot's manual:
---
Always check the box: Auto Reject Invitations
---
Clearly this man did not read it.
---
wait until bots will learn how to fly abyss t3 , than you'll get permanent pvp gate
---
I mean, we grab RR Cyclones whenever we don't have the dudes/FCs online for heavy armor, you can bitch about the comps we use as much as you want, at least we bring fights and commit to them (And we never say no to content, the only time we roll holes on active PVPers is when they bring shit we can't hope to break like FAX/Dreads with subcap support...
---
We do also have other doctrines we fly ('Fessors w/ Deacons) and doctrines we are sorting out hulls and fits for (FC can I bring my Drake).
---
The RR Cyclone menace is very effective for it's cost and provides a way for use to fight outnumbered...
---
None of our member's bear holes have forts afaik, they don't leave the dreads they fly in though...
---
People actually say the ares is better then the stiletto?
---
That solves the not losing friends problem but doesn't solve the making new ones one. And i'm mighty terrible at that part.
---
That's different. He put a bubble in the middle of the fortizar model, so of course whatever warped to the fort, ended up inside the bubble, which decloaks them. This doesn't happen on gates, however you can place cans and mobile depos at the edge of the bubble to get the same effect (this works with both stop and drag bubbles)
---
good to know I'm not the only one who thinks this
---
nobody cares about arenas for space lords , who has 0.5 -6 bil for a try . Casual players giving up on arenas super fast
---

---
20:30 eve time is 22:30 for most euros so not terribly surprising that the drop off is there. Afaik abyssal PvP gate spawning in the USTZ has been shit since release because there just seem to be fewer people running these in that tz.
---
As someone above me pointed out the tier 5 mothership site drops you at 0 from a lot of leshaks which most standard tier 5 fits aren't going to do well against so overall abyssal runner numbers might be lower as well.
---
It's even worse: I do not actually plan to fly through all systems. Enjoy this chart illustrating the location of this topic on the official nerdiness scale:

But you are StainGuy?

From my understanding in the TSP you each city is connected with each other:
---
"Given a list of cities and the distances between *each pair* of cities,  what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to  the origin city?" [from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem); emphasis added 
---
In this way it is different from the New Eden warpgate grid.
---
Man, you made a mistake and came out about it....that deserved an upvote in my book. Keep providing quality content please.
---
Landing a jam is pretty easy if you cycle ECM drones. Launch, if they fail dock them, launch your secondary flight, dock them, launch tertiary flight, and so on until it succeeds.
---
Pair in this case refers to a "connected pair of cities". Further down in the "as a graph" section they talk about paths, not pairs, and make no assumptions about the graph being connected (aka every node connected to every other).

Most WH groups are fairly close with each other and welcoming of new members, most groups only require you to be able to fly a cloaky scanner and either a Guard, Drek/Lesh or Loki to fly with them so entry reqs aren't hard either.

I don't know what you want to do, but you can go to wh space as soon as you want. Exploring and similar activities work with much less SP. I would recommend you join a WH Corp and go for it. You can obviously not capital rat in a high class wormhole with 10 mil SP but I don't recommend that as your first activity in wh space anyway ^^
---
So the tooltip doesn't only affect the inventory, it affects useful things like info when you are doing fittings and such, extending the delay is a huge PITA when doing other things, my main issue with the inventory is that its SO FREEKING BIG :/
---
You need to know how to use a core probe launcher, a cloak (at least a prototype one), and skills to do whatever you want to do inside wormholes: exploration skills, combat skills (e.g. battlecruiser), gas-harvesting skills...

Nice dunks TEST.

They were reinforcing a fortizar with feroxes, so they were probably mostly t1 gun fit, being from PH, and were fighting Machs while the fort neuted out the logi.

You don't need SP to live in WH, you just need a cloak, a probe, and a pair of balls.  
---
If you join a WH corp, I think you will hardly fit in the regular pvp doctrine (T2/T3/pirate BS), but if your mates  are kind enough, they will give you a low SP fit or a specific role
---
Wh groups are pretty small and generally friendly.  I know literally everyone in my corp, and a lot of other corps.
---
Why, do you honestly think Unspoken have any kind of diplomatic influence over what Goons do or where they deploy? I bet Goons had never even heard of Cockroach Coalition until they deployed and noticed us shooting the same targets.

I love this skin too, but I only activate it when I'm undocking to hunt.

After the Russian thingy is now over, Eve has turned much more fun again.

One of the surplus joints on his index finger is directly underneath Wally's fingernail, which makes typing a painful, deliberate process.  Consider that the next time you read a Wally post.

Sounds like you found some super elitist WH’ers, most of us aren’t like that, we just like to chat on comms whilst going about our business, though we do often roll for fights/krab hunting and even when you’re making ISK you have to be aware of new sigs.

That's not really how Eve works is it.  Even the lowliest player can "make a difference".  You don't need V skills to do it.
---
Train skills so you can fly a cov ops frigate with decent probing skills and just start daytripping. Aka base out of k-space and just go on trips. Get used to scanning and w-space in general, maybe try to scan down some ships you see on dscan and try to get on grid with them (100k off and cloaked) before they warp off.
---
Then start training for t2 cruisers. In the mean time start looking for corps to join. Any decent wh corp will want you if your a good prober. Even if all you can fly in the beginning are probing/tackle frigates

Apoc. Good for missions, later you can upgrade to Apoc Navy and join armor incursion groups. But don't bother investing a lot into these hulls, eventually you will end up using a Rattlesnake for pve (if you absolutely want to use a BS).

You can check my killboard in the lossesfor both kite and brawl drakes.

Welcome to PEARL ABYSS SPACESHIPS ONLINE

At fan fest!
---
u/WallymartsEve, wanna die to some genuine loyal non-TAPIRIUM members and split the reward? Asking for some friends.
---
`idiot's'.
---
"Toon"? What if we've never been in test?
---
is it time for the quarterly fractual industries nyx whelp already?
---
What day does it end? Monday downtime or Tuesday down time?
---
Upvote kill em all
---
*Go I will. Good relations with the Wallies I have.*
---
REQ super dies in a stupid way. Colour me surprised
---
Get gud
---
Also, why does my pod's name always change back to "Arabella Meyer's Capsule" every time I get in and out of a ship? 
---
#FREETHESHIPNAME
---
&gt; Non-TAPIRIUM of the Galaxy aligned pilots (Imperium, Legacy, GOTG, Unspoken and NSH) 
---
Well there goes 90% of eve
---
What if TEST decided that they wanted a stronger AUTZ so they couldn't be TZ tanked as easily anymore, then saw an incoming group that is in that TZ and got in early while they were being courted from all sides.
---
And now that they're working on the 64bit client there's absolutely zero hope they'd patch something like this into the old client. The best we can hope for is that it's changed some time in the new client.
---
prefer to save 90mil
---
Warp 10 KM from the SUN!
---
Could be fun.
---
Kinda hope this means that Imps and PamFam will not turn up to big WinterCo/Legacy timers.
---
The #1 reason to only go top to bottom when browsing through a list in EVE.
---
armor plate it, hull repper in med, the rest all ECM burst. Make sure to stay close to your fleet mates and let it rip. You can only use one burst at a time but having fitted more just makes... more sense somehow. Also fit an auto targeter and rocket launchers and leech on to the kills. 
---
If you're Russian fit 3 or 4 salvagers.
---
Every interaction i've had with wormholers has been either them curb stomping me and my standing fleet with their super blingy ships or having insults hurled at me for being a "horrible nullsec carebear ruining the game and killing it." It wasn't until recently that i had an interaction from someone who i assume was the recruiter for a corp called the grey eagles who extended an olive branch to me that changed my opinion to maybe they aren't all bad.
---
I'll probably be poking around more in the coming weeks.
---
I dont see how this benefits the game or anyone, other than old(est) players who would obtain an advantage over new ones? 
---
How are injectors bad for the game as they are?
---
&gt;Maybe they should not be concentrating on instanced pvp; where they have to take into account solo 1v1 pvp.
---
So nothing can be overpowered because of cynos?
---
It seems they ignore solo and therefore this new ship is fine.
---
With a drag bubble it’s easier to determine there post catch align, with a stop they could go either way.
---
&gt;and the season is never gunna end.
---
Oh but it will, eventually, when audience numbers plummet further.
---
Yeah you’ll totally be fine with that. Like others have said you can start out in wormholes as soon as you can fit scanner probes and a cloak. If youre looking to join a wh corp you should be able to fly some of the lower sp ships and fits and be able to run c3 sites in a praxis if you have good missle skills. Otherwise just scanning and running data/relic sites in the lower class holes can be quite profitable . Just make sure youre not running the sleeper data/relics. The ones youre looking for will be the pirate named ones like sansha or guristas.
---
That's atleast a lot better.
---
Always take the ransom
---
So the blob makes everything balanced?
---
&gt;Will this new ship be able to tank 100 Feroxes at 70km while projecting DPS back... no it won't.
---
And ECM isnt broken when it fails. Good logic.
---
The guy is fucking retarded. He just ad hocs everything and then nothing is overpowered.
---
&gt;You're embarrassment to yourself and *the toilet bowl*
---
Legacy alone outnumbered the other side at UALX, never mind the fact they had Imperium backup. All of EVE indeed.
---
The Geddon "suffers" from Amarr droneboat issues in that it's more focused on pvp, their Gallente counterparts do better in PVE so it works and you have selectable damage types but it's not great.
---
The apoc is fine, however if you want to use Tachyons or you're severely lacking in fitting skills the Navy Apoc is the one to go for as it has much easier fitting and an extra low slot.
---
The real answer, really, is Nightmare.
---
It is TEST vs all of EVE and TEST might have to fall back on contingency plans if it lost its sov, though said sov is totally safe.  
---
Do try to follow the broadcasts, old boy.
---
Tbh since Dom Trolleone left Delve I only ever see the same 3-4 neuts roaming.
---
Please come and say hello. I get tired of going into Test space to look for action, it kinds feels like I'm beating up my little brother... some new faces in Delve would be nice!
---
they collapsed out of PL into TEST if that's what you mean
---
Judging by the post history hes a high sec missionrunner and for these lasers are meh.
---
Are you mad coz TEST nuked ur Rorqs a few weeks back?
---
I never thought ecm was broken.. You may not like ECM and it was hardly a fun mechanic.  A random chance of a jam bad; however a snake keres at 80km stopping you lock anything is acceptable.
---
Do we need more proof? Garmur and Orth were basically enough to establish that.
---
Make piracy great again
---
Hi mate, reminder of this!
---
stuff can be overpowered like the old svipul that could tank a BC; while doing DPS and speed.
---
Thats the reason is was OP.. since it would dominate multiple classes of ships.. frigates, dessies, cruisers, BCs.  If it simply one 1v1 against similar class ships... less ok since then you would just have a single ship in the game.
---
Not sure thats the case with this new ship.. seems to slow / with only medium levels of projection.
---
another way to go would be to give every advertiser a pool of 15-20 options which can be applied wherever they want :)
---
The main problem with the recruitment channels is that CEOs and corp adverts are mostly lying. Not sure how that site will solve it.
---
advertisers can only check a certain amount of options :)
---
Problems with your ship?
---
* Just stick a cap booster or two on it.
---
hmm, then a pool of selectable options (all in all 15-20) might be a better solution :)
---
Hummm okay... so in the AMARR line, wich Ship would be in your expirience better for PVE?
---
yhea, i forgot to mention but yhea.... Empire Mission Running (current doign Lvl 4 and strugling sometimes)
---
Thanks for the chuckle.
---
If a competent defense fleet reacts in time, you won't be killing a rorq with anything let alone kikis. 
---
The reason people use kikis is because they fit through frig holes and project the most dps. Otherwise it would be bombers, and the same situation would apply.
---
So for i Understand... AMARR BS line is only good for PVP?
---
Apoc is the best in the Amarr line if you are missioning in Amarr space.
---
Yes.
---
Nano HML with a Skirmish command burst for extra speed.
---
Typical "why won't you fight me in the doctrine I want you to fight me in" WH space Bushido bullshit
---
We were repping the inhibs
---
I clicked 'stop my ship'.  Survived.
---
I don't have rorqs
---
Unless you mean init, I'm also not in init...?
---
Does not have anything to do with your use of backdoor batphones to anyone could help you.
---
Not that I blame you, batphone is Eve only premier gameplay.
---
Getting removed from BOT space is as much game as you calling Father Goon to help. Welcome to Eve.
---
Typical BL blobbing with frat and crying about blueballs
---
I don't want to fight t1 bcruisers and I'm not going to ping my corp for it. They'd complain we bring t3s, because we don't own a t1 bcruiser comp. 
---
It's on par with the tdsin response of gilas so they can refuse to commit to a fight. 
---
I get that people don't want to fight - bad tz, not in the mood, whatever - but I'd rather be told nah just roll it over deal with requests for a t1 bcruiser fight.
---
The more people that honour ransoms the more people will accept them.
---
There are much better ships for PVE.            
---
In case of PVE you need to be efficient - why will you want to use a ship that gives you 600dps when gila can give you 700 with better application and tank.    
---
You are in higsec? Go for a rattlesnake 1.400 dps ...
---
I want to be in your fleets
---
No they didn't.
---
You cannot be pirate in lowsec if there is no law in there.
---
well i AM a noob...i Pciked up AMARR bc imo they were the coolest lookign ships.... only Now im starting to udnerstand (a tiny little) bit of Stats and dmg etc etc... so thats why =P but yhea i need to Re-think my training Queue. ;)
---
Check ur flair dude...
---
Same :)
---
24/7? Not many. But my corp has a few dudes in each TZ in our wormhole, enough that I don't want to not include one.
---
how do you get the intel? Zkill or local knowledge?
---
Sounds like you came across some real dickheads, whilst I do present WHs in a positive manner there are certainly some... *less savoury* groups around.
---
Imo if you take the gate, you deserve the goodie box. Fight or no fight. The amount in the box is totally not in proportion with what you're risking to get it.
---
Gosh renters are really bad at pvp. This is hilarious. Nice kills.
---
You get missions against all different sorts of pirates regardless of the space you run in so the apoc will still be less than suboptimal.
---
If you accept ransom, honor the ransom. 
---
If your.. customer just sends you a random amount of isk without any negotiation or ransom offer then it's just a gift and you blown him up.
---
No i get getting shot at by wormholers in null, but every time it's just been an exercise in mash A to not die as fast. That's just been frustrating is all.
---
The people who do abyssal PVP usually don't care about ISK. They tend to be folks with tens of billions to throw around and just want gudfights.
---
I guess they ran out quickly
---
thats the point u retard
---
The Geddon isn't exactly optimal either though. Only a damage bonus on the drones and unbonused Missiles/Turrets. 
---
Personally i'd use the Apoc and just deal, most ammo deals thermal as well which is fine vs most. 
---
The only ones the Apoc is bad against is Minmatar/Angel but even still i reckon i'd do better than the Geddon overall.
---
Gila and rattlesnake have amazing base bonuses for newbies.     
---
Like you just get into hull and get like 70% of the performance you a max skilled pilot can get.           
---
Also CCP ship balance in terms of newbies lacks a lot.      
---
Maybe try something cheap - gnosis or praxis are not so great but they are also skill independent and have bonus to anything you can fit on them.             
---
Basically for PVE you want missiles and drones - they don't use cap and have good application and are not locked on damage type.
---
 &gt; we don't own a t1 bcruiser comp
---
Well gee I think I found a solution to your problem.
---
How else could they manage to evict us from ER.  There is no way they can handle a 200 toon Alliance without them.  
---
Truthfully I don't understand why PH doesn't push in LS' shit and just take over the empire.  It's not like NC. can do a thing on their own.  NC. uses them like a retarded little brother with mongloid strength.
---
Amarr is fine, IF you commit to it. 
---
You have to realize that "good" or "best" means different things to different people. Many see "best" as "allows me to be the most afk/braindead" rather than performing well or not being so boring you want to kill yourself. You have to figure out for yourself what your version of "good" is.
---
So if you like Amarr for whatever reason, and looks is as good a reason as any, and you're willing to commit to it it'll work just fine.
---
There's a fit for navy drakes that keeps up with Talwars. This fit is left as an exercise for the reader, but it exists and it is wonderful
---
Baited
---
true you don't but most doctrines currently in the meta (looking at you eagles and munins) do require a rather hefty skill point investment, now obviously there is tackle and support like crucifiers but eventually people will want to fly the bigger toys and the only way for newer bros to do that is with skill injectors.
---
&gt; Amarr laser ships are fine, IF you commit to it.
---
Disagree!      
---
They are fine if you are shooting stuff that have EM hole and you have almost perfect capacitor /cap usage skills and fit.           
---
For me the only good laser PVE boat is Paladin due to its bonuses and low number of guns.
---
Lasers can do just fine, if you use them right.
---
Now ....you .... i have idea ....... rip my wallet.
---
Wouldn't it be cheaper to kill him yourself?
---
For Amarr as stated i would suggest the Geddon. If you want to keep playing PVE and Amarr i would suggest joining Goons down in Delve tho as during ratting you will only face the regional NPC's and against Blood Raiders laserboats are still not perfect but a lot more usefull than in Missions, where you can run into stuff like an Angel extravaganza (i think that was the name at least) where lasers perform rather bad due to resistance profiles. For lvl 4 missions you want adjustable damage types (missiles or drones) which is why the Rattlesnake beats all other BS there. The geddon offers a drone bonus and launcher hardpoints but it's drone bonus is not really good since its only damage and it doesnt give any boni to missiles. I would still pick it over an apoc any day.
---
ok, i will change the advert creation behavior :)
---
Doing PI 
---
Kappa
---
If you crap fit a laser ship (like most people do) then yes, if you commit to dps and damage application you do SO much dps at mid range (where most lvl 4 missions happen) compared to other turret ships that even vs the wrong npc resists it's still good. And versus the right targets you'll do great.
---
But yes, to use Amarr laserboats you pretty much need maxed out fitting and cap related skills. That's the committing part :)
---
The Apoc offers higher dps (potentially ofc, it always depends on skills) aswell as selectable damage
---
Is that the faction fortizars in 1dq1?

lmao, if lore were a thing or priority, then why the hell do our triglavian ships have the same timer restrictions due to "entagled warpcores" (or whatever technobabble was used)?
---
fite my url
---
I have never used SP. I wonder, how can this affect the economy as a whole? Explain, please.
---
Then again, if someone is already willing to commit so much, then why not for a ship that is more efficient (except ofc the personal preference of amarr victor!)?
---
I am mad. That isn't a proper circle.

Newer bros can't generally afford to inject.  Besides, the typical new character today gets quite a pile of SP totally unlike the retarded characters we began with back in 2003!  We even had learning skills to increase attributes, which you'd spend 3 or 4 weeks training up before doing anything else!  
---
All I'm suggesting is that with this new injecting meta, something important has been lost.  I can't quite put my finger on it.  The prestige of vet status may be one thing (among others).   I feel the same about Alphas.  I don't like them.  
---
But I suppose if I had my way the company would be bankrupt.  I don't know.
---
&gt;So if you like Amarr for whatever reason, and looks is as good a reason as any, and you're willing to commit to it it'll work just fine.
---
Hence my  "So if you like Amarr for whatever reason, and looks is as good a reason  as any, and you're willing to commit to it it'll work just fine." and "You have to figure out for yourself what your version of "good" is." earlier replies. 
---
If you like Amarr ships for whatever reason or you like using lasers and you're NOT braindead and want to pewpew then it will work just fine. Picking something you like less just because people tell you it can be done easier is silly.
---
It's not like you have to be a special snowflake to use laser ships, as said they do SO much mid range dps and damage application they outdo pretty much all other turret ships. And mid range is what matters for most missions.
---

If you're wondering, there was never any intention of our total 60 man fleet fighting your 190 man formup. Our fleet went in specifically to bait you into bridging. 
---
The idea was literally to make the F1 monkeys confused by having them try to bridge rather than them ctrl+spacing immediately. 
---
There's no comms recording/video because i was running both titans and the spy character myself. I don't normally get involved with spying personally, but recent diplomatic oversights on the part of your leadership warranted my return from semi-retirement.

Suffice to say, its good to be back.

Kalevala is a compilation of Karelian and Finnish folklore and mythology by Elias Lönnrot in the 19th century. It is the national epic of Finland. I've always thought it must be where Kalevala Expanse's name comes from.
---
I've absolutely fallen in love with this ship as of late.  Try it out with the Netherworld Striker SKIN... hhnnnnnggggggg.

Also, Iku-Turso appears frequently in Kalevala. That's where I picked it up, used to read the poems and stories as a kid.

I mean, if its really just about looks the dankest ship he could go for is still the Legion. If a Tengu can do good a Legion should too.

Both are horrid for lvl 4 missions. As in terrible. Still, the same applies: they can certainly do it so if one enjoys them go for it.

The Tengu used to do quite good, that said i have no idea how that changed since i left high sec years ago. The T3 rebalance has propably taken its toll on it.
---
the new 'drag causer' is basically a power generator that makes energy for free but still needs to be supplemented with the racial reactors? It's never made sense to me tbh, there's a very long fanfest talk that supposedly explains it if you can be bothered to find it.

---
i remember it well, removal of learning skills was a good thing, letting players have the option to get into the meat of the game soon is a good thing, it means you can have more players coming and going from Eve and its not as detrimental as it used to be. Making the game slightly more casual friendly increases content and makes the universe more lived in.
---
I think GSOL are going to be a bit busy for the next six weeks.  See you tethered to a keepstar sometime soon Killah.
---
I think tuzy stated somewhere that they will be always in the main staging - so i think they will also be deployed during the upcoming war.
---
If you ever find yourself in a position like this over a lossmail and calling them a "fucking idiot", you should question yourself if playing this game is a good activity for you.
---
Can somebody give me a brief explanation of the differences between T1 and T2? Cost, effectiveness, etc. I’m brand new to the game.
---
erm...
---
HML tengu does less than 500 dps with maxed skills, the HAM Tengu has no range so whichever you choose you lose time. It's similar for the Legion: you have range OR dps, not both. And they're both locked in damage types which combined with low max dps means it's really crap. Neither have a drone bay and both tanks very much rely on their T3 resists so they're kinda locked in that regard as well. 
---
Laser BS can make up for their limitations through face melting dps, the T3C don't have that saving grace. Not for missions that is.
---
TAPI is not blue to him, we'll happily go hunt his ass. He's not a structure.
---
I am not surprised that bob would put some highsec-level bounty on Wallymart, because his posting made him feel bad.
---
Skill into mining barges then work your way into exhumers.
---
Personally I would stay in a procuror/skiff when in null.  They tank the rats quite well.  The other barges tend to be paper tanked and can die quite quickly to rats.
---
&gt; Got to laugh at this comment. Our tiny coalition is already fighting against far greater numbers in our skirmish war with BOT 
---
TIL coalitions including goons can still be tiny.
---
For subcap mining Procurer is the way to go. 
---
Supposing you have acess to a rorg fleet for buffs and compressing. :D
---
Mostly newer players go to null after leaving high sec. With it's relative safety, big safe infrastructure, and entire divisions dedicated to skilling newbies it's simply more appealing than mostly dead low sec, and often scary for begginers J-space. Null blob warfare might not required good player skills, but they sometimes lots SP are needed to fly doctrine ships. That's make big market for skill injectors. Eventually newer players gain skills to make use of their SPs, even solo. Or they win EVE.

Yeah I have access to rorq fleets. It's only for a few months while my alt account trains for rorqs

May not be as efficient as others but I enjoyed using a geddon to rat.

Fit cruise launchers, drone links aug in the highs. Fill the middle with omnitracking things, mjd and target painter. The lows reserve for hardeners, reppers, and damage mods. 
---
Use sentry drones at 70-100km and throw cruise missiles out.
---
If you're in Brave fit all salvagers
---

---
I mean..every time NC has come for an armor timer and haven't batphoned PH or PL for it, we've fought for them on our own. I know it might be hard for you to believe being in such a risk adverse alliance, but we'd prefer a good fight even if it means we might lose it and a structure. Maybe you should quit leaning on PH to get things done and your guys might have more fun.
---
Or it’ll make them sub. They aren’t paying either way so if they don’t there’s no loss.
---
Yeah he's cruising our space these days
---
If it's loot that doesn't belong to them or funds alliance SRP I don't really see the issue with expecting them to pay for it if they'd lost it by doing something outside of what they were asked to do.
---
Stay classy.
---
Then Procurer. Mines fastest of the subcaps and the lack of space for ore is easily mitigated by compressing in friendly rorqs.
---
&gt;while bashing
---
soo.. what other online games have you played?

More like a wing was lost, IIRC roughly 3 quarters of the fleet cancelled warp (Myself included) still a nice catch allowed by an oversight but honestly could of been worse given how much and what else was on grid at the time.

---
AoM is already thick as flees in the Osmon area of caldari HS.  They seem to be keeping their actual mining bots out of the alliance atm, but some of the bots reside in what are clearly AoM affiliated corps.
---
For example the Army of Mango corp has had a swarm of babby venture-bots locust harvesting in Kusomonmon for the last week.  CODE has apparently been having a go at them and from what ive been told by one of Codes pilots, the swarm is clearly automated as the bots will warp the pods out during a gank, then turn around and warp them right back into the belt to keep mining as if they still had a ship.
---
Theres another 20+ account swarm ive seen a couple of times in Osmons constellation.  Again, in this case, the corp (cant remember the name) is not in the AoM alliance, but does appear to be operating alongside AoM pilots.
---
&gt;   See you tethered to a keepstar

The problem with eviction ops is that they're really long and draining. The planning of them is very fun, I have not had the execution of one be fun.

I keep WANTING to do the jspace thing for small gang, but null has always treated me better as a staging point. I'm universally in it for the pewpew.
---
It is like 'i will be pirate in nullsec' ... like lowsec and nullsec **ARE PLACES WHERE YOU CAN SHOOT OTHERS**
---
How do you get bots in fleet?
---
Well ok. But why this kid is screaming in the backgroud. Like WTF.
---
All (or at least most) ship names in EVE have their origin in some kind of mythology so it is more than likely that this is no coincidence either.
---
For modules, T2 gear is generally stronger, but more difficult to fit (more pg, cpu and cap usage). Meta versions of modules (such as compact, enduring etc) trade some of that effectiveness for lower fitting requirements, thus offering a middle ground between T1 and T2 gear.
---
T2 ships, however, are a different story. Usually, they are a direct and considerable upgrade from their T1 variant, adding unique or special features or just dealing a lot more damage. They also take a lot more skillpoints to equip - each T2 ship requires the corresponding T1 racial hull to be trained to lvl 5, as well as another skill corresponding to its class. For example, tge Muninn (a Minmatar heavy assault cruiser) requires Minmatar Cruiser V as well as Heavy Assault Cruiser I. They also cost several orders of magnitude more than their T1 variants, and their insurance covers much less, relatively speaking.
---
T2 weapons also require their corresponding weapon skill to be level V to fit them.
---
The fuck is wrong with ancil RR cyclones and why do people bitch about them? Partly seriously asking, partly shaking my head. Is there something the rest of the universe is missing?

It seems like you're bringing a fight to me, and if people have a problem with spider tanking kitey bullshit idk man. We used to bring RR 500mn prophs, we've done RR nestors, RR rattles, in null we still run EXEQUQUQUQUQURORORZ and shit.
---
Seriously tell me more about this RR cyclone menace.
---
It's Alec
---
Gold for you
---
Cheers
---
It’s still work in progress my man
---
RR Cyclones are insanely good for the price and ease of training, we've won so many fights that we had no business winning such as vs nice fit T3Cs, they are also such an off meta pick (prophs are common in Wh space as an Alpha/easy to get to doctrine so people expect them) that initially no one knew how well they'd work.
---
They also can run RR + Neuts without compromising on DPS, especially with the recent CPU buff.
---
Yeah I don't get the "never pve" attitude, it's a way to make isk to fund pvp. I don't do it, because I find it intolerably boring. Trade and industry pay my bills. Is that "less carebear"? Idfk, somebody has to build fuckin ships.
---
In a wormhole? PvE is largely the only way, as people handle their own logistics and putting up contracts for junior FCs to welp is less of a thing lol.

---
Sponds like a hard nerf on the tengu, iirc blingfit they could go to almost 900 dps, but at least on paper a hml legion looks like it could do ok. Over 700 dps with selectable damage.
---
You can shoot others anywhere, you just recieve (different) penalties for doing so in HS and LS...
---
Alternative to rorq mining ? There are actually quite a few, but imo the closest alternative is to paint a wall and observe it for the full duration of the paints drying process.
---
covetor mines the fastest.  procurer has the biggest tank.  retriever has the biggest hold.
---
Good oppurtunity to do this then.
---
What good Corp do you suggest? I'm playing an alpha clone, I'm 17 years old, my time zone is utc+2.
---
I don't know yet I want to do maybe pvp or pve or mining. I'm not really familiar with the rest and since I'm an alpha I'm somewhat limited.
---
See you in 1DQ?
---
That is standard MO for any new ship introduction: make it absurdly overpowered so everybody wants to have it (with the potential PLEX purchase in the process of buying it) and with the hope to lure former customers back in.
---
After a (looooong) while: nerf the shit out of it while claiming to have listened to the community.

If you primarily want to do small gang then a C2 with Null and C5 Statics is pretty much the best hole you can get, consequentially you have to be quite active or you will be evicted.
---
Normal C4s with C4/C5 Statics are all in WH life but you can still stage out of them for NS roaming, most WH fights end up being brawls since it's generally over a specific target (Hole control, Fort etc) but there are some nice Kitey comps out there (we ran Blingy Boosh Barghests a few times, 1.5b per ship but quite fun and effective).
---
But afk-multiboxing Rorquals is "active" gameplay, while us old retards sending around som 5-10 DST in dangerous Lowsec to empty/refill 30+ Towers was sooo passive ....
---
depends if you have spend all the skills in social skills or trading you will need to skill up..so what m trying to say 10 mil sp doesnt say anything if you dont tell us what its invested in. but pretty much all the answers given are correct. you can start daytripping with minimal skills, make a fortune(well kind off) doing relic sites. try your luck at hunting explorers. join a newby friendly wh corp and learn the ropes. you probably wont get in the more heavy pvp focussed groups because of the doctrines we fly. but dont let that discourage you. do what you wanna do and if thats wh (god bess you for that) dont let anyone stop you from doing that. you will get killed, probably multiple times. dont get salty, accept it for what it is and ask the person who killed you what you could have done better. good luck to you and hopefully we will have a chat after i podded you :)
---
btw  reddit MCAV IS RECRUITING :)
---
Presumably, most complained about ECM when it jammed them, not when it failed. How do you determine balance in a "100 Feroxes vs 1 ship" situation? If it dies in one volley or two?
---
The Keres is a joke and should be removed.
---
Check out Brave Newbies!
---
HML legion doesn't do 700 dps. A realistic HAM legion doesn't even do 700 dps, rage HAM have terrible application and pretty much zero range so entirely meaningless in actual use.
---
Maybe you could have every corp pick a main staging area to more truthfully reflect their activity?
---
Also I feel like you should have more finely grained PvP Options. For example to properly differentiate small gang from groups that fly in 20-30 man fleets etc.
---
5:20 TAPI getting it's dick sucked since the beginning
---
they're as bad as 90% of the game's population really, they just don't have to overwhelming numbers to mask it.
---
In general, a combination of the two, in this specific case, neither. If memory serves I literally undocked and decided to wander around and see what happened (note for example no out cyno at the end).
---
No you are right we no longer exist. Carry on.
---
Oh, weird.

Cannot wait to get 30k for a pod!

I think injectors were fine but the afk scalability of other activities in eve sort of made them game-breaking.

I think his CSM term changed Xenuria, any time I've seen him in local over the past year and a bit (which, granted, couldn't have been more than maybe 10 times in my 2.5yrs in goons) there was a noticeable lack 9f autistic screeching.
---
Imagine being this baited
---
That's an interesting comparison, I'll try to sum up my feelings on the matter. 
---
Let's start with the similarities - all three ships offer excellent damage application and range (65km) as well as decent base damage (~280dps), which makes them desirable for anti-support/anti-tackle roles - positions where they get to eliminate the smaller targets from the field which a larger ship might not be able to hit. Ships as small as interceptors will be quickly dispatched by any one of these three ships. They are also very cheap hulls, so they're an excellent platform to learn gang pvp in.
---
Out of all of them, I'd say the Nosprey is the easiest to fly, owing to the nature of missile mechanics. You don't have to worry about transversal, and you get by far the longest range out of the three, so you just worry about keeping a safe distance while reigning rapid light hell on top of various light tackle ships trying to reach you. It also sports a larger tank than most configurations of the other two that I've seen, assuming you go with the XLASB variant. Lastly, they have the mid slots to fit a point and web, as well as some capacitor pressure in the high slots, however the web and neuts are strictly defensive measures. Their downsides, however, are the obnoxious RLML reload times during which you're just floating around uselessly for 35 seconds or so, as well as terrible cap stability in case you decide to forgo a cap booster in the mids. 
---
Nomens offer much more stable damage in a pulse configuration with Scourge ammo, however they have to deal with a shorter range (45km) and transversal mechanics, meaning piloting skill comes into play a lot more. Their tank is a lot flimsier as well, consisting mostly of a medium AAR and a few resist mods. However, a good Nomen pilot will out-perform a good Nosprey pilot, meaning there is a higher skill ceiling with Nomens, as well as a bigger potential. 
---
You will almost always see small gang Nospreys and Nomens fit the same way, which makes them easy to compare directly, however Phantasms come in a broad variety of fits. They can fit an active or a passive tank, they can fit a 10MN, 100MN or even a dual-prop 50/100MN, they can fit either pulse or beam lasers etc, so it's really tough to talk about their performance without naming a fit first. They have better tracking, but much lower range than a Nomen with pulse lasers, they also tend to be slower in AB fits, however their immunity to scramblers is a very valuable feature. They also fit by far the biggest active tank due to their bonus. But at the end of the day, their AB speed means they can't really keep up with the rest of their gang, so they get webbed down and murdered. Phantasms might have the highest skill ceiling out of all three. 
---
If you're new to small gangs, I'd say definitely start with a Nosprey - by far the simplest to fly and still insanely good. Use a Nomen if you're comfortable with your piloting skill - it will force you to learn turrent mechanics, transversal maching and so on. And experiment with phantasms from time to time - maybe you find something appealing in them which motivates you to learn how to fly one really well and impress all the ladies.

Did you forget the drones? The missile subsystem has a drone bonus

---
If you are in PVE ships then keep a better eye on local and as soon as a neut enters system safe up, if you are in PVP ships then it sounds like you are using the wrong ship for the situation.
---
Seems correct. I've lived in one of those before. Also lived in a C5. When living in lowsec I LOVED using the C2 superhighway and would usually fight any wormholers we came across if we didn't have a ridiculous blob.
---
Turns out when you roll through with 500 panhorde guys in thrashers, jspace people don't want to fight you. I wonder why. &gt;_&gt;

Yup, that's us
---
you breaka my hearta QQ
---
Using mediums makes them lose a ton of time traveling around and trying to apply their damage to frigs. Using lights means you don't get the dps.
---
Paper dps is meaningless, it's about applied dps. Travel time due to lack of range and drone or missile travel time all affects overall kill speed so you can pile up the paper dps and go "yup should work" but in reality it's crap :)

What proph fit gets run in jspace? 500mn kiting, or brick?
---
Why the sigAmp, defensive scram on all? These seem very brawly. I do enjoy a good brawl, but I guess they're a LOT better in a limited escalation scenario.
---
That said HOLY CHEAP! These things are almost insurance cost. I'm trying this.
---
Yeah we take fights, but that's just unwinnable and generally not worth trying to deal with.
---
If you want WH gudfites fly Cyclones, if you're lucky you'll find people who haven't fought them before, otherwise Navy Drakes are good, as are 'Fessors with Deacons or Cerbs/ScyFleets with shield logi (Ideally Basilisks, Scimis are ok if your allies aren't experienced with cap chains, T1 logi needs a ton more of them to be viable).
---
holy shit nice job guys !
---
&gt;as people handle their own logistics 
---
Fuck that, give me those sleips/lokis/guards at a 20% mark-up
---
But not as good application and if someones asking for an amarr fit they probably have better laser skills than missile or drone skills.
---
The one time I was able to overlay the fleet-fighting-me-comms the video was fantastic, I would love to do that again.
---
Am i missing a joke here? Guy puts “The Initiative” in his flair, goes on to claim he’s not in the initiative, and apparently he’s baited me into saying he’s in the initiative...and this is hilarious for some reason.
---
Have I missed something?
---
You mean the sort of screechy laughing? I dunno, I guess people who've been a huge cause of loot drama (leading to the alliance having to actually introduce loot rules which was never needed before) think causing loot drama is supremely funny or something.
---
Why did he leave Delve?
---
next challenge: raitaru dyson sphere
---
should take around 850 more if my maths are correct
---
Theres a lot of things you can do to minimize these problems, the lowest effort being sending meds on bigger targets and shooting frigs with missiles. Of course theres ships that do the job more efficient, but a Rattlesnake is also more efficient than any Amarr ship could ever be. But it wasn't about efficiency right? :P
---
Yeah there aren't a lot of things I'd take that fight with. Honestly I'd probably undock some triage bait and try to bomb them. Given the average panhorde pilot you'd probably welp the whole damn fleet at the cost of one baitageddon.
---
Confessors aren't shit in your world? Do tell.
---
I'm mostly exploring different mindsets for gang comps for 10-15 people that punch down into numbers well but don't look obvious.
---
&gt; What proph fit gets run in jspace? 500mn kiting, or brick?
---
Generally 50mn bricks to fly with Lokis/Dreks, 500mn bricks are rare, but they have their own issues (good luck turning without a 50km radius).
---
&gt; Why the sigAmp, defensive scram on all? 
---
They don't all have scrams, we fly a mix of scrams, webs and paints for maximum application. SigAmps are for fighting Scorps/Falcons etc, they are a new addition since the CPU buff allowed use to drop to Co-Proc.
---
&gt; These seem very brawly. I do enjoy a good brawl, but I guess they're a LOT better in a limited escalation scenario.
---
They are 100% brawly, the 50mn is solely to catch a ship which we can then murder, the limited escalation certainly helps us run them - they have very limited sustain with those cap charges which is why in a lot of our fights we kill a few things then all die.
---
&gt; That said HOLY CHEAP! These things are almost insurance cost. I'm trying this.
---
Our corp subsidises them somewhat - we pay 60m for the full T2 fit but even so they are insanely cheap, you'll need about 8 to really start using them well, but they scale almost infinitely since everyship is both DPS and Logi. The downside to this is that they are quite hard to multibox since it's like multiboxing a loki and a Scimi at the same time per account.
---
It's still very good isk that is outshone by very few krabbing activities in the game and can be done with a group of 3-4 in carrier/super ratting esque safety.
---
#addscramstoc5anoms
---
How many characters do you have?   If it's just the 1 I would get an Endurance and head over to an ice field.  I like its getthefuckouttahereability, low cost and relative high yield (right now my cycle time is about 56s).
---
rick died for your sins you filthy bot
---
also, TD'ing a nyx fc hello
---
+1 for this guy , I am also curious
---
The fact that every ship can be hard-countered doesn't mean that CCP should completely forget about 1v1 ship balance.
---
Good 1v1 balance is especially important for newer players for instance, who don't have a library of a zillion ship fittings and their strengths &amp; weaknesses in their head.
---
20% on high value to shipping cost is honestly ridiculous. The only thing I will mark up that high is frigs, since a 50m frig costing me 5m to import is probably not getting sold under 65 lol.
---
It’s the 13th man :)
---
is the zkillboard link not enought to get a short overview of the area where the corp is active?
---
ok i might consider the second point! :)
---
it’s not about the activity it’s about the company :)
---
check this out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU882393x0s
---
Low application costs damage indeed, but so does shooting the wrong damage type. It's propably true that better laser skills are a given here but since he seems to be a new player were propably talking about only a few days of real skilltime advantage.
---
best and worst in same [time. lol](https://time.lol)
---
&gt; Yeah there aren't a lot of things I'd take that fight with. Honestly I'd probably undock some triage bait and try to bomb them. Given the average panhorde pilot you'd probably welp the whole damn fleet at the cost of one baitageddon.
---
Since we live in a C4 our caps are kept docked most of the time ti minimize potential info in case someone wants to evict us. Our best answer to that fleet wwould be a bait Geddon sat untethered on a Fort, wait for them to warp in and engage then drop a buble and PDS them.
---
&gt; Confessors aren't shit in your world? Do tell.
---
In Wolf Rayets they are scary, low sig combined with good DPS and the ability to move around fast makes it hard to run away from them. They aren't the  be-all end-all small ship fleet but they are certainly very strong, especially against larger targets.
---
&gt; I'm mostly exploring different mindsets for gang comps for 10-15 people that punch down into numbers well but don't look obvious.
---
Assuming it's a WH then Cyclones, Cyclones, Cyclones, otherwise even normal drakes can work well - people think you are going for the meme factor but they have a nasty tank and on a hole you are likely to be brawling regardless, if it's in K-Space then Cyclones can work but die to kitey gangs, 'Fessors are ok but struggle vs RLML escalation and Drakes are pretty much carrier fodder,
---
Por que no dos?

Our next project is already underway, if you ever visit you'll see what's happening 😜

« I N T R A L I N K E D »

First make your way to NPC Delve, there is a constellation of systems that are not held by goon sovereignty, with a NPC station that you can set a death clone to.  Once you do that, you have a base to start from and can explore the surrounding systems and without fear of having to fly all the way back when you die.
---
To be honest, the hardest part of getting here might be the lowsec gate campers on the main route from amarr.
---
Even so, he used an axon grave, not a single quotation mark (apostrophe).
---
I know that's terribly nitpicky. But i thought that served him right, being nitpicky himself...
---
make sense
---
Yeah I'm getting some ideas on how I can tune this concept for nullsec. It definitely gives me a different perspective on heavy brawling doctrines. I do agree drakes are carrier fodder. I feel like if the gang is small enough maybe we wouldn't get caps dropped on us lol.
---
Ok I will try to look into them.
---
What if I can't fly Enyo?
---
Send a mail to security@ccpgames.com with the details. Laugh maniacally as you press send.
---
I mean, we've been making more progress than them in terms of blowing citadels up. Not too many of our big structures have gone down, and we've blown up countless forts/tataras/sotiyos/azbels etc.  
---
I know people going to be like "but you're just goon pets now so ofc they died with imperium support".  Well, it's not like that. NC. declared war first. So, we let goons use structures to stage an offensive sig deployment to help counteract the massive difference in power. They are still not blue to this day, and they are shot just like everyone else outside of fleets.  
---
Guess it's just that whole mentality of "well they against us so they must be with them" sorta thing? I dunno, I just wanna have fun and blow things up without it getting all political but it always seems to.
---
damn, i always get those two messed up.... CCP should habve not given them such similar names. :D
---
It's for fighters but lmao his fighters we're 1k off
---
I have a very dim view on NS alliances after I ran a Solo 100mn legion and PHorde dropped 2 carriers on me, luckily 100mn Legions don't give a flying fuck about carriers and no one had the bright idea to bring a rapier/huginn or launch dromis so I just moonwalked out of there.
---
Running Cyclones in NS with 10-15 people would certainly be a fun experiment, not sure how well it would work though (and you can't fight carriers with them, though amusingly we have used them along with Sleps/HFIs to kill a few dreads before).
---
Correct, but according to longstanding Waffles cultural norms Wood's ships should instead be prefixed WISH (Wood Industries SHip).
---
Goddamm. Imagine trying to bash all of this down lmao
---
Querious Bot Club mostly.
---
DREDDIT IS RECRUITING.
---
That's because the only available quotation mark on a keyboard is neutral (or dumb).  The axon grave is more equivalent to the left open quotation mark and the keyboard single quotation mark to the closed.
---
heh, i find the barges names to probably be the most descriptive in game. 
---
covet - yearn to possess or have (something). (hence yeild)
---
procure - obtain (something), especially with care or effort. (hence tank)
---
retrieve - get or bring (something) back; regain possession of. (hence hold)
---
I was in horde during the brave/rote/pfr/etc version. Was some good times until agreements between panfam and narm / ncpl / etc ruined it. Having half your fun shouted down by reeing diplos "there's a sov op going on 50 jumps from here and one guy in the fleet is blue, stand down" was really all she wrote.
---
What happened to eve, man? Everyone just wants to fucking bot, whine, and overescalate now. I go out four times a week looking for fights and 80% of what we get amount to ganks.
---
So you use mediums to travel far away to dps bigger targets and then use HML (which apply for crap) vs frigs. Sounds like the worst of both worlds.
---
Just grab a Tachyon nightmare and blow shit up, problem solved. I'm willing to bet that unless you REALLY get terrible NPC resists Nightmare vs Rattlesnake **in actual mission completion time** don't differ much and in some cases will be won by the NM.
---
Incoming wormhole!
---
Vala didn’t make it in time to stop the formation of this one :(
---
I miss Delve :(
---
His posts are coarse and irritating, and they get everywhere.
---
We're not blue to goons, we're just not at war. We roam to delve and shoot each other, they camp our jump bridges. There are fights. No, we don't go bash each other's stuff or try to take each other's sov, that would be aids for both sides anyway.
---
I have no idea what this narrative is about. If any sov war broke out on a huge scale I'm fairly sure test would blue goons for it, yes. It would be boring, like any large scale sov war.
---
What? If you can use '  for the ending of a quote, why not for the beginning. That's what i see all over the place.
---
There doesn't seem to be open and closed marks...
---
Zkill shows that it's still pretty busy in there, but I doubt that it isn't an ISK positive activity for very many people. I think the price of the ships that the average person in there has come down a bit though. Around half the losses are showing as over a billion, and I'm sure that there's a few people throwing in 10B+ fits into the arena fairly regularly.
---
The thing is, if you brought T3s we’d still go in on you, Cyclones are a fantastic doctrine for “fuck it, let’s see what we can kill before we go down”.
---
Well i like flying the hecate and the malediction. I never fly any of my PVE ships into PVP unless it's a last resort. But its not like i can field strong ships. It's try and fight with my cruisers or down or just stay docked and don't fight. My frustration comes from dying so fast that i don't even know what i did wrong.
---
PI man. Train up all three characters and figure out something to run there. It's the most passive mining you'll get.
---
his level of levels has reduced a lot, but we still weaponize him in locals of strategic value
---
lmoa
---
So do I. I'm in b0rt for the b0rt core guys that like to run small gangs and have actual fun in eve. There's RL bros there, and some good long term eve buddies. Otherwise I wouldn't have left galmil. Good bunch there too.
---
You definitely can't fight carriers with these, no. Fighters just apply too well to them. I'm currently derusting and experimenting to find some things I want to run at this small gang level. I'm not getting back into alliance FCing, as much as giant balls of drunk tunnel snakes were fun sometimes.
---
Indeed
---
Maybe to counter inactive/dead corp you could delete add for a corp that did not have any kills over the last three months
---
So why defend Goon structures when there isn’t a Goon in sight if “they are shot just like everyone else outside of fleets”.
---
It was good times when you all would just roll into a system and we’d shoot at each other. That was good content and great fun.  Now, not so much...
---
REEKing of bots
---
Only blues
---
Miner/ratter drama has caused a lot of wars, especially civil wars
---
Exactly
---
I can imagine a few reasons.
---
1. People don't run Abyssals in cruisers as much as they used to, as doing it in frigates is more profitable and you are putting less ISK at risk.
---
2. People don't like gambling their 1+ bil ships on the rock-paper-scissors 1v1 cruiser meta
---
3. People that have the money and skills to run Abyssals probably just do something else during that TZ (i.e. Rorq mining or capital ratting, as it's more secure)
---
I don't think CCP just shuts it down because "fuck USTZ lmao"
---
Why? Content if anything. We've always done things for content. If people we're fighting attack anything, we're always going to go and take a fight.   
---
Can see how looking outside/in it looks like we're just doing it to defend a structure for example. But the reality is we just want to fight everything that comes through.
---
That's just retarded and ends in you shooting your own damn fleet.
---
Travel far away? T3's are fast, you can just sit ontop of them and frigs will die in one missile salvo.  
---
And how a NM is supposed to be faster than a ship that can easily blow up 2 targets it takes for 1 would really be interesting to hear.
---
There aren't on keyboards and typewriters.  That's the point.
---
If they bring ships like Navy Ospreys, Scythe Fleets, T3Cs or Navy Omens then small ships will have a hard time fighting them, the Malediction is good, but it can be hard to fly effectively (keeping transversal up, making sure to be at the right range etc), if there’s other people on comms try make a small fleet with T1 logi and cruisers - rlml caracals with scythes is quite spooky for enemy interceptors (though if they scout your fleet they can just bring a hard counter to it), trying to fight blinged faction/T2/T3 stuff in cheaper ships is always difficult, but it can provide useful experience later on in your EVE journey.
---
Standings, so -10 to +10, not Corp, Alliance and Fleet. They're listed as separate on the overview.
---
Grr goons.
---
The drone regions initially had just a string of random letters and numbers as names similar to most null-sec system.  
---
Players got the chance the name them, don't remember the exact details but I think it was the current sov holder that where allowed to chose the name.
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/new-region-names-announced.-1
---
Hecate + drag bubble is never a bad idea. Keep a offline cloak in your utility high slot, lows are DCU/ancil/2x mag stab, mids are dual web scram mwd, rigs are just hull buffer. If you can catch someone getting lazy and going gate to gate in something small it’s an easy kill. If there’s a response or if you need to afk just offline the webs and cloak up. Also carry a depot with hull reps so you can repair any damage you take.
---
I agree it's bad for eve, all of this blob warfare driven "content" has been bad for eve for a long time. There's no REASON for fewer gangs, scramble fleets, wormhole dives into foreign space, etc. There are a few corps in test with cores that do it constantly and want more enemies to do it to.
---
The problem is, Test is huge, and these cores, in these corps, amount to what? 200-300 guys total?
---
These are the 200-300 guys that fleet up 4+ times a week, though. These are the guys we should care about. Not just as an alliance, but as eve players. They give the fights.
---
I'm aware, it's just lame and I'm not gonna ping for it
---
Happily pay it, laziness fee is real.
---
Then roll an alpha and start exploiting dat bounty money with Wally for a split
---
I flew in B0rt a few years back, pretty sure I’m blacklisted from Dreddit because ~reasons~ (fuck if I know, went AFK for a while, came back after being purged and when I reapplied it was denied with a “don’t apply again” style message), luckily I met the EPSYN dudes and they’ve been absolutely fantastic to fly with, always willing to go on roams to fight NS dudes even if there’s little chance of winning or making it home.
---
&gt; You definitely can't fight carriers with these, no. Fighters just apply too well to them.
---
We haven’t tried since the application nerf so it may well be possible nowadays if you bring like 20 of them, regardless, they are a great fleet to try a few times, even if they aren’t the greatest comp on earth.

/u/wallymartseve
---
Let me kill you and I will share the profits.
---
there is dedicated discord server for this, sadly can't find the link
---
Very simple. First of all for a Rattle to insta kill something it needs to drop sentries, meaning it doesn't move. If you use normal drones we're back to square one with drone travel time. Secondly cruise apply terribly vs even size, smaller or moving targets. Solving the damage application issues for both weapon systems means losing paper dps.
---
Now to the NM, it has amazing tracking for the range it has and it does insta damage (being a turret). In the majority of missions NPC start at range and come straight at you meaning there's none or very little (if your ship is moving) tracking issues so you blap stuff quite fast, it's decently high ROF (&lt;7 seconds) helps with this. If stuff DOES get close you use light drones but most of the time they don't even make it that far. Either way you don't have to wait for it.
---
Instant damage, good tracking, high dps, good range. On top of that it is FAST. Again, paper dps is not the same as mission completion time.
---
Well, that was the thing, people kept docking up. Only way to get em to come out was to knock on the door so to say.
---
I think what you are looking for are mission agents. You can find them with the Agency I believe.
---
Sounds mostly like backdooring people's chains
---
**CCP:** People are mining too much, how do we fix that?
---
*Nerf Rorquals again*
---
*Make mining more dangerous*
---
**----&gt;** *Greatly reduce the respawn rate of ore anomalies*
---
let me introduce you to the (BBB) Branch Botting Bois.
---
well yeah but then they might lose something and gosh then what's the point of even fighting
---
The reason that Sort Dragon kicked SLYCE is so obvious, GOTG will beat Imperium finally.
---
What a great plan.
---
Sounds like you guys are a fun bunch. If you show up in our space I'm sure the sharks will circle, but if our gang finds you first we'll have a good fight.
---
I guess i can't remember how those are supposed to look in handwriting.
---

---
No native english speaker.
---
Branch bellies up to the bar.
---
I'm all for this shit. Not everyone in test is a krab-obsessed bot aspirant.
---
This is how I got into EVE back in 2011-2012. Joined a random corp, made some good friends, had a lot of fun. People went their separate ways and haven't played much since 2013. People keep ya grounded!
---
There used to be something called an agent finder that made locating mission agents very easy. 
---
If I recall dotlan actually allows you to search for mission agents.
---
Something that I've been following close are the ISK faucets
---
Compared to the previous month. 14 Trillion ISK less from NPC bounties came into the game.
---
Now simply comparing to the previous month does not tell much. But we can take a look at few months at least.
---
* January 2019    - 83 Trillion
---
* February 2019  - 69 Trillion
---
* March 2019      - 71 Trillion
---
* April 2019        - 57 Trillion
---
Now, much conclusions based on 4 months can't be made, but if this does mean that CCP's methods of reducing the flow of ISK into the game is working, and if it does not mean that less players are out there ratting, then nicely done.
---
CCP  : AoE doomsday is OP lets remove it and give Titans a single target anti-capital DD
---
CCP : Lol joke, you can have your erase subcap fleet button back.
---
Goodness, Branch is starting to be a contender. A contender for what, you might ask? That is an exercise left to the reader, naturally.

The botting in branch is out of control
---
A large injector is currently 1 bil in jita. They give you a measly 500k skillpoints, ***if*** you have below 5 million that is, the majority of characters get 400k. Please show me the new players that can afford to drop several billion in injectors to "catch up". The daily alpha injector serves the purpose of giving new players an affordable boost in SP if they need it, so why have the other ones? The only "benefit" of the other skill injectors is giving the already loaded people an option with which they can massively expand their personal fleets of rorquals and capitals. Something which would have taken years before now takes about 40 or 50 billion, which is not a lot for people that have been playing this game for upwards of 12 years.
---
Im so glad CCP is paying attention to their game

To be fair, a single 1B T3 makes us isk efficient even if we lose 12 Cyclones, they are absurdly cheap.

I think you are missing "IF" there. Because i do think it means less players ratting. But that one would be on CCP to judge.
---
And much more bots in Branch, ofc.

Dear CCP Rise

The career agents exist to give you starting gear. They are your initial source of capital in this game. Just as above Dotlan is an excellent source for agents. If you dock up in a station that doesn’t belong to a newbie Corp, it will most likely have agents that will give you missions

You're looking for Security agents, check the agency window.

Sounds similar to me when I started - had no idea what I was doing, quickly got bored.  Came back on a whim and found a great group, and then no looking back for 13 years.  
---
People are really what makes EVE, I'm glad to hear that you found ~your people~
---
I wonder if the total ratting bounties shown include or exclude the massive ban-wave that hit a bit ago?
---
Hey /u/Jestertrek you're about to get blown up by people who's remind me bots are going off. What's the hot news?
---
CCP fails to see that changes they made only made most powerful block stronger.
---
Rorq nerfs made getting stronger harder for smaller groups. Anomaly changes didn't affect moon mining, which is tied with advanced industry. 
---
This allows rich to get even richer. People  stockpile ships, modules and ore which they won't even use outside their home region. There is not enough destruction, and null is getting stale. New cyno jammer mechanics made it even worse.
---
Don't forget blood demons they have Ishtar bots in almost every system in branch
---
Hooray more DOA content
---
Whoops. Thanks for pointing it out. Typo fixed.
---
What is this? Not an EVE player but I like to check in from time to time
---
&gt;m to be suggesting they just let instanced pvp be broken and non-dynamic. If that is the case, why bother having it in the first place?
---
I mean, the way it is now basically 2/3rds of interactions end in neither side being able to break the other, so someone gets bribed to die so that both people don't die. 
---
This is clearly a neat mechanic, on paper, that just did not pan out. So yes... delete it.
---
Yeah CCP fucked up with their citadel system, having no limit on how many structure you can have in one system is creating more and more problems for the health of the game...
---
Basically, a bunch of really bored dudes got together and put up 53 player-owned structures around a planet.

&gt; *literally dozens of other healthy gaming communities that don't rely on forced time spent* 
---
Most or all of the games today have some form of grind. There's almost no game out there where every aspect of it is accessible to the player right from the start. And most of these games require you to focus your attention on getting what you want to get and don't let you do something else in the meantime. I would say that EVE is *better* in that regard because you a) don't have to play something specific to be able to do something else and b) because you don't even have to ***play*** something you don't want to until you can do what you want to.
---
The problem you seem to be getting at is the ***amount*** of time you have to wait for certain things. However, that time is absolutely justified when you think about the things that take this long. The only things you really have to train months for are super specialized roles like links or capitals. And while it can be argued that links and maybe logi should be shorter trains, capitals are in a very good spot with about a year of dedicated training necessary to fly one. They are the endgame after all. Getting the best equipment in other MMO's often takes as long.
---
And now for the economic instability. While it can not definitely be said that skill injectors take the blame, they definitely weren't uninvolved in the Mineral Price's deep dive since their introduction in 2016.  Inflation has also slightly accelerated since 2016, although that also may be due to alpha clones.  
---
The more significant change they brought was of strategic nature. Where PL and similar old guard had build up their supercapital fleets over years, the Imperium conjured a large part of its fleet out of nothing over a laughably short timespan. Remember, they built the ***same*** supercapital fleet as ***the entire rest of the game*** had in ***16 years, in less than 3 years.*** Remembering that an injector is about 1 bil, it takes you as little as 50 hours with some activities to make enough to inject into a capital. Even less for people who are only dependent on markets and have almost infinite income potential (i.e. traders and industrialists).

It is just a logical thing, that in a Farms&amp;Fields-Game that EVE is since Lifeblood at least, you win the game with farming (krabbing). 
---
So Sort just adapted to what CCP gave us even harder than DeadCo already did before ... In that Meta taxing Bots is the way to go ...
---
and the problem is going to get so bad that Goons are going to set up  and defend some bluetral alliances in a nearby region to farm them for content, maybe they could call it Querious Fight Club?
---
TAPI are no better either.
---
Human nature is killing the game, simple as. There is always a certain kind of player that will try to join the best or  biggest blocs, and these alliances will focus on developing a unique culture in order to prevent people from leaving. I don't think this is a problem that can be fixed by CCP.
---
Additionally, moon mining is actually more accessible to small groups now as it forces people to actually collect their income rather than just get passive r64 isk. It only takes one person to be willing to take the plunge and begin advanced industry to set up a production chain of t2 modules that can fuel a small-scale alliance in the middle of bumfuck nowhere. Industry income is multiplicative at scale, so supplying a small null alliance is probably the best isk you can get outside of running a SP farm or multiboxing rorqs.

---
None of the options under "activities" include (large scale) fleet pvp (fleets with more than 50 or so subcaps), even though those are the most common format for PvP in most of nullsec, and the primary attractor to the game for a lot of people.
---
The Mining Barges and Exhumers do a wonderful job, make sure you get the boost somewhere though.
---
So you can ponder some more about paper application after complaining so much about mentioning paper dps numbers? I could post as many fits as you want, it wont make you see the performance of the ship when actually using it. I used both the NM and the Rattle before and quite frankly they need about the same time to kill stuff with their primary weapon systems, the rattlesnake has the advantage of drones that also hit like a truck though. And that same time estimation only applies when its against npc's with an EM/Therm hole.

There are 'quests' in eve, but they are kind of old and repetitive (look at the Agency tab) 
---
You can do them for a variety of reasons. Do missions for Caldari Navy if you don't have any preference because you will get lower tax in Jita 4-4 (biggest trading hub in the game) and you can buy LP rewards straight to the station. You can also do L4 security missions for the Sisters of Eve, they give the best isk/LP for your time.
---
you get these mission types:
---
* Distribution (fly from station to station, very boring, low income, low SP requirement. The only reason I would ever do these is if I was half-watching Netflix or otherwise preoccupied. This is an activity you can do basically AFK)
---
* Security (Shoot dumb NPCs and exploit their AI for victory, scaling skill requirements from L1 (can do with less than a day of training) to L4 (reasonably competent battleship/battlecruiser skills) to L5 (capital ships or a medium-sized group required)
---
* Mining (Mining)
---
Here is a useful page: https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Missions
---
You can also do similar missions in NPC Nullsec for better rewards, but established groups live there and it is kind of dangerous if you aren't part of one of those groups.
---
**please don't get stuck in the trap of doing nothing but these**, the game has so much more to offer than just running L4 security missions until you quit of boredom. 
---
**Join a corp. Join a corp. Join a corp.** Unless you're the kind of person who is satisfied playing this game completely alone (you weirdo) you will want to join a corp.
---
Not to be pedantic, but a connected graph is one where some path exists between any two nodes, not necessarily a direct one. So A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D -&gt; A is a connected graph, even though A and C are not directly connected. Conversely, A -&gt; B, C -&gt; D would not be a connected graph, since there's no way to get from A to C. TSP is by assumption only considered for connected graphs, otherwise there is trivially no solution. 
---
But you are right in that OP is essentially just brute-forcing the TSP, modeled such that the path length between systems X and Y is the number of jumps in the shortest route from X to Y.

---
WiS when?
---
gotcha. Ty Joseph
---
What was the inciting incident that led CCP down the path to where it is today?
---
Could that have been handled differently?
---
How common was it among all CSM members to leak some beneficial information to their alliance?
---
Also if no information was leaked how would you try to lead your alliance to make beneficial decisions based on information you learned on the CSM?
---
What's your biggest regret?
---
How much influence do the nullsec blocks *really* have in the CSM?
---
Are CSM suggestions take seriously by CCP, in your opinion, or is it a case-by-case basis depending on what earns the company more money through [insert game mechanic here]?
---
This is a pretty clever way of simplifying the process - you could construct the graph such that each node is either a system that isn't an entrance to a dead-end pocket, or a dead-end pocket as a whole - run whatever TSP algorithm you like on such a graph. Then for each node that represented a dead-end pocket, recursively run the same algorithm. Add up all the results.

&gt;Rifts

&gt;Rifts of different sizes have been detected in Invasion systems. Triglavian fleets have been observed roaming from these anomalies and mineralogical scans of the areas around these rifts have discovered unknown Ore families. Concord asks Capsuleers to put a stop to the influx of Triglavian ships at these locations and seal the rifts where possible.
---
&gt;World Ark
---
&gt;A massive spike in ternary radiation has been detected in the core system of the Invasion. Concord asks Capsuleers to investigate – be advised, pronounced gravimetric signatures in the area indicate a large conglomeration of Triglavian vessels and anomalous structures. As such, Concord suggests forming a sizeable counter-force that should be prepared to operate in unpredictable combat scenarios.
---
&gt;Fleets
---
&gt;Scout: Concord observatories have detected small fleets, classed as Scouts, scanning objects of interest throughout Invasion systems. Though not considered as a major threat, Concord advises Capsuleers to be prepared to face mixed combat tactics and to be prepared for reinforcements and light logistical support. They also advise Capsuleers to consider bringing reinforcements of their own for added security
---
&gt;Vanguard: Concord observatories have detected moderately sized fleets in Core and Neighbourhood systems, classed as Vanguard, disrupting Capsuleer activity in Invasion systems. Concord considers the threat of these fleets greater than Scout fleets and advises advise Capsuleers to operate as a group in order to deal with this scale of fleet. Be prepared for mixed combat tactics and reinforcements with moderate logistical support.
---
&gt;Assault: Concord observatories have detected large fleets in the Core Invasion system, classed as Assault, disrupting Capsuleer activity system-wide. Concord considers these fleets to be of the highest threat level and strongly advise Capsuleers to operate as a group in order to deal with this threat. Be prepared for mixed combat tactics and reinforcements, significant logistical support and disruption.

---
lol why anti being downvoted for suggesting that damage focused ships that take 5 minutes to out damage an already existing, cheaper ship should be improved in some way
---
I live in Jita
---
What do you believe is the biggest impediment to the success of Eve?
---
How much longer do you think Eve will be around?
---
can has making doing within, they not thinking has. Didnt even has make
---
he texted me "yur goin down stuped hed"
---
Its already strong for what It aim to do.
---
Does the CSM use insider knowledge to better position themselves and/or their alliance in-game?  If so, which CSM member or group does this the most?
---
This is actually a legit question.
---
What really happened with ingame treaties? Was it really something that Greyscale just didn't want to do so he scarped it or were there technical difficulties?
---
What is your favourite ship to fly and why is it your favourite ship to fly?
---
idk what CCP expects when you have to show for 50ish 30minute+ timers to take any system, and you cant even drop a dread on them.
---
Makes it easy to distribute stuff though, put everything going to a specific person/location in each container, label them as such and just drop the entire container off.
---
spend 5 minutes straight bring worse than a drekavac?
---
Well if you like playing now you should join VINDI! We are the hottest new alliance in EVE and we are crushing it out in Detorid and other parts. This alliance has everything for all players so looks us up. We've got there best leadership you seen with Mavrick Jeffrey and Lexo Mexo  then we had Matt O'Hearn (El Jefe) and Darvo two of the best FC's going. We always looking to add good pilots so check our our KB.  **Über** active EUTZ and some good USTZ numbers too. If you are USTZ ask for Rhaeghar from Federation, dude is a winner!
---
If only there was a UI that shoed agents by corps and was easy to use. Oh we had that and CCP killed it. Miss the Agency Locater.
---
For me EVE right now seems like something CCP has not really intended. Can you tell us when you were part of CSM how controlling was CCP over EVE universe and how much time ahead were they planning ideas and projects? Thank you!
---
and more potato
---
yesssss
---
Not every corp does pvp, so that wouldn't work.
---
Simply making all adds expire after 3 months would work.  If your corp is still active, make another add (a "copy previous ad" feature would be nice for that.
---
Drones are used for primary stuff aswell, something a Nightmare can't do. And believe it or not, the Raven is a great mission ship, allthough the Navy issue clearly outperforms it.  
---
&gt;Hows your NM fitted, with drone damage mods and omnis?
---
Weird fitting preferences you got there m8.  
---
If you want fittings id suggest you consult zkill, i don't really see why i should put effort into giving you one when you're just trying to bait to get something which you can nitpick without having ever used the ship.
---
What information has CCP feed the players that you knew to not be true?
---
Are you mad?
---
Did you learn what CCP/Hilmar REALLY thought of the summer of Rage?
---
I would be perfectly happy to have another enemy on the border. Smells like fights.
---
Yes, this was common practice before DSTs existed, when you pillocked around in an Iteron V.  Since DSTs have 50,000m3 fleet hanger, I've not used this trick.
---
Not in supers and Titans. The pl side outnumbered legacy. And that is the number that mattered in that fight. Once the goon armor fleet arrived then things changed.
---
Seconded
---
What, in your opinion, was the stupidest change (assuming there were any) CCP suggested implementing during CSM8?
---
o7 when I started most of your blog was becoming obsolete but it was helpful. Thank you for the time you dedicated to the community. Good luck winning eve.
---
What kind of meta do you think CCP has been *actively* encouraging, now that youve had a look on the inside? Was it in line with your own vision?
---
use a cargo scanner...
---
Yes, and t wrecks.
---
And to follow up this excellent question, what's the second thing you've been dying to tell everyone?
---
U gay 2?
---
Probably a ban is my guess.
---
&gt;And believe it or not, the Raven is a great mission ship
---
That explains a lot. Right well, you keep doing you.
---
Honestly I still strongly feel the biggest issue for rorqs is limiting numbers of them. 5 rorqs per system with active cores max and limit anomaly respawns. Increase respawn timer based on how fast/regularly anoms are mined out.
---
Sure sounds like it, meaning we might hear something juicy. The anticipation is killing me.
---
Was there any changes suggested for the betterment of the game, but ultimately not done to favor certain coalitions/alliances?
---
Industry core also doubles as a cyno inhib 
---
New response fleet meta of fast small shit and picket ships, new attacker mrtta as well
---
This is a bad idea when you take sov warfare into context but it sounds fun
---
10 months ago you posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8w3v8k/do_you_miss_the_old_days/e1tih3c/):
---
&gt;We're just past the five year anniversary of CCP Arrow assuring me to my face (and to the rest of CSM8), repeatedly, that despite the fact that "iteration" is a dirty word at CCP, the grey icons were just a first version and they would be iterated on.
---
I feel that this has and is still happening over and over again: New feature, promise of iteration, then nothing for a year or two until a small change happens, which is usually too little, and always too late. Rinse&amp;Repeat.
---
Do you have any insights or theories why this has and still keeps happening?
---
can i have your stuff?
---
This so much. I was preaching this from the moment abyssal PvP was announced. If people aren't pvping in the sandbox then CCP needs to address that problem, and not bandaid it with Eve arena.
---
Lol watch it bug out and spawn both in the same constellations.
---
Traditionally when an MMO is about to close their servers for the last time there is an ending event that is usually off the wall that the GM's make. If you were in control of how Eve ended, what would the event look like?
---
Thanks, edited the main to link there. Now we must wait for answers.... the waiting never ends.
---
Actually getting to Delve is the hardest part.  There are smartbombing and/or instalock gate campers in Aridia and Fountain.  They prey on interceptor taxis.  You can usually get through Aridia in a cloaky/null/nano T3 cruiser or recon no problem though.  Then there is usually a camper 1-2 jumps into Delve who likes to drag bubble you with a dictor, but he's avoidable with interdiction null.
---
There are two "safer" ways to get to Delve:  Find a lucky wormhole (expect the exit in Delve to be camped, and don't expect the wormhole to stay open for long), OR go through Providence and then Catch and then Querious, which is especially good if you're not KoS to CVA.
---
Once you're there, you can set up in NPC stations like some others have mentioned.  If you decide to live there, you can get Black Frog to jump freight some stuff out there for you for a few hundred mil.
---
Which proposed feature are you most surprised that it hasn't been implemented yet?
---
To what degree did you feel that the employees were being hampered or supported by management? It’s often been talked about in vague terms that xyz feature or idea gets lost to time, resource constraints due to management shifting focus.
---
What was the real impact or future impact that Pearl abyss will have on the game in terms of microtransactions or possible usage of the creative minds which in return would mean lower quality updates?
---
What game(s) have come closest to Eve for you?
---
All hype for this event has been lost. Teased as "universe changing" like we've never seen before, and ends up just being a shitty reskinned Sansha incursion (but with mining, oh wow golly gee!)
---
Fucking dumb
---
Designed to attack frigates, but can also kill haulers.
---
It can kill an Astero easily enough. Never had the chance to take on a destroyer. A cruiser would probably have too much tank.
---
The idea is to destroy a target before they have a chance fight back or call for help due to it having approx 1,600 EHP and 0% resists accross the board. With overloaded launchers it can do over 700 DPS.
---
Anything that can tank the DPS and fire a few shots back is likely to win.
---
I'll be making 1-2 EVE Online themed MTG cards each week and posting them here.
---
Question 1: Why are you winning EVE? :(
---
Question 2: To anyone who might be interested in running for CSM. What would be the best things to keep in mind, pro's/con's of membership in it etc.
---
Question 3: Is there anything in particular you'd like to share with us that hasn't been asked?
---
4: I hope you enjoy winning EVE. We'll always be here if you want to return :)
---
Your response certainly does too. Keep playing the game in EFT while i save myself time actually winning it.
---
When would you say Eve went from continuously being "dying", to *actually* dying, and why was that when the Rorqual changes hit?
---
What was a defining moment that made you give up on CCP during your csm time?
---
On a personal note, are there any implementations/improvements to Eve and it's systems that you would spearhead if you were in a position to do so?  
---
Are they any current plans you would shelf that you think we're spending too much time and resources on?  
---
And lastly, How do you like your eggs cooked?
---
Thanks!
---
god
---
What is your thoughts on EVEs future? Do you think CCP is able to not turn this into a a BDO cash shop?
---
Scanning is for the autistic and smartest among us. You have to enjoy it and the challenge of mentally trying to beat the last challenge of scanning in a specific amount of time. In other words, it's fucking fun.
---
Do they still drop from kills 100% of the time or did ccp change that? I remember many years back loving haulers that did that because all the cans would end up in space next to the wreck with 100% of the loot still in it.
---
Protip for new haulers: Don't Haul
---
It's illegal to fit anything except HAMs to your pvp Drake.
---
Don't get pulled over by a police comet, check you Drake fit today.
---
There is nothing hasty about us deploying anything. We're basically space hobbits trying to leave the Shire.
---
Was CCP already headed down the road it is on now, or was the fork in the road after your time of service?
---
Since you are winning eve, please send some of your winnings to my alts.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Ok, real question: What was or is in your opinion the biggest lie CCP told the playerbase?
---
Looks like they're raits, so it wouldn't be that difficult, just immensely tedious. Even if you're doing a few at the same time
---
"Ccpls ban wally"
---
Hurr Durr DPS is the only metric I know Hurr Durr. What do you want 100k EHP 3km/s 4k DPS cruisers? It is not gonna be the go to ship for everything and that is FINE you don't need every new ship to be OP af. And quite honestly if anything the Drek aswell as the Kiki should get nerfed because they are outperforming anything else their size (and some bigger stuff too) by a MILE.
---
GOTB - Guardian's of the bots... Slyce died for this e.t.c...
---
&gt;e is like a untouchable machine..... everyone needs to ban together and change that. Time for a really big wa

Hello, 
---
A) which colleges did the interns attend?
---
B) Was there a certain type? Blonde? Brunette? Bald?
---
C) Which drugs were most prevalent? Adderal? Ritalin? Little blue pills?
---
D) which execs/players overcompensated for having small penis or being short?
---
E) Whom did you miss?
---
"dying" to "actually dying" is the same state with an extra, meaningless word.
---
What happened to the epic trailers, why did they stop
---
I thought it was funny...
---
The dino should be swiming on the edge of a waterfall. Only few inches of eviction, and miss a supercap umbrela.
---
10/10 hope to see more
---
I didn't know Eve ran on Windows 95
---
They are still living in I think a C2 with a C2/NS static.
---
Do you expect to be winning Eve after today because you're bored and leaving or because you expect a punitive ban for this?
---
Nice, I like it!
---
A friend has finally convinced me to try to learn MTG by playing the MTG Arena game, so I'm totally on board with this, some of the art work on the cards is just fantastic.
---
You know it might make a cool band name
---
One of them was in quotation marks, implying anything from hyperbole through irony. The latter was not, implying straightforwards meaning.
---
I remember this trick from my hisec mining days, but I swore I heard it was patched out and I just never thought to try it again now that I have a need to move volume again. Thanks for letting me know I'm just a dumb.
---
&gt;it's fairly unlikely I'll have anything to say about EVE in the future.
---
Do you promise?
---
Why? Who said we wanted to see this?  
---
It's not funny, or even propaganda really?
---
And yet, the game is still going.
---
Is war a bad thing?

"give us fuel to form another reee squad please! Tell us how they intentionally tried to upset us! COME ON!!!! FUCKKKK CCPP ARRRGGGGGGG!!"

/S
---
so much cancer, also it gives you a ceiling individual cargo size   
---
more useful on blockade runners where you only need to deal with 3 and the extra 2400 m3 is handy
---
In your opinion, is the time you personally and all the people involved invested and continue to invest into the CSM worth it?
---
You got anything interesting to tell us or what?
---
All of them?
---
You can *probably* also reduce pipes to a single node. You're either going to travel the length of a pipe, or you're not.
---
The really complex bit is open junction systems. But those aren't as common as you might think.
---
Love me a good small gang Drake - heavy missiles, double webs, missile guidance, long point, MJD and prop mod, couple of ballistics in the bottom and either a nano or a damage control. Paper tank but it shreds any scram tackle that can get close.  
---
Swap out MJD for a shield tank mod if you want to brawl a bit more.
---
If EvE was really what you would have wanted it to be, would you still be playing today?
---
Thank you for everything, Jester. You've been a massive plus to New Eden whilst you were still there. Fly safe regardless of where the ship may take you o7
---
If you can't be pirate in lowsec, why do you get reduced security status when you're busy pirating, and get treated like a criminal by CONCORD in highsec?
---
U suck
---
Was there a particular player organisation that CCP looked to frequently, when contemplating potential changes to the game? 
---
If yes, who were they? 
---
An analogy here would be "elite" customer(s) for typical SMB.
---
OK, Dominion trailer story time. First thing: this story was pieced together by talking to several devs that were involved in this trailer in various aspects, some of whom might have had ulterior motives in telling me the story (given that lots of devs were laid off soon after this and might have been angry about it). So with that said, everything in this story has been confirmed by at least two sources that told me the same version of events but there still may be inaccuracies here and there. Any inaccuracies in this story, I take responsibility for as the chronicler of this story.
---
Before reading this story, if you're not familiar with them first watch the [Dominion trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDVEHE10nHc), then watch the [Future Vision trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45mlVuLs_Nw). Familiarity with the [Apocrypha trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q62Wk3xWH8g) will also be useful.
---
After the release of Apocrypha, both the devs as a group and the EVE video team were really unhappy with how the Apocrypha trailer turned out. The groups agitated for a much more dramatic, cinematic trailer for the next release and pushed hard for something much bigger. They fought for (and got) a much bigger budget, one where the EVE Community team, the video production team, and the devs working on the Dominion expansion would work together to build a long theatrical trailer.
---
Multiple drafts went around (one dev and only one dev told me a remarkable story about who wrote one of the drafts, but I'm 100% sure he's reading this and he can tell that bit of the story if he wants) and there's some argument among the devs I talked to who actually wrote the final script. But the general gist of what the trailer would be like was worked up pretty quick and a script for a **five minute long** trailer was developed (note that the final trailer was 3:45).
---
After long, hard work, the five minute trailer was developed, put together, voice acted, and a final draft readied for presentation to Hilmar and other members of CCP management. Again, I have what happened next from two people who were in the room: management generally, and Hilmar specifically **didn't get it at all**. He didn't understand who the players were, he didn't understand what they were fighting over, and he was particularly perplexed as to why a third party would show up to disrupt a fight between the two sides. He was asking questions like "Why are they [the Russians] getting involved? There's no reason for them to be involved." and saying the whole thing was confusing. The other senior managers in the room backed Hilmar up.
---
In addition, the managers **hated** the fact that undeveloped features (planned for the two follow-on EVE expansions, the next one which was to be called Covenant) were included in the trailer. There was no enthusiasm in the room for showing long-term plans.
---
Hilmar was sure that players wouldn't get it, ordered the whole Russian section and the sections with future planned features out of the trailer, and gave the video production guys marching orders to make the whole thing shorter and simpler. Those orders apparently held until the next morning when someone (the people I talked to didn't know who) talked Hilmar off the ledge, told him there wasn't enough time to do any more major changes, and new instructions came down to just remove more minor stuff and the features that wouldn't actually be in Dominion. Still, one not-in-Dominion feature slipped through: outpost destruction, shown when the titans at the end of the trailer actually shoot at the outpost.
---
The general sense that was communicated to the video production guys from their management by way of senior management was that "This is going to be another failed trailer, nobody's going to understand this, but it's too late to make any major changes so we'll just have to go with it." So while the video production guys and the devs they showed it to loved it, their morale was still in the tank... until the players saw the trailer.
---
After that point, management completely reversed themselves and trailers that showed potential new features in EVE such as Future Vision before they were released was suddenly OK for some reason...
---
So, there you go: the original Dominion trailer was five minutes long, and on a hard drive in CCP somewhere there exists an additional minute plus of completed trailer footage showing features from two alternate universe future releases of EVE that may or may not have ever happened...
---
Regrading chronicles and lore, did you observe any focus from the teams on progressing or rejuvenation of the world building / narratives? 
---
Or is it an aspect that's now viewed as part of an expansion/ general project, rather than the foundation of the game itself?
---
I love how JoeCuster just assumes it's a bot because he could actually kill it lol
---
You finally found your niche. XD
---
His last one was quite endorsed by the people who frequent this sub.
---
Its always said "if only CCP Devs would play their game...", so tell us if you know, at least while you were CSM, did the Devs actually play the game on any level above "filthy casual"?
---
Baskin-Robbins Peanut Butter and Chocolate. By a long way.
---
I suspect there's about a 50% I get banned for this, yeah. I accept that CCP can ban people for any reason whatsoever. If I'm not banned, though... I'm done with EVE as it exists today. Even CCP Falcon himself admits that [EVE itself sometimes kills play styles](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9ld88j/old_school_eve_server_please/e75vqyf/?context=2). That's what's happened to me.
---
it has worse ehp than drekavac with similar tank price lol what is your deal
---
obviously dreks and kikis should be nerfed but as it stands the iki is no better than a drek
---
I like it, and I'll give it a try. Mad props for creating stuff to help this game along =)  
---
Had a look at it and pretty much does what it says, which is more then good enough for me.   
---
Would a link to EveWho maybe improve the site as well?
---
The EVE Collector's Edition was supposed to include a CD, and on this CD would have been the original beta build of EVE Online circa 2003, which people could load and play in single player on their own PCs.
---
CSM 8 was told this was almost certainly going to happen, and then suddenly everyone stopped talking about it and we were never told why.
---

---
Why do I feel like this can draw a parallel to content generation in game and CCPs view of it so easily..........
---
On one hand, it's a perfect rakdos card. On the other hand: it's an emblem effect that mkes you more vulnerable to sweepers in colors with lots of x/1s that it kills and is a 4 mana enchantment in a format with mortify.
---
thank you. i never knew. His apparent glee at CCPs mis-steps made me smile. I hope the game endures despite CCP. otherwise i have been playing years of Skill Queue Online for nothing.
---
....we need the full trailer
---
Er I legalised botting in the drone regions
---
Nope. One night, CSM8 and CPM0 sat around as a group and speculated about it. The best story we could come up with was the "5" referred to the number of races of humanity (Jove, Amarr, Gallente, Caldari, Minmatar) and the "14" referred to the number of bloodlines.
---
But anything definitive? Nope, we weren't told a word about it.
---
The thing about DUST that we were told (by Hilmar and by a couple of other devs) was that *far* more work and effort went into the interconnections between EVE and DUST than were ever actually implemented. In particular, we were told in one session that the visible parts of DUST 514 and the dev time that was spent on them (ie, the shooter game play) were tiny and insignificant compared to the vast amount of money and time that were spent building the underpinnings between DUST and EVE.
---
We were shown *remarkable* things that apparently would have been easily capable of the interconnection in a relatively short time period. In particular, we were told that the code capability of a DUST 514 mission to take over a supercarrier *while it was involved in a capital ship battle* and to turn ownership of the ship to the winning side in the DUST 514 battle was not only possible, it was something that could be implemented in a relatively short period (18 months).
---
That makes me sad.
---
Depends how many accounts you are running and if you have a rorqual near you to compress in. The more accounts you are running and less time you want to move ore for a game of mini-tetris. If you can compress, I'd say Covetor/Hulk for less than 4, for more than 4 you swap to a Skiff or Mackinaw. I personally swapped from running 6 rorquals to 1 max boost rorq + 8 Mackinaws and can pretty much get right off grid without feeling like I have 60-70b locked in place for 5 minutes.
---
Always honour!
---
Why the fuck do people care so much about trailers jfc
---
the third party thing is dumb but from a business perspective he’s probably right about not showing undeveloped features due to a long history of them never actually being developed, see also: your literal example of the one thing that snuck through
---
Holy shit . . . . that would be amazing. I would pay so much money for that.
---
Without a basis of comparison, I'm not sure I can say.
---
I *can* say that Seagull trusted us to submit long-range proposals for future gameplay development and showed us her planned road map of EVE development for 2014 through 2017. I'm pretty sure that future CSMs weren't trusted to that level.
---
Thanks very much!
---
Probably programmed to accept convos and will then type some bullshit.
---
Aye that’s what I was thinking. Dumbasses.
---
Dying and dead aren't the same.
---
We need the CSM to raise cyno jammers as a concern to CCP. They are too effective at protecting sov and preventing ship destruction.
---
We need to see the unredacted trailer.
---
What is Detorid and why is it getting so much destruction? Nearly as much as Jita.
---
\#FreeTheUncensoredTrailer !
---
Hilmar only started playing EVE again last year. He's about as disconnected from what actually matters to EVE as he could possibly get.
---
&gt; In particular, we were told that the code capability of a DUST 514 mission to take over a supercarrier while it was involved in a capital ship battle and to turn ownership of the ship to the winning side in the DUST 514 battle was not only possible, it was something that could be implemented in a relatively short period (18 months).
---
God damn, I always wondered why we didn't have that. Talk about an interesting way to address super/titan spam and relieve how boring tidi fights can be.
---
I hope CCP revisits this idea, even without a broader FPS game. It would be game changing.

Idk the fleets sound like there gonna be roaming and rifts being sights them self's.

Scouts sound kinda like there acting like Drifters seeker's rest seem like different levels off fleets.
---
As much as I would love to have less blues, I understand the leadership of TEST. You have to adopt goon meta to hold sov. You have to have lots of Rorqs to fuel the industry and to have ability to quickly replace any loses. You have to to have your own allies that would help you, because enemy will surely have batphone everyone they can.
---
Big blocks can mine even shitty moons for normal ore if the anomalies wouldn't spawn fast enough. They have means to mitigate the nerf. They already have infrastructure in place, and they have means to protect their miners. I know that rorq die more often now, but in well protected areas they only die if they make a mistake, or there are other disadvantageus factors at play, like pilot DC'ing during the tackle, server isues and such.
---
Three things come to mind:
---
1. I was very big into Localization and the discussions around it. I pushed pretty hard with CCP management -- any CCP management that I could get my hands on -- to do a more Wikimedia style localization of the EVE client. This would involve replacing the text in EVE's code with localization pointers to language files that would actually have all the text. At one point, I joked to David Reid (then CCP's Chief of Marketing) that this could be used to translate EVE into Klingon. CCP *kinda* ended up taking this one seriously for a while and actually put together a summit session to talk about community-developed Localization. But then a bunch of the team got laid off.
---
2. I pushed hard for completely changing EVE's login/account schema. I pushed for what I called a "WXYZ" structure for EVE accounts: one player could have "W" character slots, "X" of which are being used, "Y" of which can train concurrently, and "Z" of which could be logged in concurrently. To that, I suggested adding barriers that would allow players to segregate some accounts as being on a separate API for downloading of character information. So instead of EVE's ridiculous nature of multiple accounts, you'd have one account and buy (say) 15 character slots, you might have 11 of them in use, five of which might be training, and three of which you could log in concurrently. Then you could separate a bloc of those into a fake separate account which you could use for spying/meta activities. It was probably a bigger change than anyone in CCP was ready to make.
---
3. Before SKINs were released, I made a pest of myself with the art team trying to push for "paint pots" similar to what existed in a lot of other MMOs and multiplayer shooters at the time, and places on the ships for corporate and alliance logos.
---
So the CEO is incompetent. We all knew that. 😑
---
First time flying a Hyena. Was a lot of fun but it took me a while to realise that once webbed most people will 180 and fly straight back toward their gang which means I have to fly into dangerous positions, especially with unheated t2 web range being only 30km. I spend most of this video being scared of the Orthrus but I needn't have been as ECM god Glasi Vookto was on field keeping us all safe with his mighty Griffin.
---
\+1 , this dude is a jerk.
---
Lots of people have said a lot of things about Dr.Eyjo who was EVE's chief economist when I was on the CSM. I heard every opinion of the man possible when I was on the CSM, from "he's useless and never comes into the office unless a reporter or the CSM is in the building" to "he's critical to helping us balance the economy."

One thing is for sure, though: when he left, the devs stopped caring about the economy almost completely from a development standpoint. Today, they pay lip service to it (sometimes) but the development isn't data driven in the way it was (say) in the lead-up to the moongoo rebalance. As bad as that rebalance was done, at least you can say that the devs looked at the data before they did it. These days, I'm not convinced they look.
---
Why are you looking for something to get angry about?
---
would have a similar outcome, with an alliance mail
---
EVE gained its fame and its player base from being a sand box that welcomed every type of play. That's gone now, and only two types of game play are valued: hard-core PvE and hard-core massive alliance sov battles.
---
I don't know how to do it, but CCP has to get back to EVE welcoming other types of game play and creating a capability for them to take place.
---
Yup, kind of the multitude of games CCP tries to push out coming out of the same broken mold. This will as well.
---
This got caught up in the destruction of the two follow-on expansions to Dominion. I never found out why those two expansions didn't happen, but once those went down, a lot of things went down with them for shorter or longer periods, including both outpost destruction  and treaties.
---
Okay, to extend on this Jester, The story I always heard about Dust 514 was that the 514 was its planned release date, that being may 2014, I guess from what you are suggesting, that story would be a concoction post-release to explain the weird numbering?
---
Correct, that's the nature of NP problems.
---
Yes, pls.
---
I took that screenshot today as your hole's static opened into mine.  I'll take another next time we're neighbours :)
---
Protip: This works with all containers. Extra Capbooster for y'all. I thought this was well known tho.

As long as nothing you haul is over 3900, then this works fine.
---
Funny thing about cans and kills. They roll for each can. So if it survives, all the contents are intact.
---
I'm not looking for anything to get angry about or to hand out pitchforks over. I love this game and have been a staunch advocate/supporter of it since I started playing five years ago, both verbally and fiscally (RIP my IRL wallet lol).
---
I've heard a lot of rumors since I've played Eve about how much more out of touch Eve Management is much than the Eve Devs (most of the time; also substantiated by another one of Jester's answers in this very thread) and I think Jester's answer to my questions can provide some insight there.
---
Also if you look, my question has two parts.  I wanna hear about the ugliest \*but\* also I want to hear about the best/brightest time where CCP saved Eve from the player base collectively committing hara-kiri via REEEEEEEEEEEEE.  There's good and bad to everything in life, and eve is no exception.
---
Unsurprisingly, CCP's detailed ban reports don't agree with you or Rick's narrative. I love the hardcore attempt at spin/blameshifting though. \~RiotRick "How can I spin getting kicked for being a racist/toxic twat who's mad about losing space because I can only form 12 doods with a weeks notice?" "I know! I'll claim I was fighting the bots!" Even Hillary can't spin that hard, he should be proud.
---
We dont orbit at 0 it's actually at 4350
---
This is a really good question. The short answer is that CCP devs as a whole pay a **lot** more attention to perceived experts on the CSM than they do on the general member. Captain Kirk on Star Trek once joked that after the Organian Peace Treaty, the Organians would give a planet to whomever developed it the most efficiently, "and whatever else you can say about the Klingons... they are most efficient!"
---
In the same way, null-sec CSM members tend to be perceived experts in their fields and they're *definitely* efficient about making their desires known to the devs. And since they represent a lot of players, those desires get a broad audience.
---
This desire to only work with experts applies to every CSM dev and the more active the dev, the more they displayed it. Fozzie is notorious for this (or was, when I was on the CSM). At one point, I was making a point about how HACs were used in small-gang battles and how they should be changed, and he wouldn't engage with me on the topic until *after* I'd answered a question: "Well, which HACs do you think are the ones that are most used?" It was kind of infuriating to have these check-points thrown at us. To be fair, I was able to answer to the question to Fozzie's satisfaction and *after* that, he agreed to talk with me about it, but only after that.
---
I saw the same thing happen with the null-sec CSMs, notably mynnna and PGL, both of whom would often have these sorts of questions thrown at them before their positions were taken seriously. Since they were able to do so, they got a serious hearing. Korvin, on the other hand, tended not to get serious hearings both because he couldn't answer these questions and because his ideas tended to be more outlandish and disorganized.
---
It's a 50/50 shot they will drop
---
I'd love to see them fight each other.
---
Who says you can't drop a dread on them?  
---
Long-Range Dreads with a Mino are used pretty commonly for a lot of timers on all sorts of smaller citadels.
---
It is a smaller hull. Also EHP isnt allways the same. Less raw HP but way higher resists is way better for reps. Also it has a smaller sig than a drek and the ADC is just a great module for any kind of PvP.
---
Also I did mention that the drek and kiki are too strong didn't I?
---
Honestly, even if it was a PVE aspect of Dust where supers have another hangar, where they put in "defensive resources" that basically set up the ship for slowing down, or thwarting attackers. Cause if it was suddenly "well, fuck, I'm invaded, there goes my ship" nobody would bring them to fights.
---
Are goony line members even that pumped up for this campaign? There doesn't seem to be that much drum banging on reddit like there was for the last one.
---
It's not a single thing. It's the total disregard that some devs had for player opinion. There were and are some devs that simply don't give a shit that there are players out there and that we maybe know the game.
---
CCP SoniClover was really notorious about this, as were Ytterbuim and Arrow to lesser extents. All of them would come into Summit sessions, drop what they were doing on the table, and pretty much say "take it or leave it". When Arrow was pushed, he'd say "well, we'll iterate on that" or "you'll get used to it". He said *both* about monochrome Neocom icons when those were pushed out, which enraged me and I don't anger easily. He just wasn't interested in an opinion that didn't start and end with "You're a genius."
---
&gt; and to get started in doing some industry work. 
---
If you want ore so you can do Industry work, you might want to consider buying already refined minerals.    
---
TEST space probably has plenty of folks willing to sell it to you, and a lot better rate than you could mine it. 
---
I totally get it if you want to do the fully-independent thing of mining it all yourself, but it's more profitable to have the multi-boxing Rorq players mine the ore for you.
---
Why don't you just fuck off?
---
&gt; If I don't get caught it isn't illegal!

Here is the official discord for EVE-HR. https://discord.gg/XQ39wwP

is it an Icelandic cultural thing, as I've read others say, or is it just ccp specific culture to feel that way?

I've been playing in potato mode since 2009.

Data either supports your narrative or it doesn't. Until data supports it, you're full of shit, and you have an axe to grind. Plain and simple.

"RUSSIAAAA!!!!!!" \~ Hillary 2016-Current
---
As I said to /u/Dran_Arcana, having only been on the CSM once, I don't have the basis for comparison for this.
---
Being outside the room, though, I think it's disturbing how each successive CSM has been more and more in CCP's pocket. The CSM was started partially to be a watchdog. As I joked a couple of weeks ago:
---
@CSM 1, 2008, CCP after T2.0: We are creating this group of player representatives partly to serve an important watchdog function of making sure that EVE developers never again abuse their positions and the trust of our community.
---
@CSM 7, 2011, CCP after Fearless: Our recent mistakes just reinforce the importance of the CSM in providing oversight, feedback, and advice on the standards our player base expects us to achieve and that we will never again abuse our community's trust.
---
@CSM 14, 2019, CCP: We are going to ensure that all CSM members not only sign an NDA and take part in extensive onboarding but conform to a CSM Code of Conduct so that they can never again abuse our trust.
---
I certainly have no interest in joining CSM 14 under those kinds of conditions.
---
I like [Sausage Fennel soup](https://www.nutmegnanny.com/italian-sausage-fennel-white-bean-soup/).
---
why?! doesnt this qualify as low effort using generic meme template without context?
---
&gt; I suspect there's about a 50% I get banned for this, yeah.
---
I reckon if you get banned for talking about CSM activities _after_ the NDA has expired, there's gonna be some serious community outrage. There's no reason you shouldn't be able to talk about this now.
---
If you have a booster with remote reps, a covetor works too
---
Single player offline Eve...
---
My God.
---
Holy fuck so instead of having to maintain credentials for multiple accounts you could tie everything into a single one? and just sub/plex for the custom level of service you wanted?
---
Hell yeah.
---
What about second rorqual? Does he know about second rorqual?
---
&gt; we were never told why
---
Security concerns, I bet.  Put that code out in the wild and there would be no telling what the monkeys would do with it.  However I could guess they would eventually use it to screw with the live game.
---
1. There were six, actually: CCP management simply didn't get the Domination trailer. David Reid was EVE's Executive Producer while they were searching for an EP to replace Jon Lander. Devs used PHPbb as their means of internal communication during CSM8, while pushing the much YAF on players. The EVE Collector's Edition was originally going to come with a 2003 standalone copy of EVE Online. Logi on killmails (CCP Veritas, et al); there's a whole story behind this. And CCP Veritas: "Every alliance worth anything should have a programmer." Veritas was a great guy, but he was completely dismissive of small alliances and felt that every alliance worth anything should have a big full time staff, including what basically amounted to an IT department. I never could convince him that there should be a place for smaller alliances.
---
2. Incarna game play. Seagull had a lot of great ideas in this space that really would have changed up EVE, including stuff like DUSTies taking over supercaps during supercap battles. Maybe her ideas were too radical, I dunno, but they sure sounded awesome to me!
---
3. Putting up campaign threads saying all the things you're going to get CCP to change is not only useless, it's actively counter-productive. CCP employees have their own ideas about how the game is going to be developed. They might ask your opinion. But your chances of getting a particular feature you want implemented is about 2%.
---
Sounds and looks delicious!
---
I mean, Serenity does too, technically.
---
Just came back after a break. Did they change the mission cleansing fire ? I used to blitz it by destroying the cathedral but it does not seem to work anymore.
---
Whichever the case, it's clear this culture still resides within CCP, like them removing the 3-letter search with dashes.
---
Nope, not that I ever heard about.
---
hmm, results in matches for me?! did you have other filter options enabled too?
---
the corps can choose 4 out of 6 options in the "space" category, so choosing low and high class is fine :)
---
Do you think Abyssal Deadspace is a good way to start looking for a solution to this issue?
---
What's the story behind logi on killmails?
---
i'll consider it as an option for future releases!

"Thirded".

Working at a software company, it's a developer thing.  
---

* For others it's simply that they've been beaten down enough with impossible deadlines that they simply have a hard time working with others on something that will inevitable cause more work without extending the deadlines.
---
happy to hear that! :)
---
i'll consider it for future releases!
---
Tbh, with all of the (valid) complaints about Eve dying today, this is the one most overlooked. The economy is the biggest reason Eve was great and it’s beyond fucked. I mostly trade and pvp and can draw direct correlation to every pvp/content problem from a economy source. If someone fixed the economy I bet 90% of other issues would eventually fix themselves. So sad.
---
And even then he's only ever mined in High Sec by all accounts that I have read.
---
...which might explain why there's been a recent focus on protecting miners by changing the war dec mechanics.
---
&gt; Cause if it was suddenly "well, fuck, I'm invaded, there goes my ship" nobody would bring them to fights.
---
You say that like it's a bad thing
---
No question.
---
I just want to say thank you. Thank you for the many many many mornings I was able to get up grab a coffee and enjoy reading your blog. I know it was a huge amount of work and that you took a huge amount of shit from some people, but i highly doubt I am the only one who really appreciated what you put into the community.
---
You absolutly can fight a carrier or 3 in RR cyclones, especially if you're getting null sec "small gang" fleet numbers.
---
16 Clones will tank over 9k with 3 links active, more if they're not shooting EM, more if you T2 the rigs (protip: all clones can fit a T2 link in the utility high). Split those reps into 2 groups and you are almost perma tanking 4.5k. 10+ medium neuts, 9k dps, light drones/ecm drones to defang or neuter fighters.
---
No login issues here. No extension necessary
---
How do you feel about the state of wormholes?
---
I dunno, haulers in Nullsec alliances make bank for very little work.
---
&gt;But your chances of getting a particular feature you want implemented is about 2%.
---
If you were to put together a Guide to Getting Devs' Attention with Your Feature Proposal, what would it look like?
---
Each can is rolled on 50/50 but the contents of each can match the can itself, so you either drop the whole can or the whole can is destroyed.
---
I heard that story too. Like I said, we were never told what the true meaning was.
---
lol rick wishes, he got called out for being a racist fuck and tried to spin the optics of it.
---
Do you honestly think there is a way for CCP to turn the game around and make smaller scale PVP viable again without the big nul blocks pretty much being in charge in just about anything that is going on (at least what is profitable)?
---
&gt;soul-destroying 10% TIDI fights on Keepstars
---
This unfortunately. 
---
Things would probs be more interesting if we built an arena and just made our bots fight each other in a 1 vs 1 championship and then the losing side gives up their space.
---
Fozziesov and TiDi
---
Well imagine it being like invading the Triglav mothership or the Sansa one, that could be cool PvE stuff for CCP’s future shooter.
---
Lots of devs (95% Icelandic) deny this, but 95% of the the non-Icelandic devs told me they were pretty much discriminated against. In particular, I was told lots of stories about Icelanders being promoted over better-qualified non-Icelanders and a lot of conversations being held in Icelandic around non-Icelanders even though management specifically decreed that only English would be spoken at CCP HQ.
---
**That said**, a lot of the devs that told me these stories were laid off, so they might have been bitter. Where the actual truth is, I can't say. CCP internal politics was and is absurdly opaque.
---
Thanks for the (somewhat depressing lol) answer /u/Jestertrek!  
---
What about the second part, did CCP ever save the day in a major way?  Maybe a Dev overrode management; or CCP did something against the wishes of the player base that turned out great?
---
well some other activity in perimeter might have fasttracked that specific issue^^
---
cringe
---
Ah okay. That makes sense.
---
No. Abyssal Deadspace is someone taking Seagull's Space Colonization vision and doing the bits of it that are easy.
---
Hilmar's inability to understand 3rd partying is just one in a closet full of character flaws that have driven CCP into the mud over the past decade.
---
Amen to this! I hope all CSM candidates in this cycle get to read this...
---
When did he leave again? I remember expansive keynotes for 2015 and prior, then not so much for stuff after that like Citadels etc.
---
STOP STEALING
---
it seems like seagull had tons of great ideas, why were they never implemented, or even seriously considered?
---
I spent a lot of time talking to CCP managers, but Hilmar was always kept a little isolated from us. I had to fight Dolan tooth and nail to get CSM 8 one summit session with him. Dolan presented a dozen excuses not to have one, the most egregious of which was "He knows nothing about EVE. All he knows about are budgets."
---
By the time I finally got the session, we were pulled aside (by Dolan and Falcon) and told not to ask him anything *too* adversarial. So we kind of tip-toed with him. I wasn't too unhappy with how the session went and we got to ask him some good questions about CCP marketing and plans.
---
But it would have been nice to get a private session with him and I never did.
---
I mean, they’ve created the greatest game (at least, conceptually) ever, I’d be surprised if there weren’t a couple of people with big heads up at CCP studios.
---
XD Nah, I'm the CEO.
---
During whole E1 shitstorm you were very vocal. 
---
Is there anything you regret looking back?
---
What was CCP's reaction internally to all the Drama?
---
I would just like to add that I totally agreed with your stance.
---
I spoke to E1 several times during the event and it amazed me how he couldn't admit that he was in the wrong and his claims that members of Goonswarm had threatened to release personal information about him if he followed on his threats to release information about them was laughable to say the least
---
Private servers
---
OMG ... exactly that tense situation of 3rd partying from evil russians hidden in the dark was the by far best thing in this trailer that was one of the best trailers overall ... until today 3rd partying a fight is one of the most satisfying PvP situations.
---
Shows just how much out of touch ccp management is towards his players ...
---
I'm sure literally everyone in CCP would happily snap their fingers and change what we have now to a system like that, what he's saying is while everyone probably wants it CCP is not willing to spend the development cost, which would probably be rather significant.
---
&gt;But your chances of getting a particular feature you want implemented is about 2%.  
---
That's honestly a lot more than realistic people here expected i think.
---
Failure to switch away from waterfall-style development.
---
Beta sisi
---
If only you could ram a shuttle to prevent a structure from anchoring
---
They're just like any other gun.
---
Edit
---
With one exception, they have zero falloff so trajectory analysis isn't gonna do squat
---
Do you believe Hilmar knows nothing about EVE?
---
&gt; Putting up campaign threads saying all the things you're going to get CCP to change is not only useless, it's actively counter-productive. CCP employees have their own ideas about how the game is going to be developed. They might ask your opinion. But your chances of getting a particular feature you want implemented is about 2%.
---
I wish this was more widely understood. I've heard this from quite a few ex-CSMers, yet when I was running I kept getting gotcha'd on this, "Yeah but what are you going to push for?". You browse though who's running the last couple years and they all have a bigger manifesto than actual political parties.
---
CCP devs want to work on new and interesting things. It's a bit like science: the glory is in making the original discovery. When someone makes an original discovery in science, someone else is supposed to go back and confirm the findings. It's one of the core tenets of the scientific method.
---
But doing so isn't sexy and doesn't result in grant money.
---
I think the same kind of thinking happens in CCP. Once something's out and working, it's not considered sexy to improve on it, even by the person who champions it. There's also a little bit of player fault around this because the first implementation of their idea is often so bad that nobody uses it and players hoot about how bad it is. That's not a recipe for iteration.
---
The most telling example of this was the in-game Twitch implementation that Rise championed. The first version wasn't that great, but Rise was enthusiastic about it and really wanted to push it forward and asked for CSM 8 support. We gave it to him, in spades. I myself had a long convo with David Reid about ways to market it that night at a dev dinner.
---
But even though Rise loved that feature, it was never iterated upon and was later quietly removed from EVE's code. Why? Because us damned players wouldn't use a quarter-finished feature.
---
ok dude
---
Was it ever a point of discussion how one alliance seemingly knew about the changes to Titans/Supercaps with Dominion and started mass building them a few months before patchnotes ?
---
CSAA spammed in Deadend-Constellations they tried to lock down even for blues from early summer 2009 on (6 months before patch).
---
Why is genenite imports more than the rest of eve put together? What is net imports?
---
This might be a somewhat loaded question so please adapt where needs must but do you feel the devs don't understand their own game? If so, do you think they care about trying to learn or are they more focused on trying to get players playing 'correctly' instead?
---
Also, do you think that the devs have been blinded by massive null battles creating big recruitment drives into focusing on null too much? If so, why have they proceeded to make null safer and yet more rewarding than high sec, essentially eliminating any chance of those battles happening organically again?
---
Never too early to quit

r/evejobs
---
Thanks for sharing, though your answers dishearten me, I had hoped CCP was better at working on EVE than the general consensus but I guess not :/
---
Seagull had (and showed us) a roadmap for EVE development for 2014 through 2017. Unfortunately, it was **far** too aggressive. Seagull badly, badly overestimated the level to which she could motivate her troops.
---
Example: she was pushing for a full Crimewatch-level rewrite of the way players relate to each other: corps, alliances, coalitions, SIGs, treaties, other player groups. A few preliminary designs were shown to us by various dev teams and it was put on the road map to be completed in late 2015. But somewhere along the way it just died.
---
They do
---
You know nothing John Hilmar
---
enjoy the endless structure grind on top of the new cyno jammer mechanics. 
---
sounds really fun and cool and good.
---
Rebuilding how corps, alliances, and coalitions are structured. It is quite literally the underpinning for every single thing in the game. And yet brand new features like Citadels are being built on this absurdly bad mish-mash that dates back 15 years.
---
It's crazy.
---
Join a WH corp and leave dirty K space...
---
In before CCP write a dev post calling this an exploit because, despite bug reports being raised, they didn't realise this was a thing that could be done until it appeared on reddit.
---
Besides Logibro(May he live forever)
---
Was there every anyone in CCP that seemed to give a shit about the AT or the idea of Tournaments in general? Was it ever a point of discussion or was it drowned in other stuff? 
---
Enjoy winning the game. It feels really good once you’re finally out. :)
---
And now the channel mysteriously vanishes, removing all content, and disappearing with the isk, the scam is complete, so my question to the community is this, who if any of you paid her the 5 billion she was asking for and did u get your "private video"?
---
My guess is that this was one of the most elaborate isk scams created thus far, and Im curious how much she actually made in this one day of scamming.
---
Why was she unable to motivate programmers to do their jobs?
---
Money. Everything inside CCP revolves around how much budget this or that department has. CSM 8 was often brought proposals from devs that wanted **us** to push CCP management on their behalf to provide funding for.
---
unlimited ramp until your target die, theres a thread already on why It will broke abyssal proving ground, same apply for any kind of 1v1/ taking down big target.

Thank you!

"try to do something about those scalpels catching reps"   
---
great fcing there

I myself had a long convo with David Reid about ways to market it that night at a dev dinner.
---
That was just a dumb idea though. It hasn't been a success in any game that's implemented it and OBS even years back when this happened was light years ahead of that integration both on functionality and performance. Not to mention the that EVE Online isn't exactly a stream friendly game.
---
Still better than krabbing online
---
At least Delve will be relatively undefended for a while
---
Will you do an NDA-free podcast type interview?  Surely TiS or similar would be a good platform to share your experiences.
---
But goons don't have any BOTs (supposedly)
---
Yes! Absolutely worth it, if it's done properly. When the CSM works properly, it's an amazing resource for both the players and CCP. I told this story a year or so back and it's relevant to your question:
---
----
---
See, this is the thing about being on the CSM that most people don't get. You go to the Summits and sure the devs say a lot of stuff. And about 90% of it is scripted: stuff they've been told to share with the CSM to get their opinion. But every session, one dev gives some off-hand comment that doesn't seem to mean a whole lot... except when you think about it, it probably does. It's something that dev desperately wants to do but CCP management doesn't think it's particularly important.
---
One of my main things when I was on the CSM was I would write down that one off-hand comment per session, grab the dev that said it that evening, ply them with drinks and gifts and an understanding ear and get them talking about it. To use but one example (and I'm sure a certain CCP dev would disagree with me, but fuck him), I'm convinced this is how variable warp speeds came about: CCP Masterplan said something really off-hand about how he'd tried to do it once but couldn't get it to work.
---
So that night at the CSM/dev dinner, I pigeonholed Masterplan into a corner and he and I talked and talked about that one thing. He told me how he'd experimented with it, and couldn't quite get it to work. I gave him lots of reasons why I thought it was really important to get it working. Then I grabbed David Reid, pulled him into the convo, and started talking about how CCP could market it. This was a thing that I really enjoyed doing: grabbing one dev and one manager, putting them together, and getting them to work together on something. And after the Summit was over, I kept nudging them both along in the CSM/dev chat that existed at that time.
---
Through some internal magic of CCP politics that I never figured out, Masterplan and/or Reid managed to get it into the plan such that Masterplan could spend time actually working on it. And before anyone realized it, something that this one dev (fuck him) said was probably impossible was instead working and was a major feature plugged at Fanfest (you may remember the video of the inty warping across a system in a few seconds: that's exactly how I mentioned to Reid that he could get players excited about it).
---
Now, there were certain screw-ups in the implementation of that feature, and do not not NOT get the idea that I'm taking credit for that feature. It was totally Masterplan's idea, mentioned in one of the CSM Summit sessions. All I did was get two people together that together could make that idea happen, and explain to both of them from a player perspective why it was important to make it happen.
---
When the CSM really works, this is how.
---
The "certain CCP dev" in this story is Fozzie, who shat on the idea of variable warp speeds and said it was impossible.
---
CCP not investing in EVE's core concept, the sand box. As pieces and parts of the sandbox are blown up with explosives and bulldozed, the player base just keeps getting smaller.
---
Now this, this is stangry boomerposting  at its finest.
---
The ESS. We told SoniClover it was stupid. Players shown the concept told him it was stupid. After it was in the game, everyone told him it was stupid. He wouldn't relent. Stubbornest CCP dev I dealt with, by far.
---
"Hilmar doesn't know the game ", thanks for confirming this.
---
Interesting, thanks for the response.
---
I really enjoyed your blog, and was very disappointed when you closed it.  It seemed to me that your enthusiasm for the game was just fine until you got onto the CSM, and then something happened that dampened that enthusiasm.  I couldn't help but feel that your look at how the sausage was made changed your view of eating it.  Is this impression at all accurate, and if so, can you point to any one thing about being in the CSM that really put you off?
---
Vagabonds and Cynabals. For years, they were my "go to" ship for all sorts of fleets. I tend to think of EVE in terms of military strategy and I love the idea of light cavalry: flanking attacks and quick hit-and-run strikes. Vagabonds and Cynabals are so good at them. I love the purity of it, particularly in a gang size of 6-10.
---
Speaking of the Eve Collector's Edition, other than the immediate rewards and the Golden Pod implant from inputting the rewards code in the game, what else have they ever done with it?  Because I remember it was supposed to have "future value"
---
Yes! Yes yes yes! If there was a place for my play style in EVE, I'd still be playing. The first space MMO that brings back small gang fights and a place for small alliances to carve out their own niches independent of the big boys will have my loyalty.
---
And thank you. :-)
---
To add to this, I think a lot of times these issues are 2-fold:  
---
1. A lack of "product" leadership.  Meaning, no one in the org is truly focused on the product and who is consuming it and what their experience is.  No one is making sure that the features that are being developed are meeting the needs of the user.  It's a really tough job to do well.
---
2. In the absence of clear product vision, devs will allow what is technically feasible to drive the feature design.  When you give an engineer a vague objective with unclear requirements, they will take that objective and morph it into the thing that is the easiest or most interesting for them to accomplish and then go and make that thing.  More often than not, that thing is not what the customer wanted.
---
When you have those two factors in play, it is very very easy as a developer to get defensive about your work.  You have been given a problem and are solving it the best you know how.  There are a lot of ways to rationalize that, I think "you'll get used to it" is a pretty common one.
---
l e g a c y c o d e
---
It hasn't yet. EVE can survive for a good long while as Space EverQuest.
---
more money, more problems
---
EVE is Space EverQuest. The next five years will see the EVE player base drop very slowly, 5-10% per year as people like me get too old to play it and not enough younger players come in.
---
CCP will skin some whales during this time and make a decent amount of money but I don't have a lot of confidence that they will spend that money on anything I'll be interested in.
---
So CCP made changes after ignoring years of player complaints because either:
---
A) they started playing their own game again and until that point didn't believe the players
---
or;
---
B) because null sec complained about it
---
Neither is particularly great for a 'sandbox' game...

How do you think ccp's relation and attitutude with and towards the csm has changed in 5 years?
---
Did anyone ever raise a concern that releasing a PS3 exclusive tie in game to a PC exclusive game is in fact one of the most incredibly retarded things you could possibly do?
---
With all of your comments, you seem to have a lot of good things to say about CCP Seagull and bad things to say about CCP Fozzie. Why is  that? Is there a story behind that?
---
They could start with fixing the market data, which has been unreliable for at least 3 years.
---
Little bit of both. Also, people have been asking me "can I have your stuff" but the question has been deleted. There's actually a story behind that question, though:
---
About eight months ago, I got with Brisc Rubal and asked him to send me Guard's e-mail address. Brisc asked me what it was about. I told him that I was thinking about quitting EVE and that given that I was known for writing about EVE, I wanted to quit by having the biggest writing contest in the history of EVE, with a 750 billion ISK prize pool. Brisc passed Guard's e-mail to me. I already had Falcon's e-mail.
---
I contacted both of them through multiple means (E-mail and Reddit particularly), told them what I had in mind, told them that the writing contest would only feature people writing good things about EVE (one of the contest questions I had in mind: "Write about how has EVE made you a better person." I told them that I had no problem with them setting conditions on the contest and that I'd be open to them being judges. But I said I'd like some help organizing the contest and keeping it fair.
---
Neither of them responded to me.
---
&gt;1 vs 1 championship
---
Have you ever seen what happens when goons give up their numerical superiority? last year it involved getting trounced by skillu and then losing to test.
---
1. Are there any features that you think the playerbase, rather than CCP, unfairly ignored?
---
2. If you feel comfortable relaying it - what was the most outlandish idea that made it to the table?
---
3. You mentioned outpost destruction coming up as something that never got implemented- were there rumblings of what would become the Upwell structures? How different did they look from what we got?
---
No panchetta!? Savages!
---
that was 2013, now he wants to make nullsec more like WH because he lives in one ^^
---
I'm sorry I didn't start playing EVE earlier, and I'm sorry I didn't start blogging about EVE earlier.
---
I knew about EVE a good three years before I started playing it in 2007. A bunch of my friends were playing it. But I resisted because I thought all MMOs were like WoW, which I had no interest in at all. And the truth is, all MMOs *were* like WoW... except for EVE. My friends didn't do a good enough job of convincing me of that fact.
---
Had I started playing EVE earlier and started writing about EVE earlier, I kind of wonder if I could have made a bigger difference by the time I reached the CSM. I dunno. Maybe a vain belief.
---
&gt; reskinned Sansha incursion (but with mining, oh wow golly gee!)
---
Incursions also have a mining site.
---
&gt; I'm not looking for anything to get angry about or to hand out pitchforks over. I love this game and have been a staunch advocate/supporter of it since I started playing five years ago, both verbally and fiscally (RIP my IRL wallet lol).
---
Wait, who're you?
---
can I have your stuff?
---
The fact we have the Corp roles/titles system along side, and interlinked to, the access list system, starkly shows the age and flaws in the former system. I can only guess that it’s like pos code only harder to cut out.
---
Logi on killmails... please don't leave it at that. What about it particularly??????  
---
That's a painful topic.
---
Holy SHIT, I straight up thought the same about the D514 ideas Andie had. RIP Seagull, you were too good for us.
---
Oh fuck yea bud
---
I'll sound off on a couple of points here.   
---
1. E1 would never admit things went too far. He just didn't see it that way. 
---
2. E1 was in fact blackmailed. I won't get into particulars on that one.
---
I mean a gaming company that can only afford one community rep can hardly afford an 'economist'.
---
&gt; new player is intrigued and signs up. they inject themselves fairly quickly into high isk making - rorqual pilot or something.
---
I doubt there are over 100 players that signed up and then immediately injected up to a Rorqual "or something". And people that are buying that many injectors have no real need, I would imagine, to sub with PLEX.
---
I do agree that there's a massive botting issue.
---
And no, you really do spend a long time doing *essentially* nothing as a new player. Especially if you're an alpha for a while before subbing. I know this because I'm currently actively working with a half-dozen new players (new-new, literally explaining how to orbit shit) and outside of lvl1/2/3 missions they are not capable, skillwise, of doing much else.
---
The main investment for most games is time. A problem this game has is the time spent is passive... the only feeling of progression you can actually force is your isk wallet.
---
Hey jester,
---
You've mentioned that there's only two play styles that CCP truly supports right now. What, if anything, can we as players do to help convince CCP to listen to the other play styles? Is there any effective method for making our voices louder?
---
Wait what, really? I've never heard of this
---
Tbf the biggest thing I miss about Seagull era was roadmaps. We've not known whats coming  over 3 months down the line for a long while now.

Dude, the majority of PoS ship kills are rando landing on grid and getting killed by the automatic guns. Citadel kills are human gunned, how many people do you know trained to be POS gunners? Almost no one. The PoS gun auto- shot.
---
I'm going to keep this one short. Veritas had this whole plan for it that he was ready to implement. But he got a lot of push-back from other devs (he didn't say who) because he not only wanted to implement logi on kill-mails, he wanted the kill-mails to show logi *repairs* on destroyed ships.
---
So you'd be able to tell, out of the total HP done to the ship, not only who did the damage, but who did the most repairs.
---
Again, he never told me who pushed back on this idea.
---
yup, soul crushing 10 hour long 10% tidi fights are coming.... and it’s going to be glorious.
---
I still have a ship named Sexual Tyrannosaurus somewhere. Yes, it's a 'cane.
---
Be well!
---
That was the absolute best trailer ever! Hats off to the makers of that. Hats on to Hilmar.
---
I can't imagine how these salty bitches played when the skill queue was only 24h
---
\+3 for the music. You kinda overstayed your welcome but looked nice.
---
Once you're done with it, can I have his stuff?
---
Would you keep serving ice cream to a guy that went round explaining your recipe and dark ice cream secrets to everyone?
---
&gt; laughably short timespan
---
&gt; less than 3 years
---
I think you're a little out of touch, there.
---
And if this wasn't an option, one must ask *what is even the point* of trying to oppose older alliances? If everybody's hands are completely tied by time, obviously the oldest alliances would be untouchable.
---
CSMs 9 or 10 would have to comment on this, but Seagull was either being blocked by management or by her own troops. I never found out which it was.
---
Dis gon b gud
---
During the meetings, the sexual tension was so thick you could cut it a knife; did you make out with Mynnna?
---
Every time I've heard Hilmar speak, he tells the same story about how he had to replace a Thorax after he lost it in a fight in 2003. I think until very very recently, that's where his experience with EVE started and ended: 16 years ago.
---
I appreciated getting 4 super kills on top of a bunch of rorqs and apostles. Thanks Seddow!
---
... can you hypothesize on *why* anyone would not like that idea for logi killmails? At first blush, that seems like a great idea.  O_o
---
We never played together as I started winning Eve before you joined us but you're certainly a loss to the game. Good luck in whatever you do next
---
&gt; Would you keep serving ice cream to a guy that went round explaining your recipe and dark ice cream secrets to everyone?
---
I’m sorry, but this isn’t your local ice cream van. This is an elected set of individuals that were chosen to represent a large player base, and were _legally_  prohibited from speaking on the matter through an NDA. That NDA has now expired.
---
I’m not sure how it works in Iceland, but in many countries, firing/demoting/banning someone (whether from a game or from accessing your product, like the ice cream you sell) because you revealed previously privileged information that is no longer protected can be grounds for a lawsuit.
---
What  do you have the most time for/respect for? One still working there and one thats left.
---
I'm still burnt out from dad dicking GotG into paying us billions of ISK to fuck off.
---
mothership vs. world ark
---
maybe throw in a gurista sotiyo into the mix too.
---
No. Just no
---
Try orbiting them closely at speed.  This is called “speed tanking” as the pirate(rats) have trouble tracking higher speed moving targets.  Also be sure to target them and manually issue engage target commands to clear them.  You want them focused on the same target not split up.
---
1. My play style is as dead as fried chicken.
---
2. Con: it's an absolute ton of free work for which you will get no appreciation from either players or devs. Pro: you learn a *ton* about how software development happens and if you treat the opportunity for what it is, you learn a ton about how to motivate people with soft power.
---
3. People are asking really good questions so far! I'm surprised nobody's asked the Erotica 1 question yet, though.
---
4. Thanks. :-) If I'm not banned, I'll keep an eye out and at the very least, if there's a "last week of EVE" announced before the servers get shut down or whatever, I'll come back for that. And of course, if development changes in a major way to reopen play styles that I enjoy, I'll come back for that, too.
---
Wait, the client doesn't use language files for translation? that sounds like cancer
---
Thank god stopping someone from playing your video game doesn't turn into a lawsuit outside of the united states of litigation.
---
nobody who is currently playing Eve knows about erotica1 tbh dude :-(
---
Only thing I can think of, after they were working on their game for 6 years  
---
[https://i.imgur.com/vc98bjN.png](https://i.imgur.com/vc98bjN.png)
---
As you rightly point out, Eve has become very much homogenised in what you can do now, there used to be more fights and more reasons to fight. Now it's just protection of rorquals and posturing.
---
"Adapt or wait for the fixes"
---
\#FreeStunt
---
Wouldn't 2 and 4 just result in both ships dying?  Last I checked, if no on dies before the timer runs out, both ships are destroyed.  Am I wrong about that?...
---
There's people like that everywhere.
---
Maybe this is out of your purview, but can you elaborate on your impressions of Seagull's "Space Colonization" vision? Perhaps this was made clear through the devblogs and videos of the day, but I haven't really heard this term before.
---
yeah and most 1v1 encounters are decided whether or not you're amazing or dogshit as long as the other side is competent
---
there is A LOT you CAN be doing, but it's rare you even have to manage more than 2 at a time, and even then you could do it poorly and still win in abyssal 1v1s (unless the other side is trash)
---
What? Hilmar came back and went in WHs, and wanted to make the rest of Eve more like WHs.
---
If someone constructs a raiteru dyson sphere, that would be neat if CCP then converted it into a indestructible (and undockable) monument).
---
Second bullet sounds about right.
---
As a software developer (different industry) anybody with the first attitude didn't last very long.  Most of the people I've worked with cared very deeply if the product fits the customers' needs and/or had pain points that needed to be addressed.
---
Of course there are user requests that simply don't fit the infrastructure or violate system requirements.  In my industry we give them the engineering estimate and supporting documents for the former.  That usually gets them to decide to live with it.  Occasionally the refactoring has been greenlit.
---
This would be fan-fucking-tastic.
---
16 dps goes quite a ways above "small gang", but your point stands at least in the case of one or two carriers. We're usually out with about half those numbers.
---
By no means do you have to adopt Goon meta to hold sov. But you do have to adopt it if you want to do serious industry, which is what separates TEST from the likes of Horde.
---
do you unironically believe that teamspeak ransoming is a violation of the geneva convention
---
Wow, rude. Same to you.
---
It's been in the game forever.
---
I hope they cyno jammer eavry system wit 4-5 jammers.

Kestrel, the dual web armor kestrel is one of the best and most flexible t1 frigates to solo with in fw space, and the suitonia kestrel is the best t1 frig for nullsec.

\- can you share with us something about your future plans?
---
\- are you going to play something else?
---
\- where can one follow you?
---
(not that i want you to leave, you were a great reading always. more likely i would like to follow your writings...)
---
Sorry but I find it very hard to believe the blackmail stuff.
---
E1 was the very definition of a psychopath. He literally got off on causing people anguish.
---
He had no sense of right or wrong.
---
As soon as he realised that he was going to get banned he suddenly switched to being the victim of some Goon conspiracy and that the whole blackmail story materialised.
---
A few people I spoke to at the time claimed it was true but they were unable to speak about it which was very convenient.
---
The truth as I see it was that he tried to use the blackmail story as way to gain sympathy in order to deflect the hate that was aimed in his direction.
---
fac webs + links makes a huge difference, really helps with being able to web things in a relatively safe manner - our hyena boys always tell us to bring a bifrost alt, haha

first of all things never stand still orbit something like a rock or an orca . a prop mod like after burner or  micro warp drive might help.
---
than drones only have a limited range if enemys lock and attack you allready befor the range is reached the drones do not compute, ( you have to send them maually within range) this can be offset with skills .
---
also if this not help  get a repair modul/shield booster to be longer on the field and/or to buy you time  to escape.
---
btw.  did those rats have  a symbol in front of the name  like a smal dimond? if so they are  fob (forward operation base) rats and  you should consider to change into a other system as long its active.those guys are nasty especialy for smaller/newplayer fits.
---
Since you're winning eve. I believe the real customary question is... can I have your stuff?
---
Also Thanks for years of great blogs. It's been a true pleasure.
---
There can only be 1 ihub though.
---
Best and worst thing you feel has been added into EvE.
---
Best and worst idea you've heard form CCP that hasn't been implemented?
---
Is there any sense of concern (or even acknowledgement) between the developers &amp; management that the single greatest bottleneck regarding server performance is stackless python?
---
Damn, I was wondering what happened to your contest. /sigh
---
idgaf, have fun writing a narrative for nothing happening.
---
Why in your opinion does CCP give no fucks about the AT, yes its a small playing player base, but imo its the most hardcore playerbase, and has a greater viewership than even i thought by the community backlash that followed their " postponed TM" announcement.
---
Can you put a DST with containers inside into a ship maintanance bay?
---
Your not the only one. And HE knows it.
---
He didn't even gave us a hug :(
---
Ok so you know what I see in that better then my self. ? 
---
All I was stay is what I think it means it doesn't speak off these fleets set up in sights defending them.
---
Ok, thanks. I added a Medium Shield Extender, compact afterburner and a bunch of other stuff to my Venture, and managed to kill 2 of the NPC ships without taking any damage, so clearly somethings working now!

Oh, I have a lot of memories that I'll take with me. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/blqwkx/what_was_your_favorite_war_battle_moment_in_eve/ems2xmx/?context=0) ranks pretty high. Others:
---
* taking on four bombers and a Daredevil that had a freighter tackled solo in a Ranis... and winning.
---
* Rote Kapelle beating PL with a deliberately underpointed comp in AT10... and winning.
---
* Following MukkBarovian in his Tempest all over Scalding Pass and Curse and Great Wildlands in 2009 once or twice a night for almost a year.
---
* Kind of oddly, The Mittani contacted me after the infamous wizard hat incident and asked for my advice on how he should respond. We ended up having an almost two hour Skype convo about that and lots and lots of other things. That's the only time I ever talked to him one-on-one.
---
* The very nice EVE mails I've gotten over the years about this or that blog posting have been really nice.

There's lots of others, but those are some highlights.

Holy Crap, that sounds like an amazing contest. Judging by some of your other responses the non-response sounds both par for the course  and incredibly crushing. Loved your blog, was a huge factor in my early/mid-game Eve career. Thanks much!
---
Benefit of the game handling it by itself is that it can stream a different view than what you see yourself, it could censor everything if it wanted to, hiding names and chats, for example.
---
&gt; I pushed hard for completely changing EVE's login/account schema. I pushed for what I called a "WXYZ" structure for EVE accounts
---
amazing, ccp is retarded
---
Out of loyalty to a CCP dev that I really like and respect (even though he doesn't like me that much), I'll keep this pretty vague: some of the things that CCP said about *Fearless* and the ideas in it during their furious backpedaling sessions were blatantly not true. A lot of the stuff that they said was speculative and that they didn't really mean to do in *Fearless*? Yeah, they meant to do those things and would have had the Summer of Rage not stopped them.
---
Never ever forget:
---
sent by hilmar to ccp global list-
---
(strt)
---
We live in interesting times; in fact CCP is the kind of company that if things get repetitive we instinctively crank it up a notch. That, we certainly have done this week. First of we have Incarna, an amazing technological and artistic achievement. A vision from years ago realized to a point that no one could have imaged but a few months ago. It rolls out without a hitch, is in some cases faster than what we had before, this is the pinnacle of professional achievement. For all the noise in the channel we should all stand proud, years from now this is what people will remember.
---
But we have done more, not only have we redefined the production quality one can apply to virtual worlds with the beautiful Incarna but we have also defined what it really means to make virtual reality more meaningful than real life when it comes to launching our new virtual goods currency, Aurum.
---
Naturally, we have caught the attention of the world. Only a few weeks ago we revealed more information about DUST 514 and now we have done it again by committing to our core purpose as a company by redefining assumptions. After 40 hours we have already sold 52 monocles, generating more revenue than any of the other items in the store.
---
This we have done after months of research by a group of highly competent professionals, soliciting input and perspective from thought leaders and experts in and around our industry. We have communicated our intention here internally in very wide circles through the Virtual Economy Summit presentation at the GSM, our Fearless newsletter, sprint reviews, email lists and multiple other channels. This should not come as a surprise to anyone.
---
Currently we are seeing _very predictable feedback_ on what we are doing. Having the perspective of having done this for a decade, I can tell you that this is one of the moments where we look at what our players do and less of what they say. Innovation takes time to set in and the predictable reaction is always to resist change.
---
We went out with a decisive strategy on pricing and we will stay the course and not flip flop around or knee jerk react to the predictable. That is not saying nothing will change, on the contrary, in fact we know that success in this space is through learning and adapting to _what is actually happening_ and new knowledge gained in addition to what we knew before and expected.
---
All that said, I couldnât be prouder of what we have accomplished as a company, changing the world is hard and we are doing it as so many times before! Stay the course, we have done this many times before.
---
(end)
---
Or you know, the addition of CCP Ghost and his work on new player retention started the change?
---
&gt;Fozzie is notorious for this (or was, when I was on the CSM). At one point, I was making a point about how HACs were used in small-gang battles and how they should be changed, and he wouldn't engage with me on the topic until after I'd answered a question: "Well, which HACs do you think are the ones that are most used?" It was kind of infuriating to have these check-points thrown at us. To be fair, I was able to answer to the question to Fozzie's satisfaction and after that, he agreed to talk with me about it, but only after that.
---
So Fozzy is a dick with a massively over-inflated sense of self-importance. What a shock (/s)
---
I got some fights out of them already
---
Honestly, as the server population falls, it appears that we are moving in that direction.
---
If there were a way and I could think of it, I would share it. It would take a wholesale change in how the current game is structured, that's for sure.
---
That's what I want, more enemies
---
Tack on to other parts of this. 
---
How important do you believe the diversity of experts from different play-styles is to the CSM functioning to provide accurate feedback to CCP. 
---
Specifically non-hardcore PVE and non-Bloc pilots, do you believe CSM representation will make a difference in our forms of gameplay, and if so how?
---
It would be interesting, but I'd be willing to bet Eve players would've hated the idea of people in a different game hijacking their ships.
---
There have been rumblings from I think ingame lore news about generation ships or city ships, as well as that in construction trig station.  What sort of thing was Seagull planning for this?
---
&gt;botting alliances NC, PL and PH and whoever else gets in the way of its spaceship hurricane 
---
spicy hot take here
---
Because what made her ideas so great were that they were big sweeping changes with grandiose vision. That sort of stuff costs money. Lots of it.
---
See, here's the thing: CCP devs are not allowed to play the game in leadership roles of large null-sec alliances. So they don't really understand how those alliances work. And they simply don't have a good feel for the *control* that operates in those alliances.
---
Every CCP dev I've ever talked to who seems to have good in-game knowledge has it in areas that are fundamentally single-player sorts of things: industry and mining and missions, stuff like that. But when I would bring up things that are commonplace to EVE players, things like alarm clock ops and the logistics of moving ships around on a large scale and storage of thousands of modules or anything else that involved large scale operations, they had no idea.
---
I've often told the story about how I'd show devs how my hangar was broken up into a few dozen containers with one for ammo, one for mods, one for drones, one for drugs, etc. The devs I showed this to were, to a person, *shocked* that this was the case. It just never occurred to any of them the *scale* that things in EVE happen in.
---
So the answer to your question is "no", devs that I talked to never played above what the average EVE player would consider a casual level.
---
I was always frustrated by that as well. I remember even alliance leaders saying well you didn’t have a platform.
---
Kind of annoying that the thing which in my opinion made you the best candidate is the exact thing that worked against you.
---
Without chatting btw, just appeared.
---
Resists need to reduce more and faster in abyssal pvp room.
---
You're missing the part where you reply in the right place, by about 7 light years...
---
A huge segment of the MMO market caters to casual gamers. EVE has always seemed to push back against that, with the “anything goes in the sandbox” mentality.
---
But it’s inhibited growth from the beginning, and it always will. As the game begins to wither and die, expect to see CCP taking more and more long-overdue steps to make EVE playable for people who just want to play a massively multiplayer space game without getting griefed.
---
But it’s still too late.
---
As much as Eve players love to rip on World of Warcraft, that game has allowed you to merge all your multiboxing accounts under one login since forever ago.
---
Might be the most flown but it is certainly not oppressive.
---
BPCs for what though? If there were any cap ships being released we'd know about it 10 days before release.
---
There's always all sorts of rumors about this but the CSM is so closely monitored that you simply wouldn't believe it. I'll give an example.
---
Before the Leopard was introduced, there was some discussion about a super-fast shuttle that would be introduced into the game. The original plan was to modify one of the existing shuttles, the Guristas Shuttle, to play this role.
---
At the time, I literally had about five Guristas Shuttles buried in a can in a corporate hangar for my alt corp in a high-sec system far from my main staging system.
---
Fozzie pulled me aside, told me about the shuttles, and told me that the devs didn't care too much that I had them but they would be watching to see if I bought more.
---
The eyes on your behavior are literally to that level. Or at least they were. I have to question that now in the light of what happened to Brisc.
---
That's fair but doesn't really affect the point.
---
Don't forget the god awful UI
---
Make it take a week long timer to kill too
---
&gt; If caps are a problem they should be nerfed instead of throwing subcap balance out the window.
---
Yes, exactly.
---
local and all other chats are dead/malfunctioning again
---
A dead game can't get sick...
---
this does a really good job showing Hilmar as the clueless, disconnected idiot he has always appeared to be. Its a shame he has control of Eve.
---
Can confirm major chat problems in high-sec as well. Local doesn't update when jumping to other systems and our corp chat won't load at all. Completely empty
---
*Just now*, rewatching the Dominion trailer, when the Russian fleet dialogue starts, the hair on my arms and the back of my neck stands up and I get the chills and goosebumps. "Just burn them all. This system belongs to us."
---
As to Hilmar not understanding why the Russians would be there, 'This system belongs to us." That's why, dude. Get with it.
---
Oh! Sorry, missed that bit. And the answer is yes. Jon Lander saved EVE Online after the Summer of Rage. Anyone who is still playing EVE today owes that to Jon Lander. I'm convinced the game would have died years ago if not for him.
---
He stepped up, listened to the player base, and started delivering what the players wanted instead of what CCP management wanted. After he resigned as Executive Producer, I actually bought him a bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue (I'd heard he was a fan), left it on his desk, and sent him the following e-mail:
---
Hi Jon,
---
I left something on your desk at CCP that is Odyssey blue.  If it is not to your specific liking, please feel free to re-gift it to whatever purpose you choose. 
---
But I did want to give you a private gift and say THANK YOU.
---
When I first heard you were coming on board to be the Senior Producer (at that time) for EVE Online, I didn't have the first clue who you were or what qualified you for the job.  I immediately pinged Mark/Seleene and asked "Cripes, who is this guy?  I've never heard of him!"  Mark assured me that you were awesome and that I should keep an eye on you.  And so keep an eye on you I did.  At first, I had my doubts. 
---
But the interviews you gave soon after entering your position slowly convinced me that EVE players were blessed with a real winner, in the right job, at the right time.  How you approached the players convinced me further.  By last summer, you had made a believer out of me.  As far as I'm concerned, your attitude, enthusiasm, and kick-ass approach saved EVE Online.  I'm sorry to see you go, but I understand the reasons for it.
---
Best of luck in your new position and I look forward to seeing what you do with it.

You've brought up Seagall's "Aggressive" plans a few times. I'm assuming the one shown during fanfest was very tame in compessison.
---
Any chance you could MS paint the road map/plans from memory? Or purhaps just a 1,2,3?
---
Check out the WH group, WR0NG ... small, helpful and no @ss-hats.

Northern refugee here to mildly interrupt some stuff  😄
---
Might be a nightmare for crimewatch? I don't know, but I suspect the main reason we don't have logi on killmails (friendly and hostile) is that the game isn't 100% nullsec, and performance would take a nose-dive in low/high. Worse than it already does, I mean.
---
This is definitely a sign that Upwell structures are well balanced and not at all spammable
---
Yikes, dawg
---
THAT is a way bigger answer than I can do in an AMA, hee.
---
Thanks. Yeah, we traded our Jackdaw for that Orthrus at the end and decided to call it.
---
wheres our free SP CCP?
---
That was kinda my point...
---
&gt; turn ownership of the ship to the winning side in the DUST 514 battle was not only possible, it was something that could be implemented in a relatively short period
---
As a long time, but now ex-EVE and DUST 514 player, this shit fucking breaks my heart.
---
/u/jestertrek, were there any real plans to release Project Legion at any point in it's development? It literally showed up with wonderful gameplay at a fanfest and was gone a month later.
---
Well... what about Erotica?? What's your take?
---
Yep, local and fleet chat are broken again. Good thing we moved the chat system to such a stable new model, right.
---
That would explain why they added the ACL system to them instead of using just the corp/alliance/standing structure
---
&gt;There were and are some devs that simply don't give a shit that there are players out there and that we maybe know the game
---
I just want to play devil's advocate here. I'm not a game developer, but am a senior application engineer, so I've dealt a lot with users and various communities over the years.
---
The problem is that vocal users are often wrong at face value. The things they suggest or have ideas on, just won't work because of XYZ or will break ABC and totally fuck DEF. They don't realize this, but can get very vocal about the things they think are right and can easily rally other vocal users to be in the same train of thought. And I'm not talking about just things that need to be coded, I am talking about breaking other UX patterns or overall flows that are specifically designed to be a certain way because of reasons that aren't always apparent to the end user. This results in a fuck ton of noise coming out of a vocal minority.
---
Unfortunately, gamers are by a wide margin the worst about these kinds of things and get very angry and... let's face it, entitled, about the game or even the tools surrounding the game. I will never make a public app for the EVE community, or any other game I play, for this reason. I've done it before. You start with something you love doing having fun giving back to something you enjoy, and it gets twisted into something you absolutely hate. When people email you 100 times a day with death threats because the thing you built had a hiccup or doesn't work exactly the way they envision it should, it's hard to keep enjoying it. I've known people give up very successful money generating projects, purely because they didn't want to deal with the toxicity spewing from the people using it anymore.
---
Those CCP devs probably could have handled the situations you described with more tact, but I can definitely feel where they are coming from.
---
Sounds like they were just watching you.
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
I have been appropriately wooshed.

Bad mocking aside, your future looks bright, keep it going

So when he said at Evesterdam that the biggest driver to retaining players was finding a corp as if that was brand new information..?
---
Locals fucked up?! Time to hunt those bots boys and girls!
---
Yup you’re speed tanking and better fit for survival!  Wtg!  This is 90% of the game just remember always orbit... FFS(fit for survival) 
---
Always have a bailout if you need it don’t worry about drones you can always warp back after you’ve repaired and reconnect to drones to recover them.
---
Having weird chat fluctuations, lost all channels at one point, getting MAJOR chat lag
---
Bwahahahaha! I loved naming my ships after 80s movie one-liners. That was so fun.
---
It kind of is. Tell me would you be annoy / pissed if some random events happen that you had no influence over, and suddenly your in your pod or back in station, having just lost a ship that took a good amount off work to get ?
---
You're probably better off kiting HS belt rats, they can only shoot to 15km or something.
---
NSH is part of the gon coalition now? that's a shame
---
Can you answer it, though? However you need to answer it
---
Follow-up, because I am afraid I don't know you too well. What's your playstyle, and when did it die?
---
... jesus fuck, don't say that. I didn't feel THIS old when I got up to piss last night. Twice.
---
Shit, give it to the pod and planet guys.
---
ya, the giant bomber fleets only a couple of alliances can save rorquals tackled by them, which encourages rorqual mining in said alliances even more.
---
I'm sensing a farewell blog topic here... 
---
If you do have tips and advice on this at all, it would be a boon to the EVE community moving forward! As a late joiner to the EVE universe (2018), I've still got the naivete to sink some time into stuff like this :).
---
Do you think the economy will drive people to quit EvE? And do you think EvE is dying overall?
---
This shit happens every god damn time. I lose all my intel channels. This shit is getting really annoying CCP....
---
There's always \*something\* happening.
---
Maybe some drifter BS too
---
I can back up the notion that Hilmar could be extremely clueless about the content of EVE and what made (makes) it interesting
---
Is New Eden in a different cluster in the Milky Way or is New Eden in a different galaxy?
---
Good luck with whatever you choose to be passionate about after Eve!
---
&gt; things like alarm clock ops
---
This doesn't seem like you need a leadership role to experience. I did my fair share of alarm clock ops without ever being more than a grunt. Unless you mean the *planning* of these ops.
---
Nah, it's fine. Re-reading it, my post was shit.
---
There is a huge battle going on in the Spire that's why it is
---
That's how tidi super fights work today, you have to be prepared for disconnects or mods not activating when you undock your super for a big fight. 
---
Adding this element of gameplay adds the right kind of risk to using the big toys, and a pretty cool kind of gameplay.
---
Noted Thank you man. I saw a lot of good videos regarding kestrels but not as many for the condor
---
What other styles do you especially miss?
---
&gt; or the Sansa one, 
---
Wait! When did Eve turn in to GoT?
---
Oh. Nevermind. ;)
---
Have you gotten any reaction yet from CCP, about this AMA?
---
First and foremost, thank you for everything you’ve ever poured into this game and it’s community. I often look at your term in the CSM, your blog, and how connected to the player base you were and wish there was that same vigor in modern day CSM (partially CCP fault).
---
Your blog and your website really helped push me over the ledge into this giant ocean of eve and now I’m stuck. It encouraged me and got me excited to find a wormhole to call home and carve my own path in the Eveverse. 
---
I see your other responses that you are quitting because they killed your play style, what exactly was your play style? Would you ever come back? What would it take to spark your interest again? are there any other games that catch your interest? Do you think any of these other space ship wannabes(old man star, etc.) will ever be able to recreate something even close to what we love in EVE?
---
Sorry, I only play and keep up with EvE sporadically, though I am subbed here. It’s Sansha right?
---
But...but...CCP said it was fixed and they weren't going to roll chat back!
---
They probably accidentally repair enemy ships a lot in fleet fights.
---
Finally they fixed local in WHs.   Sweet.
---
The fact that it even IS opaque is already telling.
---
&gt; The ESS.
---
Hey, we found a very nice use for it. Works well if you want to trigger locals and make them warp into bubble :)

Not sure what your skills are, but I fit a venture with a small T2 shield booster, T2 shield boost amp, and a cap recharger in the mids. A mining laser upgrade in the lows. Rat appropriate resist rigs (maybe one capacitor control circuit, can't remember). Basically just be cap stable. Then you can use mining drones to boost your mining output. Just ignore the rats in highsec, so long as you're orbiting you'll be fine\*.
---
\*This is minmatar space, so shields are good against kinetic/explosive damage, so ymmv in amarr space for example.
---
Even now, x years later, the monochrome necom still angers me.
---
As someone else who won Eve due to his small gang playstyle getting erased: o7
---
A few questions:
---
1. Are the changes that pulled Eve away from when the sandbox was more respected mostly due to a) greed (Eve is fine but if we do X we could make even more cash), b) desperation (Eve is not fine and we need to do X to stay aloat), or c) incompetence/cluelessness?
---
1. Were player suggestions on the forums, or other community interactions, ever taken seriously? It sounds like even CSM had issues being heard unless they already had a bully pulpit. Is there any point to any of the clamor in the forums and social media?
---
1. What are some good and bad things about the software development processes at CCP? As a software engineer myself (and having considered applying to work at CCP a long time ago), I am curious.
---
1. Why was the Rifter abandoned as the face of Eve in favor of the Venture? :( (Ed: this was after your time in CSM I guess, but it still bothers me)
---
&gt; your chances of getting a particular feature you want implemented is about 2%.
---
That's a few orders of magnitude too optimistic
---
Yeah it's a good idea but at least give the guy being invaded the feeling off being able to fight back. Managing ai defence or calling for ally boarders for help.
---
Kestrel best for solo PvP, Condor best for scout/fleet tackle.
---
After a *long time* where nothing was done with it, [we did get some Mystery Code stuff last year](https://www.eveonline.com/article/pamcd3/concord-saro-skins-and-combat-suits-gifted-to-mystery-code-holders).
---
Will be awarded 1 year after incident.
---
How will you find fake relevance in your life without this game? It’s clear from your stories and your writing style that you are an insufferable boor in real life. Did it occur to you do do this AMA in a genuine way and you decided to keep acting fake or are you genuinely this fake?
---
&gt;Jon Lander saved EVE Online after the Summer of Rage. Anyone who is still playing EVE today owes that to Jon Lander. I'm convinced the game would have died years ago if not for him.
---
Could you perhaps elaborate on this?
---
We also fought for this in CSM 5 and 6 and it never made it. Some people didn't want it to be, although it was usually sold as 'technically complex'
---
Yeah, I guess it is a big one :) But it might have immense value to the community.
---
I don't think it was necessarily stupid to create a consult in game, but it was definitely not a good idea to choose a console that it was at the end of its life.
---
Aren't you the guy who got kicked out of Treasury for showing other people how to bot? You're username is _awfully_ familiar.
---
Looks like a bunch of Supers/titans moved from Venal to Germinate. I assume NC. super fleet moving to protect their renters in the drone lands.
---
I have to tune in on the Bob Ross marathon on twitch every 2 or 3 days to calm myself because these incompetent fucks are stressing me out.
---
You mentioned earlier that there was a bunch of stuff done that never saw the light of day like taking over Supers. Do you have some more tales about Dust 514 to tell?
---
You need to first pick a faction you want to do missions for (i.e. Caldari, Gallente, Sisters of Eve, etc...) then you use the agency to find securty agents for that faction.
---
Exactly windsquid - FC handled it pretty well in the end.  Content was provided all round.  Does go to show that even in a cosy nullsec carebear blob fleet you do still have to pay atention.
---
Which is also out of mining laser range.  No. You’re better off fitting for survival and killing them.  It’s not hard.
---
Calm down there hitler
---
It's not like it would have been out of character for people's irl info to be bartered.
---
&gt;If I get x number of votes we'll release irl info on \[person\].
---
Fozzy is originally from Montreal (and he’s still a Canadiens’ fan). 514 is the local area code.
---
I don't think anyone has ever won a lawsuit they filed for being banned from an MMO in the US. China however, has laws that protect people from being banned, even if they were doing something illegal like botting.
---
It's like Deja Vu all over again.
---
Implying you cant type without your index finger
---
E1 lied a lot. He was great at it. He used his talents to make ISK. He crossed all sorts of lines along the way. The lying was never the real problem from the community and developer standpoint. But that's another conversation. He really wasn't lying about the blackmail. I'm not basing my view on snippets I heard from one character or another. I saw what they had on him. I can't say anything more without doxxing E1 and doing harm to him IRL. He lied about many things, but he wasn't lying about that.
---
I think player metagaming and streamlining the most efficient ways of doing things created this problem though. It's becoming common in all games now.
---
I liked dr. Eyjo. He seemed to know his shit and he actually cared about the players and was trying to keep things balanced and interesting. But I never felt as if the rest of CCP took him very seriously.
---
OK, Erotica 1. This is another fairly long story.
---
Let's start with the bit that will surprise everyone: I'd never heard of E1 until Falcon told me about him. Here's how it went down. After the Winter Summit of 2014 (which took place in late January, IIRC), CSM8 had an extra day and during that extra day, most of us had a number of informal sessions with CCP Falcon about a number of topics.
---
E1 was the topic of one of those informal sessions. He told us that E1 had appeared on CCP Security's radar and had prompted a very vigorous discussion among the GM team about how far the EULA went and whether E1 was breaking it. In particular, they were very concerned that E1 was deliberately side-stepping the EULA by drawing his victims out of the EVE client and onto other media. At the time, gamer suicides were in the news and the Community team was concerned that sooner or later, E1 was going to prompt one and CCP was going to catch some of the blame.
---
So Falcon laid this all on us, what the GMs were struggling with, what CCP was struggling with, the legal implications, all of it. Needless to say, at this session there were no good solutions found to any of these questions. We were sympathetic of course but a lot of us (including myself) felt very uncomfortable about advising Falcon about a specific player's actions. Hell, a few of us (again including me) chatted at breakfast the next morning and were kind of uncomfortable even about being told about it.
---
CCP has kind of a hidden rule that I'm convinced they follow in situations like this: **"When in doubt, wait."** Wait for things to get better, or worse, or for the situation to become more clear-cut. So that's what they did for the next couple of months and during that time, E1's depredations became more and more egregious.
---
The other thing you have to understand is that CCP generally and the Community team in particular was not above taking advantage of me. I had several devs over the years come to me behind the scenes and say "You know, Jester, we were thinking about doing [X] but you blogged about it and there was such a negative outcry about your blog post that we've decided not to do it. But keep doing what you're doing because your good ideas are good and even your bad ideas keep us out of trouble sometimes." And I would always sarcastically say that I was happy to help. ;-)
---
So as E1 became more and more egregious and I heard more and more about him behind the scenes, I became convinced that what he was going was not only bad as a person but bad for the game. I did my research outside of what Falcon had told me and decided that I was going to tell his story to a wider audience. Because at that time, believe it or not, E1 was actually not very well-known at all. There was no Reddit at that time, little to no forum coverage of him on Kugu or the other EVE forums and he was trying to maintain a fairly low profile except through occasional SoundCloud postings of the bonus room.
---
I went to Falcon, told him I was going to write the post, sent him the draft, and said that I wanted to be careful not to violate NDA since he had shared some information about him with us. He wrote back saying that CCP had decided they were going to do about him (but that he wouldn't share their decision with me because CCP didn't share that kind of thing with the CSM), he had no problems with me posting about E1 and I shouldn't worry about an NDA violation, and that he'd actually be really interested in what response I got.
---
So let's be clear here: [what I posted on my blog about E1](http://jestertrek.blogspot.com/2014/03/the-bonus-round.html) was done with CCP's foreknowledge and consent. What happened after I posted it, I think people are aware of. But the opinion that some people had that I got E1 banned is absurd and Falcon came out publicly shortly after my post and made it clear that it wasn't Jester who got E1 banned, it was E1 that got E1 banned and CCP was going to do it no matter what Jester had to say on the subject.
---
*After* that, though, the level of shit that I had to deal with about it... I'm not going to share that, but it wasn't pleasant. I was physically threatened but that wasn't even the worst of it. The constant and continuing harassment that I suffered for years afterward was the worst of it. Harassment that happened both in game and out of game. To use one example: for about a year after E1 got banned, James 315's disciples told anyone that they ganked that I would handle reimbursement of their ships. It took a *fucking year* before the GMs put a stop to it.
---
I'm actually 100% convinced that I've met Erotica 1. At Fanfest 2014 or 2015 (I forget which), a particular individual approached me who had *lots* of questions for me about E1... and this someone had a pretty familiar voice and knew *way* more about E1 than the casual player should have known. I didn't let on that I knew who I was talking to and I was very careful to stick to public places for the rest of that FF after that encounter.
---
Do I regret it, looking back? No. I did the right thing. There is evil in the world and it must be opposed. I did that and I'm proud of it.
---
What was CCP's reaction? I think CCP was more than happy to let me take the bulk of the heat about it, with the exception of a couple of devs that went out of their way to say that they appreciated how I'd handled my end of it.
---
And that's my E1 story.
---
Do you believe that the break up of PLEX and the release of skill injectors is a rework of the monocle and summer of rage and will lead to a slippery slope?
---
CSM 10 representative here. I never got any inkling that it was from the bottom up. So while I don't have any evidence that it was top down, I would have to assume it is top down.
---
Imperium talking about botting, what a joke.
---
I think you underestimate how office politics work. You want to get like 50 things, ask for 100 and bargain out 75. If the other party has a strong arguments or politics are involved (give some, take some) you can drop down to 50 or 25 and at least still get something out of it.
---
That was actually a parent of a student that was killed during the incident., not a student. The image was taken after the incident
---
But if you die they won't reimburse because they can't access the chat logs!
---
ESS?
---
It's tough to watch the sausage being made. ;-)
---
But no, the idea that the CSM killed the blog is inaccurate. The CSM probably kept the blog going for about eight months after it would have ended without the CSM. The many upsides of it just weren't worth all of the downsides.
---
&gt; How much influence do the nullsec blocks really have in the CSM?
---
I once got offered an ISK bribe by a member of a large alliance to bring up something during the summit in Iceland lol.
---
&gt; the botting alliances NC, PL and PH
---
...so your ignoring init, test, frat.
---
also....PH?  come on. where were we on that chart.  throw crap at NC if ya want.  but leave us out of it. we avoided that chart.
---
wont be much battle "swings" as people dont engage unless they sure they can win, and nowadays people will happily let the titan die to avoid a fight they cant win cause stuff is easy to replace.
---
(we seriously need something to encourage people to ACTUALLY FIGHT even if outnumbered, nullsec is becoming as cautious as carebears in highsec when it comes to avoiding fights if they outnumbered)
---
I was going to do five questions, with a 150 billion ISK prize for each.
---
Oh shit. Good thing I check before logging my krab dread whilist inside a WHSOC krab hole.
---
Yeah war is coming... but not in delve ;)
---
&gt;or the Sansa one
---
Spoiler: She marries Sansha Kuvakei and they become the new power couple in Westeros
---
Sansa and Sansha Kuvakei.... or do they take her name? Sansa and Sansha Stark... hmmm
---
Aren't they suppose to be changing back to the old chat system here? I thought CCP put out something to the extent that if they dont figure it out in a month they were reverting back.
---
CCPLZ: IF I WANTED TO PLAY DUNGEONS AND RAIDS I WOULD ROLL A PVE TOON IN WoW..!! Aren’t Incursions and FoB’s lessons learned? :-(

---
I saw this post before going to bed last night, and had a nightmare about those little boxes popping up everywhere, even outside of EVE
---
Greater Western Co-Prosperity Sphere isn't goons of course
---
Thanks very much. :-)
---
I actually got that a lot: "I love to get to work in the morning, get my coffee, then bring up your blog and see what you wrote that morning before I get to work." That comment always made me smile.
---
It really depends on the region your in. Find something that’s semi easy to make but sells a lot on the market. Typically ships are the easiest to start with. It also depends on if you’re going to mine the minerals or just buy the off the market to build with.
---
Hey it’s better than the burger King Commercial.

\#hahaha fuckers
---
Have you ever tried running a nano 10mn Hyena instead of going mwd?  Been thinking about it lately as a way to further decrease sig since tank is soooooooo non existent on these things, wondering how viable it would really be lol...  Mount faction webs; go in at an angle, and in the event you need to make a hard turn make sure you deactivate the prop first, then turn back on once you're done with the maneuver.   
---
Cool to try; or theorycrafting in a vaccum?
---
No, but he provided the statistical data for it while also narrowing down the corp sizes that have the best player retention. 
---
Also no, they also looked into war decs and players actions in them, and how that related to player retention and activity.
---
You may say, oh no shit, but having the data there actually proves what was before just anecdotal evidence.
---
Logibro and Bro before him. Dolan. Gargant. Veritas. A couple of others.
---
None of them ever got any support from management. From what I understand, they wouldn't even pay overtime for all the time CCP employees would spend their weekends running the tournament for most of the years the tournament ran. They treated it as something devs would have to do on their own time.
---
Only when eSports started to spin up did the employees doing this work get any real support from management and even then it was half-hearted from what I understand.
---
&gt;reopen play styles
---
Which play styles do you consider dead?
---
You can't argue that the amount of DPS from an astra isn't absurd though. It's far, far more dangerous than a POS and you cant defang it, and it has an additional timer and asset safety. The risk/reward ratio is just ridiculous for those.
---
I can absolutely understand the "no leadership position" rule for Devs, but even if they were F1-monkeys in a big 0.0 block an participated at least once or twice a week in alliance ops they would get a feel for the sov-system / citadel spam / rorqual problems / capitals everywhere / etc... thats really sad CCP :(
---
I dont get why they dont make it mandantory for all devs to play the game at least some hours per week (while at work), would help them to stay in touch with the "ingame reality"...
---
Good shit kid. My last comment on your thread got my double platinum.
---
Best bit of advice I can give. If you want to stay around here long. Don’t let anyone in who isn’t about your corp. 
---
Many corps inevitably let in folk who oogle and gaggle over the big name corps. They want the prestigious internet space ship recognition. 
---
If you promote these people into leadership they will get poached by their idols and leave your corp in taters.
---
So botters v botters. Next they're gonna write super scripts so they dont have to fight at all. GLHF
---
I really enjoy being in a subcap mining fleet. Chilling on comms talking to the other miners. If you can muti-box a few covetors can match and even beat a Rorq if they have boosts.
---
Triggered?

I'd look to a longer-serving CSM member to give this topic justice but we in CSM 8 heard about it a *lot*.
---
One example that comes to mind is Brain-in-a-Box. It came up both of our Summits, and many times in convos with Veritas in between. And every time Veritas brought it up, he would ask us to go to Seagull and ask her to give more resources to it. He wouldn't go to his own management, he went to us and was open and honest that we had a more direct line to his management than he did.
---
Once Veritas started bringing it up openly in Summits, other devs did too, and saying the same thing. One dev told me openly that I had had more conversations with EVE's Senior Manager at the time (whose name escapes me at this exact moment) than he had. CCP Affinity was another one that would pull those of us in CSM 8 that had an interest in better PvE tools and ask us to advocate for more staffing for her team.
---
Like I said, it's something we heard a lot.
---
It's the 1st sign of the Triglavian Invasion!
---
It happened after I left CSM8. Something happened in 2015 or 2016 that shifted the dev's focus and shifted CCP's focus away from EVE.
---
At the time I was on the CSM, we heard about DUST 514 fairly frequently but never once did we hear about a mass movement of money and effort to non-EVE games.
---
what a shame, as showing top reps would be awesome!
---
i mean usually but this doesn't have to make sense
---
&gt;"you'll get used to it". He said both about monochrome Neocom icons when those were pushed out, 
---
And now it's industry standart.
---
Well atleast GOONS stopped pretending years ago that they were on the verge of extinction.
---
That’s what I was seeing and thinking based off of what I’ve seen so far
---
I really hope CCP reads through this thread, seems alot of good information and frankly good criticisms in here.
---
As I've said before, I have no evidence that any member of CSM 8 leaked information to their alliances.
---
I *will* tell you that the CSM members that were part of large alliances were expected to faithfully represent their bosses. I'll give an example of this: as CSM8's term was ending, The Mittani pulled me into a Skype call with himself and a couple of other Goon leaders. Their question for me: in my opinion, had mynnna done his utmost to represent and push null-sec interests?
---
That was one of the more uncomfortable conversations I've had in my life, let me tell you.
---
And before you ask, I ultimately told them that yes, as far as I was concerned, mynnna had spent his term advocating for null-sec interests above others.
---
And that would be great, but I don’t have much sympathy for launching a shitty first version (seriously, limiting it to 4:3 aspect ratio in an age when everybody is on 16:9 was fucking retarded) and then not iterating because players don’t use the shitty version.
---
"This will be iterated upon."
---
Can't count the number of times CSM 8 was told that. Five years later, literally nothing we were told this about has been iterated upon.
---
Probably because it would need include some server code in the package which might be quite risky thing to do.
---
The issue is having 15-20billion of capital to get a JF + isk to cover collateral.
---
Shouldn't the non-icelandic devs be learning Icelandic anyway?
---
Like if this was in the US or the UK devs would get shit on for not learning English.
---
Bots now out-ratting Delve, (Branch + Dek), what a time to be alive :-/
---
Hi Proxay. &lt;3
---
Seagull was a big believer in lore, and was a big believer in pushing more lore into the EVE universe and pushing the story-telling aspects of it. This was just spinning up when I was on the CSM but she spent a lot of time telling us what her future plans were for this. This ultimately manifested in the various stories that sprung up in EVE over the next couple of years, notably Caroline's Star.
---
I was disappointed that none of these stories were ultimately concluded in a satisfying way, but by that time, I'd been off the CSM for years.
---
They barely made a dent in the pie chart
---
This special spawn has no bearing on the situation. You can enter the room from t3 up. Most pvpers only run t3 because a pvp fit generally can't always handle the t5 spawns anyways.
---
Not specifically, no. We were told horror stories as our terms started about things previous CSMs had done to breach the NDA, but nothing specific was ever shared with us.
---
The closest I got to a concrete story about CCP NDA-breaking was I heard from several people independently that Ankh stole a USB stick full of CCP code and shared it with a potential employer. And that was why she was banned from EVE. I don't know if it's true or not, though.
---
I believe initiative are heavily involved in botting aren't they.
---
On the topic of lore, do you have any insight as to why Tony Gozales got sacked and the EVE novels discontinued?
---
They did, and then claimed they fixed it, gave everyone SP and kept the cutrent system.
---
It's a good question. See my reply above about devs mostly concentrating on single-player aspects of the game for my answer to that one.
---
Is CCP blinded by the glory of massive sov battles to drive EVE player attraction and retention? Yes yes yes. To a very unhealthy level. CCP's marketing strategy has been "And then it goes viral!" for **years**. It's akin to your retirement strategy being "And then I win the lottery."
---
Keep in mind that you have like 30km web range, and you need to be really agile to switch from diving to tackle something and burning back to help your fleet to deal with incoming tackle. In this particular fight having 10mn will not help to survive against orthrus / kiki...
---
tl;dr looks like theorycrafting in a vacuum i'm afraid :)
---
good ecm pilot is a key to winnig eve ,-)
---
Well, already you have a bunch of groups overstating their involvement in small gang, lowsec and the like and you yourself specifically stated that you want to keep the adds as thruthful as possible. 
---
Just because some nullsec blob corp roams into lowsec once a month, doesnt mean they have any business ticking that box. Another idea would be to prioritise areas of operation. I.e. you rank them and if you only have the lowsec box ticked, you get shown before people that have 5 different areas of operation ticked.
---
No. It's not a charge.
---
why do you think you will be banned?
---
maybe in some specialized comps with logi and a big buffer, but generally just not really doable 
---
we only really use hyena when we're flying retri/jackdaw/1x hyena gangs vs horde etc. and 10mn would definitely not work there, need the 5mn speed + agility like micky says
---
I remember years and years ago when I began playing Eve how interesting it was to have prolific options to make money. Mostly, I remember actually solo pirating in low and null, and small corps doing well out in NPC null, that weren't part of alliances, that were real nuisances to some of the bigger groups. Not because they set out to be, just because it was easy to find content. I adored that Eve because I could log on and have fun, whether I had an hour or 10. Undock, fly around, probably find something to do.
---
I came back to the game a couple of weeks ago, after many years of a break, and it is shocking to me how difficult it is to just fly around solo and find fun fights. Everyone sits tethered to some structure, and engaging them is suicide. Maybe there's a smart way to go about it that I'm not aware of. Low sec seems borderline dead and ransoming just isn't a thing at all anymore.
---
I haven't logged on in a week or so now because, as someone who isn't interested in joining a huge alliance, and isn't interested in the PvE, I just dont see what the game offers me anymore. That makes me sad.
---
I'm sorry that you got so much flak. I was quite vocal about it at the time which was how I ended up talking to E1.
---
He convo'd me and we had a long chat and sent a few mails back and forth.
---
As I said before he had all the traits of a psychopath. He truly believed that he was doing no wrong and that it was just a bit of fun.
---
It wasn't until it became apparent to him to that the majority of people were against him that the talk about being blackmail by the goons appeared out of nowhere.
---
I've already stayed that I didn't believe him however apparently I might be wrong.
---
Did you ever here any rumours about him being involved with the goons / SA Forums at some level?
---
I can't decide, the drifter response BS or apollo tyrannis?
---
Yeah, they should be much more expensive, I agree.
---
lol PanFam wont field their supers and titans again against Imperium, if there are tidi fights its going to be 100% subcaps + HAW dreads
---
Given the current state of Eve, what do you think keeps the current playerbase still subbed -- gameplay, lore, or just camaraderie and habit?
---
If CCP made changes to rejuvenate dead gameplay styles, do you think the players would come, or is there an extra carrot needed before old dogs will play fetch again?
---
(There's a part of me that occasionally thinks "if something can draw cass back into the game, I'm in," but for now I continue to be happy to win the game and watch from afar.)
---
Lost over 100+ ships
---
Honestly this is mostly wrong in my opinion but then I probably missed any office drama if there was any. There was no 5 minute cut and no horrible morale around that I could see. Instead it was mostly a mix of myself and CCP prawn shitting ourselves because we were still fairly new while the almighty Zond was away in paternity leave. Personally that's why I believe the video was what it was, because we were relying on our past of making videos as players rather then Devs, we were going off fresh memories of our game play and we're just excited to make something we'd always wanted to make but didn't have the tools too. I forget Dev names after so long but shout out to the team involved, Tony, Mike &amp; Solvi and all the ccpers we recorded for the voice overs. P.S. the titans aren't shooting the damn station, they're shooting a dread, there's no secret message or leaking future releases there, just my dumb lazy ass! - ex-ccp Loxy
---
It wasn't always like this.  We live in an outrage culture.  #MeToo, #[color]LivesMatter...everyone's up in arms about how shitty the world is, apparently.  And the biggest gaming demographic (pasty white male basement dwellers) didn't have anything to be outraged about...
---
until now.  And it's a cottage industry on Youtube.  Gaming community "influencers" getting zillions of hits by acting like their human rights are being abused when a video game doesn't work out the way they wish it had.  And all the idiots follow.
---
As a newbie to EVE, what other gametypes are possible, that are being ignored?
---
The only copy of it was lost when the boot.ini file was deleted by mistake.
---
got blobbed too and cap dropped on so
---
v0v  There are people I liked in CCP (Falcon, Guard, Bettik, Affinity, Rise, Masterplan, Unifex, Pokethulu, Eterne, FoxFour, Gargant, Goliath, Grimmi, karkur, Manifest, Navigator, Mimic, Mimic's husband whose name I forget, Paradox, Peligro, Phantom, Punkturis, Sisyphus, Xhagen, Veritas, others) and people I didn't much care for (Fozzie, SoniClover, Arrow, Ytterbium, a few others).
---
The people I didn't much like, I had reasons for not liking them, and vice versa. If you have specific questions, ask them and I'll answer them.
---
Fozzie and I got along professionally but neither of us liked the other much. I suspect he thinks I was arrogant and that I didn't know as much about the game as I thought I did. And I think the same about him.
---
Seagull and I got along professionally really well (at the time, we were nearly equal in terms of responsibility to our respective companies) and I liked her and her vision of the game a lot. But she was the wrong EP for EVE. Too nice of a person, not political enough, not ruthless enough.
---
Short of a complete rebuild from Senior management on down, it seems like EVE is dead in the water.
---
&gt; Money for Pirates, ISK for Free
---
&gt;    
---
&gt; Now for the new deployable. The collective term is Encounter Surveillance System, or ESS. Let's start with a quick tl;dr version, refer to the rest of the text for further details. After 1.1, players receive 95% of a bounty income in Null Sec. An active ESS in a system changes the direct payout value to 80%, but further 20% is stored in a system-wide pool that can be accessed through the ESS. This additional bounty payment can rise to 25% over time. So post-1.1, players have the choice to either skip using an ESS and get 95% bounty value, or use ESS and generate 100% up to 105% of bounty value, but have a portion of it be at risk.
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/more-deployables-from-super-friends
---
Oh god.
---
I was a newbie when all the E1 drama went down so I didn't understand most of it, but I do remember reading you post on it and thinking it was really well written. That post made me go back and read a bunch of your previous blog posts, which ended up being a big help in me really getting Eve for the first time. So thanks for that, its probably a big reason I'm still playing.
---
If I knew, I would have written about it long ago.
---
CCP has apparently decided that those two types of players are their hope for EVE to maintain its stable profitability and the rest of us don't matter too much in that regard or are too much trouble to cater to.
---
BOTMURDER TIME
---
Thanks for the feedback; I figured as much but a guy can dream XD
---
 I noticed you mentioned in a reply that starting threads and such is mostly innafective at getting CCPs attention and approval. What would be the best way for someone to get their attention on a feature individually, as a group, and as an employee? 
---
(I have an interest in presenting stuff to CCP on the topic of Mobile structures and Small Citadels, but I'm not sure if there is a way to directly contact someone at CCP or to wait for a CSM member that might be for it)
---
How long do you think will Eve last?  
---
And is it still a good thing to be playing as a new Player now?
---
Why was Veritas hailed publicly as an engineering genius but it seems, from your stories, that he had a hard time getting what he needed within the company?
---
I see, thanks for the comment!  In that case, do you tend towards Keres (the classic BSB roam comp) as your go-to EAS?  Or do you guys just swap between Keres/Kitsune/Hyena based on teh comp you're bringing?
---
what about eagles
---
I'm going to assume you mean devs here. If you mean something else, tell me and I'll answer.
---
Still there dev: Masterplan. He's just one of those quiet geniuses that gets shit done. I can't say enough nice things about him. He's amazing. Honorable mention: Affinity. Keep fighting the good fight, girl. o7
---
Departed dev: Veritas, without question. He was infuriating to me sometimes, but also a genius (though a much louder one, heh). He made a habit of diving into EVE's most impossible code challenges and just solving them. Honorable mention: Pokethulu or Manifest. Losing the two of them were two of the more brain-damaged mistakes that CCP has ever made. Pokethulu in particular was amazing. I've never seen a man do more marketing with less money. The fact that EVE's daily player numbers started dropping when he left is no coincidence.
---
You’re not a very good judge of character are you ?
---
A dev that is also a hs pvper
---
Thats when INIT will finally reveal their plan to attack Local
---
So like me, they just use their Titans as jump freighters?  That's a pity.
---
Since DUST 514 got killed so early, were there any more plans for it? We've seen the PvE Drone Infestation Gamemode that never came into the game but it doesn't seem like it's all they had in plans 
---
And also, was the DUST 514's developement as bad as we heard it was?
---
The more people honor the ransom, the better, then more people will actually pay them.
---
Like if ransomware deleted all the persons stuff anyways even after paying, nobody would pay, and they'd go out of business. Same concept. Well done.
---
holy shit
---
great vid! once the terrible disco started i couldnt hang though.... DONT do the hustle xD
---
Who's that ruggedly handsome bomber pilot in there?
---
Hyena+bomber is best combo. Having 600dps out of a frigate with some decent alpha is nice against cruiser+ targets with a hyena and TP (on the bomber). Was also hitting the sabre's pretty nicely as well (950-1500 per hit)
---
As someone who is going to soldier on, do you think there can be any hope for CSM15? Or should we just abandon the concept of the CSM, since it appears to be a wasted effort?
---
1. Keep gaming. I'll be gaming when they pull the keyboard away from my dead fingers. One thing about not playing EVE? You get lots of time to play some *amazing* games that are out there, though there *is* a lack of good multiplayer games these days. But in the single player realm? Freakin' *amazing* things are happening. Subnautica, The Return of the Obra Dinn, Rebel Galaxy, and The Witcher III are all incredible gaming experiences that I'll remember my whole life.
---
2. I actually occasionally consider starting up a quiet blog again somewhere, just kind of chatting about life and my opinions of things out in the world. The impulse doesn't last long, though. ;-)
---
Bro, you forgot about all the sick new skins they're cranking out. Just kidding I actually like skins, but I'd trade them all away for actual quality content.
---
&gt; See, here's the thing: CCP devs are not allowed to play the game in leadership roles of large null-sec alliances. So they don't really understand how those alliances work. And they simply don't have a good feel for the control that operates in those alliances.
---
It seems to me like, in order to not risk being identified on comms and the like, EVE devs either fail background checks or avoid even trying to join them in order to not accidentally end up in leadership positions.
---
Does that comport with your experience?
---
On the other hand, I feel like I should note that, when I flew with the goons, for awhile I had only four ships in my hangar: a scimitar, a guardian, and ... I dunno, a caracal and something?  (Logi made it really easy to have a low capital investment, though.)
---
Sooner or later that little brother is going to figure that out and when they do I can't wait to watch the fireworks.
---
1. https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/3h3ylh/ccp_has_a_great_plan_for_reinvigorating_eve_that/
---
2. Player-sourced Localization. I've mentioned it in another reply.
---
3. It's amazing how many ideas just rattle around CCP HQ just waiting for a champion to come along and make it happen. The idea of variable warp speeds had apparently been suggested two previous times (and been judged to be impossible) before Masterplan just solved it.
---
Yes, there were definitely strong hints about what became citadels were coming years before they happened. And going back to my answer #1. The first year that Seagull was EP and was pushing local conflict, it was *amazing* the lengths players would go to ignore what CCP clearly wanted to happen. Highly relevant: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/3c0hi9/almost_absurdly_funny/
---
&gt; how to motivate people with soft power.
---
Could you elaborate on that, pelase?
---
One can assume one of three things:
---
They are doing an excellent job of self-reporting and purging botters from within their ranks.
---
They are doing a terrible job of self-reporting and botters do so in relative safety due to the population density of Delve with little fear of being reported.
---
They have magically found a way to prevent their members from botting.
---
Idk. Tough call.
---
As someone who has only been playing Eve since 2016, I feel like I need to say this again as a reminder:
---
&gt;Holy fucking shit, Incarna (the Walking In Stations update - July 2011) decimated the game in a way that it has not recovered from...
---
[Source.](https://eve-prism.com/?view=statistics) Scroll to "Daily Average Server Online" at the bottom and click Play. [edit: It's an animated graph of Eve's daily active users over time, along with a non-linear regression formula.]
---
All NC. seems to be able to do is batphone PH so...
---
The real botting alliances are in Branch. Maybe they should make a pit stop on the way...
---
Logi ships and books would skyrocket on the market.
---
erotica1 is reasonably recent history in the grand scheme of things, that or I am just old?
---
thats a good idea! :)
---
Think it would depend on the comp. If i'm in a bomber, or we go to space that is known for ramjags, its normally Hyena over the Keres. If we end up needing to fight cerbs/caracals (other long range stuff), the  Keres is preferable;.
---
FOOL now the devs will remove this feature
---
The russian voice acting is spot on for a 'villain' style third party to enter and change the ball game. Still one of the best trailers. I've love to see that extra minute.
---
Not bad, not bad at all. Kinda catchy
---
Hey W0wbagger, thanks for the kind words. :-) And yeah, you and I seemed to be orbiting very close circles for a long while but never quite managed to land in the same alliance, hee.
---
Should’ve fought harder amirite
---
do realize how much animosity there is for PL and NC in the average goon line member?  I will happily slow boat  travel across the entire map multiple times a day for a chance to shit on them regardless of who they are fighting.
---
Us too, Maybe I assumed too much because you're in TAPI.
---
If that is how you like to spend your evenings sure, you do you :joy:
---
Lol if I could figure out how to get to you I would.... lol
---
keres 90%+ of the time for most fights, its just somewhat useless vs horde because horde fights tend to [look like this](https://i.imgur.com/Xq1JQhq.png), the hyena is really strong together with the jackdaw/retri combo
---
keres has amazing utility in most fights that are not as chaotic. fights that don't have 20+ tacklers burning into you so the keres can spread damps onto projecting ships really let it shine and makes it the clear winner
---
anyway, don't want to hijack the thread!
---
even if they did they still wouldn't be able to kill it.
---
Judging by the destroyed vs created metric we need a big war bad it like everyone is playing pve eve right now
---
Wonder if they will be in contention for Goons war!?!?
---
I wonder how well-recieved something like that would be. Everything else in EVE has a counter or plan for it, but what happens when you lose because another game you can't influence is lost?
---
but then they would have to undock.
---
Do you work for a polling company?  You left off the most obvious option: there just aren't that many botters in Goons.
---
Bots...Alive...I see wut you did thurrrrr
---
Hey man, no real question here, just appreciated this. I was not a regular reader when you were writing and playing but every time I came across your blog, I always got pulled in. You're very talented, and I'm thinking if it was that fun to read it was probably that fun to write. I hope you get back into it again someday. 
---
Instead of quitting like you (very similar reason, small and solo gameplay deader than a doorknob) I've turned to altoholocism. I'm on my like fifth main now. This is really it though, heh. 
---
~BA
---
&gt; They have magically found a way to prevent their members from botting.
---
I know reading is difficult but just try, ok? Just do your best.
---
Last time they gave out the free SP, I didn’t get it bc my account wasn’t omega for a week. One week since I started playing like 3 years ago and it fell on the day they picked. 
---
I was just on vacation out of the country for two weeks and my omega lapsed. I was going to renew tonight.... and they’ll probably do free SP based on Omega status today again. 
---
Ugh.
---
Their industry guys thank them.
---
Worst add: injectors. I respect what they did for CCP's bottom line but what they've done to the game is tragic, and criminal.
---
Best add: the redone Crimewatch. Say what you will about low-sec, but Crimewatch is keeping the sov life out of low-sec, for which I am very thankful. I might have quit EVE years before now had it not been for the revamped Crimewatch. Wish CCP had done more Crimewatch-level rewrites of other systems in EVE. To their credit, they're trying, though in a poor lackluster way with things like the war dec changes.
---
Worst idea not implemented: for some odd reason, nothing's springing to mind on this one. I know for a fact that CCP devs have proposed terrible ideas in my hearing but for some reason I can't recall any of them.
---
Best idea not implemented: alliance level certificates and training packages. ie, a certificate that you could give a new player that would give them a training plan to follow.
---
A little bit of despair about this from Veritas is all I ever heard. I think most devs just accept it as a price to be paid.
---
I would just eliminate colossal and enormous anoms and not make any rock sizes bigger than 800,000 m3. If that doesn't force people to spread out, get rid of the large, too.
---
CCP as an organization probably feels like they've put a ton of resources into this for almost no return. It's not like it's a big draw of new recruits. It's also not like it's a profit center (quite the opposite).
---
Everything in CCP gets passed through the money filter eventually.
---
You invoked magic.  I don't believe in magical thinking.
---
Path of Exile did a clever integration where you get twitch chat in-game but use obs for media
---
Who knows... maybe that's where they're headed...
---
The client can be decompiled super easy and you get full source code. The only thing we don't have is the server code. People have been doing python injection for years and I'm almost certain they still are.
---
English is spoken by roughly 1.5 billion people on Earth, icelandic by less than 350.000 people (according to bad maths after a Wikipedia reading). It's a whole different order of magnitude and international influence, sadly. Icelandinc is believed by some people and linguists to be a slowly dying language, due to many icelandic people speaking other languages -especially english.
---
but haven't they put no resources into it, which was always the problem?
---
&gt; You left off the most obvious option: there just aren't that many botters in Goons.
---
&gt; I don't believe in magical thinking.
---
One of these two statements is a lie. I’ll let you pick, since this is your deflection from me pointing out your deficiency in literacy.
---
Yes. Quite a lot of times, actually.
---
CCP was terrified that if they did DUST 514 as a PC release, EVE would die, everyone would move to DUST, and they'd be no better off. We heard this a couple of times
---
about the risk adverse nullsec fights? yeah.  majorly triggered &lt;.&lt; 
---
the insane shit i've done to try to bait a fight. only for them to get scared when reinforcements are reported on their intel and they dock in a citadel in system (cause citadels are in EVERY SYSTEM.  multiple.....)
---
gotten in trouble more than once for some of the baits i've come up with (Leadership: "Dock that shit up now, that is to insane"  in my defense, when drunk. everything seems like a good idea. beware when the FC has me as "hot drop back up" and i'm trying to get rid of a dread, cause chances are the dread isn't fit like your hoping.)
---
triggered about calling peeps botting alliances,  na. just want the record set that all the coalitions have groups struggling to fight internal bots.  Imperium, Test, Panfam, Frat.   they all say the same, and all try much the same methods to fight them (at least externally).
---
That's a lot of drones
---
I can't speak to Legion. It was on the drawing board long after I left the CSM and nobody ever told me anything about it.
---
Definitely not goons though.
---
Well that's good news +1
---
It's the place that would have rivaled Delve and Branch for NPC bounties had FRT not been getting all their bots blown up by TEST.
---
You seem like a fun player.  I look forward to meeting you on the battlefield.
---
But you are a botter?
---
In my last few years playing eve; i was almost exclusively logi. And i would've loved this. Seeing who won the health race would've been excellent.
---
That can be petitioned as an exploit.  If it's to decloak.
---
another one
---
Hmmmmm.
---
Weird deflects but ok.
---
No, I’m not a botter.
---
hopefully i see you when i'm not in a Revelation with civilian guns (I'VE BEEN TRYING TO KILL THIS THING FOR 1.5 YEARS. WHY WONT IT DIE)
---
Best Fleet Goku Fleet! One of the best nights in eve I've ever experienced!
---
You should refresh your memes. These are stale.

---
working out well for you guys, please keep coming
---
Pretty sure he's referring to the extensive memorandum they released in response, which pretty much covered what players were wanting the game to be and enshrined it. 
---
https://www.eveonline.com/de/article/nullsec-development-rules-and-guidelines
---
They were trying to implement a lot of these with fozzie sov, but then went right against them with Citadels, Rorquals, and capital changes more recently.
---
So Devs kinda "Gatekeep" discussions behind a trivia question?
---
That's the kind of thing a botter would say though.
---
It's advised that you can use a T1 frigate. This is nothing SP and allows you to hunt, explore, and harvest gas/ore. If you're an omega clone, train into a Covert Ops cloak and run around in an astero exploring for a bit to learn the lay of the land, and then start jumping other explorers. Once you've done this, then you'll have a fairly good understanding of surviving and thriving in wspace. Get in with a wh group as soon as you can though, this'll help you have other people with you
---
What's 'extensive onboarding' ?
---
A general code of conduct / NDA doesn't sound unreasonable?
---
OK, EVE history lesson. You have to understand that in the two years leading up to the release of Incarna, there were almost no features added to the game that the player base wanted. You simply can't imagine the hatred most EVE players had for Incarna if you weren't there. Some of the kinder comments about Incarna revolved around the term Space Barbie.
---
A cruel man would say: take the worst aspects of toxic masculinity, add huge doses of entitlement and fear of change, stir well. That's where the player base was when Incarna was released. It was not received well.
---
Now add to this toxic soup strong rumors that CCP was looking into gold ammo and using money to buy ships or other advantage in game... then a CCP newsletter that comes out that seems to completely confirm the very worst rumors? Then have Hilmar not only reconfirm the rumors, but strongly defend those actions?
---
Again, you can't imagine if if you weren't there. There were zero EVE players that I talked to at the time that weren't furious about it. Tens of thousands of players unsubbed. We'll probably never know the real number.
---
Jon Lander became the Senior/Executive Producer of EVE during this time. If he'd made a wrong move, EVE would have been dead, dead, dead as fried chicken. Jon turned it around. He saved the game by listening to the players, listening to what they wanted, and then did something even more important: he delivered.
---
Had there been no Jon Lander, the EVE servers would have closed sometime in late 2013.
---
Is it?
---
I wouldn’t know, since I’m not a botter.
---
I assume though from your expertise in the matter that you are.
---
That's also the kind of thing a botter would say.  You're giving yourself away.
---
It was trendy for a few years. Soon, it'll be gone but EVE will still have it.
---
The fact that you cannot even begin to access the interesting parts of EVE until you go through months to *years* of being unable to do any of the common activities people discuss or anything that is actually fun doesn't help

This is more of a solo fit, but it's not like you're anchoring on FC in a drake. And hey, if you compact some mods and throw a skirmish link on it, your FC might be ok with you! Not recommended for roams with more than a handful of pilots.

Did they just... not expect people to care the games were tied-in anymore? WTF?

I disagree: it really was always like this, at least for games, but the internet makes it easier for it to be visible to more than just the people at the bar.

Even people who know better fall into the trap from time to time because it's just that inviting.

Hello,

Do you have more information from the aftermath of the summer of rage about Wis future ? They never updated It since, do you think they could reboot It at some point or It is promised to stay the same until the end ?

---
The CSM needs another revolution similar to the one The Mittani led for CSM 6. Something to completely change the dynamic.
---
I actually regret never having been on a CSM with him. That would have been a hoot. The two of us together, with maybe Trebor or Mike Azariah to referee?
---
I'll tell you this: CSM 7 getting rid of the officers is now shown to be a horrifically bad idea I thought it was when I first heard it. Without clear public leadership, the CSM loses its ability to drive a narrative.
---
Owww,did I make you angry ? Sorry 'bout that.
---
What do you expect, harassing renters without them calling Mommy NC. ? 
---
You had a choice : relocate elsewhere, wait for NC to leave and start again, or call for help. We all know what you did, and as I said, I don't blame you for it. But don't act like you DID NOT.
---
Also harassing renters is funny because they don't fight back right ?
---
I won eve a while back and keep thinking of returning but never do.

What would you need to happen, to play again?
---
Again, I’ll take your word for it since I’m not a botter and you seem to have deep knowledge of it.

Though I am worried that you’re not really equipped to keep going in this conversation. Do you want me to find you some floaties before we go in the deep end?

bleep bleep
---
The ESS could have been a legitimately good thing for the game, but they implemented it in just about the stupidest way possible. It was virtually all downside, until people broke it by putting it in anoms, then it just stopped being a point of interest for small gangs.
---
"Hey kids, how do you feel about putting a fifth of your earning in a piggy bank so that pirates can come by every so often and steal it? All for the massive upside of 5% more isk and marking yourself for every roaming gang in nullsec."

But test and goons are white to each other
---
What is it with this community that always downplays the out of game harassment that goes on? Yours is not the first and I’m sure won’t be the last. Is it some desire to one up the previous asshole that did out of game harassment? It’s like the community wants these kinds of things to happen.
---
Could you elaborate what revolution Mittani did for CSM6?
---
Very interesting thread!
---
I was going to ask the E1 question... but that has already been done.
---
What would you do differently if you could go back to the start of your CSM term?
---
This fit here is really good except for small gang you switch the MJD for a microwarp drive.
---
Pretty much everything at this point except hard-core PvE and the biggest sov-level PvP battles.
---
Small gang? Dead. Small alliances? Dead. Lower-end PvE (incursions, for example)? Dead. Solo play? Super dead. Small scale manufacturing? Super dead. Lots of other things: dead dead dead.

There just aren't that many viable ways to play EVE right now.

&gt; Ankh stole a USB stick full of CCP code and shared it with a potential employer. And that was why she was banned from EVE. I don't know if it's true or not, though.
---
I can confirm this to be true, and it's why she got banned.. I don't remember it exactly but I think she used a USB drive to copy a bunch of data from CCP pc's while we were there for the summit. IIRC it was in the evening when there were just a few people left in the office but all the CSM related stuff was going on in the meeting room near the front desk, but we were walking around all the time to get snacks and that's when she did it. They found out quickly but didn't tell us until after the summit.
---
And then we got mazz the AZN meme queen as replacement &lt;3
---
&gt; CCP's marketing strategy has been "And then it goes viral!" for **years**. It's akin to your retirement strategy being "And then I win the lottery."
---
CCP do seem to have survived more on luck and goodwill than most other companies. I fear it will take them losing it all before they learn from their mistakes in that regard...
---
The first obviously was them sneaking in and making some games that went nowhere.
---
Care to share all the details of the Space Colonization plan that you remember?
---
Eh, after this, I kind of want to disappear off the radar. I think this AMA is doing a good job of sharing my experiences.

But it’s not an exploit unless it is used to lag a client.

Just to decloak is not an exploit.

It's not "tribal knowledge" is it.  I've petitioned such a thing in the past, successfully.  Who's to know whether it's to lag the client or not.

Both of those can be (and were, so far as I could tell) true at the same time.

I should have worded that better.
---
From my memory of an old AT, he was hailed *by CCP* as an engineering genius. Why would they not give the guy what he needed?
---
Do you think that a new team of devs could take over EVE and "make it great again"?
---
Basically CCP selling EVE to a new company without any of the currently involved devs/management/support going to the new company.
---
If so, is there an existing company out there that would come to mind?
---
I looked it up last year. The BR tool is now in the same sort of shape as CCP's communication strategy, so clicking on the link the numbers will be ridiculous, but check out the count I made in my post.

---
TLDR: Legacy alone outnumbered "All Of Eve" in supers and titans.
---
Now, nobody fights to extinction. Defeated will just pay winner some money or faction fortizars. There is so much space in EVE that there is no incentive to take it. I think last alliance that was evicted and failed to raise from that was FCon. Which is shame, I heard that they were good people.
---
&gt; I just wanted to ask some of you industrialists how you got into Trading/Manufacturing and what is the best way to start producing and selling my own goods.
---
I started with making fuel blocks in the forge. It's a steady 10-20% profit margin, or more if you're good at market pvp. It just requires a lot of work moving stuff around but that's all standard industry gameplay. 
---
It's low-cost to get started. Just pick a fuel block type with good margins, if you're in the forge then nitrogen is a good choice, buy a few 10/20 bpos off the contract search for 25m each, and start cranking out jobs in one of the many structures around Jita. 
---
Protip: pay somebody to haul your bulky items. It's way cheaper and safer than hauling it yourself.
---
As of 2021 EVE time, there might be a private message up there in the... Jesus... 215 replies I have waiting for me to look at. I haven't looked yet.
---
Wow, that gives off a pretty bad vibe...
---
I would have loved that kind of rewrite. Seagull seemed to get the game more than many other devs seem to have done.
---
Curious:  am I the only person in Eve that DNGAF about anything Triglavian?
---
There are so many other things, of all sizes, that would dramatically improve gameplay, that I just don't 'get' the Triglavian push.
---
I think I might be considered a target for it, but it is a total miss for me.
---
It had 300k active monthly on average through it's lifetime.
---
I thought part of the reason we hadn't gotten that yet was because POS code is so interconnected with how corporations function that they needed to get rid of them first. Am I misunderstanding something here or should they have don it the other way around?

the 3 main reasons why i will probably do what I do every war - not fucking bother. not to mention, fleets during war time are significantly less interesting or fun than peace time fleets.
---
I can't decide if this is a serious question or not, but I'll try answering it.
---
Your question, whether you realize it or not, is perspective as an EVE player (and presumably not as a customer of CCP's other games, notably Valkyrie). I've said this a lot and it's true: CCP has tried various levels of investment in EVE but they all give the same return. A $2 investment in EVE gives them $3.25. A $5 investment in EVE gives them $3.25.
---
CCP has been trying for almost a decade now to push EVE into a higher tier of logged in players, with absolutely no success. So what can they do?
---
The logical thing to do is to try again with other games, which is what they've been doing. That effort started in 2015 or so. So that's why and when.
---
"How much debris will cause lag? Well, there is no hard answer for that as this is highly dependent on too many factors to formulate a definition that can always be applied. Common sense will need to be applied (and GMs have certain protocols to use to determine if it causes lag or not, to make sure that all GMs use the same benchmark)."
---
Hmmmmm.  I wonder what that benchmark is... oh, number of items on grid.
---
&gt;Neither of them responded to me.
---
This has been my experience trying to get CCP guests for my podcast, I don't know how Matterall does it, but whatever juice he's got I don't have.
---
Mittens has told members to not report botters if they are within goons.
---
It won't be the same without you Dave.

---
You stated if it’s used to decloak, then it’s an exploit. That is not the case.
---
I did not refute that lagging a client is the problem. It is, as evidenced by the GM reply.
---
Did you watch the Meta Show on Saturday?  He said to report them but not to "hurf and blurf" (is that an Americanism?) about it.
---
While there really can't *actually* be one,  Icelandic is considered one of the worst (read least valuable) languages to learn for almost any reason. Barely anyone speaks it natively, and those natives pretty much have to know English fluently in modern times. It's also hard as all hell.
---
I assume you mean "besides the CSM". Because the obvious answer is "the CSM".
---
Other than that, though, no. Not during our term. Things would go from them, to us, to the players. And sometimes, they skipped us. I can remember a few times being surprised by this or that announcement at EVE Vegas or Fanfest. I can't remember specifics, but it happened once or twice.
---
Nahh there don’t , all the ratting and mining is done without bots or broadcast , goons would never do that
---
As someone who works closely with developers without actually having access to the source code, I agree with what your saying and am pretty amazed to hear CCP is managed this way.
---
Although, you'll always hear people bitching about various things around the office and to trusted colleagues. Part of me wonders if there is a different side. The end result is a "working" product (not bug free), so there is a drive somewhere to create something.
---
Could they have handled it differently? I... don't think so. A CEO has a responsibility to generate money for his or her shareholders.
---
owo
---
&gt; Mittens has told members to not report botters if they are within goons.
---
literally the very opposite of what he said in the fireside on Saturday.
---
your spies are terrible if they told you something contrary to that.
---
Well, my information is five years out of date. Perhaps things have improved in terms of what they get for their money?
---
I can say that I don't approve of and am disappointed with how they've spent that money the last three years.
---

---
Hey! I don't know if you are aware of it but there was a very EVE-like game called Perpetuum online, which basically started out as an eve clone with robots, WASD movement and cover.
---
 It is now kind of open source and there is a projekt called "Open Perpetuum" which seeks to develop it further, for free. I won't link it here, as that might be advertisement (idk, they don't make any money of it, they're just players), but I'm sure you can google it.
---
Due to a small population it is entirely about small alliances, but they are actively re-developing and balancing features and implementing new ones.
---
Might we worth to check it out for you :)
---
Again, I don't make any money from it, the original devs get like 5 bucks or something and it is being developed by ex-players.
---
This question has come up a couple of times now, and without being on the CSM again, I have no basis for comparison.
---
I am disheartened that the relationship has clearly shifted from the CSM being partially a watchdog group to a CSM onboarding and Code of Conduct on top of the NDA. I wouldn't join the CSM under these circumstances even if I were a huge fan of EVE. I wouldn't want to put my family's livelihood at risk, if nothing else.
---
https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-06-23-ccp-greed-is-good
---
After T20 that shit just wouldn't fly, like any known dev in any well null bloc or well any alliance of note is quickly gonna lead to a high degree of suspicion as much as you might say how cares the issue for CCP isn't if the devs cheat but if the majority of players suspect they do it's gonna reflect massively negative on the login numbers.
---
No, putting hundreds of objects on grid in that manner IS to decloak.  Lag maybe a side-effect.  I think you're splitting hairs (and so is CCP to be honest).
---
Thanks for the new tunes Ministry of Truth! Hopefully Mind1 gets it in the rotation
---
It simply could not be more important. Hilmar itself disparaged CSMs 6 and 7 as being too null-sec heavy and not providing a wide enough basis of opinion.
---
Without other frames of reference in the game being represented, there's a real risk that CCP will assume that the other play styles not being represented aren't important or can be ignored.
---
yes it will, given that i don't really bother turning up to wars. it'll be very much the same.
---
i mean, i'd love to - if they were actually fun and/or interesting. however, they aren't.
---
In my experience with 3 battles against roaming wormholers so far (our of 5 i've participated in) once we either start organizing defense or ball up enough people incidentally they pull back and sit on their hole at 0 and then start rolling it closed. And it just devolves into a stalemate where we just watch them from 200km off unable to actually do anything while they roll it closed.
---
This kind of thing eventually led to an incident i was not part of but heard about where they chased them into the wormhole but it was still rolled shut and FC had to use his combat probes to scan them out.
---
Sad Face.
---
Wow. That *is* really stupid.
---
There are tons of folks that run through our space every day killing stuff.  Get with them and enjoy what small gang meta exists in our game at the moment.  We are, essentially, untouchable even if the entire game bore down upon us BUT it would be an amazing fight and more content than the game has seen in a long time.    
---
Tuskers is an amazing small gang group for example...
---
I don't have to. She made her plans public not once, but many times. It was a failure to deliver that doomed her, not the failure of the vision.
---
The things she wanted to do came *after* the basic building blocks that she never completed like the new corp/alliance interfaces, new structures, new industry, and the like. She had some pretty nifty plans for Space Colonization, but of course she never got anywhere close to delivering on those ideas.
---
This was a few years ago tops and the number of reported bots seems to have dropped dramatically. Only to now have goons being told to report them, nice aboutface on the topic.
---
At least they're trying I guess, but man I have absolutely 0 faith in CCP. Any change they make has always had a negative impact on my fun in eve.
---
I've read every single question and response you've made and I have to say that my faith in the game is shaken. I started in 2006 and have played on and off over the years. I have two accounts. I tried the Nullsec Alliance  lifestyle, I've been a Lowsec pirate, and currently I'm a lone wolf in my own little Corp.
---
For players like me, who view a billion ISK as a huge sum of money, do you see a future in the game for us? Are my only options limited to Wspace or Nullsec?
---
Are there more "casual" players such as myself than hardcore types?
---
I don't disagree but personally I would still learn the language. And I would find it weird unless the company has a massive proportion os their employees from outside Iceland
---
mine too, friend. mine too.
---
Was CCP trying to do something with tidi? Was lower tidi on their priority list or they totaly ignored problem?
---
Wow I had forgotten what the narratives were back then. I think I saw what they wanted when I made TC in fountain , we lived the local conflict dream for a while. But I think human nature is too hard to fight against. Nobody wants to lose and when it starts happening to you, that’s when you ask the bigger boys to come help, groups we ‘local conflicted’(bullied) looked outside for help. Near the end we too looked for help from bigger boys to hold back the Imperium, as they regrew their confidence. In the end I took it out back and shot it rather than join a coalition. RIP the local conflict dream, I honestly don’t think there’s anyone smart enough to create game mechanics compelling enough to counteract human nature.
---
If the RL economy kills EVE, it will be because the constant inflation of PLEX prices in game drives some of the key hard-core PvE players out of the game. There's no possible way I can imagine someone sanely paying for 50 accounts, yet I assume account numbers on that scale are fairly commonplace across null-sec (much less some of the really big numbers I've heard, people with hundreds of accounts).
---
If things can be kept more or less static, I can see EVE surviving fairly well as Space EverQuest for another five years, with player populations dropping 5-10% per year over that time. At that point, EVE will hit a crisis point where there aren't enough active players to maintain the in-game economy.
---
And this explains why we don't have an AT this year :(
---
What was your "style of gameplay?" What 6 month period of this gameplay for you was your favorite and what changes in the game most directly killed that gameplay?   
---
I've certainly felt this a while for what I enjoyed most about eve. The gameplay never dies suddenly, it slowly fades out of do-ability, so no one really feels it until its gone-gone.
---
The question "Why does x suck" has 2 answers in eve
---
It was overpowered, CCP nerfed it into the ground, promised to iterate on it and never did
---
It was released underpowered, CCP promised to iterate on it and never did
---
The answer to this is number 1
---
I've honestly never given it much thought.
---
pretty sure "it's ccp's fuckin' job" has always been the stance, nothing has changed.
---
you can report bots all you want, or don't want. that doesn't change that the only bots that will get banned are the ones ccp wants to ban.
---
I may be a bit late but I wanted to ask one thing simple. If you are quitting Eve after today and could go back, would you do it all again?
---
It’s just baffling how much of a industrial machine this chunk of space is. The craziest part is that exports from the area are low meaning all that wealth is sitting in hangers waiting for a fight
---
you keep saying Space Everquest, what do you mean by that?
---
If it's still the same as when he wrote his blog, low sec small gang PvP
---
Sure, tomorrow I'll give you the source code (c#)
---
u/BP_EloKnight would you say this post has aged well? :p
---
I imagine test does, they don't have enemies dropping 100s of structures in their system close to hisec where its hard to secure.
---
Thanks for your kind words. :-)
---
I joined EVE for micro-, small-, and medium-gang action, from fleet sizes of about four to fleet sizes of about 50 or so. That's the thing I loved about EVE, the fact that you can have a largish multi-player battle but still create a situation where every player has to do his or her part for the group to be successful. By contrast, once fleet sizes are past 50, individual members stop having any real impact and I hate that.
---
I'd consider coming back if a place was found for small-gang combats, and an in-game place was found for smaller alliances (250 to 400 people) who could hold small patches of space and yet still be independent of the larger alliances. I'd be OK if they were put in a situation where they could join a larger coalition for a major war -- I loved loved **loved** the fact that Low Sec Voltron manifested and was a maor player in WWB but could still operate independently of the big boys.
---
There are no multiplayer games on the horizon right now that interest me, though that of course could change if something else can give me that same feeling. There are amazing things happening in single-player gaming (examples: Subnautica, The Return of the Obra Dinn, Rebel Galaxy, The Wticher III).
---
I would give my left leg for a multiplayer version of Rebel Galaxy. That game really captured the spirit of what EVE could be for me.
---
I'm pretty sure we could sustain war almost indefinitely at this point.  It's not so much the space, although it is pretty decent, as it is the people out there min-maxing everything every day.  Delve, essentially, is Deklein folded in on itself.
---
third option: it was the baseline in a balance pass and everything that wasn't x got changed such that an unchanged x became obsolete.
---
And when asked about it the dev's at eve Vegas were like. "What? The neocom had colors?"
---
Not about DUST 514 specifically, no. Only that this concept of DUSTies being a major player in EVE battles was apparently alive and well as late as 2015.
---
Everquest is an mmo focused on pve rather than pvp.
---
Remember when eve was a PVP game
---
I wouldn't connect them, but the slippery slope has already happened. That's the thing about massive Rorqual fleets and the like: before injectors, you could make tons of money that way, but it wasn't *instantly scalable* the way it is now.
---
That instant scalability is what is destroying EVE.
---
move to Iceland also makes a lot of people go nope because honestly, it's not a country where you have many options outside of well CCP with a game development background
---
I'm sure they would allow ally marines to defend -- it would be a pretty boring FPS without someone to shoot.
---
It's wrapped around now too, where so little is going on that even a sniff of conflict gets dogpiled to death within a couple weeks.
---

the attribute implants all give 1-5 attribute points that will increase your training speed. the +5s might be a problem as they require cybernetics lv5 but the +3s only require cybernetics 1 which you should be able to train very quickly if you don't already have it.  Search the market for "- basic" and it should pull up all the +3 implants
---
Yep. Sansha, as in Sansha Nation is the correct spelling. Sansa happens to have hit on a Game of Thrones character.
---
yeah that would be a given but a little bit the pilot can do to help would be cool too, even if its just something to slow down the attackers
---
Hey dude, &lt;3, long time no talk to and I hope you're well!
---
What keeps player still subbed? Habit, friends, the sunk cost fallacy, and the hope for that one last hit that will be as good as the hit before. That's why the fights have to get ever bigger: EVE players are building up a tolerance for the drugs.
---
I think if EVE reopened closed parts of the sandbox, that's all they'd have to do. Well, they might have to find a marketing program to tell people it happened. 
---
The thing is, even if CCP deleted the last three years of EVE development and started pushing for smaller alliance acceptance again, they'd still be facing the upper limit of daily users they had in 2011 or so. That said, there's certainly benefits to that given that daily average players was then about double what it is now...
---
Finding a single dev that will champion your idea, which you present to him or her at a player gathering or by joining the CSM.
---
Throw your ammo out the window for extra rate of fire!
---
I think you're overestimating the pressure to learn that language. Other than to circumvent the anecdote that people hide their words with their native tongue around you, everything in Iceland has English written on or near it and everyone knows it. Seriously, everyone.
---
If anything, wanting to learn it to "fit in" would be like trying to obtain an accent to fit in. You'll do just fine without it and you're really just wasting your time to blend in.
---
Of course, learning languages is inherently wonderful, and Icelandic shouldn't be overlooked if you enjoy it. You're just not going to find it pragmatic to know it.
---
If things remain stable as they are now, EVE will stick around another five years, losing about 25-50% of its existing player base over that time. At that point, the in-game economy will threaten to collapse from lack of players to keep it going.
---
When EVE had that few players before, CCP had to support the in-game economy by having key things built by NPCs. If you ever see CCP start to have NPCs providing in-game materials again, you'll know that final crisis period is starting.

Actually, I miss 'Space Cadet' 3D Pinball.

I met and talked to Masterplan at Fanfest last year. We talked about local and his thoughts about it, CCP's (or maybe his) vision and idea for local chat, and the technical limitations in regards to tweaking/changing it. Then some funny stories of him being in OG MC along with Seleene although before both of their time at CCP.
---
Easily was my favorite dev to talk to over the entire event. Dude has a passion for EVE and for programming.
---
Other than what I've already said, I can't provide any more DUST 514 information. You'd want a CPM member to do an AMA for that. ;-)
---
Nothing that blatant that I can point to.
---
This times 1000. New ship comes out? Instant perfect skills for it? Income meta-shifts? Instant re-build. One racial cap now better than another? Just buy into the new cap. So much of the solo/small-gang content is a game of inches, someone with IRL/in-game income to support a 20 injector a year habit can constantly have that 5% edge that makes the difference solo/small-gang.
---
One of the nails in the coffin, relentless shafting the space middle class.
---
Close all regions but Syndicate. Make all stations and outposts in Syndicate freeports. Teleport everyone randomly (with all their stuff) to individual stations and outposts with no respect for putting Goons together or NC together or any of that shit.
---
Delete all alliances and corporations.
---
Announce a month-long free-for-all before the servers close.
---
Clever
---
I can't find my post on it, but sometime in the last year, I theorized that hard-core PvEs and hard-core sov warriors bring in more money, with less drama, and longer subscription times than any other type of player.
---
I've seen nothing since I posted that to sway me from that opinion.
---
&gt;The problem is that vocal users are often wrong at face value
---
Those are not the "vocal users" those are guys who are there to represent the playerbase(and yeah, those are not mutually exclusive, but they're not the *general* vocal user) and go thru some pretty extensive briefing and personal sacrifices to be there. 
---
Also as someone with quite a bit of experience with programmers I can say that the majority of them are complete mongs who think they know way more than they do, *especially* the ones who think laymen can't call their bluffs and get defensive when they do. There is no biggest sign of a fraud than those who refuse to explain their points in a good enough way to convince most reasonable people, we're not speaking advanced cutting edge research here, we're speaking plumbing.
---
Maybe that's the sv babies clouding my judgment but sure sounds like was the case.
---
if you are winning eve can i haz your stuff?
---
I dearly wish that some of the things that made them so hard-core (no supers, limited gang sizes, no local) were offered in a new type of space that included gates.
---
As to wormhole space itself, it's been years since I lived in one so I can't comment intelligently.
---
Giant Secure Containers came along with the Tardis: they’re larger on the inside than they are on the outside.
---
I see peoples in local chat. WH local chat.
---
Server working fine.
---
Its like when they turn on the lights at a bar at the end of the night. You can see everything...
---
1. Rebuilding the corp/alliance/coalition structure in EVE. It's absurd that Netware 4 introduced in 1993 has better organization and security structures than EVE does. How hard would it be to copy something like that and implement it?
---
2. Assuming you mean, what that CCP is doing do I think they should shelve, I'd stop with this Triglavian shit (and to a lesser extent, the balance changes). This is just CCP doing something easy and quick in a pathetic attempt to keep the drug-users addicted that isn't solving EVE's real problems.
---
3. Scrambled, with a little bit of cheese.
---
You don’t want haulers and you don’t want miners [I’m guessing].
---
Your ships are going to come out of the dust between the stars and you’re going to move all your shit around using a wheelbarrow, right?
---
Daily reminder CCP had yet redesigned Throax and Celestis
---
in the video description it's even described that that voice actor wasn't even an eve player. I kinda think they should dox him for a future trailer tbh
---
They probably don't want to promote publicity of influencial community member announcing they're quitting the game, I'm guessing It'll bring the game into question and possibly push out new and old players alike?
---
ironically this sub brings nothing but bashing on hard-core PvErs x.x
---
idk what that is but im happy for u :)
---
It wasn't during my CSM time, but Citadel/Lifeblood was an absolute nuclear weapon tossed into low-sec. It's not a coincidence that every low-sec group of any consequence died over the next few months after that 1-2 punch.
---
At that point, I knew I was done with CCP and EVE.
---
As someone who felt EVE needed more "common enemy" concepts or even just more interesting PvE or even just an interesting event, Triglavians either fell short of a satisfactory outcome or outright failed at all three of my perceived wants.
---
I had very low expectations, VERY LOW, but a Sansha reskin? Bob is disgusted.
---
to be fair that's an awfully low bar to set
---
Thanks for the kind words!
---
Search this thread for "writing contest" for the question about my stuff.
---
I mean, added eve lore is pretty dope imo. not to mention the dominion trailer was a pretty badass video regardless.
---
I think we actually have it all wrong. When is the last time you have even seen an NC character online at all? They would have to "login" would be even more correct.
---
Both. Remote repoing eachother
---
Thank you for your reply. That is a fun idea for a goodbye.
---
BOTS HAVE LIVES!!!

To be precise 240 ships

Small-gang PvP, small-gang PvE, solo industry that's worth a damn, solo PvP, something more like Guild Wars 2 in terms of how missions are structured. Really, every other play style except the two above.
---
Here's the thing, when you divide down to corp, timezone, and the number of people who live in null who like small gang, you get b0rt ustz corp fleets pulling a dozen guys lol.
---
I'd like it to change, but nullsec culture takes time to grow up.
---
This may not overlap with your time on csm, but do you have any idea why CCP decided to add weapons timers to refitting?  I always thought that was a fun part of the gameplay, and I was really disappointed when ccp removed combat refitting. I've never really seen what they gained by removing it. I know when they talked about it at eve Vegas they said something about titans refitting and dreads refitting, but I dont know why they had to remove it for subcaps, or why it was a real problem on caps even
---
I'm 42 years old, been playing video games since Apple II, Atari 2600, through all the systems and all the years.  (Hate to be that guy, but it is what it is.)  It was not always like this...you'd buy a game, and if it sucked, well, lesson learned; you'd do something else.
---
I think it's also part of the breakdown of the home and kids who grew up TOO coddled with TOO much technology.  I don't know why there's this meme about "These companies don't care about gamers, they're only in it to make money!"
---
No fuckin' shit?
---
A lot of these emotional wrecks need a hug from dad or something.  They've been so inundated by consumer culture, advertising from companies that lie to them and make them feel like consuming a product is some act of love on either part.  Parents haven't warned kids that companies are providing a product, and you are a consumer.  No, they do not love you, and you shouldn't be looking to them for love.  Yes, you should accept good products and ignore bad ones.
---
But it's not a fucking moral crusade.  It's not a "big deal".  It's fucking video games.
---
I could go on and on, flesh out my thoughts, but I'm busy in a video game over here so I thought I'd blast this out.  😂
---
Wooooowwww this is amazing!
---
1. you cant make any sort of decent income hauling because there are too many hauler
---
2 you cant make any sort of decent income mining in HS because there are too many miners
---
if 3/4ths of all miners were to stop mining today you would not see a noticeable effect on ship prices for a long fucking time. hell last i ever bothered to check most t1 ships were selling for under mineral cost because there are too many miners who think they can make more by manufacturing ships over just selling the mins because 'i mined it so its free' mentality. i would GLADLY pay double for my frigates for pvp if it meant there were more people pvping instead of fucking mining. 
---
and how many times does it have to be pointed out that people who dont get out of hauling/mining/mission running to go pvp have lower retention rate
---
Whatever you decide on, know everything about that item.  Know what items are used to make it and why those prices fluctuate.  Know what regions to buy the materials the cheapest.  Look at history graph and figure out the reason prices jump/tank. Often you can make better isk buying and trading the items used to make the item you were looking into making when prices jump. 
---
Ex: if a rig spikes was it because salvage is in low supply?  Did the meta change? Is a war coming? Why is it in low supply? Is that because a new rig is being released that uses that salvage?  The economy is way more complex then most people realize
---
Was there ever any interest in expanding the universe more? Like adding another region or unlocking jove space, something like that.
---
Big drop in production.
---
I can't even imagine. But there were a lot of uncomfortable looks in the room when Veritas brought it up (it was during one of the Summit Little Things sessions).
---
were they about to suggest removing logi?
---
I've been kicking it around the last hour or so and if I had one piece of advice, it would look something like this:
---
1. Decide on your idea.
---
2. Come up with a **data-driven** presentation on why it's a good idea and is needed for the game.
---
3. Find a dev to champion it for you within CCP.
---
With step three obviously being the hard one. You'd have to find the right dev, in the right mood, at the right player gathering.
---
I know horde restaged supers/titans in Kalevala, I assume NC. moved theirs through geminate to ER/Kalevala to protect their renters/fight unspoken.
---
Not sure why the big spike in Venal though, that may be goons or init? Goons were staging some big stuff in PF- a month or so ago, maybe they moved that out.
---
I gotcha.  So there are NO areas of space where a small group of friends with no "big time influence" can just grind and have fun?  It's all completely dominated by huge corps?
---
EDIT: I don't expect you to explain EVE to me, sorry, thanks for taking time to answer a noob question. :-)
---
maybe not dox, but encourage him to pursue it.
---
... yeah, I can see that. Thanks.
---
If ships really were sold for less money than the cost of the minerals, how do you even do that?
---
I’ve got a stack of blueprints.
---
I’m going to build me a Rokh. Then I’m going to come kick your ass!
---
The Mittani used his position as the CSM 6 Chair to drive public discourse and discussion about the things he wanted CCP to do. Now whether you agreed with those specific things that he wanted or not, the fact that he guided the CSM like this was pure genius, and gave him a huge amount of soft power that he could then deploy within CCP's walls because he knew that if CCP didn't respond to him, they'd be responding to players at Fanfest and EVE Vegas.
---
It was something that hadn't been done before. The CSM had had Chairs before, and even one particularly good one (Mynxee) but the Chairs hadn't taken advantage of the bully pulpit to really drive a narrative with the players.
---
Hey man, thanks for the fight. How spooked were you at [this](https://i.gyazo.com/65ed33948c066acd030d5d9863e7871a.mp4) moment? We were pretty sad when you warped.

Renters unironically fight back more than the slumlords collecting rent lmao
---
well, according to something i read he was bought and paid for using some kind of Russian Paypal service, so there isn't much to go off of unless he all of a sudden heard himself in the dominion trailer  and started playing eve
---
very cool
---
CCP hasn't explained what it means, but apparently there's going to be a whole class about how to be a CSM member, no doubt with long discussions about what is appropriate and what is not. That's basically putting the CSM members into a nicely-defined box that it's going to be nearly impossible to break out of.
---
For example, I assume "speaking out in public on your popular blog about things you think CCP is doing that are stupid" is going to be something that is discouraged, if not outlawed.
---
All of them? No. Some of them? Oh my yes.
---
”CCP SoniClover” 
---
I don’t know how it’s supposed to be pronounced, but that name sounds like something a bitter neckbeard furry coder would come up with and think “Wow, I’m so clever. They’ll never get the reference or know that I bust a nut to a cartoon hedgehog”. 
---
At any rate, it sucks to hear that there are devs at CCP who are arrogant like that. CCP employees seem really chill on the whole, though. 
---
Love you CCP. I’m enjoying my free skillpoints!
---
Yeah but it was the amount that got me
---
Ah yeah that sucks for them to define it, rather than leaving it open to interpretation for those who run.
---
Unless they want to create a comprehensive 'guys you don't really have that much sway' let down, so they don't have to keep explaining it to every new member.
---
Whether you think this particular idea was bad is kind of irrelevant. The point is that even when something like this that might have a potential to be good (like certificates, say) was hooted at, not used, and judged stupid or irrelevant, then the idea was dropped... even if it had the potential to be iterated on to become good.
---
Certificates could have been further developed to create alliance-level certificates for ship doctrines, for instance.
---
It's funny because the metric that joining a corp will be best for player retention will likely become quickly invalidated now that all the jita spam corps are back.
---
Considering setting one up tbh to get my tax money's worth ( yes it will drive new players out of the game but how cares really ).
---
CCP doesn't have to do anything the CSM says. You can't give orders, so you have no hard power.
---
So you have to use soft power to motivate CCP to do or at least consider the things you want. Google "soft power" to learn more.
---
&gt;You have to understand that in the two years leading up to the release of Incarna, there were almost no features added to the game that the player base wanted.
---
I predicted the rage back in 2008, when the signs of CCP not putting any effort into EVE were already obvious :) I got laughed at.
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/30001573/201905131800/
---
I played it. It was OK. Copied EVE a little **too** faithfully here and there.
---
They did one thing that I thought was amazing: they deleted attributes. I can't believe that EVE still has attributes. It's nuts.
---
10-minute timer * 2 per structure meaning 20 minutes per structure or about 17 hours of grinding to get them all.
---
&gt; CCP was terrified that if they did DUST 514 as a PC release, EVE would die, 
---
Are they literally retarded?
---
Do you think that the dev's behind the UI actually know what they are doing?     
---
So, when they say "we removed the legacy ship/item hangar buttons, because it distracts new players", but at the same time they don't change the default, small overview - do they actually know for a fact that this helps new players or is it just "I don't care but trust me" mentality?     
---
(I still don't get why they would remove an UI button but leave the shortcuts and the functionality in)
---
I don't know. I suspect there was a little bit of his own legend working against him, though. He'd achieve these impossible things with a tiny team so I imagine the feeling was that he was just grand-standing.
---
Erwin Rommel suffered under his success in the same way. Had Hitler supported Rommel with even a quarter of the things Rommel had asked for, the Mediterranean would have been an Axis lake.
---
Why be so vague about it being a ferox fleet?
---
Hilmar not understanding EVE makes perfect sense, looking at what they are doing with the game...
---
Whats your predictions for now, oh wise seer
---
3 years in relation to 16 years.
---
And even without skill injectors or an overwhelming supercapital advantage, the goons were still the most powerful alliance for the majority of EVEs history. What the goons had in numbers, the other alliances had in assets and experience. When skill injectors came out, the goons could transform those numbers into supercapital assets. You can't translate your experience with using capitals in pvp into supercapital assets. 
---
You also shouldn't forget that goons (the entity) is also *very* old. They just always focused more on numbers than on trying hard, but recently they started the latter and were gifted an enormous advantage through the former. 
---
Add to this citadels, which made the bunkering down of an entire region possible, and required alliances to hold physically less sov for building supercaps.
---
When I started I made ships. I thought, hey, everyone needs ships right? I was right, but I also hadn’t realized that I couldn’t compete with the mass producers that make 1000 talos at a time and could price way below the profit margin. So I moved to ammo and guns because I thought, hey, you need guns on your ships and ammo to use those guns right? I was right and I was wrong, because I couldn’t produce 10 million antimatter M way below the profit margin. So I moved to large rigs. And even t2 large rigs. And found myself making money. Then I moved to structures back when they were first released. And then I dived into capital ships and sold a shot ton of revs. My recommendation: make rigs. Use buy orders in perimeter to get your materials. Join a decent Corp with a solid industrial set up and use their azbels to make things.
---
&gt;Those are not the "vocal users" those are guys who are there to represent the playerbase
---
Yeah, I get that. That's why I think they probably could have handled the situation better. OP painted a pretty bad picture of those guys outside of just being the average jaded game developer.
---
The triglavians seem to be named after Finnish and Slavic folklore. 
---
If you played The Witcher 3 you probably recognise Leshak.
---
I've used it as I mentioned, and I know other people who do to, but you are probably also right. I do, however, think that the skill restrictions on alphas is kind of stupid. Either keep the SP cap and enforce it, but let alphas train basically anything they want up to it, or don't have it but have the skill restrictions.
---
holy cow!!!!
---
Yeah, you're probably right. Still, people leaving EVE in creative ways has been celebrated before.
---
The EVE Community is a national treasure.
---
I thought about it, but (a) it would have been a huge amount of hassle to do all on my own without any help; and (b) part of the prize pool was going to be funded by extracting SP from two of my mains and I was afraid that if I started doing that, I'd be preemptively banned and accused of RMT. After all, I'd already provided written proof to CCP that I was quitting.
---
But make sure you throw them towards the enemy, let them slowboat and hopefully hit something..

very old post by CCP Greyscale that talks about how to post good enough to get a response from a dev
---
Not wrong, there’s always somebody pulling wrecks during a battle..
---
&gt; .you'd buy a game, and if it sucked,
---
you'd go on reddit and complain. No, that's wrong that didn't exist.
---
You went on twitter, ha!
---
nevermind. You talked to your best buddies who also bought the game, or something.
---
That's the main difference. But i have to agree, that the internet does *seem* to become ever more toxic.
---
The title is obviously a bit of hyperbole - It's not like Autocannons aren't good enough to see use - But I do think they lack a serious niche in the combat ecosystem, and I wanted to show just how little I felt their supposed strengths shine through in actual combat situations, at least by my maths!
---
God damn nice voice!
---
Just when we thought bot had enough people show up, suddenly skillu.
---
How with they ever recover from such a mortal blow!
---
Thank you for the kind words! And yeah, there's some really good discussions taking place in some of these question threads.
---
B0T + their pets
---
&gt;Rorq nerfs made getting stronger harder for smaller groups. 
---
every single nerf will make getting stronger harder on an absolute scale, given that small groups when they do mine they tend to do it in moons in the first place I doubt they were affected *that* hard. you ain't gonna find a small group mining a colossal with much regularity. 
---
Also not every nerf needs to adress smaller groups being able to stand up to bigger ones, i'm not sure where this narrative has come from, it's *especially* weird given the ones who are normally talking about it aren't in small groups to begin with.
---
And to finish up let's not kid ourselves, people in small groups in aggregate have enough isk, enough to sustain a lot of stuff, they just aren't willing to engage in the mind boggling bore fest that is the current fleet pvp. Isk is not a big issue in eve today, and certainly its lack isn't the reason there's not more destruction.
---
Funny enough, this makes sense as to why Walking in Stations was shelved. people stopped using it because bugs were rampant, and the diehards got shafted because no one used it.
---
Hope you're doing well!  Hit me up on Discord anytime.  (ullerrm#3485)
---
I'd agree that players need increasing hits, but I'm not 100% sure that "bigger fight" = "bigger hit of dopamine."  The nature of the fight is important.
---
Most of my most satisfying moments in Eve were not huge fights, and some of them weren't even fights at all -- they were fights where the outcome was **meaningful** to me for some reason, whether that's "participated in a big supercap brawl" or something more long-term like "force big alliance X out of their space over several months", or even short-term shit like "sent a roaming gang back home using just a Vexor and grit" or "took out a Taranis on a roam and didn't die."  Or even out-of-game shit like "made my first good propaganda pic" or "jury-rigged the streaming setup for Syndicate Competitive League using three PCs in my apartment and a mixing board" or "wrote a bot to scrape ratting activity from the API to pick systems to cloaky camp" or "went to my first Fanfest."
---
The desire for increasing meaning, to put your actions in context, is the real illusive one. And it feels like CCP's chief failure of the last few years has been providing opportunities to chase that. Some of that is balance and structure (e.g. the death of small gang), and some of it is just ignoring the value that players put on *leaving a legacy* (e.g. the perpetually recurring suggestion to put a "Built by __" tag on hulls).
---
The day that I logged in and thought "almost nothing I do in-game will actually affect the state of the game" is the last day I logged in.  Everything I did with notable impact was out-of-game, and not in a way that fulfilled me.
---
blob urself
---
Let me do the numbers for you:  
---
29.5b / 240 ships = ...  
---
let me calculate ...  
---
yeah, that's right, a Ferox fleet  
---
which equals to ...  
---
yeah got the answer:  
---
who the fuck cares
---
Screen and memory reading bots tend to have a reset/flush cycle to clear random windows it doesn't need or may have popped up on screen to then not interfere with how the bot itselfs works. Take the message when warping to a rock haven for example. If that message window blocks part of the screen that it needs to read it would fail so it tries to hit the X or Ok. I imagine fleet invites would also trigger this.
---
Don't they understand that people play multiple games?
---
I try to, but it requires friends :(
---
Is it generally better to mine the minerals or just to buy them. I imagine that it takes more time but is the payoff worth it?
---
oh my god
---
you can make a fuckton of money hauling if you aren't retarded
---
Space Ultima Online if you prefer: an old MMO from way back that new players can ignore because the existing player base is too insular, closed, and outdated for anyone new to bother learning.
---
It's the internet, you're allowed to swear in post titles.
---
Jesus, even the biggest j4j in TEST has more than one cruiser loss to talk about...
---
You're just that old. ;)  
---
Nah. There's plenty of us who still remember it, at least dimly.
---
But aren't those numbers processed somehow anyway? 
---
Not having anything to do with code probably makes me think too easy about it, but i'd have thought that they can pull that stuff from logs after a fight ended or something.
---
oh shit hes in a Rokh! Well i just bought an Armageddon, put some plates on that bitch
---
not as a newbie
---
I thought that on Singularity there is a slash command that toggles between Alpha and Omega.
---
Several months ago, one of my friends resubbed his account, but his account was still an alpha when Singularity was last synced so it was still showing up as an alpha when he logged into sisi. If I remember correctly, he fixed that with a slash code, however I don't remember what that was. (And I'm at work right now, so I can't look it up.)
---
Edit: My friend thinks it's /alpha to switch to alpha status and /omega to switch to omega. Will test when I get home.
---
I have been told (as with much else, cannot confirm) that the female Russian voice was one of the GMs.
---
Thank you for your advice!
---
Can you maybe tell me how the price of a haul contract gets calculated? I'd imagine that people want a certain minimum ISK per jump.
---
I remember the Jita riots
---
&gt;Solo play? Super dead. 
---
Buddy? YOU AIN'T KIDDING.
---
oh I'm talking about "burn them all" commander guy.
---
Again it depends. A lot of people mine the minerals and build with them but it depends on your skills around mining. If you don’t have T2 skills, it might be more profitable to buy the minerals but also run missions or something else that makes you isk
---
If I was a department manager at a computer game development company, what depth of management would you recommend? Answer on a scale of 1 to 10. 1 is completely hands-off, 10 is ultra micromanagement.  If there are different levels of management for different departments that you would recommend, feel free to elaborate.
---
Oh they did fight back for a time and they still doing it. Damned Brotherhood, Skeleton Crew , X Community and some members of BOT are still fighting. We can event have nice fights with them without it become a 600 hudread people blob festival.  
---
Plus, we never denied we didn't batphoned other superpower in some situation. We had obviously prolonged Panfam eviction process in ER by doing so, otherwise, the purging of ER would have been finish a couple of weeks ago. Plus, by buying us time like this, we managed to continue our campaign in the Spire and cripple their slaves pits infrastructures for a couple additional weeks.   
---
You can be sure that event if they ended up kicking us out of ER, we will continue from other spots in the galaxy. We did the same with the DRF, expect us to do the same with Panfam.
---
1. Mostly greed, plus a big helping of not understanding those other play styles, except for the drama they introduced (CCP hates drama). But bigger alliances both cause less drama for CCP, they have longer sub times and aspirational goals (get all four titans!) that CCP approves of because these goals give CCP a lot of money.
---
2. Sort of. The best thing a CSM can do for the player base is pull together Little Things efforts to get these player ideas a broad audience. CCP devs as a group aren't interested in an idea that is submitted by one person. But take that same idea and provide data that you've put it in front of 10K players and 5K of them really liked it?  That will get that idea a hearing.
---
3. Good: the agile methodology, used wisely, is a good fit for CCP's employees. Bad: there's not enough structure about what should be done and why. It's a failure of leadership.
---
4. Very much done after my CSM term was over. The Rifter was still very much #1 EVE's image during my time. I actually made (with my wife's help) a few dozen devs custom-made embroidered hoodies with a funny little comment about their job on the front with the EVE Online logo, and an embroidered Rifter on the back. For instance, the one I made for karkur said "You push my buttons." The one I made for Falcon said "EVE Illuminati".
---
More to the point, do they not understand that the audience for a slow-paced spaceship MMO is almost mutually exclusive from the audience for a fast-paced sci-fi FPS?
---
There is no enthusiasm for Walking in Stations inside CCP. They see it as a mistaken era best forgotten.
---
Bring back my play style, and bring back the capability for smaller alliances to exist and hold space independently of huge alliances.
---
Thank you for the tip!
---
Is there a way to find out the reason of low supply or such? zkillboard, reddit or something else? I find it hard to find out if a war is about to break out or even happening. Is it simply just watching the map statistics if there is a lot of fights going on or like checking if certain corps/alliances got wardecced?
---
&gt;  I honestly don’t think there’s anyone smart enough to create game mechanics compelling enough to counteract human nature.

Make it a resource gathering real time strategy game and all of the PvPers will leave. The only conflict will be on Discord Online in the #diplo channels, and it will certainly be local.

there, solved.
---
This... is a very good question. Hm.
---
I would have played more to my strengths and less to my weaknesses. Instead of playing the games of some of the devs that just wanted to sideline or shoehorn the CSM, I would have concentrated my focus on CCP management and pushing more change from the top down. I know the language of the C-suite and I had really good luck motivating CCP management. I would have just kept my mouth shut more with the individual devs.
---
But I always felt like I had to engage the individual devs too and that just added stress to my life without the corresponding benefit. So yeah, that's what I would do if I could go back and redo.

You'll want to join the in game channel "Haulers Channel" to get specific and up-to-date advice.

With all this talk about GotG bots people seems to have forgotten that Frat is highly associated with botting and their proxy alliances seem to go exactly the same way.

Its fun how obvious bots are when you figure their timer and when they change it after two days killing them one by one without any reasonable (human) response you figure the changed timer to do the same with the same result..

I love being a songwriter

Added lore is great but his complaint isn’t about added lore, it’s about some trivialities of whether or not to include unfinished development ideas that the community then demands for the next decade. Doesn’t seem unreasonable.
---
I can add to that:
---
Around 2014 or 2015, i was at a job that had tons of disadvantages - like me not being allowed to do my actual job - and some advantages - like having a shitton of enterprise grade business analysis software, all up to date, all licensed, all doing nothing because reasons only c-level wisdom can understand.        
---
So i started farting around with that stuff in my copious empty hours at work. Im a security guy by trade, no data scientist or business informatics, so it was young pwnie playing forbidden and clueless ffa in daddies workshop in the shed.
---
Feeding randomized product "output" into an ERP system that is layed out for a logistics chain - think car production for example - generates all kinds of really interesting flares, christ a lot of this software is bad when it comes to IT security. 
---
But that got lame fast, and I was wondering where to get a better dataset to play with.    
---
Come Fanfest and CCP actually doing some work on the generated data they had.      
---
So at my yearly fanfest trip, after some economics talk by the Dr. himself and a cozy little roundtable about data gathered on player retention, I pestered the aforementioned and his minions. Throwing the data they collected at some of the big name software products in the field of HR personel analysis, enterprise resource planning, financial analysis and whatever the commodity trade guys use sounded like a fun project.       
---
My general idea was to look at New Eden as a large company (with some obvious compromises) for the HR and ERP side and its market for the financial and trade analysis side from a perspective of an omniscient market actor (another obvious compromise).        
---
Heck, im sure any software company would have loved to shit out a bunch of free licenses just for the PR factor.    
---
The idea was received well and shot down in the same breath quoting budget and resource constraints.               
---
From what I could coax out of them, they were mostly playing firefighters at the time - if memory serves right, plex and some other items back then had some weird fluctuations and there still was the money laundering via expensive stuff dropped at deep saves going on. They had their own ideas but got often bogged down with hands-on daily business stuff that ought to be automated. Main reason for that was not having the tools to constantly monitor factors that would allow things to be automated.
---
     
---
Additionally, there still was considerable technical debt within the database construct which made large scale real time queries outside the game requirements dicy, the re-structuring wasnt finished until two years later.
---
The current state of things feels very much like the firefighting again, or your average overworked sysadmin not being allowed to sit down, understand and fix the problem but running himself ragged by fixing symptoms.
---
Wasn't multiboxing prohibited back in the day? Like classic/BC maybe wotlk?
---
Maybe it was just perceived as cheating by the broad masses when someone was multiboxing a bunch of chain lightning schamys in Alterac x)
---
It's the Creator!  0/
---
See, this is the thing: I've always approved of CCP's development philosophy, more or less. It's just that they're always chasing the needle, going after what's trendy, and ignoring player desires over what will get them some miraculous broad support. So it wasn't so much the people so much as how those people were used.
---
If I could pick the development company that had bought CCP? Hi-Rez, definitely. Though they also have their faults, and large ones, they would certainly have focused CCP on EVE's strengths.
---
As AUTZ I have no choice but to alarm clock for every major fight
---
I'm sorry I'm giving you a negative view of EVE... that's certainly not my intent. If you're having fun, by all means ignore my stupid ass and go have fun! I always encourage fun in EVE where it can be found.
---
If you'd asked me a few years ago: are there more casuals than hard-cores? I definitely would have said yes. These days, I'm not so sure. I think the hard-cores are taking over in a big way though of course I don't have access to the data to say for sure.
---
The whole point and purpose to TiDi and to Brain-in-a-Box was to increase the size of the fights in EVE. I'm convinced that pretty much everything CCP has done in the last three or four years has been with that goal in mind.
---
Do not listen to that guy. Ships are rarely worth the effort. Unless it's tech 2. And then only the ones actually used by the nullsec entities. 
---
Minerals you mine have an opportunity cost attached. 
---
If you could mine minerals and that makes you an item worth 20 million isk. But the value of these minerals in the market are 25 million. Then you would not have made 20 million isk. But lost 5 million potential profit. 
---
You have to see mining/manufacturing/selling as 3 different games
---
With mining you get minerals that have a certain value. Let's say 25 mil isk on buy order. That's 25 mil mining profit. Or put up a sell order for your minerals and get 27 million isk, but you need to play the market game. 
---
Now you use these minerals to manufacture something. You can sell this item for 30 mil to buy order. You now made 5 mil isk manufacturing profit. 
---
Now comes the market profit. Buy orders are instant isk. But putting up a sell order might net you a little more. But you need to play the market. Adjust your orders now and then when you get undercut etc. The item may then sell for 32 million on sell order. You now made 2 million isk market profit. 
---
You can either start your empire at the bottom. And start mining and work it into an item and sell it on the market. Or you could do 1 of these things. Let's say you just want to manufacture. Then you buy your ore from the marketeer at sell order value. From the above example at 27 mil isk. And produce your item and sell it to buy order at 30 mil isk for a 3 mil manufacturing profit. 
---
There are lots of items with profit margins. It all comes down to finding the right item. I can't tell you what to make. What's good to make now might not be so good next week. Also make sure you look at researched bpo's or bpc's and take the bpc price into considerations aswel if you end up buying them from contract.
---
Now go around a star
---
Small-gang PvP, for which the golden age was 2008 through 2010. Goons and PL then started farming all the smallish alliances that held space, first in the east, then in the west, then across EVE. Those who wouldn't be farmed (most of them) were crushed, absorbed, or both.
---
There hasn't been a place for a completely independent small space-holding alliance since that transition concluded. That's also the dawn of super-large alliances and coalitions in EVE.
---
Yep! And I would start playing EVE earlier so the play style I loved could have lasted longer. I probably could have had just as much fun in 2006 and 2007 as I had from 2008 through 2010 had I not stubbornly resisted starting EVE. (See above, search for "WoW".)
---
yeah but you have to organise your stuff into all that shit
---
&gt; And CCP Veritas: "Every alliance worth anything should have a programmer." Veritas was a great guy, but he was completely dismissive of small alliances and felt that every alliance worth anything should have a big full time staff, including what basically amounted to an IT department. I never could convince him that there should be a place for smaller alliances.
---
Words cannot express how unfathomably enraged this makes me, because I strongly feel it was this specific factor which lead to so much alliance solidification in the years after Dominion: If you didn't have a whole constellation of highly-skilled support personnel managing your alliance and "backend", you were dead in the water. The bar was set unapproachably high, and then we were *shocked* when not many groups could make it.
---
I have a strong fondness for when it seemed any alliance with a free forum and Ventrilo server could do reasonably well!
---
except freight containers because ccp hates you
---
You once said to me, about three years ago, the following:
---
"I can pin down the day that EVE will die with a great deal of accuracy: it'll come about a year after CCP turns its focus 100% toward trying to build content for players and gives up on just creating tools for players to create their own content. There's no way the tiny number of EVE devs would be able to keep up."
---
How close are we to that point? Also thanks for everything you've done for the game and this community if do indeed win Eve. The game has never been the same since you stopped blogging about it.
---
Saw your thread while scrolling all, and this is exactly what booted my ass out of EVE and honestly, I miss it, but the game went to hog shit, the changes to ice mining killed my iskflow, knew a few close friends that got podded trying to mine ice when they changed to scanned locations because they didn't have someone or another's blessing to be mining there, then came Rubicon. I could no longer survive in lvl 4 missions, and it was completely not worth it anymore since the rewards had been tanked, I wasn't skilled up enough to run incursions and was something like 6 months from getting accepted to a insursion team and it just wasn't worth it anymore, it felt like a game that pushed that you could do anything just decided that I could do anything, so long as that anything was null sec PvP.
---
I miss EVE and I think about going back sometimes, but I know there's just nothing there that I would enjoy anymore
---
It's not negative. It's more along the lines that I didn't realize there was as much turmoil or background noise as there is. I guess I just assumed everything was great behind the doors.
---
Your insight is incredible.
---
You said Eve had years of life yet remaining. Can CCP make progress towards increasing the population and returning to the sandbox roots the game came from?
---
That is correct, however the algorithm that says ‘there are enough people running Abyss to spawn the gate’ does not look at your fit. So those who were running T5 and have now stopped (instead of downgrading to T4) results in less numbers in abyss and less PvP gates.
---
I don't know what to say, except that this is what we were told. They even insisted on calling it "cannibalism" which amused me.
---
follow reddit, forums, devblogs, propaganda, and twitch.  Its better to specialize in a handful of items and know everything about those than to try and deal in everything.  
---
Also specialize in the items you like to fly and the fitting you know.  I started out dealing in bombers, torpedoes, launchers, cloaks etc because it was the game play i enjoyed the most.
---
Hahah omg I missed these. Hope we'll see more once the war kicks off.
---
The situation back then was obvious with CCP taking over White Wolf and working on WoD, not doing any updates and really only working on making a working character animation thing for WoD (that Nvidia demo looked amazing back then).
---
Combine that with their changed goal (the goal used to be "make a cool game" and that changed to "we want 300k subscribers" which forced them to make the game more dumbed down/easily accessible. Add the typical Icelandic stubbornness and unless you were blind it was obvious to see what was going to happen. Thing is of course that many people WERE blind, so they didn't see it happening and just trolled.
---
Atm none of us have any idea about what is going to happen, how much effort CCP is going to put in to EVE (or perhaps have dev time and resources pulled away by PA for other projects, if any). CCP has put in effort to EVE lately but they've also done stuff that didn't exactly make it better, they've been focusing on content that is not native to the game (trig stuff) and seem to go all in with that.
---
It's impossible to do any sort of prediction, other than "CCP is going to monetize the abbyssal stuff".
---
Nice to see you are still out and about,  even if you did declare yourself to be 'winning'
---

EVE Offline
---
&gt;Now add to this toxic soup strong rumors that CCP was looking into gold ammo and using money to buy ships or other advantage in game... then a CCP newsletter that comes out that seems to completely confirm the very worst rumors? Then have Hilmar not only reconfirm the rumors, but strongly defend those actions?
---
You forget that all that micro-transaction and one-room walking in stations was only the last straw.
---
Remember how EVE was to play back then, it is very easy to forget. It was completely broken, a complete mess. We had fights in lowsec with 100 people and everything just desynced, the game basically crashed when the fun started and after like 30min when you finally managed to log back in you where in a pod back home.
---
And that wasn't the only thing. They added incomplete feature after incomplete feature, told us they would iterate on it and jumped to the next thing. It was a mess, literally an I mean it literally unplayable. And it was like that for years, only kept alive by a believe in its potential, which was getting tested with every expansion until the summer of rage came and the massive missteps from CCP let the rage spill over.
---
When Jon Lander came in he for the first time ditched the feature expansions and actually prioritized fixing the game. They actually managed to make it playable and the EVE we have to day is very very different in that regard and all thanks to this man.
---
that's older then me lol
---
very clear at least, thanks for answering
---
The range of 3rd party tools and API connected sites for eve blows my mind.
---
Does jedi huffing still work ? Was trying it out and the sleeper npcs were going much faster than me at speeds of up to 1600 ms, did ccp do something to nerf it ?
---
Ummm... not to be cruel, but SoniClover was a bit of a huge neckbeard, yes.
---
Worst presenter I've ever seen, too.
---
SISI, the only server you see Nancy. undocking titans 😂
---
It's too late now. Too much damage has been done.
---
Well that thread revealed why its so frustratingly hard to find wormholes in my home null region but i can't go 4 jumps in lowsec without tripping over half a dozen.
---
This feels like one of the Seldon Crises.
---
Honest question: why not? I see all the pro veteran players shitting on abyssal content, but as a solo player for me its a FANTASTIC way to engage in end-game pve AND pvp content without being mandatory part of a large nullsec alliance like everything else in EVE nowadays. 
---
As a solo player, right now its literally the only thing primarly keeping me in the game.
---
This is the best AMA I’ve read in years. Did you guys ever talk about Somer lottery?
---
So, what's stopping the CSM from self-organzing like that and establishing an unofficial chair?
---
There are areas such as Faction warfare space, NPC Null and high sec where a small corp can live without any issues. The problem is that CCP makes changes (or a lack of changes) that make it so hard for small groups to find "fun" content that playing the game becomes a waste of time. The small group isn't destroyed by the mega corp, its just that there is no point in playing the game as a small group.
---
For example Faction Warfare hasn't received any major changes for years now and so much of the playerbase has lost interest and quit/left and without any changes bots and farmers (people who avoid PVP at all costs) have figured out how to exploit the system. This means that small scale pvp groups that live in Low Sec find it much harder to find content than a few years ago, and so more of them quit which just makes the situation worse.
---
Another example would be CCP introducing Rorquals and skill injectors and doing nothing to curb supercap proliferation. So small gang groups who liked to roam around Null Sec and find people out in space to shoot now find most people in ships that are basically impossible for them to kill. Again this play style becomes unviable and a bunch of people quit, since there isn't really an equivalent playstyle being supported by CCP.
---
Best way to win a one on one fight is to be the third one to arrive.
---
It's not that such types of activities are impossible, it's just that the structure of the game as it exists today doesn't really encourage or reward them very much.
---
Hey, same here!
---
&gt; for about a year after E1 got banned, James 315's disciples told anyone that they ganked that I would handle reimbursement of their ships. It took a fucking year before the GMs put a stop to it.
---
Not gonna lie, as far as pettiness goes that's pretty brilliant.
---
Wow a one login account structure would be incredible
---
Thank you for the detailed answer!
---
I think I'll just crawl through the market for a while to find a fitting item and take mining into consideration.
---
Awesome, thanks for the answers! I’ll have to check out Rebel Galaxy. 
---
It would be neat if there was some way to encourage smaller groups. Maybe a tax based on alliance size or something(I know Eve players would find a way around it). It would be a far more interesting Eve universe if you could somehow encourage more groups of smaller people. Like a bunch of 100 man alliances fighting for their own space. 
---
I guess it’s a hard vision to realize and CCP most definitely has no desire to stop this mega coalition stuff, so for now it’s just a thought.
---
I'm not convinced that the devs even play the game.
---
Oh jeez, I remember that blog post. Wtf
---
&gt; hell last i ever bothered to check most t1 ships were selling for under mineral cost because there are too many miners who think they can make more by manufacturing ships over just selling the mins because 'i mined it so its free' mentality.
---
You can't fix stupid
---
you can't make any money as a newbie period
---
telling new players not to get into hauling/market sourcing is dumb because it's one of the BIGGEST sources of income you can have in eve period outside of high level manipulation or utilizing ur trillionaire wallet girth
---
A newbie can learn how to make fuckoff amounts of isk
---
I see...thanks for the detailed response.  Some of this reminds me of some of the content in Runescape; the developers don't keep it fresh and so players don't even touch it.  Players beg for "make [activity] great again!" but it never gets worked on.  I guess you have to focus on what butters your bread...
---
My corp/alliance ha always lived in curse. And it's just stupid hard these days to do anything without the big blocks smashing you. It's sooo true that there is only two ways to play now
---
Is it generally smarter to produce/sell in the main trade hubs?
---
Thanks man. We need more of that spirit and less "EvE Is DyInG OmG"
---
I thought wtf, then I saw it was Havish and was like, oh, OK.
---
I'm gonna say about a month's worth of full time work of a senior full stack dev with brains. The issue is that their db setup is an outdated clusterfuck, and presence of devs with brains is questionable based on the observations of the new chat system implementation.
---
Me too man. Been flying the Vagabond for years now, even when it was no longer the best choice
---
more like eat my cringe
---
these songs are always so awful and cringey and the lyrics are forced as hell
---
Never seen a brave fleet without one idiot in a noctis.
---
&gt;James brought up the idea of buying biomass from LP stores and assembling Frankenstein monsters. 
---
Yeah, sounds like me.
---
Gotcha, thanks.
---
So is the loss of your playstyle more a player-driven thing, or a CCP-driven thing? Essentially, do you think it was inevitable that small alliances would eventually disappear or did something change to increase that possibility?
---
Do you mind if you clarify? Why is it viewed as mistaken? What were the problems?
---
And since were here, since they shut down WIS, why still maintain the over complicated character creation?
---
I second this! I read it religiously.   
---
Also, thank you for THIS AMA!
---
How was the drama of CCP Mintchip from your viewpoint?
---
That proteus still isn’t showing up though.
---
yup
---
But more damage can be prevented
---
Sorry you had to go through that.  I was unfamiliar with the story and have just very interestingly been reading through this thread. I do not even play EVE, but I admire what you did.  I just hope that some day E1 gets some proportional level of justice meted out to him.
---
Tbf a thorax in 2003 was one of the biggest ships around
---
or they can find a decent corp and have actual FUN. there are literally hundreds of decent corps who will be happy to bankroll a newbie while they learn how to play and make their own isk
---
Aww you remember me

I attached the (excellent) [Iron Tide print](https://content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/66994/1/the_iron_tide_high_resolution_desktop_2700x1517_hd-wallpaper-531555.jpg) to my freshman dorm room with pins and scotch tape, which of course took the top layer of printing off the corners. Regret doing it now since it would be quite nice framed.

Well if we get a cinematic trailer with the Triglavians at some point...... 🤔
---
Now try it in lowsec where the pilots skill is 10times better
---
If things remain stable as they are, about five more years. At that point, the user base will shrink 25-50% and there will be a crisis in the in-game economy.
---
How much influence do you think certain "alliances" or individuals have over CCP?
---
Assuming he was in charge of the moongoo rebalance then he definitely didn't know his shit :P If he argued against it and was ignored then alright fine. It should have been re balanced no doubt, their re-balance made it like 10x worse though :| Shouldn't complain too much though I my first few bil from their stupidity.
---
I'm not Jester, but I was involved with Eve's lore and roleplay community since long before TonyG, so I'll try and give some further context:
---
It's hard to explain now that culture changed so much, but Eve was initially a *very* cyberpunk-inspired, shades-of-grey setting. The website used to explicitly reference The Matrix and Neuromancer as media for getting an idea of what you could expect in Eve - and the fiction reflected that. There were no good guys; terrorists struck at slavers while corporate tyrannies fought for cultural freedom from a mob-ruled federation crumbling under its own weight.
---
TonyG fundamentally didn't get this.
---
The best analogy I can give is that he thought he was writing mature Star Wars, where "mature" ends up meaning Game of Thrones-tier violence and sex but without any of character nuance that makes Thrones any good. All the violence and graphic sex, but with boring black and white morality and no real character arc.
---
Now, remember what Jester said somewhere above about CCP seeming to respect "experts in their field"? Well, some of the people who joined CCP in the years after Empyrean Age came from the lore/RP community - and they had a universally dim opinion of TonyG. I strongly suspect this (thankfully) got CCP to quickly figure out how bad an idea he was.
---
Can't really speak to that, but yeah, I was disappointed in the change as well.
---
Hyperbole? This is dirty Amarr propaganda!
---
Just kidding of course. I'm all for the suggested improvement in T2 ammo. I don't like the heat idea because increase the amount of game mechanics even more. Which means it's even more difficult for new players to get up to speed. New players have trouble with heat anyways. The reload buff would be nice. I dislike it ecause of lore like reasons. Crystals are supposed to be swapped quickly with projectiles you have to move those heavy projectiles around.  
---
For the damage dealt graph: Please stop for a moment and think why 720mm has the most overall damage dealt. It's because Muninns fit them. Rails have a good number of DPS because Feroxes use them. Those ships push the statistics up because they are used in large scale fleets. Imagine autocannons would be used in small scale fights but the number of fights would be the same then their overall damage dealt would still be less. It's like looking at at Feroxes and Brutixes and damage dealt. If you'd buff the Brutix so much that it's as good in fleets as the Ferox it would be overpowered in solo PvP. Just because there are numbers it doesn't mean they are usefull. We don't need any graphs to know that Muninns and Feroxes are flown a lot in the recent past.
---
Nobody ever brought up something like that when I was around.
---
I'm not sure I'm the right person to ask, I'm not good at it, but I have a lot of fun!
---
I think it depends on the company. The smaller the company, the lower the number. I think it would be impossible to coordinate a large AAA gaming development project without a good size management staff to coordinate communications and keep everyone in sync.
---
karkur is better than average about checking the things she wants to do with players ahead of time, so yeah, I'm fine with her work.
---
M space (mirror space), another copy of the map accessible only through wormholes.
---
CCP sounds incapable, how did they ever launch a playable game?
---
man I never watched the dominion trailer and I regret this so much. that was fucking so dope.
---
seconded for subnautica... amazing game!
---
because you know, the csm isnt a senate of career paper pushers voted in by null blocs who push for changes on their group's behalf... except steve
---
Lore says a different galaxy, so far away that the people of Earth hadn't figured out where it was relative to the Milky Way by the time the Eve Gate collapsed.
---
Can confirm, depending on what time of the beta it is it would be would be very unfun. Hell without other people it's probably no fun at any point. It'd be a nice look for a few little while then basically never touch again. Also most people would die on the spot looking at the old UI :P

---
I'm aware of this, and I mention it in my article that it's most used in a fleet context, which is why I don't compare the 720's to Autos. However it's a graph CCP has presented in response to concern about the state of Autos in the past, and I wanted to explain why I didn't think it made sense to use the simple fact that *they are used* as an argument against buffing Autocannons.

&gt;or they can find a decent corp and have actual FUN.

and if you enjoy hauling, what's wrong with that?
---
people enjoy what they enjoy

From my experience as a product owner it usually comes from resource burden (time or system)
---
can you say that louder for all the fresh csm candidates in the back please
---
Is there a master download of all ship preview images (the image you see on the info panel you get when you Show Info on a ship) somewhere?

Thanks for taking the time to reply. I hope you enjoy what ever comes next for you.

Look up the product owner role in a scrum ceremony. Write a case study and BRD for the feature.

Hilmar is one of the most disconnected morons ever when it comes to Eve. Nothing but constant damage to the game. Axing him would be the greatest thing ever for the game. Just read this interview excerpt from him about things he wants in the game. The man is a fucking moron.

was she the one who removed the wallet from the default neocom? yikes

I don't think it ever was, at least not at any time that I've played it.

Nowadays there are even entire communities of multiboxers with impressively optimized setups playing battlegrounds against each other.
---
No one cares what you think globby.
---
&gt;I think if EVE reopened closed parts of the sandbox, that's all they'd have to do.
---
What did you see them close?
---
The man is a complete moron and has literally zero understanding of Eve. Axing him would be the greatest thing ever for this game. Just read this interview from him regarding things he thinks would be good for Eve.

Come back to rote. We hustle for small gang every night

Also, as I've delved my nose into pyfa's graphs, now I can implement new ones with little effort - share your ideas of graphs which you might find useful (along with description on how you would use them). If idea is worthy, it might be added by may 28th (which is EVE's may update release day).

&gt;Crimewatch
---
ive never heard of that what is it?
---
eddit nvm its the suspect system
---
Hilmar especially is a moron. He always has been. The man has done more damage to Eve than anyone else. I mean just read this excerpt from an interview he did. Axing him would be the best thing that ever happened to Eve.  
---
That doesn’t even make any sense
---
Not sure how wild this is but my guess if it's about the second part mostly and a bit of the first part, it may give too much data to players to let them figure out and use as evidence how broken some systems are and demand change. There has been a lot of major shifts in pvp, especially "fleet" pvp (if you could call the bad old days that). Gang, overview, and broadcast changes have been massive in shifting it to be very one-dimensional over the years. Eve is more complex in a lot of ways then it used to be, but it's also a fuck ton simpler. A lot of what they've added is just work and not really playing the game, though that's not to say that a lot of the QOL changes haven't removed some tedium either but they've been replaced with other tedium.
---
We warned this would happen....
---
plot twist: this happened in nullsec.
---
what is  Rule 12 and rule 11?
---
Judging from the other decisions they made, and are still making, probably.
---
Or just people being really our of touch.
---
Really, really out of touch.
---
wow 130 titans... u do know they are going up against goons right?
---
Can they? Sure.
---
you could start writing a little story with all those citadel names...
---
I remember that. Took me forever to get my sec status back up after all the Jita smartbombing.
---
If you equate this to a reddit victory post i have bad news for you. Its not.
---
That squad is designed to welp all their shit.
---
So... Meh?
---
Who cares?
---
The fact that you had the balls to undock thou... now that is news.
---
yep always though there needed to be a regional or constaltion limit beings some contenet that way
---
Also, Everquest is a game that has survived a decade past it's high point.
---
Minmaxing was always a problem, but it was less so because of the limitations players had at the time. Some are a little irrelevant now but it's not like people didn't do it before :| It's a lot more commonplace then it was before but it's the system that's made it much easier.
---
What do you think of Star Citizen, to replace EvE online?
---
Note that I described them as conditions where you die, rather than as win conditions. Considering it from this angle is much more useful when theorycrafting in the abyss.
---
The thing CCP thought they could do was pull everything into EVE, do everything with one client, do everything within one game. It was ambitious as hell... probably more ambitious than is currently technically possible and certainly more ambitious than what CCP the company was capable of.
---
Then add to that the worst case of NIH I've ever seen in any company ever. CCP *hates* using other people's code. They hate it so much they would probably make up their own term for "NIH" so that they wouldn't have to use "NIH". Walking in Stations *might* have worked if CCP had built from the Unity engine and then concentrated their own efforts on game play. But I'm also sure that was never seriously considered.
---
The thing with character creation is that EVE has to give you a connection to something other than your ship. When players identify too much with their ships, they're not willing to see them explode which is of course the whole point to the game for a large segment of the player base. So their ship explodes and they get upset and quit. The point to character creation is to get these people focused on the character instead of the ship. It was felt that WiS would emphasize that.
---
maybe, not long before pos/sov there wasn't even an alliance system in the game ;p
---
Man, I’ve been saying this since late 2015. Maybe CCP should let me run their game. Ill make WH great again, LS great again, put null back in their respective place, unfuck the capital cluster fuck, bye bye skill injectors, free to play will stay, pirate BS (10/10spawns) will be rare again (no more haven escalations). Remove all pirate BS nerfs, citadels  will only get 1 timer with max reinforcement timer of 36hrs (0 reinforcement if low power), most HS changes will get reset or ganking will be removed (option to end wardec my attacking the aggressor will stay the same), removal of the ability to build JF, along with many many other changes.
---
Stop saying "soft power" its a stupid idea and totally wrong.
---
To most of us who've been around with Eve, that shows pretty hard. Anytime he opens his mouth to talk about Eve he sounds like a moron.
---
Was there a time when you were legitimately angry because of something that happened during your tenure on CSM?
---
Alternatively, was there a time that you were joyful (meaning, not just had a good time but something really, really happy) because of something that happened during your tenure?
---
Yay! You're back! &lt;3
---
I take offense to this! Some lesser known ones were truly different, my favorite being Time of Defiance which was released in 02.
---
Both. Citadel and Lifeblood created a situation where small scale alliances would create massive gang-worthy targets just by existing (ie, a Fortizar is often worth hitting for no other reason than it's there, much less a Keepstar).
---
Since the smaller alliances couldn't defend those bigger structures, they would lose them. And there's no glory in living in a smaller structure, and no recruiting potential. Try being a small alliance with no Keepstar but try to recruit some super pilots so that you can maybe defend a Keepstar if you had one? It's an impossible Catch-22, and the small alliances in EVE were destroyed by it.
---
I would kill for a rework of the corp and alliance system. There are literally countless QoL and even gameplay possibilties hidden behind the current garbage we have...
---
yikes. Isn't that, like, real corp spy stuff?
---
their reddit ops is max KTA
---
CCP hasn't started down that path yet but I feel like it might be close. There's certainly some things about Invasion that trouble me but I won't be around to see or comment on them.
---
According to Rattati at Vegas, the PS3 life cycle ended more abruptly than previous editions, so they were planning on having more life left in it than what actually happened.  
---
But for as long as they wanted to initially support the game, you would think even what the previous generations did would make them want to start fresh.
---
Autocannons suck because they don't reach past hard tackle range except on large, range bonuses hulls.
---
In hard tackle range you may as well use blasters or short range missiles.
---
Add that to the lackluster hulls (compare the rifter to the breacher for example) and autocannons just suck.
---
jokes on you, that fire is colder than my home state!
---
....*goes back to crying how hot it is outside*
---
I always felt that one turning point for the development of EVE was when Fozzie came on board and for some reason instead of implementing changes that would add to the sandbox at large they would focus on how to change nullsec warfare in specifically in ways Fozzie thought would be the way it should be played. What is your take on this? Is this perception completely wrong?
---
A big old nothingburger. CCP had hired more questionable people before. CCP had hired people with weirder backgrounds before. Why was this particular hire such a big deal? The outcry never made much sense to me.
---
I'm all about judging people based on their actions, not what other people tell me about them. I figured MintChip would rise or fall on her own accomplishments and that's exactly what happened.
---
That seems idiotic.
---
Hee, thanks!
---
Somer came up on a very limited basis during CSM 8's term. At the time, CCP was cooperating pretty closely with them on events and the like, and a lot of devs spent time on their site. The drama came after I left the CSM.
---
It does indeed. &lt;3
---
I efted a lach for this. It would work but making it through the site is hit or miss
---
i like every idea here except for no supers/titans in low, feels antiethical to the idea of the sandbox
---
I have been thinking about this but how? Without cap steeping in is it even possible. Imo the players need to rise up and kill the big boys
---
Why do you think that?
---
Best trailer CCP ever put together. And it could have been even better.
---
He means the solo/small gang meta he enjoyed most, i assume as he mentioned it multiple times.
---
I think it's rather the stakes at play in EVE that killed this. People don't really have problem, they have a problem with loosing *too much*. Gettinh evicted can mean loosing years of progress.
---
Eve doesn't kill play styles. CCP devs kill play styles.
---
&gt;I assume you mean "besides the CSM". Because the obvious answer is "the CSM".
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Other than that, though, no. Not during our term. Things would go from them, to us, to the players. And sometimes, they skipped us. I can remember a few times being surprised by this or that announcement at EVE Vegas or Fanfest. I can't remember specifics, but it happened once or twice.
---
Cheers mate, that's really interesting! I find a lot of businesses get focused on power-users, or a marquee customer. The CSM is a proxy, though even with stakeholder panels in place this trait can emerge. Though could be said the CSM forms a power-user bloc itself. [Focus on this segment is bad for long term health in some cases](https://nick.typepad.com/blog/2006/12/simplicity_aint_3.html). If the biases were clear to you, I'd be concerned.
---
It's crazy you mention the announcements would just go out. CSM is meant to get an open book roadmap to avoid catastrophe, yet there's vision and announcements they still pump out for giggles. gg. Cycles are destined to repeat hey.
---
SISI.
---
\*shrug\* Caps are already banned in hisec. Is that sandbox-breaking for you?
---
Open subreddit rules and scroll down a little :)
---
yes
---
You need handshake lvl 5
---
I’m not sure either how to make WIS properly work - Unity would be out of question, since they’d have to redo the entire client for this. Anyway, I thought that if they wanted this to really shine, they could have outsourced this part to some company that has this know-how — but then there’s the NIH issue you mentioned (I’m aware of it, I try to fight it a bit in my own hobby projects).
---
For me, the ability to interact person-to-person with other people would be an extremely great pause to this ship-oriented gameplay we are so accustomed to too (and this is one of the things is almost driving me away from EVE to other space-oriented games like Elite Dangerous, I’ll tell you); but again maybe it would be too ambitious to have a space-oriented part _and_ a walking part into a same game — well, given the game’s actual plethora of things to do, I don’t think so.
---
Anyway, I wish you good luck on your new journey; I am new as hell in EVE (created by character back in 2013, but went away because of no money, came back in mid-2018), and I really would like this game to thrive for a few more years, because it shows so much potential and it’s a brilliant realization of something I could only dream to achieve myself (a _true_ massively-multiplayer online video game).
---
Most important feature in lacking in regards to graphs is the ability to pull sig and speed from open fits so you could simulate the application of one ship  against several others in one graph
---
And also an expanded capacitor graph that takes neut cycle time and possible cap Booster cycle /reload time into account
---
Apoc looks the coolest. Navy issue apoc &lt;3

&gt;Seagull was a big believer in lore, and was a big believer in pushing more lore into the EVE universe and pushing the story-telling aspects of it. This was just spinning up when I was on the CSM but she spent a lot of time telling us what her future plans were for this. This ultimately manifested in the various stories that sprung up in EVE over the next couple of years, notably Caroline's Star.
---
&gt;I was disappointed that none of these stories were ultimately concluded in a satisfying way, but by that time, I'd been off the CSM for years.
---
Disappointing, but knew this was a problem for them. It's why we're all here really - the story and the world building. I imagine there's a lot of great ideas that are just on the backlog. Wish they'd invest more here. It's what people who aren't playng the game are most interested in about it.
---
makes more sense than hauling
---
Caroline's Star was a fantastic piece of organic environmental storytelling.  I think that kind of thing is pretty underutilized in Eve, which is a shame since it's single-shard nature makes it pretty ideal for creating shared experiences.
---
I don't think people are doing that solely as a "platform" - it's a way, and maybe the main way if you're not otherwise especially well-known in-game, of signaling that you understand the game and can reasonably react to the unexpected ideas that CCP presents. A hoop to jump through - you have to HAVE the platform to pass the test, but understand that much of it will likely be irrelevant or unattainable after the voting.
---
It's a joke. It's an absurd joke. The goal posts for that game have moved so far so fast that it's a wonder that Chris Roberts hasn't invented warp drive. 
---
There's no possible way with the current technology that it can succeed and do the things he wants it to do, much less what it was advertised it would do I've-lost-track-of-how-many-years-ago.
---
And the whale skinning going on in that area is simply not to be believed.
---
So, a replacement for EVE Online? No possible way.
---
Can you prove it?  You seem to be on this kick that Goonswarm Federation is rife with botters. Your head in the sand, that fallacy has been disproven by CCP itself.
---
just spitballing for scarcity of resources.
---
make it so each region has a mineral in it that no other one does,  that mineral is needed for ships specific to that region (nullsec close to amarr has stuff for amarr and blood raider ships. etc)
---
might be...a bit drastic of a change..but its there.
---
or could go less extreme.  same thing with region specific minerals, but they have all minerals, but they got less and more of specific ones.   bit like ice.
---
to much?
---
its one of those rules that you dont break until you know you can break it...this is one of those situations when you can break it
---
Funny, even Sony said "ten years" for PS3. Yes the PS2 lasted like 14 years but that's because it was the default DVD player for like half of all humans.
---
Penis waving contest and getting to say "I was there"
---
Wild guess:  only time they get to use them in combat.
---
Unless you live in Delve, and boson-rat in one.
---
But they won't, will they.
---
I think Fozzie coming on board was a net positive for many years because he brought with him a good understanding of the EVE Online that existed at that time.
---
But I think that understanding is a bit out of date now.
---
Most cruisers are the same way, especially ones whose weapons take cap
---
because you are not there
---
It's nice that CCP is encouraging players to explore new games.
---
I was thrilled when I saw that road map, and more thrilled when I saw Seagull's plan for the immediate improvement of the four core structures of EVE Online. I can't express how happy learning about it made me, or how happy I was to see it on the screen at Fanfest. My initial impression was that Seagull was going to be a better EP than Jon Lander and EVE's brightest days were just ahead.
---
And I can't express how disappointed I was the next year, how unhappy I was the next year after that, and how unhappy and angry I was the year after that.
---
Worked my butt off in game for a long time to afford multiple titans, and alt pilots to fly them all, and fax support...  what other place do I have to use them?  Pinnacle of ships in the game... they’re made to be used but the meta game only gives us few opportunities to use them.
---
Gotta pad them killboards
---
As someone generally negative towards Eve, I will admit small gang is not entirely dead. It's very hard to find and you get punished often for seeking it, but there are a few groups that do it very well. Especially with the Trig ships, small gang stuff is thriving at higher levels of play. (Volta for example)
---
I would definitely not make minerals regional, but perhaps types of moon goo are more/less prominent in specific areas. Full disclosure: I do not know a whole lot about T2 production, but I know that the different races use different T2 components (which require different moon goo inputs). If Amarr/Blood Raider areas had higher abundance of stuff that you use to make Retributions, as opposed to Huginns, that could be interesting, but that doesn't address the issue of "well, I can just set up here and stay here forever."
---
In fact, it could arguably make that worse, as a mega-group could have a near-monopoly on that resource, replicating the T2 BPO problem of a few years ago.
---
Not that much of an issue if you join PVP fleets and loot wrecks. A pair of Initiative Marshalls dropped some real good stuff just yesterday in Geminate.
---
So what's your stance on damage caps and asset safety? Because the way I see it they are necessary evil, removing them would cause a massacre of every single structure of every corp/alliance that's not a part of the big blob.
---
Server wipe. Including character xp. lol
---
no i mean 20 overall options which can be used for every category :)
---
1st is part of the EFT-alike DPS sim. No promises here, because I might have some issues integrating it into current graphs UI, but eventually it will be done.
---
2nd sounds like recording cap sim results and just plotting them, looks doable.
---
1. On an individual player level or very small group of player level, who do you think has done the most to benefit the game and who do you think has done the most harm? (Whether a min/max change, exploit find, betrayal, etc)  
---
2. Same question but on a large scale alliance level.
---
that sentence is carnage
---
Space conga for hours over days.

I rather use autos than lasers

Always a pleasure to watch you guys move.

He didn't understand why someone would third party a fight.....  
---
You cant make this shit up.
---
What amazes me is that they are so damned cheap
---
I enjoy the "event", you know with the Twitch coverage, live threads and so on.  That's if it's a genuine battle with enemies trading blows.
---
I still don't know why anyone could enjoy hauling after the first few hours. 
---
I have done JF service for a past alliance I was in. And it was horrible to do. Even though I made big bank.
---
I hope this isn’t too late, 
---
What advice, if any, would you give to the candidates that make it onto CSM14?
---
&gt; far more work and effort went into the interconnections between EVE and DUST than were ever actually implemented
---
This is so disappointing, I found the EVE DUST connection fascinating and was hoping it was expanded
---
WAIT PYFA ADDED MORE GRAPH TYPES??  
---
Oh dear lord this is not going to do anything good for those of us like you with graph obsessions...
---
CSM 11 was given the last roadmap CCP Seagull produced, which detailed from 2016 to mid 2018.
---
What i was thinking is that instead of the current capacitor recharge over percentage, you had total capacitor over time with modules accounted for, that way you could see how the cap would struggle against a projected neuting ship and such
---
When I was still an alpha I pretty much dabbled in everything, which was cool. The problem is that the reason for that was always that I needed omega for even the smallest steps past a certain threshold of an activity. Explo? Doable, but much better with a cloak. Good luck in WHs without one. Ratting? Sure, but on valium. You never get sufficient ticks. Missioning? Too slow to be profitable. And the fittings you use .. puh. Mining? Enjoy your venture lmao. PvP? You don't really get access to useful ships, as you are basically restricted to T1. Mind you I started playing when they were just introduced, and some of these problems have been mitigated when alphas got access to more ships and skills, but there's still only so much you can do with 5 Million SP. So I would rather. let alphas train all skills (with the exception of the really abusable ones that give you basically passive income) but lower the max amount. This would also introduce to them the concept of juggeling characters, which in it's form is quite unique. Or they could just keep the current restrictions, but unlock the amount of SP. Alphas were supposed to be (or rather perceived as) indefinite demos that show you the basics so you can decide if you want to sub. Currently that isn't the case, as your demo ends de facto the moment you hit that magical 5 million SP.
---
TL;DR: Alpha and Omega are currently two entirely different games, while the former shüould actually introduce you to the latter.
---
hit the nail right there
---
but synthesis was kinda crap :/
---
Tedium &gt; hp
---
They don’t let me mine with it anymore
---
Creepy
---
&gt; Rule 11: Don't be Windsigh. Rule 12: Sometimes it is ok to be Windsigh 
---
thats the most ionfomitive rules i've heard of.....
---
That's already happening and likely gonna get worse ( nobody outside of null made the current CSM and I don't see a change for the next csm tbh )
---
To be fair it's probably true, I don't see it as a big draw :&lt;
---
It can be very exciting when a player is involved (their alliance, their friend, etc) but honestly is boring probably even to most eve players. I think a little support and keeping it up would be neat and a nice little draw. But I don't think putting more resources into it will help tbh.
---
Thank you for this thread and the way you handled this.
---
I have been standing in front of the pc in my work cloths for 50+ min just readying everything here.
---
I appreciate you shedding this light and taking the time to talk to us about.
---
THANK YOU, SIR!
---
If you think about it, it's crazy how CCP let lowsec die
---
Agreed with a good deal. Specifically Indy. Nullsec and empires should feel a bit more disjointed. Resources that shape an empires ship line should be found mainly or only in their space. That war resource wars occur and doctrines are shaped by what's available. Wars are fought for money and resources.
---
Oh. And make a new required resource for Titans with a super low drop rate. Or make them actively require fuel.
---
That's quite a good picture, though.
---
I still get lost in it, jesus christ.
---
every player should loot one ess eventually though, there's just something about it  
---
the 80m isk you get might as well be 8 trillion
---
because... and this might come as a bit of a shock... different people enjoy different things.  
---
i've never enjoyed scanning or exploration, I find it tedious and mind numbing. but there are corporations that specialize in just such activities.
---
Nice.
---
&gt; everyone needs to ban together
---
THey already did that. Banded together with the goon.
---
As an ex-Paladins player, I can say that while Hi-Rez seems to be good at having ideas for things and sticking to them, they seem to have bouts of unstable management where they have many people that want to make big changes, but no overall direction.
---
Also they seem to be incredibly bad at implementing monetization. Under them, I would bet that eve would have either thrived or died completely. Or both.
---
&gt;what other place do I have to use them?
---
I guess you could buy an HG ascendancy set pull all the tank off and driveby DD people?
---
Which is good. Do what you want and fuck other people.
---
Unironically, BOT renters are somewhat fighting back, but not on the level you need to protect people in real time, which is why it's still pretty easy to harass them.
---
The residents of Branch are allied to goons on this one...
---
It's safe to say I have no hope for this game after reading this AMA, but I miss your blogs and when I started out I tried gleaming info from them that was still up to date to learn how to play EVE. Thanks for the early lessons and I hope life finds you in good health. My question to you is where do you see EVE Online in five years?
---
This is starting to feel like a real war now.
---
That's true.
---
Did you ever play Eve before Tidi?
---
You know it's a solution, not a problem?
---
(The problem is that computers aren't really getting any faster. you can do more at the same time, but the speed of a single thread hasn't changed that much. Tidi makes eve somewhat playable at large numbers, rather than it keeling over and dying earlier)
---
Hey I krab hundreds if not thousands of hours for the giant space dildo
---
Gotta put it into use while I could
---
&gt;I still don't know why anyone could enjoy something I personally, do not enjoy
---
good to know you're a retard
---
Getting evicted is one of the most heightened times for a player in eve, it is character building, friendship building and enemy building. It absolutely isn’t the stakes at play, and absolutely is peoples human nature, making them band together attempting to prevent losing all the beans they’ve gathered.
---
Are you aware that everyone in E1's chat channel were also perma banned from the game?  
---
I have friends that were perma banned for just being there.
---
That, I do not know. She mostly works closer to the ground, individual buttons and the like.
---
But yes, removing the Wallet and the Inventory buttons from base Neocom was completely idiotic. Like droolingly idiotic.
---
You know something went horribly wrong when a major null blob choose to flex on test server
---
its not a war without propoganda =D
---
...hey can anyone in panfam draw?....crap i'll have to check later &lt;.&lt;
---
option 2 is to kidnap the person from FOXY.
---
Thanks for your service, blog, time and answers. You shall be missed. o7
---
Honestly I think that all these ideas are great. CCP needs to put more work into balancing the economy of eve.
---
Personally I think that the most important thing to do here is fix fw/low sec so that the game becomes more attractive to new players, and I think that your suggestions are actually good ideas that could work. 
---
The economy in eve definitely needs work though and I like your ideas on VNI ratting and insurance payouts. However, I am not entirely a fan of your suggestions for resource scarcity. I really like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9xxc8s/adaptive_anomaly_respawns_an_idea_that_would_fix/) post by Olmeca on adaptive anomaly respawns that I think could be a fix for resource scarcity.
---
Because due to the mechanics of Eve online, that is the most destructive battle possible, the one situation where the amount of shit the loser will eat blows every single other type of battle out of the water. 
---
In *one* fight, in less than one day, you have a shot at doing more damage to somebody than you normally could over entire wars, over months or sometimes even years of constant fighting. 
---
Basically, it's the massive "GET FUCKED" factor.
---
no it’s not, it’s an international treasure.
---
&gt;the 80m isk you get might as well be 8 trillion
---
tfw ur a real space pirate and not just a fighty drunk with a rifter.
---
So say that this is in the game, and then CCP goes and nerfs/buffs some ships making a specific ship or two very op. Then one null block has access to the resources to build the ship while all others don’t. This would give that particular block too big of an advantage just because CCP went and made some nerfs/buffs.
---
This is why I think that this type of resource scarcity won’t ever work in eve.
---
If everything stays as it is now, EVE's user base will be 50-70% of what it is now and a crisis will start in the in-game economy for lack of players to drive it. CCP will be forced to close the servers or start providing some items through NPC manufacturing.
---
I don’t know your full history so pardon my ignorance, but did you fly in that AT? Or were you associated with Rote Kapelle at the time?
---
And I don’t know who MukkBarovian is but why did you follow him so frequently and what did that consist of that it was such a great memory?
---
Thank you for the kind words. :-)
---
Wow, it's almost like these are silly parody songs made for fun.
---
Take care Jester - thanks for all you did.
---
Getting evicted can definetly be something good to look back to. But it is not fun *while* it is happening. This leads to them forming ever larger blobs to prevent their sandcastle from being kicked over, like you said.
---
I really appreciate how generally positive this thread is.  So many r/Eve posts turn negative fast.  Thanks so much for sharing!
---
I agree wholeheartedly, which is why I put it first. The game presents low-sec as a good place to ease into PVP and other higher-risk activities, but that's simply no longer the case, and continuous lack of attention from CCP will prevent it from becoming that again without a major overhaul.
---
Adaptive anomaly respawn sounds interesting; I will give the post a read
---
Most harm, the answer is the same: injectors. It's created a roadblock for truly new EVE players to join the experience, at the expense of creating more and more and more high income alts. It's stupidly raised the expectations on new players. They can't compete.
---
Most benefit to a small number of players, probably the industry changes. It's made a small number of people VERY rich and created a capability to make yourself a billionaire without too much trouble.
---
Most benefit to the large alliances: Citadel/Lifeblood. It's crazily increased their ranks at the expense of the small alliances.
---
yeah, the thought had occured to me, on one side it could be encouragement to make these groups fight over the area the OP ship mats are.
---
but on the other, specially with citadel spam.  evictions are such a joke now that it would be impossible
---
Where do you see the CCP company (not EVE, the company) in 5 years? 10 years? Also, thank you for your service.
---
&gt; I've never really seen what they gained by removing it.
---
With combat refitting, slots on capitals were extremely multiplicative, which was a design space headache: you can fit full dps unless you think you're about to be primaried, and then you can refit full tank the instant something looks worrying.  If you need to jump out, suddenly your cap regen is 3x what it was before.
---
Even leaving aside the archon blob stuff, when my small alliance dropped dreads on a siege target, we would drop exactly two carriers so everyone could refit, and I guarantee we wouldn't have used it nearly as effectively as experienced nullblob commanders.
---
So, yeah, when they decided to give all the capitals SMAs as part of their effort to make carriers less of a swiss army knife, they also decided to nerf combat refitting.
---
Thanks for the AMA. I have had any I terest in playing eve, kr hardly reading about it, in a couple months, but I read most all of these comments. Great stuff.
---
You hit the nail on the head there, unless a group is extremely outmatched or straight up dead, an eviction is almost impossible in today's eve. So fighting over resources is not something that can take place in eve today.
---
Hmm. Perhaps an Intergalactic Treasure?
---
Short AAR: United Federation of Conifers [.UFC.] (or UFC for the rest of the post) tried to bash a Snuffed Out [B B C] Astrahus' final timer, using a Raven fleet with some combat carriers on their Fortizar sending fighters. Snuffed Out got alerted and rage formed a combat carrier fleet with a few titans and dropped at range of the Fortizar, trying to doomsday the combat carriers on the Fortizar but they all docked up except one which warped off. That one got tracked down by a Snuffed Out interdictor and was dropped by several Snuffed Out dreadnoughts. Rest of the fleet warped to the Astrahus and sent fighters after the Raven fleet which kept pinging around.
---
The titans in the meantime shot the Ravens, getting a few kills while Snuffed Out interdictors kept landing time and again on the Ravens, getting a few kills though most of the time the UFC command destroyers did a good job teleporting the ships away. However Snuffed Out killed those destroyers then fragged the rest of the fleet after a few good interdictor bubbles got most of the battleships. Fighters then swept in and cleaned out.
---
However UFC did not give up and brought back a Cerberus fleet. With news that Pandemic Legion [-10.0] might be joining the party with some Muninns, Snuffed Out decided to jump out its fleet to reship into something more comfortable ;) and came back with its own Cerberus fleet. However Pandemic Legion learning that they might have to fight in equal numbers did an about turn. Sad. UFC's Cerberus fleet got warped on by Snuffed Out, which killed a few of the ships but the rest got away. In the meantime, a lone UFC Revelation decided to warp to the Astrahus to try and bash it only to get dropped by Snuffed Out dreadnoughts. What a hero.
---
UFC decided to change tactics and just got people in Ravens and had them spread out to bash the citadel. What followed was a constant cat and mouse game as the Cerberus fleet probed and warped on Raven after Raven, tackling them and dispatching them one after the other. However in the end the Ravens' persistence paid off and they killed the Astrahus, winning the objective. Snuffed Out killed what it could on the field but UFC had enough so Snuffed Out left, ending the fight.

Since you’re on the subject, CCP Rise used to go by the name Kil2 before he ever became a dev and was definitely my biggest role model when I was getting into Eve and learning about solo PvP. 
---
Not that I expect you to have insight into his personal life or anything but I often wonder if he’s still out there solo pvping under some moniker and we just don’t know.
---
He used to have a pretty good understanding of mechanics and tactics, do you know if he still plays at all or do you think he’s become jaded with Eve after working there for so long?
---
How, in the theoretical universe where resource scarcity is a thing, would you prevent the Imperium - with its hundreds of Delve-hours of production capacity and deep pockets on bot the personal and group level - from steamrolling whatever region contains the resources they need at any given time?
---
i'd like to listen to the story of an ecm pilot who made other people win eve
---
Trolls dissapear when they dont get fed. Wally has become nearly as popular as the Mittani himself (On opposite ends of the food chain) and will continue to feed from this. No good will come from feeding the troll it only makes the troll more present.

Rise is still working for CCP.

And yeah, I'm sure he's still occasionally doing solo stuff in EVE under a different name, though probably not anything like the level he used to.

I truly didn't understand how spoiled I was in TC until the end came. I do thank you and Raknor for that amazing experience. Probably my favorite time playing in my 10+ years of Eve. I salute you, sir.
---
You wouldn't. But at least then they would need to deploy.
---
Interesting +1
---
If I recall correctly, aren't some types of moon goo already prevalent in certain regions, or am I crazy? Regardless, it would need to be paired with a nerf to jump freighters or else people would just import all their shit from Jita (Which is what they do already anyway)
---
You are welcome to steal it for a CSM run this year. I am also a nobody, and have zero desire to do CSM things. Besides, a few candidates last year ran on "fix low sec" platforms and performed... as expected (well below massive null blocs in vote turnout).
---
&gt; However Pandemic Legion learning that they might have to fight in equal numbers did an about turn
---
Sounds about right
---
i love the smell of heathens to enslave in the morning
---
Yes , like I said. The stakes are not too high.
---
Catlos is back \o/
---
I honestly do not know; you may totally be right. As I said, T2 production and moon stuff is beyond my ken. :-)
---
I had an idea that would fix all of that and more actually: no cynos in lowsec
---
Can you make a hover text on the capacitor that shows cap delta so I don't have to pull out my calculator?
---
Personally, I like that idea. The thought that anything larger than a battleship could be used in low-sec / not null was mildly mind-blowing from a lore standpoint as well: why would you let these massive and supermassive ships into these (mostly) empire controlled space?
---
Also Nyxs are not new player friendly. At least battleships can be understood. How the Hel does a new player in a frig get away from a carrier ship?
---
Shouldnt pl be in the dumpster
---
I'd love to assist in something like this, either as a participant, judge, organizer or whatever. That sounds absolutely fantastic. Truly in the spirit of Eve.
---
A third take:
---
There's also a kind of an uncanny valley: stuff with less than 10 people and more than 5 people is frequently not enormously viable, just because it's too easy to get a stalemate and/or you can't afford the support ships needed to force a fight if you want to get kills.  From what I recall, /u/Jestertrek is particularly a fan of engagements of that size, and they depend on a lot of player skills like manual piloting to do well, which means the response you get is usually a bigger hammer or going and hiding.
---
I'd posit that wormholes are another place where this *can* work, but there are a few issues: first, it tends to require a large SP and alt investment, due to the need to scan and recon and stuff.  Second, wormholes really are the big empty, at least up until the moment that someone stumbles upon someone else, so you sometimes have entire evenings where, no matter what you try to do, you don't find anything.  Other evenings, you find something, but you can't get enough people to do anything about it.  Finally, the main way that a small group of friends prospers in wormhole space is to be unremarked-upon.  There are people constantly looking for low-hanging structure fruit, and there are definitely some groups that will stage an eviction just to provoke a fight.  (My own alliance has done this in the past, particularly to groups that we thought were flashing enough capitals around to make for juicy killmails.  We don't do that as much anymore, but also we ended up recruiting one such group wholesale halfway through the eviction.)
---
Thank you, the thread is very helpful!
---
Thank you, it was a pleasure.
---
isn't there this thing called an 'ego'?
---
As a heads up you can create custom filters for your inventory you can click check boxes for. Things like ammo, drones, slot specific modules, drugs, and value of item are a few things that exist.  
---
Containers are no longer necessary.
---
Yeah. That pissed me off too.  If a GM or dev had said "don't be in bonus rooms" I'd have stayed away.  No one had any kind of bad reaction or meltdown in any BRs I was in. No one was asked to do anything I wasn't willing to do (sing a song of their choice, read a wiki article in a funny accent, that kind of thing) And singing ransoms and space court were a long standing part of the game as far as I knew.
---
I had quit any participation months before the ban.  I genuinely didn't know why I'd even been banned when it happened.  
---
When E1 got banned, I thought it was because he was asking people to take pictures of themselves (smeared in mayonnaise?), dude was weird.  
---
I feel like if CCP was clearer about why people are banned then they wouldn't have to guess what the rules were...
---
This is so analogous to the actual system [Hilmar](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Kador/Hilmar#const) in Eve. Offers nothing notable, and is at the head of multiple dead ends.
---
Whilst a radical solution, I think the implementation of finite resources would be incredible. Sure, the null blocs could hold their space and implement a system of 'crop rotation', cycling through different regions of their space for resource extraction every couple of months, and this might be a viable strategy - but if they were to pursue this strategy, it would leave vast swathes of their space open and vulnerable when not in use, making life a whole lot easier for smaller groups and Alliances to move in and contest said space.
---
Alternatively, said null bloc could simply become nomadic, constantly conquering new territory, moving, extracting it's resources, and then moving on to the next.
---
Either possibility is an ideal one and will shake the current, stagnant way of things to its core.
---
As for faction warfare: I hope one day to see some major changes made. I think citadels were a major kick in the teeth for faction warfare, and addressing the issue of citadels could go a long way to giving the capture of systems a purpose again. Banning neutral citadels from low-sec I believe to be counter productive, but certainly making structures belonging to neutral or hostile entities (i.e, a Caldari structure in Gallente system) vastly more expensive to run and operate could discourage the proliferation of citadels and make system control more worthwhile to faction warfare groups.
---
I certainly agree that supers and titans shouldn't be allowed in low-sec. Technically this territory is owned by the empires and as Alq rightly says, I can hardly see the Gallente Federation being all too keen on some band of rogue capsuleers deploying titans in Federal space, low-sec or otherwise.
---
Sadly, I feel like CCP is sometimes too scared of it's own shadow to make any significant alterations to the game at this point, and a CSM dominated by people with a vested interest in the current null sec meta will ensure continued stagnancy in null and a callous disregard for low-sec and faction warfare. Oh well.
---
That would ruin logistics though. If you want Lowsec to be a place where people could conceivably live and get content, it needs to have access to Jump Freighters. Even if you want lowsec to be dead, it's needed to mid to a lot of null space. I think this brush is too broad.
---
But for real, a small- to medium-sized subcap fleet could definitely take on a carrier or a dread or two. Once supers and titans and FAXes come into it... it becomes a show just for the big bois.
---
It's surprising to me to see a fellow vet that doesn't feel at least somewhat bitter towards CCP. I suppose your playstyle has shielded you from a lot of the massive CCP mistakes. I wish you good luck in your small-gang endeavors. I myself and starting to do small gang stuff a lot more and find it to be very fun.
---
I mean his example is getting named the SRP person for well random newbro's, that to me seems perfectly fine and even funny, like it seems such a mild form of harassment at best and maybe it's because I'm used the old eve universe you known the one where if you fucked up that mistake would feel like it mattered you might feel shitty about it for day's because the set back for fucking up was real months of work of multiple people down the drain because you fucked up. 
---
Now you just buy a new super that costs next to nothing, like you, can farm one in like 2 weeks on your own.
---
Fuck off, dude.
---
So what incentive would there be to hold sov, then? If you're going to deploy somewhere else in a month, or three, or however long... What's the point in owning space?
---
I don't agree with banning supers and titans in lowsec. There was a suggestion to force a "front line" in fw by disabling plexes in systems that don't border hostile space. Implement that, and have every active system plus every neighbouring system (perhaps 2 jumps) permanently cynojammed.
---
Beyond that your suggestions are alright but they've been suggested before many times. CCP does not care. They just don't. I'm sorry, that's just the way it is, either live with it or quit the game like everyone else who is sick of the current meta.
---

---
we need some way to end the risk adverse play....something to make the destruction rate outpace the creation(At least for a time to balance things out and clean up the nullsec stockpiles)
---
rorqs for one need a kick in the nuts.  but more than that, we need titans to be used and destroyed, along with other ships.....what would make people willingly die in titans by the dozen
---
also. astras/raitarus. in addition to the OP's changes,  these 2 citadels need to lose the 2nd reinforce cycle. they to cheap and spammable (plus 3 free days of fuel) to give 2 reinforce cycles.  they should be similar to POS in reinforce time(1 reinforce period, 36 hours max) 
---
hell, replace their weapons with POS guns.  that would be fun and make them good vs subcaps
---
The way I'm thinking of it, it would both make low and null sec more logistically challenging, and would also severely hinder capitals without outright banning them.
---
That said, it probably is too broad. Maybe some other kind of cyno limitation like reduced range or some such in lowsec? Maybe remove cyno from low but add / convert some extra null / high direct connections?
---
Don't let the vocal minority change your views about the game.  I've been playing on and off for almost a decade and I still enjoy logging in and doing whatever the hell I'm interested in at the time.  Do what you enjoy and play the game however you want.
---
Q Sent me
---
While I absolutely get where you're coming from, and mostly agree (I'm a programmer myself), at the end of the day you're making something for someone else to use. It's generally good practice to at least consider what they have to say - since they are the ones that know what they want/need from it - instead of dismissing it outright and expecting them to fall in line (not saying you do this, just that Jester made it quite clear there are more than a few CCP devs that do).
---
That being said, of course there's nothing you can do to fix it if you know it won't work, and just hearing the same requests over and over, not to mention the more unsavory things you brought up don't do anything to incentivize people to listen.
---
EDIT: grammar
---
GOTG is there.  we not letting them out &lt;.&lt;
---
Thanks for the replies and insight offered throughout the thread.  One final question,  is there something that hasn't been asked yet that you feel inclined to share?
---
To get the resources out of it during that time? To have somewhere to live? To deploy to areas where you can get content?
---
To clarify: I'm not saying "oh yes, there should be a system limit of 10m units of spod." There could be an increase in production with ADMs as there is now, then a decrease in resource/pirate production over an extended period of time. Think about how hot spots on PI planets work, for instance. That would be rewarding in the short-term for groups that want to use and own their space, but would discourage massive groups from farming a couple systems ad infinitum. I'm talking about a gradual decrease over the period of months after extended exploitation, not "sorry guys, no more minerals here."
---
But they werent though. I still have all the old fcon finances that show how badly they were mis-managed and how no body wanted to fight. Just krab
---
Honestly I don't even know

I guess it's just fun to hang out with your friends on comms and shoot the shit about how trash the game is while you spent hours on the login screen

I don't know the extent to how much things are hardcoded expecting the status quo, but I do know that the extent to which it could potentially be fucked even with the best of coating practices could mean 6,12, Even 18 months before a plug-and-play replacement authentication system could be written, validated, and implemented.  Nonchalantly expecting a 30-day fix even all hands on deck is naive at best.
---
The front-line system doesn't address the overwhelming problem with FW, which is that because of citadels, system control is meaningless.
---
And sure, I know that a lot of these are not particularly new, and yeah, I know CCP and most of the CSM couldn't give a crap about lowsec, but from the way that I have played the game, these are some of the most glaring errors. Saying "LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT" is an incredibly naive and combative statement, especially since the game has, at least in some ways, proven to be fluid. Not every discussion needs to be reduced to a dichotomy of choice, my friend.
---
That was an amazing cluster fuck.
