Yep that should be it, same thoughts here

oh ok

Not having to deal with cap management is a bonus, but I’d recommend trying to fit nanos instead, at least as you become more comfortable with manual piloting. Slicer is such a good ship to learn about different piloting concepts, and cap management is a big one. If you ever have any questions, please feel free to message me in-game (Dustey Chinguatles) and I’ll try to help out.

Merry christmas space friend!
---
I've noticed a marked decrease in escalations from anomalies in NullSec space.  Has the chances of these occurring been changed?
---
I love weathering yellow so this is making me drool.
---
I think if you submit a ticket to CCP informing them that you're going to be using VPN for some period of time then they shouldn't ban you.
---
After B-R this was the case.  Oh wait, no, there were still shit tons of supers in large bloc umbrellas.  /facepalm
---
Merry Christmas! 
---

---
Tomorrow I am going to fly a rifter into Tama. Please no one pod me on boxing day!
---
Not specifically that, but watch most of these videos for a solid base of piloting. https://www.youtube.com/user/ChessurSB
---
Also you can watch some solo battleship roams to get a really good idea of module and target management.

Yea I was in bed with the flu when I wrote that

In the past it was discouraged, because of server load.
---
This isn't the case anymore.
---
When I look at the in game map, I see my current location and my home station as markers. Is there a way to turn this off?
---
Any ideas how to log in if I lost my 2fa?  Trying to come back to eve and submitted a ticket on Christmas Eve eve but no response yet. Hoping they get to it after Christmas.

Ventures are such aesthetic little ships. Even with my rorques I still love the versatile venture. From mining, gas huffing, or being a sick little combat scanning fleet warp in ship that can get in or get out cause of that sweet stab passive, the venture will always be a staple in new eden. Great job on it dude 10/10!

Come join Brave, we live next to your old stomping grounds :)

wat?

you people are really far gone.
---
I liked the cuts in your vid.
---
What do those triangles on your route mean?
---
Thank you!
---
The power of the alpha clone is the power of infinity. If you don't want to be omega, you have to maximize your use of this power.
---
You can purpose build your alpha clones to do specific tasks and do them pretty well. I have well over a dozen I have spun up here and there for various reasons. 
---
ALWAYS USE A BUDDY CODE
---
The buddy code gives you 40 days of alpha skill time for free. That is 1 million SP. A _lot_ of things can be done with "Moment One Alphas". For example, we have a Praxis that hangs in some of the hardest "raid" conten in EVE. 
---
If you want more information, or need a group to do things with (Alphas should team up when possible), please contact me in game.
---
People are, and it's about as bad as you'd expect, but if you're new/poor it's an okay place to start.
---
Lots of configs in the top left. Don't think you can turn off your location, but you might be able to turn off home.
---
Ive made 18 bil, I regularly bought my own tickets.
---
If you buy your own tickets you get people to see the listing is closer to completion, thus much more likely to buy in. This works with high value items.
---
I listed a 6 bil vendetta blueprint for 12 bil.
---
If I buy half my tickets, I am set to break even with  a 50% chance to recoup my item.
---
That's a 3bil in my favor gamble. The alternative is risking losing my listing fee because the auction didnt complete
---
Same happend to me.. Just cancel the mission and restart it and you will be fine
---
And there are people on this earth that cant help being dicks
---
Go to Thera then. You have instantly acces to a lot of holes in multiple regions without even scanning.
---
you inject a character in to a rorqual. buy a rorqual for it. put it in an anomaly, and tell the drones to mine an asteroid. go do other shit until the asteroid pops, then tell the drones to mine another asteroid.
---
do that for 11 accounts.
---
that's the tl;dr version.
---
* add faction tech 2 ammo to FW Militia LP stores
---
* add faction nanite paste to FW Militia LP Stores
---
There is a nice ambiance to it, enjoyed listening.
---
No
---
Rework ECM to either:
---
1. Freeze modules
---
2. Overheat modules (piggyback on current overheating mechanics)
---
3. Find an elegant solution and spend time on it
---
But it's not the same... Intact armour plates a magical. They attract an endless parade of astero bots who supply both easy income and shiny killmails... If you change their habitat it could drive them out...
---
I believe you mean 01:30 on the 27th / 8:30 EST on the 26th. 01:30 on the 26th has already passed.
---
Yes, if you can live with the fact that experienced players with more skill points will rip out your balls through your asshole in PvP.
---
&gt; Paying the sub fee is the only reasonable way to enjoy the game, FTP is essentialy Eve's demo mode.
---
As it really should be. I really don't get the people who have an aversion to being one of the people who actually ponies up the dough to keep servers running and devs on staff.
---
&gt; I currently run 11 mining alts and I make enough isk to plex all of them in 16-20 hours of mining per month.
---
I currently have 1 mining alt. With my main and alt mining together in barges (mostly on moons).... I probably could plex them both; but I just pay for subscriptions and use the isk to buy ships for pew pew.
---
Ignoring the part where I say that as long as you overprice it enough, you can still buy a significant amount of tickets. 
---
At the same time, it is no longer viable to buy half since there is more competition so your raffles don't fill if your ticket price is 2x price off other raffles. 
---
The initial few hours of the hypernet I was raffling off blackops, marauders and other expensive stuff at 2-3x price and buying 30-40% of the tickets. I either made 1-2 bil anyway OR I won the marshal and got 8b+ for free.
---
Aw man.  I figured nothing would make you guys happier than salt from your enemies, which always felt like the Eve way. Looks like I misjudged.   So since self loathing is not the emotion I wanted to trigger: merry Boxing Day PL.
---
GDI, why do you have to be nice, does not help with self-loathing.
---
Happy Boxing day my dude.
---
I think that losing them all inside 15 minutes was perhaps.. the point, for entertainment and the contents.
---
They dont. I reported a set of venture bots for weeks rotated between systems would come in always(even if they were in a pod) warp to the sun before warping(again in a pod even) to the novice. I finally stopped killing their pod as it wasted more time for them to go back to their base then if I had just killed the pod. Reported them for WEEKS were still there when i stopped playing the few alt. Which was before the venture and few change.
---
Or bragging
---
Oh crap.
---
Now I get it. You have an item worth 100kk.
---
Put it in HN  for 150kk.
---
Buy 50kk of nodes.
---
As the result. You will have 100% sell income + 33% chance to simply 'scam' 100% income + leave the item to yourself.
---
Brilliant, simply brilliant.
---
no - you aren't. you aren't gambling anything, if you've covered the costs then as soon as the remaining tickets are purchased (by you or anyone else) you've already made your profit.
---
there's no gambling involved on your end. the only unknown is the amount of profit, not if you're making a profit or not.
---
We hit paysalt bois.
---
vry cool :))
---
Eve IS real.  I KNEW IT!
---
Havent played in 8 years, been thinking about getting into it again now that my daughter is getting ready to go to college and I have more free time, is it worth a return? How much will I have to adjust?
---
Too close to the collision model though, unrealistic.  CCPlease!
---
I don’t understand why all your fights are including faxes. What objectives are you fighting for that you encounter this?
---
It was stated at Vegas that part of the reason they werent done yet was because additional work was needed in order to keep them balanced. I suspect that that work lies in tweaks tot he implants/regen formula.
---
Just try it! You don't need to subscribe, log in as an alpha and play a little to get a feel
---
oh god could you imagine the triumphant return of the regen tank svipul
---
So many guys that didn't full Neut fit their bhaalgorns... you are injecting +150 GJ/sec with that heavy cap booster and 3200s. A bhaal without implants gulps 306 GJ/sec of cap.  If those bhaal pilots had just fitted for what that ship was designed for instead of trying to feel cool with more DPS they might have actually killed you.
---
Why are you so upset about a feature no one is forcing you to use?
---
Any fight over a citadel outside highsec lol.
---
bullies breath air just lie you do :)  
---
No bullies feel better because others feel worse, i dont even care for others. if they feel worse or not about it is not part of my equation its not in there.
---
You are replying to different people. Faxes are killable, but not "balanced" because they require disproportionate resources to kill compared to how much they cost and how much remote reps they put out.
---
Eves "toxicity" is unique.
---
A huge majority hates the guts of their opponents CHARACTERS, not the person behind it. (retards on reddit are an exception)
---
A good example is how people are at eachothers throats ingame for a year, but then share a night of beer and laughter at fanfest.
---
Lego veldspar.
---
Now this is a setup i need to hear about
---
&gt; It only takes 1 3200 per rep.
---
you can cycle like 4 reps with one 3200 dude
---
Lego Cormorant, because of it's symmetry.
---
Is Dread Ratting a thing? Especially in J space (I.e in C5/C6 holes?)
---
If not, what's the best way for day trippers for take on C4+ holes?
---
Alas the curse of secret santa.
---
Put effort and work into yours. But you get something someone picked up in a minute.
---
Rorqual
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You're already mining Reddit for those sweet, sweet upvotes.
---
The empty plastic bags of your assembled legos are the cloaky soe ships.
---
Yes very much so, hefty investment though.
---
Day tripping is easiest into C2 and C3s, if you do go for C5s then you are usually looking at a couple of Nestors or Rattlesnakes, after that any more characters can fly dps ships (Leshaks being the usual choice).  All usually have MJDs fit for evac purposes if jumped.
---
It is possible to solo C5 sites in a Marauder but requires pimp and is pretty vunerable.
---
ooooh   
---
interesting, thanks
---
Genuinely didn't expect them to use drones. Wasn't even aware Corvettes had a drone bay!
---
There's too much peace and understanding already. I mean test has probably blued the drifters by now and is working on the trigs. More chaos, anarchy and less pacts is what's needed.
---
That’s just a plastic bucket of random lego pieces, four radios tuned to different stations at max volume jammed inside and dicks drawn on the outside as well.
---
Imagine the logistics behind moving a cap fleet from the north to the south without going through ls.
---
It would ignite itself once built!
---
A bigger one, that is legit one of my favorite looking ships in the game and I don't know why.  I love ORE ships.
---
Been down for a few hours, I tried using it at about uhh 6pm GMT and it wasn't returning any orders.
---
I agree with the OP, I'm not sure why people in the comments seem to believe it's the player's job to find a work around for weak design instead of design's job.
---
Has to be RTM or Hypernet.
---
You are just assuming the shield slaves are going to apply a certain way, I believe the whole reason for these implants taking so long to implement is that CCP has been working out a way to avoid all or most of the issues you have presented, it's premature to cry about something that doesn't exist yet
---
Pulsars are going to be more aids than they already are.
---
Another new player in a Titan?
---
I really want to PvP more. Not just fleet stuff. Any tips on how to find target's? I've ran ships from low sec to null home and found system after system empty! I can probably get a few friends to work with me. How do I find a good target system or a good place to gate camp etc?
---
So your logic is that someone who wonders if it's realistically possible to run with an alpha, to avoid subscription - should just inject into a super or a rorqual and grind for 16-20 hours a month to pay for subs instead.
---
This is what spodbrain looks like, people.
---
Gambling is technically rational because it is a form of entertainment. Economically, consumers derive satisfaction from it and assuming that the average person won't make rational purchase decisions to maximise their 'gambling satisfaction' with the least amount of money spent is simply stupid.
---
Yes, some people will make completely ridiculous decisions like buy high sell low but that is not the average. In most cases, it's safe to assume that the Hel with fewer remaining tickets will sell first with everything else being equal.
---
Realistically, what WOULD make it worth it? 
---
What number comes to your head when you hear “I’d do that again for X dollars” ?
---
Don’t be shy. I’m not saying I’d pay it but I’m more curious at this point
---
Oh man, I remember this when it was still happening. What alliance did he end up joining?
---
I think I like this new hypernet.
---
Well yeah he may have push his assumptions too far by using such an affirmative statement with little evidence to back it up, but that's still valid concerns that MAY happen, and speaking about that beforehand doesn't sound like a bad idea to me
---
I don't know, the article doesn't say.
---
Right, but also at tremendous cost. A full set of HG snakes on a ship that can fully take advantage of that speed boost costs 3x what the hull is worth.
---
And you DO lose the pod on ship loss outside of LS, unless you're killed by a group that doesn't know how sabres work.
---
Agreed
---
[http://evemaps.dotlan.net/](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/) select a system, find something with a lot of jumps per 24/h or rats killed etc, play with the filters as you like.
---
Some people enjoy it. You don't. And that's fine. Others do. And that's fine too. Too many people dictate what others should do to have fun in an open sandbox MMO.
---
You could just buy Plex and throw them in your Plex vault, or create and alpha account and just use it as a bank
---
Corax!

Best looking ship out there!

That was his first post.
