no its on field at the AT.

no, i meant C18.

Define then please for the obviously unenlightened

Don't bother, you can always count on malcanis cringeposting on reddit when it's about INIT., classic bloated nullbrain ego

26000+ dps if that was flown by a player, wow

In theory they are actually combatting the INCREDIBLE amount of isk generated into the game via blue loot and bounties .

Feel free to try it out.

Let me mine from my phone so i can go out and pretend to be a productive member of society while krabbing
---
at is trash and a very small portion of the population watches it , it should just be kept gone and have players make one if they want
---
But then if it‚Äôs an android app people can just get a bunch of phones, leave them running for all of your accounts OR boot up Nox emulator and run very small/not graphically intensive app &amp; make fuckton of isk thus driving plex to 10m+ a piece
---
I'm so sorry for your loss.  \\o
---
Sorry whats the AT? I've only been playing a year.
---
Amrast is gud boi tho
---
They were literally sitting on the keepstar waiting for tapi to show up to the timer but they never did.
---
Done got vonholed
---
Please show us
---
I think what you can take away from this, is he loved spending time with you. Cherish that. Pass it on when it is your turn to be the grandpappy, so they will have those memories to cherish as well

No wonder shit doesn't get done. Go to lunch have a few and say fuck it after that!!!

If someone's running a Ferox fleet but I don't have good hybrid skills, can I bring a Drake instead?
---
People haven't figured out that safe ratting = inflation.  
---
Plex has remained the same price for years. It's the value of ISK, materials, etc that has actually gone down.
---
I got to be honest Grath, "Dipshit" kinda disappointed me
---
I think you might have missed the joke (which was that this is the sort of reaction that the Drifters got).

o7 may he not be forgotten in new eden
---
It was.
---
A Porpoise is great for AFK mining if you're training up to an Orca. Unlike barges, you don't have to pay much attention. Just park it on some 0.5 moon Arkonor, walk away. Much harder to gank than any barge besides Procurer. Cheaper but with the same skill requirements as Orca.
---
Hey Big Country, it's me Nail. Sorry for your loss man.

So this is the end of any facsimile of resistance from Winter Co.

Whos bad the FC thats needs 25 more dudes to fight an already even fight or the dudes willing to take the fight outnumbered. ssshh little testling

Why don't you commit to that statement you made back when you were an edgy teenager wearing black eye shadow?

Now I know what BFA means. Didn't know there was anything past Legion, was wondering why everyone in Classic kept talking about BFA

Just so wrong. I got my first solo kill in lowsec at 1m SP.

"There's barely any \[satire\] in Starship Troopers"
---
It's not in the 'genre' of satire, it is an action movie.. But it's full of satirical subtext.  Like, another example,  at the start of the movie when the students are sitting in class getting taught:"Violence solves all problems"by Michael Ironside,  and hes explaining how hiroshima was the greatest example of this and is basically espousing how 'Might makes right' and their military society is the one and only way for us to proceed...
---
You understand the humans are also the invaders in starship troopers?  You hear people saying it on the state-sponsered tv that the bugs are reacting because we invaded their territory...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You watch it and you think it looks like a great fascist society that you'd like to be part of; you're free to think that.  What country do you live in btw?
---
There's -so- much satire i couldn't possibly list it all...  But,  here's a very detailed review that might convince you why so many people understand the film is satire:

Would you have preferred Cunt?
---
Oh thank fuck it is you.
---
big yikes fit :S
---
I guess I would be this mad too if some space nerds made me sit and watch as he railed out my daughter **and** my wife at the same time in my own bed room. Luckily, I'm not so much of a Cuck as to sit there and take it while I BM on reddit.
---
Sympathies for your loss. I've also found that Eve can be enjoyable for those who don't play. When my wife and I both played (as lowsec pirates), our girls would watch us play like it was the best cartoon ever. Every time we jumped someone, our youngest would screen "SHOOT THE SPACE PIRATE!" and I kept having to tell her, "No, honey. Mommy and I ARE the pirates." They're both grown up now, but they still ask me what's going on in the game; despite the fact that they've never played a day.
---
why yes, yes i would have!!!
---
Your personal experience and observations don't compare to his narrative.
---
I want the marketing job where you get to advertise the same shit every year and the only thing that changes is the version of PowerPoint you are using.
---
That‚Äôs some cool anecdotal evidence you have there. :^)
---
I thought eve was just a Netflix add-on?
---
&gt; Panfam is eating potatoes in Dronelands even they gave up Tribute and Tenal without fighting.
---
heehee
---
&gt; The reason TEST wants to fight us for over a year is that they believe in the future ‚Äòultimate war‚Äô we will form a pincer with goons to attack them.
---
God, that sounds like some decent content. But the reality is that we wouldn't be able to defend our sov against goons solo regardless if we have Detorid or not.
---
Someone should teach you dinobrains how to post properly.
---
o7 RIP to you're grandfather bud.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

AT ship like the fiend may be fielded through the tournament and are a huge asset as they are as rare as they are strong and can return a match In your favor if you risk to field them.

Imagine a coalition that outnumbers winterco, that still needs to suck them bee guys‚Äô dick to win

k     
---
No, I just decided you weren't worth a thought out response so I gave you a meme one instead.
---
I'd like something that pulls up to date market data that can filter by specific location/region/system etc. That's it- just a mobile market browser.
---
Imagine not being able to identify why that is. It's not like tzs are a thing at all.
---
Of course it's not, it's just me listing some of my personal gripes and an idea on how to fix it. I came out of the thread knowing a lot more about some of the other problems in the game and the errors in my thinking.
---
Wouldn't WinterCo have the exact same TZ issues, just in reverse?
---
Your narrative is lacking.
---
TZ tank too strong. Norus even said it. We dunked all their guys who play in our time zone, we just can't alarm clock to chtz every day during a workweek to kill a single citadel.
---
CCP has created a system that forces you to build huge shitty blue blobs in order to accomplish anything.
---
You're almost there bud. Take it one step further. You missed the key point that the defenders get to set the the tz for the timers.
---
&gt; What exactly is the goal of the game?
---
What's the goal of life? Eve is an open-ended sandbox.
---
My grandfather served in the Korean war as well, my condolences. Reminds me yet again that his time is drawing short. I hope you have the best of memories with him and that you are always able to reflect on those when those feelings of loss creep in. I wish you the absolute best for your and your grieving family.  o7

Edited for autocorrect
---
If he‚Äôs dying in a dommi, don‚Äôt see why he‚Äôd do better in a VNI.. it‚Äôll just amplify whatever issues he‚Äôs having
---
Absolutely dude, there's a ton of mechanisms to get you up to speed, and some really great groups that are purely focused on helping you find your feet &amp; get started. Recommend jumping in, giving it a go as Alpha and joining the "EVE University" corp/alliance. 
---
It's absolutely a blast, and the most unique game you'll play.
---
Its in an interesting spot, to say the least. Being a huge carebear has moved to nullsec, where its unironically safer than highsec, so if thats your thing theres plenty of places.
---
You're thinking of u/wingspantt who did the videos. Covert ops ganking has changed quite a bit since then as well.
---
They do. Both sides do. Winter Co cannot do much in EU and US TZs. They cannot kill structures in their own staging.
---
And because entisis warfare is as it is, Legacy is trying to RF as much as possible, so that they is a chance of timer appearing at the edge of the timezone. That's the only way to do it without alarm clocking.
---
The good thing is, if you do like it your can wallet warrior your way to whatever you want since skill injectors exist. Try and alpha, see if you like it.
---
hey fuck you buddy, i agree with you.
---
I read your post and frankly choked up a bit. My father in law passed from ALS almost 1 year ago. I spent many days and nights helping care for him. I always had my laptop. He wanted to know what I was doing so I rolled a new character and we did the tutorial (mostly he watched and smiled) together. I showed him videos of fights and we cruised around New Eden. Since he could no longer speak he gave me thumbs up when we saw something that he really liked. It was a truly  an enjoyable and memorable time.   EVE is a great community.  
---
I am truly very sorry for your loss. 
---
If you ever want to chat feel free to dm me.
---
We dont kick anyone for losses?
---
don't bother, ccp gave their balls to PA when they kowtowed to botters
---
Cool, so by the "logic" on display, WinterCo can't contest Legacy structures without help.
---
Botters already exist, doubt a lot of change will come with this
---
First of all, I would advise against asking this sort of questions here. R/eve has became a salt mine. Everyone is as salty and bitter as humanly possible. You may get answers that are less than civil, and often soaking of salt.
---
As for the state of the game, why don't you try, and see yourself? Alphas are a things now, and you may see how many aspects of the game look like today. Grab a something fast, and try to move around.
---
I think the AT is a lot of fun to watch either way
---
No Value are align with Unspoken and Rote, they are not blue to the Forsaken mini coalition.
---
Eve is doing fine though it's seen better days. This sub is probably not a great place to ask because it's where most of the vocal minority lives.
---
Yes. That is exactly true, but they aren't the aggressive party and they are hyper focused to one tz to a degree that Legacy and friends aren't so they must cast a wider net to get people in that tz.
---
no
---
Blow it out your ear, mate.
---
dude r/eve would be 1000000% better if it was just memes and not "REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE" and "look we killed capitals in our blob"
---
If you liked doing pve, it's still the same, maybe better. 
---
If you liked doing pvp, it's seas of shit and the rare good fight.
---
&gt;The reason TEST wants to fight us for over a year is that they believe in the future ‚Äòultimate war‚Äô we will form a pincer with goons to attack them
---
Cats out of the bag now, bois. Goons are gonna pincer TEST. We're fucked. Jita plan engaged.
---
&gt;we don‚Äôt need to use PL super fleet moving footage in our videos anymore
---
Wait wat
---
Seeing that astra on their staging keepstar grid for almost five months now I would say yes, they have problems with Legacy structures.
---
The goal in eve is what you set for yourself to do. 
---
I cannot suggest ways to make isk without knowing what you like to do. General rules apply: High level combat missions, scannable combat sites, escalations from scanner sites, PI, mining. 
---
The eve market works the way it works. No stock market, that's just a price ticker. Players are bastards and buy as low as they can and sell as high as they can. That's the eve market.
---
And when I say as low as they can, I mean by pennies more than another guy. Even by one penny. Or half a penny. Or 1/10th a penny.
---
Oh no, you got baited :(
---
All CCP has to do is rebalance the moons such that Delve is worthless and Esoteria magically becomes the richest region in the game, then have DurrHurrDurr takes control of Test.
---
With his burgers
---
I thought that was funny AF.
---
haha yeah it was totally that bug. too bad velsh who literally always records magically lost the footage due to ‚Äúhard drive failure‚Äù immediately after his fiend died so there‚Äôs no way to prove he didn‚Äôt die because he accidentally hit his mwd instead of his ab ;)
---
We managed to continue to spread the fire down to Cache for a time though and kept the guerilla active in the Spire after Panfam kicked us out from ER with the help of their new members TRI/SLYCE. In the end, Winterco and Panfam were fucking tired of us and they activated their blob card and we didn't have any choice of GTFO from there. Panfam won a Pyrrhic victory here ; they lost a lots of rental money, a lots of structures, abandon 3 entire regions and the Spire was fuck for months. For Winter, we delayed their colonization of Cache and spread chaos indirectly up to Outer Passage.  
---
This is was the result of the Eviction Wars. They want to got their revenge over a dead sotiyo and blob our staging; Then we ignite a fire who length for months.
---
Make it 250 plex per omega and see what happens
---
I know, right?
---
Heya!
---
Do it. 
---
Understand most of the people who say to not join in the fray don‚Äôt log in. Take your time, there‚Äôs a lot to learn and a ton of things to do even as an alpha ( free to play). 
---
See you in New Eden!
---
We shoulda named it "Barnacle"
---
But isnt rmt and botting LEGAL in china and serenity?????? I believe it is. And I don't remember seeing AOM's name on the CCP report about botting. 
---
BTW your english sucks or google translate thought u were a bot.
---
&gt;CCP has created a system that forces you to build huge shitty blue blobs in order to accomplish anything
---
'sure that's why Test blue everyone
---
What‚Äôs fun about bringing overkill to a forgone conclusion? Pretty lame and sounds boring for both sides.
---
except this wouldnt change anything.. test would just give up eso and move into delve
---
There is only lose-lose game. Tons of grind and few of fun.
---
M8 you should try something else.
---
Ask rote... they sold our space before we could lmao
---
When the meme posts have a better ratio then your actual posting it's time to stop.
---
"a bit"
---
Actually yes. You either blue everyone, or you get evicted and have to move and keep moving. As an example, see winterco, who are currently being evicted even with timezone tanking and will get pushed right back into drones where they will slowly die.
---
Get blues or die. That is the game CCP has created.

I use this fit.  Just kill the web towers from from max range in 2nd to last room.  You can kill structure in last room without clearing anything else, just fly slightly  to one side so you dont aggro everything and tank will hold fine.  A quick tip kill all non battleships before deploying drones and they will hardly ever get aggro unless the bs haven't red boxed you already.

What makes us tools exactelly?
---
Eve has lost too many good souls o7
---
I've been in a lot of places in this game. Ive flown with many many people. And our group here in FE is the least toxic group and the best bunch of dudes I've ever had the honor of flying with. So all you guys posting we are this or that. We dont give two flying fucks. We are getting exactelly what we want.
---
You can also always count on Frank Meyer cringeposting on reddit when it's about INIT. Something something WHer btw something.
---
Well well , your English is not anyway better but sounds like a shit.  they are doing RMT for real in our world now and you still insist on your narrative
---
I think it‚Äôs more complex than this. The value of ISK has gone down vs PLEX, for example, but has gone up overall because mineral value is decreasing (e.g. 25bil now buys you 2 supercarriers, 5 years ago it only bought you one - this is because of rorquals). So for most other things the buying power of ISK is greater.
---
But the demand on PLEX has also changed. When prices were low, PLEX could only be used for game time and MCT essentially.
---
Now it can be used to buy extractors, SKINs, etc. Nothing has happened to increase the supply, but it is being consumed for all of these other items and services that they added to the NES.
---
I think arguably the biggest additional stress on PLEX price is SP farming, since they require monthly extractions - and extractors only come from NES via PLEX-based transactions. So now instead of 500 PLEX for the account...that farm is consuming 500 plus 12 extractors every 4 weeks (4 per character slot). That SP goes into the market but cannot be converted back into PLEX.
---
FWIW, after counting the extractors, an SP farm costs 1844 PLEX/month (game time plus 12 extractors) - so they are more than 3.5x the drain on supply that a regular account used to be. Actually it‚Äôs even more than that, since I didn‚Äôt count the 2 MCTs/month that are required for the additional training slots that are also consumed (don‚Äôt know MCT cost by heart and I‚Äôm not at my PC).
---
I enjoy it. But I sub, I recommend wormholes or low sec.
---
You assume he's talking about weed.  How you you know he's not a penis puffer?  Did you just ASSUME, bro?
---
No no, the hard drive failure was for the imp footage, not the fiend footage. Silly Avery.

I somehow knew that blaster victor would end up being what you meant
---
Sorry for you loss friend o7
---
&gt; we wouldn't be able to defend our sov against goons solo regardless if we have Detorid or not.
---
Evac confirmed.  
---
See you in Innia.
---
Hey kid, we tried.  
---
CCP's support of player run tournaments has been so shoddy that even the maniacally optimistic guys who do that kind of stuff gave up.
---
CODE? Isn't there like one corp in there that's actually doing smallgang / general PvP other than ganking miners in highsec?
---
If we go by the sov maps they have Perrigen Falls (at least parts of it, idk) and Oasa. Allies that then surround them will be NC., TRI and SLYCE. I'd imagine they'll be set as blue anyways if this happens. + PH won't be that far away either.
---
I still have 120 ships in PR- from the good ole' days.  I'm okay with this, all except for the "moving" part.  I'd rather step in front of a large moving object than move all the ships and caps I've acquired since the good ole' days.
---
Not sure how I can poll alphas who have quit by logging into the game...since they‚Äôve quit
---
Why don‚Äôt you do it and get back to us :)
---
Do you guys even still play? o.O
---
we need a zkill comment called "Vonhole'd"
---
tell him to get proper fit next time
---
I'm guessing "That Spaceship" since it was "that spaceship game" :)
---
How many people do you know have at least 10 farming accounts? How many 100? Do you know how much time it needs to manage those?
---
Do you know what's the profit per month? You know it's negative?
---
Lol, Rorqual mining is more profitable.
---
That's such a hilarious lie
---
From SMMRY.com:
---
&gt;Our enemies are maintaining the war fatigue better than we are doing.
---
&gt;As I've said last time, we are in the longest entosis war.
---
&gt;Wind is always telling me it's the weakest kid who gets bullied in EVE. I did some reflection on the current situation this year and it seems any Chinese powers is the weakest in their war just in different ways.
---
&gt;We are the weakest alliance in the rest of the group- no.1 no.2 no.3 then there is WC. AOM attacks us because we stood out the most in this war against legacy- therefore I choose to spend time attacking them.
---
&gt;We did not change the general situation of the war.
---
&gt;The reason TEST wants to fight us for over a year is that they believe in the future 'ultimate war' we will form a pincer with goons to attack them.
---
&gt;There will be a lot of diplomatic conversations to do in the future which will bring changes to the war.
---
Seems accurate tbh.
---
Maybe injectors helped to at least save what we have today?
---
You don't have to blue everyone per se to not get evicted? I highly doubt that TEST would all of a sudden lose some major war forcing them to go somewhere else if they hadn't called for goons when something important is happening.
---
Sure you had PL + Skillu or whatever that got a Keepstar or something a while ago. But no way those two entities can evict TEST. If for instance they were able to you really don't deserve to say in null anyways based on the numbers TEST can form vs them.
---
I don't pay much attention to the conflict down there. So I have no idea how often goons are there, etc, etc. in reality. But to me it seems like Fraternity have no chance if those bee guys are in fact called in to help for more important objectives when you should be able to do those by yourselves.
---
If by not being able to quit this god forsaken game you mean playing... then kinda
---
So Fraternity might have a hard time hitting TEST due to timers being set in their timezone. At the same time it will be hard for Fraternity to hit, let's say, structures and stuff anchoring in their own space, used to constantly harass them?
---
o7 His time as passed but remember him always. Fly Dangerous.
---
I have no idea what that was supposed to be.
---
i dunno man maybe you just aren't funny
---
I'm fucking hilarious. And that's just looks.
---
the most battle hardened group in eve
---
I had fun playing Eve today. If you join, you probably can to.
---
Why does CCP have to sponsor the AT at all, couldn't a alliance sponsor and run security for their own tourney?
---
It's not an MMO like you're used to. Endgame content is kinda a thing, but not really. If you're into actually being apart of a group, it's definitely a good game to get into, even just starting now. 
---
I think it requires more of a PvP mindset to actually enjoy the game, though. PvE content is there, but mostly repetitive and dull. It's a means to PvP.
---
If that sounds like something up your alley, join up under alpha and check it out for free. Then decide if you want to go further down the rabbit hole.
---
it is especially brutal for us USA east coasters...at least in california the ops end and it still isnt day time
---
Did you miss the part where hero coalition got farmed for ages by PL because not enough blues?
---
When test got evicted from Vale for not enough blues?
---
When the north came down the evict us, and we finally had enough blues and PL was broken at UALX?
---
Get more blues or get fucked, has been the sword hanging over test's head for years. Now though, it hangs over other's heads. Doesn't feel so good anymore, does it?
---
We finally got enough blues to not get evicted every 6 months. If that means killing eve and all content in the process, then it was worth it. And hey, if you want to break this cycle, all you gotta do is get enough blues to evict us again, no problem, right?
---
As everyone keeps pointing out, those bee guys tend to show up when panfam shows up.  For most of the war, panfam was defending FRT before Goons ever brought fleets.
---
Durr would probably sell us for isk. Good plan.
---
'TEST friends are very bitter and suggest we are all bots'
---
That's funny, considering Noraus himself openly admits to botting as well as actively harbouring botters, has been banned for RMTing already. His lead FCs and corp CEOs has openly said he personally bots and furthermore organises sanctioned botting groups within Fraternity.
---
Best Answer Don't Ignore
---
I agree 100%.  
---
The game is what you make it.  I think if you are open to exploring lots of different things you will have fun.  Eve is actually a very cool game with lots of interesting people.  
---
If you are an entrenched bitter vet, with a single niche gameplay (often us on Reddit) you may find frustration in Eve (and on Reddit).   I would recommend not letting it bother you too much.  
---
Dive into the rabbit hole...see where it goes.

What was the last agreement broken by tapi?

I had the same concerns when a friend got me started with Eve about three years ago.  I wondered how I could possibly compete in a game where others had been training their skill queues for years and had huge alliances already built.  Honestly, these things hardly matter.  Skill and play the way you want.  You can industrialize, fight, whatever.  Part of the fun is deciding how you want to spend time skilling, what you want to fly next, and making friends along the way.

Implying he would use it
---
you realize you are asking a bunch of cultists whether or not you should join their cult?
---
MFW you think FRT don't bot
---
Not winning fast enough, but then it's 'stop winning so fast'
---
So much truth in this. No GM in my case. It's tougher if you aren't available for a regular TZ (US, EU, etc). Good luck getting into anything other than a crappy blue-blob null alliance.
---
We're pro homo‚Äînot everybody can match that claim. We even went a step further and made it mandatory. im gay
---
You talk as if FRT + PL + HORDE is a 100 man Indy corp lol
---
We don't? Read the replies by Vily.
---
You didn't deny FRT never fought alone
---
imagine being so paranoid you think the only way to not get evicted twice a year is to blue a quarter of ns and be effectively blue to another half. Yes indeed its all of eve against you dinoboy, make sure to anchor correctly or you might get evicted after all.
---
not sure what else i expected from a leddit alliance really
---
Cunt
---
Do you really think anyone gives a damn about what happened on another server?? I am in AOM space all the time and have never encountered a bot. In FRT space every other system has a bot, thats why after blackout FRT adms dropped sooo fast and were never raised.   Your narrative and entire argument is crap, stop shitting up reddit, undock in 03 and come find me.  Im the one toasting the ihub in your staging uncontested.
---
Wait, is this a joke?  Someone may have contracted you a legitimate ship and skin for it.  You just have to read it to make sure you won't pay out the butt for it.
---
Also, what do you mean by:
---
&gt;Enter wormhole and exit immediately as security measures are active.
---
Did you warp to one of those Unidentified Wormhole things on your overview?  If so, that's not a "real" wormhole.  Wormholes have to be probe-scanned from Cosmic Signatures in your probe scan menu.  The only "security measures" I can think of is someone put a warp bubble (anchored mobile warp disruptor) on the hole to help control who comes in or goes out and whether they can warp.
---
Being accused of eating potatoes while assisting in a conflict I don‚Äôt care about really makes me want to go eat potatoes in drones.
---
&gt; When test got evicted from Vale for not enough blues?
---
Before my time tbh, but fair point I suppose. Without knowing most of the details.
---
&gt; If that means killing eve and all content in the process, then it was worth it.
---
Oof.
---
&gt; When the north came down the evict us
---
Ah yes Skillu after torching drones + PL with ~2.3k characters (current numbers.)
---
When TEST supposedly deployed to Geminate with the goal of ''beating'' PH into giving up highsec or whatever, they didn't run anywhere to get additional blues, other than having members of their coalition join in from time to time.
---
&gt; And hey, if you want to break this cycle, all you gotta do is get enough blues to evict us again, no problem, right?
---
Seeing as the two largest coalitions would help each other if an eviction were to happen, not so sure that is even possible. Whatever floats your boat.
---
gonna need some citations there bud

Neocom is great.  The new CCP app lets you adjust your skill queue remotely, which is cool.
---
RIP what a bad.... He should move to provi
---
If it were me I'd say wait until CCP figures out which direction they're taking the game, as the direction it *was* going was stale stagnation and 0 content, then when they tried to fix it about 10k players rage quit, leaving 15k of us to have our fun.  
---
That was unacceptable to the game company so they rolled it all back and theres no indication they have any idea what to do to end the stagnation thats choking off the game.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackout_(drug-related_amnesia)
---
it's a joke :D
---
by security measures I mean the NPC that spawn after the 15 mins timer guarding data sites and such.
---
I've seen at least PH down there a few times, one of the times they wanted to get rid of some TEST structure that was anchoring. No fight due to Fraternity not being able to contest. Timezone tanking yay!! (Not blaming anyone here.)
---
Before the weekend or something, correct me if wrong, someone posted a goon ping here as they were coming to help TEST with some important objective. A fight never happened I don't think, you probably know better than me. I had a sneak peek at PH comms and I saw a ping at least one or so hour after goons pinged about the same objective.
---
Also seen a few BRs that have AoM on there, forming similar numbers to TEST. Yet another alliance that literally consumed all of the Chinese server. That was given some space to grow. Already doing a good job replicating what they did over on that other server ;)
---
NPCs spawn at gas sites.  Data/Relic sites either have NPCs or don't.  Data/Relic sites named after factions/pirates don't have NPCs.  Ghost/Sleeper Data sites do, but they spawn randomly within 3 minutes after warping in and/or decloaking.
---
FRT dropped structures in our old 08- staging a couple months ago, anchored citadels in Immensea, Tenerifis and Fey. They're gone now, even when they were tanked to *their* timezone. I've lost count how many Fortizars of FRTs we've killed in 46DP, in their timezone; just FI.RE and Legacy. AOM only recently joined in on the fun, and now Noraus (who broke the NIP with AOM) has found someone he can kick in his timezone. From what I've seen, AOM doesn't need much help, and holds Omist just fine, but if Noraus thinks he can bully the new kids on the block, we're gonna be there, too. His obvious obsession with AOM is readily apparent and it's bad blood from Serenity. AOM kicked his ass right off the server. Fraternity. is a paper tiger, AOM is not.
---
What else?
---
&gt; Ghost/Sleeper Data sites do, but they spawn randomly within 3 minutes after warping in and/or decloaking.
---
ah I thought the timer was 15 mins after entering the worm hole and stay up continuously after that. thanks for clearing it up.
---
Imagine still being buttmad over a war that took place 2-3 years ago
---
Actually - I wonder if the translation or transliteration has to do with the pronunciation of "spod" vs "Spud." Maybe they're saying "munching spod" and it got mistranslated to "eating potatoes."
---
That is the point though, it has happened to test multiple times now. It is isn't paranoia when someone actually shows up to piss in your cheerios every few months.
---
It's like 85% solid, 10% questionable, 5% bad. And in an age of chaos, maybe it's worth the throw of the dice.
---
Wrath is proof that a good story can cover up a lot of other mistakes.
---
Skillu? What are you talking about? Skillu was pretty much irrelevant when the north came down, and they brought everyone. UALX was a full north vs south fight, basically the entire universe was involved, and the south won and won decisively.
---
If you are so new you don't know any of the history then your ignorance is understandable, but it doesn't change the history. Test has been hounded for actual years, and that has built and shaped the culture.
---
If you don't like it, then go back in time 6 years and ask PL to stop helicopter dicking everyone.
---
I like how this post aged.
---
Such is life with different timezones. Obvs not blaming anyone for setting it to their best time. Also TIL Fraternity had a NIP with AoM. I was not aware of that.
---
Ignore them. Do what you find fun. U have been farming level 4 missions for years, changing what ships I use and what fits I use for those missions is very fun to me. I then spend the ISK on PVP for more fun. Thing is, everyone on this subreddit will tell you that level 4 missions are a terrible grind and will make you quit the game. That's not the case with me, I enjoy it. Point is, ignore people like this and play how you want. It's a sandbox game for a reason.
---
Easier krabbing has made money less valuable. ISK doesn't have more buying power. It's that everything has gotten cheaper due to the ISK faucets.
---
Replace the word "Content" with "Handjobs".
---
Long story short, the tools/game settings needed to efficiently manage such an undertaking are unavailable without their (CCP's) involvement and are held together with duck tape and dried tears anyway.   
---
iirc, the tools used were made by a dev no longer even with CCP and CCP of course never saw fit to invest in something the players enjoyed so much. So, languished the code has.
---
  
---
Simple answer, Hilmar just don't give a fuck, is why.
---
It was a goodwill gesture when AOM moved to the server. Now it's back to them hating each other.
---
the "north" brought only pl, nc. if you wanna count jumping their supers at the end when goons were jumping theirs too. All those entities are not even close to be based on the north: skillu only was there because you decided to help xix survive(you know, the decade wide rmt drone farmers, but alas),  tri was only there because you actively helped xix evict them earlier and frat was there cause you were openly hostile and trying to kill them. And note, all of what i just mentioned was related only to UALX, a telegraphed as hell honeypot structure timer, actual entosis and sov job was done pmuch exclusively(if at all?) by pl.
---
You love to keep saying how you were hounded for years and years and that's why you guys have a culture of being such massive cowards, and that's understandable, but ask yourself: how did all other alliances survive along their lifespans without blueing everyone - or to quote vily: "shades of neutral" - ? 
---
and no the answer isn't "everyone did it"
---
Let's not generalise R/eve. It's not been salty to newer players asking for advise, it's the opposite. That's one damn thing that stands out above all the shit that goes and let's admit it, we all revel in it.

As one of the players approaching 15 years; EVE isn't like other games, with a few exceptions it won't mater that someone else has way more sp than you. That being said, the classic trope is that eve has a learning cliff not a learning curve. It's not an easy game to pick up, and there are a lot of people that play it that will enjoy ruining your day, but once you figure out what you like doing it is one of the most rewarding games you will ever play... right up until someone takes all your stuff...
---
Eve skills are somewhat time based (less so now than it used to be thanks to skill injectors) but they also have a diminishing return as you "learn" them to one area. Because of that, new players can very quickly compete with older players if they specialize. For example, if you focus on 1v1/small gang frigate pvp with in a few weeks your skill as a pilot will be a bigger factor than any sp discrepancy. My guns may do a few % more damage, but you can mitigate that by knowing what your doing. Also, most the older players generally don't even play eve anymore. It takes 3-4 hours minimum to do much of anything, and most of us are in our 30s now with kids/careers and don't have time to actually play...
---
There's a point where inviting more people over to help move a single couch... becomes pointless.

The Gist X-type **XL** shield booster is way over tanked. Get a Pith X-type **Large** shield booster (~~you could probably get away with a gist x-type large but its practically the same price as the pith, so get the pith~~ nm, pith x-type large is cheaper... get the pith, also get a 4th caldari bcs... dont cheap out on the last damage mod on a 2 bill ship)
---
That is an easy answer. They didn't. PL and NC. just roamed around fucking with people and evicted them at random. Goons even got evicted when PL rounded up everyone with dirty isk and we had the casino war.
---
Panfam had the only functional super fleet that could drop on people, so it would sit on top of its latest victim and brutalize them while poaching any super/titan pilot. This destroyed heaps of alliances and evicted many more.
---
The difference here is that test survived these repeated beatings and learned how to fight back.
---
I keep them on aggressive for PVP, never know if you're going to get jammed, they might as well shoot something even if you can't direct them.
---
what do you want to catch up to? i play for 5 years and can fly nearly everything with 4/5 out of 5 skills. and you can easily within 1 year be 4/5 on most of useful ships.

i thought the narrative was that they would just teleport across the game when you undocked anything, guess now they gotta sit on top of them.

yes hero was farmed, and if a shitty new player null coalition that could barely function being farmed is the reason for your current actions things are worse than i imagined.

so you're telling me that indeed it was a pl operation? i mean if you wanna just reiterate what i said you can just quote me.
---
&gt; NC deployed to 0SHIT to help thier pals
---
they didn't deploy supers, its irrelevant, something the start of your comment should've made clear already honestly. But sure lets add that maybe pl would get a few more subcaps from all 5 nc. players that actually logged in.
---
&gt; You also seem to have forgotten the C02 war and what sparked that (see C02 bluing Tri) and us removing them from Impass
---
oh i have not forgotten that, this one falls straight with your lovely infactuation with the long running drone rmt empire, but is hardly relevant to the point in question. I could go into how curious it is that defending co2 when they fucked up was the hill that got you fucked last time you tried and then decided to side with someone from outside this time but that's going off topic quite a bit.
---
&gt; skillu also moved their entire super fleet long before UALX and was staged in Immensea.
---
hmmmmmm i wonder why
---
Your whole reply jusk reeks of "oh look mom we actually beat ncpl" smug, which I guess is understandable when you make them out to be such a massive boogieman. But make no mistake, i couldn't care less about the ultra boomer withering in the old glory ncpl, this is not about them
---
and there it is
---
Sadly accurate. 
---
iirc, CCP Logibro was the hero who kept AT happening, but they let him go with the community team downsizing. Now the server used to host the games is fucked and nobody there wants to put in the effort to fix it.
---
I'm not sure what the fuck is going on at CCP, but they're doing a very effective job of disinvesting in the only successful title they have. It's like they hate money or something.
---
&gt;  i couldn't care less about the ultra boomer withering in the old glory ncpl, this is not about them
---
It will always be about them until this game dies. I'd wager to guess, Goons feel the same.
---
Edit: 
---
&gt;But sure lets add that maybe pl would get a few more subcaps from all 5 nc. players that actually logged in.
---
NC was fielding full fleets in Catch, what have you been smoking? Boosh Rokh's anyone? PL was embedded there. NC, PL, Tri had multiple Fortizars in Catch.
---
11 days old and 11 days of regret
---
Fuck I miss betting on matches and losing horribly.
---
You can catch up with certain specialties. For instance, you can be on the same level in a few weeks in flying droneboats, for instance. Players who have been playing longer have good skills in *more* areas of the game.
---
And you don't need to train anything to throw a warp disruptor on a frigate and hold things down while your fleetmates bag the prey. Shoot me a PM if you're up to starting.
---
Do what you want to do. The general rule is, the greater the danger you put yourself in, the greater the rewards. However, I'd suggest finding a player corporation as soon as possible. 11% tax rate sucks, mate. Feel free to PM me if you want to learn more.
---
For ISK, I'd suggest fitting up a Magnate or Heron for exploration. There's community fits available in game. If you want, you can Eve-Mail Shawn Kin'dred in game for more information.

It's a great game. Its one of the last "hardcore" MMO's on the market. I started several months ago myself and have been having a blast.
---
Don't worry about being super behind, there are "roles". 15 years playing the game and actively training won't make their characters skills better in one specific role compared to you in like a couple weeks, they are just skilled into more than one role.
---
It's pretty straightforward overall once you learn the vocabulary if you've ever played any other hardcore MMO, it's really nothing special. If my observations are accurate thus far, my only complaint would be that the majority of the "hardcore" null-sec playerbase is very very anti-hardcore game with their opinions, voices, and actions.
---
I would recommend joining a smaller corp as opposed to a big blob, you will learn more, quickly, and actually have an impact. Odds are, you will learn enough to be more than an F1 monkey, which beyond big ops, nobody wants to play with anyway.

1. There is no official goal. Do whatever you feel like doing.

2. Don't look at r/Eve until you've played for a few months. Most people here haven't played in years, haven't gotten over it, will complain about something and then when it gets changed, will complain about what it got changed to.
---
3. Join this corp:  [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying\_to\_EVE\_University](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying_to_EVE_University) 
---
4. If you don't join that corp, make ISK in faction warfare. If you do, run missions and Triglavian anomalies whenever anyone's looking for a salvager or something. That should be enough to get a new player started. Also try exploration. It can be feast or famine, but it can get you some good stuff.
---
5. The in-game markets all work as stock exchanges. Players put up market orders to buy or sell commodities. Then, someone else fills the order.

You should just join Wingspan and make your own torpedo deliveries!

The Alliance Tournament has always been on Tranquility, which is why it's exciting when high value ships explode. Logibro setup Thunderdome which he put a lot of his personal time into and was used for player run events (EVE_NT Championship, Anger Games, Theomachy).
---
Stay far away from r/Eve. People here like to complain far more than there is any need to complain.
---
It's worth starting. I started this year, I'm mostly caught up in terms of most of what I like to do (besides T2 ships). There's other stuff that I haven't checked out yet, such as capital ships, but I can fly the ships that I usually fly well enough.

---
Hard to say. Not only will you be far behind in time based skill learning, which I've always said is a useless mechanic in Eve specifically, you will also be behind in the politics.
---
I would say you're going to feel insignificant for a long time and without friends who play with you it'll be tough to have any fun or coordinate any activities. But if you click with the right Corp early on it might just work out.
---
There's no real objectives in Eve so people tend to all do their own thing and make it up as they go along. You would be lucky if either you can keep this up yourself or find others who let you in on theirs.

is it you noraus?
---
The hate amongs chineese factions is so real lol
---
As a relatively new player that quit a few weeks ago I would say try it, but don't feel force to commit to it.
---
The game, as you said is a very mature, it has a lot to offer in terms on variety of content in theory at least. The truth is, several of these aspects are locked behind the skill system or completely dominated by veterans. For example, marketing seems like a broad field to get into but at the end of the day you can't really compete with magnates (and bots) with billions of in game currency and thousands of market orders, on top of that you will need perfect skills just to start thinking of starting with it, which would take at least 1~2 months. 
---
Do you want to PvP? Many veterans here will tell you "skills don't matter" that's also what they told me. You are left basically with two options, fly inefficient equipped and skilled frigates spending all your resources into try to learn them but ultimately keep dying to veterans with perfect skills, better ships and better modules because there is no match making system or anything similar, or die to gankers and campers. The other option is to join a big alliance.. Be prepared to keep your ship on autofollow and press F1 (fire button) on command, because that's basically all you're going to do for a long time. Not to mention that specializing in ammo and specific types of ships requires several months of skill training.
---
At the end of the day, you can have fun playing this game to a certain degree and in certain areas most than others, unless you want to spend months and months of trivial and boring activities until you have the skills/experience to have a decent amount of fun or efficiency. 
---
I know this sounds pessimistic but I feel that many veterans forgot how the NPE feels like in this game, since they take for granted all the basics and even advanced skills and since they forgot what is like to start from scratch on a mature game. And I'm also aware that there are new players that stick to the game for a long time and don't mind the waiting or the inconveniences, but even CCP has confirmed on their livestreams that the game really struggles with new player retention.
---
Anyway, the game is free on the alpha clone state, no harm in trying it.
---
Exactly, everyone wants to plex their accounts for free, barely anyone wants to sell PLEX that they bought for hard cash. So who gives CCP money? Well, thats a good question isnt it.
---
I don't have much experience with invasions, but I'd check out the  [https://forums.warptome.net](https://forums.warptome.net/)  community, as well as just go to the invasion systems and ask for a fleet. Logi pilots are almost always needed.

THE SKY IS FALLING!!
---
That is the correct thing to say on r/eve right?
---
CAN SOMEBODY JUST TELL US WHO/WHAT TO BE OUTRAGED AT?
---
As someone who has started very recently I can assure you that you still can make isk and have a lot of fun with eve. Most things wont take too long to train and you can get into mining right off the bat. Aslong as you join a corp at first you should glide straight towards your goals. I joined pandemic horde and it's been treating me well so far. But yea go for it!
---
I don't own this man...he just works for me...every day...without pay...as well as his family..their friends and everyone else they know. They are not slaves though! They are free to wander around my estate, defending it and reinforcing the fences...
---
A simple PI app, you wouldn't be able to setup new buildings but you could start, stop or change item production and extraction as well as transfer to and from depot. 
---
Just think how many PI alts we could run while at work!

I was waiting to open a bar that we could decorate ourselves, I keep having to buy more giant cans for the corpses as you can only put 1000 in a can.
---
Que ? Cheap ships are fun. 
---
The n+1 meta means I take every advantage I can get. What else am I going to spend my isk on- this game is about ships

He will be missed dearly

Reading this reminded me of my brother he was the same never played but would watch me play for hours, he passed away 3 years ago RIP
---
Well we do have 80% of null as bluetral, so there isn't going to be any 'headlines' making wars. But there are always skirmishes and pvp action going on depending where on map you are. So plenty of pvp options still out there atleast for newer players to enjoy.

Why did Jita become the most popular trade hub? Did CCP intend this or did it happen organically?

See kids, it's easy to just pull bullshit accusations out of your ass without any evidence.

You know less about wspace politics than I do, and that's saying something
---
Fix ccp
---
If you can ignore the bittervets until you get the hang of it, go for it.  The new player experience is much more there than it was when I started
---
What is the minimum skills required to try an Abyssal Deadspace? Do you need t2 modules? I want to go in a Caracal, I have some missile skills, it‚Äôll mostly be T1 modules - I‚Äôm only looking to do the baseline easy ones to get going (Calm filaments?)
---
Current numbers? lol, nice try.
---
Fortunately someone took the time to [break down the math](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8y8ker/world_war_what_what_are_the_numbers/) while the war was happening.
---
WinterCo + Trumpy + Holy League + PanFam (minus NC., who stayed north) had roughly equal *total characters* to Legacy, which you'll see brought up by pro-WC/PanFam posters a lot. What they leave out is that WC+friends had a large advantage in active PVPers (5,540 vs. 3,930) and an even bigger advantage in supers (1,038 vs. 296) and titans (493 vs. 99).
---
We were outnumbered 4:1 in supercaps, resulting in our subcap fleets getting camped into citadels by titans and supers before UALX. Thus the basis of doomchinchilla's immortal smugpost, which we made him regret shortly thereafter.
---
o7 RIP
---
In space at the same time ?
---
The last bcs might add like 5-10 dps, not worth 100+ mil. I would even consider using a compact (even less dps) if he has fitting problems.
---
Ishtar
---
Could you link a fit somehow?
---
Paladins are stuck in bastion, easy to kill if scanned down (it will happen eventually).
---
Join faction war, you'll find very quickly that most things we fly don't require many skill points, flying cheap t1 frigates is actually a hell of fun, especially when you get a kill on an expensive ship.
---
My guys still roam in alpha fits some times for cheap throw away ships.
---
Would take you a couple of months to get everything you need for fw to level 5 and then you can branch out into large ships for some crazy fleets on occasion.
---
Delayed local
---
or 
---
sovereignty structure shows players on local chat list after being in system for 1 minute.
---
I know at least 3 people with between 10 and 30 characters, and I barely interact with people. I've had the talk about people with hundreds of characters and I have no reason to think they were lying. There have also been forum threads with people reporting having dozens and hundreds of characters. Since it's a profitable enterprise I don't see why not.
---
&gt; Do you know how much time it needs to manage those? 
---
Barely any time, it takes under a minute to extract each character. On large scale, this may be extremely autistic and cause some people to hate life, but not impossibly long.
---
&gt; Do you know what's the profit per month? You know it's negative? 
---
Do **you** know what's the profit per month? Do you realize it's actually positive with the current prices? Have you actually tried doing the math, or are you just pulling random numbers out of your head?
---
&gt; Lol, Rorqual mining is more profitable. 
---
It's not more profitable if you consider profit per amount of time spent in the game. That is, of course, irrelevant if you start botting, but in that case you can also automate skill farms.
---
The fact that people still post my senate hearing propaganda brings tears to my eyes. ( #proud)
---
Dude stop talking shit. I was in the fleet, I literally know where they were and they literally knew where we were since we were looking at eachother. They had more subs, caps and supers than us but they never engaged and let us reff half of detorid.
---
And if youre thinking about the KS timer. I mean it would be suicide to even try. Ofc we wouldnt engage over that.
---
so i can declare war on other corps
---
There are none that offer the same value, your either ironically shipping into bigger ships like the myrm or dominix that cost more earn less and cant run all the sites, or your up scaling your investment into a gila or some other faction cruiser costing more isk.
---
Nerfing the vin was a mistake I get their intentions but it removed the best ship from new bros needing to make isk for ships and skills and didn't give them a good replacement. 
---
Some will argue with me on that tho.
---
The ones from Test were hilarious.
---
Yup. Lots of conflict if you want it.
---
only need one to declare war on other corps
---
Sure.
---
Can only pilot one at a time though.
---
You can only declare war on corps with structures.
---
apparently not noraus just an random line member you can even search his name in the game, AOM leadship involved in the biggest RMT behaviour in serenity and even quit their day job for it, and most of their line member rely on RMT for their real life. They earned millions of RMB from the game which dirrctly ruined game itself. So the hates is come from there
---
No.
---
Shit.  I just stumbled on to the fact that local is back.  Been weeks since I've thought about logging on.
---
My goal is to kill people with my blops. Just finished to train the skills, now I need to make money. I was thinking of stealing people money with ess ( made 900 M in a day without playing more than 2 hours last time)
---
I talked to him a lot. Amrast is edgy, but that's all. I would totally hang out with with him irl, if he didn't live on the other side of the planet
---
No, you are wrong. When I was new, some people tell me to use a vni. This is the worst thing I ever made in eve. That was boring, and at the and of the day, I lost money.
---
But I hate living in null, so my point of view isn‚Äôt objective
---
Well, thats one way to do it lol, hf!
---
The hard part of eve is the skill train time, its quick to get up to speed for one career but takes an age to get multi skilled pilot that can do everything.             
---
            
---
I would recommend you start by getting a buddy invite from anyone so you get a 1m sp boost then start 3 more accounts via the same process sending the invite to yourself from your main.             
---
           
---
Train 1 into pvp/ratting 1 into mining 1 into explo and the forth towards capitals.              
---
              
---
Keep them alpha and train to the 5m sp limit focussing training for each on its intended use. Try the various aspects of the game using the relevant account and if you feel you want to sub one go for it.             
---
You don‚Äôt need to sub anything you don‚Äôt want to and your main will probably be the one skilled into the thing you enjoy most
---
i'm not even sure tbh
---
Price for value!? Praxis.
---
Ha! You believe that? My cat Kerfluffle tells me word is on the street Legacy is going to blue Dying Co and pincer us!
---
Yet your still replying üòÇ
---
Less idiots posting bad suggestions = win
---
We need more positive stuff so as to not scare off potential players
---
Insert comment about correlation v causation
---
Bait is bait
---
Closest direct analogue is probably the myrm. Gila is a very good ratting ship too. Ishtar is also good but it's T2 (so high skill) and as expensive as a gila.
---
Spend more that 12 minutes in omist or period basis. Theres your evidence
---
Eve does not have high learning curve, it has a high time sink. Hopefully activities in between your wait times are sustainable to keep you going until you establish yourself more firmly in the game.
---
yeah there are structures in highsec.
---
Thats why villy is sucking miattanis dick so hard.
---
RMT and BOT never break the law in any country, but will ruin your loved game.  so what's your point?  good English writer?
---
Lol  I love you blame CCP for you blue'ing everything close to you.  Does the mechanic suck?  Yes, but it goes hand and hand with Test wanting to be a victim so they got to blame someone.
---
if you had one
---
Ask the Head of Development...
---
before the blackout my goal was to be able to build one capital ship every day (dread, carrier or fax). I abandoned that goal when blackout started. I made isk with one rorqual and 3 vnis. I stopped that too when blackout started. Also my pi which made me around 3.5 b every month i stopped doing. Right now i don't make any isk. I started playing again as an alpha. I try to do some damage in highsec by declaring war on corps and remove structures. I spend all the isk i made in nullsec before the blackout. I started with 13b liquid isk. Now i am at around 9b. If i run out i maybe buy a plex to get some isk. I don't really wanna grind for isk anymore. It's just boring and takes too much time.
---
Based on hearsay from people who went to G-fleet, Falcon was certain it'd be coming back but Fozzie was saying that it's dead and gone for good. I wouldn't hold my breath for its return personally.
---
u/WTB_Killmarks is running a very bling marshal ^(btw)
---
Fight each other.
---
Why is someone asking for more information on the topic getting downvoted, fucking tapi retards
---
If you want to do endless structure bash ops and only hyperdunk or blueballs with no real fight ever happening then yes, go join nullsec.
---
XIX hold record for longest entos war in EVE,for around 9 months before war in south started,and even then XIX was 1st in this war with WC just after short break settling in tenerifis ,46dp was unpenetrable but XIX is on verge of collapse :P,list goes on and on ...
---
If you have more fun now than before, this is good for you I think. Farming is boring
---
so, you are fine with donating them for free? 
---
or do you really expect FRT got money left?
---
you know its not gonna happen right?
---
Myrm is kind of shit compared to the VNI of old tho. VNI rating was never exactly making any (real) player rich, and the Myrm experiments I've conducted have barely yielded half of that.
---
My advice would be to go for a more active BS alternative. Long range missile boats are a good start (Raven or Typhoon) as they can do good damage at ranges where tank is not an issue. And then work your way into a Rattlesnake.
---
If you like to multibox, I've found groups of sentry Dominix to be very effective as well. I sometimes run 4 of those myself, and can rival carrier levels of income. Takes some practice to manage efficiently tho.
---
good luck :)
---
To be fair, this is also where CCP seem to be getting their ideas from these days.
---
Why would we care? We live in space. The sky is quite literally beneath us.
---
Started around 2 years ago, feel pretty happy about it. Do not feel like an ant :D
---
It's still possible to rat in a vni. 4 medium +1 large drone. If you sacrifice a bit of tank/drone damage you can fit 3 medium hybrid guns and fly a little closer, it does take a bit longer.
---
It's also possible to alpha vni but I'd stick to the lower sites as you need to give up a lot of tank + drone damage in order to keep cap stable with the 100mn ab
---
Would say the same
---
Can you not just assign them all to one domi with a gun/tp?
---
&gt;the amount of work they do is great and it feels so nice to have a talented ally that is willing to put in that sort of work.
---
What a fucking joke, these guys are good, let's blue them. The Nullsec spod has gone to your brain man

It depends on what you want/expect from the game.
---
Almost like I was there too in the actual fleet, and you're so full of shit it's pouring our of your eyes as well as your mouth.
---
The *CTA* operation to move in to rage, was 2 full fleets and a followup of aprox 100 or so. That was the "max max max EVERYBODY" number: about 650 or so. At no point did numbers reach that again, as you'd expect because that "650" was a lot of alts, haulers, scouts, etc.
---
Typically the standing fleet for hole control in EU prime was around the 60-80 mark.  Obviously, 60-80 nullbab spodbrain F1-monkeys is an unreasonable hill to ask 3 orphans and a crippled nun (FC) to climb.  Maybe HK should have recruited a couple of 3-legged kittens as well.
---
And once you start going into 5/5ing skills, you catch up on a lot of ships at once!
---
He is aware of my Marshal activities. We met but thanks to a Sin buddy I lived to tell the tale but barely by the skin of my teeth.
---
But...no.
---
My original goal in beta was to become a high ranking, well known, and feared pilot within New Eden.
---
Then I took a break for 15 yrs.
---
My new goal is to progress through all aspects of gameplay whilst gradually increasing my impact on the history of Eve.
---
For now my goal is just to buy anything shiny that I want to complement my machariel, I loved hull shape and how it perform but why does it mix shield &amp; armor tanked, sometimes its hard to fit it but I think I got good shield tanked now because I filled low with gyro..  
---
Just waiting for my shipment with pushx to sell in market to buy another set of fittings...  
---
I just love flying around in machariel shooting rats or roaming triglavian...
---
I have no goal. I just like to tell other gamers that I play EVE, while looking down on them with superiority, as the inferior peasants that they are.
---
Did Mitani tell you that?
---
Ye that was a strange thing. You guys have been all in as far as I can see, no salt or nothing.
---
Sounds awesome!
---
I mean... I'd be down.
---
Exciting :D
---
We were the only ones that came South after the Casino War. Now we are playing the stupidly long game. Gimme  dat Delve honey!
---
I struggled to decide on a goal early on. But after a year I decided to create my own Corp and front that my goal was to grow my Corp and move to Null Sec or WH space. We achieved both of those goals, maybe too soon, but had a lot of inactive members too so had a purge and looking to rebuild with some fresh faces.
---
Going forward, the goal is to move back to WH or NS space. But with a bigger, stronger and more active Corp this time round.
---
yes you can place a structure as an alpha and you can war on another corp as an alpha.
---
Test only got evicted fucking once, and that was by goons (the cfc). Stop rewriting history to fit in with your victim complex.
---
I do fly an abaddon to hunt and travel around and will name it "That Spaceship" for him, may he continue flying dangerous on the otherside.
---
It certainly is. I‚Äôve made plenty of mistakes and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll make plenty more. But being CEO of a Corp has given me more of a reason to log in, even on those days when I actually can‚Äôt be bothered to log in, I know I need to. To recruit, or sort contracts, or give advice to new players etc etc.
---
Also cool with that. We need a local shakeup, and it might even take a few different experiments to find the balance.
---
:(
---
To kill people without relying on anyone else, and to annoy everyone as much as possible in general. Though I just +5‚Äôd an alliance for the first time, so I might be on a downward slope...
---
Honestly the only real salt i hear is when people talk of the war possibly ending because it is a fucking solid source of content, FRT have kept up solid defence, good fights, good kills, not too easy, not too hard, just look at days like today, SOOOO MUCH FUN FIGHTING.
---
o7 Will you be putting his name up with the new monument that they are launching for passed players?
---
The ways killing in eve works limit your advantage to level 5. To illustrate, a 10 yr eve veteran can only train Minmatar Frigate to Level 5 and Other relevant skills for small ships to Level 5. Generally these skills take very short time to train. To be fully proficient (in-game skill wise) for small ships generally take less than 1 month. Hence theoretically from in game skills perspective, a month new bro can beat a 10 yr veteran in same ship. 
---
However naturally a PvP vet will have other skills that he/she can use that unrelated to in game skills, e.g., knowledge on falloff, tracking, interaction with rats etc.. a vet can use this skills to win a 1v1 pvp with new bro. However this is no different with other game.
---
IMHO, because the effect of max levelling in eve (cap at level 5), eve can be quite accessible for newbro.
---
o7 old man. I hope you enjoy it out there among the stars.
---
So my point is valid then.. all these pro hunters bitching cos they cant kill harmless miners or eaters, maybe they should try hunting other hunters
---
I want to build carriers, but it's a long process especially when you don't have amazing mining skills.
---
I'd rather move back north tbh. I miss the vale
---
Dying. Since 2013.
---
Mine is similar, not blops specifically, but bringing back solo battleship roaming into my como. Solo confessors and stuff is nice but there's nothing like battleship roaming. 
---
Best of luck with yours man.
---
&gt; How to REALLY win Eve  
---
&gt; Don't go to the toxic cesspool that is r/eve.
---
I think that what you just described is how to really win /r/Eve , not Eve.
---
The goal: collect as much salt you can from others, and give them as less as you can.
---
sure. just don't only grind isk. Find something fun with interaction with other players. Otherwise you will get bore at some point.
---
This is the right way man!
---
I was running dual sentry Domis in Havens and matching what I could get in my carrier. That said, I don't think I ever got the knack of fighter control, so probably wasn't making as much as some of the autists around me.
---
Then go and find another game where you can find your content. Maybe Tetris?
---
I think historically the DRF are the biggest botters in eve history, going back to before alphas made botting way more wide spread.

---
My goal is to be able to do whatever I want. I don't really bother with isk or pve that much, I made about 7-8bil in a week recently and that will last me a long time. With that I've bought a fax and a carrier and started shipping parts to build doctrine ships for myself to use and some to sell on contract. 
---
I don't really have any big ambitions, I've done the whole maniacal overlord thing before in another game and as much as I enjoyed pretty much ruling a whole universe and the floods of tears it was a lot of effort.
---
I started as a miner in providence and found a really good group to play with. I learnt the game basics. Got accused of being a spy because I read  EVERYTHING on the wiki. Love lore and pve, and not really in to pvp. Hopped corps for two years trying to try everything in the game. Spent a lot of time in wormhole space. Managed a wormhole corp for a little bit. Lived through multiple alliance/group deaths and kept going. My goal was to join a null group and play with carriers.¬£35 later and I am now playing with carriers lol (plex). Finally able to afford pvp ships consistently so can try stuff. Now my goal is to save for a super and titan and just have fun. Just want to learn pvp in general now.
---
Not become a blue donut
---
Well, yes.
---
I really enjoy playing EVE right now, even without the blackout, but everytime I visit r/eve I get some undescribable emotion that makes me wanna close reddit and go have fun instead.
---
Would you mind explain what is ess ?
---
I'd really suggest not. The developers had decided to open the game up somewhat to new players &amp; entity but have instead yielded to bitter Vets and closed the black out down.
---
The game direction is clear, maintain established player base &amp; entities while catering for their whims &amp; wants. There is no real desire for game change or new blood. I'd seriously look elsewhere but having said that the current MMO market is bleak and if you want perma death &amp; perma asset destruction combined with real economy.
---
Sorry for your loss.
---
All the talent went to Riot games...
---
Now isn‚Äôt LOL a sinking ship?
---
Keep in mind you can repurchase the Galaxy Packs and DLC on Steam after you've purchased them on the EVE store
---
Don't look at zkill, don't visit r/Eve, don't listen to idiots who complain constantly. Winrar!
---
Good fight. The hyperion is a funny ship. I wish more boats had active tank bonuses.
---
The ess , for encounter surveillance system, is a deployable, like mtu or mobile depot. You can can only place it in nullsec. What he do is taking 20% of all the bounties in the system, and place it in a pool. If the pool is big enough, he will augment the isk he place in the pool ( if he take 10 isk he will place maybe 11 ). Then , you can acess to hit, and have 2 options: give back the bounties to they owner, + a bonus in lp + the additional isk created, or you can take all the isk of the pool.
---
My plan is to place it in system with not very attentive people, and take the 20 %
---
Also sorry for bad English, not my language
---
Accomplished everything I wanted to when I started in 2011 (namely, own a super cattier). Owned a Hel for a bit which I actually hated since it‚Äôs like a coffin for the toon (and I only have 5). 
---
Now for the first time ever I‚Äôm taking a slightly more active role in leadership my Corp. I‚Äôve played for a while and I‚Äôm probably ‚Äòdecent‚Äô at the game but I‚Äôve never been that go-to content creator, more of just a pilot who knows his way around a triple boxed scanner, Sabre, and nano-cruiser which is the fairly common default expectation in WHs. 
---
Now I‚Äôm trying to be a go getter for content in a leadership kind of way. Working-ish so far but I always feel the need to catch a bigger target or start a bigger fight to get more logins, and I‚Äôll always be limited by a full time job that eats up 60 hours of my week every week. 
---
My end-goal is to be the one that finds that one spectacular fight against a null-bloc with my alliance in 100mn cruisers vs the whole world. I‚Äôve been in select few engagements like this before and it‚Äôs the definition of fun for me in eve, winning against 5-1 odds, etc.
---
The Cynabal. I identify as a Cynabal. I fly it all the time, I hope one day I will become the poster boy for the cynabal. I have set myself up a C5 farmhole for the sole purpose of funding Cynabals. I'm currently going through the legal process of changing my name to Cynabal, I've also talked to a doctor about starting hormone treatment to transition to a Cynabal. 
---
Cynabal is love, Cynabal is life.
---
You're "safe" outside of sites in a wh. Just make sure you bookmark your exit (rule #1-#3). All gas sites have NPCs after 15 mim timer. Data and relic level 1s and 2s have no NPC spawns (can chill). There are level 3s with no npc spawns, these are "faction named", aka they have "sanshas/guristas/angels/blood raider" in their title.
---
I don't really visit r/eve to increase my drive to play , I visit it to make myself feel normal human being (comparatively).
---
Running abyssals this morning. not a SINGLE building material drop. no zero point or condensate...did they change something????
---
Falcon didnt quite say that. What he did say is that they would know Q4 2019 if they would do it or not.
---
I visit it to see the tendies being flung back and forth between the ‚Äú meta warriors‚Äù.
---
Can I have his stuff?
---
I wonder if anyone solo's the conduits in a carrier?
---
Shocker!
---
look really nice

Can you share your build?
---
I like to troll people and mess with them. It's fun.
---
My goal was to become the all time pilot with a ship. And I did it in my beloved Endurance. A killing machine. Maybe next one is the Venture.
---
You don't have to mine in order to build though
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

When rorqual yields were even more broken and I had more time on my hands, I set a goal to build two titans with bridges + two accounts that could fly them so I could bridge myself around nullsec.

For Test, it started after PL ran from the Honeybadger Coalition. For Brave, it started in Catch 1.0 when Lychton refused to dance to Elise and Grath's deranged ways how Brave apparently should play the game. 
---
Let's not pretend there was no Fountain, Querious, DOG-HQ, and for Test, at least Wicked Creek and the Vale (which technically doesn't count as an eviction but it was going to be). And that's just the two that survived your crap, countless smaller groups were superdicked out of the game. 
---
It all added up to UALX where PL, SkillU, Tri., Frat., several German and French Frat. renters, PH, NC. etc. finally burned their asses as the new united south saw what was coming, again. Why would we not stay together, and enjoy you sitting on your blisters, mumbling about the old days from your allowed retirement home in Malpais?
---
Get out of here with facts! We're doing a good bud tug about grr TEST from all the people that don't even play Eve anymore!
---
Vily is already doing it. They're late to the party.
---
&gt; My main concern is that I'll be super behind. 
---
Its ok, I joined in 2013 and I am wicked behind; and yet, not behind at all. Let me tell you the true secret to eve, ready? Eve is about working together.
---
Eve has a massive skill tree, you will always be behind in skills compared to someone else, but skills, only matter so much. Even the character with the best skills can only do so much. Each skill only goes up to V.
---
Eve may have one of the largest "crafting trees" in the MMO game world. It requires a very diverse set of skills, and inputs. Inputs come from ores, planetary resources (a factory mini-game sort of), and even shooting NPCs. As soon as we get to anything more complicated than a T1 gun or ship hull, we are even using inputs that need to be produced.
---
The upshot of it is, for anything even moderately complicated and really worthwhile, most of what we might call "finished goods" require multiple characters to create... ideally, this means multiple people working together. It is a real economy....an explosion based economy.
---
You know what benefits an economy? More people participating in it.
---
Note, I haven't even mentioned PVP. This is, quite simply, because ships are tools and its really more about how you use them, its all extremely situational and a lot more about player skills. Neither price of the ship nor character skills really are what win fights, not unless everything else was equal...and it so seldom is.
---
In reality, there are useful fleet roles you can play on day 1 and from there its just a matter of what you want to do. Lots of fun stuff is within a few hours/days of training. Yet, after a few years, there is still more.
---
But remember what I said...its an explosion based economy. Blowing up ships is inventory control. Blowing up ships supports industry.
---
Eyes forward, capsuleer. The cyno is now lit.
---
Quit, and you finally won. This is the only known way.
---
I would really appreciate a build about this too!
---
How is that proof of TEST rmt?
---
The only problem with not going here is that CCP clearly does listen to those who yell the loudest on r/eve.
---
Tirglavian survey "databases" aren't used.  They can be sold to NPC buy orders at full price (100,000 isk each), so they're like Sleeper blue loot in that they're guaranteed profit.  Their "studied" by the NPCs in the game, but you don't actually use them for anything other than selling for pure profit.
---
Don't need to imagine when TAPI members remind us almost everyday about how PL wronged them 4? years ago in a conflict that TAPI inserted itself in. And also remind us how PL is ded, and 4 years ago, it was how Goons wronged them 2-3 years earlier.
---

---

My ony regret: not having started years earlier.
---
In the beginning you will have a much thougher learning process than in any other games. Not by "which skills or not should i train" but by game mechanics.
---
Learn that EVE Uniwiki is your best friend about everything.   
---
Many information are up to date and you get pointer for lots of things.
---
Yeah that's what I hate lol!
---
[`]
---
Noble point, sir.
---
All groups use a variety of both shield and armor tank. It depends on the doctrine. The biggest issue I see is that you will have to train into Link skills. Which takes a really really long time. It‚Äôs worth it no doubt, but they are very long trains. As for PvE, marauders are fine I guess. I never really did HS PvE aside from incursions.
---
You choose the ship with the bonus' that help your fleet setup. Info bursts are always good, shield and armor and based on fleet.
---
That was my goal until I reached the point I can now do it, then I quit the game cause after years of my supers gathering dust it seems like it may never happen again.
---
Underrated
---
nearly every group has armor AND shield doctrines. dont listen to whoever told you that.
---
most used commandships are damnation(armor) and claymore/vulture (shield)
---
sometimes the eos gets used for skirm boosts in an armor fleet. but since the eos is somewhat squishy you usually just slap skirm links on a damnation that has way more tank.
---
and if you werent aware, t3c have a subsystem for boosts too. so if you mainly want to fly boosts, commandships arent the only option. some doctrines especially cruiser ones often fly with t3c boosts because the commandships are to slow for them.
---
if you are going the boost-route. just dont forget to basically max out all the skills for them. dont just stop as soon as you can fit the t2 module.
---
I have literally tried to play eve 15 times over the past 5 years.. i just get so overwhelmed by everything..

Noticed it myself. Every time I've undocked this month I've had fun. Every time I've come to this sub, I've started thinking about quitting &amp; what I'll do with my life when Eve dies.

All in all, I prefer undocking.

Nice vid, great battle and management of multi account. I especially enjoyed the mid fight cap charges delivery!
---
It really was the only way it was interesting. Eve is one of the worst games to watch someone play. At least AT had commentary and every now and then an OK camera angle but watching someone stream Eve in general is just awful.
---
They got yelled at for that. They were gonna hold the last guy and loot the field. Since all the matches happen at the same place there's lots of loot strewn about but the tourny guys told them if they keep wasting time they'd be disqualified lol

My endgoal in this game is to get revenge by evicting a specific large group of players who destroyed my home with pretense of "gud fites" while outnumbering us 3:1 in each engagement.
---
then I'll probably just biomass
---
Yeah the lack of originality fucking blows me away with this one. There's room for space explo games on the market, and CCP isn't perfect, but this is... Oof.. it's all just as much poorly translated shit as they could ripoff from Eve before launch, and my guess is they were intentionally cutting corners and ripping things off to save time and beat Eve:echoes to market.
---
lol, was holding my breath by the time the vedmak went down xD cheers!
---
The important part is that you've found a way to try and feel smugly superior. It'll last until familiarity with your new situation breeds the same contempt, and you'll have to migrate to yet another one for a new shot of pretending really hard to be above the rest.
---
The only way to really win EVE is to buy CCP and shut it down.

So then you do have some sort of dirty fetish for what are basically imaginary characters in a video game with a small player base? The amount of fetishising of people in Eve Online is super weird and this sub is waaaay to into it. r/confusedboners

Seconded. Thanks to all the involved parties.

---
Genuinely I don't think the game is worth diving into anymore for new players, specifically because of the overall stagnation the game has been experiencing. There is plenty of discussion about the problems we've created for ourselves on the subreddit so it's not really worth diving too deeply here.
---
That said if you end up playing semi seriously here is some feedback.
---
1. Don't join a mega group; specifically stay the fuck away from Test, Horde and Goons and their allies.  When you are being recruited by some corp (space guild), ask if they are allied to any of those people, if the answer is yes tell them that you'd rather suck on sweaty socks and that Meiqur told you to say that.
---
2. Find a close nit set of friends you can spend time with ON COMMS.  If you cannot play on comms, you are missing 85-90% of the game.  Eve is entirely social, and very very little of it happens in the actual game client itself.  Almost everything fun you will experience happens in relationship to the adventures you have with people.
---
3. Get ready for a LOT of learning, eve has the highest (by orders of magnitude) learning curve of any game on the market.  The minutiae of subjects ranging from combat to industry to trade to spying (etc etc) are vast, not one single veteran of the game has mastery of everything.  In fact, far more important than ingame skills and barriers, are the knowledge barriers that you won't even know you have infront of you. Be prepared for severe and suddenly painful (expensive) lessons as you stumble around for the first several years of playing.
---
4. Relax, it's completely pretend.  People, because of how much time and sometimes IRL money they've dumped into the game take it very seriously.  It's ok to take it seriously, it's also ok to not worry and let stuff happen, if you find yourself getting "too" invested, don't panic, relax and get yourself some hot pockets.
---
5. CCP despite being a harsh mistress is on your side and wants you to succeed. Don't bite the hand that feeds you.
---
6. If you are still reading this and think this is for you, welcome aboard we need you.
---
When good points are made on both sides a compromise that fits to serve those points is.
---
You'd enjoy this tho. /r/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM
---
After 9hrs of straight toasting and watching frat feed fleet after fleet, I kept thinking to myself so this must be why fraternity never underdocks.  Burning Deteroid is soo much fun. And for all the haters who will say goons and AOM helped, well they did help but  Legacy was still outnumbered and they still couldn't stop us. Maybe it's time to take up a new gameWind spirots, Noraus and ELO? Maybe WOW is more your speed of game.
---
It's gonna be a great week.
---
Bug?
---
Well your facts are wrong.
---
Paladin and all the Marauder's were around before the bastion module.
---
This is why stagnation, cap proliferation and blue donuts are so bad for the game. I'm sure you aren't alone in this either. I'm guessing plenty of people left due to this. My advice to you is get out and learn to fly other stuff. Frig-cruiser pvp is fun if you get good at it. Then you don't have to wait for cap brawls, you can head out and find pvp virtually any time of any day.
---
They orbit at like 6.5km except for the cruiser which you can pulse MWD twice and web down towards the end. Dual web a trig, blasters kill it in 2 volley normally, rinse repeat. Done about 50 or so of these so far with this build, got into structure once or twice. Bookmark a wreck, warp to structure, rep, salvage with a noctis.   
---
Isk isn't great but maybe the salvage spikes when more t2 trig ships and items come out.

---
The thing about Eve is that even if you find a certain playstyle that is fun, CCP will make a boneheaded change in the future and destroy that fun. I would probably pass.
---
Hats off to them for working sundays. :)
---
already? Dam i have been waiting the last 3 days for them to turn of the dual authenticator crap.
---
Absolutely agree with the sentiment here. I think that until the developer knows what type of game they want to run, it's very risky to invest any time whatsoever into EVE. Especially as a new player.
---
This is the right answer, but I don't think it works any more. They turned it off in the invasion patch iirc.
---
&gt; For Test, it started after PL ran from the Honeybadger Coalition.
---
You realise you're talking about an event that happened in a computer game almost 8 years ago right?
---
&gt; For Brave, it started in Catch 1.0 when Lychton refused to dance to Elise and Grath's deranged ways how Brave apparently should play the game.
---
I promise you as someone who spoke to the guy as a diplomat on a few occasions they only thing deranged was Lychton's view of the game. That guy had absolutely no idea how the game worked mechanically, socially or politically.
---
&gt; It all added up to UALX where PL, SkillU, Tri., Frat., several German and French Frat. renters, PH, NC. etc. finally burned their asses as the new united south saw what was coming, again.
---
Imagine actually believing UALX which wasn't even the biggest supercap brawl that year was the culmination of a decade long plan to defeat PL.
---
The problem is you're sitting around talking about things that happened literally years ago _in a computer game_. Like you're not entirely wrong, but I just think you need to seriously address what you're doing with your life and your time if you have the energy to sit around worrying about that instead of just taking the game for what it is and trying to have as much fun as possible.
---
1: whatever you wish as it is a sandbox.
---
2: there are a *lot* of ways. Ideally, look at what you enjoy doing and find something tied to it. Ratting, PvE missions, incursions, exploration, trading, industry etc. are all viable, but you need it to be something that's along the way of what you enjoy doing or the thing you enjoy doing, else you'll just grind and not enjoy the game.
---
3: stock market isn't really a thing. The main economy is just that of goods (the market). Everything in eve past the very basic resources is manufactured by players. It takes a player to mine ore, refine it, move it to a build site, manufacture, then move it to a location fo selling and sell it. Each of these steps can be different players. It then gets more complicated when looking at T2 items and similar. The TL;DR is that everything takes another player time and effort, and there is no teleporting goods around the universe like your typical MMORPG's auction house.
---
Same here. Hope you get some good fights ;)
---
Neat stuff.
---
your facts are wrong but yes maurders need a small nudge back into thier role ( since their bonuses to the tractoring/salvaging aspect is grossly overshadowed by  the noctics and MTU's ) It could be something simple like being able to also use a set of 5  salvage drones with a bonus in addition to normal drones and give the salvaging chance a higher rate
---
I had to refuel stront twice, usually toasters never live long enough to have to be refueled. Oh well thanks for all the killmarks Elo
---
You weren't around for Impass, were you?
---
TEST kicks botters as soon as we find them.
---
Myrm is about 25% less per tick, but cheaper and insures great. Good for AFK multiboxing.
---
If you're going to be paying attention, the ishtar is your best bet for ticks equivalent to  the old VNI. But because it takes you like 6-8 hours to recoup that investment as opposed to 2 in a myrm, you can't really afford to afk in them.
---
And if you're actively at your computer playing EVE, then for the love of god do something that isn't subcap anom ratting.
---
Missions are/were laid out with the POS code as well.
---
There‚Äôs a lot of strong pvp fits that are based on missiles. Rockets and rapid lights are particularly popular. Along with torpedos in null sec.
---
that be some thug shit g
---
&gt;The micro doomsday cannon
---
&gt;They are the weakest of the races as far as dps
---
And they are the strongest of the ships in all other aspects: Weapon application, tank, mobility (MJD is a bit situational though), utility (4 utility high slots!).
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt feel that this is an unreasonable request, there is sound logic behind it
---
I feel this is completely unreasonable requrest with no logic behind it. Just saying that the marauder should deal in single ship alphaing hit same dps as the highest dps ship that requires spoolup is just wrong.
---
&gt;By this I mean, It would be better if the drive had a dialable range one that could be set by the pilot, this would allow for micro jumping to any range the pilot desires. And would way more useful than just a set 100k range. 
---
Learn to do triangular micro jumps. One jump to jump away and second jump to land on top of the target.
---

Bumping is perfectly fine here. If you collide by your own mistake you are just being bad.

I pvp a lot I go through 5-10 ships a week. Sometimes I lose that many in a day. I buy t1 frigates 30 at a time and most destroyer and below in 5-6 ships batch. Bigger I buy in 1s and 2s because it‚Äôs pricey and a pain to haul.

---
Good luck in your endeavors
---
Correlation =/= causation.
---
Wide brush strokes. The people who stick around "kinda" have their shit together when it comes to making ISK in game therefore they are natural buyers of PLEX. Those who come into a game and want to try everything and hence in "catch up" mode are more natural PLEX sellers into the market.
---
Therefore to me those that are left are buying the same amount of PLEX on market from less sellers. Therefore the price goes up.
---
Oh for fucks sake, its one word and you messed it up

Right? It's kind of weird. If you wanna smooch dudes that's totally cool, I support you. But there's so many people that get way too worked up about someone who plays a role in pretend time spaceship game it really doesn't seem healthy.
---
There's nothing healthy about eve tbh. You either play too casually to do anything of note, or you tryhard until you complete social and professional suicide.
---
&gt; The problem is you're sitting around talking about things that happened literally years ago in a computer game. Like you're not entirely wrong...
---
Amazing isn't it, what a game we play. But I am glad we have established this. 
---
&gt; Imagine actually believing UALX which wasn't even the biggest supercap brawl that year was the culmination of a decade long plan to defeat PL.
---
A plan? Ok. Still worked out though. 
---
&gt; ... but I just think you need to seriously address what you're doing with your life and your time if you have the energy to sit around worrying about that instead of just taking the game for what it is and trying to have as much fun as possible.

I'm doing pretty good lately actually. Alas I don't play much Eve anymore, this was just morning coffee as I still very much enjoy r/eve.

Mods on this sub are toxic morons

Awww you're cute.
---
Do you understand the difference between "initially" and "typically", or, come to that the distinction between "CTA fleet" and "standing fleet"?
---
I ask because it seems that - by your own account - you're kind of fuzzy on why "1000" and "400" aren't the same thing.
---
If not, then there's not much you're going to gain from this until you do.

Thanks I'm in a Corp at the moment and decided to buy a destroyer but didn't realise you need the skill training
---
You can get full 2mil sp/month with +5 implants and a proper remap, for 4 extractors per character. That gives a few billion isk per dedicated account.

If you have more than one character you're obviously going to use corp hangar for shared inventory.

Most destroyers don't have exploration skill bonuses, however the Society of Conscious Thought shiplines do have a destroyer called the [Sunesis](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Sunesis) that has bonuses for exploration. You don't need to train into any specific race for these ships either.
---
When looking for the [Sunesis](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Sunesis) on the marketplace looking for the dropdown called "special edition destroyers" in ships. You should be able to find them there. Happy flying!

I'm getting one for the missions where you have to take out enemy's in the area
---
You just need a beam algos.
---
Yes thank you for correcting me
---
Oh I see. It should do you well if you get one. It's quite flexible fitting wise so you can use whatever weapons you please on it, which also lends itself to maybe being a bit confusing for how you should build it. The biggest trouble you'll have I think is tanking. Try to use speed and range with destroyers, and becareful of having your microwarpdrive turned on all the time(it makes you easier to hit).

What good would a destroyer be?
---
Do they get scan or hack bonuses?

Of not, then only jackdaw is worthwhile really.

For relic/data exploration there's no reason to use anything except an exploration frigate, and then Astero or covops as you skill up and become able to cloak.

I was going to us it for the explore missions where you destroy a enemy
---
imagine being this stupid
---
Thats a big one

Neither, you put in some Trig database things, think 50 or 500, I forget. Put them in the cache, get npc lore back...basically trig Facebook posts.

Ive played on and off since 2006. I've done most everything, from highsec missions and mining to suicide ganking, from nullsec blobs and rorq mining to wolfpack PvP and multiboxing 5-6 machs smartbomb ratting, from market trading and little PI empires to WH and LS living.
---
Earlier this year I was fed up with null and not excited about any other prospects. I ended up selling my titan, super, caps, and everything else, and extracting all 8 of my characters. I was 50/50 on killing my 500b worth of injectors with an alt until they didn't drop vs. making a new character dedicated to frigate PvP and looking for good fights in FW space. I ended up doing the latter and have gotten into it on and off for a few weeks total: https://zkillboard.com/character/2114970896/
---
Fun as edge-of-your-seat, fast-paced, relatively-common frigate PvP is in FW space ... my normal play hours still tend to be a bit slow to keep me entertained enough to play regularly (Eve's busiest hours every day are the only hours I basically can never get online for, rip). So my current eve goals are limited to sitting in +5s in jita and logging in once every 2-4 days when I can be assed to eat a cerebral accelerator so that I've got more SP to work with if Eve ever lures me back again in the future.
---
Hope you enjoyed my story. I know I enjoyed typing it from the shitter at my in-laws where I am hiding from everyone.
---
I did! Don't use them much but it's still a cool feeling.
---
Cool thanks for the Info. Is the Caldari/Gallente Zone still bigger than the Amarr/minmatar one(read this somewhere)?
---
Very nice fight man, congrats. Thanks for sharing o7
---
Don't treat ship purchases in Eve like in other MMOs my guy, you'll buy and lose hundreds of individual ships if you keep playing this game; I have.
---
So don't think to hard about it and just give it a shot
---
Yes, it's worth starting. Don't worry about catching up, you can get almost perfect skills for specialities within a couple months of playing.
---
A bit of advice, stay away from this subreddit. The community here is mainly a bunch of bitter doomsayers and assholes.
---
Obvious EVE rip. SG is from China, they don't give a shit. CCP could, and should, sue the piss out of them but Chinese courts won't do squat against SG. 
---
Seeing SG just made me want to play EVE again, so there's that.
---
You did better than I did. I got to that point, used them a couple times in a year, then decided "fuck this shit" and liquidated everything.
---
One of their corps just joined Tri lol.
---

---
what ever you do, dont get a thrasher. people will see you and be so afraid that you'll never get a fight
---
If you don't want to pve anymore, then you can extract most of the skills you used to do so previously and sell the injectors to continue to fund your omega and gameplay.

---
&lt;3 :( o7
---
&gt;  46dp is unpenetrable by means of effective offensive structrure placing?
---
77S and 46DP aren't impenetrable due to structures. It's jump ranges that make them a pain in the ass. One side or the other has to jump in with the big toys. There's no escalation path when that happens, or did you forget when TEST lost the Komodo several months ago in 77S with our super fleet right there?
---
Fair enough, I will go scold my hearsayers for relaying inaccurate information.
---
Oh yeah and super unrealistic because of tournament ships etc. Something to work towards though :)
---
Edit: Maybe I can just start off with everything in the ship tree.
---
No goals. I'm here to shit up comms and have fun.
---
The game is not in the best state at the moment, but is still worth playing mostly.
---
Ok thanks so just stick to cheap close range
---
Your videos are on par with "active hacs go". Love having a watch, and I think it brings back the love for BS.
---
You'll lose every ship type. Eve is a game where you only fly what you are willing to lose.

I got a thrasher and a amarr one not the dragoon

The Hyperion will always be my favorite ship. Battleship, active rep, looks like the Yamato, hits like a truck and can be virtually immortal(NOS pls go)

tell me something and be honest, how close is your face to the screen and exactly how much drool is there on your keyboard?
---
Furries everywhere. I like turtles.
---
Yea that post is even more confusing. But it's cool. Clearly there isn't much consensus on the subject. As that post implies it's referring to the actual wormhole not the system but then says constellations in jove space.. 
---
So it's more accurate to say there is c1-6 then shattereds  and the special ones. But that's fine.
---
Is a turtle your fursona?

Dude, you've got PanFam flair, you guys have spent *years* profiting from a rental alliance literally named BOT which, unsurprisingly, was also on the list of all time top botters. People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.

It's the fursona for SPVG. Scroll down Mumble channels; see Order of the Turtle? It's not only a corp meme, but we have initiation for that. Also, Wolf Pack's - our small gang group. We like wolves, too. And coyotes.

I'll be there.
---
Yet that same game is the reason you are here investing so much energy salting this thread.
---
Abyssal sites can actually be good fun for you two together, too. And they only need frigates / ass frigs. 
---
You can do T3/T4s together for like, 250-500m/hr in cheap fits. (Those numbers are estimated. In T5s I make about a bil/hr, so assuming 3s and 4s are half that, respectively).
---
Fucking feyth too when we had to mad grab it.
---
If you're just fighting frigates, you should be fine with cheap stuff. But make sure it's got the range you want. The further away you can be the better.
---
Ok and is it worth getting projectile weapons or just using energy wepons
---
The best advice I can give you is being able to undock a ship isn't the same as flying one make sure your skills are atleast 3 or 4 and look thru the skill list for supporting skills if you still have an issue message me and I'll help with a good fit
---
Mmm burning co2 space. Hours of uncontested toasting in my nerus
---
For me, creating the story is the part that interests me the most. It requires a bit of capital and training so I'm just doing what I can and gaining some experience here, and there. I've had no end of fun ideas in my head that could create an interesting scenario for the people involved. That's it really. Sounds really campy but the stories of intrigue and piracy always got me excited to play.
---
At the moment I do a number of things, exploration, mining, ratting. Whatever it takes at the moment to build up my main and become self-sufficient.
---
The goal should not be to get to a point where your earning enough isk to pay for plex each month, join a Corp (small one) make friends, have fun, FW is a great place to start.
---
Cynabals are cool. Not too fond of the hull's aesthetics but the stats are great. 
---
How do you feel about Vagabonds btw?
---
mfw hyperion is literally a mini-haw dread
---
Please try
---
Probably covered already but regardless of which tank the alliance is using at the time in need, all other links get used. The idea is kinda "why not take all the 'buffs'?". And very often if pilots are available links are doubled up for a safety precaution. 
---
Training command ships in their entirety with all skills for links, tank, etc is a LONG train as others have stated but command ships almost always will be #1 or #2 (after logi) for priority. You want overkill for damage but there's a point when too much overkill becomes inefficient if there's no tackle, links, logi, etc.  
---
Command ships have a very high value and more often than some other roles not enough supply (pilots with the skills and desire to fly them)
---
I started in spring of 2005. I began soon to trade. It didn't require so much skill training. Then I turned to pvp which is a lot more skill intensive. But that matters not so much, and do you know why? In order to learn PvP it is natural to start with frigates, and to train those skills to an acceptable level, you'll only need about three weeks, maybe two. And then as your proficiency increases, so will the number of skills you have... And then there will be cruisers, et cetera.
---
Anyway, Eve is the most rewarding game I have ever played. Find your own way of playing it. 
---
I play solo pvp. I am 40+, and I play solo because RL obligations make it the most viable option, and of course, I guess it is my preferred style no matter what the status of my RL is. I always find the time. Good luck!
---
gonna tell you something, it's even more fun to win when outnumbered
---
wow, gold. Thank you kind stranger :D
---
So ignoring all the doom and gloom lately. Most new Bros get decent advice from r/eve. Altho there is alot of salt cuz there's a big feeling that ccp dosent know what they're doing or how to fox anything.
---
That being said it's still the same game as before just alot of changes. I don't recommend missions, they pay shit and are boring. Of your not interested in pvp than move to nullsec and run all the pve till your heart's content. 
---
Now if you want to play eve like it's ment to be. Dangerous and invigorating move to a wormhole.i recommend a class 2 till you get your bearings. Highsec is mostly only good for afk mining really. Altho there is new invasion content in HS. That has also recently moved to lowsec lol.
---
Command destroyers are another option that also opens up providing defender missiles and micro jump portal roles. Command destroyers aren't given as much value for links per se but if it means having extra links, it's generally well received by the FC (in my experience).
---
It's really easy to fabricate Discord messages via. browser. "Logs" are not particularly trustworthy if they're coming from Discord. This goes for just about every place on the internet aswell.

"being behind" isn't really a problem.. there is nothing you need to get ahead of. There is no race to be max level or anything so there is no rush. Your competing with yourself. And you can inject the skills you want if you have the money.
---
Eve is nothing like factorio btw.. pi and building stuff KIND OF but nothing in the same vain as building your own mega base or anything. 
---
Just play the game don't worry about skills try and find something you enjoy doing.

This shows most if not all the jobs you can find yourself doing in eve. Try as many as you can.

You do know if you get your wish the server can just shutdown right?
---
Goons will control 90% of the map.
---
Afaik the qualification you need to JOIN test is a pulse, so
---
"Now" as in the past few months? Yeah
---
People seem to vouch for projectile weapons, but I've actually never really used them beyond small projectile weapons, so I can't say much on them. But people really like them a lot. Energy weapons don't have much room in PVP fleets, not so much that they're bad, just that there are better weapons out there.
---
Here's an excerpt from the Eve Uni wiki if it's any help:
---
&gt;Autocannon, which have short ranges, good tracking, and deal high DPS; and
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Artillery, which have long ranges, very poor tracking, and deal less DPS.

Woah! If I was in this situation I would've probably broke anchor and shot the secondary, this is some high skilled PVP! WOW!

what makes the pacifier special?
---
Get the Gallente Algos... Drones are good at this.

short answer: command ships of all factions are used. I see Gallente a bit less often but they are still good and get used.

I click things and lose isk.  My goal is to eventually click things and gain isk.

I just with the maelstrom had another mid. It has a great tank bonus but not enough mids for application + tank in a BS.

I disagree. No risk involved just to try Eve. You'll learn a lot and will experience something quite unique in the world of gaming.
---
Wow, now someone take the TAPI narrative from when PL+NC+MC+etc. teamed up to kick us out from the North, and see a dictionary definition of hypocrisy.
---
Destroy test from the inside with bitterness and sarcasm
---
Nice one!
---
Hell yeah, good job :D
---
Hehe, that shouldnt stop you

Sounds nice :D
---
I just like warp accerleration and the bonuses.
---
blob
---
I miss someone finding our narrative when we were being evicted from Vale by PL who teamed up with everyone else there, and looking at TAPI now teaming up with Goons to kick out someone way smaller than either of them.  Hypocritical much?
---
Nah for the explore mission where you have to take out the enemy
---
The lastest spin is all that matters
---
The question is significantly complicated by the addition of the word **best**. CCP are tuned into r/eve and social media and pay attention to their forum. However the general impression is that feedback is unwelcome, though they pay it plenty of lip service. So there is no **good** way to provide it at all, much less a best way.
---
The most **official** way to provide feedback is on the forum: https://forums.eveonline.com/c/technology-research/player-features-ideas
---
T3c's have 3 bonuses. You could then provided boosts and logi at the same time.
---
Job done
---
Ps. T3c takes less time to fully train
---
This. Only thing I would change is 2 too take r/eve with a grain of salt.. most of us have been here for long enough to see the amount of shit ccp does and says... There's alot of things that need ajusting and they aren't big enough to manage it all.
---
Most of the problems we bring up on Reddit are due to frustration and a sense of feeling like ccp has no idea what they're doing.. or no plan.. no road map..
---
Don't need it. It's called team viewer mate. Your welcome I recommend a tablet

Looks pretty even to me. This was entosis this morning for several hours in Detorid. https://fleetcom.space/battlereport/KoMPshoJcSyinTjMA
---
Again, FRT stands down vs. just us in CNTZ for 12 ihub pops, then batphones and reforms at 10:00 with PanFam. Goons showed then, not earlier. Maybe if they leave PanFam at home, and stop batphoning in CNTZ, we can have a nice, little war. But PandaFam is never gonna do that. All total, we popped 16 ihubs in Detorid, the majority before Goons even left Delve. It's pretty clear what the titan/super numbers are now with FRT showing their full deck on the Keepstar the other day. And you and I both know it's about numbers in sups and tits, so stop making this argument about total numbers in alliances and use your brain. Did you see any Goon supers/titans running around. Yeah, me neither.
---
Thanks, chief!
---
My pleasure, no worries! Have a good one!
---
My goal is to see NC undock and PandaFam to lose their entire super fleet.
---
For the record:  
---
The original camp went down, and the Cerbs got deleted.  Three times.
---
Plex sale is the only one what would do anything. So events just give them more so to extract this costing even more Plex.
---
No point in me or my corp roaming nullsec with all the intel alts + local.

One mistake and the entire region is now deserted, and if it isn't, youre getting blobbed with 3-5x your numbers.

What's wrong with "they attacked us, so we won a war and they paid us not to evict them, then they declared war again so now we're going to win again"?

Please do so we have something else to shit on.

hey, at least we're not rocking a dead alliance flair in 2019, am i rite? a shame really, as WinterCo sure could use that vallued ally flair bait right about now.

Again, FRT stands down vs. just Legacy in CNTZ for 12 ihub pops, then batphones and reforms at 10:00 with PanFam. Goons showed then, not earlier. Maybe if they leave PanFam at home, and stop batphoning in CNTZ, we can have a nice, little war. But PandaFam is never gonna do that.

---
You poor bastard.
---
It would contradict it if we weren't looking at plex. Try to think of it this way. Everything in the game has gotten cheaper...making ISK seem more valuable. But ISK and all non plex items in game are only valued relative to each other. PLEX is the only metric that uses RL currency. So while ISK is more powerful/can buy you more stuff relative to things like ships and modules, it's actually weaker looking at PLEX...as is everything else. You need more ISK (or in game materials in value) in order to get PLEX. You can only judge inflation/real value of things in game based on PLEX.  
---
Years and years of streaming ISK faucets has depleted the value of ISK/in game materials and we know this because of PLEX.
---
GF's to everyone involved.
---
and if you don't like mining, I would recommend lowsec/nullsec/WH exploration(targeting mainly relic sites, followed by data sites).  It can be done in a cheap 1M exploration frigate with a low skill investment(all the skills in scanning to 3) and go from there.  
---
Been at the game a few months, and its still fun, profitable, AND gives me time(skill wise and play wise) to do other things ingame too.  In my case finding deals on minerals, building stuff out of them, and trying to sell them.  Not going too well, but exploration gives me something to do in the mean time(while things are building or sitting on the market).  
---
Exploration gets me to different regions to see their markets and buy up what I need.  Wormholes give me shortcuts to trade hubs when I find them to stock up.  Occasionally I drive an industrial loaded to the brim with minerals purchased at a good price through the wormhole route I found back home.  
---
Now I'm slowly looking into more combat oriented parts of eve's pve(Could have started sooner, but I joined a nullsec alliance basically right off the bat, and difficulty of pve generally scales the lower security status gets, from 1.0-0.5 being highsec, 0.4-0.1 being lowsec, and 0.0 being nullsec.
---
Limit number of blues / friendlies any character can have. Bring it down to the point where mistakes can be actually made during combat by those who don't pay enough attention.
---
I almost feel bad for you.
---
We are there every night. You guys should stop by more often :p
---
I just picked up the game a week or two ago. Do they have an accessible api?
---
~~Pandemic~~ Potatoe Legion...
---
Nah, they have slower lock times then caps and their mobility sucks real bad as well.
---
I'd give them all a flat 10% buff to lock times, alignment times, targeting range, warp Accel and base movement rates. This would be on top of appreciate ehp buff, armor for armor and shield for shields.
---
Just try them out man. Lots of things counter each other. So dont get overly invested in a single ship. Yeah some are nice to fly now and enjoy it while you fly it. End of the day is it's a game so feel it out and figure out what you want to fly
---
pity you weren't able to accomplish that before failscading
---
Cyclone has a nice layout for brawling active tank. If only pith x types were still 100mil....
---
Dont sour his koolaid !

Thanks I'll do that
---
Rolled a nice 500mn MWD looking for a sale so I can fund a fit to start in t4's :D

But specifically for exploring. I would highly recommend the astero or t1 frig that gets bonuses. Destroyers are more combat oriented

Ok thanks

&gt;panfam flair

Wait im in panfam?
---
Groups like TAPI will never understand that.
---
My goal in Eve started out as wanting to own a Titan just cause it was the big bad ship and looked cool. I do own one now and enjoy it but haven‚Äôt gotten to use it in big fights yet. I‚Äôm next shooting for a Revenant.
---
Currently I‚Äôm focused on being the best Logi Anchor I can be and promote a healthy alliance. Keep people invested and wanting to play the game.
---
Few things:
---
* requires rank 1 of all racial frigates instead of racial 5 for the specialized covops, you can be flying it really quickly
---
* has less CPU BUT 100% cloak CPU reduction is built in, so you can fly it much sooner and fit easier
---
* better agility than all other T2 covops so you move around faster and more efficiently
---
* 10% warp speed and acceleration per level - this is super important when warping around a lot, and with hyperspatial rigs you almost reach 20 AU/s
---
* can even fight and tank if situation demands it, better than other T2 covops
---
ninja edit: also lower sig radius and nearly double the scan resolution of other T2 covops. Marginally useful.
---
&gt;had a love for the look of amarr ships
---
Grandpa' had some damn good taste.
---
I rate your rating system 11 whole Wombats.
---
Uh....ok
---
Do you do this in anoms in null? How do you avoid getting murdered ?
---
Real talk, if Eve dies, it'll be trash like you that killed it.
---
My goal was to make my EVE living from PvP and be able to PLEX my accounts with that ISK. I succeeded this around a year ago and continue to do so.
---
Can‚Äôt insure a praxis tho
---
There are many many areas of the game where other characters skills are completely irrelevant to playing, only whether you can defeat the challenge from the developers, such as missions, deadspace, exploration. Then there are areas of the game where personal skill / dedication / intelligence are important and not character skill, such as leading a corporation, economic success, etc.
---
I would recommend creating an account with someone‚Äôs recruit-a-friend link, as you can get 1million skill points to jump start your advancement. Then if you are liking it you can buy the $5 eve-store starter DLC for another 1m. That‚Äôll take you about half of the way to the 5m alpha cap.
---
That's not a mission then...
---
You mean combat sites?
---
Honest question here, what would you recommend someone try for income outside of subcap anom ratting?
---
Probe is the way to go. So cheap you can make your invest back plus some after your first site.
---
Nah, it's more fun to kill the people who think they're good enough to fight outnumbered.
---
With the exception of krabs, they produce the most salt when they lose.
---
Just to be clear, emerging conduits can be done solo ... and just barely (unlikely if he‚Äôs a newer player), minor and major conduits are pretty much fleet only content.
---
Good. Then we'll finally be free of this godforsaken game.
---
There needs to be a whole separate subreddit for these posts
---
The Dragoon is a solid platform both as a stand-alone and as a fleet-support vessel.    
---
However, for exploration, you're better off utilizing either the Magnate (for scanning/data/relic) or the Venture (ninja-mining)
---
Marauders are great, but are rattlesnakes better? You don't have to sit sieged for a minute if gankers come in

why

Why would anyone want to turn off 2FA? o_O

Because they were AFK it looks like.

Sorry for the loss of your friend. He would have been happy with the defense that you DID put up with the odds that were against you.

Better spin is Immensea is on the verge of collapse from attacks by them. I havent seen an attack from Winter Coalition of Bots since... oh wait... I forgot it's been that long. If he is talking about those pitiful structures in E8, those were all from his allies and not FRT.

If you wanna "catch up", you have already lost, at least your possibility having fun. Do not try it.

In EVE two things matter: first your fun and your goals. Whatever they are. The second is the road, while you achive them. Rinse and repeat these two things, and you will enjoy the ride in this game.
---
Find a Corp and you'll find friends. The game is mostly about comunity. There's alot of things you should probably know but the list is to long. Ask YouTube theres usually good newbro videos there. Also eve uni is a great place for newbros.

It‚Äôs headed to serenity 2.0 and that‚Äôs the issue here it doesn‚Äôt matter what happens in between or who wins by the end of it there will be only one dominant force in the server with no one else even close to contesting them you could potentially say that at this point in the game but sooner rather than later all
---
Null if not most of null will be blue
---
Just got to be aware of your surroundings. Helps to have friends in surrounding system who can give you a heads up if hostiles are coming your way. Failing that, you can always have alts scout those systems.
---
Local alone isn't really enough for these setups, since battleships are super slow. If a tackler comes into system while you're in warp, you're fucked. Even if you do everything right, a good sabre pilot can get on top of you before you manage to warp off. Knowing what's happening in the systems around you is important.
---
It's obviously not cost effective during blackouts, so I wouldn't try it then. The dotlan ratting index will attract a cloaky dropper in hours, and unless you're glued to your screens 24/7 with unwavering attention, even putting scouts on entrances won't help you avoid those. You'll  most likely get turbodunked before you can even make up the cost of the ships, let alone make any profit.
---
hey guys here's the exucse as to why 3/4 of 0.0 has to team up to win a fight.
---
nobody cares about what excuses you use to kill the game
---
Samara is the worst, Melinda is the best
---
I blame you tbh.
---
A group of people got together in spaceships and went to shoot another group of people in space ships.. it was all very annoying and boring

Nice explanation, I like it a lot ü§£

Stay out of Jita local, always. Nothing but scammers and sperg lords

Don‚Äôt ask questions on Reddit.   That‚Äôs all you need know

Wait so based on the title, I‚Äôm assuming y‚Äôall are clearing out Tama gate camps? Praise the lord. I would prefer to get into Tama and *then* do PvP(AKA playing whack-a-mole in and around complexes), rather then getting into Tama and immediately getting jumped by a couple of insta-lock destroyers on the Gate
---
The great one. With DRF and NC
---
Nc pushed out the residents and drf took over.
---
So say we all
---
For exploration?  Meaning scanning sigs?  A destroyer is not meant for that.  You could save money for an astero, but its not necessary. Save up for a sisters probe launcher and sister probes
---
I want to build a Titan by myself, that is my current goal
---
Considering how often the fights aren‚Äôt fair there(I‚Äôve tried going there and soloing with a t1 frigate, and usually get jumped by Pirate/higher tier frigs which usually kill me) I‚Äôve ended up only fighting there with a friend with me, so we can dunk on solo ships, and if there‚Äôs another pair of ships roaming... well the 2v2 is fun
---
To join darkness and become a director, then stab sort in the back and steal everything that isn't nailed to the ground

Ok... thanks üòì

Are solo BS shenanigans back in fashion again after cyno changes?
---
Come and join us. What's the worst that could happen? You will get some assistance with early sp which is a big help. Join a new person Corp like EVE Uni or something similar and try to find something that interests you. It's still a great game regardless of all the salt thrown around here.
---
If You can get a group of like-minded bros to achieve a common goal or setup your own corp/alliance or do the stuff You wanna do do then ye it will definitively be a blast : )
---
yikes
---
Do the tutorial missions, and then forget that the concept of missions exists in EVE. Join a corp. Do some stuff with other people. Being solo in EVE is crap. Doesn't really matter what you end up doing, just do it with other people.
---
one joke...
---
Careful what you wish for...
---
We are there every night ... If not on the gate then station or plexes. Hull Pen lives there. Come PvP against us or with us just hit up MadMatt 420 and i will get you a invite. COME TO TAMA. Make lowsex great again.
---
Wait what are you confused about?
---
The universe eve is in has no obligation to follow our laws of physics I gues
---
Yea, Not really sure how to go about selling things that take time.  Its my first major isk item so ive put it everywhere xD

Fair enough.

Just searching on YouTube you get hits for "eve northern war"...

---
I don't understand why all weapons don't have infinite range.
---
Apply to Eve university. Run the tutorial missions. Focus on simply enjoying the Eve universe. When you find a challenge which would be easier with friends, get some. Don‚Äôt cheat yourself out of player interactions by rolling alts to overcome obstacles. Don‚Äôt turn Eve into a grind by trying to PLEX your account.

How would you meet other people. I'm also a newbie
---
A rocket can only go so far with limited propellant, the guns can only go so far without loosing it‚Äôa limited velocity and becoming irrelevant in terms of damage. And lasers... well idk enough about that to really give you an answer. But it all comes down to game balance. Got to suspend disbelief for some of the stuff that‚Äôs in eve
---
Nice.
---
I've always felt that for at least missiles, there is an effective range so that the missiles aren't avoided by evasive actions. 
---
For lasers, I assume that there is diminishing effects after a certain point due to the power required or what the crystal is able to produce.
---
Projectiles, uh. Magic.
---
Hybrids, uh. Double magic?
---
Yup same. But six total accounts, one for shield super fleet one for armor super fleet
---
Lasers lose focus after too far, ceasing to be a damaging ray and becoming just a bright light.
---
Physical objects have to lead their target. You have to shoot your bullet ahead of your target, so the bullet and ship get to the same point in space at the same time. If you're too far away, those calculations get worse and worse to maintain, and either the bullet doesn't hit as squarely as you'd hoped, or it just misses completely and drifts off into the void.
---
But ultimately... yes, it's a science fail. The reason we have ranges is b/c there is resistance in space. Bullets slow down, which is why they deal less damage the further they go into Falloff. It's also why ships stop if the engines aren't running constantly, and why they slow down if you turn off your prop mod. And why ships eventually level themselves out and float if you aren't going anywhere.
---
Eve Online claims to be about spaceships, but it's really submarines. Which must mean that Genesis 1:6 was right, outer space is water... =)
---
I agree all but energy weapons should have unlimited range. However rocket, torps and miss, should have a limited amount of fuel before they can‚Äôt maneuver into their target. But I think that they need a range otherwise the calculations for the computer to calculate damage and hit chance would catch fire if they tried to do it.
---
And Harted is #1
---
Join a player corporation and you'll meet other people. 
---
Also, joining in on public activities like spectre fleet, incursion running, invasion running, etc. There are quite a few publicly open activities that will give you an opportunity to meet new people.

played on and off since 2008, left the game 2 years ago...tell me how to make 700 mill per day and i ll come back.

True lol.

Rockets and Bullets should not slow down in space.
---
only because eve has drag in space. otherwise I point to this Mass Effect Quote:
---
**Gunnery Chief:**  
---
 This, recruits, is a 20-kilo  ferrous slug. Feel the weight. Every five seconds, the main gun of an  Everest-class dreadnought accelerates one to 1.3 percent of light speed.  It impacts with the force of a 38-kiloton bomb. That is three times the  yield of the city-buster dropped on Hiroshima back on Earth. That means  Sir Isaac Newton is the deadliest son-of-a-bitch in space. Now!  Serviceman Burnside! What is Newton's First Law?
---
**Serviceman Burnside:**  
---
 Sir! An object in motion stays in motion, sir!
---
 No credit for partial answers, maggot!
---
 Sir! Unless acted on by an outside force, sir!
---
  Damn straight! I dare to assume you ignorant jackasses know that space  is empty. Once you fire this hunk of metal, it keeps going till it hits  something. That can be a ship, or the planet behind that ship. It might  go off into deep space and hit somebody else in ten thousand years. If  you pull the trigger on this, you are ruining someone's day, somewhere  and sometime. That is why you check your damn targets! That is why you  wait for the computer to give you a damn firing solution! That is why,  Serviceman Chung, we do not "eyeball it!" This is a weapon of mass  destruction. You are not a cowboy shooting from the hip!
---
**Serviceman Chung:**  
---
 Sir, yes sir!
---
Wait there's resistance in space?
---
Thank you!
---
Yeah I guess it comes down to balance. But I have to correct you, in space there is no drag so there'd be no damage drop off.
---
Interesting, guess I was talking out of my ass. Thanks for the info!
---
My goal was to make a couple of friends, chew rocks and kick ass  
---
I got the chew rock parts, made a bunch of friends, but my ass has been kicked dozens of times. Still fun :) My current goal is to get a hyperion and get into an honest 1v1 fight with someone, Standard solo battleship slugfest, maybe in jita or something if i set up a duel.
---
how do you kill in an endurance?
---
My goal was to do BLOPS. Everything I did, every isk I made on my main was to fly a redeemer, force recons and inject that stupid JDC5. I bought a second monitor and I created a couple cyno alts and hunter, but I fucked up and created those on the wrong accounts so that was useless. (I know, I can ask to move them, I'll do that, eventually xD ). In the same time on an alt, I trained for jump freighters with the goal to provide JF service to the corp
---
I got the redeemer with the shiny fit, I was so happy, it cost me an arm but no matter ! I even got to jump it once to a staging station. It is still there where I parked it more than a year ago, because then I stop EVE for a year and when I sort of came back, my alliance disolved and I never got to use it xd 
---
So now I got a main with BLOPS capabilities but the wrong one (as I think everyone is using a sin or a panther) and 0 experience in using it, and a alt with JF capabilities but I'm too poor to buy one and I'm in NPC corp so I really don't need one
---
Well, that was a waste of time :d
---
Make SOV work similar to how PlanetSide 1 worked. If anyone here is familiar with that. No more headshotting. Losing certain systems causes you to lose certain abilities. It would be more grindy feeling, but headshots are boring.
---
What are the major issues with cynos that should have been addressed?
---
submarine game
---
For the guns it's their ability to effectively track that determine the range, notice how some ranges have minimum ranges too? Inside that range they can't swivel fast enough to track a target accurately. Too far and the tracking predictions get less accurate. Swap ammo and the different mass of the round changes the ranges. For energy weapons it's probably got to do with the area the beam is best focused into for maximum effect, as well as ability to track still. 
---
Missiles eventually run out of fuel, at which point they can no longer correct their course and self destruct for safety.
---
Not in our space. But there is resistance in Eve. All the physics behavior in game acts as though we're driving submarines through water, rather than spaceships through vacuum. That's why missiles have a limited flight time before they just stop going anywhere. If they were traveling through vacuum, they would fly in a straight line forever. But if they were "underwater", they'd run out of fuel and come to a stop.
---
You can do something really well like bombers and be able to get in on a lot of content, only a few weeks and you can start killing capitals and vets with a bunch of your friends.
---
You can then specialize in other things in the background.
---
I endorse any product and/or service that makes lowsec great again
---
If you go dual rep on the VNI you also need double cap boosters, or else the tank is really unstable and even the slightest neut pressure will fuck you.
---
No I wouldn‚Äôt, that sub is worse than ass cancer
---
idk maybe people doing flips and shit on subs/roaming gangs 
---
let me tell you JFs arent doing flips and shit on your tristan
---
If you truly think it's only about supers &amp; titans, you're gravely mistaken.
---
Then again, coming from the Alliance that boast having the "2nd largest supercapfleet in the game", you don't think that this argument is kinda failed on you ?
---
But nice to know we have fleets going up for some other business than bashing the dead DEADCO.
---
My headcanon has always been that the warp drive is always online, and when not fully active the tiny warp bubble in the core actually drags on spacetime itself at standard speeds. Only when the drive is fully active for a warp across a system, fully encompassing the ship does the effect flip to the frictionless effect where it can just slide through to its destination point (unless interdicted) without issue. 
---
But one could claim, too that because the Eve cluster is separated from the Milky Way, that conditions might be different in that small cluster. A higher particle count in space due to thicker nebulae (perhaps it's a far younger area of space, we have no idea how far from the Milky Way is from the Eve cluster, could be half the universe for all we know) which *does* cause some drag to occur effecting propulsion, weapons, etc...
---
The reason why our ships have resistance is because our warp drives drag against the fabric of space-time. We can't just turn them off to negate that because starting up a drive is a lengthy and time-consuming process.     
---
The reason why missiles have a range is because eventually they run out of fuel, and when they do they just sail off in the direction they were going. They aren't going to hit their target unless the target is going in a perfectly straight line away from them, which is pretty rare, so the limited range is an acceptable approximation.
---
Confirmed.

adapt or die

I have achieved so many little goals over the years.  Starting small and grinding away at them.  
---
A solo kill.  
---
Owning a freighter and flying for Red Frog.  
---
Flying a jump freighter for Black Frog.  
---
After seeing my first Titan (when they were less common) I wanted one of them (now I have several).  
---
Flying with the Imperium/Goonswarm was a goal from why back in the day as well.  
---
Being in a 4000+ fleet fight.  
---
List probably goes on and on with regard to little things that kept me playing. 
---
Now...not sure.  Maybe it‚Äôs mining one of each Titan of the core races Titan.   Probably the main goal now is just to have fun and hang with people I enjoy playing with.
---
EVE does not have drag in space. Our warp drives drag against the fabric of space-time but everything else obeys the laws of physics.
---
:realchamp:
---
Who were the guys who did that podcast that had the "TAMA...IS...SAAAAAAFE!" bit?  I miss those guys.  And that podcast.
---
not anymore get rekt
---
To be fair, the range of eve weapons is only calculated in the concept of for how long the technology is accurate,A gun's "optimal range" is the range within which distance has no effect on hit chance.
---
Accuracy falloff begins at the end of optimal range. Falloff measures how quickly the chance to hit decreases as the target distance grows *beyond* optimal range. At a gun's optimal range *plus* its falloff, the chance to hit is reduced to 50%. At a gun's optimal range plus *twice* the falloff range, the chance to hit is reduced to only 6.25%
---
so it dont say the projectile stops, just that it miss the target.  
---
 [as explained by this gif](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/images/d/d0/QST_turret_range.gif)
---
that actual space battle would probably be fought at tens of thousands of kilometers where if your lucky to look out a window at the correct time you might notice a small gleam in the distant darkness before your shit was ripped apart by extreme force, is a entire different story.
---
Before the cyno change i seeded industrials to my cyno locations. Does make it a dick to make a new cyno chain though.
---
because technically, in the void, once pushed something should not stopped until attracted by something bigger. So technically a projectile weapon has infinite range :D 
---
see my favorite miniscene in the citadel : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tIk-vUtLBs :D
---
I'm not even sure. It's actually a little hard to understand how this game has got so unbalanced towards capitals. Put three smart people in a room for a month. Look at the numbers, play the game. Make suggestions for balance to the community, listen to feedback, adjust accordingly. 
---
Balance.
---
Don't fly what you can't afford to lose.
---
Ships are consumable resources, not assets you'll hold for a long time.  Don't get attached to them.
---
That's some nice editing. Great work specte fleet.
---
Yeah OK.
---
biggest mistake i see new people make is going to bs right away when you can do more in a frig in the earlier days
---
Settle down hauler, this is the cHaOs oF eReA
---
Cyno changes never affected wormholes :P
---
Lol I am not even an indy/logistics pilot but ever thought about: Do ONE trip with compressed ore buy industrial bpcs and produce them local? Took me like a min to fix your MEMEME all changes are bad I do not want to adapt problem.The cyno changes are good: Every cyno with pvp potential is sth that you commit to: If you want to safe your rorq form an attacker you better be ready to lose that \~400m cyno ship and you better have backup cynos in fleet cause you might lose your original one -&gt; Super Umbrellas got nerfed which is a REALLY good thing.(Just one of the benefits - there are others)
---
In the words of Sgany below: adapt or die
---
Do you have a Spotify playlist of the stuff you use in your videos? Awesome stuff man
---
Yeah true.
---
Ah yeah that's what I was asking about. Thanks for clearing that up :)
---
Lasers: Lasers attenuate (spread out) after a relatively short distance. They're like a pressure washer, lethal at close range and harmless at a sufficient distance.          
---
Projectile weapons: When fighting a moving target your guns need to lead the target in order to hit it. The farther away your target is, the more time they have to make corrections to dodge your fire. The reason why you have damage falloff is because guns are not perfectly precise, there are fraction-of-a-degree imprecisions in the path of the projectile from the gun which translate into increasingly larger inaccuracies over range. So a shot which would have hit a critical system would instead glance off a plate, or miss entirely.           
---
Missiles: When missiles run out of fuel they keep travelling in a straight line until they hit something. They won't hit their target unless it is travelling perfectly along their trajectory, which is exceedingly unlikely. Thus, missiles simply no longer working beyond a certain range is an acceptable approximation of reality.          
---
Drones: While drones have no warp drives, and thus do not suffer from drag against space-time, their targeting systems are relatively primitive compared to those on their mothership. Thus they need to maintain a lower speed relative to their target in order to maintain accurate fire.
---
This makes a lot of sense. Thanks :)
---
Wow
---
So true lol.
---
&gt;all but energy weapons should have unlimited range
---
That would make even less sense. Guns need to lead their targets, and the further a target is the more time they have to make course corrections to avoid incoming fire.
---
What do you mean by bs?
---
Infinite range, sure, but that doesn't mean a gun can perfectly hit anything at any range.
---
Yeah no problem :) It's basically all to do with the forces. The reason there's drag on Earth is because the particles in the atmosphere are applying a force to the bullet, but in space where there's very little to no particles, no force will be applied. The rocket's propellant accelerates it, not moves it. Once it runs out of fuel it could, theoretically, travel at that same velocity until the end of the universe.
---
I know it's bad when I agree with a Custer post
---
Nice reply. Thanks very much :) I haven't really had any experience with drones yet but I'd like to check them out.
---
It's not the drives themselves it's the PEGS that run them( I can't find the chronical atm but it's out there) the same place our ships get infinite energy.
---
well, once the bullet has reach the proper speed, it WILL hit something at some point. Doesn't have to be your target indeed :D
---
I mean, i dident say it was a great way to explain it, but lt its the way eve works, they had to make some type of system i guess, and unlimited range just seems weird and broken.
---
sorry for your loss
---
hahaha, like 3 different persons posted the Mass Effect bit :D
---
battle ship
---
So SF is ready to take on The Officer Spawn again?
---
You can get started YES - the skillpoint gap is noticable first but decreases over time. Just realize one thing - Eve is a VERY social game and the fun comes with interacting and building a social network around you. For that very reason I suggest you go out and seek a group of nerds after you understood the basics of the game to a certain degree.
---
Focus on one Skillpath and commit to it. I started \~2.5years ago - Took me one month to get started and I started Fcing (leading a fleet of nerds to Valhalla) 3 months in. You might not be able to fly all ships but you can get one ship (esp. small frigs/dessies) trained to almost max really fast and the rest comes down to how you react with your community - know your enemy + their ships. Know what your friends are capable of etc.
---
Oh
---
lool sorry didn't even open the vid :D
---
/r/evejobs is another great sub for recruiting
---
Just to clarify though, do you mean exploration like data and relic sites or do you mean literally for wandering the universe and exploring?
---
In both cases I'd actually suggest the dragoon anyway. The drones and mid slot layout plus potential utility high slots give it a lot more flexibility. I think the coercer is a bit more combat dedicated and actually is a great little ship as well but if I had to pick one to live out of for a week dragoon by far.
---
Yes, but the odds of a stray round hitting anything are, literally, astronomical. And in a pitched battle ships are likely making tiny corrections to avoid all the stray fire. So your weapons really don't do anything of significance past a certain range.
---
Didn't want a functional logistic chain anyway.
---
No our ships generate it with the power generators they use. They're called PEGS. 
---
Put it this way. Yes a missile with no fuel may still travel farther but there is no way to direct it. So missiles have an effective fuel range 
---
As for guns most launch something towards the opponent baring lasers and that's obvious as to why it's disipates. But back to projectiles they literally throw something towards the enemy yes it may go forever but of both ships are moving there are angles n shit that need to be calculated which gets harder based on range. So yes the shot may go forever but that dosent mean it can hit something at that range.
---
So tldr it's not because space has resistance it's because PEGS generate resistance and tracking can only be Soo good. Range is just a resresentation of your accuracy
---
&gt;play the game. Make suggestions for balance to the community, listen to feedback, adjust accordingly.
---
But they hate doing all of those things, and given how many people they fired to make the bottom line look better I can't see hilmeth "wasting" 3 people on something as stupid as balance.
---
To answer your question: Making the job of jump freightering worse than it used to be.With the "CcP cHaOs ErA", all they are doing is making random ass changes that just piss people off. Look: Blackout, which made all the hardcore pve-ers in the game throw a fit on /r/eve subreddit and it got results.
---
To answer your question in deeper detail (from my point of view):Jump freightering into remote areas of null used to be an alright task. Setting up the cyno chain from burning a ceptor to the midpoint, boarding a corvette and you had your way of getting there. Now you have to burn a hauler through nullsec to get your initial cyno... Do you see where the problem lie?  
---
Without being an actual JF/logistical pilot, you wouldn't fully understand, so I'm trying to make it clearer here.
---
One of the goals was to make null more reliant on local production vs jita. Maybe think about doing things differently?
---
My understanding is that projectiles only become really useful for artillery to alpha shit off the field immediately.
---
Lower level = more passive = less income - would do this if its my side income on the top.
---
Higher level = more complex = more income - if im gonna focus and have this as my primary source of income.
---
lol i see a lot of posts from people that wouldn't have played the free 15 days in 2012 this game is a cake walk and yes i know i have heard the horror stories of the before my time
---
Totally forgot. I spoke to the guy doing it and he said it wasn't that regular. If those are real logs, feel free to report him.
---
Why are you in hostile space... Are you trying to PVP I'm a pve game you complete and utter nitwit?
---
I guess thats where we are at. The funny part is, there wont be any pitchforking, as null bears are happy with everyone having 4 titans and 14 Rorqual alts. The madness has effectively reached the critical mass it needs for whiners to complain if things get taken away from them.
---
Don't even get me started on the blithering idiots who wanted local back in null sec. They cant see they're the ones destroying this game.
---
Time to look for another game. Space Engineers it is. Too bad SC is 15 years from release.
---
Here's a non cancer way to adapt 
---
-Deploy a raitaru in every system where you have a cyno point. 
---
-Get industrial service running, transport some mins to there with cloaky haulers and build t1 industrials.
---
-Pass off the cost to your alliance, and spam eve with more structures.
---
-Be sure to TZ tank and make the timer to be at 7 or 8 am on a tuesday.
---
All of this is non cancer and really easy. This won't make citadel spam any worse  in any way.
---
s/
---
they're the amateur Tama campers though\~
---
There is a YouTube video for anything you could possibly want to learn. Including videos on this question. Try to find ones that are within the last year or so.
---
Considering all the omega sales going on for re subbing i would assume a lot have died.
---
Ok thank you!
---
Idiot
---
Everything is the same with PI (though it‚Äôs called ‚ÄòPlanetary Production now) except for a few QOL issues that I can‚Äôt even remember. Hilmar did it and came to the conclusion that it really sucked so they made it easier to setup!
---
&gt; Do ONE trip with compressed ore buy industrial bpcs and produce them local
---
This sort of works, but there are fairly large stretches of NPC null-sec where an NPC station with manufacturing and refining capabilities does not exist. 
---
Does it seem reasonable for Black Frog, PushX, or random NPC dweller to have to try to drop a raitaru and keep it alive long enough to poop out a bunch of badgers?  Disregard the logistics of getting the structure, mods, and fuel there without a JF.  
---
The biggest complaint against industrials is just their large sized for packaged hulls.  20k m3 takes up an awful lot of space and makes pre-seeding hulls cost *in*efficient, or carrying spares difficult to fit.  
---
Allowing industrial cynos on t1 or t2 mining ships like the venture or procurer, however, would make life a little easier and also open up SLYCE to procurer blops drops again.
---
...and what about the Indy Cynos? Just because you have the ships in place doesn't mean you have the cynos to light.
---
The intial setup got a litte harder yeah but once you did the route once you can do what I proposed.  You could still supply BPCs using a ceptor and use a cheap ratting ship to get mats to reprocess for the inital first Indy ship(or even a venture tbh you do not need a lot of mats). But once your chain is runnig you should not have problems keeping it alive. (You could even use a recon for the initial setup - after that you can use the haulers with bpcs)  
---
Yeah hauling took a hit - but it is not as bad as this post suggests. You still get a chain running quite easily. The nerf to the speed at which capitals can engage and the certainty of them actually landing on grid was really needed for the health of this game.
---
Not hating on you btw - always appreciate input.
---
It depends on how many toons you have to throw at it and where you‚Äôre at/what access you have to the market! It‚Äôs very easy to extract/produce T1 stuff and sell it to people who will buy it (people in your Corp/alliance or if you have the ability to get it to a trade hub). If you have more than 1 character it‚Äôs easier to build higher tier stuff such as T2 and T3, though it requires you to move stuff around (easily done with an Epithal).
---
remember when people cried about having to train a cyno 5 toon and muh memorials? here's ur cake :))))
---
Ok, so customs offices still deployable? Thought they were phased out.
---
i like to see shit blow up your shit my shit his shit long as it blows up im happy
---
real talk right here
---
lots of luck
---
Instead of drastically altering what ships can cyno, they should have just made covert cynos inhibit normal cynos on grid.
---
Bomber decloaks, points and lights covert.  No cyno until it gets destroyed/cycles off.
---
And I think blops battleships should be able to actively disable a cyno currently lit.
---
Customs offices are still a thing and depending on the wh you'll probably have to siege the existing ones. Living in citadels is better than poses but has little impact to pi over all. They did overhaul the pi interface to make it slightly easier to use and set up and it's now all found in the agency window (i quite like the change).
---
If you are looking for a passive money maker i would recommend doing p2 components as they can reasonably be built on a single planet and greatly reduce the need for storage space.
---
I feel like there should be a modules that disables all cynos on grid both friendly and hostile that could be fit in the place of a cyno and makes the ship more vunerable by increasing the signature drasticly or lowering resistances
---
You can also produce in NPC stations etc you do not really need bonuses for a cheap t1 hauler but I do see your point: Opening up to mining barges could be a way to go forward.
---
You mean a billion isk battleship with half the ehp of tier one ships in it's class?
---
The system was intended to allow the newbie corps to thrive, the one who can't manage a 24/7 presence. It's only now that I hear the timezone tanking nerf turned ended up being to the overwhelming advantage of older, richer players. Somebody should write this down so we we'll remember it next time. I would call it Hemphill's Law.
---
games dead, gj you won
---
Not everyone wants to spend an hour mining to build their cyno nereus so that they can move someone elses courier contract man. CCP really fucked this up and I can't argue against every scenario people come up with...
---
Thankfully Brave did try to make it easy. ANIs instead of HACs etc
---
No a mudule that would increase sig by like 300% or reduce resistances by 30% so that you cant fit them to frigs without a risk or caps
---
The cyno change didn't really nerf super umbrella's, at least the Goons umbrella imo. It changed the way we work slightly, but we're still protecting supers/rorqs and still dropping on gangs in Delve. We still make sure we have fax's ready as soon as the cyno is lit to jump in and rep it.
---
All that changed is now you have people using their more useless alts to now sit in space cloaked instead of in station.
---
Most midpoints have manufacturing stations so we just build them there if they die and add the cost to overall JF fees.
---
the pcu isn't adapting
---
&lt;3
---
&gt; You can also produce in NPC stations etc
---
If, as I said, the stations have refinery or manufacturing capabilities. Many do not.  T-NNJZ is the gateway to Stain for JFs, for example, and the nearest refine/manu is 3 jumps away.  Good luck!
---
And don't even think about looking at a map of Great Wildlands if you need a JF cyno there in a hurry.
---
Allowing mining hulls to fit indy cyno would also allow the prospect to be used, which was likely the ship of choice for most cyno alts during the brief covert cyno for JFs phase.
---
And how would that be better than putting the functionality on blops?
---
Claims they do not bot
---
Has entire corporation banned for botting and RMTing
---
Has his own accounts banned by CCP
---
Is Noraus
---
Ahh yes, let's pretend that WAFFLES haven't been tied at the hip with NCPL for years. Sure.
---
Sounds nice! Got any tips on getting isk enough for a titan? Lol
---
Correct. I said unlimited range, not unlimited accuracy.
---
You could always eject and reinject?
---
Pff haha

---
Dont we al√¶ whore? Just a little? xD
---
Go for it
---
Thanks for bringing my stuff back to jita Joe :pepelove:
---
We're here to listen.  Get it all out.
---
Nope. Pos's are the only thing that's been "phased out"
---
Go for itüòÇ
---
Don't forget, you'll want to pull drones intermittently to break targeting on them (mainly if they're being shot at, otherwise they're still fine out there, or if you have enough in reserve to not worry).
---
&gt; Does it seem reasonable for Black Frog, PushX, or random NPC dweller to have to try to drop a raitaru and keep it alive long enough to poop out a bunch of badgers?
---
Actually, it does seem reasonable. Dropping a structure, or getting use of someone else's is how you make space more friendly to your operations. Why should it be easier than that to operate in space where you neither hold anything nor coordinate with people who do?
---
You could make a lot more tactics/it wouldnt be hull locked whats the point of bringing a 2b blop wich would basically be a giant target if you can just bring a deployable
---
I wish I didnt know this but; potatoes have been a major food crop diversification in modern China. They have gone from not being part of the nations diet to being the fourth major staple food. It‚Äôs a part of the plan to counter food shortages. This is all relatively recent, over the last 15 years or so. 
---
It‚Äôs quite possible this carries more weight for the intended audience. Is he saying panfam have adapted, so can they?
---
Jesus, new low on r/eve for me- discussing the cultural significance of the potato in China.
---
There are 2 main ways to make money from PI, either buy P2/3 and make P4 on factory planets in HS or make it from scratch to a certain level in other space.
---
Assuming you are making it from scratch the yields are very poor in HS and a lot of LS, though there are some decent planets in LS.  Mostly 'mining' the raw materials happens in Null or WHs.
---
If you are doing it in Null/WHs, there is huge space savings by manufacturing from P0 to P3 or P4, so people tend to export at those levels.
---
There's also the specific PI for fuel blocks (mostly P2s) or making Nanite Paste (P3) that you can also make and sell locally.
---
how, with what and where?
---
nha, EVE is about patience. I'm sure it will be usefull, eventually
---
Only if you promise to buy your modules back from us like last time!
---
I will copy paste what I said to another guy asking the same yesterday: 
---
&gt; As a relatively new player that quit a few weeks ago I would say try it, but don't feel force to commit to it.
---
&gt; The game, as you said is a very mature, it has a lot to offer in terms on variety of content in theory at least. The truth is, several of these aspects are locked behind the skill system or completely dominated by veterans. For example, marketing seems like a broad field to get into but at the end of the day you can't really compete with magnates (and bots) with billions of in game currency and thousands of market orders, on top of that you will need perfect skills just to start thinking of starting with it, which would take at least 1~2 months.
---
&gt; Do you want to PvP? Many veterans here will tell you "skills don't matter" that's also what they told me. You are left basically with two options, fly inefficient equipped and skilled frigates spending all your resources into try to learn them but ultimately keep dying to veterans with perfect skills, better ships and better modules because there is no match making system or anything similar, or die to gankers and campers. The other option is to join a big alliance.. Be prepared to keep your ship on autofollow and press F1 (fire button) on command, because that's basically all you're going to do for a long time. Not to mention that specializing in ammo and specific types of ships requires several months of skill training.
---
&gt; At the end of the day, you can have fun playing this game to a certain degree and in certain areas most than others, unless you want to spend months and months of trivial and boring activities until you have the skills/experience to have a decent amount of fun or efficiency.
---
&gt; I know this sounds pessimistic but I feel that many veterans forgot how the NPE feels like in this game, since they take for granted all the basics and even advanced skills and since they forgot what is like to start from scratch on a mature game. And I'm also aware that there are new players that stick to the game for a long time and don't mind the waiting or the inconveniences, but even CCP has confirmed on their livestreams that the game really struggles with new player retention.
---
&gt; Anyway, the game is free on the alpha clone state, no harm in trying it.

You can be having fun in fleets like the the above in under a week!

Travel ceptor sorted that rapidly. Had my chain fully functional within about an hour of logging back in after I had been on holiday. Just gotta train up the shield skills for those dank passive sigil tanks.

---
Yes.
---
In that case they already do. The range listed is the distance at which the enemy's ship can make meaningful course corrections.
---
Deployables exist and get volleyed.  They take time to setup and the target lights before it goes active.
---
Black ops would benefit by having anti cyno effects built into their kit.  And it requires the attackers accept risk to do it.
---
I think the game would be better if black ops could impede capital bridge networks, creating a black out.
---
That said, I also think that covert ops ships should also not show up in local.
---
well first you need to gather all the available energy in existence into one small point and after that detonates.....
---
To play long enough to watch null sec grow into something interesting... either a mature civilization where neutrals can pass through without harassment, or collapse into hundreds of warring constellations as region-wide alliances collapse due to some yet unforeseen mechanics.
---
Seems to me like .... collateral damage, yeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaah!
---
this is funny considering WC broke the NIP with Test early, and started the war.     Suddenly its all the Mangos fault...
---
"we"
---
High alpha and selectable damage type by ammo.
---
Hybrids actually tend to have higher raw dps, but their damage type is fixed, with ammo selected for range. 
---
Hitting someone hard and fast is nice. Hitting them hard and fast right into their resist hole, is devastating.
---
Goons were pissing everyone on reddit and in game before WWB like TEST is now? Becouse i have feeling they are even more annyoing in their shitposts.
---
what?
---
wow salty
---
hold on let me get the french fries
---
I‚Äôve mostly stuck to cloaky tengu or Stratios anom ratting in Lowsec... just as dangerous but I don‚Äôt have to worry about gate camps, and agile enough that I can run if they drop onto my site.
---
hahahah
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs mostly Lowsec anoms that I enjoy, but I have to be very cautious. Pays decent. 
---
I never find decent DED sites in HS, however in Lowsec I sometimes find a hallucinogen supply site (5/10), that‚Äôs about as tough as I can handle in the cloaky ships I tend to take to Lowsec
---
if you're in HS running missions will always be better. even L4s beat anom ratting.
---
Those never happened before, right?
---
So you would rather have to potentially burn a recon for every jump?
---
/u/sapporojones Reset LBFB when?
---
You are still as safe you were before, all it changed was the effort/costs to maintain your cyno chain. Pass those costs on to the customers, done. Or ask people to seed the cyno spots for you, if you are too lazy to do it.
---
Overall a very good change.
---
It is a GAME, there is no real physics in it....
---
It's a lot easier to kill pirate frigates in a Coercer than a Rifter.
---
To get the final blow on every single ship in the game with a combat fit Heron. I will settle for being on the kill mail tho
---
Recently started up my old accounts from over five years ago... Relearned to scan for anomalies and sites... came across an unfamiliar site, warped to 0m on a Triglavian pirate fleet with my t3 Proteus...I looked away at my tv for maybe 5 seconds while warping in before I noticed I was being swarmed and taking heavy incoming fire. Wasn't even ready for that shit at all and panicked to warp out and then RIP... Probably lost a bit in ship and parts within just 15 secs. I was like oh yeah...EvE...and remembered how cautious you need to be and a stupid mistake will cost you a lot here lol. I've lost tons of ships in the start years ago, but this was a slap in the face reminder and memory rejuvenator to all that though...
---
Lol I was on my phone, and it doesn't think squizz is a word so it autocorrected
---
see the trick is to never deploy anywhere outside direct range of jita
---
can always tell when he resubs an alt
---
Imagine being in tapi yickes haha
---
I was joking, this change is dumb, and anyone who doesn't think it is just unnecessary is also dumb.  Your solution is also dumb.
---
No, just let corvettes ceptors or w/e light industrial cynos, only JFs can jump to them.
---
eve is simply epek
---
All your stuff are belong to us..
---
Some hybrids (blasters) fire a ball of hot plasma whatever, which the lore says very quickly disintegrates in space. So a blaster hitting at target 50km away is basically hitting someone with little space flakes that do nothing.
---
Lasers are covered by others here. Same with missiles running out of fuel and just wandering off into the void.
---
Drones have a range after which their computers can't interact with the ship to take *new* commands, and eventually they lose all connection after a certain distance and stop operating.
---
Projectile turrets are the only ones that don't really make any sense. And railguns.
---
A pacifier, which is a scanning ship. I've made a route, and followed that. I usually only do relic sites. I just go though them one after one :D
---
The goal of the game is to acquire as many skins as possible and then sell them many years later at double the price, therefore getting the one that you bought for yourself for free.
---
Nah that award goes to Stainguy
---
I‚Äôll be honest; as an Alpha who can only get 5 million free SP, I‚Äôve had to specialize in one faction. I can fly and fit up to t1 destroyers/weapons from 3 of the factions, but Gallentte is the only one where I have t2 weapons and the like
---
...I also have no idea how to get a good income to fund my PvP losses... not that I, uh... lose almost every solo fight. Definitely not
---
These threads are far more damaging to player recruitment than anything CCP has done. A good portion of this sub needs to get a grip. It's pretty ridiculous.
---
I had two goals when I first joined Eve - start my own corp, and FC for a big nullsec alliance in some of those large battles I read about in PC gamer.
---
I haven't really managed the first goal yet, but I achieved the second and FC'd for GOTG/Dead Coalition. I made Strat FC level at about the time Asher was roflstomping us out of ROIR regularly. I got lots of great experience fighting against Goons and even though the war was pretty rough, I had fun and I learned a lot. I also got to FC in some of the biggest fights in the game including UALX and the jailbreak of PL's super fleet and also the subcaps for the X47 Keepstar fight.
---
Now I've just had my first kid, so I don't really have time to play like I used to and I've exchanged the FC cap for a Dad cap. My goal now is to just have fun with the little time I have to play video games.
---
Yep, L4s were my jam for a long time, got bored of it. If I‚Äôm in hisec my most exciting activity is either solo me vs triglavians (emerging conduit) or joining a big trig invasion fleet
---
So what you are saying is that there is some investment required now into the endgame of logistics in hostile territory? Say it ain't so!
---
Maybe you should reach out to the locals and see if you can arrange for them to supply you with cynos and ships.
---
Sad thing is logistics pilots were already in under heavy duty and burden but I need cheap and fast logistics to have fun with my toys.
---
Stressful job became more stressful so I pray our logistics pliots don‚Äôt quit. Thank you CCP!
---
are you stupid or retarded
---
Why do you think that JFing should be easy? Esp JFing through hostile territory.
---
Firstly you can thank your fellow nullbears for that, because they all cried so hard about the covert cyno thing that CCP changed it to this.
---
CCP have deliberately made it harder to jump freight across the whole cluster, so 'it made it harder to jump freight' isn't an argument they're going to engage with.
---
5k would make them frigate sized which seems rather small. 10k I could get behind.
---
You're delusional if you think CCP isn't the reason playercount has halved since 2014
---
How many people do you think even read this subreddit?
---
Though for now you can still anchor them and use them for a beachhead.
---
Wrecking shots would like a word
---
This was basically the sum of my comments on the topic last time it came up.
---
Ultimately, this is a return to the days of old when most cynos for JFs were done with t1 frigates. At the time, you couldn't fit enough LO in a rookie ship unless you had t1 expanders, or cyno V and were gallente raced (velator had the most cargo at the time).  
---
Locals sold them for dank profits in far off places.  So far, this hasn't developed completely with t1 industrials and indy cyno modules, but I have had decent luck getting hulls and cynos in random places here and there.  I'm hopeful that people recognize the economy is there - just look at the number of t1 industrials which die every day now which have a cyno fitted.
---
Are you really from push?
---
You are not reflecting the level of professionalism I have come to expect from them.
---
Eve physics aren't space physics. 'Submarines in space' is a meme for a reason.
---
Sometimes you get lucky. You hit a critical component, get that one-in-a-million good shot.

Newb here. Couldn‚Äôt you just fit a badger with a cloaky / MWD trick setup... use that to get through dangerous space and light the Indy Cyno?
---
I can't agree more with the character switch option without logging off.
---
There's an alternate route from jita entering at Hysera. It's like 10 more jumps but can be worth it to dodge the camp, especially if you are in a fast ship.
---
I don't like to start insulting people for their comments but this just doesn't make any sense. If thats what you took out of my comment then you should seriously reconsider where you stand on the whole cyno change.
---
Well the sub has 120,000 subscribed. This is the probably the most public community for Eve online. I see posts daily from players thinking about joining and have concerns due to the tone here. You don't think lurkers also see this horseshit when they decide to research a new potential game choice?
---
You're delusional if you think the absolute garbage spewed here has anything but a negative effect on retention and recruitment. I have no doubt it has real impact.
---
Yes. Has been a fun ride. And still is.
---
Didn't I hear something about not being able to Dock if you're currently being Scrammed? Was that a thing they did, or just a thing someone was talking about?
---
Combat Venture? already started... but still fighting in my Endurance.
---
We have not in panfam for the past year? 
---
Whats your point having to do with rampant botting in renter corps???
---
Not really. Many factors come into play... surprise (why the fuck an Endurance is shooting at me and I am half armor?) or rats helping or good range management... etc. And yes... many times luck. Many times new pilots.

"Yeah we're all Nazis, but it's all the Weimar Republic's fault"
---
Nah, you see the chaos era line of thinking with that is to make industry big.  Constructed cyno modules take up 3k m3 of cargo space.  That'll keep those pesky nullseccers from hauling them out of Jita en mass.

Okay dude, not sure what you'd prefer here. Eve-themed cakes like every other garbage gaming sub? "Daily discussion: which CCP dev is the most handsome"?

If you characterize all criticism as "absolute garbage" and "horseshit" then I don't know what to tell you. You seem to think that negativity is somehow intrinsically incorrect, which might just be the dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard.
---
this is what CCP Games wants you to do.
---
You‚Äôre better off keeping your missile skills then ripping them out but you might want to skill up turrets.
---
Don‚Äôt overthink doctrines and stuff, they change. I trained into t2 hml drakes and then they got nerfed. I trained into slowcats (for 8 months) and then they got nerfed.
---
So definitely don‚Äôt rip out skills to train to a doctrine you don‚Äôt even have.
