---
Keep thinking that...
---
---
---
Is there also a fix for the permanently cycling loading timer but nothing showing when you open people and places?
---
F's in chat boys
---
This is a dishonest scheme for the purpose of monetizing content generated by players that they already paid for by subscribing.
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Yes because unlike you I have a problem with them exploiting people with a addiction. If someone was spending hundreds to keep buying titan after titan to the point to where it is a addiction and ruining their life sure I'd have a problem with that. Though I haven't seen evidence for that.
---
Wut
---
Welcome back!
---
If you assign the same weight to all updates. Obviously this is incorrect.
---
No poors plz?
---
They should have a warning pop up every time you play that says "know your limit play within it" also a pop up everytime uve spent over x amount of isk and/or time gambling to remind you to to play wisely.
---
Ty kind sir
---
No fun allowed, think of the children.
---
  Better remove all risk everywhere because someone might become addicted/injured doing it. 
---
  Better shutdown all casinos and make all forms of gambling illegal- Shit better ban alcohol too because that kills people.
---
  When are we petitioning CCP to remove PLEX from the game?
---
Are you bragging on the internet about having lots of space money? 
---
Nut up or shut up, my man. Post a screenshot of you sending this dude 10bil.
---
Love your work, keep it up
---
3 minute warp timer?
---
Keep on fighting brother, a step at a time - for as long as there's a new tommorow there's a chance for something positive to happen to you. See you in back in New Eden when you're ready!
---
Warp away.
---
Many people, myself included, have also found that when opening people and places, you get a loading timer that never ends and you cannot see any bookmarks at all.
---
Except you don't need hypercores for the gambling part. You need them to setup raffle, and people setting up raffle stand to make shitton of isk from this
---
Not forever.  
---
  
---
3 min tops.  
---
Edit: also, get fucked.
---
Somer were not banned for being a gambling site.  
---
They were banned for RMT.
---
Out of town my dude. I have 0 need to prove anything to you. Fun fact tho, made my frost trillion isk in 2013. Market PvP is the best isk in the game.
---
and yet it doesn't with the bookmark limit per folder.
---
Able to share how the rewards work completing sites? Aside from the seemingly mediocre salvage
---
the amount of people you are screwing over is far less than the amount of people who will be gladdened to get cheaper Plex. You're making people glad, you fool ! Happy Thanksgiving 🙂
---
thats my bro o7
---
ah ok
---
just sayin u can save a lot on cap
---
slow golf clap....well played sir, well played
---
Do you mind elaborating a bit more on that point?
---
NP, I agree about abyssal stuff.
---
Eve celebrates holidays just not this one
---
Cot Sobad you're pretty transparent here
---
I wouldn't put it past these shitheads.
---
I mean, people seem to forget the entire last year before their acquisition, CCP spent all of their resources doing fuckall except artificially inflating login/sub numbers to fish for a buyout.  As bad as PA is, CCP had already turned to shitlords BEFORE the buyout.
---
1: Damage controls are in a separate stacking penalty group (along with reactive armor hardeners) from normal resistance modules. If you have one damage control and one ENAM, for example, neither is stacking penalized at all.
---
2: He's using the rapid repair charge in his command burst, not the resistance charge.
---
I HATE cars.  Do you have ANY IDEA how many people those terrible things have killed this year!?
---
This community's mindboggling inability to watch what CCP does, and not what they say, is the only reason this game is still alive at all.
---
Honestly, the only way they could even remotely make this as popular as SOMER, is to have a promo token equivalent.  That was the most fun part of SOMER; if you knew what you were doing you could actually make tons of isk because of the promo system.
---
Check out The Bleak Lands and Black Rise, you’ll find a lot of solo players and even get the outnumbered fights you’re after when you take someone’s bait. :D
---
No no. You're good. I just genuinely missed that sale. I still think their black Friday sale is weak but I am glad 5hat they at least did a sale on subs. We need people logging in. Happy thanks giving if your in the states!
---
Wasn’t that the country that was founded by ex America slaves who were freed and went back to Africa? Explains the thanksgiving.
---
What does that even mean? Jesus sometimes talking to you is like talking to a rock.
---
&gt;you must recognize that local chat = rmt since it allows thousands of bots to function.
---
oh you're one of those idiots that thinks botting stopped during the black out. got ya.
---
&gt;you can't say "wanting casino = wanting rmt", it's like saying "wanting spicy chicken wings = wanting hot asshole burning shits"
---
that's because i'm not saying it. i'm saying people placed more value on casino gambling than the impact of RMT. just the same as people placing the flavour of chicken wings above the discomfort of a buring arsehole.
---
&gt;i've never seen those items called "RMT items" in common parlance, but go ahead and find me some examples.
---
so, you've never spoken to a trader or browsed this subreddit? literally every item that's value is directly related to plex is in the 'rmt item' basket. you're demonstrating you don't know shit about what we're talking about right now.
---
&gt;ah, nevermind, glad you agree, since this is literally what i said.
---
no, you pretended it could only happen if ccp weren't invovled - which i have already explained is entirely false.
---
You failed to kill the FC :)
---
You don't bring ships over cruiser size into hostile SOV and expect to extract.
---
How was it illegal migration back then when there were no laws and borders yet, just tribal rules at most? Dont go full minmatar.

Some idiot lost tackle on it he's been reprimanded might get kicked...

The FC either goes down with his fleet, or dies warping it out to safety.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
A shameful display to have an FC return without his fleet and with his tail between his leg.
---
the video was good. i'm not sure all the gloating is warranted tho considering you reshipped to a super hard counter (ab only kiki vs feroxes) and all u did was anchor/orbit 1000 or something. you look equally bad for talking shit imo.
---
If Eve went away I'd have to go back to Factorio
---
How tall is he on average?
---
You said: fix the problems, that is balancing, that is changing two numbers.
---
But when it comes to other updates, then there is still the new trig stuff. Mostly highsec/lowsec but those areas didn't get a lot of attention for a while, so that is actually good.
---
BM = bowel movement
---
i see, you don't even want to see different arguments. So, i guess we can stop and start calling CCP out as being shit again...
---
The drifter battleship seems to be a cheater and gets wrecking shots FAR more often than it should.  Its supposed to be 1%, but I seem to see it more like 10-15% of his hits; the only option is to overtank or not get hit at all.  I've even had back to back wrecking blows relatively often which should be incredibly rare.
---
Is the bpc a drop or lp or how does that part work
---
&gt;as long as it incentivizes people to sell their uber rare ships I’ll be a happy camper.
---
spoiler: it won't.
---
In two words? Pearl Abyss.
---
Correct, meme.
---
There is a Plex sale! Go get some more :)
---
the abyssal mod discord is also happy.
---
Bastard tanked 37k damage in a Stiletto. Who does that?
---
Not sure if it's still like this but we used to have some crazy dudes up in tribute 4 or 5 years ago who would go full berserk with a booster claymore and full snake barghests and machs. Some dude formed 50 arty canes against them but they were still faster than the canes. Not sure if we ever got one of them. They were choke point or project mayhem if I remember correctly
---
I foreseen that ccp will move to Asian playerbase cause is more profitable. They already doing that with Korean localization.. They will move further. As you see pearl abyss is in control now even if they said will not touch eve.
---
My smallest order was two modules for 10m^3, 5mil reward for 2,5bil collateral.
---
Could have flown it out myself in a Taxi(align Interceptor) but didn't want to risk loosing it. If the hauler blows up I at least get the collateral and can buy the same modules again to get them delivered once more.
---
Usually Haulers don't get blown up ... if you're part of a bigger corp / know your shit that is.
---
People would just buy plex?
---
Think about what you haven't done back then and do just that.

10mn afterburner which is too big for a destroyer. This way you can get under the clone soldier's guns even when they web you.

It's about time someone had the balls to take down all those fat-cats in iceland! Some of these people are making $10s or even $12s of dollars an hour! How are Mom-and-Pop outfits like Ubisoft and EA Games supposed to compete a corporate Behemoth like CCP?!?!?!

Most people forgot about everything about Subcap-Engagements (or never learned it) since FarmVille EVE hit the servers

Arent emerging conduits done as the triglavians have emerged?
---
Good, If there had been a deal on omega I might have thrown 4 x 3 months subs CCP's way this month. Instead I can go with plan B and buy a nice ride cymbal.
---
What's the reward from doing these?
---
&gt; no one refers to RMT as the legitimate purchasing of PLEX/subscription from CCP except for you.
---
even i'm not.
---
purchsing plex isn't rmt, exchanging in-game items for irl currency is.
---
If "newswork" is part of your new job, I can see you excel at it.

Congrats on the job, thanks for your work with NER.

What can I say except, delete this.

How do you slip through a camp on a Heron? I'm not Korean, but also new ;)
---
There's no honor in EvE
---
Sweeping generalization after sweeping generalization.
---
I'm sure not "all" of us were happy with it when third parties were doing it.
---
I put up with it when third parties were doing it.
---
When CCP removed gambling it was good, it was sad that it hurt the AT, but ultimately EvE didn't need gambling.
---
CCP have now reintroduced gambling after years in a way that lines there pockets, and then in had the audacity to advertise it as wealth redistribution, the reality is they've added a functional way for people to gamble, addicts or not, whilst not redistributing jack. If you're running a raffle you're running it for profit, not the goodness of your heart to share the wealth.
---
Then you have the sheer hilarity of the fact that if the lottery doesn't sell all of its tickets inside of 3 days, CCP takes all your CCPBUX and you get utterly jack shit for having payed CCP.
---
I'm calling it now, the average use of this won't be players setting up random raffles, it'll be somer blink mk2, with most the raffles being created by one entity that advertises there creation via an out of game service. And offers services like head to head betting against people, etc. "Oh you want to bet 25b? Well here's the titan hull, this guy also wants to bet 25b, so we'll add our 2b charge, titans up for 50b, each of you buy half the tickets for 52b total".
---
It's straight up gambling and I genuinely hope CCP falls afoul of anti-gambling regulations.
---
Unless y'know they want to implement opt-outs, self exclusion, deposit limits, reality checks, and all the other hoops that companies that actually run gambling have to jump through.
---
Why is that list not broken down by hull class, or faction or anything to clean it up a bit.
---
&gt; You can be totally for casinos, but still not be okay with third parties using it to RMT, which is exactly what I've stated 4-5 times
---
Yes, but I guess point being is that feeling okay or not okay about something only matters when it translates into tangible actions. Being line customers, the most people could do it to request devs for stuff, and they (those who did so, obviously) used the full extent of their ability, such as it is, to take *pro* position in regard to something that happen to enable one of possible RMT venues, which I guess was seen by them as someone else's problem. Granted, it's very debatable if those voices actually translates into anything that matters at all.
---
&gt; please don't argue for the actual retard who believe the above posts
---
Considering the debate won't affect anything and as such is being held for the sake of entertainment, basically, I don't see a problem with participating in it in whatever quality.
---
You make Sort look Handsome.
---
I actually bought 50 to learn hahahaha.
---
A market requires a Fortizar, Azbel or higher. You will be paying hundreds of millions in fuel per month, so unless you forsee making yourself a very busy trade hub, it's not a money maker.
---
And if you do become busy, you will likely get a visit from those who do not want a new market competing with theirs.

I'll look for one c3 with HS I think

Hey my dude welcome to Eve! Rather than retype i'll just provide you with 2 really handy links:

---
 [https://kryptedgaming.com/category/eve-online-basics/](https://kryptedgaming.com/category/eve-online-basics/) 
---
Top link answers your question, second link has some really handy guides that helped me get into the right mindset. (plus the author is a really cool dude that's very helpful).
---
If you have any specific questions though im willing to help! Also only about 4months into the game myself which is very new by eve standards.
---
Fly safe... or dangerous.. whichever you prefer o7
---
:C sad for me
---
The difference between buying a second raffle ticket and a second lottery ticket is extremely significant as far as odds go.
---
If you're in a 512 ticket raffle or participating in a state lottery, buying a second ticket in both instances increases your raffle win chance from 0.19% to 0.39% and your lottery win chance from 0.0000000000057% (5.7*10^-9) to 0.0000000011% (1.14*10^-8).
---
Buying a second lottery ticket is almost meaningless but buying a second raffle ticket makes a sizable uptick in your win percentage.
---
Sure, either you "win or you don't" but that's not really how the universe works, especially when you repeat this over more than one instance. Winning a raffle is vastly easier than winning the lottery, because while buying a lottery ticket guarantees you a seat at the table for the prize, even if 175 million people bought lottery tickets (with the odds being 175m:1, same odds used for the previous example) there's no guarantee one of the entrants wins.

Fwaming Dwagons

---
No. It doesn't happen that way, Mittani ask CCP to ban casino because it was bad for people having gaming issue, CCP never answer, Reddit laughed... Mittani then announce he was working on a casino of his own since "If Panfam have their own, we will have our own" but CCP ban Casino before it ever was released.
---
Now the out of the OP topic : he lost the north and blamed the funding of the war (like any major alliance has isk problems) without actually any big fight happening and shit being srp'ed.
---
That is all wrong too, here is some fact so you understand what really happen (like really, did you fight in this war or are you just retarded ?) 54 alliance vs 12, 1 alliance backstab the 12, a few like razor/fcon/sma died in the process, SRP war chest of Goons stolen before the war, A lot of corp left to join the other side, IWI/Eve-bet fully SRP any titan/super lost during the war, IWI was the official founder of WWB (you can track Lenny_Kravitz2 post). With this list I hope you understand why Goons never took any supercap fight, the only time they almost did it was during M-O when Co2 backstab them, (sadly) Mittani saw it coming and ask to not drop their supercap that was in range, a few hours later he would know that it was a trap.. Why from a leader perspective, Mittani had the best idea in the world to turtle in saranen and never fully commit ? Well I'm too lazy to link X47 battlereport or the latest MER, but ask yourself how Goons become the biggest supercap fleet 4 year after bleeding during a war against 54 alliance where they lost so many thing. From what you say you never played during WWB or you are bias AF.
---
Yes the first one lead to RMT a
---
I should clarify with / I ment the type of c2. C2's each have duel statics so you can have a c3 static with a hs making it good for farming and selling loot.
---
If your less active a C3 with a highsec static would be good as a mini farmhole. I would also make alpha scanner alts to throw in there incase you get rolled out.
---
Thanks, I always struggle with dotlan, I know about checking jumps and NPC delta and the like.
---
Sergaljerk was recruiting
---
I play with trigger happy, I have fun on my doorstep everyday, pvp all around the place. Before that I was in WH, I was rolling my static and bob know what was behind. Yeah if you live in a superbloc you will never get pvp, fuck them, get yourself in a medium scale alliance
---
Yeah it's easy to drop a super and kill a ship. It takes skill to kite and keep your self alive in a fight / plane where your out gunned an out numbered.
---
aar: Land in local and dreads have safed  on a Raitaru f. Land on zero of Feroxes and co after our Confessor probed them. Scram Monitor with the Stiletto and make quick work of everything else.
---
All shit talk aside GF. At any moment all of the Feroxes could have broken anchor pulled range and maybe actually hit the Kikis. One did and that's how I ended up losing the Stiletto and the Monitor kill.
---
Also side note most of comms consisted of us giggling at one of our members who was drunk and high off his ass being a complete fool. You can see him burn way off behind to kill the lonely Ferox with a brain, who pulled range and shit on my Stiletto. Same dude who told us to run and hide before we get hurt...
---
Ayy chief, just open ya jaw somemaw and you'll look like one-a-them soy boys!
---
&gt; "Yeah, there was some tax deductions in the game I play ~~to have fun~~."
---
FTFY
---
Your income on it would be directly proportional to the amount of nodes that you allow to be taken by other players, the more you allow to fill, the higher the risk is that you lose the item, and only receive payment for the amount nodes you sold to others.
---
You'd literally just be gambling, against yourself.
---
TBH at this point why not, not like CCP will ever change anything that would clash alliances/coalitions with each other on a large scale...
---
If you price it too highly then people don't buy the nodes, and you lose your hypercores with no payout.
---
We're waiting....
---
Should've done that first before changing the Sotiyo container to be Freighter sized...
---
Is in gambling against yourself?  If your alt loses the gamble, your main has still sold the item and is still making all the isk. But if you buy half your own nodes to have a 50/50 shot at getting your item back AND profiting off the other half of purchased nodes, I can see this being an extremely profitable scam, depending on core pricing and taxes.
---
What's the difference between 40m in implants and a 40m ship? Whether or not there are implants in the game doesn't fix the brains of those that risk averse.
---
Guess we’ll have to do the math, but if I can task $ turn it into relays that I have a 50% chance of winning my own item back on, it can be extremely profitable.

Isn't the dread already shit after the recent 60% nerf to damage and is now barely better than an average Nag?
---
This guy looks like he regularly travels to Japan to buy women's panties from vending machines.
---
Train into a Nestor and join a wormhole corp.
---
Definitely, but if you can cycle an item just once or twice on average, you can still pull profit off the scam.
---
Hey guys, keep it up, your vids are really inspiring and making me log although I am a quite bitter vet. After 12 years of doing close to everything in k-space my corp moved to WH space lately too. 
---
We are scared of diving too deep in atm ;-P, so we started with a C2 NSS lately.
---
He did.
---
You can allways drop Supers in your own space lol.
---
If not why were you not evicted earlier? In your own space where you have your deathclone and several hulls to reship into you can allways keep fighting.
---
Hostiles cannot, not in &lt;current year&gt; stay in your SOV for any lenght of time. They would get dropped to shit, Nyxes love themselfes some Battleships and a even a Hel with their shitty application can track a target that big.
---
I'm semi-AFK mining with two accounts while playing Poker in VR, so this should work for you:
---
Set to windowed mode and split your screen between two clients.  If you don't have the monitor resolution for this, obtain another monitor.
---
Bind the new "Open Location" shortcut to something nearby but unused, like ` next to 1.  Practice warping to bookmarks by holding ` and right-clicking.
---
Rename your safe bookmark with ``` at the beginning so it's at the top of your list.
---
In your mining barges, equip a Higgs rig.  This will slow you down a ton, but it means you can always be aligned to a target (like, for example, your safe spot) and not move out of range of your asteroid.
---
Set up an overview tab for "combat": ships only (NPC and player).  Switch to this tab after you've targeted an asteroid.
---
The moment you see 3 to 4 Trig ships pop up in your overview from the corner of your eye (you won't miss it now with the split screen and the overview), hold `, right click, and select your ```-named safe.  You will immediately warp because you were aligned in your barge with the Higgs rig.
---
You can use these exact same skills to avoid suicide gankers.
---
You would be surprised how retarded people are, I know someone who pulled it off quite a few times.
---
Or some skins
---
All those things are everywhere but are for adults not a 14 year teenager.
---
Comparing your vids to our last Nullsec experiences I cannot deny
---
&gt; if you have already covered the cost of the item, buying any remaining ticket forces the sale to end, and provides the chance to repeat the sale.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; it's free money.
---
If you just let the time end without filling the nodes yourself you get the item back anyway, and are only out the cost of cores, and can just relist it for a better lower price with a higher chance of filling. If you buy up any of the nodes, all you do is increase your own risk by reducing the total payout you will receive should the item go to someone else.
---
Thank you!!!!
---
Oh man! You are setting yourself up for a ass kicking.... you need to get a headset/mic and join an active Corp Asap. Take a break for a day or two and fly a cheap pvp frigate to learn some pvp mechanics and about high sec ganking and also hunting. You will lose everything you have worked for and you will be pissed. Trust me. Go join an active new bro friendly Corp and learn as much as you can. It’s a great way to also get some free skill books and learn the game. Tell people you are new and ask in hell channels. People will help you learn the game and many of the mechanics that will benefit you. Even something as simple as mining with “links” can double your ore output.
---
You are aware that anyone participating in the Hpyernet can SEE who is the holder of each node?
---
Calling Slyce 'core' nullsec players, priceless
---
Well...using my garbage fit and getting run off the field...probably about 15mins to clear. Then how ever long it takes you to loot and salvage. I have begun supporting myself with reps and that probably  shaves 5 mins or so. 
---
Imho it's good money for solo highsec players. And if you happen to not be rich and run 3 accounts you can still finish the site and have as good time.
---
I mainly posted this fit for those blue collar eve players who can't afford to drop half a billion to have a good time.

If anyone is having trouble with the sites I will fly logi for ya.....if you are willing to come to gal space. We are recruiting.

---
This part just made me laugh SO HARD.
---
&gt; You just promoted that not being in front of your computer is a viable way to play a game 
---
I never said that, did you went to school as a kid? You might me missing some abilites to interpret written stuff.
---
&gt; You also claim null is pure pvp space 
---
I said you are trying to farm in a place where PVP is fully open, how is the place where PVP is not penalized by any means called? PVE space? Again you are missing some important basic abilities they teach in school.
---
&gt; You are also claiming someone that hates afk cloakers should leave null 
---
If you can't deal with the possibilitie of being engaged at any moment, nor find strategies to not die when that happen, you should **REALLY** think to yourself if you are in the right place.
---
You are just a **newbie** that think that knows how to play the game just becaus you fly expensive ships.

Stop embarassing yourself.

"NetEase paired up with CCP Games to develop this game. Thus, we can assume that the game will have plenty of in-app purchases."

What a nice way to say "Pay-to-win", NetEase is notorious for that.

---
Don't worry, in 2004 they released the contract system with the promise that it would be iterated on at later date... so knowing ccps track record I would expect to see some changes within the next 3 years or so
---
You can keep at range to rocks. E is the default hotkey for it, hold E and click the rock. Your ship will keep at your set range.
---
If you are moving in the opposite direction, it takes you time to slow down, turn around and align, making it up to 4 seconds. Plus your reaction time. Not a huge difference perhaps, really only matters if a bomber decloaks next to you, but still.
---
Press q move mouse, left click, move mouse, left click. Have fun.
---
What does a correctly fit ship entail?
---
It's a bit complicated. Let's say that as a rule both militias don't really care about flipping systems because 1/ Citadels made system control irrelevant 2/ I-Hub bash is boring and not rewarding 3/ you don't even get a medal for warzone control. This trend has existed for a long time.
---
In the Amarr/Minmatar warzone all the fights are in Sosala, Starkman and RP wise in Floseswin. Because all 3 are "Treaty" systems.
---
So yep the treaty is holding and there is a paradox here because some Amarr entities turned traitors to the treaty for easy content. Since betraying the treaty means your members will have 24/7 content fighting the alliances respecting and enforcing the treaty. Including content thanks to an Amarr civil war.
---
The paradox is that those turncoats renegade to their word exploit the fact that the treaty gives to those systems an importance, a role they haven't had for a long time. So if everybody drop the treaty, the value of those systems will disappear and motivation/content will be back to zero.
---
Classic freeloader scenario : I don't pay my bus ticket but the day the bus company goes bankrupt I won't be able to take the bus. But interestingly it does increase content as long as the treaty holds and give those systems a value.
---
TLDR : some systems are vulnerable but pvpers are focused elsewhere.

I think you are on the right track but I'd change it up a bit, the number of top level folders should be more generic like you said and that should solve issue #1 (if you click on NPCs for example, just show all NPCs).  Additionally with the new NPCs that can be friendly or hostile depending on your state with them having states for hostile vs. neutral/ally NPCs would be really useful.

I can say I am Gallente

I see the drake, I upvote
---
Must be a trendy topic
---
That kinda thinking gave us a nested locations folder for bookmarks XD
---
Yep
---
Finally finished one of my earlier 3D projects. Paint quality isn't the best, but I definitely learned lots to help with the next one!
---
Everything is 1":100m scaled.

Yeah I've been playing for a while but my Omega ran out about a month ago
---
But did they avoid the IRL ISK doubling scammers this time?
---
What would you recomend as a salvage destroyer
---
The little kestrell is the cutest thing i've seen today! Ty OP!

He was not a first time FC lol
---
I want the astero.
---
u/ohosometal do you do custom orders at all??
---
Okay, now it makes sense. Though how much isk "left behind" per hour doesn't equal to how much isk you can salvage per hour. I was wondering how long it takes to salvage one site. A noctis clears a site much faster so you have to take that into account.

A legacy/campaign miniatures game where 4 plucky capsuleers in [your favorite sub-cap] try to make their mark while fighting off empires, rogue drones, and sleepy boos.
---
Yeah mostly except for the ITC, this is the text from the announcement.
---
&gt;New Gameplay: Interstellar Trading Center
---
To satisfy the increasing demand for business, a new trading platform “Interstellar Trading Center (ITC)” open to all Capsuleers! All ITCs are connected in one single network, which means you can view every most recent trading orders among New Eden while sitting in an ITC.
---
I dont know if this is gonna be something like if you can see the orders but you still have to go to the location or if you buy it and it transports it across the galaxy we'll have to see
---
Why spend extra time on one thing to finish it when they can half-ass multiple things so they can claim they are doing a lot.
---
Then you clearly have no idea how to kite.
---
I love that I recognized this without seeing the subreddit it's posted on.
---
I only need one for Guristas.
---
It's an ever returning discussion. If Eve would make millions off it they would already done it. But Eve merchandise, or any game's merchandise for that matter, is simply not as profitable as it seems to be in the eyes of the hardcore follower.
---
Love the name bud, keep it up ledbirds
---
CODE is one of the best things about this game. 
---
James is a great comic character, and minerbumping.com a consistently good read. 
---
I love the Catch-22 arguments and the sincerity with which CODE agents articulate them. Such great fun.
---
I got excited when google said I have early access but the servers aren't up yet.
---
I agree, the blog is awesome, and so is the SRP for all gank ships. James 315 is always a,fun guy too
---
oh no they might know that i spend money on **THINGS** and **SERVICES***
