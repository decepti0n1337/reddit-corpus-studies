Depends on their culture(s), which we don't know much about. Cultures exist in other science fiction that respect demonstration of force more than they respect peaceful interaction. Klingons and The Covenant come to mind. Triglavians could be similar. They have dedicated proving grounds for a reason, after all.

They caught the guy burning to join our small gang. Then tried to camp us in a system where we were entosising an iHub. The other 1/3 of their fleet warped in like normal people, but 20 or 30 of them were warping and firing like that old goon guy, ooddell or whatever his name was. Also reminded me of the nightmares the guy used to multibox in incursions.

This comment is the exact opposite of what will come. Shield supers have already proven their dominance, with shield slaves it's only going to far surpass  armor.

Type the region name into zkill and it will bring up kill stats by corp and alliance.

My first hand experiance mainly in black rise is that there is good small gang and some solo during peak EU and US tz evenings. In off hours it is generally slow.

As far as I can tell, Azdaja are the Sleepers (Ancient Enemy), Automata are the rogue drone colonies, and Narodyna are humanity as a whole. Corrupted Narodyna are the cyborg Sansha slaves (taken from above comment). 
---
Moon ore isn't freaking compressable

---
cargo fitted   avatar can store 2 forts?
---
Now look at the dual tanked nyx
---
Azdaja seems to refer to Sansha Kuvakei and his borg-like process of enslavement. It's a Turkish word meaning "Dragon".
---
Automata refers to autonomous drones of all kinds, but especially rogue drones.
---
Narodyna appears to refer to infomorphs piloting vessels in general. Corrupted Narodyna means Drifters, Human Augmented Narodyna means Capsuleers.
---
Isn't it also somewhat fitting that the Convocation of Triglav Outside the Struggle: Svarog, Perun and Veles represent Fighter, Researcher/Leader, Builder/Industrials.
---
Those could represent *bloodlines* in the same way that amarr have things like True Amarr, Khanid and Ni Kunni in character creator. Not that I think we'd ever get to make new triglavian capsuleers.
---
Nationalism for China is good. Nationalism for India, Mexico, Israel, Japan and African countries is good. Nationalism for European countries is evil and anyone who thinks otherwise must be a neo nazi supremacist.

Dude stop
---
I hope they swap my slave set out for the new armor set then...
---
Correct. Sansha ships are shield tanked, so it has never really made sense the Sansha would have the Armor HP implants. Blood Raiders makes far more sense.
---
As far as why this has taken so long, the nature of Shield recharge made these implants far more tricky to impliment than the straight-forward armor HP buff.

CCP announced they are going to look at shield extenders when shield slaves come.
---
And if the rep changes come into effect then armor will be stronger as you can get pretty beefy shield reps before going into your armour buffer.

Ofc the extender rework is based on speculation, ccp isnt known for being good at balance.

&gt;As a culture, the Triglavians seem to be deeply ritualistic and tradition-based, with numerous RL concepts worked into their operations. Sobornost and Poshlost are two often-heard terms in their lexicon, denoting being-in-cooperation and being-a-vulgarity/obscenity, respectively. Cladistic/Anti-Cladistic “Glorification” and “Mortification”, metaxy, evocation, noema as a term for policy, and communion as interaction are all examples of the somewhat disorienting (but comprehensible) Triglavian syntax. The noema of “Proving” is also widespread within their operations, being a sort of trial by combat as testing - something capsuleers may also be taking a part in, unintentionally. These terms will be defined and explained in more detail further below.
---
From [this website](https://www.alpha-orbital.com/news/the-complete-lore-of-the-triglavian-collective) which compiles some shit on them. Svarog Clade may have outright exterminated one of their rival clades in cladistic proving. Also because gameplay and lore are different it cant quite be determined just how many triglavians we've actually "killed", and just how okay they are with it.
---
I just want the old map in a window like the new map is.

No, they don't "affect" the game in any way barring making me search for 1-2 seconds longer for any service I want. But holy shit is that delay *every single time* infuriating.

This actually sounds really really interesting
---
The first tier P4s convert 75m³ to 100m³, which is a 33% volume increase. The other two reduce in volume by ~50% and ~70%.
---
The guy input broadcasted all the character creations, all his kills have the exact same guys always in the same ships, firing at the same time.
---
And note how they aren't being endorsed by Democratic leaders the way Trump officially endorsed Roy Moore. :-)

Nor are Democrats crying "fake news!!" or "false flag!!" or to try and protect "their people". They're instead disowning them like the shit humans they are. Maybe your side should learn how to do that.

Tip
---
Separate Extraction planets and make Production planets on Barrens (use 1-2 toons for production only and they can load the planets at the same time)
---
Max out your Extration, set for 4 days &lt;--- Important
---
reset every 2 days &lt;----- very important
---
when setting the extractors make sure you get nice high peaks at the start, as this will mine more in the first two day  
---
Get it?
---
have your extractor toons make P1s on every planet Base Metals 
---
 &gt; Reactive  and the others the other component say Heavy Metals &gt; Toxic
---
this way you cans send them all (if you have more than 1 account) for pick ups all at the same time saving time
---
Your Production Toons load the two P1s into their factories and make blocks in non stop for every in 20 factories per planet with 2 lunch pads each holding a different P1 (I only use 10 PI Toons 5 of which only run 3 planets while the others do 5-6 planets)
---
my 2 Production Toons have 3 of these planets each churning nonstop 20x6 which is 120 5 C. Blocks per hour which is about 172m a day for about 5 bill a month depending on prices

---
Looks like it's not the double gun model that was teased though. Somewhat sad about that.
---
Uhhh those numbers aren't quite right.
---
The "first tier" P4s (nano-factories, organic mortar applicators) take 87.2 m3 of P3 and convert it to 100 m3 (approx 15% increase in volume)
---
The other P4s take 108 m3 of P3 (e.g. Wetware mainframes) and convert it to 100 m3 of P4, so approx a 7.4% reduction in volume.
---
I wonder if my existing armor slave implants will get renamed into Amulets or one day be shield slaves, instead. I believe I would prefer the former.
---
I see not a single sign of input broadcasting in his character portraits. There are enough differences in them to suggest that these were all done individually. This guy could very well just be one of those über-autistic multiboxers with multiple monitors and a good APM.
---
Well, save it and share it if it's useful. It is also (better formatted) on the FEDUP wiki. You could always join.... :-P
---
You sounding like an alpha day in day out
---
I too felt like the broadcast was more of an announcement of their intentions than a general declaration of war. The proving grounds feature heavily in the broadcast. I think it would be neat if (and I half suspect that) the proving grounds will end up being key to acquiring the new T2 Triglavian ships (via special datacores, probably), that unlike the Zarmazd - which was developed through Imperial research into Triglavian tech - will be developed by Triglavians themselves (lore wise).

This seems largely correct to me, except for one detail: Aren't the Corrupted Narodnya the Sansha and the Ancient Enemy Azjada the Sleepers?

Narodnya seems to be, broadly, used as 'humanity' and the Sansha are a lot of things, but ancient isn't one them.

&gt;they all have the hoody sweatshirt team

I mean, the same implant chart they showed 4 years ago and a couple more trig ships that we knew were coming are OK, but nothing really newsworthy for a Fanfest type event.

This distancei is relevant to jump drives though.

Rags always been the best titan ingame, ccp just didn't know till now
---
Are azdaja not sleepers?
---
Doesn't really work that way.  Current shield fleets WITHOUT implants are on par with armor fleets WITH implants.  If they release these without heavily nerfing base shields, there will be no reason to ever fly armor supers again.

---
The Drifters are the children of the Sleepers, and Sleeper Drones would fall under Automata (deviant or otherwise). Sansha is the one who has been exploiting a wormhole of unknown provenance for an age and a half, I suspect he's their great enemy.
---
Under these mechanics titans and supers could be better, butgj getting out there flat out ban t2 drones in general and thus already be five years in.

---
Such heresy
---
thanks bud.  we all make mistakes.
---
&gt; We have already adapted their ship designs to fit our controls and modules, and we now fly their ships even better than they do.
---
We can fly drifter ships?
---
Yeah I really wanted to avoid the "haul every day" scenario as that is not what I would call low or medium effort. Hence the P1 to P2 on the same planet as the extractors (and I am willing to take that hit in efficiency). If people are willing to put in the extra work to just do extraction/P1 on one planet and then move to a factory, I encourage them to do that! However, that seems like a lot to me. 
---
I'll be honest, I didn't 100% understand all the things you were trying to get across, but my pickups are all at the same time. I fly my toons around, pick up all my T2 (and occasional T1) stuff, deliver it to the dudes with the factory planets, import, and I'm good to go for another 3-4 days (except for daily extractor resets).
---
I do not think that setting the extraction for 4 days and then restarting actually gains you anything over setting it to 2 days. Yeah, the peaks are sharper, but that's because there is *more* dropoff, I think. I experimented a while back between setting 24 hour runs and restarting them morning *and* evening (so they only ran about 12 hours) and I noticed no difference between just setting them for 12-hour jobs. The one advantage about your method of long sets and then resets is that if you forget to reset, it will keep running (not at maximum efficiency, but it will keep extracting). 
---
This comment confuses me.

I dont think they even refer to eachother as triglavian, probably just "triglav"

We will all be Triglavian, with a default citizenship rank of civilian. Those who wish may enter the Proving Grounds to achieve higher rank. 
---
The Abyssal Strands are gates to the Proving Grounds. 
---
Running Abyssal Sites is gaining rank as a Triglavian. 
---
Once you prove you are better than all the NPC Triglavians, the only Triglavians you can gain rank on is other Players. 
---
Now imagine the Triglavians worked really hard at making a super weapon, like a dread, or a carrier, or a Titan, or something new... which Triglavian do they give it to? 
---
Not quite. Triglavian Collective is a joining of the three clades. Triglav itself representing a fusion of the three in Slavic Lore. Zorya is a pair of Guardian Goddesses that watch over the apocalypse beast (Simargl I think) who is chained to the star Polaris. They (there are two) are also (in Slavic Lore at least) are responsible for opening and closing the gates of the sun.
---
My theory is the triglavian people are either different races, or different castes. If they are different races it might explain their recruitment drive. Lol
---
A HAW weapon is suppose to be just a bunch of BS weapons on a single weapons hardpoint. I'm not certain how that give HAW weapons better range then BS weapons though.

Well, P0-P2 planets, in-system on 8 day cycles, on a shit planet, make roughly 40m per month minimum.  This takes ~60s per planet per week, plus about 2 min of hauling per planet (if in system).  This is 40m per 6 min, or 400m/hour.
---
And have every person in that fleet spend 5b+ on implants that have a high chance of being lost if your ship dies... Hmmmmm. Possible? Sure, Practical? Not a fucking chance.

---
&gt;Ancient Enemy Azdaja are the drifters/sleepers and Corrupted Narodyna are the cyborg slaves of sanshas nation.
---
I'd buy either way on this honestly. Because the term 'corrupted' comes up a lot in reference to the Drifters, and the Drifters do use the bodies of capsuleers to make new forms for themselves; whereas Sansha hasn't really seen as much interaction with the Triglavians. That said though the Drifters have been out there for a \*lot\* longer than Sansha has...

FYI: Planetology and Adv Planetology are useless.  The default resolution is enough for a baseline.  Then you can check your yield to the unit accuracy by installing the Extractor Head, then checking their yield.  The estimate is always wrong, but the installed numbers are correct.
---
The planetology skills also do nothing to determine how long a hotspot will last, and are thus 90% wasted SP.

Because nothing says inclusive like excluding people that you don't like farms and fields?

We appreciate that you immediately prove his point.
---
You know you can set up your clients with isboxer so that you literally can lock and f1 like 20 accounts in 5 secs right?
---
This all what my belief, however the recruitment video shows the face of Arythmos Tyrannos while saying "the ancient enemy Azdaja", then shows Nightmares and the face of Sansha Kuvakei while saying "the corrupted narodyna". Which would indicate those two name associations (which originally wrote backwards).
---
Ok, so three things in response to this: The installed numbers are always correct, yes, but...
---
1. There is a limit placed on how many times you can stop/restart your extractor within a given period of time (I think you have to wait 10-15 seconds between after your second reset without submitting) to prevent your doing exactly what you described. If you hit "Submit," then you have to wait a minimum of 60 seconds before it can be reset. I really hated having the planetary interface tell me I wasn't allowed to do things yet when all I wanted to do was set my stuff in the morning and go to work. XD
---
2. Doing so adds an additional unnecessary step to an already semi-complicated process for beginners.
---
3. The overall investment for Planetology 4 and Adv Planetology 3 is under 180k SP, so you can train them in about three days with a half-decent stat array and/or training implants, thus getting good estimates without having to re-click your extractors, check them, re-set, them, and repeat the process multiple times.
---
Together, I think this presents a decently firm case for training them up, and why I presented them as a "may as well do this" in a guide for beginners. It is very little SP investment for something that (while yes, only giving you an estimate) will still save you a chunk of time in the long run. Saving 1-2 minutes each time you have to set up an extractor adds up pretty darn quickly if you set 30-ish extractors every day (i.e. two per planet for 15 planets). As always, I do not claim that this is the *only* way to do PI, just that it is what works for me.
---
My pet peeve is the goofuses who claim there's no wrong way to play EVE.
---
Welcome! Get out while you can. But if you choose to stay, play a little bit in hi-sec, then try joining one of the newbie corps- Pandemic Horde, Brave, Karmafleet (grrr goons)   or Eve-uni. They can help you learn the ropes. Most will give you free ships and skill books as well. Fly safe.

Ah. Right subjects, wrong order. Yeah, Sansha Pilots would be "Corrupted Narodyna" as well. It does make more sense that Sleepers/Drifters/The Other are the Great Enemy.

tyvm, I am asking because I kept mine on in this particular scenario but set too close a range and it severely broke my orbit, allowing him to get some nice hits on me even at such a close range.

No wormholes or PVE confessors concerned in this scenario. A long time ago when I was newer I was killed by an astero while I was piloting a confessor. Recently I had a chance to play the other side of that battle in an astero, but I failed pretty hard because I kept my MWD on and set my orbit way too close to him.

Indeed. Just doing P0 - P1 - P2 planets increases the total amount of PI you can extract and decreases the logistics of boating stuff around and the taxes you have to spend importing/exporting things. However, I wanted to present the creation of P3/P4 using this method for those who have those as specific objectives in mind.

They are recruiting because too have too few numbers themselves to fly their capital ships. One capsuleer can command an entire capital ship and you only need the minimum crew. Hence, they are recruiting. It is also 3 am.

This problem started with Citadel. When you enter a system with a lot of structures, the overview lags and the logic that would normally select the next gate times out.

Reference to [this](https://youtu.be/Yj8mdaKUw3U) by Vily of TEST. Faggot isn't hate speech. And it doesn't imply fear of homosexuals. It's used here as a generic term of disparagement, apparently toward someone who dropped caps on a target that didn't deserve it.
---
Right? The best is simple farmers flair. Everyone hates you by default 
---
Or not saying a word hurts their friends?
---
Instead of giving it away, gate it to Jita and sell it. Use the proceeds to then buy another Hel and do the same. Infinite money trick. 
---
Well how about that!
---
It's admirable just how much butthurt your alliance has sown over the years. Even after they progress to nullsec the tears keep flowing. Please don't ever change.

The best part is that Boat's reaction is like "Wait can we say this?", while the Mittani is laughing his ass off.
---
&gt;Nigger isn't hate speech, and doesn't imply fear of black people. Its used as a general term of disparagement. 
---
Ignoring the historical context of a word is stupid.  I don't think its the worst thing in the world he used it, but your argument is dumb.

I actually can't ask anyone because I am without a PC for a couple weeks. I say yes, but only if you or the pilot winning agrees to use it against us when we inevitably clash in a big war.

Please explain this comment.

Well, I think it could have up to 3 of them, since all Trig stuff is in 3s. But who knows how many it will actually come with.
---
Im pretty sure some gay people would believe that of the word faggot. 
---
For T4s I just use 5% turret ROF, turret tracking, and the cap implants. For T5s add to that some mid grade asklepians, no need whole set. But I also use boosters on top of that, so if you do go high grade you can scale down to cheap boosters or maybe even no boosters at all.

i fucking love you guys xD the irony is amazing

This pathetic snowflake culture that eve has been gravitating to is just fucking sad and embarrassing. Eve used to be a game where one either played by the motd of HTFU or go back to playing WoW. Now like everything else out there, the general public simply can’t handle being offended. They simply lack the ability to fuck off and get over it. I’ve been playing eve for just over 10 years now and the people on coms were 90% of why I would log on. Now I can barley stand 3/4 of the people I fly with lately due to there overly politically correct and fragile dispositions. This truly is what’s killing eve. 
---
if it works for you, great. I ran into an issue when I got all battleship spawns in all rooms on fire filaments cause of the armor bonus and I was also running just 2 sinks at that time. Basically I ended cutting it very close on the time, not enough if I get DCed or screw up. So I went with 3 sinks and blinged it a bit.
---
Also not sure how you'll do in that vs full neut spawns. The rep you have is low on HP/s and I see you replaced the armor rep rigs with cap rigs. For me, bare minimal HP/s for T4s is 90 to remain comfortable but I like it having much higher. Any lower and it gets dicey with constant overheat management etc.
---
For your implants you can squeeze in turret tracking and armor HP. You can go with 3s or 4s if you don't wanna spend on 5s or do missions for them. Incidentally, you can use the same Vedmak to crank L4s for LP for your implants really easy, just avoid the dampener rats.
---
For the boosters, the 20% standard booster is like 3-4 (goes up and down a bit) mil at Jita, use it or at least keep it in your cargo hold for when you really need it. Hardshell stacks with it. the rep booster is slot 1, Hardshell is slot 11. These 2 boosters make your HP/s per cap very efficient. Excellent vs full neut spawns and the 20% standard booster + Hardshell II combined is a hell of a lot cheaper then Hardshell IV.

They won't be blob HACs, more suited towards small Ops, it wouldn't surprise me if they had the firepower or utility of a Drekavac. Also, the Vedmak already has a very low sig, I wonder if the HAC will go even lower.
---
I think I was astonished more at the fact that apparently there are people that still fly Proteus.

Yup, the latest ship they announced is the "Drake" you would feel right at home.

I am glad to know what the true values of TEST are. So glad there is an organization in EVE willing to stand up to the left and the homosexual agenda.

Do you happen to know where Triglavian ship blueprints drop? I have never been bothered enough to really run abyssals, but at the same time I want to try to get one of the blueprints as a drop.

---
Devs got rid of centering your camera away from your ship in late 2015, so now we can't really have a tracking camera that has both our ship and our target in the same view reliably.
---
I fucking loved that camera. God, why?
---
Thats a good investment, would sell for fking 45 BIL

Don’t know if you’re joking, but I’ve always thought it was inevitable CCP would fall prey to the temptation to screw with cloaking somehow.

Sure they did, they also coffinned characters, which was not cool in the least.

No. They should 1 shot caps on full spool up. Call it "critical meltdown" or something that will also blow up the disintegrator and 1 more random module of the Trig ship.

I agree! It's remarkable. I believe that I could make a B4R post and I'd get downvoted for my PIRAT flair. Shit, they'd probably encourage me to hurt myself.. that's just how toxic and hypocritical all these fucks are.

---
I believe it just increases chances, but at lvl 1 your odds are very low of getting worthwhile bpcs
---
You only need extraction in bulk batches of 6000u/h, so accuracy is mostly irrelevant unless you are barley skimming by on the extraction needs, in which case you are probably running a 2-4 day cycle, and probably doing way more work for very little gain.
---
Have you ever looked at a planet with max skills and baseline skills?  The difference is negligible, and only applies to very short cycles times with the small extractor areas.
---
Interestingly, doing short cycles with 8d extractions is valid as well, and combines the higher extraction rate of short cycles, with the area-coverage of the long cycle.  (This works due to the non-linear extraction rate).

It might even be a case of the word "human" being used as a modifier for "augmented" - i.e. the modifications were done by humans.  Given that Sansha are being discussed, it might even be indicating humans that are augmented in such a way that they retain their free-will / humanity / concept of self.
---
It's called free speech.  Most of the world has it.  You don't have to like it or even listen to it, but he can say it.

Hopefully they do it like the FAX change where if you’re sitting in a armour ship you get armour implants and vice versa

1 - it's bonuses.

2 - Trig ships only have rep range bonuses, not rep amount or any actual logi bonuses like capacitor use.

Given the numerous Slavic references, my money is on "Triglav" being related to the image of a three-headed god:
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglav_(mythology)
---
*An early variation included Svarog, Perun, and Dazhbog. Later, Dazhbog was replaced by Svetovid or Veles. Triglav is usually described as a fusion of these gods.*
---
Some of those names do seem a bit familiar...
---
WOOW!!!!
---
AAR: There were a lot of caps flying around, they didn't seem very coordinated. We blew them up. We went to a random wormhole system, blew up a Korean newbro, and then gave him like a ton of ISk to appease the APM gods. Our objectives were erotic killboard maintenance and low-grade memery and in that sense I must declare it an op success.

Thanks ill look that up! I believed I can do T2s but with bad luck on sites in T1 abyssals, my dps seems a bit low against certain bulkier ships and had around 15secs left on timer if those all happen within same rift. Thats why I havent risked running T2 yet.

If it depends on your monitor, your settings, version of Windows, etc. then it’s very possible for you to have problems we do not.  The reason to submit a bug report in-game is that it provides us all that data so we can more readily reproduce the problem.

question: how do we know that the Trigs are referring to Sansha, Drifters (never heard of them before), and the Drones?

Did they ruin it? No, but it's no longer the monster you once knew it as.

Do they not use alt Corp for jita or did I miss something?

Sorry, but this will only serve to cause Olmeca to think he has an effect on us (he doesn't). Now his head will swell and he will think he is important, and it is all your fault. You should go back to the BBTB3 School for Shitposting for a refresher, your quality has really started to slip.
---
Olmeca will be lulled into a false sense of security, believing he is better than us and this is where we can capture him and through classified persuasive sharp instruments have him correct the record: That he is weak, that women are wrong for men to want, and that the Armenian genocide never happened because Armenians aren't real.
---
Are you saying that people in lowsec don’t use armour slaves in subcaps then?

Also instalockers can’t get you on gates and won’t get you on a fight, only thing to watch out for is smartbombs which is easily avoidable

the corpse belonged to this guy though. (and that exact corpse in fact) https://zkillboard.com/kill/75804184/
---
it seems like somehow I ended up in a phased version of his instance or something, and when his pod popped the assets all despawned (leaving me alone with his wreck and his corpse) for the 30-60 seconds it took for my tank to break.

All going according to the plan.

I think a skill queue pre-made for new beans, that is already cooking on your first log in should cure some of this. Something like eve Uni 14 day skill plan that makes sure you have a good skill base to work with. 
---
I do not think CCP would want you buying Skill point in a custom amount. The skill injects should be a large purchase that is not taken to lightly for new players. CCP wants you to do some preplanning and some decision making before buying them.

Not being able to use high skills for destroyers and frigates on alpha accounts. I really don't care about not having good skills for cruisers and up but not being able to enjoy flying small ships to their fullest without having to sub bugs me.

I just want to get into something small and shoot shit but its kind of hard when someone who's subbed can dunk you with better skills than actual piloting skills.

I'm going to let you in on a super secret that you can't tell anyone ;) that Komodo was intentionally lost by TEST to make Fraternity get cocky and mess up like they did here.

I m pretty sure dick-moves played a role in that whole story.
---
At last count, you've posted thirteen times in this post already...
---
From the Triglavian video: Sansha's face and ships are shown (alongside the words "Corrupted Narodyna"); the face of  Arythmos Tyrannos and an exploding Drifter Battleship are shown (alongside the words "Ancient Enemy Azdaja"); the Rogue Drones aren't shown explicitly however Abyssal Deadspace includes 'Deviant Automata Suppressor' towers which will destroy the smaller rogue drone ships that come into range.
---
Related to this, the enemies encountered in Abyssal Deadspace are 1: Rogue Drones, 2: Triglavian warships, 3: Sleepers, or 4: Drifters. (And the Sleepers are the Drifters' pet drones.)
---
If you've never heard of the Drifters, they are related to the Sleepers (the enemies encountered in Wormhole Space combat sites) however unlike the Sleeper drones, Drifter ships have actual crews. And all Drifter ships have a pilot name, ending in '[Tyrannos](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/1000274/).' Drifter ships deal omni damage and often have extremely strong armor and shields, and will use webs, warp disruptors and scramblers, and energy neutralizers against you.
---
There are 3 places to encounter the Drifters: 
---
1. There are a set of special 'Unidentified Wormhole's which spawn at random across known space, and lead to one of five Drifter-controlled wormhole systems (which contain a *ludicrous* number of other wormhole connections) and are guarded by a set of rather terrifyingly powerful Drifter ships (read: some of them also have Doomsday weapons).
---
2. Class 5 and Class 6 Wormhole Systems have some unique mechanics for their combat sites in which one or more Drifter battleships can be triggered to spawn in addition to the regular site. These ships are not as powerful as the Doomsday-equipped ones found in other places, but are still fast and durable and will absolutely wreck your face if you're not in a group with remote logistics, or in a Dreadnought.
---
3. Abyssal Deadspace rooms can contain a heavily damaged battleship and/or several cruisers. These ships are much weaker than the other ones listed (given that they are intended to be fought 1v1 by cruisers or 1v3 by frigates in a matter of minutes) however if they can get their guns pointed at you you will have a bad day.
---
Generally they are only useful as a last resort against ECM or damps, or if you want to be an afk VNI, but not fly a VNI. They are safe to use, but generally very ineffective. They will shoot someone who "jumps you", by which I mean someone who agresses you. I don't know if they will switch immediately, but they won't shoot someone who goes suspect unless they also attack you. Overall droned do the same thing, but are much better at it.

Good fight and all. They bit off more than they could chew. You thoroughly outclassed them. They welped. Were as useless as nipples on a breastplate. Overwhelmingly defeated. Had less hope than a fart in a windstorm. Rekt!

The incapacity to assign specific items in a ship's cargohold as "locked" so you don't transfer them out when you dock. I have undocked many times with my ship with the only ammo being the ones already loaded into and had to return 2 jumps back to station, maybe this only happens to me.

And yeah came home from eve Amsterdam so thought I’d quickly respond to some of the good questions.
---
This is a real, real nice Guide.   
---
A couple of quick thoughts/suggestions...
---
1) Gallente Industrial to 4 is such a time saver I would recommend it.  It is absolutely worth the train IMHO.  The extra volume of PI you can haul saves you a large number of trips thus saves alot of time.
---
2) Extractor times set to 2 days 1 Hour 30 Mins is the best I have found if you dont mind daily resets.  This is the longest setting that allows 1 hour cycles.  Offers the most reasonable balance and give you a cushion in the even you Miss a day of collection.
---
Just a couple additional thoughts from someone who has done more PI than I care to admit.
---
&amp;#x200B; But i can sit down and of the most interesting things for people and the might of 100 dreads then this whole xix joining legacy thing. how are we the bad guy that isn't my desire.

A whole one ship??? WowzA
---
Looking at the two current threads about this: /r/eve FOAMING at the mere suggestion that using slurs might not be ok? Why am I not suprised lmao.
---
Take Plebius-Maximus' comment on how rabidly /r/eve will defend racism and somehow it seems to fit perfectly here aswell:
---
&gt;Every one of these threads saying players/groups are racist etc, using racist symbols/ something that isn't appropriate are all the same.
---
&gt;They immediately get filled to the brim with people denying there's racism or any other issue in the game, saying 'it's just edgy kids, let them be!' 'ignore it!, It hurts nobody'. Or other forms of deflection. I've not played any other game where the playerbase drops their shit and runs to defend so fucking hard at the slightest mentioned of racism etc. If 'just ignore it, it doesn't hurt anyone' is what you came to say, why can't you just ignore this thread? It doesn't hurt you.
---
&gt;Seems to be people get more offended by allegations of racism etc here than they think people should be offended about racism/ racist symbology etc, which probably says something.
---
&gt;But yeah I could probably post screenshot of a swastika as my corp emblem and have my character name as 'Auschwitzgas chamber6' or something ridiculous like that, and people here would jump through hoops to defend me. It's kinda funny
---
I had them marked in old eveeye's database where i derived the data for this project from. Where i got that data in the first place i cannot remember tbh.

I already want to defend the guy tbh. or at least know what he's done. I'm in for a good laugh or learning more shit I can avoid.

that doesn't really mean anything, the post is about him. 
---
some of you sound fucking insufferable 
---
Thanks, but I kinda want to get into a small gang thing if possible. Or is there a newbie pirate corp?
---
thanks and noted.
---
Lol. I experienced noobs blap experienced noobs.
---
My suggestion would be fly around solo for a bit, convo people who kill you, and ask them what their Corp is like, and if it’s a selective one, ask them to recommend a more newbro friendly one. 
---
Once you’ve got a few suggestions then join one of the corps. I know nothing about any actual FW corps now that Aideron went to null, except that TMOCC is apparently pretty racist, and I only know that because someone put a thread here talking about it
---
I mean, he's not wrong here
---
Tracking com &gt;&gt; stasis web? with TC no problems with drone frigate respawns? 
---
It would be cool if all of sudden gates started opening up in nullsec and invading the alliances in them to take them over that would create some content out there and also bring tons of players out to nullsec and also possibly cause another great war as resources for these area's will dwindled as more invasions occur and losing SOV to this NPC faction which seems interested in recruiting players possibly even having regular eve players in combat against the alliances giving a change to the way nullsec will be done. I dream of something like this happening in Eve with a 5th faction coming to life in the game.
---
&gt;&gt;Triglavs are most likely Enheduanni.

&gt;

&gt;Doubtful. Those  motherfuckers are even more scary.

Pretty funny story as yesterday I've just slept with a girl (in couple for 9years) and spent all my time speaking about EvE. What a timing.

I came to the same conclusion: https://massivelyop.com/2019/03/18/eve-evolved-eve-onlines-storyline-is-about-to-go-off-the-rails/ I figured they're analysing our behaviour and testing our fitness, and those who pass the test may be invited to join them.
---
I'm not entirely convinced they want us to become the fourth clade but I wonder if they plan to give us Jove space. They specifically mentioned Sansha's Nation, who we haven't seen invading Abyssal Deadspace but who we know invaded Jove space because we have footage of them at Prosper Vault. They also mention the Drifters, who see themselves as the inheritors of the Jove empire.
---
So what if they are about to launch a war on Sansha and Drifter forces in the Jove regions, and we must pick a side (prove the direction of our flow)?

I mean, you guys once chased my megathron through 4 systems with a fleet of 10 ish proteuses and faction cruisers until I finally got enough of the game and docked up to get some food and your corp mates didn't have anything better to do than crying cloaks on battleships are gay ... You know what? The one gay thing in this game is high sec war deccing (ok and dropping caps on content that can be handled different but that's not a high sec topic)
---
When you have to awox an open acceptance newbie corp to get a kill...it's pretty sad to "try" and brag about it, it's ok we understand you are compensating for your lack of skill
---
Keep crying like a kid who's dropped their ice-cream.
---
Everyone else will just do that thing they do with you. Roll their eyes and walk away. Me included.

He said "FW space". Why do you think that means just plexes?  I told you already what he said. What is wrong with you? Are you totally retarded or something? Can you read?

Now now, just because most of their logi is in Corp doesn't mean it is logged it.

Great site, but when trying to add fitting, it says "PostPercentage" not found. I guess a bug? I successfully added 1 fitting, but another doesn't work.
---
I see you! MEEHH!
---
Gonna play the devil's advocate, and maybe it's because I'm a (relatively) newer player but I like the newer icons more. They're modernized and fit more into the style of EVE. The old icons just looks cartoony.
---
It's like people only prefer them for the sake of nostalgia or reeeee change.

Hmm that shouldn’t happen. Could you send me the fitting so we can check out why it happens?

It's such a mess and a headache.

This is a great thread.

So was the question answered or did Hy wanton "take" it as rethorical? Are we talking ten tonnes of faggotness or a lesser quantity? How much exactly?

---
Actually, the Aeon has its fans. Me included.
---
Unfortunately CCP ruined some of the ships like the amarrian Interceptors and basically all the Navy ships with that awefull paintjob.
---
I did the calculations for me and in order to fully produce 1 P4 (advanced one) per hour i need 5 characters. At lets say 2m isk/hour, this nets me on a weekly basis 336M isk/week. But the effort every week I have to put in to extract and haul, is around 1 hour. 
---
I can imagine adding pour P4's, but generally, the work you have to put in each week scales linearly. Meaning that i could easily double to 700M isk/week, but it would require an additional work hour, so my isk per hour of time invested is still below the 500M mark.
---
Btw, how can you easily push 500 mil per day? Cause for 2B isk every 4 days with an effort of in total 2 hours, i would like to do that kind of PI. But for me, I only look at 7 day cycles (extraction and factory planets) so i only need to work one time very week, cause I **cannot** play every day (not even 15 min). On top of that, its all in one single system. So I dont see how my setup can be even less intensive. 
---
You produce P4 or specialised P2's? You go from P0 to P2 on plants, or P0 to P1 and then P1-P3 and P3-P4?
---
What the fuck
---
I speak english my guy. 
---
Its only achievable through multiboxing.
---
The sad thing about PI is that its (aside from the hauling part) much less easy to multibox all your characters compared to all other iskfarms that scale linearly per account added (up to a certain point). While you do earn a bit more on average per account added, you dont earn linearly more isk/hour by adding more and more accounts. 
---

Oh yeah. That is a bit too.

Oh ofc. Haven't thought about analyse it with meshmixer first. Should try that. 😉

I wanted to do a full P0-P4 chain by: P0-P1 (cause no need to spend effort trying to balance your two inputs), P1-P3 and P3-P4.

I don't have experience actually doing P0-P2, but is it really that much less intensive?

You need the front-rear balance too, not just port-starboard side balance
---
I mean, don't forget the fact shield supers are going to get a tank nerf. 
---
They're already tankier, so unless ccp forgets common sense, shield supers are gonna get nerfed, so shield pilots will be forced to pay extra to be where they are now.
---
Or ccp will be totally retarded and you'll see 200m ehp komodos, not sure. 
---
Pretty much.  Most PVPers run their AFK VNIs/rorqs WHILE they're pvping, no reason to quit one for the other!
---
Don’t forget about the Revenant...the TWO Revenants...
---
As much shit as goons get, unless you're in their krabbing grounds, most of the time they bring a pretty fun fight.  They have no problems welping cheap shit or even decent shit into your fleet just to get content.
---
Sure, you have the right to say whatever the fuck you want; however, what you do not have the right to is to control people's reactions. So Villy could have started throwing around racist slurs and praising the KKK if he wanted to, that's fine, but everyone else would be well within their rights to shout him down and demand he get banned if he had. 
---
In other words, free speech has nothing to do with it. You can say repugnant things all day long, but when you do and people get pissed about it, you cannot suddenly demand they not do so because "free speech."
---
Pretty much, I have enough isk to welp whatever I want for the forseeable future.  I'm already too lazy to undock my rorq army most of the time.
---
good shit. 
---
&gt;^(hold their hand)
---
EXTRA HERESY
---
P0-P2 is 1/4 the m3 of P0-P1, thus 1/4 the hauling, and 4x the max run length.
---
400m/h per planet is high sec quality planets.  A good planet is easily 2-3x more.
---
This is the same developer that thought supercapitals were gonna be some extremely rare thing.
---
Yes, but it is about to get much, much better.  CCReee confirmed that the FAX nerfs are split, so armor and shield repair caps are seperate.  So if you have both fax on field and are dual tanked, you basically have double effective HP/S once in armor.
---
&gt;G at the mere suggestion that using slurs might not be ok? Why am I not suprised lmao.
---
Yeah, I do not use that word daily when not on twitch to describe people. This says a lot more about you, and r/eve than your comment says about me. 
---
What's happening? Why they being killed in high-sec? Why everyone rejoice?
---
&gt;hen get high and mighty about some Frat slurs being used?  
---
&gt;really interesting.
---
"Until I used that slur used to demean LBGTQ people to describe that guy when I was mad..."
---
Gosh you guys must seriously be experiencing a lack of content if I get the very honor of having my own Nazalgul post, in a week I didn't even log in no less.
---
PS: I like it extra when Goons passive aggressively mention the Armenian genocide just because of my nationality. That happening in my nazalgul post is extra spicy. Thanks!

I don't think (rightly so) this apology will be enough to save your dream of being on the CSM. RIP.

i'm a wormhole content creator when i play, effort into kills is kinda my jig tbh. sonia angel was the last individual i caught playing gates and y'all kicked her from corp; i haven't played much since then. in my experience though, i'm not baiting y'all out to a gate when i can get better fights in-chain
---
It's not going to work.
---
The brightness of a lot of the stars (Suns) and lack of particle adjustment. I'm an older player and when I have a long play session, like on weekend or alike, it really hurts my eyes and starts to give me headaches. My brightness settings are already all the way down and making it darker via GPU or monitor settings doesn't work since then other elements of the game become too dark. 
---
So as a result of this I end up doing some weird camera acrobatics while playing which is just bad and pisses me off.
---
Particle settings adjustment like every half decent modern game has. I love the explosions and don't want to completely turn them off, just tone them down to where I need them to be but can't because Eve is too old and outdated and is the only game I have that doesn't have an option for it :(
---
Man between olmeca and marshy you bee dudes really like talking about people you hate/don't like
---
This hero moved his scams past Jita, and right to some cuck's wife.
---
Ok we found a bug indeed, could you try to upload that fitting again?
---
I like tracking comps better then webs because webs tend to get out of synchronization with small targets dying and before I know it am wasting a ton of time using web. Don't have to fuck with turning it on/off all the time, just keep it on and be done with it. Also, I like straight line kiting much better, just switch ammo and burn away a bit just enough so that they don't get into orbit on you.
---
If something does get into a very fast orbit on you, you can simply burn away from it or switch to a more distant target then come back to the pesky one later. Alternatively, you can overheat your prop mod for a cycle or two, that always does the trick and lines them up nicely.
---
Just a 1005? What a pleb. 
---
Sounds like you need more nanos in the lows
---
implying youre worth the effort. fuck off carebear.
---
Level 1 / 2 ? VNI or Caracal is fine. I'd stay away from the turret boats if you wanna stick with Abyss sites since they are unfortunately fairly sub optimal in the high tiers. Its doable ... but you'll be gimping yourself if you do. I only do Abyss in turret ships for novelty when I get bored. That's it.
---
Supporting the above. Also adding something, because I made more work for myself by thinking that because I log in daily and 30min extraction cycles was more efficient than 60min extraction cycles (it is, but there's a penalty).
---
If you stop extraction and restart, the planet resources react as if you had taken the full volume of the expected extraction. These resources are dynamic and not infinite, while they do recover over time. 
---
* Doing something silly like setting a 4day extraction (with an awesome start and meh after a couple days) "just in case" and then restarting it every day or every other day is a horrible plan and will kill your planet's output. Don't restart if you're less than 50% to 75% through your extraction duration except in extreme circumstances (say you've set it for 2 days, but 12 hours later you find out you have to go away for a week and want to reset it to 7 days).
---
* Using the 15min extraction cycles will give you more P0 than 30min cycles, but within a few days you will find your hotspot becoming a little cooler, and especially in HS planets or with scarcer resources, it may dry up completely, meaning more frequent tearing down and repositioning. Remember you have to pay for building those factories etc. and, as well as it being a time sink, don't want to be doing this every week. 30min cycles will dry it up but you'll probably get a couple of weeks before you get a noticeable drop. 60min cycles are optimal because they don't noticeably affect the output for a long time, unless it's super scarce (&lt;3%) and in HS, and you can go a few months before having to do more than shift some heads slightly, and 2hr+ are pretty much zero ecological impact (but horrifically inefficient so only really good for if you are literally unable to log into the character more often). Again, all of that presumes not stopping and restarting too early.
---
* Right click on the planet's surface and 'view other players' to see where other people are extracting before setting up shop (you see their command centers and clicking on them shows their links, factories, and extractor hubs but not heads). If a planet is heavily populated, it might be worth looking elsewhere, or at the very least choose hotspots away from others. As above, extracting a hotspot faster than it can regenerate will deplete it quite quickly, so if two people are pulling from the same spot, you may find it dries up and you need to move to allow it to regenerate. You can't see who the owners of the other setups are, but as well as it being an inconvenience to both of you having to shuffle more frequently, you may find that the other player owns the customs office and will raise taxes to dissuade their competitors from messing up their PI, or even start watching to see who is coming to the customs office and look to gank you as retribution. Also, someone might intentionally follow you on-planet just to mess up your PI. PI PVP is a thing - albeit rare because it costs isk just to troll someone - but worth being aware so you don't get your productivity impacted by it, or unintentionally start a war by appearing to be engaging in it. Remember, a lot of skill farm characters PI to offset the cost of MTC licenses, so they can get quite serious if you screw with their margins.
---
Never say never but we got atleast one that I know of in wormholes, [Talocan destroyer](https://imgur.com/a/ckJIVpE) that I took screens in december 2014.
---
Things maybe changed since I visited
---
I imagine they would run out of fun gank targets long before they run out of ratting tax to spend. VoV
---
So.  
---
I believe that these new items from the Triglavian Tier 5 rare sites are a way of the Triglavian being able to communicate with Elite capsuleers.  
---
Only those who have proven themself through the highest tier of Abyssal get access to them. Which would be deliberate, and explains why the origin gate is allowed to stay open without killing the trigs inside the room (Who are evidently showing off their power and giving out these communication items.)

I mean, the items even say to thouroughly keep an eye on them, and in Evesterdam JUST NOW on stream they were referred to as communication devices.  
---
Why would you apologize to the guy who STARTED the conversation with calling you faggot sucking all sorts of dicks?
---
Gtfo here with your 8chan bullshit. Free speech doesn't give you the right to regurgitate hate without consequences. Your type are the people who want consequence-free spaces for their hatred.

There are more people triggered about SJWs on the internet than triggered SJWs themselves lol.
---
Botting.
---
More specifically, the lack of action by CCP to address the botting problem. Many years ago, EVE had its fair share of groups in the drone regions that would sell ISK online but it was never as bad as it is now. I think a combination of skill trading, alpha accounts, the serenity migration, and cheap supers drove botting and RMT off the deep end. It's causing inflation and ruining the game for honest players. Why be legit if CCP isn't going to punish people who cheat? 
---
Like, the number of botters and RMTers our community exposes that don't get banned astounds me. The same goes for the suspicious AF killmails (from the usual suspects, of course) that you'd think CCP would look into...but they seemingly don't. Why is that? As an honest player who has earned my nice things, I want to know.
---
A few highlights:

https://zkillboard.com/kill/75397972/
---
INB4 "how do you know they're cheating". 
---
I don't, but that's not the point. The point, is that I'd actually like to feel more confident that CCP is using their resources to weed out cheaters. If they were, we'd have a healthier economy. 
---
yeah,come and conquer npc...cant wait for it....really i want it no troll
---
reduce  isk flow in game ,make ppl fight for a living,like used to be:fight for domination in mission ihub,make ppl to move in search for isk...thtas gona bring content...atm is so much isk in game is no incentive to fight for anything....make citadels drop loot,no thetering while u got agro timer(either npc or player)...ccp just went in dumbfuck mode with easy isk
---
That directional scan is still manual only.
---
Not even bounties ?
---
Its just the usual stuff, RLML in the heights DDAs in the lows. Mids: MWD, Thukker large cap bat, X-Type LSB, Adaptive Invul and a Thermal Dissipation Field II (you overheat it against triglavians). Rigs:  Whatever you want, I do EM shield rig + 2x Core Defense Operational Solidifier.
---
Planetology 4 + Advanced Planetology 3 reveals hotspots not seen with the base skills. It's not about accuracy of output volume, but finding those extraction zones that base skill characters cannot see. I have one char with 4-3 and one with 4-0 in the same area, and the former can find gorgeous hotspots that the other cannot even see when both looking at the same planet (the latter character has mostly factory planets with a couple for top-ups on more needed but plentiful resources, so not worth investing in her extraction skills). 
---
There's also screenshots out there (sorry, can't remember where I found them last time) of the differences at 1-0, 2-0, 3-0, 4-0, 5-0, 4-1, 4-2, 4-3, 4-4, 4-5, 5-1, 5-2, 5-3, 5-4, and 5-5. Outcome is that there is a massive difference in each skill up to 3, and only minimal differences in going up to 4 or 5. Since you need Planetology 4 to get Advanced Planetology, the optimal is 4-3 to see all 'secret' hotspots as accurately as needed, and negligible benefit training either beyond that (but obviously doesn't hurt to have mildly more accuracy). 
---
Always recommend 4-3 as the training required for efficient use, just with the caveat that lower SP characters can function find below this, and higher can get better skills if they want (it's just not necessary).
---
I thought they fixed this a while back, I'm not too sure people used to do it to try to land jams.

nice write-up, thanks!
---
I've been out of the loop for ages, my memory of the whole eve lore is a bit foggy.... but what's with the entity that "possessed" Jamil? Wasn't that what the Talocan were scared of when they build there dyson-wh/gate-thingy around caroline's star? ...meaning that threat has been around for ages...
---
(and did that have something to do with the dark-eyed "sleeper" in their construct? or are those the "normal" drifters?) 
---
Aren't the Trig aware/afraid of that thing as well?
---
I'm sure I'm making a mess of things here, or I'm simply missing a lot... so if someone can help and/or throw me a link to a chronicle or so, I'd very much appreciate it.

Read mails. ;)
---
They do reset so yeah spam them if you want.
---
&gt;It's okay to say "faggot" *ironically*, 
---
It's really not. 2016 should have taught us that lesson.  Using that language "ironically" gives cover and support for those that really believe it.  You create a space where that kind of thing is okay.  Even if you take that support away when they start getting crazy, it's too late.  You already have unironic Nazi rallies and Heather Heyer gets killed by someone taking slightly shittier than normal  memes seriously.
---
This isn’t a picture of me!
---
They will be automatically changing your old slaves to the new amulets
---
Don't say that too loud, CCP may get the idea to start working on a new "improved" overview.
---
The mission agents finder. We went from having a fully functional one to the current one which borders on useless.
---
The sameaapplies for the skill queue system.

I can't tell if that's an ironic TISHU flair.  Thanks for confirming exactly to everyone's expectations though.

And now those new players will have to deal with "in corp" logi, that will be docked or in surrounding systems/at pings waiting to warp in. Still not visible on grid to those new players you care for so much. Nothing really changes for pirat with the logi change you're so pleased with.
---
I'd argue that blanket deccing, and trade hub camping is worse for HS (the new bro's) than if logistics are in or out of corp. Groups that want to have 100 wars and put no effort into them, who just sit and wait for food to fly into their mouth should go camp a lowsec gate. leaving wars to those who have an actual interest in killing each other for reasons other than "we saw you undock from jita in something we want to kill in 24 hours"
---
Surprisingly nothing like that is in CCP's roadmap to "FIX" wars lol.
---
It's just sad that some people are content with undocking and warping to the same gate 50 times a day, that's what "PVP" is to them, anything more is too difficult for those type of players to figure out.
---
Just be warned that it’s a known exploit that will earn you a ban if your opponent complains 
---
No way to have multiple item folders in a station.  I know they have limited filters.  I want a folder called stuff to sell, exploration fits, etc.
---
No, seriously.  Listen to the guy and try to do some self-reflection.  This isn't healthy for you (or anyone around you).
---
Yep they are in c2-HS/C3

yeah fuck you guys and your RTM'ing super botting ops.

Yes, they'll get renamed and keep the same item id.

Yea, let me stop you right there.  You get a member count for wars and logi does not appear on the killboard.  You guys abuse this shit.

The mechanics groups like pirat use, well, you're bottom feeders to be frank.  Tell me, does pirat and marmite declare war on one another?  Or whoever the other hi sec warrior competition is?

Why not, its good content, right?

I am certain there is a list leadership keeps of who not to declare war on because they actually fight back.

So stop.

he thinks talocans and anoikis are jovian sub-factions dude

not really your guy on getting up to speed on anything
---
talocans are another precursor race and anoikis are literally wormhole systems

talocans are a precursor race like takmahl, yan-jung etc

anoikis are wormhole systems

it is not on the known exploit list, do you know where CCP announced that?

Last point.

When I worked at UPS all of a sudden Id spot every fucking UPS truck driving on the road, else I never noticed just how many of them there were.

I really hope this change crimps you guys playstyle enough so some break away and join a proper organization with proper fleet fights.  Its so much fun not living off of the salt &amp; tears from new players.

That's why we don't talk about you &lt;3

Vagas and Phantasms work wonderfully for 3/4s.

---
(IIRC, might be wrong here) 
---
The Jove were some religious sect wanting to start there own society\*. They Jove themselves were technologically the least developed at the time (think Space-Amish). 
---
To build their ships and transport them to their new home, they hired the Enheduanni. They weren't "Amish", they were "up to date" engineers and scientists at the time... so if the Jove managed to evolve from space-amish to Jove, then the Enheduanni must be ages ahead.
---
(\*when the eve gate collapsed, they survived without a dark-age because they traveled with the rather slow motherships, not using any gate-system. They therefor never expected supplies from the EVE gate and weren't hit by the collapse at all, they brought anything they needed for their "closed" society with them in their motherships)
---
Station containers, dude. 
---
Jibrish and Koahi added that in!
---
Assuming that CCP removes it also - but mostly it is about pointing out how many capital mods you can fit. 
---
You need cap to run shield tank. 
---
My god you really aren't too bright are you.
---
Really not very self aware...
---
Also ShareX is a great open-source alternative to shitty gyazo software.
---
Can you provide or point me to more details on how to do this? 
---
I been playing here and there and I keep spending more time every time I login. Pandemic HORDE?
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/kill/75845342/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75845342/) 
---
I mean his midslots aren't *great,* but that's at least a coherent attempt at a shield tank without any armor/hull mods.
---
Isn't Anoikis just the Jove name for W-Space?
---
Were the Talocan a Jove faction? I thought they build the dyson-sphere around Carolines star long before the Jove arrived there... I might be wrong, but I thought the Talocan and Yan Jung were independent "ancient" races that survived the collapse relatively unscathed.
---
Can you share a vaga fit pls?
---
we all have two titans so giving those away would be kind of pointless.
---
Maybe the shield slaves and rep changes will roughly cancel each other out.
---
Three. There is also a talocan cruiser and battle ship
---
Where can I find more on these people in the lore? The lore portion if EVE is awesome, but it's not very well organized on the website :/
---
yes if we could fly them.  also look at hull of that talocan ddessie,front side has   amarr designs?
---
to be 120 titans a side or more ## CJ Agnon-07/18/2018 God speed to us it is was in INITIAL reinforce.

many pi related things: that the customs office doesn't have twice the cargohold of an epithal, but only about half of its cargohold; that you can't "upgrade" planetary structures to 2x/3x (using the appropriate multiplier, possibly even with a small markup to account for less links), that there's no "link this material to all appropriate consumers" button and you have to die the death of a thousand clicks; i think i had some other ui suggestions there, but i since extracted the pi skills to preserve the tattered remains of sanity that i still might have

some expensive dreads, dang

13 accounts holy shit

That would be against the EULA:
---
&gt;overlays using elements from a second or multiple other EVE clients to allow the player to activate modules etc. on those other game instances without switching to the other client windows are clearly in violation of our rules.

No, go away.

In a game about exploding spaceships I would rather the Devs spent what time they had making more spaceships explode rather than second Life space edition

but what about goryn clade
---
Can't tell if you're trolling or an idiot
---
People have asked for Walking in Stations, as well as Flying in Atmosphere / Landing on z Planets since the game came out 15+ years ago.
---
The *only* reason we got Captains Quarters was because they had a contract for another game. And they wanted us to test the mechanics for that. Once that contract flopped, they lost any interest in CQ.
---
You mention that every MMO allows your characters to interact. But you think our meatsuits are the characters. The only think the meatsuits are for is a paper doll for your pilot license photo and a storage vessel for Skill Points. The "characters" are the ships. Where other games would have you giving your character new armor and weapons, we get in better ships with better fittings.
---
That's why we'll never see WiS again. If they could, they'd just have us all be brains in jars. But it's more profitable to sell us clothes for our paper dolls. 
---
Cat ears when?
---
Devs don't make spaceships explode, players do. Nice try
---
Counter offer, you go away. 😎
---
Again, it would help the RP community and create a lot more immersion.

The old Aura voice was just sexier somehow.

Only thirteen accounts?

Alright, alright,alright! Minmatar on the field!

Uhh, evidence of this?

Trig Sotiyo when?!

Brave newbies has a wormhole Corp, in addition to Eve uni as mentioned before.

It's not an exploit. Kinda cheesy, but hey, if you have the spare APM why not.
---
Q: how do you know when TEST kills a cap?
---
A: when you go to Reddit and see 30 posts with 19 videos of the same shitty fight.
---
TEST, act like you've been there before.
---
Oh, wait, you are TEST.
---
Average is not the right measure. Median is probably more like 1.5-2.
---
Sure, but it's not going to happen. They had it, they had people working on it (for the World of Darkness game, but having us test it). And now they've turned it off and moved those people to other projects.
---
They also said the stats for people using CQ were tiny compared to the resources needed to run it. It's too much effort for a mere handful of people that would use it.
---
If, and it's a big if, they could be persuaded to turn it on and add more... I think they would only bother with the hub stations. That's where the most people gather in station. Plus, one of the old trailers shows a woman shooting a man in his quarters, and I'd love to go inside and shoot the scam spammers. =) 
---

(This is from the time when the Drifter storyline started)
---
Oh shit. The only event left is the re-opening of the Eve Gate.
---
I can already see it, us fighting alongside Triglavian NPCs vs a full drifter+sansha+Rogue Drones invasion, as Sansha and The Others strike a deal and combine their knowledge to control Rogue Drones. As the battle rage on the baddies trigger a massive superweapon from a whole new ship, wiping clean the entire battlefield, friends and foe alike, and triggering the re-opening of the Eve Gate.
---
And in the shadows, the SOE laugh.
---
Yeah that was a great trailer. I don't think it needs to be trade hubs, so much as your own personal/corp areas

The Player-constructed Stargate will be how we progress through a new Universe : The Milky Way.
---
We'll cross the Eve Gate that will be reactivated with the final event of the Prophecy, and then we'll find that everyone's dead and everything's destroyed. We will scavenge what we can find to construct our own Stargate, both in the new cluster and back in New Eden.

I always enjoyed the chronicles/short stories/books, most of it is sprinkled around. A great example with a lot of Jove lore is  [https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/chronicles/inheritance/](https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/chronicles/inheritance/) , I can only recommend it. 
---
The link Zendane\_Eve already posted as a response is a great summary/overview, it also includes other sources like in-game events. 
---
But I would still recommend reading the chronicles also, some of them are really great to read and give the whole EVE Universe much more depth. 
---
Yup, though looks like they identity themselves as test pets nowadays lol
---
vni ratting, pi, station trading
---
There is things on CCP roadmap to fix that, wtf are you talking about? Headquarters for the attacker, defenders been able to instantly renew a War without the 24h cooldown... Merc corps will have a great time with these changes, as defenders can contract one to ref the headquarter and if the attacker try to save it by ending the war timing with the 24h period, defenders can roll over that with the new mechanic.
---
snort my b hole 
---
The popout bookmark window (or whatever its called) not updating when you move to an other system. You have to reopen it EVERY time. So annoying.
---
We are still missing a replacement for the small (faction) POS, fast anchoring and fast packing - much like a mobile home.
---
Nothing was announced yet
---
One question , why should so holders not defend their space with over the top response fleets ? 
---
Idk wtf this is, but I now know what I want for breakfast

Is that a real skin? I'm into it haha.

can I get a Delve visa to pew pew him?
---

---
So many mangos itt.
---
Regarding what this guy says, you can't trash items in a citadel that is reinforced (or maybe that's specific to wormhole space? idk), that way attackers get to be able to loot.  
---
So sad asset safety exists in p-word/f-word/what Vily said-word - space like nullsec, things would be so much more interesting otherwise.
---
I ADORED the captains quarters, it was fun to "chill" and enjoy the view after a long day of try harding in ship spin mode.
---
It's something that really feels missing now that it's gone, even though it was never really significant. Seeing your character and the interior of stations was super immersive and I wish it was fleshed out more, I remember feeling disappointed when I realized that all the stations had the same quarters (per faction of course) and would have loved to explore the different "stations" and their design philosophies.
---
It made the game cozy.

important question: how do you embed youtubes
---
Thank you for doing spods work
---
Here I am with 1 account/character that does everything, still gets kills, has fun, and does what i need to do.

Alts are only truly "needed" if you are doing capital/cyno shenanigans, farming (skill farm, rorq, VNI etc). I've never had a need for an alt though.
---
Solo scouting, best scouting.

But then again, trusting SNUFF not to awox is like trusting /pol/ not to say n-word every 5 seconds.

WORMHOLER BTW
---
Lol liberals literally invented the word triggered, you realize that right?
---
The Drake in SC was announced this week.
---
So, increasing pirate LP store isk prices would have the effect you're looking for. Other than that CCP is/has been nerfing anomalies, capital ships, rorquals and increasing isk sinks drastically in the game.
---
Just thought you should know you're pretty late with that idea, CCP is doing that with proposed changes.
---
oh hyper...
---
I did the same thing is morning savory pancakes all the way.
---
We've come across this dude before in a wormhole. Every one of his ships target you at the same time, they all red box at the same time and they all move to align at the same time... This was his tornado fleet.
---
It's obvious what he's doing. But its also impossible for anyone other than CCP or the actual dude to prove, so just stick in a petition and be done. Having the same portrait doesn't mean anything unfortunately.
---
But why is PLEX going up?
---
So i failed them and in some cases*. But, WH corps will take Alphas in some cases*. But, WH corps will take alphas and actively awoxes those that do plex.
---
&gt;if a new player is in a corp and the corp is decced its the leadership wing that is gathering intel, not the hi sec line member.  leadership is weighing the fight since its their wallet.  
---
&gt;so for a fleet fight this change is welcome.  
---
&gt;no idea how anyone sees this as a negative.  neutral logi is a broken mechanic. 
---
I mean yeah, they never died. But when you're a pet like corp who relies on someone else for protection, them getting evicted sort of ruins that relationship :p
---
Well it did take a lot of pilots to take it down, so they must be doing something right.
---
Yeah 13 accounts for a carebear, I bet their kill board is a barren wasteland lol

Please let us burry this.

A few things: drone ship with correct modules, correct tank, correct BCU...

remove mobile depot reinforcement timer

fixes all the issues with it at the same time

Cute little titan fleet up there mate

Lmao literally omegatriggered irl
---
It's a damage multiplier.
---
It's easy to say noone use a feature when you don't release anything for it since the failed release, especially when the UI and optimization of said feature is catastrophic.
---
Theres a huge market for barbie online, see how much is spend despite the actual state of the game on avatar customization
---
What kind of evidence do you expect? Some tricks are just known for years as exploits, people have been banned before for it. For obvious reasons ccp doesn’t provide any exhaustive list of exploits and keeps quiet about them. If you want to risk your account go ahead, you have been warned. You will likely get away with it for a while until you stumble upon someone with a bit of experience that will report you and then you’ll come here whining about being banned with no explanation and how clean you are. Especially if it’s trick like these that even dumb GMs know about. 
---
This feels like a build up to drifters being a new playable race.  They'll eventually get capsuleer tech in exchange for their ships and good standing, then they will be granted the tech and CCP will make them playable. 
---
The advantage/point is to spam messages. Corporation advertisements are by far the most common.

They're basically rogue billboards littered over the landscape.

&gt; remove mobile depot reinforcement timer
---
The reinforcement timer does serve a valid purpose. But perhaps it needs to be a lot shorter in high-sec? Or better still, just remove the ability to rename these things? You can't spam messages if you can't attach them to a depot.
---
Just someone from CCP saying "this is an exploit", thats literally all the evidence you'd have to provide.
---
I told the two others to boson. instead a newer titan pilot had a dominating subcap position. we were unequal partners and also having meaningful jobs to be fair the TEST/co2 in sh1 was co2 going full retard, saying thats where we should have jumped into sh1 i laugh and you will fall.
---
People other than when CCP needs it to the player who lost the titan, still not happening?
---
&gt;The reinforcement timer does serve a valid purpose.

no it doesnt

Oh neat people are botting Reddit comments now.  Wonderful.

working on some backlog now actually.

BOTS weren't an issue until CCP let people Plex and play for free. Just saying.

All that cancerous Russian spam. 
---
So you need 13 alts to be elite.?! No wonder Eve is shit.
---
Cunt certainly, at least in Australia. Haven't heard faggot.
---
[Re this tweet from CCP](https://twitter.com/EveOnline/status/1109829980710678528). Draugr is, famously, undead in Skyrim and Elder Scrolls. Which means that there will now be an undead faction in Eve. So, Sylvanas is coming. Protect your trees.
---
13 when only looking at the top/most dedicated players. Not sure what metric they used or what the source is.
---
We bragged about it you realise most players in the time to be guessing what your stepson does.
---
Doesn't make him a bot, lol. A depot is like 1 mill, why would he care? Was he in a hauler or smth? What did you expect him to do? This is speculation so bad that even your unfounded allegations don't strongly indicate a botter, and those allegations aren't even supported. 
---
EVE Had bots even before those. It simply wasn't that much looked at. Altough it certainly seems to have increased in size after alpha clones became a thing.
---
It's not really any different than the old XML API.  You can visit https://community.eveonline.com/support/third-party-applications/ to revoke access to granted applications.  (Apps using V2 SSO routes do not show up yet).
---
A password change on your account would also invalidate all your tokens/refresh_tokens.
---
So tl;dr they only have access for as long as you want to give them access.
---
I need 5 more accounts to be a carebear?  Damn it, I thought I was already one.

ISBoxer 
---
Amazing, subscribed. Wat game is the video 'Fucking 49ers' from? 
---
People look at these numbers and think what the Krab does with them (Rorqual alts), but forgets elite PvPers use a lot of accounts too, either as a way for them to drop a hammer on somebody with bombers, catalysts, or titans, to cloak camp systems, to seed spies into other alliances, or just for their scamming. 
---
Ah the Angel capital ships. 
---
What 5 bots that people paid cash for? You rarely seen them. If Ever. Trust me I've been around for a very long time in Eve. We never seen bots and if we did at least we knew they paid $$$ out of pocket for them to sub them. Unlike the unwashed masses of basement dwelling no lifers that now grace us with bots.
---
&gt; What did you expect him to do?
---
Not keep feeding me mobile depots to kill? Do *anything* different other than continuously anchoring depots until they ran out?
---
To an intelligent person, it would be clear where this was going after the first one was destroyed. To an unintelligent person, it should have been obvious after the second one.

I’ll just leave this here

Actually, now that I think about it, you don't even have to pay for this.
---
Alphas can anchor mobile depots...
---
Dammit CCP!
---
With Grids 10000km wide, you certainly can spam messages even though you can't attach them to a single depot.
---
OOF
---
Old Tengu could push ~500 overheated w/ rage. Not great but by far closest to old proteus dps. Of course rage meant limited application vs most targets solo.

Way back when deep in Russian space. Plenty of videos  up of people hunting them pre-alpha clone on youtube

That bug got me killed once.i was cloaked off a gate at 3000km afk for a few and some gang burned at me and decloaked me and shot my face off. RIP 300 mil Sabre 😄

Is everything okay in home, friend?
---
Why didn't the enforcer have a rep on it? 
---
here I thought all humans were the same race whoops
---
I think Im getting it confused with shield booster. Sorry, pretty new. Cap boost mods would be cool but what shield recharge mod are they speaking of? Seems like this helps solo and small gangs a little but just my guess.

Also do note, that they can't actually do anything to your account, they can only read info (Until you revoke it ofc).

Well depending on the scopes he gives, it would be _possible_ for them to send mails on your behalf, set your destination, or open UI windows.  
---
However changes are this is unlikely to happen, but can be helpful in some cases.  I.e. FC can just set the destination for everyone in his fleet versus people always asking what is destination.

i have 4 accounts right now literally doing nothing but training, and not as a skill farm.  there's plenty of reasons.

How some "universal" skins like khanid, blood raiders, eom etc don't exist forus to buy even though they exist in npc ships. I'd pay mad cash for khanid and eom skins

Fuck the agency. I came back after a year and a half or so and got a maze escalation, and it took forever to find the damn thing.

Then again I had to work to find the option to warp to the acceleration gate once I got to the system.

It used to be the same back in the day with secure containers. People would anchor them at the edge of gate grid with corporation advertisements all the time. Oddly enough I mostly recall it being Russian advertisements back in the day, not sure what it's like now as I've not been paying much attention to them any more. Stuff like MOONPIRE should be prevented though, I swear it takes significantly longer to load Perimeter gate grids just because of the amount of junk on them.

hey, i want my Chinese takeaway to be good god damn it!

There's a mid slot module called a shie;ld recharger, which no one ever uses after they lose their first regen-tanked mission raven and googles up a workin fit. Because they're terrible and give less hp/s than an LSE.
---
900dps. Can you link that fit? Been tinkering with pyfa to see how things are now and haven't gotten that high so far.
---
I highly doubt vily has the stones to go after snuff in any meaningful way.
---
I meant for hardware support.
---
They use groups of servers to host different solar systems. That's why you can experience TiDi in an empty system, b/c that same system is supported on a server that's also supporting a system where there's a fleet battle raging. Jita runs on its own server all by itself, purely b/c of how many people are in there at any given time.
---
When they were running CQ, they had to put all those apartments on the servers as well, which takes away from the outer space resources. If they were going to put them back up and running, it would be a lot easier for them to put 4 online (one for each hub) than it would be to put each station in the universe back online. If you figure there's roughly 5 stations per system, and 5200+ systems, that's 26,000+ stations and 26,000+ station interiors they have to flesh out.
---
Poor korean guy
---
tbf that's an average not a median though so it could be skewed by a lot of skill farms. i'd be way more interested in knowing the percentile distribution for number of accounts.
---
I launch a mobile depot when I run into a hole with lots of sigs and refit my high slot to a nos/neut from the core scanner
---
I then store my booty in the can after I run each site, minimizing my loss during the time when I am most vulnerable - running the site.  
---
Rinse, repeat until the jsig is clean of pirate relic/data sites.
---
If I have over 200m on ship, I am finding my way to high sec to sell, if not, continue on to the next jsig. 
---
Without a timer, it would be pretty shitty.
---
To allow it to reinforce in hi sec is stupid with access to all the stations but wh's there is certainly a purpose for it. 
---
People didn't bot as much because ISBoxer and input broadcasting was allowed back in the day. But because that's now easily detectable, people switched to botting instead. It's also worse because people use MORE bots than they used to ISBox because ISK/h is worse. Incursion boxers were a truly incredible sight with 40 nightmare fleets instantly evaporating NPC ships. I think rattlesnake boxers are still a thing, but they are obviously not as efficient because one button can't command the entire fleet any more.
---
Obviously getting rid of ISBoxer is a good thing - one person shouldn't be able to perform perfect bomb runs or run HQ Incursions solo, but it simply moved the problem to a different place. People will try to skirt the rules to avoid the grind.
---
I am buying them at 1.5 Billion Isk a Unit. 
---
it needs a damage cap instead
---
If I weren't a bot, but was the kind of person who writes advertisements in space in mobile depots, I would probably figure I could outlast you if I just kept dropping depots.
---
I am echoing what I heard from (I believe) CCP Fozzie. The issue being is when you apply the bonus of the implants against shield hitpoints it had unintended impact. This caused a major delay in the implementation, and now we are finally getting it. 
---
What do you mean by “the scopes I give”?
---
This entire presentation felt high school like.
---
Numbers were being pulled out of thin air, much of his argumentation relied on second hand, anecdotal sources.

He peppered it with some common knowledge from a sociology 101 class on how critical thinking and social support networks improve problem solving capabilities.
---
It all felt incredibly amateuristic and cherrypicked.

Depots are 50m3; torpedoes are 0.05m3. Even in a hauler full of them, you're going to run out of depots before anyone runs out of ammo.

I really admire how expertly you demolished that strawman you put up yourself.

I personally believe nationalism, no matter what nation will eventually lead to either nothing of value or ruin. Nothing good ever comes from it.

Walking in stations is still gone.

But this guy had sex, so it can’t be anyone in TEST.
---
You are gay, you don't kiss girls
---
Most hardcore pvpers stop between 3 and 5 accounts for many reasons. Most people won't control more than 2 subs at once (3 if one is links or something) and having 1-2 accounts for caps, supers, and hunters is about app you can manage. Hardcore hunters like mar5sy obviously have more but I don't know many pvpers that have more than 5 accounts. At that point you're probably paying $75 USD a month to run that since you're not really bearing. Not gonna get an additional $15 worth of value out of more accounts. 
---
If I ever flew an Erebus I'd hull tank it like a Brutix Navy.
---
Er sorry, would be more accurate to say `depending on the scopes the application is requesting`.  I.e. when you're on the step after you login and are presented with a list of scopes that the application is requesting, with options to `authorize` or `cancel`.
---
Before Plex people sold game time cards for isk on the forums
---
But when Hy says Vily needs to bend over and take it from Mittens? its not faggy faggy?
---
I still don't think this is a valid argument for having a reinforcement timer. If it was, mobile depots should also have a reinforcement timer because they are storing valuable loot, but they dont. If its in space you need to be ready to lose it. Don't consider it yurs until it's in station
---
Sounds like a very good update but tbh I hope the shield regen doesn’t get stacking penalties, atleast not the low slot ones. In singularity I LOVE making ridiculously tanky shield ships that require multiple other ships or a ship way above its class to kill it

Idk know why this is surprising. 13 is not a crazy amount for someone who spends an average of 4.5 hours a day in game. 
---
They add up (using elite player let’s assume they are a Strat OP FC)
---
1: Monitor Pilot/Boosting Pilot
---
2: Main Sub-Cap toon
---
3: Dread Alt
---
4: Carrier Alt
---
5: Super
---
6: Titan
---
7: Super - FAX Alt
---
8: Titan - FAX Alt 
---
9: +1 Scouterino 
---
10: Spai account
---
11: Crab Account 1
---
12: Crab Account 2 
---
This is just a basic example of how it can add up. The only ones you’d probably need to “pay” for are the Sub-cap toon (due to a FUCK TON of skills needed for sub-caps). As capitals are pretty low-SP requirement you can just inject them to what you need or buy them already trained and then just SP farm on them for the majority of the PLEX price.

You sound mad.
---
My base assumptions for this were more or less "You live in null and your alliance (or a stable allied group) controls the POCOs." I recognize that that is not a universal case. Obviously if doing lowsec/hisec, your concerns will definitely need consideration, as there will be a lot more potential sharing of resources. Heck, getting 18k P0/hour out of your extractors is likely unreasonable for hisec and maybe even lowsec unless you find fantastic planets, so you could likely scale down to 12k units/hour or whatever. (I obviously wrote this for my alliance originally, who has space out in null, so yeah gonna be some oversights for the general audience). Good info though, thanks!
---
Wormhole daytripping and whatnot was one of the stated goals of mobile depots in the first place, particularly for shattered wormholes.  The reinforcement timer is pretty critical to that aspect.

I guess the "cartoony" look is why I honestly found them easier to work with. Some things might just be "reeeee change" (the undock button being moved has long since stopped bothering me), but the buttons continue to be a source of immense frustration when picking the right one.

I guess I'm a substance-over-style kind of guy - I won't deny Eve in general has gotten less 'cartoony' over the years, and the new buttons fit the new Eve better, but hooo boy do they annoy me.

If this was a bot, why would it drop a second depot? A bot would put down a depot and continue on. It wouldn't know that you'd killed the depot it just placed.
---
I think this was a player that just was ok spending a couple million to watch you get butt-blasted. That's what I'd do if I was that guy.
---
Sorry man, it’s the only way for us to do a spy check on ya :/

Spy check?

Impressive the you call snuff edgelords then use "REEEE" and use autistic as an insult
---
I mentioned this in one of the other threads as well but we don't choose what meetings CCP request for the summit so that is why there isn't a session for it. CCP doesn't have any plans to work on it in the near future so there isn't much point in having a session dedicated for it.
---
We did talk a lot about FW and Lowsec outside the meeting room but sadly that doesn't show.
---
Embarrassing post
---
Sure that's an example of what you could use 13 accounts for. It's not realistic or common, but it definitely is something you just made up. 
---
Yikes
---
well they need to spread out announcements through the whole year. i assume huge plans will  be at eve vegas and fan fest bext year
---
Yes. So EVE is a little different than IRL espionage, in EVE instead of spending time trying to recruit potential spy’s, people just make an alt account and will be the spy themselves. 
---
They’ll join an enemy Corp and gather intel and report back to their main alliance. 
---
This is the primary reason for SP minimums in order to join a Corp, it forces potential spy’s to pay an initial “investment” in order to get in. And the more SP you require the more ISK needs to be laundered into the account. 
---
Recruiters and Corp HR directors use your ESI to scourer through your assets/contract history/market history/wallet history to see anything suspicious.

---
two of them have cynos
---
Yeah, it's important to remember what WiS was and why it happened. The only way they could have made it meaningful was force a different not-EVE game into EVE, and most of us would rather they just put that effort into updating EVE.
---
Being able to get out of my ship and have a sense of scale was amazing. It would have been even better if we could have hung out with our space friends in a space bar watching ships dock and undock. But I'd rather have a balance pass and new spaceships than maintenance of technical debt.

---
&gt; 2. Remove supers from FW space by making them unable to jump to a cyno or take a gate into FW space
---
I like this idea a lot, it's a nice middle ground between the current state and the 'ban all caps' calls which would be just a bit much. It also does make some sense lore-wise (I know, lolrp, but it's still nice to have the game universe make sense) - if the empires can ban things like bombs, bubbles, etc in lowsec and have it stick, why would they allow those insane loose cannon capsuleers to operate the equivalent of nuclear weapons in their space?
---
The only potential problem that comes to mind is the impact on capital travel. Anyone more familiar with the routes capitals usually take around the universe than me able to chime in with how badly this would cripple the ability to get from nullsec point A to nullsec point B?
---
&gt; 3. Remove ventures stab core role bonus = no more of that "offensive" plexing overnight with ventures
---
Just disallow ventures from taking acceleration gates - we know they can do that, they're a separate category of ship from regular t1 frigs - or if possible make it so that being on the beacon in a ship with more than 1 point of warp core stability doesn't tick down the timer. 
---
&gt; 5. Make it so citadels that dont belong to the faction's FW system consume 50% more fuel, have no asset safety and have no tethering = encourages fighting for the system
---
In addition to this, completely disallow characters in FW from docking or tethering at any citadel in a system owned by the opposing faction, regardless of who owns the citadel. Between the two of these changes, this would require you to actually capture the system again to stage there. (Though leave asset safety in; this continues the old status quo of your stuff simply getting locked away and having to be firesold rather than all going poof, which is a bit much. You want to *encourage* participation in FW, not scare people away.)
---
&gt; 6. Make it so FW moons are mined by NPC industrials from one faction passively ...The NPC industrials can be attacked and destroyed by the enemy faction to steal the ore and reduce the enemy's passive income, so they can trigger fights.
---
This makes perfect sense and is a great idea. (I assume by 'FW moons' you mean 'a moon with a refinery on it owned by a FW entity that is actively pulling up chunks', I also assume this would require system ownership.) It should of course not return as much ore as actual players mining it (i.e. once the field is gone you'd only end up with some fraction of the total ore deposited in the refinery's holds), but it'd take the busywork out of it and would be a great incentive to actually participate in FW and capture the systems.
---
The big question, of course, is how you stop big non-FW groups from just dropping a refinery with a FW alt corp and reaping the passive rewards without actually investing in the FW system. My first instinct is to tie the NPC mining  rate/ore return to some measure of FW activity by the owning corp/alliance in some way. Something like the maximum ore returned per unit time depends on total LP earned/opposing faction ships killed/whatever by the owning alliance in the past week/month/etc - i.e. the empires won't devote ships to support a corp that isn't actively supporting *them*. The cap on ore return would be a shared cap across *all* refineries owned by the corp/alliance - this would mean that you could set the bar for 'high enough cap to fully utilize one refinery' at a low enough amount that a small corp could run one moon, without allowing a large entity to do a trivial amount of work to run a zillion moons.
---
Can anyone think of a way to break this system?
---
GojoSuzi did a decent job replying to your point 2, I did my PI moving-stuff run, and frankly, with the method I have outlined above where planets do P0 to P1 to P2 before you move it (even accounting for excess P1 that needs to move), Gallente Industrial I is totally sufficient. After picking up from 9 extraction -&gt; P2 planets (with some P1 mixed in there), I was only using about 24,000 m3 of space in my Epithal. With Gallente Industrial I, you get 49,500 m3 of cargo, far more than sufficient space if you do your PI the way I described.
---
Of course, if your style is more "P0 to P1 on every extraction planet, move stuff every day to a factory planet," then yes, you may need the extra space, but for the purposes I outlined, you don't need to spend the extra day or so training it up to IV. 
---
it's the title

cry more

Maybe they are trying to get the value of the Komodo back.

Pretty sure I wasn't crying, just pointing our the irony

bruh moment

or have the actual state militias give out limited amounts of free shit to fw people 
---
It's to the point where we aren't even phased by being dropped on. It's not if anymore it's when. It's just the norm now and your offense shifts from attempting to kill your target to shit talking from the relative safety of your WH. You get called a, "pussy or a coward" for not whelping your sub caps to supers and titans, or told, "what did you expect..." We reply in kind with expletives and usually pretty amazing burns about past events in the alliances history we had nothing to do with. We rinse and we repeat.
---
&gt;Make it so citadels that dont belong to the faction's FW system consume 50% more fuel
---
people will just offset it by upgrading to faction fortizars #nopoors

woof... that's a bit much tbh

I don’t have to provide you anything. Ccp doesn’t acknowledge 90% of exploits they ban people for. So go ahead and use it. Then you can mail pelligro about how you got wrongly banned and he can print your mail straight into the shredder.

"4.  Make it so you can only plex in systems next to each other = a formal battleline will mean more battles, tactics to advance in the map and more content overall since there are more pilots in system "  
---
Holy shit! That just fixed FW.
---
Depends on what. If it’s anything related to capital production, you want to steer clear from Jita as most of that is incredibly overpriced compared to null. 
---
could you clarify your suggestion for me please?
---
I would say it's capitals in general, not just supercapitals, that need to be banned from FW space.
---
IMO tbh both should be banned, but let's not kid ourselves into thinking that HAW dreads have not been a problem for FW space. 
---
Did they specify what top 1% is judged on? Are we talking isk in wallet? Asset value? Kills?
---
They could also just make it so supers can't launch fighters/target in FW lowsec if travel is deemed too important.
---
Basically exactly the same as the VNI fit. 
---
To be honest you might as well just use a VNI. The only differences between the two are the Ishtar gets slightly better tracking on the drones and gets a much much better tank. Damage is exactly the same otherwise. 
---
The ishtar is 2-3x the cost too so unless you plan on blinging it out to run escalations like the maze which the Ishtar can do if fit properly then I would just stick with the VNI. 
---
Has potential, but the race crap sinks it fast. Change the race/culture thing into an in-game equivalent and it's not bad

If thats true then thats really sad. Simple changes that can revitalize a large part of the game.
---
&gt; Remove supers from FW space by making them unable to jump to a cyno or take a gate into FW space
---
Liked and Subscribed.
---
&gt; Remove ventures stab core role bonus = no more of that "offensive" plexing overnight with ventures
---
Treating the symptoms not the cause.
---
What is needed is commitment, if getting out of the plex means you lose the time you just spent there, people won't fly a Venture and might be more willing to fight.
---
&gt; Make it so you can only plex in systems next to each other = a formal battleline will mean more battles, tactics to advance in the map and more content overall since there are more pilots in system
---
Based and Red-pilled.
---
&gt; Make it so citadels that dont belong to the faction's FW system consume 50% more fuel, have no asset safety and have no tethering = encourages fighting for the system
---
Balancing with Fuel is akin to Balancing with ISK, those concerned will laugh their way to the bank and it's everyone else that will be affected.
---
Outright ban them and force all Structures to align. This will put the influence of structures back into FW hands and compensate for structures bypassing the station lockout system. Once again, you have to stage out from adjacent allied systems.
---
I think your calculations must be wrong, because I produce the equivalent of 2/3 of a P4 every hour using only two characters (9 extraction + 1 factory, as outlined above). Perhaps maybe you're right and it's a diminishing returns thing (or your increased cycle time really nerfs your extraction), but I would encourage you to double check those numbers.

Oh, hell yeah!    Some thoughts:
---
3-- battle ventures are a fun and sneaky way to get kills.
---
5--or maybe they need those "starbase charter" things and make them only available at FW LP store.
---
6--Eve players will find a way to game this. And we already do get paid--in LP.
---
7--"Buh-but that means I can't snipe new players in my blingy orthrus! Mommy!"
---
8--If they automatically get added they will get killed in HS by griefers without knowing what is going on. I like the idea though.
---
10-- Galmil isn't renting. :P
---
Scrublord btw
---
Do you not see this is why your thread was a dumbass idea?
---
defenders who cant/wont defend their own structure (80% of HS based war eligible corps) are going to be out shooting HQ's? you think?
---
Most Null groups will remove them if they can be bothered chasing timers over HS, but it will still take 5-12 days depending on timers and when the war was placed. Over time the attacker's will learn who shows up and who doesn't.  
---
I think groups like pirat and anyone who wants to do wars will just rotate their wars into 2-4  cheap HQ's they put up with no intention of defending. To maximize their available targets in jita. so the north for 10 days then the south for 10 then the east for 10 then a mix of whats left to decc for 10 and just cycle through each month to keep targets and isk flowing.
---
I think if CCP see wars as something they need to "fix" then the larger groups CCP pointed to as being the issue at eve Vegas, who have no real reason to decc half the HS/WH/null if they rarely leave jita. Would be something on the roadmap to address. I don't see suspect logi or HQ's as being an answer to that.
---
Any known exploits are officially advised of by CCP.  If something is an exploit they will announce it on the known exploit page and you will get banned for doing it.  Not on the page, not an exploit.  Simple.
---
good ideas, also just disallow citadel anchoring in fw space alltogether imo

---
&gt;Remove supers from FW space by making them unable to jump to a cyno or take a gate into FW space
---
I argued against banning all caps in another recent FW thread because there are actually a fair number of cap pilots in FW who I think would be pressured to leave by that change.  I don't think banning supers would have nearly as much negative impact simply bc there are far fewer Supercap pilots in FW.    
---
Obviously, banning supercaps would have a major impact on the combat environment in FW space, and would significantly even the playing field between typical FW groups vs pirates / null groups with major supercap fleets.  It'd be a big nerf to the ability of those established groups to project power in lowsec, and a major plus to FW groups so it would definitely be controversial.    
---
There'd also be potential for a significant influx of players into FW space from other areas in EVE who have been disaffected by supercap proliferation.   
---
Another issue that hasn't been brought up so far is the impact of not having Titan bridge capability in losec anymore.  
---
&gt;Make it so you can only plex in systems next to each other = a formal battleline will mean more battles, tactics to advance in the map and more content overall since there are more pilots in system
---
I like the goal of concentrating pvp, but I think this change is too restrictive because it removes too many strategic options for targeting systems.  I think a better change would be to have a bonus mechanic to encourage more players to fight in the "front line" systems, rather than a penalty that disallows players from fighting in other systems.
---
&gt;Remove ventures stab core role bonus = no more of that "offensive" plexing overnight with ventures
---
Ventures should keep their stab bonus, because that's a key feature of the ship for its intended new player / mining demographic.  They could even continue to be allowed to enter a plex, they just shouldn't be able to run the timer.  That's what CCP should have done with all stabs, actually, and implementing the change that way wouldn't have broken gate sliding.  
---
In general, I think the other changes that you suggest are good to the extent that they provide more gameplay options to players, and bad to the extent that they restrict them.  
---
Secure container? Or what do you mean 
---
I mean, what do you expect when they are advertisements for alliances like Ranger Regiment who are full of bots. vOv

This will almost certainly blow up in a tournament setting where you literally are just looped videos of that back in the big blocs complain about lack of PLEX on a wh too long or i get plex or let this man/girl fly thru Jovian space and a slight decompression of ratting and mining alongside their ratters or just ask in the way down to as low as 70% from what I've seen.
---
You’re not wrong to ask this question. The gameplay issue is there’s no meaningful ‘edge’ to the region of space they control - it’s either inside umbrella, in which case you get turboblobbed, or it’s outside, in which case you don’t find anything to catch beyond botter/afk VNI, most of which get safe immediately, and aren’t challenging or meaningful targets anyway.
---
The ability to control held space should fray as you get to the edge of it, which is the state CCP are trying to reach by tuning anom spawn rates. This eventually will mean that smaller groups can engage in more hit and run or guerrilla style gameplay at your outskirts, while not being able to meaningful contest your heartlands, as you are forced to spread out from a unified capital umbrella.
---
I remember back in the eighties when you could walk up to a complete stranger and say "Can I bum a fag?". Probably get arrested for that now.
---
Input Broadcasting used to be legit.  I don't think Nolak has done incursions in several years now.
---
&gt; I would get further though, ban all Caps and have FW space be a space that focuses around subcaps.
---
So you want a good part of low-sec to be a special instanced arena? Stupid.
---
And in before the "you don't know how it is man", I spent years in FW, it was great, the botters are a pain, the supercap edgelords will always be around (now Snuff, then PL). We fixed it back then by doing the [first dreadbomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U0dTlU-QUg) in game.
---
Fix it so the plexes call for more then stabbed shitfits, make sure they're all gated, so edgelords can't get into them, and you'll have FW FC's innovating again, if pirates come in, take the fight on the gate if need be or get out and regroup, with the gates you'll be safe from the caps and supers inside.
---
FW was great when it was open to everyone and plexes were not run by hordes of bots in minimum isk frigates. FW gave any active pilot access to good enough isk making opportunities that they could be in any ship the FC called for, and it gave them fights to be had whenever you logged on. That bling and action in turn attracted the sharks, to combat them people innovated, the first [pipe bomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZ0EcsneSg) was also in FW, years before RnK made it a thing.
---
The fixing of botters, and ensuring that citadels having a greater fuel cost (or requiring extra starbase charters) for anyone not participating in that factions FW is a good idea, rest not so much.
---
Welcome to 2019. If you aren't being called a Nazi you're doing something wrong.

extracting covers about 85% of the cost.  if you run lazy PI or do research you cover the rest passively.

even if you don't, you are only out 300M or so which is pretty easy to cover these days.

&gt; Make it so FW moons are mined by NPC industrials from one faction passively = before every retards REEEEEE and tells me how mining is fun and cool, think about this. FW alliances can now afford better srp programs for their members and have a way of funding themselves without doing the most autistic shit in this game. This will mean more ships and more content. The NPC industrials can be attacked and destroyed by the enemy faction to steal the ore and reduce the enemy's passive income, so they can trigger fights.

Also, why don't FW factions have diamond NPCs running around fighting each other? Players could hop in to "random encounters" of NPCs ganking each other's cargo ships, patrols, VIP civilians, etc., and join one side or the other (and then opposing PvPers show up and so on).

You don't need a group to have fun in WHs. You can fairly easily setup solo in a WH. You can also do what we do in WHs and use them as hunting grounds, never actually living anywhere. We have some great videos of what you can do [here](https://www.youtube.com/wingspantt). You can also get some good fights roaming around in LS, or by hunting in FW. The stakes are generally low but if you are more interested in fights then KMs, its a great place to go. Finally, if you ever feel that solo PvP is dead, just look at what [this guy](https://zkillboard.com/character/90519767/) is doing.

Give wormholes a try, but I'd recommend joining a fairly well established group rather than some fairly new one as you'll hate it if you're often online alone.

All three are big enough that you won't be the only guy online, fairly well known and great for newcomers to wh space.

If you're not playing with a group and being social this game is probably trash compared to any other game. You can do things solo, but you need a group you like or you'll quit/waste your time.

Geminate. 
---
Pandemic Horde is a new player alliance with a culture of fighting anyone who comes by, mostly in small ships.
---
Sounds like what you're looking for.
---
They always bring a fight and stick to subcaps, I have a lot of respect for them.
---
Yup. When players become part of the story.
---
Some of these are good, and I'll put them on my list. Sliding was talked about last summit, and I don't think it's coming back. I like the citadel suggestion the most. 
---
Ahh.. Sorry. I take it back then.
---
You can't have played many mmos then. At least in Eve you don't get RSI doing it like in WoW, Runescape or many others. 
---
TLDR, Unspoken unable to beat renters after 3 weeks of effort, call goons for a 330 man backup fleet.
---
Idk about sticking to subcaps entirely but when they do bring caps it's usually reasonable 
---
The weird thing is that it was never this bad with secure containers. This current trend of a dozen+ items on every gate is new.
---
I don't know/recall if that's because the anchoring restrictions were so strict (CCP kicked GSCs out of 0.8 and higher), or if pilots just generally were better behaved.
---
And yes, Moonpire needs to go. That many depots in one location is a real performance hog.
---
unspoken have spent 3 weeks trying to take it from renters and have failed.... needing to call goons for backup... against renters. 
---
I dunno, you guys sounded pretty beat to me

The one thing HS wardec folks are good at is giving some funny as fuck salt when they eat shit.

Per #7 - if someone is too lazy or too dumb to d-scan plex before warping at 0 they deserve to die. If plex is out of d-scan range they should use a ping. Why should eve allow perfect safety for someone that fails to take basic precausions?
---
That little super fleet on the right? Yea, that's just four people and their alts...
---
Protip: if you win you get to be smug, if you lose you get to be salty. So what your saying is that you won the timer but lost somehow?
---
This is for the "Elite Player", not all EVE players.
---
I mean, you guys have the protection of NCdot and Unspoken is a 253 character alliance.
---
So I can easily flip it and say renters couldn't handle some horny USTZ boys and called in Nancy.
---
Horde has no participation requirements and offer all types of pvp and pve. Good casual group, doable without comms. I imagine brave is a similarly oriented, but maybe more tight knit. That or maybe a low-sec space 
---
Swtor, eso, gw2. Pve you do something. Mining is just nothing.
---
Mining isn't the only way to make isk. You can run sites too. 
---
Just as boring. The only non boring pve in eve are abyssals in 3 man frigs. But it shouldnt be like that. It should be fun.

Rvb is  good place to learn pvp. You don't find a noob friendly area for pvp. For that eve is the wrong game

---
we're also gay

Rvb?
---
You're ruining a good post with asking for fw specific passive income because PvE is boring. I don't enjoy wh PvE but it pays for my PvP, it doesn't mean I should get passive income from npc miners. 
---
No they are renters, I'm not trying to diminish the efforts of the defence side, but the reality is that B0T can't defend with unspoken and Goons.  
---
plot twist: everyone is so big ships spawn more than 10 mins or so

BTW The best way to inflate someones system index (aka cheapest/effect) would be Nanofiber Internal Structure I
---
Wormhole space is great. Expensive to live in there alone, but pretty easy to find friends. Most corps in wormholes that I've taken part in have no mandatory requirements except the standard comms for organized fleets/roams etc. - if you're just managing PI or trying to get duels / solo ganks nobody would bother you.
---
You are diverting too much. Fw alliances should be able to earn isk by controlling fw exclusive stuff right? Ok c5 dread running is good and all and i do it too but we are talking abkut fw.
---
dont worry i got 60mil sp and im total shite
---
yeah no kidding, but the point that im trying to make is that unspoken had to fight against B0T with (potential) Nancy backup as a reasonable expectation. So if they batphoned a goon sig then \o/ 
---
Mine would be a player named Brisc Rubal. He's on mumble and everytime a question is posed and I craft a response he chimes in first. His responses are articulate, intelligent and a cross between Ghandi, Mr Rodgers and Abe Lincoln.

Compared to his insight on damn near everything my response would sound like a donkey having a stroke at a polka dance party.
---
CCP needs to nerf this OP person.
---
I'm not diverting. The alliances make money from taxes on bounties in all areas, encourage the players to run sites if that's an issue. Just giving alliances free isk is an awful idea. 
---
Here's a great example of Triage carriers. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFahR4wXTg

Its not free isk. You need to setup the drill, defend it, defend the npcs.

Goon was there weeks before the QuietGame Coalition have lauch this sov offensive. We are now merely sharing the same target and our presence is helping them to focus on other objective in the region and obviously increasing the damage around.
---
Next time , when you are invadingsome small alliances with 500ish fleets guys , don't cry if it ended up dragging other big guys around in the name of opportunities and content.
---
Just undock and fight.
---
You're the hero we need
---
&gt;be peaceful wormholer (of peace) btw
---
lol good one
---
take my upvote and buy yourself some candy you sly bastard 
---
at least they didn't fit the wrong rigs.
---
wait i thought brave didnt throw caps around in catch :D
---
&gt; the average snuff edgelord wont be able to get his micropenis erect by dropping a ragnarok on a 10 man merlin fleet while reading manga with a katana in one of his hands and disproving the bible on reddit using the other.
---
Spicy. Now hy will come for you. 
---
Weird flex but OK. 
---
Please no supers and meaningful battlelines...please brisky, pleeeeease. Thanks for noting anything at all, though. 
---
amendment: anything that can be spammed should not have reinforcement timers
---
did you notice the other word I used
---
I think the no supers thing is a very good idea - I'd like no caps at all, help make lowsec the subcap PvP area, but I know that's a stretch. 
---
The citadel thing is huge, though, and anything that results in less asset safety is good in my book. 
---
Isn't Unspoken like 80% EUTZ?
---
Agreed, take my doots sir. 
---
Really? I think it's handy for what it is. Why are they removing it?
---
This. You're gonna have to post something. 
---
Why is this it's own thread instead of a comment in another thread or otherwise include source material
---
Agency is a steaming pile of shite.
---
this bot needs to be put out of its misery
---
That's what keyboard shortcuts are for. Anyone who opens the market window by clicking an icon is a bad player and should feel bad about their life choices.
---
Alt-R, ya scrubs.
---
The only reason I have any icons at all on my neocom is so I can see them flash when there's an update.
---
I thought a majority of the main corp was ustz
---
i play the game to pvp and have fun. Spending time doing "lazy PI" or making extra income just to maintain alts that i don't need isn't worth it to me.
---
Vaga doesnt need more mids... Well it could do with another but it already has great resists and the tank bonus is great and mitigates that. 
---
Whats more efficient than Phantasms?
---
Its understandable, when you can't fight the big boys you just fuck with the smaller guys you can bully, sound familiar? As for undocking, all entities in eve are guilty of blue balling. unspoken has done it, b0t, etc, etc, the reality is that people don't just go and feed if they know it will be one. B0T does not have well rounded pvpers to join fleets, they don't have the same organized pvp output like unspoken and friends do, and you know this. 
---
As for NC. no one but them can comment and speak on their behalf. What happens next time will tell, but what is true is that its taken unspoken a lot of effort to get to where they are now. Now that goons have a stronghold in the region, I'm expecting them to fuck with B0T space  and there is no doubt, unspoken and friends will have goons carry them to victory if possible. 
---
Have you seen those pings? Half the fleets end up in two difference systems due to spelling errors
---
Unspoken are more US tz than Euro.
---
But the rest of the coalition members are largely euros.
---
No. Never.  
---
Send me 5bil isk and I'll double the loot drop.
---
I really like the battline idea
---
i don't have a problem with bots
---
i have a problem with the status quo making bots pure money machines
---
in a true, working open world sandbox bots should be in an environment with enough randomness to where a player can deal with them.
---
local makes botting too profitable 
---
medium structures = only 1 timer, 36-48 hours away
---
large structures = 2 timers, one 24 hours away, and one 36-48 hours away
---
keepstars = as currently.
---
Ragnarok (*imagine the cuts and scratches...*)
---
Damn highsec peasants. You would think that they would have all purple from their botting super alts.
---
NCs members probably didn't notice when she didn't actually ping them. It's not exactly difficult to put a spy in NC and provide proof instead of having to make up lies to push a narrative most people don't even give a shit about.
---
Seems you can make any old shite up and paint it as true if you say allegedly, allegedly.
---
ill stop complaining when I can kill them without some bubble-logoff trick
---
I'm struggling to optimize my skill training for PvE/Pvp character. I have 5 million on a character I've returned to, can fly BCs but not well.
---
Currently working on my Lvl3 mastery of the Rupture. Should I continue using mastery/certificates for the ships I want to fly to ensure I'm training smart? 
---
&gt; Vaga doesnt need more mids...
---
Stick a prop mod, large cap battery and a web or comp in there, all you're left with is invuln. And its got 2 rig slots on top of that cause its a HAC.
---
Whats more efficient then Phantasm ? Gila, Ishtar, Sac, Cerb, Vedmak. And we'll see how the upcoming Trig HAC will perform, Vedmak does pretty well so the HAC version of it might end up real nice unless CCP fucks it up.

I don't want a fresh start, I have years of subs behind me, I already "started over" coming back after so long and reestablishing my rep with a corp.
---
Starting the universe over flys in the face of what eve is, If ccp for story or tech reasons really need to shift the game, there are several apocalypse type scenarios that could happen, eve-gate activity, W477-P supernova, that they could get rid of "legacy code" in one fell swoop if they needed to, but it would be part of the story and persistent universe.
---
Unspoken, Just a Game and Bow dow.

Small coalition are a thing.

Nothing to screenshot, LS never pinged.
---
Always a pleasure to see high sec campers dying.
---
This is good work. I totally agree with your conclusions
---
I had to take my blood pressure meds after being exposed to all of the salt you have produced.
---
please, try harder
---
Please show a video of you multiboxing. I feel like theyre just super accounts who cycle once every 15 mins in a tidi-fest :P
---
I want sentencing before the fact. That will show them all.
---
Thanks, that was super helpful.
---
Just Delete High-Sec.
---
People tank retrievers?
---
Oh lol. That explains why manual piloting seemed so hard for me. I clicked XD
---
I guess they realised that it's easier to kill someone who's testing something/figuring stuff out than to actually play in the real sandbox.
---
why is the hand black exactly
---
Well, I have my main, titan/dread alt, two fax/dread alts, JF alt, multiple cynos, Jita alt, Ganking alt, and one guy I havne't figured out what to do with yet. 
---
TLDR NC. unable to beat Unspoken alone batphones Phorde and PL to come help them. Surprised when Goons show up.
---
to me what he was saying is Unspoken is like a 200-300 man alliance and they were getting blobbed.  They looked around for some friends and found them, now the other side is complaining about getting blobbed.
---
11. Make it so there is a 2 week delay after leaving one faction before joining another. 
---
Now your attitude makes sense. You're one of those TDS suffering lefty losers
---
when you get blobbed by a bunch of krabs that feed you alot, why would you complain?
---
Damn this is genius! 
---
so... if you get space... you think you will have it for long time?  
---
Cant understand that... Goons will not be there to save your ass IF something happen.
---
But thank you for the content we will have soon :-)

Its alot easier than right click + select jump.

man it must really suck not to be able to find any risk free ganks after you get through running all the sites in your unassailable jump-capable staging system and decide to reattach it back to the rest of the game for a bit
---
won't someone think of the wormholers btw?
---
Sweetheart, I did read the question. Did you? The question was *"What is your biggest pet peeve with EVE?"*
---
We didnt start going for The Spire until NC hit our fort...so its been like 5 days? And ihubs are already roasted.
---
\#ComeuppanceforCamal
---
mad? were laughing our asses off that the pvp alliances that invaded renters had to call for backup. Nc/horde have yet to get involved in the spire
---
We're mainly afk :D
---
nice bait
---
*whoooooosh*
---
Oof. I get up to get lunch and see this on reddit. 
---
I too brag about failing objectives !
---
Villy on suicide watch 👀
---
Running C1-C3 wormhole data/relic sites in a T1 explo frigate pays quite well. Be prepared for losses but you should make more than you lose.
---
yeah ramjags and permajamming falcons and 90% web rapiers are fun
---
You need to tell TNT to stop feeding
---
Well ... you cannot say that he didn't motivate Snuff to do it }:&gt;
---
It's been in Stain for months. They tried to drop it on a bunch of our supers back around Christmas, but I wasnt retarded and had scouts out. 
---
about 150 dreads.....yikes
---
Begone botter.
---
You're really not wrong. Even when I'm doing stuff on my own, I still shit up comms with corpmates and having a good time. It's totally possible to do things on your own in this game and have absolutely no social interaction, but I feel like you're just completely avoiding what makes this game so great.
---
agency have a map?
---
There are many more dread bombs in Stain. Some waiting for years.      
---
I am glad that first group to utilize one it is from Lowsec.             
---
#IMAGINE CCP ... GATE FROM LOWSEC TO STAIN               
---
yeah i mean pirat might be a bunch of risk averse docker up pussylords but is a single prot km really postworthy, much less two of those golden stars you pay actual rl cash for afaik
---
i think so not
---
like it isnt even an up and comer group, it's literally an upstanding and well organized horde shooting squad armed with 1400mm hurlers
---
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
HELLO VILY
---
Hard to average it but if you get less than 20m in a wormhole relic site you have been unlucky. I once pulled a 105m module out of a wh data site(that was an outlier most data sites are pretty sucky unless you want/need stuff for research).
---
NO! Really?! Fascinating...
---
13 alts? 7 years? If that's true (and I think it is), less than 100,000 real people have ever subbed this game
---
Gobbled last of the Sunday roast, logged on EVE, Grabbed a dread, jumped, ... siege red - siege red, .. popped some sub-caps.. but missed the dread slaughter 
---
Good effort, but still a failing grade... The second line, which is a qualification of the scope of the question says "The thing that didn't affect the game in any way..."
---
Currently:
---
* -2 titans ([Erebus](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75869263/)/[Avatar](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75869395/))
---
* -5 supers ([Hel](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75869277/), [Hel](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75869312/), [Hel](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75869315/), [Hel](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75869340/), [Hel](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75869426/))
---
You could get dreads pretty cheap in Stain.        
---
One of the 'EX' FC's from SW stole a bigger part of dread cache and is still selling it slowly.             
---
There should be also NC dread bomb sitting in T8 ... didn't see it moving (just btw). 
---
How common are they in class 1-3 wormholes?
---
Is it one per wormhole, two per wormhole?"
---
Now imagine if the Fax nerfs were live.
---
hi Vily!
---
I fully agree with structured skill plans. 
---
I dont fuckin know my dude im not the komodo pilot go harass him :P 
---
&gt; Just disallow ventures from taking acceleration gates - we know they can do that, they're a separate category of ship from regular t1 frigs - or if possible make it so that being on the beacon in a ship with more than 1 point of warp core stability doesn't tick down the timer.
---
I thought large plexes don't have gates and that's where ventures are mostly whoring.

Hi Vily
---
Unspoken taking the early Iron Armada  advice.  "We are totally a independent group!"  As we watch goonies come  back them up.  Also jesus Hyper bud I get it you're still salty over drones we get it.
---
could honestly be safe and say there will be millions of dreads in any npc region lol
---
gf though
---
I mean have you not seen the scale of the frt botters?
---
Gf provi
---
Who's Camal?

Also, Nyx was never in danger.

Just a line member my dude, wasn't even in test during the Geminate deployment. 
---
It's a low effort meme
---
If this is "try hard" to you, get yourself chemically castrated so you can't propagate your genetics.
---
i think the argument is more along the lines of, "ccp should make it so you cant stop us from farming your miners"
---
and just try explaining that ccp's been trying to set up the feed for years but it's actually pretty hard to incentivize people to sit there and get owned to a wormholer mid-tantrum
---
We've owned most of ER for 2 years. Not super worried
---
Man, I remember when DEQC was the corp to be in for fun fights. Times change I guess. It's all about protecting the krabs now.
---
[https://imgur.com/gFArJpr](https://imgur.com/gFArJpr) Barely survived that one!! OH hardners and didn't triage on jump after hearing they were primarying faxes now. GF!
---
So seems like Provi has actually a couple of pilots who like unlocking non-PVE fit ships. If you are one of them and want to roll with a fun crew who actually fuck (IG and IRL) you should get in touch with WAFFLES recruitment because your leadership is gaypwnd.
---
I hear they've mostly moved to ASIC miners these days.
---
GF Villy 
---
Stay blasted lol
---
Mastery level are pretty bad to follow. You should work toward having most skills to level 4 (shield, medium gun, support skill, gunnery ones). Then you should work getting toward T2 guns and shield modules.
---
Sadly Stain became cut off from moving a dread bomb quietly after all changes over the years.           
---
Sad.

presumably kicked for being stupid, but the point is that i was hunting for you people on gates for WEEKS after that and nobody was there.

perhaps if things are different these days, as you claim, when i eventually resub in the autumn i'll bring the fight
---
blyat
---
Looks like a Hel of a good time was had by snuff.
---
Fun times, TY for the kills :)
---
Btw this [thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b4hnq8/no_superstitan_death_since_319_eve_is_dead/) didn't age so well.
---
&gt;Make it so FW moons are mined by NPC industrials from one faction passively = before every retards REEEEEE and tells me how mining is fun and cool, think about this. FW alliances can now afford better srp programs for their members and have a way of funding themselves without doing the most autistic shit in this game. This will mean more ships and more content. The NPC industrials can be attacked and destroyed by the enemy faction to steal the ore and reduce the enemy's passive income, so they can trigger fights.
---
I really like this idea, but I would personally elaborate on it. Make FW moons *only* mineable by NPC industrials.  While they're mining, rats continually spawn and kill the industrials and players need to protect them. At any time enemy FW players can come in and steal the ore. Anyone participating on grid gets LP, the owner of the structure gets a percentage of the ore while the rest "goes to" your faction.
---
F
---
nice :)
---
That was fast. 
---
So now you're saying that 13 year olds can consent?
---
Wew fucking lad. Get some help, sicko.
---
that was the most fun ive ever had in eso holy fuck
---
good fucking fight guys
---
finally dread alt used properly o7
---
Fuck Snuff?
---
Revenge for what?
---
So its east vs west now?
---
8 hels now
---
Funny that you prag here how much better provi did with 50 more ppl in fleet :P Nice spinning!
---
I was specifically referring to "Villy, Ego Man, Fluffer of Panfam, First of his Name, Ruler of the Dreddit Men Lord of Esoteria"
---
It's odd because it's simultaneously low effort and trying to hard.
---
I guess hy sends his regards to vily?
---
tl;dr
---
Whose the bundle of sticks now?
---
Never mind already SRPed.
---
One thing hardly anyone mentions but IMO is the most broken part of FW is how the plex timers work.
---
Right now the timers actively discourage PVP and competition. When you chase someone in the opposing faction out of a plex it now takes longer than before to complete the plex as you have to undo all of their work; and at the end you usually get a smaller reward because you are defensively plexing. 
---
Therefore, the optimal way to play FW plexs is to ignore any plex being run by an enemy and go and find your own plex. This is also why botters and farmers are so present in the warzone, since no one actually bothers to steal other people's plexs.
---
Remove offensive and defensive plexs just make everything pay the same as offensive, make the warzone slighly smaller and make the timer so that you steal other's progress rather than having to undo it. 
---
ALl the changes in the OP are good but IMO without changes to the actual plex mechanics FW will still be overrun by farmers and botters.
---
It's good we have super SRP
---
Thanks for the content!
---
Nice karma whoring.
---
Initiative appears to be on the wrong side of the br
---
At least give us an AAR

Vily drops the *fa-word* on Snuff.

Snuff turns around and drops mega dread bomb on Esoteria.

lmao fuck tapi

Talk shit get hit retards.
---
But props to the elite hel pilots for doing PVP in their shield supers. Rest of TAPI is too cowardly to do PVP
---
They moved them there from Delve while still blue to goons
---
The Tibetans will be pissed when they find out.
---
Step 1. Talk about it in the meetings
---
Wtf? Nothing that account posts is even sensical. 
---
Commit toaster bath.
---
good reality check what happens when u drop in range of known dreadbomb lmao
---
AAR:
---
Vily backstabbed INIT to try to get back at Snuff.
---
In other news, Inner Hell caught 6 TEST Rorqs in Esoteria. TEST formed capitals and some supers to clear the grid.  They jumped their ships in and dribs and drabs, not knowing that Snuffed and others were waiting for their response.
---
Two titans jumped in along with a handful of FAXes and the trap was set. As the Rorqs were tackled, INIT was reffing the jump beacon in M-0 (hi NC.) and had a wormhole connection that would take us to a sekrit POS titan bridge that got us within 4 jumps of system.
---
By that point, the fight was fully engaged, with Volta, Snuffed and a bunch of others killing everything they could. One Erebus was down and two Hels.
---
When INIT cynoed in, an Avatar, a handful of faxes and dreads, and another 7 Hels got blowed up. 
---
Everybody had a good time, I lost some votes, Mueller cleared Trump of collusion, and INIT moonwalked out with minimal losses.
---
Clearly...
---
CVA looking scary god damn!
---
its like boasting about beating provi in a fight, lots of people beat them but only the attention whores brag about it
---
Oh I know there are more. I was speaking to this particular one.
---
Is this the first time we see the effects of fax+supercap nerf?
---
Talk shit, get hit.
---
Make it impossible to anchor depots in high sec gate grids.
---
It depends if some other explorer has already been there recently. Sometimes you might go 5 wormholes without seeing one. Then like a couple of weeks ago you discover a site with 9 relic sites and 7 data sites. Manage to run them all and leave the wormhole with 470m ISK.
---
If yoiu aren't familiar with wormholes and/or exploration read up on it before you scan one down and jump into it(many good tutorials on YT and at Eve University). There are major differences like the fact there is no local channel so you have no idea if you're alone or sharing the hole with 200 other people. Most important thing in a wormhole is learning to hit that dscan button as if you were a laboratory mouse with an electrode connected to the pleasure centre of your brain.
---
roam delve, they only have miners and ratters
---
Wtf I love snuff now
---
Well that kind of a “gate” from stain isn’t it? Hahaha
---
They always bring respect and stick to fights, I have a lot of subcaps for them.
---
96.2% Kill ratio is hardly mediocre.  
---
Okay. Got any fits I should use?
---
(I’m an Alpha and use Gallente ships btw
---
lol
---
yeh
---
Someone is also buying off dreads in Stain.
---
On one hand, I agree with you
---
On the other hand... I’m not exactly a veteran, so why are people complaining about them?(I’m genuinely curious)
---
He was joking. In Delve they drop titans and supers at every gate.
---
You just don't go there
---
!remind me 1year
---
Oh lol
---
trying to bring renting into FW, dirty null-seccer :P
---
Getting there was SUCH a pain the le bum! &gt;__&lt;
---
Because they are isk printing machines and CCP's limited attempts over the years to combat them has done nothing to stop them as the issue and the number of botters has only increased over time.
---
If the team that would make walk in stations is the same team that makes "balances" and new ships (angel capitals when?) then our stations would be the most chaotic thing in the world. 
---
Only a character can have LP, I do not believe a corp can have any LP.
---
Yes, this is annoying for many reasons, one of which is asking members to donate their LP to keep system levels upgraded.
---
" How much extra work would there be for the player base to maintain the current economy? "   
---
That's the kind of thing a botter would say
---
Was anything of value lost?
---
I am pretty sure people knew there was a test dreadbomb in position, just people need to be stupid sometimes. On the plus side, I got a hy wanto corpse \\o/
---
Can anybody decipher this block of concentrated autism?
---
&gt;who actually fuck

boys i assume?

^(Good to see Provi willing to get into a fight.....I was worried after the night before when they docked up in fear of fighting us on their Keepstar.)   
---
Stay classy Provi
---
thats what she said!
---
Lol at all those ratting hels
---
Masteries are a decent guide, but not perfect. Particularly mastery V which will have you training specialization skills to V is generally not a good use of time. A good place to start is the [Magic 14](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Magic_14). Basically train up ships enough that you can fly something that you will have some fun it or can use to make ISK, then focus on getting your fitting, tanking, and weapon support skills to IV. From there just train into things you want to use such as particular ships or T2 gun, and slot in core skills to V as you can.
---
timer boards are public.  assuming you can read.
---
If one titan was enough to make Vily say the Fa-word I wonder what 2 titans and ~8 super results in!
---
הם תמיד מביאים כבוד ודבקים במריבות, יש לי הרבה תת-מגבלות בשבילם.
---
Revenge for what, INIT and Snuff only lost a keep km.
---
Big explosions are healthy for the game. Props to snuff.
---
Panfam* lost to INIT/Snuff/IH, nice. 
---
I lost precious hours on move ops. 
---
well even so test ate sh\*, snuff still are a bunch of fa\* :)

I've seen the scale of botting in every major NS alliance, yeah

Snuff supporting LGBT rights
---
Know your place, testies.
---
Why would CCP even bat an eye at this? The game itself offers the freedom to do this and its not griefing. CCP goes after ratting botters because its taking money directly out of their pockets. This is insignificant compared to vni botters
---
There wasn't a WiS team. Those programmers, modelers, riggers, animators, and texture artists would need to have been retasked from other projects. Probably "working on EVE" projects.
---
1. It was supers umbrella in a standing fleet that yoloed to kill lokis. 
---
2. I dont think there was even an FC.
---
3. Mueller found there was no evidence to charge trump criminally, its already been proven he and his campaign met with russia in Trump Tower.
---
What else are you wrong about :thinking:
---
&gt; Actually reading the trash heap that is /r/eve
---
Oy vey goyim
---
wait, gatesliding is no longer a thing??
---
I wouldnt mind it. Fresh starts are good sometimes. But probably most people in eve would go apeshit about their precious stuff n so on. Tho i thihk the real value is in the connections we make.

I don't know if you quite understand how much power difference there is between 100 dreads and the 80 titans they pull now. The main thing is that the titans come with a fax ball, this means that if you dread bomb them with literally a full 250 man fleet of dreads you may kill 1 titan if youre lucky, otherwise you'll just get a bunch of fax kills and lose 250 dreads. A hypothetical snuff 100 man dread bomb is actually fightable by the other lowsec entities. Snuff doesn't outnumber the other groups by much. SC plus DHSJ together are already the same number of pilots and dreads as a snuff form. No supers changes the game power dynamic completely for lowsec.
---
They were tackled not rorqs. Only 1 rorq was harmed in the making of this BR (I think)
---
Your telling me dropping supers on roamers isnt fun?
---
wtf is wrong with you
---
NO COLLUSION
---
Revenge of the revenge of the titan dead
---
I guess balance is decided late in the 5k pilots titanfests.....probably resulting in 10k pilots titanfests.

---
With aether wars running, I have hope that the server issues that people gripe about won't be as big an issue. I think the teams that are currently working on skins and cosmetic items could probably head this up in all honesty.
---
Other games actually have an rpg feel to it, but eve feels more like an rts than an rpg. Dont get me wrong I love fcing and killing shit. But I also like making videos and stuff too. Would like to make something like clear skies one day. 
---
TEST Fax pilot. Save fax first !
---
We basically talked to the people selling them, the only thing that happened?
---
It seems clear that they knew Snuff had a dread bomb there. 
---
Given that there were only like 5 apostles on grid, it might not have mattered.

as long as you don't have egg on our face but it sounds like a grid/content anchor?

I always heard *of* it but the money has gone to traders.

Don't forget the 70b from yesterday
---
What did test say about frat caps eating shit? I didn't quite hear that.
---
Max cringe.
---
I will never get that time back. 
---
I'm surprised NC. held on to it as long as they did after the DRF was gone.  Hard to defend space that far away, rental space is fine but it needs to be close to defend.   
---
Blue balls. 
---
&gt; and I can't believe there was a AAA guy in there.        
---
Why?
---
&gt; So who´s the big boy in Wh-space now that the dust have settled ? 
---
Initiative
---
If INIT and Snuff dropped only to be counter dropped that is backstabbing. Hy Wanto and Sort have one thing in common and it's their ability for people to ignore their real backstabs.
---
Nobody calls Hy Wanto, The Hero of Black Rise, the f word and gets away with it!
---
*Nobody!*
---
However high you set one-time price, as long as it's paid (you get your supercap), it's yours and there's nothing to that. Having pre-keepstar system when owning a super was less of being able to afford it, and more being able to solve all the logistics that come with having one (sitter/dedicated pilot, always being logged in space, having to get to relative safety manually when taking extended break from the game in case your group gets evicted etc.). Regardless of the hull price, introduction of keepstars removed big and important upkeep cost (both in form of ISK and time) that always came with owning a super.
---
Sorry I don't quite understand
---
Yeah I think that just goes back to Ghost presentation of helping. If you are helping it is probably because there is a back log of shit to be done:
---
More JF runs
---
More Cyno chains
---
More DDs / Reps / Links / Eyes
---
This all to moar better facilitate others.
---
Yeah sorry I don’t have the T2 gun, not the same area and same tz on similar targets.
---
&gt; Pandemic Horde is a new player alliance with a culture of fighting anyone who comes by, mostly in small ships.
---
That's a joke, right? Literally every time I've been to horde space, they've dropped at least one HAW dread on me. That said, it's usually in a small gang, and not solo.
---
It's 2019, WAFFLES can fuck whomever they want.
---
He's actually laughing in comms right now. I, for one, welcome our mad king.
---
So the billboard message came from Zorya Triglav, right? Zorya in Slavic mythos are the two guardian goddesses of Simargl - a winged hound that would bring about armageddon if it managed to break free from being chained to Polaris - the star in the Ursa Minor. However, this is only 2 Gods - 3 if you include the dog I guess?
---
(They also see in sun-rises and sun-sets as one opens the doors to the Sun God's palace so he can ride his chariot across the sky and the other one closes them behind him when he returns.)
---
This gets confusing as Triglav means 'three-headed' - as the three-peaked mountain in Slovenia that shares the name proves - and was also a Slavic deity but with each head representing the sky, the earth and the underworld. Triglav is meant to be a merging of three other Gods although it depends on the tradition which ones. The interesting combination to me for this purpose would be Svarog (the Slavic version of Hephaestus, god of the forge), Perun (leader of the Pantheon and God of the sky, lightning etc as well as war and law) and Veles (god of the underworld and trickery).
---
Could it be that the Triglavians are trying to prevent the release of something that they believe will bring about the end of New Eden (like the Zorya) but that this Triglavian that contacted the capsuleers is the leader of the Triglavians, creating ships that capsuleers can use, building up trust only for there to be a trick at the end of it that leads to the darkness of the Underworld/Abyss?

Why won't you join these other morons in jump range of stain and feed? FITE ME COWARDS.

Its good ppl who rat contribute money to pay off my stupidity!
---
You don't even know it was freighters, not rorquals?
---
Idk about Sort, but Snuff has a reputation for backstabbing. Why anyone would trust them in 2019 is beyond me.
---
"The whole farm your miners" thing is pretty played out my dude... 
---
\&gt;You literally are in a ship that has more EHP than a carrier
---
\&gt;Has ridiculous defensive capabilities
---
\&gt;Has 6,000 m3 for drones (bert muh excuhvatoors…) okay fine, 3,750 m3 for attack drones 
---
\&gt;oh shit... 400% to remote shield boosters
---
\&gt;70k m3 to store \~ 546.875 Navy Cap Booster 3200s to fuel your Capitol Ancill or your Cap Boosters til downtime
---
\&gt;A 'wetu' depot anchored next to you to save around 6b if shit hits the fan... removing the only profitable thing on your hull
---
\&gt;Press dat indy core (let's pretend you're not a poor and you injected into a T2) you're now practically immune to standard EWAR, you're drones become 30% faster... I literally witnessed yesterday warriors moving at 12k (that's so fast they can't even hit the target you're trying to target, you're retarded random TEST rorqual), you can now Tokyo Drift straight out of range of the cyno inhib with just a boost of your MWD prior to cycling
---
\&gt;Do we even want to talk about the PANIC module... or the fact it not only gives you immunity but THERES MORE! The whole fleet in your belt with you immunity...
---
\&gt;Oh you're on an Athanor or a Tatara… Let's just spare the details of what a citadel adds to the fight.
---
\&gt;Initiate shit talk as soon as your ceptor friend burns out of inhib range and brings in supers and titans.
---
Coming from the trailer park of WH space a C3 with no effects and only a NS-static with six of my friends (likely dual-tri boxing) to kill your Rorqual at minimal takes 30-45 minutes if you're halfway confident and let me online my inhib prior to popping your cyno (there are some exceptions to this). To kill a single carrier, it takes 2 hyperions and 5 minutes.
---
Morale of this story, stop playing the silly "bert, I'm an el miner" victim card. You're the safest you ever have been in Eve Online history.
---
Nah, he's joking.
---
Come to Delve, only miners and ratters here.
---
I mean, you can see some stuff in your local game logs. If all guns are activating on you at the same time, it's obviously suspect.
---
There are so many things wrong with your post. Why not keep both space and real politics out of it and be accurate on what was tackled?
---
Oh okay, I’ll come sometime in the next 24 hours, so I hope *no pirates camp the gate for the next 24 hours without sleeping*
---
Please put up the lowsec connection on the CCP table.

Like we need to reopen whole south again for **moving in** a capital fleet.       
---
It was something that was lost due to jump range nerfs. 
---
as an ESI dev and recruiter for a corp, i can assure you its nothin too abnormal.
---
as a newb you probably feel pretty powerless, but nothins more valuable than a spy in an enemy corp. Information is power.
---
ESI can be most safely dealt with by going to eveonline.com and signing in, then use whatever the corp program/website wants. this will have you already logged into eve, and prevent you from ever typing your passwords into their program.

when you click on the character, itll list the "scopes", or categories of information, that they can get. theres not really a lot of bad things they could possibly do at all, but still yet most dont really require a lot.

---
Whenever I was a teenager I had a friend who was was friends with someone who robbed me. When he still hung out with him I decided I didnt want to be friends with someone who was willing to hang out with someone who robbed me. Vily didn't backstab anyone and you know it
---
I think a lot of the accounts from my experience with these people is from the legacy days of needing Super sitters. And if they continued training up the sitter...and another super was collected...well now you might need double the accounts for EaCh oF ThEm NeEd SiTtErS. 
---
fa-word 
---
That's true. Never though to check the logs at the time. If all 20 activate on the same second, it's a no brainer.

Well that was quick. Can't wait for next META Show now!

what kind of FAGGOT would do something like this?!

And here I put in another thread that you're a cross between Ghandi, Mr Rodgers and Abe Lincoln in articulation, and then here you are posting in all caps and no punctuation. 
---
I amend my proclamation;  Ghandi, Mr Rodgers, Abe Lincoln, and Dave Attell. 
---
what in the fuck
---
literally unplayable
---
I'm in the same boat, brother. I just left the null blob life for less toxicity and more freedom too.
---
My plan is to move solo into wh space, living nomad out of an orca for a while. I have 4 accounts so it should be nice while allowing me to have zero exposure if i don't feel like logging in for a month or whatever.
---
That EVE is a social game can not be denied though, maybe we ought to form a discord for solo wh nomads only. This way we can do our freedom thing but still have others to talk to, etc.
---
Hit me up if interested.

Does anyone feel like TEST is going to blue frat and panfam to get back at snuff/init then WW3 happens?
---
Yep, they're photoshopped to boost color and contrast but no cut &amp; paste editing.
---
you never take a fight under a jammer? and then stop and realize we arent their enemy despite what nc tells them hopefully
---
i agree totally nc tells them hopefully
---
This is getting good.  Something tells me Snuff knew Camal Keepstar was going to shack things up.   Imperium forces poking at Test, PanFam extending a helping hand...  Frat and the once DRF/Red Alliance slap fighting, NC. having to quail a rebellion in Spire.  You have a stage where GoTG to Legacy could band together to fight the Imperium.  I say burn it all down....   
---
I'm not quite sure what you guys do in most 100man fleets because they had 8 left when the hello kitty skins come out on test server we arent their enemy despite what nc tells them hopefully
---
what the fuck are you on about dude
---
Shouldn't you be shooting snuff then? or yourself maybe? 
---
hello kitty is dangerous i agree, fuck nc and their hello kitty skins
---
Then release the whole report. What are you scared of?
---
Why is it in one thread I'm here advocating your ability to formulate responses to things as if you were a mix of Gandhi, Mr Rodgers and Abe Lincoln, and then in this response you are using all caps with no punctuation.

I amend my statement earlier;  Gandhi, Mr Rodgers, Abe Lincoln, and Dave Attell.

because deals....

I believe they call that Democratic Socialism.

Quite sure razor is multinational

Soridar Ravencroft, and talking out of his ass as per usual. He was around during that period afaik but I don't remember him leading a 36h fleet.

Underrated comment.

NPC areas like this should be places where all groups can stage attacks on SOV space around it.

and? how does a fair chunk of Catch and space in vale i was actually careful about making it as you likely want from this comment

Good guy snuff standing up for the LGBTQ  community

not really
---
&gt; The Jove were some religious sect wanting to start there own society
---
That's the Amarr, from the Conformist sect of the Unified Catholic Church, which took over the planet of Soekheviti in the Milky Way and eventually lost power and expelled from the planet after a few decades. The Conformists, led by Dano Gheinok, therefore migrated to New Eden when the wormhole appeared, and settled on the planet of Athra.

Are we talking about balancing FW or about balancing Snuff?

babe had no ideea they buyed dreds...got like 10 lying around...saw them weeks ago moving around t8 pocket...guessed they go eso direction but...fuck test anyway :))

Bombers are pretty cheap man, I buy doctrine Stukas for 78m

I hope so

IMAGINE IF VILY WOULDNT BE EATING PIZZA DURING THAT HAPPENED IT COULD BE WAY WORSE FOR TEST LOL

Sadly none of those you bought where mine.        
---
I don't sell heavy stuff.         
---
&lt;3 your work, please put some pressure on CSM and CCP so you could move the dread bomb next time more easily.            
---
For havens sake ... it is NPC space and lack of entry point is blocking attacks on southern sov regions. 
---
Yeah, it sucks.
---
UX has been big fail last couple of years
---
new map suck, new scan window is suck
---
hitboxes fucked, popups obnoxious  
---
&gt;Vily didn't backstab anyone. You are hanging out with their enemies. 
---
Well by that logic, the TEST fleet hanging out with panfam makes them our enemies so are you sure you want to go with that line?
---
to be blue for you to be fair the TEST/co2 in sh1 was literally 14m 55seconds when they didn't like it and just let em go. once your a few carriers and then stop and realize we dont always win but we have been 4th or 5th

I observe Stain market for interesting stuff poping up - mostly cheap legacy caps.      
---
If a reasonable contract was gone &lt;2 days ... well someone is buying them. 
---
What are the chances those are Test dreads? I mean they do sell dreads to known hostiles. 
---
Initially I'd recommend a big entity like Goons or PanFam to learn what you like in Eve from a null-sec view point. However, the other option is EveUni who can help you find out what you enjoy, help you learn to get better and then point you into the right direction when it's time for you to graduate.
---
I only suggest KarmaFleet or Pandemic Horde first because comradeship is the lifeblood of this game and you are very likely to find it when fighting against a common foe.
---
But, why fix FW when the CSM don't care about it? Also more rorqual nerfs please they still undock. 
---
&gt;Remove LP snowball effect, set all the factions to tier 3 permanently = chinese and russian bot rmters starve and die ( in game) 
---
How about a different way of cashing out? By running plexes you gain victory points which you can then cash in for a time-limited bonus to LP payout at a time of your choosing. Basically this encourages players to run plexes and thus contributing to FW/PvP instead of just running missions in uncatchable stuff all day.

seems to be camal lose 100b to have some fun

1dq1 has no gates. Only retard traps.
---
Just incase you don't know, SRP stands for Ship Replacement Programme and means - as long as you've fitted it to the standard expected - you'll get refunded for certain ships that you lose minus the insurance payout. I say certain ships as they usually have to be ones that the corp/alliance you're in fly en masse in fleets and not often the ship you just threw together in order to hopefully kill someone hanging around just outside your station.

2 minutes. I bought a Prophecy in Amarr when I was young, fitted it, undocked with too low sec status (or faction standing? I don't remember). Tried to warp off, bumped a freighter, bounced off, got killed by NPCs.

Why is everyone so surprised that it's possible for people to be wrong?

At the time when I made the comment, It seemed as if goons were falling apart. I don't think anybody expected them to bounce back as fast as they did.

These aren't ships commonly, if ever, used by horde.

---
There are guidelines regarding dropping, and in some cases where these guidelines are broken, the beans get talked to. A lot of the time it's allowed though.
---
The good thing about fighting haws is that you can pretty quickly and easily disengage and fight on another grid. And while the drops are getting more and more common as more beans get into caps, whether you want to accept it or not, Geminate is still one of the best areas in the entire game to roam and fight subcaps.

Before I got too lazy for subs my camp comp was usually 3 gila scimi daredevil sabre rapier just as on field comp, shield/info/skirm links across two off-grid boosters, sabre cloaked next door orbiting @ 2150 as scout / plan b tackle, and several covops/proteus/arazu alts cloaked on grid with relevant stagers, chokepoints, or +1 alternate routes of ingress to know when to switch gate and because nobody likes surprises
---
I'd warp small shit off to safes if it was going to be a real fight of course, anchor gilas on rapier and trigger with rapier while manual piloting scimi and rapier to stagger the ranges so I could screen for the scimi
---
Blopsing was usually a cloaky rorqual for supplies, crane for drop shipping anchorable bubbles and ozone, 4 blops bs, a couple cyno sabres camping inlines for jfs/carriers and 3-4 proteus hunters

---
&gt; And while the drops are getting more and more common as more beans get into caps, whether you want to accept it or not, Geminate is still one of the best areas in the entire game to roam and fight subcaps.
---
That sentence pretty much encapsulates everything that is wrong with the capital meta. When you go to "one of the best areas to fight subcaps" and can't do so without getting caps dropped on you, something is wrong.
---
I don't believe the guidelines even exist, and if they do, I seriously doubt they are enforced. I haven't seen any evidence of that. When I say it happens "literally every time" I do mean it. I don't remember one trip to geminate that didn't involve getting at least one cap dropped on me.
---
I miss the days when you could go to scalding pass and PFR would just send kitchen sink trash at you. Sometimes you farm, sometimes you get blobbed, but it was EXTREMELY rare for anyone to use a cap against you. Those were the good old days (for me at least).
---
Hasn't everyone undocked while drunk in Jita and died for reasons?

This coming from the guy who's been posting nonstop damage control to try and protect the reputation of his elite 4-4 camping group. Just stay aligned, dude. Then when the caracal with meta launchers yellow boxes you, you can safely warp off and prevent any more embarrassing killmails.
---
They don’t actually have Titans and supers on every gate 24/7. But if you tackle something with a cyno, there will be titans on top of you in seconds, and if you annoy them then they will gatecamp you

I would be surprised if talks were not already underway.   If it were just Snuff it would be one thing but with Init showing up I believe we are going to see lots of "content" sooner then later.  I believe Vily over reacted to Snuff dropping his move op, I mean its what Snuff does.  Why think Snuff would do anything but what Snuff does?  Vily in knee jerk reaction accepted help from a Panfam aligned group.  Snuff, I would assume knew Test would guard the Camal Keepstar and bat phoned Init to get Imperium proper involved.  Hy and Vily had a rap battle, 8 mile style on The Meta Show,  Snuff seems to have already had a dread bomb waiting in Stain, probably for at least a few weeks now and used it to surprise drop Test again, cause thats what Snuff does, like ninja.  However Init showed up to the party once again.  Init has been poking NC. and now starts poking Test, this is how enemies become friends.   Mittens in his Ivory tower sees all this happening and sees where this could lead as old battle lines were drawn at Camal.   
---
Bought ship, nah i dont need it -&gt; reprocess.
---
In a heated exchange on the ground at that time TEST had taken basically zero esoteria space.
---
Jebaited
---
Was fun for sure. It was the first time using eve o-preview with 5 accounts and it was quite challenging. Going three to two monitors is no bueno 
---
its p easy when you havent played in years. you should try it saltboi.

Even we have to rest sometimes.
---
Revenge of the NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERDS
---
Pretty sure most of the old players like us are dual or triple clienting  in fights like this.
---
It's kinda a bitch 
---
do you have to be a garrison not a new player focused entity in the last 3 fights i had.
---
Vily showed restraint by giving heads up and not backstabbing Snuff and friends in Camal after the Titan backstab by Snuff. He could have easily done so. He wanted to send a message and call it a day. But now, Init and Snuff actively participating and killing TAPI have escalated this to the status of: It's happening.
---
You've got to be the most subservient pet in history of Eve if you let this slide, TEST.  
---
Just. Dont. Feed.
---
No doubt. Trying to be a hic, two dreads an a fax was a bit much. Add on trying to use the preview for the first time. I wasn't too happy with myself. I just don't have room for 3 monitors on my desk again :( 
---
This is the breadwinner, imho, of how to make fw great again. This is absolutely what i wish could happen.
---
And lol galmil renting from tapi :thonking:
---
Post saved so i can spam this around everyso often when this topic comes up for the next 2 years until they do this.
---
You know that CCP is moving intact plates to Blood Raider relic sites?        
---
Right?           
---
oh no he did. Re: now deleted meta show
---
Ad no tidi to that and its gets a bit trickier. 
---
Huge fights it's so slow and easy to pull of. 
---
Not the same in the fights we have. 
---
You have one bit wrong there, time spent krabbing is directly proportional to the ratio of total accounts / pve-capable accounts, so when it's krabbing time probably everything but a fax, a titan, and a scout are gonna reship to krab accounts 1-9 :P
---
There are times when brevity and loudness have a special kind of eloquence.

This from a guy who is still docked up. [https://zkillboard.com/related/30001527/201903231700/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30001527/201903231700/)
---
None of you nullseccers are elite because all you do is press f1 when told. Pirat is also shit but a different kind of shit.
---
Ahh today's Brisc takes credit for shit he had nothing to do with thread.
---
Got it.
---
If I get enough of them maybe I can convince CCP to introduce a corpse throne as a buildable item. I really wanted the pandolorica corpse as well but his harpy aligned just barely too fast for me to point it.
---
Hey, I was there. I only write AAR's about fights I was actually in. 
---
Bought one cheap with shit rigs - instead of repackage i did a reprocess.      
---
If this counts. 
---
I always thought plexing by orbiting a beacon and pretty much going afk sucked,  having some ♦NPCs running around that you could kill for LP sounds better to me.  Even better if they can react to what you bring and let you fly with some friends without killing your income.  
---
bought, unlocked. pop.
---
Rofl.. I mean myself and most of the other “senior” guys in my Corp keep our shit separate.
---
PvP toons stay in PvP staging and krab toons stay krabbing. Mainly because it’s annoying moving them all between the two. And being able to immediately respond to pings is nice. 
---
But yeah, you could also put them all on the same account and just re-log
---
Don't take eve so seriously friendo
---
I got brain damage just from reading your horrible AAR i didnt even need to watch the video
---
I don't know how we are meatballs, but we are after all a punjabi friendly gay alliance, so, I guess we can be a bunch of meatballs somehow as well...
---
Bought shuttle for travel today. Undocked from the Beanstar warp to Ojianen Gate get caught by snuff bubble. Die. 
---
Like Malcanis said, bombers are cheap. You can get a goku hound for 88m or a harpy for 70m if you aren't flair baiting. If you really want the budget version gokus allows crucifiers.

This fight is from last night, forgot to post here :)

I love faggots. Especially with mashed tatties...
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faggot_(food)
---
i agree.  last incursion i purposely fought a goon fleet in an incursion system so I wouldn't have someone lighting a cyno and a dozen caps jumping in to fight a few dozen subcaps
---
Who said it was common? The statistics aren’t from “common” people. They’re from the people who literally no-life EVE everyday.
---
Also, how is that combo not realistic? I’ll give ya the random “krab” accounts. But the other 10 are definitely not un-realistic. And in-fact are my exact account set up (minus titan and second fax as I don’t have a titan). 
---
please put the coolaid down before its too late

&gt; Here's some video, but it's from Bad Juice so you may get brain damage:

qft
---
A curse and a blessing we don't generally see TiDi. 
---
We got, at best, mixed signals from Vily, and flat out lies from another TEST FC. So hey, now we're even. 
---
wow thanks test for bringing a GF!
---
The culture of the time have been nuetral since TEST lived in vale.
---
wat 
---
You’ll be renting from goons soon enough, though. 
---
Fastest uploader in the South

Great vid, music selection, and atmosphere
---
Hold one,, ill start another thread so i can answer your question in this thread about why its not in another thread ...
---
big if true
---
Lighten up, Francis. 
---
Same difference. 
---
Not if you're a shield super that is for some ungodly reason not deployed. Then you can get fucked.
---
sue no
---
Every single one of those undeployed Hel’s deserved to die.
---
I bet PETA will have no idea what the hell still uses 32bit anyway
---
Not surprised. B0T is technically just Lady Scarlet's personal rental project IIRC, or at least that's the way it is when it suits NC. Anyway, in truth, the only way B0T has really kept their space has been via paying people off and other diplomatic means. I have seen them bring in the occasional pvp group that they use to help buff home def, but they're never really going to be able to defend against an determined attack.
---
So yeah, bigass rental empire, not very well defended. Half surprised nobody has rolled the space aready.
---
Gotta admit - ballsy and dank move
---
AAR?
---
test isn't blue with imperium.  its neutral.  bringing in a dread bomb like this doesnt break the NAP.  If it had been a cloaky camper tackling rorqs?  Ya, then some drama.  It was some roaming lokis tackling 4 freighters on a gate.
---
tbh there probably was not a lot of overlap between people running 13+ accounts and the use of sitters
---
Established best practice was to buy/train a mostly finished cap pilot and make it your dedicated super account.  
---
People who used sitters were the vain / retarded sort who wanted to be seen in it on their main.
---
"Main" has a lot less conceptual significance when you have many high sp accounts and involve most of them for any given activity
---
Imagine wasting Mino reps on some freighter. Excellent work.
---
FUCK SNUFT YES SIR
---
is this the same group vily called a offensive gay slur ? 
---
Feel free to write your own, spanky. 
---
your AAR had about as many facts right as a Trump press release
---
Why weren't you staring at some random twitch stream?
---
It's exciting to see AAA. It's like seeing Razor. 
---
This is what happens when your entire alliance is built around the idea of farming noobs and never dying. They're simply not used to losing anything. So when the pirate falls off his vessel and into the water, you can be sure he will be [one with the salt.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KquFZYi6L0)

AAR: Originally pinged for nightmares, got 70 or so dudes in fleet﻿, good logi numbers with okay﻿﻿﻿﻿ nightmare numbers, first lowsec timer was clear and﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ so we decided to head to H6 to see what there was to pew as o﻿ur Astra on the TRC forti was nearly vulnerable again (final timer).
---
   
---
TRC had buddied up with all their usual friends, including SC. Altogether they had a small handful of dreads (4-5, mostly HAW), aswell as 25-30 carriers and 4 or so FAX. They cyno'd into Shintaht, jumped H6 and we managed to get 2 carriers and a FAX bubbled while they warped out. We proceeded over there, killed a carrier, started shooting another one (got fairly low) however the Apo﻿stle triaged and the rest of their fleet landed, we got out with pretty much no losses and 1 carrier kill. We got back to the Astrahus and a few minutes later they landed again, they got a bubble on us however we were able to overheat out of the bubble and went to 9UY, with only one or two losses.
---
switched comp up to AC Machs, sent another ping out and started reforming. By the time we were ready to go we had roughly 35 machs, 1 Apostle/1 Ninazu and 4-5 dreads. We warped to a ping on the H6 gate to avoid bubbles, however the enemy fleet was waiting on the other side, and although we were smartbomb fit, jumping in would have meant too many losses due to travel time to anchor and crossing gate (can't smartbomb on a gate). We knew we had spies in comms so I decided to use that to our advant﻿age and play their spies to move their fleet off gate. Vitus suggested going to another system first and I called for someone to get a cyno into Shintaht and for a bridging titan to log in. We aligned back to the keepstar and initiated warp. Low and behold they played straight into our hands, recalled fighters and started warping Shintaht just like we needed. As soon as we landed on the titan, we immediately warped back to H6 at 0km (their bubblers all went to Shintaht) and we jumped through and got setup on the other side.
---
2-3 Minutes later their entire fleet lands around 60km off us. Everyone is anchored on me, including guards and our caps are aligned to the enemy blob so they can drift with our fleet in triage/siege. They all put their fighters on us and I called for smartbombs on for a few cycles, within 15 seconds their entire fighter blob was recalled and we began shooting at an Apostle with everything. ﻿W﻿ithin a minute or two local started to increase a bit an﻿d they warped in a group of dreads, around 8 or so with an apostle. During this I called multiple times for more pings to go out for max caps and instructed on com﻿ms multiple times that anyone with a cap needs to warp to h6, jump in, siege and follow primaries. This worked fucking amazingly. Our fleet numbers started to increase steadily and I had more triage and dreads coming in every 20 seconds or so, by this time we had killed the majority of the enemy dread group and the carrier/fax fleet started to burn away. With the dread advantage and sufficient triage on grid, we kept the enemy fleet bubbled and went to work on them. We killed most of their FAXs, however a good portion of their fleet managed to jump out due to a little mishap with our bubbles, however we still had a good portion tackled. I kept calling targets, enemies kept dying, more caps came on grid for us etc. and after a few mins of intense fighting their fleet was down to a small group of carriers - at this point we were just finishing off the scraps left.
---
    
---
As we switched onto the second to last carrier however, Snuff appeared on grid with a 40 man Tengu﻿ fleet, however I was told they wouldn't shoot us so we kept a bit weary of them, finished off the last carrier and pr﻿oceeded to successfully evacuate all remaining caps. Snuff went home and we looted around 20ish bil from grid.
---
Sorry aar is a bit long, copy pasted it from my main one, cba to write a shorter one.
---
delve is probably still triple, its what PL attempts to grow on me at times as well.
---
we call our FC's "fun coordinators"
---
Holy shit, if that would happen, I'd leave Nullsec partially and make my way to FW. Finally some PVE that actually takes some thought and skill.
---
What? In my guide, I show the exact outline for how I make Wetware Mainframes (P4 that uses 3 P3s, each of which requires three P2s. That's as it ) using only 2 characters. Each (of nine) planet makes one P2. Each P3 requires 3 P2, so those nine P2s become three P3s... which then become one P4.... using only one factory planet. 2 toons, 10 planets, P4 being produced about 2/3 of the time. If you could up your P0 production for two resources to 24k units/hour --&gt; 4 P1 factories for each --&gt; 4 P2 factories for each, that would keep one P4 factory with a maximum-input P4 running constantly.
---
Are you just trying to do this with each planet has P0 -&gt; P1? That works, but you have to check them pretty much every day, rather than every 4 days with what I've laid out.
---
Cause I was blowing shit up.
---
Actually CCP tried to do that, and it was pure cancer. (who lives in FW space will remember it)
---
It was ended like NPCs was gatecamping and killing guys who had bad standing against them. Their fleet even had some logis so some solo ppl stopped to roam around lol
---
Hey, I can only speak for the part I was present for. We cynoed in, killed shit, left. The rest is from our FCs. 
---
The salt, the pain, the wound, the salt in the wound, the pain!
---
Huh?
---
Freighters are just Rorquals that can't mine tbh
---
Yeah it's a Kiwi, Dragon Fruit, Strawberry flavor mixed with Pina Colada. 
---
Trust me AAA is nothing.....      
---
Well i see AAA on my ov few times a week. 
---
This is pretty good too.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sN6_tetmdI
---
i know this version of events is easier, but is it so hard to belive there was just communication errors?
---
spod bless you
---
bad bot
---
Are you sure about that? Because I am 99.68777% sure that vily_b is not a bot.
---
Because a player using about a dozen VNI bots can make more in a couple of weeks then some veteran players have made in their hole EVE career, with almost no risk to the bots.
---
Why not?
---
Butthurt highsec campers. Sounds like high quality salt.
---
.... isnt it easier just to buy every skill then train as you need or is that just me
---
I'm just saying that if you remove supers you remove the main power problem. Normal caps are much easier for subs and smaller/poorer groups to deal with
---
9 years, only one account, mostly one character too. Dunno I just like doing everything with my main, my alt is really only for PI and station trading. 
---
Underrated comment. SNUFF trying to spin this as a victory smh made you dreadbomb
---
I thought I was on pornsubreddit for a second there
---
Hit me up if interested in a solo wh/nomad life discord group, there seems to be enough of us to have one.
---
Iirc #7 is due to to the stab changes.
---
Lol @ #10
---
#11 remove the faction police from high sec 
---
Part credit goes to Nivlac for his help.
---
How???
---
&gt; But yeah, you could also put them all on the same account and just re-log
---
That is actually what I ended up doing when rorquals happened, everything with a need to exist outside of pve except 1 titan, 1 fax and a couple scouts got a rorq on a secondary char slot, in part because that was much cheaper to inject, and former dedicated pve accounts got extracted and reinjected to rorq :P
---
those are worth even less
---
Looking at the BR seems it started with Radamere getting tackled in his Rouq in 0-O?  Smart, tackle the FC.  
---
&gt;waaah i cant be 100% safe if it doesnt have a reinforcement timer
---
yea case in point
---
I really should consider training up for bombers then, seems like I’m missing loads of explosions and exploding 😂
---
Provi in 2019: Will take fights 150-70 in EUTZ. Will dock up on Keepstar grid in USTZ on equal numbers. 
---
Bad fight to take from our side, new FCs. Mistakes made, others blamed. Had fun though. Finally got to get that insurance. 
---
Cool dude, cool memes.
---
Earlier today, trained for Hecate and was excited to try it out, Corp mate says he’s tackled, jump in to help (2jumps from where I undocked) and end up being in a bubble surrounded by like 30 caracals lol
---
Oh come on now... Come on... You can do this Vily. I believe in you. 
---
TAPI now part of PanFam you heard it here first
---
Do that 100 more times and you might actually have something to be smug about  [https://zkillboard.com/war/620521/](https://zkillboard.com/war/620521/) 
---
Lol best part of this post is it leaves out your corp being kicked for incompetence as well as you having to pay someone to evict because you don't posses the competence to do it yourself. 
---
noob (im finding all your posts)
---
why would you buy caps in stain when you can just build them in test and jump them over
---
Why vily didn't mind control whoever stood down the camal Keepstar attack did he? 
---
fuck now i want you. naked. next to me.
---
We play EVE we will never get yhe time back
---
&gt; Provi held the field.
---
Now there's a phrase you would never expect in a big fight just a few years ago.
---
Provi's come a long way.
---
The game is shit, just fucking quit dude.
---
But I want a complete collection, then I can put them in a container and make a "FCs of the imperium boxed set, slightly used" contract :)
---
Don't worry about it - it's a meme now. I certainly don't think you fucked us on purpose. 
---
the way they talk about new content creation tools and new AI always sounds exciting, then they go and drop stuff like resource wars where I don't even know if it's good or bad content I just know the reward structure is negative so I've never tried it. 
---
I get they have to protect against players cheesing content but they've put some seriously rewarding stuff out there seems like it's worth trying a bit more since it's already developed. 
---
So... because it didn't attack you, even though you would have, that makes it the work of a bot?!
---
Maybe they had to get this done before logging, maybe they were paid to do it, maybe they couldn't be bothered, maybe they didn't even notice you flashing as they were concentrating?
---
FUCK SNUFF!!!
---
FUCK THIER PETS PEN IS OUT AND SALT FARMERS!
---
Except every goon.
---
We took the fight with 80 guys, we just pinged for more as the fight progressed. Though we did go in with much less caps initially. 
---
Im eutz though, i dont know much about the workings of ustz.
---
well, last time i had TOTAL CAPITALS.
---
Something like that
---
No collusion 
---
such hypocracy
---
Yes you're right I don't know any hardcore pvpers. 
---
1 would make super travel aids for no reason.
---
is that how much a bomber is nowadays, yikes. I remember in my day fitted bombers were 15-20m.
---
is it?  or is it a capital pilot not wanting to share killmarks?
---
Just because you do it does not make it realistic. Most people aren't going to pay 45 USD or 1500 plex a month for 3 cyno accounts. 
---
Hell if you're down near delkin or cloud ring I'll fight ya, only 12mil SP myself
---
Well I guess if two groups are arguing over something, one of them has to be right.
---
It's really not surprising that your FCs can't keep track of the ridiculous amount of diplomatic agreements you guys have. Apparently every time you deploy, you add some more and it keeps costing you friend after friend...
---
Reminds me of when I was a noob and fitted my hurricane with both shield and armour tank
---
200 iq play in that fight - make it seem like the freighters are actually more important than the titans, force enemy to kill freighters, save a bunch of wyverns. well played test.
---
Come join us in delve &gt;:)
---
&gt;Horde don't use ramjags

Snuck Fuff
---
Vily bot, whoever owns it activated it again in light of recent events.  
---
Citation needed. Google gives me nothing.
---
i literally fly a heretic wtf
---
Undocked from jita, blackscreened, and got blapped by faction police before I could log back in. Had that malediction for like 2 minutes.
---
im pretty sure you just described loyalty points
---
Its been a very long time since I had a PRC-77 strapped to my back. 
---
They then ragequit the game, and we get less targets.  Or, we can teach them to play and be somewhat competent, and we get content from others trying to drop them.
---
blazing fast high octane buffer dread single boxing, truly exciting piece of media
---
This is the biggest owned of the year, and the first act of agression of cfc against test. How can tapi work with imperium after the later has killed test supers ? Snuff is a thing cause not cfc but init I'd 100%.
---
Props to snuff for doing this, none to init cause they just dropped on what it was supposed to be imperium biggest ally.
---
I mean, I guess?  Not sure how steaming undeployed krabs has anything to do with Vily.
---
A whore is a whore.
---
His KB is mediocre from a solo standpoint. Only 68 kills and the majority of the action looks like nuking ratters and kitchen sinks in a nanogang.
---
Also the dude you're responding to is not a F1 monkey lol
---
Unless you like making isk while you PVP doing oplexing, because your options to oplex just got crammed into a couple of systems and they're going to be packed if it's the only option.
---
Youll catch up to the titan kills eventually
---
To me at least it looked like he was at least dualboxing judging by the hesitation in turning siege on. My guess is 2 dreads and a dictor.
---
Pfft Please, you'll only fight in fully implant pods, with Neutral Logi, Neutral bumpers and overwhelming numbers. P I R A T doesn't do fair fights lol
---
No.
---
Its a bot

---
The harpies are a really short train for you most likely (it's almost identical to the normal doctrine fit), and the chances you can't fly the crucifer is near zero. At worst I bet you could take a griffin, fit it like the kitsune in the fleet doctrine and bring that: you won't get SRP but griffins are stupidly cheap.
---
Remember when Talking in Stations named TEST the most influential alliance for 2018?   
---
Looks like they're really aiming for a second go-around.
