They on about the SP for the year long chat and local shit show maybe?
---
Wouldn't be surprised if they didn't even know free sp would be getting handed out this weekend. Left hand never seems to know what the right hand is doing.
---
Oh, no doubt about that.
---
&gt; Can I lose my ships
---
You may lose docking rights, but no, the assets will be retained in the structure until you trigger asset safety. Then you will have the option of moving them to another structure or NPC station in the same system at no cost.
---
&gt; can they do anything with my assets
---
No, only you can access your assets, even when they are in a hostile structure.

Also she has proven to be the most stable leader of the Amarr Empire post-Heideran VII. Largely because CCP doesn't care anymore.

Take it easy on Wally. He‚Äôs got kids to feed man. 
---
Shabbas goy. Mine is under a picture of an eggplant. 
---
Your scannability depends on sensor strength as well as your signature radius. There are very few avenues to lower your signature radius, on the other hand, it's much more easier jack up the sensor strength to be (almost?) unscannable.
---
Also nothing has a signature radius of 1.358 or 1.08 unless someone has found a way to pilot a mosquito in space, so what you are looking at is probably a product of sensor strength and sig rad as I've said above. I think you have a few more questions to ask before you should actually start flying your T3C.
---
Hell I'd take d-scan immunity
---
Rightclick your cyno in fleet, fleet&gt; jump to Member. 
---
Yea, he has a problem feeding. But that boi has the gall to put up a contract on us!
---
The ship attribute that makes it harder for you to be probed down is Sensor Strength, not Signature Radius. You run Sensor Boosters with ECCM scripts to increase it. There's no way to make yourself so "small" that nothing in the game can *ever* probe you down, but you can make yourself small enough that hunters need to bring specialized equipment (max skilled virtue prober) to pinpoint you.

I'm not saying that CSM should be experts, but instead of CSM, they could pull in subject matter experts for topics.
---
Why do they need a pipeline between the player base and devs?  This started in the era before social media and platforms like Twitter.  Devs are communicating directly to the player base now.
---
I will offer 50M for a Rasta corpse.
---

Isn't the direct line to the players social media platforms that the Devs are on/using?  CSM is only a direct line to 10 players.

I mean. Its an offer going on if you login, why should you get the offer when you dont login? 
---
They are not giving out free sp because they want to be nice. They are doing it to pump up stats and also people might check out some of the new stuff in the game or do something which gets them involved in the game again and thereby continues to play the game.
---
With that said, its a pretty wierd rejection reason! 
---
First of all F for this magnificent Man, Second his description fits 80% of FCs ingame.
---
Did you guys know that Poitot is the only named system in Syndicate? 
---
Yeah, it happened to a few caps as we left Oijanen.
---
Honestly the FC stayed several (and I mean several!!!) times not to jump to a beacon as we had cynos. Still lost some. 
---
Then after the 1st couple (and they yessed it out again) we lost at least one more. Some people are just there to serve as a warning to others I guess lol.

A long while back I did a real dumbass thing, I‚Äôm still too ashamed to admit it. It was, of course, entirely my fault and a loss that I could not at the time cover immediately. It was beyond annoying.
---
Here‚Äôs what you do: you learn from your mistake. Maybe you could have collapsed the wormhole or, not quite yet, but to the point where not too many ships can come through before it collapses.
---
The point is to get back on your feet, do it all again, and make sure you get the station up and running before calamity strikes.

Not in all cases. In lowsec they're a good slippery anti-subcap gank option. Even more so soon with the upcoming NSA changes. Good to jump a gang of blops in with 700+ dps each. Heaps of utility ie neuts, webs, scrams, remote reps and ecm. And if it's bait and shit goes south you can mjd out and fuckoffski or drop a triage and escalate.
---
They're a versatile slippery hotdrop option when it's probably bait.

fuck yeah, saves me a lot of time training for my latest project. Thanks CCP!

---
Kill. Then kill again. Repeat as needed.
---
Does FRCD still have that fort in FD-? Be a shame if something happened to it.
---
You feel shit because you were helpless. You couldn't fight back or do anything to win, and thus the outcome was outwith your control. It's that helplessness, that frustration, that's poisonous: isk can be regained, structures rebuilt, ships replaced...but power either is or isn't.
---
So take control back. Learn from the experience and see that as the pay-off of those months of "wasted" effort. 
---
I was in a similar situation with a structure killed by a corp with greater numbers and greater ships and greater experience. No hope for us to have any impact on the outcome: it was dead the second they decided they wanted it to be. It was demoralising because we had no power to affect the outcome. So, since we couldn't control a 5:1 overkill swarm having greater numbers, or characters that started playing years before and having many times over the skill points/isk to fly better ships, we could control our own experience level. We made alts specifically to roam and be shit at PvP in order to get slowly less shit at PvP. We reviewed skill training to make sure everyone could fly at least one viable damage ship that'd pose a threat, and dedicated some time to skilling that way. We found ways to keep our playstyles going that weren't relying on a structure so that if/when the next went down we weren't sitting lost and wondering where to go now. 
---
Effectively, we took control of the things we could control. Won't always be enough - probably not most of the time - but at least it gave us a plan of action, something we could control that would make us a little less helpless next time. Often, that's enough.

I was feeling a bit leery as a solo POS owner.  Can't decide if the time savings and other benefits would be worth the risk of being under constant war threat.
---
Meh, it's Eve though, right?  Maybe I'll just YOLO it on out there to see what happens.  If it turns into a war-dec PITA, I'll just take it down and join an actual corp instead.
---
PanFam sounds right up your alley.
---
Its true that Goons were from SA, but that was many expansions ago. The average goon now doesnt  know/care about the root of their scourge.

a slight boost to SP gained for the month will make skill injector farms slightly profitable again. they went into the red this month with the rising PLEX price. as long as they are even slightly profitable the 1000 account skills farms stay subscribed.

What's killing roaming is one of two things.
---
1. Concentration of people in small areas, allowing them to easily move / cyno to help friends. This means defenders response is almost immediate.
---
2. Cynos need to be changed.
---
One of those two things needs to happen. Either resource scarcity is implemented, forcing people to move around / move out from under cap umbrellas, or you need to change cyno mechanics. Until that happens, actual roaming in EVE is going to be pretty dead.
---
As a member of Panic Attack I 100% encourage all members of both alliances to shoot each other immediately to generate content and ISK
---
&gt;you still get the unallocated SP
---
yes.
---
if you have 4.5m and 500k unallocated you stop free training.  
---
if you have 4.5m + 500k unallocated and get 75k bonus you will now have 4.5m + 575k unallocated.

I was in a Brutix Navy Issue and burned out my entire high slot rack in the first 60 seconds of a very winnable match against Brave in AT15 that would have secured top 16 placement for my team and would have likely let us reach top 8 at least based on the following matches. Fuck.
---
Cynos lead to 1.  or at least camping and the need for an umbrella.    
---
So I'd suggest changing 2.) which would fix 1.)
---
also yea, implement resource scarcity, but again, if you don't fix cynos then the system will still be broken.

---
Dude this is the dumbest possible thing you could have admitted to on a public forum. If they were CFC renters, then you just managed to fuck yourself big time; if not, you also managed to fuck yourself because now people think you are associating with reds and you have a permanent stain on you.

You want to roam but you don't want to fight with the response. When the response tries to force a fight with you you cry instead.

Sounds like you just want soft ratter targets and not people actually prepared to fight you.

Free SP makes farmed SP less profitable, reducing the number of plex consumed by farm accounts. It's a net win.
---
Uhhh what? Poole was literally a SA user. 
---
Most good solo people and some roaming gangs usually scout regions before they start heavily roaming looking for content. 95% of the time the ansiblinx jump gates are labeled where they go so that you can read it. I for one enjoy having them for the very reasons stated above. I should be able to quickly defend my territory if I so choose to do so. If you're not smart enough to figure out how to scout shit before you roam and play smarter than the defender then bad on you for being a dumb.
---
Damn, they said the gay f word? Snuff is not going to be pleased about that let me tell you, not pleased at all.

I fear the day when someone decides to randomly pop my blockade runner even without being scanned and appraised.

---
Can't count how many times I've gone through this. And yet, the first time I lost something hurt the most. It was nothing, cheapest Vexor (not VNI) you can imagine that someone can fly after playing for the first 10 days. I took it to the lowsec, in my dreams I have been cleaning the belts and doing sooo much more ISKies than in a hisec belts... Those dreams were truly beautiful and they got shattered in a sec when Stratios warped to my belt. 
---
The worst thing was that feeling of being unable to do anything, I tried to ask the guy not to shoot me, but this is Eve, right? I remember yelling at him in local, he realized I was not someones alt and was truly a new player, but that didn't change anything. Writing this now I feel same anger as back then, that guy was an a-hole, no doubt. He transferred me 5mils "for my loss", I sent it him back and told him what to do with it. I felt very frustrated for a while, that's when I realized this game was not like any other games, I came back, started buying cheap stuff and blowing it up, It gets easier after you lose a lot. But that first time when you lose something special, no matter how many ISKs it costs, that hits bad... 
---
Aw man and I felt bad when I got tanked with 2 pocos in my DST...:feelsbadman
---
Make an alt and do it?
---
Thanks for the perspective.
---
50mil
---
People have tried this before.
---
There is no point because certain devs continually ignore the players and make stupid changes instead of the changes players ask for that fw needs.
---
Example:
---
A few years back FW was in a good place The only problem was warp stabbed farmers in plexes.
---
So - We asked for warp stabs not be be active once inside gates. 
---
Instead - They stopped cloaks working near the button. Something no one had asked for or even mentioned.
---
Stabbed farming became even safer and numbers doing it went out of control.
---
FW died. 
---
If you want CCP to fix FW you will need a CSM who can to hold their hand through the process because left to their own devices they will do pants on head retarded stuff while not fixing anything.
---
I mean, why didn't you take the fight? Not a wormholer btw, but it sounds like most of those dudes would have left your structure alone if you had fought. From my perspective, that seems to be what the draw of wh life is, people who will take fights, and if you're not willing to defend a structure that you say is this important to you, how can they believe you'll want to ever fight them? 
---
  
---
I'm not trying to flame you or anything here, but if fighting is not what drives you, maybe you should think about other places to live while you learn more about the game and really figure out what you enjoy in eve.
---
My impression of wormholers is, in general, they always want more people in their space, but they won't hesitate to cull the krabs if they're not giving people good fights. Maybe I'm off in my ideas, I'm sure someone will tell me if I am, but that's the vibe I get.

---
And the local, empire-specific news articles back in the day too dealing with issues specific to each of the four empires of New Eden.
---
So from what I read here:  
---
You knowingly and intentionally aligned yourself with PanFam affiliated groups, let them into the sanctity of Delve, and helped them not only make money from Delve resources but also provided them with access to supercapitals that likely would be eventually used against the Imperium.   
---
Now they've done what anyone could have imagined and turned the resources YOU provided them against you. Now you turn to Reddit to post a very self-incriminating rant in the form of a "public contract". Even in your final imgur pic (which should definitely be saved for posterity) you've outed yourself by showing that this Anure guy says he's not going to "screw you over" with Goonswarm. How could he do that if you weren't involved in stated devious act?  
---
I sincerely hope you are catapulted out of Fortress Delve. You know no one would have likely known the depth of your treachery had you not announced it to Reddit. Imperium needs intelligence. You do not seem to fit that mold.

It depends on the group. That's true of a lot of us, but it's also pretty hard to pass up a hull timer that you don't have to grind the shield and armor of. It can also be hard to muster the courage to take a fight when you can't see how you can win.
---
This is great
---
Yea they fook you up
---
I‚Äôve been out of the game for years but I can‚Äôt think of anything that can compare to what the big players in BOB felt like when the goons disbanded them and stole their name
---
We all have horrible loss stories. There is no veteran of eve (read a few years at least) that is unmarked. 
---
What sets EVE apart and what you will learn is dealing with crippling loss. When you are demoted to frigs, when your stations lie in pieces, when you see no way to recover... somehow you make it back even stronger. 
---
After my first major loss in EVE i resorted to thievery, i stole all i could, i ganked for isk, i took your loot from the DED you were doing all i could to get back up.
---
Not saying its ok.. its just what i did many years ago and i was alone. 
---
But you have your friends, build each other up, yeah sure morale sucks but this is the adventure and what builds nice stories. 
---
OH and in the future on of your friends will be a huge traitor (judging on how things happen in EVE). BRACE FOR THE FEELS
---
What adventures await you capsuleer.
---
I generally agree, however, the only true currency in Eve is time (if you're not plexing and then, absent a sugar daddy, the time is the time you spend at work) and the loss of that time is not unreasonable to be sad about... for a few minutes, then move on.

That's true, but it was anchoring, so there's not even the incentive of loot, just a structure bash on someone not willing to fight.

Tried to anchor an athanor in a c5 to do some reactions. Got scouted and died. Tried again a month later. Same thing by the same guys. Few weeks later my astra was dead and I was homeless. I was pretty upset. I shook it off, found a new home, and set up shop again. My next goal in Eve is counter evict them once I find them.

I cope with loss and failure (not just in Eve, but in general) by remembering a few quotes from my favourite book series:
---
*But if we stop, if we accept the person we are when we fall, the journey ends. That failure becomes our destination. To love the journey is to accept no such end. I have found, through painful experience, that the most important step a person can take is always the next one.*
---
*Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination.*
---
*I will take responsibility for what I have done. If I must fall, I will rise each time a better man.*
---
*As long as you keep trying, there's a chance. When you give up? That's when the dream dies.*
---
*Accept the pain, but don't accept that you deserved it.*
---
and one that feels quite fitting to eve:
---
*Plan every battle as if you will inevitably retreat, but fight every battle like there is no backing down.*

No. He wants to roam and the local response can respond by roaming like him instead of having insane privileges. Right now the privileges of locals over casual/serious roamers include but are not limited to:
---
- Structures that host titans and supers to project to whatever friendly ship in distress without any limitation.
---
- The ability to farm with tens of thousands of accounts under the same umbrella, not having to split it.
---
- Jump bridges to roam around local space freely and without jump fatigue.
---
- Cyno beacons to jump whatever system they want.
---
- Tens of citadels to use as warpoff spots.
---
- And more.
---
Now I had this conversation hundreds of times before. Let me lay it out before it happens another time.
---
You'll say there should be some advantages of having space and infrastructure. Then I'll tell you the advantages are so much that it's killing content and fun for Eve everyone. You'll ask for proof for that claim. I'll cite proliferation, PLEX prices, and other macroeconomic effects of unchecked risk-free farm. And then you'll shut your eye to the evidence and obfuscate the talk.
---
The fact that CCP allowed these new stargates to have 0 fatigue, allowed them to be anchored so close to citadels and not tether them to celestials is absolutely dumbfounding. Further reasons to see that CCP doesn't play their own fucking game.

NSH and LSH aren't associated. One is American, the other is Russian.

That's pretty accurate. I was very pleased as a Caldari that Catiz won the succession trials and many of my Amarrian friends were not.

Eve has some great lore and it's nice to see the occasional person interested about it. Unfortunately there are a lot of people who think it's uncool to actually be interested in lore and really hate on it.

If you haven't read them yet there are some good chronicles on some of the history. One of my favourites is [The Cult of Tetrimon](https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/chronicles/the-cult-of-tetrimon/). The original rulership of the Empire was through a council of equals rather than an Emperor or Empress.

Don't think there is a calendar per second, they get announced as they come up. However, the updates page does have an archive so you can see last year's events to get a decent idea of when the next annual even will be. For example, https://updates.eveonline.com/date/2018-05-06/ seems like it'll be the next one to be repeated. Doesn't account for new or irregular events, but you can scroll through previous events to work out the ones that seem yearly to get a general idea of what to expect.

Hey hyde, remember when you ditched TNT for black legion then moved back months later?

I don‚Äôt have a trick. It just takes time for me. In the meantime there‚Äôs what-ifs bouncing around my mind, doubts, second guesses, even sleepless nights. Only with time can I not care, and even then there are times the incident will pop back in mind and bring chagrin. Failure hits me hard and winning is fleeting and I struggle with it sometimes. The thing that makes the healing time go by better is being around friends who help you get back out, friends who can show you the loss isn‚Äôt a big deal.

Exploring is probably more consistent money and requires less investment when using a T1 or covops. Killing other explorers is pretty random, getting kills is the reward. Once in a while you might kill the guy carrying a full cargo of site loot. Probably the reason people like the dual-purpose astero fit (can hacking mods *and* warp disruptor) is to make money while also getting cheap kills.

It's always an option though one I would like to avoid.

You can do this without jump bridges at all, much less with fatigue or timers.

What about arena based warfare similar to the abyss one or AT? Would be sick as

Wingspan evicted us from a c2, demanded a billion a month to let us stay.  We lost pretty much everything.  Roughly 6 active players, mostly RL friends.  It sucked ass, i'm not gonna lie, bothers me to this day because there was literally nothing we could do about it.    
---
What we did learn though, is multiple stations with different timers.. Make it take weeks instead of days, most people won't bother.    
---
I didn't see anything where you tried to contact whoever evicted you.. Absolutely try that next time (there will be one).  Most wormhole people are pretty cool (fuck wingspan).    
---
Last time it happened to us, they settled for a 5 on 5.. We lost but had a good time.. Lost some ships but gained some friends, welcome to their fleets/discord.    
---
Evictions in wormhole are pretty rare unless you've developed a conflict with another large wormhole corp, but it's wormholes.. Never put anything in there you are not willing to lose.    For instance, you mentioned blueprints.  I learned, the hard way, that you research and copy BPO's in the wormhole.. Research it, make 100 copies (or whatever) and get that bpo the hell out of there.. At least stick it on an astero....    
---
Side note.. If you have a wormhole with a HS static, don't.. find something else.
---
They could (at a minimum) at least make warp disruption prevent jumping back through again.

I‚Äôm sorry you don‚Äôt understand the concept of defender advantage

It's not risk free. The risk is mitigated by the fact that people are willing to help eachother out.

The wild west version of the game where everyone backstabs everyone else as soon as they turn around is dead and gone. And CCP didn't kill it, we killed it, players killed it. Because people are smart and realize eventually that's not the best way to do things much like the real wild west advanced to the modern era where people work together.
---
If you want to keep up the small backstab everyone playstyle your also going to have to adapt to modern tactics. 
---
There's plenty of blame to go around. 
---
We usually abuse the shit out of our JBs to get ahead of roamers and set up instalocking tackle/hictor/links/dps/etc
---
Or we or someone else drop caps. 
---
But the other day a Volta Ass frig gang came through with Kiki/BI frost/saber, about 15-20 of them. We formed up an assault frig fleet to fight them. We had less ass frigs, but we had 2 scalpels. They had links, dictor, boost, and more DPS. Did they fight? Of course not. They weren't here for the gudfights, they just wanted to dunk easy kills, just like the cap pilots that we should have just let drop on them.
---
Plenty of blame to go around for the state of roaming.

Tonight I was bored, I made a terrible fit for a solo pvp cynabal and head to north from 1DQ1 in less than 20 min I was north hunting ship to die, I found my way to haven pretty fast : https://zkillboard.com/kill/75916705/ only 1 hour after I left Delve which is the other side of the world, tell me how ansiblex jump gate kill roaming ? Without it, it would have been 1 hour of travel time to only reach fade/deklein.
---
To go deeper into this, you complain about nullsec power house projecting their power, https://www.verite.space/maps/influence/influence.png do you see on this map any alliance who control a vast area of nullsec ? I know you are going to point your dirty newbie finger at me and saying "duh look GSF, SkillU, TEST or PL", those entity hold un-used region like Period Basis (fountain to an extent) for The Imperium,  almost all skillU space is renter space, Feytabolis for test and tenal and a big part of tribute/vale is PL renters. What I mean by that is beside if you attack sov of those people, you will never see PL form up because you roam with a 10 man gang in tenal, same goes if you do this in period basis etc. On a final point, I would like to remind you we are in 2019, we have a reddit post about it almost weekly but I guess you did not receive the memo, the current meta evolved under what we call "super cap umbrella" you take 1 system well placed, you setup a keepstar and you let your super/titan pilot afk on it all the day until someone get tackle and light the cyno to be saved, Ansiblex or not it doesn't matter, under that supercap umbrella you are under permanent threat, it always been like that, some are more efficient than other (like delve with thousand of player concentrate in 1 tiny region) 
---
Before Imperium recruited him, he turned traitor against SLYCE/GOTG, flipped a few small citadels and stole a few assets. Reap what you sow I suppose. 
---
The fact that players are gonna help each other doesn't specify how. They can help each other without some of the mechanics I cited above.

ECM changes completely broke the widow. It went from one of my favourite ships to something I would consider turning down if it was free.
---
It used to be workable solo mainly because it could jam the shit it dropped on to avoid getting tackled. Or if you dropped on a rattlesnake for example, you could jam his gecko and he would lose half his dps. Plus all the mids meant it tanked very hard. But it still had paltry dps and worked best when supporting other blops. When armour fit with some sebos it was very good for jamming carrier and super fighters.
---
 After the ecm changes, it has one single use and one single use only: when you stick 5 sebos in the mids with eccm scripts it becomes really difficult to probe down. That's it. Other than that it's known as the worst blops, the worst battleship, and it's fighting the caracal navy issue for the worst ship in it's weight class in the entire game.
---
It really badly needs more powergrid, bonus changed from ecm to something non shit, and better scan res, though honestly all blops really should just get covops cloak, or at the very least get a role bonus that doesn't give them a scanres penalty from the cloak.
---
I mean it is still a cost.
---
The key is to expect to loose so anytime you win is a unexpected bonus. That and being stubborn and blindly hopeful.
---
Except you can't MJD with a Falcon and it will die almost every time you engage on a carrier.
---
Judging by the comms on big USTZ TEST move ops, I'm pretty sure that being on the spectrum is a requirement...
---
&gt; When the fleet brings overwhelming odds to the field they are not looking for a fight, they are looking for an easy kill.
---
Pot meet kettle. You know they will escalate with overwhelming force if they catch you. So if you are roaming their space you are also looking for easy kills. They are not worse than you then.
---
Just from last night there were 3-4 rattlesnakes ratting in[ this pocket](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Insmother/E-95ID#npc_delta). Didn't have enough people at the time to shoot them, but I got annoyed because they wouldn't come fight to I reinforced the Ihub. As I finished spooling down they gated in two phoenix's so I peace'd out in my Geddon.
---
None of them. Get a carrier. Cheaper and better.
---
In Eve, every loss has a very real value, both in effort and isk. But the lessons learned are always more valuable than the isk. You can't recoup your effort, but now you see what extra effort you can put in for next time.
---
Probably a better way to look at it would be "don't undock in anything you're not *willing* to lose".
---
&gt; The fact that players are gonna help each other doesn't specify how.
---
It doesn't really matter in the end.
---
&gt;Everyday roams are not at all about backstabbing or politics btw.
---
It does actually, all that backstabbing was preventing people from banding together to put a stop to you getting in on the side.

Sweet thx. \o/

I find it cool that Eve in 2019 can still evoke such emotion. And like said above without that the achievements wouldn't feel as great. Beware that other games might seem bland after experiencing loss and victory in Eve.
---
Are they downvoting the idea or the worthless shittler who made the post?

Only 10mil for killing kiki leboutier not even worth logging in, what an insult

You're overpaying
---
Is it like a church retreat where someone ends up pregnant by the youth minister? 
---
The shared experiences you have with your friends are what makes make eve such an intoxicating experience.
---
Losing something you put the effort into hurts, but you got to experience it with friends.
---
If your structure onlined you would have celebrated having succeeded over the possible dangers.
---
In your despair remember its just isk. Which has value in the effort you put into it. But the real value is in the greatest ship of all..... the friendship of those you fly with.
---
Use a super carrier or titan to kill NPC capitals. Titan spawns are great for salvage sometimes. 
---
its crap UI and CCP literally made a change to stop exactly this kindof thing happening a few years ago on titans. Why not have consistency and make it so that pressing a few pixels up doesnt cause you to lose 10+bn every jump you go?
---
This shit is public and in range of Jita, its almost even against the EULA "impersonating players" but that would be a grey area
---
This will make a fine addition to my skill point pool.
---
Is this like a program that determines how pretty you are? Because I want a robot to tell me I'm a solid C
---
Okay now this is a perfectly good joke run into the ground.
---
&gt; Politics don't bar a BRAVE member from joining a Bombers Bar fleet to kill a Goonswarm super. It doesn't bar TEST from roaming into fountain and kill a Bastion Rorqual. Game mechanics do. Eve politics and diplo are mostly about keeping sov and infrastructure intact (aka NIP's). Roaming is about killing ships.
---
You've misunderstood what i meant. I meant that the state of politics earlier in the games history being unstable and backstabby meant that it was easier to slide in on the side to do roams. 
---
You should already be aware that once you are seen in someone's territory that can respond to you it's just a matter of time until they drop the hammer on you. If everyone is always feuding and backstabbing the empires will be tiny and split up meaning you can move to the next before the hammer drops on you.
---
when youre swapping alts for cynos and trying to not contract HIV from JFing its an unnecessary solution to a very simple crappy UI problem.
---
Sounds like salt to me.
---
We get holes to FRT space all the time, and I'll probably just keep entosising shit till they come fight me, so I guess if you guys want easy ihub timers around Immensea, there you go.
---
Thanks for ruining it.
---
Just gotta laugh it off, learn and rebuild. 
---
I will double any isk given to anyone.
---
This entire thread to be exact
---
&gt; I don't know how to feel. 
---
Months to afford the structure in question, didn't have the numbers or skill to defend it, didn't even have the will to put up a fight for fun/to earn respect, are lamenting that you were "not be even able to do a thing." Sounds like you basically bit off more than you could chew and were hoping luck would carry you through?
---
You should be trying to learn from your (apparently many) mistakes. Falling back to carebear space might be the fix, but I doubt it'd help you as much as reflecting with your buds about what you did, why you wanted to do it, what went wrong; asking other WH folks (even the guys who killed your shit) how you can do better next time; and trying again but while remembering the number 1 rule in Eve applies to anything you can't afford to lose, not just to a ship.

Protip: before joining a group always check how many killmails the corp gets around your timezone. Steady amount of kills show that they are active at the time you are most likely playing Eve.
---
&gt;  I meant that the state of politics earlier in the games history being unstable and backstabby meant that it was easier to slide in on the side to do roams.
---
I didn't misunderstand. Your point is wrong. Any alliance has some space to roam. So roaming/defense mechanics are not about politics.
---
&gt; it's just a matter of time
---
The question is how much time. Right now, it's instant, due to supercap umbrella mechanics. If there is enough time, then ships can begin to die again. E.g. we kill supers in Delve by stalling help for 3-4 minutes. But it relies on industrial level afk camping, which is too high a bar for anyone to get into the super-killing game. So, to lower that bar, game mechanics need to change.
---
&gt; If everyone is always feuding and backstabbing
---
This meme you're stuck with has nothing to do with anything at all in this thread, nor with Eve history btw.
---
When I first started out I moved into low sec pretty quickly. Spent my time mining in a venture. Took about 2 weeks but I filled up a hauler with an estimated 100 million in refined minerals and undocked for Jita.
---
Was taught by the corp to always leave our space into low sec off a Fort facing the gate. Only problem was there was another player undocked in an adjacent fort. We had a stand off for about 30 minutes of docking and undocking. 
---
At some point I just said fuck it and warped to the gate. "There is no way he will be able to catch my align time into High Sec." Unfortunately back then no one taught me what an interdiction drag bubble was. I slipped off the gate, scrammed and podded.
---
I was screaming! I couldn't believe what just happened. The last two weeks were gone just like that ... WASTED. I will never forget that night. Turns out the corp would have bought the haul for the Jita price in our home system. I wasn't using the resources available to me. All I had to do was ask someone in the corp about my situation. I just assumed that I knew what I was doing. Truth is, I didn't back then. I still don't really know what I am doing. Time is the most valuable resource in this fragile game. 
---
I wanted to quit but I knew if I did, then the other guy would have won. I told everyone what happened and aside from the laughter they all told me, shit happens that's the game we play. If not you then someone else. Couple months back we caught a hauler during a roam worth 6 Billion. That moment really put things into perspective for me. Today is you, tomorrow it's someone else.

Would that solve the problem

at least the other guy lost isk too *shrug*

So bring two and warp before getting blapped.

Its not traffic thats the issue. Its that most isk making activities are way to safe and its tough to catch people anymore

You could achieve the same thing by fitting a lot of damage mod on low slot
---
We all have to start somewhere. Cheers

A Widow is still more effective for all the things I just listed above. A Falcon (or two) that drops on a carrier at the hunters range is going to fucking die. An NSA lets you target a Falcon almost immediately and murder it. There's no burn time for the fighters, there's no escape mechanic for the falcon. It's going to get Alpha'd by missiles/Turret in 1-2 volleys pretty easily. The Widow easily has a role right now, people are just determined to shit on things that they don't have any relative experience with. It could definitely use some love, but calling it useless (especially in the context that I provided) is fucking dumb.

Ugh... I feel like this is an unpopular opinion but as far as I am concerned this is a zero-effort piece of actual trash. It's literally just a pattern decal thrown haphazardly onto the ship with a gradient. It's even distorted weirdly, stretched around the edges, because they couldn't be bothered to project it in a way that matches the UV map. This is a twenty-minute job in substance painter and a bad one at that. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I understand that effort put into a skin doesn't directly correlate with it's quality, but this looks like a fan skin by a student artist still in the process of learning digital art. With no background in any other type of art. And while I don't prefer them, I also don't have anything in particular against "simple pattern" skins. The victory or metamateria skins would be piss-easy to replicate, for instance, but at least they have some artistic integrity from a design standpoint, with enough respect for the customer to *click the fucking checkbox to use the proper projection method for the UV map they're fucking using*.

I joined Minmatar FW 2-3 years before we ever took full control of our warzone for the 1st time. Our underdog status &amp; the idea of earning the 1st ever Minmatar medal was a huge motivator. Eventually we got serious momentum going, and a ***lot*** of people were fully in the grind each day. Within a year or so we went from controlling 0 systems to controlling all but 2-3, but we just couldn't push it over the top.

I was a loner starting out in Eve and that level of community participation made me fall in love with the game on whole new levels (not to mention all the great fleet pvp content). It really hurt to slowly fall back after coming so close to accomplishing something so big for the 1st time
---
Highsec, you know what that is right?
---
&gt;You know they will escalate with overwhelming force if they catch you.
---
I know they will if they can (or maybe I won‚Äôt, who knows). The whole point of that portion is how much they can escalate, how quickly, and where. Why do you think the OP mentions the decision to use a skirmish ship as opposed to something heavier.
---
I‚Äôve had this happen to myself numerous times before, some fights won, some lost. Often enough it may come down to taking a fight, letting it unfold, and then making that decision to run when the time comes. Basic combat decisions and tactics haven‚Äôt gone away. The problem is that some choices are simply too easy or advantageous that they quickly end the fun part of PvP. 
---
&gt;So if you are roaming their space you are also looking for easy kills...
---
Apparently leaving your home field advantage behind to go hunting on someone else‚Äôs turf is ‚Äúeasy‚Äù now? From the sound of it, if I want easy kills I just need to stay home and wait for some poor dude to come roaming through so I don‚Äôt have to do much work or take much risk. 
---
	The Mighty Beans
---
My advice is all of u should join faction war for a bit, more money than wh, way less risk, more fun, and it will teach u to pvp, a necessary skill in eve
---
You spend real time doing something, that's real.  Think of all the bullshit real jobs people have that makes or breaks their mood.

Im confused.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b69j12/lowsechnaya\_sholupen\_a\_public\_contract/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b69j12/lowsechnaya_sholupen_a_public_contract/)

It's called 'overheating'.

Hi I need instructions on how to cure my crippling alcoholism with vodka. Pls hurry. 
---
&gt; Apparently leaving your home field advantage behind to go hunting on someone else‚Äôs turf is ‚Äúeasy‚Äù now?

If you are only interested in engaging targets that don't/won't/can't fight back yes.
---
&gt;From the sound of it, if I want easy kills I just need to stay home and wait for some poor dude to come roaming through so I don‚Äôt have to do much work or take much risk.
---
If your home territory has ratting pockets that attract low effort gankers yes.
---
Not sure if serious, but https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Jump_drives

Astero is the best explo ship out there. If you can afford to lose it and can fit a cov ops cloak, do buy it. You'll love fall in love with it in no time.
---
Santo is a legend!
---
Under a solid umbrella people could probably host the kind of arena events yall are talking about. There's always potential for disruption but thats what makes EVE what it is
---
sad attempt is right :\^)
---
Or delete fatigue
---
I've had some big losses as well that stuck with me for days. Feels pretty bad, but that's what this game is about sometimes.
---
Going forward though, sounds like you guys got in way over your head and didn't take the proper precautions to secure your investment. Do your research before the next step because I can guarantee you this same situation will happen again and again unless you learn from you mistakes and get better at covering your ass.
---
Instant undock bookmarks make it almost impossible, especially with a blockade runner.

I'm all about implementing changes to EVE in general and FW specifically.  I just don't like the Elite FW system, even as broken as EVE FW is I've spent the better part of a decade playing with a FW alliance in EVE.  I couldn't stand the Elite version for even a month.  
---
It doesn't help that your suggestion focuses specifically on expanding the amount of PVE content in FW.  I've felt strongly for years now that CCP should \*reduce\* the NPC presence in FW.  I don't want to fight more NPCs in FW, I want to fight more players.  
---
I enjoyed the some of the core gameplay of Elite, but on a boredom level everything about the game world and my interactions with it felt more sterile and less impactful than EVE.  On top of that, as a lore nerd / roleplayer in EVE I've watched some of the storyline development and player interaction in Elite with dismay.  CCP hasn't done the best job engaging with the RP / lore community in recent years... but holy hell I'll take what they have done over the kind of blatantly terrible player interaction events Elite has had.
---
You can probably get some rigs for that
---
He‚Äôs still fcing and leading Tri. Tri is doing pretty well in Pure Blind as far as I can tell.
---
I miss being in Tri/No Mercy.
---
Oy vey!  Shut it down!
---
Big loss. Well. Big is relative. I've had to learn how to deal with loss since my first week.
---
I got ganked in a miasmos while autopiloting through uedama. I had *zero* clue what I'd done wrong. Totally perplexed, I wasn't sure if I could keep playing if it meant I'd be constantly getting killed like that. Then people told me about suicide ganking, why you don't autopilot, etc. This gave me enough information that I could start figuring out solutions to the problem myself. I went *down* that rabbit hole and came out the other side with a much better idea of how to play.
---
Later, I did more stupid things. I've lost bigger, better and more expensive ships since then. There were three lessons I learned in the process that have stood the test of time:
---
1. I will always make stupid mistakes. I treat them as lessons to be learned from.
---
2. Have a spare ship and fit ready to go in a dock somewhere when you lose the one you're flying. It makes life much easier when your primary source of income goes boom if you have *another* one.
---
3. If you can't afford to lose it, then you can't use it.
---
This is the hard truth. Sucks to say, but if you get that bent over a loss like that, you probably shouldn't have made the jump to WH space. Especially if you don't have 2-3 backup POS/Citadel whatever's sitting in a station somewhere ready to go.
---
It's the age old adage in Eve, if you can't afford to lose it and replace it without worry, you shouldn't undock it, and probably shouldn't even own it.
---
1. Making eve more tedious in 2019 maybe isn't the best idea. I would personally be ok with the idea that you have to freight everything through lowsec via gates to null or use wormholes and ban JF's in empire. Not many will agree :D
---
2. FW already has cynojammers in each system. Inside and outside of plexes. You can go there if you want to avoid cynos. It's not even hard you just have to activate the acceleration gate.
---
3. Poco system is ok. Not worth using dev time upgrading it. There are more serious issues.
---
4. You want to increase profits in FW? You want more farmers there than there currently is? I just checked current LP value for different militias: Caldari 1700 isk per lp, Amarr 2600 isk per lp, Minmatar 1005 isk per lp, Gallente 1010 isk per lp. For example in Caldari militia at tier 2 you earn 45k LP for 2 smalls and a novice. That's 45k x 1700 = 76.5mil isk. And thats selling the stuff straight to buy orders in Jita. You get even more if you make sell orders. I would say that is good income for a newer player in a t1 frigate. How much more you want to get???
---
5. If you want coordination you can just coordinate more. Contact the different CEO's. Thats how we did it back in the day. More rewards will just bring more farmers. FW is still extremely good place to print isk.
---
6. There are other groups living in FW space than just militia players. Making their game more annoying because of system they care nothing about is stupid. That will just make people hate on FW even more. FW should give slight bonus to militia players but none of the restrictions. That way you would get new people to join FW. That way even some of the smaller pirate groups might join FW if there is no annoying restrictions (for example can't dock into enemy npc stations in lowsec wtf. You can dock in highsec totally fine).
---
7. Agreed that it was sad to see pos moon mining go. But I don't think you can fix it that way. It's more complex.
---
I have no clue how it is done..

I think a loss should hurt. The trick is not to wallow in it. *Use it.* Make that hurt motivate you to learn what went wrong so you won't make that mistake again.
---
Tactel Vyvorant here. Im in to help fight for FW.
---
If you do decide to stick with faction, bhaal is also cheap as dirt compared to the others, so keep that in mind.
---
Yeah, 'FAST' into the dumpster.
---
Goot to see WHSOC is still finding content. 
---
Soooo much wrong with your post, but I'm going to focus on your "not on grid with a citadel". These are a direct replacement for Jump Bridges, which are anchored at a POS, which citadels are the direct replacement of. So they would need to be anchored next to something, in fact, Jump Bridges were much closer to safety than current Ansiblex gates.
---
As far as fatigue. Fatigue was a mistake to introduce to start with. Without fatigue, we never would have had the current proliferation of Capitals and Supercapitals as they can now be built in relative safety. The full removal will cause groups to be able to project, and lose, capital assets on a much grander scale, which is good for the game, especially our struggling economy.
---
1M for slicer but 2M for Condor?
---
&gt;If you are only interested in engaging targets that don't/won't/can't fight back yes. 
---
So the fact that the other player has access to the same tools that I do AND has home field advantage means that if i catch a defenseless target it was easy? 
---
&gt;If your home territory has ratting pockets that attract low effort gankers yes. 
---
So its the defender's lack of effort that makes the kills easy, am I right here? 
---
But I think we've missed my point here long enough so I'll make this simple:
---
&gt; Sounds like you just want soft ratter targets and not people actually prepared to fight you. 
---
I made my statement to point out that you were never going to give them a fight. Saying "you just want easy kills" while defending a group trying to kill that same person easily, is a double standard. 
---
Removing fatigue completely would do so much for the economy as you would see Capitals dying again, and less citadel spam possibly to boot. Now, folks just hide out in there safe spaces and build at will, and mine at will, lowering prices on goods across New Eden. 
---
Let's get the economy back on track, Vote Yes on Propsition Fuckfatigue.
---
Death to all the OTWs
---
I‚Äôll pay anyone 30 mil who puts OTW at the end of their name 
---
Tetgter to celestials? What? Why? The Jump Bridges had to be on grid with a POS, a citadel is the replacement to the POS. It makes sense to be at a citadel.
---
Remove fatigue completely btw.
---
These are reasons to see why you shouldn't make decisions about the game.
---
tl;dr:  CCP wants ur resub.
---
Especially since he has zero clue about space politics, or, well, anything else really lol.
---
Holy shit was that dumb.
---
&gt;I made my statement to point out that you were never going to give them a fight. Saying "you just want easy kills" while defending a group trying to kill that same person easily, is a double standard.
---
You are trying to switch our positions here. This was never my position on this issue. My point was has been and continues to be if you roam into a space you know will out escalate you (aka you don't plan on staying and fighting the response force) how are you any different from them? If you run away when more force is presented that would crush you, how is that any different from when you bemoan all the VNI haven spinners for docking up when you come in?
---
Best one of these so far.
---
The biggest loss to me was getting kicked from my Corp for inactivity (left for work travel) and being too afraid to come back to eve because there's too much anxiety in finding a new Corp or rejoining my old one. If it is still even alive that is. All this second and third level account validation and interviews and shit kills the game for me, I deal with enough social anxiety IRL lol.
---
I think before that, sometime in the first month or so after the game launched. Keep in mind I had actually played in the beta for quite some time before launch, it was my first time hauling stuff for profit. I had earned a bunch of money in hi sec, enough to get myself a shiny new iteron (I think it was an iteron) I got ransomed, and didn't have the money to pay, so was blown away and podded.
---
Texas Law
---
Fatigue should not be removed completely, otherwise we end up in the same paradigm that we ended up in during 2013-2015. I don't know if you remember that, but that was a pretty shitty time to play in; even with reduced jump ranges, fatigue has been a deciding mechanic that a lot of others have been designed around.
---
And yes, tether these new stargates to moons or celestials, away and offgrid from citadels. The difference between the old POS JB system and the new citadel defense battery is that the POS was *NEVER* able to put out the DPS that it could on a target. Stargates are controlled by Fortizars which when anticap fit evaporate dreads, something that could be managed or mitigated before. Not to mention being able to project their damage out to ludicrous ranges, but sure, that's okay. 
---
Sounds like one of the fleets I was leading.. We jumped In to a WH and found a anchoring structure while waiting for our out hole to be scanned.. Needless to say we killed it..
---
Sorry not sorry. 
---

---
That was my first big Corp/alliance too lol, GFS was too big for my liking, makes it a little difficult to make bonds imo
---
Damn Hyde, boutta get them toes sucked my friend. My last offer in PFP still stands.
---
Also thanks for my Nyx! o7
---
&gt; in the hands of relatively newer/k-space based pilots. 
---
So, you're saying you evicted a newer corp in wormhole space because they dropped a carrier on you when you tried to actively invade their home. Bahahaha the irony is that you fucking retards were the ones complaining when HK was evicting people. 
---
What is the reasoning for evicting wormholers that are willing to risk assets to fight / defend their system?
---
Yeah but we still love you anyway
---
Wtb new source in goons to supply cheap titans
---
Thanks...
---
Agreed
---
See the Brave alliance and the coalition have big numbers too, a lot of people don‚Äôt like Test from our coalition just like a lot of people don‚Äôt like Goons but that‚Äôs normal.
---
However there‚Äôs 2 main things that attracted me in Brave, they‚Äôre kinda bag but it feels more like a tight knit community, in the standing fleet there‚Äôs always bunch of regulars that you‚Äôll always interact with and very easy to bond.
---
Second thing is, I did a reddit search on Brave before joining and I loved how respected they were and literally stood up for their name, Brave. We take on any fights, go on rescues no matter the numbers and always have a good time, that being said people always pass by our space for a good little braw and we always end our fights with gf o7, excluding the occasional salty tard which we avoid.
---
I think that we should install one of those on your reddit account and then activate it 
---
Well, GG Hyde.
---
Hyde if you read this i like 100 bill for NDA, or I leak ;)
---
didn't ask
---
ill give you 1b to leak
---
NJED came in for some content to shoot things, since their numbers were much higher than us around the clock and it was something we could likely have some good fights with. We did not decide to evict BECAUSE of capitals. We wanted to pew them because of capitals and activity levels.
---
WHSOC changed the game for us. We were already here to shoot things, so we jumped on and went for it. If we didn't have both of us, we'd likely have lost that POS fight as well. 
---
We left a Raitaru (where nearly everything was evacc'd to), so this wasn't a complete eviction regardless. We had fun. Locals had fun. All is well.
---
oof

&gt; **Shield Tank Kestrel. What do yall think?** 
---
This is not a good PvE fit. Here you go dude, all Tech I alpha / newbie friendly. Replace any of the T1 with T2 modules if you have the skills. In this particular setup the small shield extender for the purpose of the ship is OK. Keep it, you will need the little bit of buffer it provides. You can replace it with a medium if you have the spare powergrid / cpu, but since you are asking about stuff like this then you most likely do not have your skills high enough for that. 
---
If you want to save some PG/CPU then replace the Monoprepellant AB with a Compact AB, but then you will have less time to run your shield booster because it will eat more cap while active. This little ship can do level 1 and level 2 security missions as well as the low end DED sites and equivalent difficulty content. It is a bit of a kiting ship, you basically kill your targets at the tip of your weapons / ammo range while doign wide orbits and keeping up your transversals. The shield booster does not last very long before you run out of cap, so only use it when things are going bad and you need the extra tank or inbetween waves when you can turn off your AB and hardener and run the booster to get your shield up to full pretty quick while not draining cap.
---
During combat, keep your AB and hardener always on, the booster is to be operated as outlined above.

You could've baited out more cap kills and then left them rebuild a bit, instead you guys just killed off a new corp to j-space for the loot and you're trying to bullshit some excuse about mass recruitment and tax lmao. 
---
I believe SEADC was the main cause of the escalations. Heaven's Angel's were good guys and if it was just them, this may never had happened. Majority of the online pilots saved their valuable assets in the Raitaru or evac'd it.

Maybe I dont understand where you get the idea that someone who doesn't want to worthlessly throw away a ship cant possibly be looking for a fight. Nor can I understand how you consider that to be a fight. If its not a fight you're bringing, then of course they will avoid you, just like every other sane person.

---
Hijinks and shenanigans, in EVE? Why I never!
---
That's my point. VNI haven spinners don't want to lose their ship because bored pvpers came into their system and there weren't any other targets. And you, bored pvpers don't want to lose your ships because yet bigger fish even than you are bored and there aren't any other targets.
---
212906?
---
&gt; bored pvpers don't want to lose your ships because yet bigger fish even than you are bored and there aren't any other targets. 
---
You are being intentionally binary. can you possibly think of literally any other situation between helpless krabber and overwhelming force? Maybe somewhere in the middle possibly?
---
&gt; Maybe somewhere in the middle possibly?
---
You would engage a PVE VNI not knowing if you could actually kill it?
---
Had a ton of fun and made awesome friends at the one that I did go to. 
---
The solution to this is the triple neut torpedo marshal.  Any blops with 2 neuts is competitive to the sin and generally you want just pure neuting strength for the majority of things you're dropping on anyway (outside of BR space üòâ).  
---
You also get the added utility of the marshal's great omni base resists and extreme tank potential, lots of slots for utility, 3.3au/s warp speed and insane fitting room.
---
But the Sin is the OG Autism Chariot and has too much history behind it for most people to stop using it.

You can spin it all you like. Long story short, you did exactly what we did. When we did it you kicked up a fuss, now the boots on the other foot and suddenly "it's cuz er, muh whsoc did it"
---
Grow a backbone and admit you just evicted for the sake of evicting.
---
Nah man, think of the loot! Forget about those new people in wormholes who actively shoot at the attackers pos in resistance!
---

shame, these guys fought good when we tackled their rorq awhile ago :(
---
Boy oh boy do I love a good drama. Even better knowing it‚Äôs Hydex. The dude baiscally burned every bridge he‚Äôs ever built by being the Smugiest-Smuglord the game has possibly ever seen 
---
This happened a really long time ago. A mate from a corp/alliance I was previously in got to building his WH corp. Asked me to join. I did, somehow reluctant, but I trusted the dude a lot so why not. Unfortunately we were both quite green at WH life, which was fair at that time (we were both nullbears for a while, then I dabbled in lowsec PvP then I was just chilling around so to speak.
---
I first joined some ops to see what's up and stuff and it seemed to be p. good. So decided to move in with a bunch more stuff, pick up some of the corps stuff in the process and head into the WH for a permanent residence.
---
The WH was a C3 with a C4 static. Nothing too fancy, but it was always a chore since we didn't always have a hole towards k-space, so logistics were a bit complicated. I decided to get my freighter in on my alt since my main couldn't into transport ships and what not. This was before freighters had any fitting slots.
---
My friend escorts me in, helping with webbing me for quicker warp entrance.
---
Got blapped on a hole with a Loki and a Proteus. My friend's stealthy Tengu didn't stand a change - he actually made it out. I wasn't really mad, cutting losses is a thing. In hindsight, that cloaky Tengu of his should've sported jammers, but what's done is done and we are all made of stardust (just as the hard earned 7 bil on the lossmail including ship :D).
---
A while later, one of the corp directors stole everything not nailed down and rabbited. My friend was actually closer friends with that director. Idk how he took it, but corp and alliance disbanded a while after. Left a sour taste in my mouth not because of the freighter - and other losses incurred in this whole adventure - but because a close friend decided to burn bridges and fuck everybody over less than 20 bil or so.
---
Tl;dr: ISK is temporary, always was, always will. Friendships are forever. Go with the latter and you can build anything, anywhere, under any circumstances. Yes, your station was blapped, it happens. But you guys are still together, yes? If not, perhaps it was not meant to be. Chin up and move on.
---
Hmm tea or coffee this morning? 
---
I used to not even try to undock tackle when Abkiller used to fly slicers more. Just felt pointless. 
---
Over a year ago a (highsec) corp I was in had its citadel stolen. CEO was a nut for putting this one down as it overstretched our infrastructure. I left the corp as we already had structure related drama before already and started a new one (which officially didn't mine) with a bunch of people I grew fond of over my time in that corporation.
---
I can feel your disappointment, sometimes we not just get sucker punched, but also whacked on the head with a baseball bat. Of course its frustrating, but the bottom line is; it's business expenses.
---
Guardian OTW, this guy is actually insane
---
Fellow "Kitey *ags" Exodus. are happy to help :)
---
And the key to what /u/FisherKelEve said is NEW PLAYERS. Oh my God new players.
---
Fucking around in frigates, not knowing what you're doing, getting blown up--it's the most fun you can have when you're just starting out (and it's a lot of fun). If new players got dumped into a lively and relatively balanced FW they'd be more likely to see what Eve is all about and stick around for a minute.
---
SEADC and Heaven's Angel's are the same entity as I understand it.
---
But why not just nut yourself over the cap kills and let them live to fight another day?
---
I don't understand how "they dropped caps on us"  leads to "we're evicting them".
---
huh? chill out dude
---
The module search functionality appears to be broken on Note9. Strangely I could search for ships when creating the fit but not modules once a ship was selected.
---
theses dank leaks are worth more than a bill
---
&gt; wormhole space is dead
---
&gt; theres no people to fight, lets evict people to fight
---
repeat
---
1.1b
---
I‚Äôll also throw in a bill. Now spill the beans 
---
So the years of the game working properly with training while out of game and time being a resource is dead.  People joke about Eve being dead or dying but this really is the slow end.  
---
Old players love the game but the turnover for older players coming back is high. I think everyone needs to accept the fact that Eve is just another pay to "win" MMO.  
---
RIP.

The most 'OH COME ON, REALLY?!' loss I've had so far was leaving High-grade Slave set in Horde Perimeter fortizar and going afk for 6 month. Even still playing while X47 happened I had no idea someone would contest horde in Hisec in nearest future. Goddamit TEST ;D
---
10/10, would doorstop at 3:00am for you again in the future.
---
&gt; We hope to see you guys on more even terms in the future!
---
Then why evict them
---
Also worth noting that they heavily nerfed the 'unscannability' of T3Cs, so you can't get them to be as difficult to probe as they used to be (at least I'm pretty sure, haven't needed to dust off my Virtues after the off-grid links removal).
---
This is a really convoluted way to brag about blobbing an active upcoming wormhole PVP entity out of existence because you're a retard.
---
Well what do you know, disregarding all the positives people will still find a reason to complain about something, anything..
---
My opinion is still the same tho, Eve has one of the best communities I‚Äôve ever seen, apart from the occasional drama but that‚Äôs normal.
---
With no timers and a successful emergency warp I still think it takes 1.5 mins for the ship to actually disappear, during which time they can be aggressed.

1 carrier with T2 fighters or a squad of 4-6 VNIs can kill the NPC dreads and Carriers. Faction Spawn (Dread Guristas, True Sansha, Dominion, etc), need 2-3 carriers to kill effectively though.
---

All due respect Eve would have been much worse off if we didn't complain.

We even have free Enyos

Focus on smaller ships to start with, BCs require way too much sp to be useful in. IMO, pick a T2 frigate to specialize in, and train everything for it (support skills, capacitor, etc), then pick another. Then train t2 medium weapons of your choice and train cruiser 5. Advance from there specializing in faction, then pirate and T2 cruisers.

Like the dread equivalent of Shadow fighters? What you've described is basically a hull energizer and while overheating. You're almost always going to die after the hull energizer ends anyway so what's the difference between heating your guns until they burn while your energizer is up?

Start with shield power relays in lows, when you land in a room, drop your mobile depot and orbit it at 1000 with the AB on. As you start killing rats, switch out your shield power relays for drone damage amps. Wasps will tear up anything but I'd recommend using them for things close by that your sentries can't track, mainly use sentries. Stabs are in cargo for travel, totally optional.

I'm not a solo expert by a long shot, but get rid of one of the tanks (mixed tank is not the way to go), and put some damage or tracking mods in their place. This will up your dps enough that you may be able to kill them quicker. Also, get into T2 guns asap, it is not a long train for the smalls.
---
Again, I'm not an expert, just some things that I have learned over the years.
---
With respect to that linked lossmail, swap the Ancillary _Armor_ Repairer for a Gyrostabilizer. You'll get a 20%-24% damage boost depending on what one you fit. 
---
i imagine, bob and anure being friends, these leaks wouldn't have been posted if anure were still getting supers from hydex

Pretty sure they still have metrics to reach to get the rest of their payout, I'm sure logins are part of that.

Oh come on, when I have to roam around GE- and V-3 for more than an hour, solo, on a Friday, for anyone to even undock I know damn well that's not a jump gate problem.

Also, focus on teaching yourself proper range-control. That's the key to making sure your shots land well, and your opponent's _don't_.

We already KNOW that CCP has to meet certain metrics to get the other half of their PA payout, so its not really speculation.  We don't know the exact terms, but X number of logins and concurrent players are generally metrics that are used for this type of thing.

Politics may not directly stop an FC forming a fleet and going into neutral space and bashing things. What it does is create situations where the big, strong groups can ally with each other, becoming stronger and and gaining large parts of space, keeping them protected and thus attracting more people. The situation then snowballs and instead of a lot of small groups that can put together a small response fleet and spark interesting fights you get the supercap umbrellas and 150 man f1 fleets everyone is complaining about. So, in the end, politics does very much matter.
---
Only if you say it is. 
---
This springs to mind...
---
https://i.imgur.com/fCy7PKE.jpg
---
The question is not whether politics matters. The question is whether it matters with respect to roaming. 
---
All groups have space to roam in no matter their politics. So is CCP going to implement mechanics to make roaming harder, or easier; and reversely, will defending one's local space remain this much easy for a mega alliance, or are we gonna begin to talk about how game-breakingly easy it is? Again, these questions have nothing to do with Eve politics, and neither this thread.
---
&gt; demand for plex even at current prices is big enough that it‚Äôs just going to keep going up until some sales happen
---
I think it is this. Lot of people is plexing multiple Rorq alts (not mentioning someone has to plex all those bot accounts) and it has to be seen somewhere. 
---
The funny thing is nc dotte has deployed 3 times and failed.
---
I use one extractor per planet most of the time. on a daily pull I usually pull up 1mil of units which can be processed by 8 basic factories in 24 hours.  so it goes. 8 headed extractor to storage, to 8 factories then to launch pad. I'm lucky enough to own my pocos so 0% tax. From there I take the p1 to my main factory planet on each character. It took a while to set it up but its a complicated 4p1 to 1p3 setup. This works well on timing, because the processing time for 4 full launchpads of p1 goods is 4 days which is the same amount of time it usually takes to fill up the launchpad on each of the 4 mining planet. The p3s then go to a single p4 planet which is on one character and they have to load and empty this one everyday. so thats per character 4mineing planets 1 factory and 1 spare, usually mining of the less productive p0 goods.

Glad that's out of the way. Dual tanks is really quite common for 1v1 set ups. Breacher for example will often run an ancil shield and armor repper.  
---
However, the more common tanks are structure tank rigs + ancil armor repper.  
---
For the actual advice to the OP - go to zkill and look at the thrasher (if that's what you want to fly...it's a great ship). Look at a couple pages of killmails and see who is using them and using them effectively. Steal one of their fits, examine it, and try to figure out how they are using it. Kiting with arties? Brawling with autos?  
---
Don't recreate the wheel - Eve has been out long enough that it has been min-maxed to shit. If you are just starting out you don't need to innovate.  
---
Also don't listen to Bo\_Hunt about anything.

Its worth pointing out that CCP have equal if not more "designers" to "developer" ratios ...

---
Plus, SEADC, as mentioned &amp; per my own assessment too, don't help their newbros much.
---
HK &amp; other bigger groups can evict others and 'some shit' for it. Small/Medium corps "invading" others........"Big No!! You're the reason w-space is empty/dying"....while the rest of you krabs own 5+ C5/6 wh's for krabbing and can't even defend your own homes after years of evictions.

It has a meaning as the context for a loss of 20+B isk that is not a structure, not a pvp intended ship, nor a risky pve  situation like abyss running. I made effort for a length as an investment for future, had a weird connection to the ship, then lost it too soon. Seems to me like a possible hurtful loss that can bring about an answer of coping to the OPs question.

This is a very good example of why many people do not bother with WH space in that a new entity gets taken for 67bn ISK.    Did you give them enough time to krab up before doing this?   Does not look like it...
---
From when I used to do a lot more roaming than I do now, the whole point of killing the vnis (which is hideously boring btw, like I don‚Äôt think anybody actually enjoys killing them) was to draw out some sort of sub cap response force that we could then fight, and yeah we were normally out numbered 5-1 but at least with the right brawl Comp or just hella fast ships we could fight that and even get out alive. That‚Äôs the fight we talk about, it doesn‚Äôt need to be even we just want a chance to kill something( I don‚Äôt speak for everyone and maybe some people are just shitters who want free kills but the group I flew with was always happy to die in a good fight)
---
These days though it‚Äôs just cyno baiting everything with supers piling in, and to expect small groups to suddenly have a 200 man dread bomb (which is still not all that effective as we saw with test, but can be effective if you do everything right as we saw with snuff) is an incredibly high bar to set for some simple fun pvp.
---
 ‚ÄúLet me tell you something you already know. The  world ain't all sunshine and rainbows.

Is this a copypasta? You admit to essentially moving panfam assets through delve and then try to screw them over using reddit, which is mostly either imperium or panfam aligned people, neither of which will help you due to information you provided in this very post.

The secret to staying in the game long-term is getting right back in there and trying again. Persistence wins in the long run even against stronger foes.

Good luck and don't let it get you down!
---
Also, my biggest loss so far was a 10b Rorqual that died to 69 goon bombers, and tanked 4.5+ million damage. But I've lost a lot of carriers and dreads too over the last few years as well as various structures in my home systems. Thankfully no Supers... yet. I'll fly and lose one eventually. :)
---

Yoooo hit me up with that man. Mine only has (not at all) spicy chicken sandwiches and questionable meat burgers. Sometimes they bring out the school lunch pizza too
---
OOF ... that hurts ... deeply.
---
You made me think. You are right. 
---
Take his balls out of your mouth you cockwomble. As someone who does evict people and is doing it as we type, leaving one Raitaru and burning all their other assets to the point they're self destructing out; this was still an eviction.
---
I stopped reading after the first point. If your idea of 'content' is shooting freighters and industrials then go join PIRAT or something, you don't belong in FW space.

---
Biggest loss?
---
Hum
---
Been playing this game on and off for just over a decade now
---
For the past 3 years or so, losses meant nothing to me
---
Just pixels
---
However when I was more invested in the game the hardest loss was probably 8 or so years ago losing my Maelstrom to falling asleep at the computer during a Level 4 Mission.
---
That was the first real hit to the gut.
---
After that, really did not care about losses much however the ping would still happen
---
A decade later, I have whelped so many ships with ridiculous fits without a care in the world
---
Most recent I can think of is losing my mission running Machariel to a DC (only way i was plexing my account besides another mission running Tengu)
---
Just shrugged it off and called it a day for Omega account unless a friend gifts me play time
---
However, most of my friends no longer actively play
---
That is the biggest loss;
---
Not being able to share in laughter over the batshit crazy engagements I would yolo into Because of not caring about losses
---
So biggest loss in EvE for me?
---
Friendship lmao
---
Only took a decade to get there
---
Thank you for sharing your perspective it definitely helps. But let me share mine: 
---
I suck at pvp. I'm trying to learn the ropes. To do that i need isk to buy ships to whelp learning the whys the whats and the hows. And when your curb stomping the skulls of my fellow vni ratters i see that happening to me. And how much it would suck to see my income stream cut off because i bought a battleship to try out instead of more cheap ships and am low on funds at the moment. 
---
So from my perspective you come in cap some of my fellows, something that i know could cripple me if i didn't get out in time and by the time i reship into something that can stand and fight you are gone. Or sometimes you use your comms spies and flee the instant people start suggesting forming stuff to fight back. That's my experience on the receiving end of your roaming.
---
It's bad to assume safety in eve, you may get away with it once or twice but if you're not prepared with ample defenses for an anchoring citadel that mattered so much to you, then you pay the price for it. 
---
Eve is a tough game mate, you make one mistake and you get punished brutally. Sometimes even if you are prepared and think that you have everything under control, something unexpected happens and your glass castle gets shattered into pieces. That's the game we all love, that's the game we are so passionate about.
---
I have lost a silver magnate, and an imp. Imp loss kinda hurt because I lost it to a server issue and never it back. So it was a rough loss to get over. The silver magnate I lost to my own stupidity and I understood that right when it happened so wasn't even upset about it. Rip 200bil
---
One time i lost a 2b pod and 1 b mach because I didn't safe log. It was upsetting.
---
Then my friend sent me his smart bomb kill mail for a 4.5b pod on the same day and it was in our corp. So that made my day feel a bit better.
---
Why a meta membrane
---
me and my brother share same account as i said he created this account for me
---
 I actually found fighter control simple while I had a nyx
---
I too was surprised to hear all the Sholupens weren‚Äôt Russian. In b4 Archtang Partizanen (aka action parmesan) is rebooted by Mexicans.  
---
Yes
---
Don't forget that the Chinese server shut down late last year and they moved to TQ, so you'd expect that to buoy up the numbers a bit.
---
Hey, only some of us are useless!
---
Artificially increased higher numbers are.  
---
It also means it is harder to differentiate between increased player count because of changes that are good for the game (looking at that last patch) and the inflated numbers.  
---
Still I don't think that the free SP are bad (obviously :P) and it gets some people hooked for a while (if they are doing more than just pressing "log in" on 3 days).  
---
Overall increased real player numbers are obviously a good thing.  
---
Also if anyone thinks that they are trying to fool PA or that PA would fall for it I recommend checking if you forgot to put points into intelligence after the last neural remap.
---
I cannot fight zis
---
Throw my keyboard through my PC screen, walk off, kick a frog and then return to do it all again.. pretty typical I would say

If the station is still there you might be in it still. Although the owners might of booted all your ships out into space. You should still be in station but once you un-dock your can't dock again.

WHen there's an anchoring structure people are in just for the kb padding not for a fight, as far as I've seen it done. 
---
Also the obvious counter to drones, smartbombs, will most likely result in your fleet getting mopped away by concord
---
A couple weeks back a guy was able to petition a gm to move him out of the wormhole he logged off in long ago.
---
That happened to me a few times. I always fit enough tank on my viators to survive at least 2 tornado volleys, however, so no losses yet. I have seen people using up to four tornadoes to blap blockade runners, so nothing is guaranteed.
---
Judging from the rewards this is a 2008 post.
---
I ain't no petition coward. I've sat in that WH hangar since 2017, they've earned their kill.
---
First of all - was in like a fortizar or so? Since it took months for a small corp that is good enough to move in a wormhole I would expect a fortizar/tatara/sotiyo ?   
---
And if this is the case, the next question would have been - why, if you don't have the numbers to protect it?  
---
Anyways, those being out of the way - there's no way to reliably protect against incoming holes, it's just what it is. When we tried to anchor stuff and didn't have the numbers to protect it we just tried to timezone tank it. Anchor it around downtime on sunday - keep the hole buttoned up, roll everyting shut again on monday early morning and hope for the best.   
---
As to the psychological side - I haven't found any way around it. Eve being what it is - more of a hobby than just a game, you can't just split it cleanly from the real life, just like you would do with any hobby in which you sunk a lot of time.  You could have a hobby like idk, sailing, and be pissed off about scratching your boat one day. You wouldn't expect to just not feel it.   
---
Just harden up, think about how you could've done it better, whether it's worth it - get some more friends in, go for a couple of cheap roams to ease the hurt, give them some titles/decorations and, most importantly, anchor another one, but this time do it right :) 
---
Don't listen to all the people crying about you evicting people. Its wormhole space, everyone including major entities should expect to be evicted.  As long as you dont cry when it happens to you. 
---
*groups
---
Spoken like a true man!
---
The thing is though they have no way of knowing that your counter fleet doesn't have a cyno fitted that is going to get a tackle and drop capitals on them. Taking a fight, particularly with brawling or bubbles, is very risky because there's always a high chance of the locals being able to bring capital backup.
---
So even for a 'fair' defender who wants to get a good fight you should support nerfs to cynos so attackers feel they can engage you.
---
Eventually it becomes part of the lore of your corp.  
---
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.  
---
Even the biggest losses are only temporary as isk simply falls from the sky.
---
&gt;EvE-Scout Enclave
---
Hey that's illegal. 
---
I‚Äôm in a position in eve to see a lot of small to large losses happen yearly.. no matter how rich we think we are or what the consequences to a fight look like .. everyone in eve at some point feels that gut punch... the hard kick and realization that you lost one of your precious toys ..
---
I see it when a new rorq pilot isn‚Äôt able to cyno out, excav gets whelped by npc or a titan gets dunked .. the pilots always go quiet soon after the explosions.. at times members begin to tear into them at that point .. less about actual anger that it disrupted their day or anything but more because I guess they are frustrated that the fight could have been avoided or better done on better terms..
---
Then.. I find myself in a fleet doing the very thing to someone else... sitting off grid as rockets are pounding away at a big shiny..
---
It‚Äôs eve .. that‚Äôs the cost you pay when you undock... and over time you develop a tolerance for it.. for me I‚Äôve dropped big expensive ships into really stupid fights and never even blinked at the thought... but in a rorq or two and a fleet swarms in ... fuck.. I think I‚Äôm addicted to that rush .. the only game that gives me that shakes hand feeling is Eve and Rust (when you get online raided)..
---
Eve, a game of alts =)
---
&gt; Cause having 100-300 battle ships that can jump into a system, anchor up and tank like a regular battle ship, then jump out if in trouble is pretty stinking OP
---
You mean like capital ships with an exit cyno?
---
If you are not instantly podded, but have no way out : https://evescoutrescue.com/home/
---
Thx for this update bud &lt;3 keep up the good work !
---
this is the only correct answer. The nullseccers in here giving him options to fly cheap throwaway ships don't account for the fact that death is almost always podding, and if you're podded out of your home hole you're back in KSpace.
---
ITT: goons are building so many supers in delve that for lack of market they started selling them underhand to their enemies too :)) 
---
Last time he structure bashed in syndicate he fed 50 dudes to 5 duders.
---
This reply still has done nothing to explain the bit about warping to the Sun and ejecting and getting back into your ship.
---
It's both sensor strength and signature radius, by the way. 
---
Eh, it's lame but they had to draw a line somewhere.
---
I think dropping caps on everything is repetitive predictable gameplay that people have perfected.  
---
The reason EVE will never be an Esports game:  
---
There's no zero level people start from. The Esports EVE would be a system with 2 citadels, equal amount of players with equal skills and you have to do kill npcs and do mining to get the ships to destroy the enemy citadel
---
PL./NC./Horde are all right up your their for your needs.
---
The could give it the old ecm behavior back as a special trait i would guess.   
---
Other than that looks pretty shite with the new changes. Before it was almost a constant presence in a blops gank group. 
---
Lol alliance can't win fights, pays eve to do it for them. 
---
holly shit ! Nice to read that :D It s crazy sometimes the traitors.
---
What is doing the black hand?!
---
&gt; Wheeler was the CHAOS supercap FC in the 2016 CHAOS Super Whelp to INIT where INIT got one up on us.
---
I can faintly hear wheeler's depressed screaming all the way up here in Kansas for people still bringing this up.
---
Haha, alright then. Good luck storming the castle!
---
*and allows it sub-warp movement...  Fit High angles and go full Berserker Mode on subs during massive fights 
---
I completely uninstalled the app and reinstalled, it is now working correctly
---
Ouch.
---
NC. helping Imperium root out traitors. Upvoting a NC. post. Two things I never thought would happen!
---
Afraid to say that hole control by HK and friends could have been better whilst Holesale have gotten better at getting their guys into the WH. All bodes well for a decent fight provided that Holesale man up and put their cock on the block!
---
I'm assuming from your fits on killboards that you are low skill character is this correct ? If this is so, part of your problem is just that. Not necessarily the fits or execution but the skills. Well, fits related to the low skills. Simply put, you have a lot less DPS then you should, maybe as much as 60% less, and possibly likewise with tank but to a little bit lesser degree. I'd just give it a bit of time until you can comfortably fit T2 weapons and ammo and tank mods. Things will drastically change when that happens.
---
Not gonna lie, shit like this made me not want to bring my alliance to wormholes in the first place. I finally bit the bullet and did, and I'm glad I did, but I really hate to see entities like yours basically killing the desire for a group to survive/grow because you wanted some loot and to glamor post on Reddit about it. I'm honestly still getting my bearings as far as the political scene of WH's but this looks like a total dick move to me. Instead of potentially fighting you and having fun, I'd now be more inclined to just roll any hole that came in contact with you so you wouldn't get eviction-happy over some pseudo-offense that doesn't make any sense.
---
Ok, there is a myth about doing that to get your drones debugged so that they dont get aggro more they should be. Never believed in it, never done it before. This time tried it sweating, leaving a valuable asset alone for a bit. And i would like to say that it worked based on my remaining couple of hours of fighter lossless ratting experience.
---
I was just waiting for the bullshit not "constructive" claim. They always ignore the constructive stuff, so they deserve nothing.
---
And I explained several times that Im talking about "FW space". This is not the same as a plex.
---
I mean that was just a blanket excuse you kick you cause you're actually catastrophically autistic

I am. Very much so.

  They *always* ignore constructive stuff? CSM doesn't matter? 
---
Yeah i still dont know why imperium are taking guys like that. If one day it will be hard for us, so many people will flip like they join.
---
Such a shame, looks like you've asked the bigger boys to evict you now. 
---
Why is that ? I have given some of these out to PvE newbies and they work fine all the way up to L3 missions and the SUnesis has completed SOE epic arcs multiple times, so these are well proven. At L3s there are only 2-3 missions that these can't handle, once you know which ones and how to decline etc. you can just skip these until you get into a better ship. Next best newbie ship down the line for missile / shields are Caracal and Gnosis.
---
The only thing on Sunesis is that it uses drones too, so what ends up happening is that new players can't have 5 drones out until some time passes, but even with 3 or 4 is good enough for L2s and SOE arc.
---
EVERYONE JUMP SIEGE AND ACTIVATE JIHAD!... Fuck the target jumped out cause we lost tackle. 
---
At 1 point in time, the Widow was briefly my favorite ship in the game. Then most black ops died out, then on top of that it got nerfed to hell. Now it just sucks major ass and I'm strongly debating with myself if I should just extract all the BLOPS and marauder skill points, that's how bad it is, but I just can't seem to bring myself to do it.
---
Given how the dank leak thread has played out, can you confirm that a TNT extirpation is in the works?
---
Hyde is good people.
---
Given the fact that fitted carrier, albeit not very well fitted but still fully and well functional, cost 1.3 Bil, which is way less then just a BLOPS hull, and this is not counting insurance or fit on the BLOPS, this would be perfectly justified.
---
It's a good mantra, but things tend to accumulate.
---
&gt; they are literally Assassin-style glass cannons that can jump in, kill and then jump out
---
No. They aren't. They are supposed to be. That is their main problem.
---
no
---
&gt;What is doing the black hand?!
---
Busy taking credit other people's work.
---
Who am i kidding they'll probably take credit for these screenshots too.
---
Theres a giant difference here in the view though.
---
You normally have to be absolutely stupid, afk, or a bot that short circuited to get hunted at all. Its the fact that the games gotten way more safer for making isk now.
---
Either you can hunt people who make the dumbest mistakes in existance, which that proportion is so low now *because* the games safer, or nothing gets hunted at all. 
---
Theres litteraly no gameplay into catching anyone unless they slip up, which kind of takes the risk out greatly.
---
&gt;lmao dawg just take the fight on top of the citadel against the carriers lmao dude just adapt and fight. Stop crying about content if you dont want to fight
---
If you actually believe this then you need to call the spod addiction hotline 
---
https://discord.gg/e3dpbM
---
It can be done on NPC station because some JF player are too stupid enough to use a friendly citadel.
---
They are not thethered when they hit warp. You just cyno in at this time, with a nyx full dps and can almost alpha them. the pilot has low time to act and if he is not acting fast he died with a big big loss.
---
&gt;that's not a jump gate problem
---
&gt;getting blobbed constantly
---
Gates dont contribute to suddenly having an overwhelming force coming up your anus? 
---
That's not a very nice way to talk about Sister Bliss...
---
My god, You're still around! Love your vids!
---
Mr Chunky, Flightleader , Velsharoon ,Intigo , Casper 24 just to name a few. That's just guaranteed death for me.
---
another reason why i dont like the replacement of POS
---
&gt;And you, bored pvpers don't want to lose your ships
---
Not everyone puts value on digital pixels like yourself. Some people just like to shoot stuff and be dammed the price 
---
Current "JB" are not the issue. 
---
'Golden' age of roaming was when pos based JB where working in exactly same way.     
---
People where camping JB then and it is easier now - as unless citadel is not manned it will not shoot.        
---
You should try to see how hard JB camping was on a "large dick or jamm star"       
---
People simply organize more now ... or are busy mining (main issue with eve now). 
---
Only if
---
- You can fit a covops cloak. Uncloaked, an astero gives you little over a T1 exploration frigate and is a lot shinier for hunters
---
- You can afford to burn the 50m if/when you get caught
---
- You can't fly covops, or you want to have combat capabilities while exploring. With covops IV it's generally better (and cheaper) to fly a covops for pure exploration
---
I mean, there is a link on the sidebar, does that not work now?
---
It's the sin for me, full rack of neuts, Some DDA's and shield tank. Gotta splash the cash if you want to do it good. If you really have some spare ISK invest in an officer cap booster as it's really strong.
---
what side bar
---
Skills serve two purposes- ability to use a ship/module/etc, and your proficiency at using it. When you advance ship classes (like frigates to destroyers) you‚Äôll need to train the destroyer skill. To learn the initial one you‚Äôll have to buy the book on the market. You can check what ships or modules require what skills by right clicking on it, selecting show info, and then selecting the requirements tab. Green means you got it red means you don‚Äôt. 
---
Important note- don‚Äôt just take level 1 of skills because it trains the fastest. There are serious improvements that will save your life and/or allow you to be much more powerful the higher your skills are. Power grid management for instance- you won‚Äôt be able to fit your ship the same with it at level 1 as you can at level 4 or 5 because you don‚Äôt get the same reduction to power consumption from your modules. Certain skills decrease lock on time, increase missile range, etc. 
---
Also, skills train real time, not just logged in time.  It‚Äôs essential you make a que of skills so that when one finishes the next one starts right away, even if you‚Äôre logged off. You can also add further levels of each one in the que.  so you could buy say, the cloaking book. Then add levels 1, 2, and 3 to the que so it‚Äôll just go one to the next. Experienced players have ques literally months long and well thought out.
---
Level most skills to 3, 4 is better, 5 is serious time but essential for the best ships and modules. Also core skills that help you across the board not matter what ship you‚Äôre in- power grid, cpu, spaceship command, etc- are good ones to get to 5. Maybe not right away but when you get a lull add them. And adding a skill in front of the currently training one doesn‚Äôt hurt you at all. If you really want level 1 of something right now, and a level 5 is training, fuck it add it. The time remaining on the level 5 will just pause. 
---
As for exploration- you can make oodles of money once you get it down. Basically you fit a ship with probes, and analyzers (there‚Äôs relic and data sites). You use the probes to find the sites and the analyzers to solve a small puzzle then you loot the can. You can make 30,000isk in a can or 100 million, luck of the draw. But once you get comfortable scanning it‚Äôs actually pretty fun. Get it down in high sec and then get a ship that can move while cloaked, then you‚Äôre only really vulnerable while actually opening the cans (or on gates in null but wormholes are more fun for exploration anyway)
---
But Eve is all what you wanna do. There‚Äôs people who do nothing but mine, people who just run missions in high sec, people who only gank on gates, massive corps that constantly fight with each other over sov in null sec. 
---
If you want a fun read- google ‚Äúbattle of B-R5RB.‚Äù
---
Sidenote: sorry for so much information haha. It‚Äôs overwhelming at first but the more people you talk to the more things will click. Once you get a handle on the fundamentals of how shit works and how to progress, then it‚Äôs a lot more fun and you‚Äôll pick up the finer points as you play. Oh yea, don‚Äôt be afraid or sad to lose your ship, everyone loses ships. Just don‚Äôt be an idiot and undock with PLEX in your hold haha. 
---
jesus christ :)
---
whos that
---
I've got to admit. You guy's are getting better this last year. We have been caught with our pants down a few times. 
---
What even... you do realize that jump fatigue was introduced to prevent a single group from projecting across the entire map within minutes, and that before fatigue it was only a matter of minutes before PL showed up to your fight in a 200 man slowcat blob if they deemed it worth while? What do you think would prevent a single entity from crystalizing out again and stiffling pvp across the entierty of LS and NS?
---
&gt;they just wanted to dunk easy kills
---
Let's think about how you explained the fleet differences. If they fought you then I'm assuming it would've been a steam roll and then "they aren't looking for gudfites" 
---
But since they didnt fight they're just looking for easy kills. 
---
ü§î
---
Turns out when it isnt PIRAT sitting outside of Jita 4-4 it can generate some content  :p
---
Eve Uni does not officially own caps let alone drop them on 'any' visitors to PC9. The Null sec campus is quite happy to bring a fair fight , when one presents itself.
---
"krabs" organized then self.      
---
In the old days gang moving to a region made every one within 20j to dock up - and if someone was caught in 99% cases no one was coming to save him.      
---
Currently - the "pray" noticed that it is better just to form and overblob every gang moving in so they find other places to go next time, also that if they come to rescue someone - next time someone will come and rescue them.          
---
You need to also understand that before all gangs had offgrid links - that gave them huge advantage over people without those links.    
---
Now lets be honest - if you need links - you just inject them - also **There is no on grid good link ships** capable to maintain speed or tank of the rest of the fleet while providing proper boosts.        
---
TBH you need like 4-5 boosting ships to replicate single old offgrid link ship.    
---
Even more - offgrid links allowed you to move freely around the grid and in system and now people need to be near the link ship to get the boosts.       
---
&gt;What? Why? The Jump Bridges had to be on grid with a POS
---
Which ones are more powerful? A POS or a fort? 
---
YOU MONSTER!!!!!!
---
When did NC deploy and what was their purpose, content or objectives?
---
Just a fictional ancient crazy bloke, smothing like Gandalf.
---
Active jobs include jobs that are completed but not yet delivered. Do you have something outstanding from all those years ago?
---
Factory slots aren‚Äôt a thing any longer. It was kind of replaced with this system index cost instead. Some NPC stations will have different activities available, some will have all manufacturing and science activities available and others maybe just 1. In Jita 4-4 yes you can manufacture there as there is manufacturing available in that station. The downside of producing there is that the structure will give no bonuses and you‚Äôll pay a much inflated install cost because of the system index in Jita for manufacturing.
---
Now a days there are engineering complexes that will give extra bonuses to manufacturing and science jobs just for being designed for that plus extra bonuses if they are rigged for what you are doing in them. NPC stations have 0 bonuses for anything so you‚Äôre already at a disadvantage there. 
---
System index is basically a penalty for too many people doing industry in 1 system. System index is calculated per activity (manufacturing, invention, research, etc) and that‚Äôs going to affect how much of an install cost you‚Äôll pay for your job. For most manufacturing you want to try and stay around 2% and below. 
---
Basically CCP removed the hard cap of factory slots and replaced it with a penalty for too much industry in one system.
---
gandalf lmao
---
saw someone recently posted about 4 races of triglavian loot? or somethin like that and they were paying 1bn for it but now i cant find it. pretty sure i just got this today
---
Good people is a subjective term, traitors can be good people. Especially to other traitors.
---
Honestly, this shit makes you feel alive. I cant wait to lose my Sin to a counterdrop. I am gonna be sad, but I'll laugh my ass off afterwards just like I did when a supercapital was dropped on me while flying a Gila after killing one VNI.  
---
Dont be sad, be happy that this game can make you feel this way.  
---
Fly dangerous o7
---
That's basically already how it works /s
---
/thread
---
That's my point. As it is, no one wants a good fight. The roamers almost never take a fair fight even if it presents itself. They either think it's bait or want to avoid it because they came to do to afk krabs what the caps want to do to them. Everyone just wants easy kills. 
---
Buffer armor-tanked neuting Sin is pretty sweet. Gives you more utility-mid slots and you can fit MJD and MWD + tackle. Fly it with slaves.
---
Agree, this is\^\^\^.
---
"Come for our AMA where the PR will decide wether or not your question is worthy of our time"
---
&gt;Glad that's out of the way. Dual tanks is really quite common for 1v1 set ups. 
---
its too bad you didn't notice he's triple tanking...
---
&gt; If your worried about tanking, your doing it very wrong. Blops are not Brawley ships, they are gank and gtfo ships
---
OP was asking about solo dropping and for that you need some tank unless you just drop on miners. 
---
Their assault frig gang outnumbered our assault frig gang. If they were hoping for an actual fight, that was probably the best chance they'll ever see. Instead, they ran off, because they just came in looking for easy stuff to quick blob. We definitely could have lost the fight. It was close enough that both sides would've lost stuff.
---
75 mill in data analyzers? Do you see that 15K spike in history tab? Yeah that was my smartass buying a total of 20.000 data analyzers because'' BUmPinG The PriCe Up tO 200K WilL mAkE Me AloT Of IsK"

WH Life is hard you get resilient or you leave.  When we had an eviction attempt against us we were ill prepared ill organised, but lucky, in that we had batphone that could get in.   Even though we didn't loose the wh we took it as a wake up call to get our act together.
---
Since then we have grown, prepared and seen the eviction attempt on us as the trigger that caused all the improvements.  And I'm sure Heaven Angels will as well, they seem like some proper WH'ers unlike the SEADC group. Who shotgun spam newplayer systems to recruit newbrows provide little in the way of direction etc etc.. In my eyes they're little better than the NPC started corp except all the tax goes SEADC instead of an isk sink.
---
Heavens Anglels fly safe and break away from SC if I were you. 
---
Have they fixed the problem where killing NPC caps in moon belts wouldn't award bounties?
---
Command destroyers are commonly used in roaming gangs tho, and in my book they definitely are good link ships. Of course, off grid links were easier, but I don't think this is a huge problem right now. 
---
Hence why the new capital changes are good.
---
I expect my karma to start acting like my structure HP any second now...
---
but do they spawn in lowsec?
---
i know u can DD them 
---
They hired a Community Manager?
---
I made an account/character on 11/15/2010, did well. a bunch of nothing on it.

Should I re-use that account and character if I want to tryout eve again? 
---
What's a good starting reading point outside of the discord here to go into?(I'm about to join the discord in just a few moments)
---
Hopefully "dropping caps on everything" should be less viable come the 9th. Fingers crossed.
---
I should order a vodka bottle for everyone in the corp. 
---
Correct. We have seen many cases of players pointing out clearly legitimate issues before changes are deployed to tranq, yet they are ignored. Months/years later of much player suffering, CCP have been forced to admit those things were indeed problems.
---
CSM is nearly completely useless. It exists to appease the crowd of retards by letting them vote for something that makes no difference. CCP could just ask the community, but will not do so because they know they have built up a massive debt of "fuck you"-level criticism as a result of ignoring all the constructive feedback over the years.
---
The experience gained and knowledge gathered while doin it stays. And might prove valuable later.
---
People still use TS3?
---
In all fairness, though, saying "if you don't like it then leave it" isn't really on. People who are disgruntled can at least try to make change they see as positive.
---
I'm addicted to this site! Is it currently down??? I needs it precious! :D

what is wrong with it

Yeah I remember the river of tears from HK, it was embarrassing.  Stiff upper lip and all that.

Jesus! Great way to go about it! I guess I'll laugh after a while at the hit we took and our bad luck.

.. that would have worked. We had none. Shame on us.

No matter which BLOPS you pick, esp. when you drop solo, use this to check out your victim before you jump:

have you met my good friend legacy code?

probably an item for an event to come or long pass.

Does not matter bro. If You like this char name and looks + have some skills already made just go for it.  Start by doing investigation thingy from Agency just to remind game basics :) cheers!

Hah I'm taking notes on this one.

&gt;Does not matter bro. If You like this char name and looks + have some  skills already made just go for it.  Start by doing investigation thingy  from Agency just to remind game basics :) cheers!

Well. There was a truce at the end of it. But look where it is again. In the dustbin where it should have gone in the first place.
---
:)
---
The wallet should...Planetary...well...It needs more efforts than I was willing to give it. I'll most likely focus on that for the next iteration.
---
it's sad
---
in our space, me and my colleagues are always fighting in subs, we never drop caps on people...
---
but gosh, most of the ally is like "do you have a cyno?" every fucking time
---
It's like cancer, 99% people can only drop big shit cos they can't fucking pvp at all.
---
thanks ccp for injectors where people won't learn anything but jumps directly to caps.
---
Perhaps check it out on your login screen first, there you can see if you are still in the corp or not. If not and they are still active, you can try to explain your situation, perhaps they are willing to take you back. 
---
Practically, basically nothing. 
---
Also, advertising yourself as basically a krab is either a great shitpost or a terrible sell. 
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not being toxic to you?
---
What about it is bugged, not familiar with it.
---
Hey, honesty is the best policy.

Besides, nothing gets blown up without being built first.

idk who any of you are but this sounds like a guy in TNT trying to do something about the ~dead alliance dead game~ effect so I guess I'm for it. 
---
p.s. wtb bulk caps in NPC fountain, dreads &gt; else, pm me here or on discord
---
Softer tp in their restrooms
---
&gt;It‚Äôs essential you make a que of skills so that when one finishes the next one starts right away,
---
thing is it only allow me train 1 skill at time how do you make several go at same time
---
whats nullsec
---
also can you do any mission out of the blue or you have to go to the agency and select a special exploration mission
---
also yeah the information is indeed overwheleming. your not the first one who just pumped me hard with information, litraly everyone in the comment section wrote the same thing like an essay. im not used to this type of games . as girl i used to find candycrush hard  lmao

Why did my brain read ‚Äúnail-edit‚Äù first and was like: ???

What is this highsec you speak of
---
Live off the land like a true nomad. Or do what a guy did some time back and do guerrilla war against the locals until they scan you a way out themelves just to be rid of you :)
---
They are drops from a new site in Abyssal space that can be rarely encountered when running T5 filaments in cruisers or frigates. They are a loot box (yay...) and contain Data Streams and new Semiosis Conduction Consoles.

 Just for information let me link a post of mine [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b3ury6/t5_abyssals_gone_wild_new_site_discovered/).

Fredrick Vonhole - a.k.a. the guy hunting solo blops. Never got to see him yet, I just know the moment I do, I am about to lose a blops.

They're back in pure blind! Omg we were there together years ago, had amazing fun.

So it's a C4 relic site. You warp in. Clear first wave. Then hack the cans. The trigger for the second wave is supposed to happen when you fail a hack. But it never happens no matter how many times you fail so you only end up with 1 wave out of 3.
---
Judging from Google it's been this way for years... 
---
no. and it wont since the last whale got milked and the servers go dark. eve is over.

i thought eve glitched and i got a double room. fakkin el. i spawned 125km from those leshaks and almost died haha well thank you very much for explaining it.

OOC did you open it or keep it in the box? not sure wat to do with it
---
Do you have any bug report numbers on hand from yourself?

Man, that's levels of bittervet even I never hit.

If it was that easy, they wouldn't have to use words to describe it like "smuggle" and engage in even these small levels of subterfuge.

found that in there tysm man. this explains everything haha
---
It's function was anti-tackle in a Blops drop, or to jam out carrier/super fighters. This isn't possible now that you can target anyone jamming you, and it's tanky enough to cope with a super.
---
It needs a trait that removes that liability to ECM, just for that hull. It already wasn't amazing, with anaemic dps, no utility beyond ECM, and to get a reasonable number of jams compromises shield or results in a sub-par armor tank. It had a niche, and now it has nothing, it brings nothing to the table that other Blops don't already do objectively better.

Is a good shout man but i am kinda a minmatar fanboy unfortunately.

HAW Titan DPS got (is being?) nerfed by around 50% (Dread DPS stays the same tohugh!), usage of the NSA is getting riskier (by a little), but overall Captials remain the solution to about every problem (CCP wants this to change soon^(TM), but we all know what that means :) ).

A side bar is generally a bar to the side of a page

We also played rust! And sucked in rust as much as in EVE. I think we starting to take pride in how much we suck at stuff, but still have the funs.

But when I got the site my first time I thought it was a bug, too, because visuals were lacking and the construction site in the middle looked odd.
---
I opened the boxes I got. All players who had consoles in their possession last week on Friday got a mail from the Triglavian Collective with a video link inside.
---
With more events upcoming it‚Äôs likely that triglavians send more one-way messages to us.
---
I've given my banking alt a large ammount of isk during a little sort out, if you could double it, I'd be very happy.

well theres no inv on my side bar

Will grab the number tomorrow sorry

click on Discord server

Well you tried atleast.

theres no discord server dammit

why would you? according to your OP you barely played the game.

These are hull rigs tho.

I don't know, ask an elite Redditor like /u/Laz-Long

Are you new here? Do you expect CCP to fix basic shit that has been broken since it was introduced? Lol the only way old pve ever changed was for the worst. Not convinced? You should try doing Cosmos missions.

Hello, I'm the one who led what defense efforts I could. First serious time commanding a fleet and while I know I made several mistakes I believe we put up a decent fight with what we had. [https://i.imgur.com/LOEeTGG.png](https://i.imgur.com/LOEeTGG.png)
---
Since we're getting some reddit attention I thought I'd create an account and respond with my PoV and tell a story.
---
&gt; WHSOC was interested in outing SEADC due to mass recruiting, imposing a tax, and doing next to nothing to assist many newbros. Being in w-space as well, they had decided an eviction attempt was worthwhile. We decided to help them. We ref 2x Athanors and their Fortizar that night. 
---
The way SEADC works is as a "throw spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks" corp to get newbros into the game and see what they like, wormholes, nullsec, highsec mining, lowsec cruiser/frigate roams, what have you. It's the largest corp in our meta alliance, "Silent Coalition", and I'm sure everybody's seen the website and shit. We have about 250 people active on Discord, and about 100 people on average in an in-game channel. This meta coalition is who first contacted me in the game when I started and is who I've stayed with through SMA and ChaosTheory, making many friends over the years. 
---
Recently we had a spat of drama with a guy named Stoseph Stuart who ran several moon mining structures in HS. We were temporarily friends with them, and while I'm not privy to the conversation he had with Ikarus Cesaille, we *were* blues for about a month. For whatever reason Stoseph parted ways abruptly, locking newbro assets out for a while. I have some speculations as to why he cut off communication, but without hearing from him we have no clue. 
---
In EVE fashion we became friends with another group who started systematically blowing up all of Stoseph's structures leading him to utter those 5 wonderful words:

As for Heaven's Angels, we're not quitting J-Space, we're not giving up, and we're going to learn from our mistakes and do better. 
---
Maybe wormholers stole it. I heard they are the root of all evil in this game.
---
yeah like 10 years ago
---
implying anyone from TNT can do anything on their own lol. You're literally 6. tier renters
---
i just barely managed to tank the entire room lol. finished it all and was panicking about only 10mins left so i just grabbed the loot and ran... fuckin a. ty fam imma open this one then i guess
---
Ok so from what I read in this post, HydeX has not heavily insulted, IRL threatened, hacked or even discriminated anyone. He has no blue fucked a rorq cloud, nor a ratting supe/titan. He hasn't reset any standings nor transferred any structures to the enemy.
---
Smuggling supers out of Delve warrants getting called traitorous piece of shit and be threatened to get hanged IRL and the post is allowed to stay too. Are all of you the goon guy that looks more like a bowling ball that came to EVEsterdam in a bee costume and a helmet? 
---
You can only train one skill at a time. The que is just an order or stack of skills that will train one after another. Say you really want an exhumer (a class of mining ship), you could look at the requirements and que every skill needed to fly one. It might take 3 weeks to train them all but they will train one after another. Making a good que is nice because say you can‚Äôt play one day, or over a weekend, with a que you aren‚Äôt ‚Äúlosing‚Äù time advancing in game in terms of what your character can fly/use. 
---
Nullsec refers to areas of space with a security status 0.0 and below. Basically it‚Äôs the Wild West. In high sec, if someone shoots you, concord (npc police) comes after them. They might kill you but they get timers and lose security status. Nullsec on the other hand is a free for all. Shoot whoever you want, concord ain‚Äôt coming. But null has better rewards than high sec in terms of isk, along with more powerful enemies. Null is where large Corp battles happen normally. 
---
Exploration isn‚Äôt necessarily missions, you just go out and do it. You need a certain ship fit for it but there‚Äôs no agent like security missions telling you where to go. You just hop around systems until you scan something down, go to the site, get the loot, onto the next one. 
---
It's like this. If this kind of of weekly moaning posts get jump gates nerfed so they too incur fatigue, we'll just resort to exclusively dropping supers instead of flying small toys to play with you.
---
I'm guessing that is not the outcome you're after.
---
They like to deploy to Gehi every once in a while. They create a bunch of timers and lose most of them until we send out a less experienced FC with a conservative fleet comp, at which point they batphone and stomp it. This goes on for about a week, then we sit on their face with supers and they go away. These deployments are so flaccid that we don't even tell our guys that NCdot has deployed in the first place.
---
Judging from the killmails linked Holesale have a nullsec static? It's basically impossible to prevent them from getting dudes in through that if they're even remotely competent. All it takes is a titan or a blops. 
---
oh btw im just messing with ya. i dont want to use you for resources or anything. join me ingame so we can have fun together maybe kill some ppl lol
---
For future reference the sun has nothing to do with it. You just need to exit and enter the ship and you can do that in the safety of a pos or keepstar. 
---
We're so fucking bored we're giving people the tools to fight us with. 
---
Who are you and what did you do to /u/StainGuy? 
---
I actually understood and agree with what you said for once. :)
---
hmm the exploration thing seems diffcult to understand  anyways ill stick to to agent missions 
---
and i think i got it zones with 0.0 secuirty and below are dangrous and includes valuable resources but contain high tier spaceships which will destroy me easily. and safer zones has police and etc 
---
Buffer sin would legit die to the average krab rattle.
---
Simple explanation: toxic cunt
---
There is no "official" discord, just the r/eve one.
---
It's made by players, for players.
---
CCP has no authority on eather the subreddit or the discord. 
---
Why should I feed you my krabbing ship. The krabs got good. Be better.
---
If my supers don‚Äôt die while in glorious supercap brawl then I will be sad the next few days. 
---
You have lots of frogs near you?
---
If you are pvping in lowsec I'm guessing you are looking for fights in FW plexes... if that's the case, your mwd is unnecesary, use an AB.
---
I would also drop the SAAR in favour of a Gyro, the MASB works great as buffer for hull tanks, but after that you should prioritize damage or range control (keep the SAAR and drop the MASB for a web).
---
Use it to do DED in drone lands 
---
Hi fren
---
TL,DR you bit off more than you can chew, had to ring the batphone like little pussies, and then evicted new W-Space people trying to actively defend their stations / actually educating and pulling people into the game. Then you make a post about it to brag.   
---
And then you try to reason it with SEADC which is absolute bullshit to start with. They have a 1% tax rate (BIG TAX INTRODUCTION) and the entire purpose of the group is to just give people an idea of what options they have by showing them different parts of space.  
---
But I suppose it is better to discourage hundreds of new players from discovering new space and then complain about low activity rates. 
---
And a blue pill 
---
I regret searching for his posts.
---
NSH were never russians afaik
---
Whew...just when I thought all salt mines were all mined out.
---
Do you have examples of this from past?
---
I lost a jump freighter and my PVE pod last month because I wasn‚Äôt paying attention. About 10bill gone.
---
That‚Äôs the biggest loss I‚Äôve had and it was actually the easiest to get over. It was even easier than getting over losing my first pod of +4 implants when I first started playing.
---
What I eventually realized was this is just a game and those isk numbers are just pixels on a computer screen. Dwelling on it is just going to screw you up over something that ultimately doesn‚Äôt matter IRL. 
---
The fact you have a small Corp of friends that can work together to build something is actually more important imo. You now have a ‚Äúyou remember that one time‚Äù story that you can/should laugh about. In fact thats something I don‚Äôt have currently and if I did, it‚Äôd mean a whole lot more to me than losing a couple billion isk. 
---
wts titans 35b ea cash in advance
---
Look at what they do and not at what they say.
---
There is HUGGGGGGGE difference between old 5 link tengu and this command destroyers you have.     
---
First of all this one tengu could provide links to all people in system and in fleet. Wherever they were.
---
It provided 5 strong links instead of 1-2 like  a command destroyer.      
---
Main cause of escalations? They literally did the exact same thing as HVEN, live in a hole, learn the ways, defend their stations, and try to make some isk/ get content. If that is a main cause of escalation/eviction, its maybe time for a reality check.
---
they do spawn but instead of immediately it takes 10-30 minutes to do so. Just run the first wave, hack a few cans, and do other sites, then come back to them and they'll be fine.   
---
I mean of course CCP has to fix them but this is the workaround we found.  
---
So what is the utility or the benefits of the t2 ?
---
You and your friends bit off more than you could chew, now you are paying for it. What you are experiencing is actually the best thing about EVE and why it's still here; losses REALLY matter.
---
You get over it by keeping it all in context. None of this is real, all of your 'effort' was really just you sitting in front of a computer playing a computer game, and every single 'asset' you 'own' in the game is already lost/ dead the moment you by/build it so don't get attached to anything.
---
The quote the movie "Heat":   *"Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in* ***30 seconds*** *flat if you feel the* ***heat*** *around the corner."* 
---
The lesson is the same as always: Don't fly (OR DEPLOY) anything you can't afford to lose.
---
Thanks for letting me enjoy that post.
---
So posting censored shit that's going to get people in trouble is your way to get back at a government thats not yours?
---
Grow the fuck up

Is this the same Hyde that deleted all his youtube videos?

Goon communism at its finest
---
Here in New Orleans, Popeyes where it originated it's not the best fried chicken. It's the chicken in the gas stations. 
---
As teh guys said but also if you want to bootstrap (for some reason) your combat log text will also show you the damage type you take and for NPCs that's also the damage you should deal. 
---
Oh no, the leaks happened because HydeX literally made the worst post imaginable on reddit, while exposing that he was smuggling said titans (although he quickly said that was just an attempt by NSH to "frame" him).
---
If he just kept his mouth shut, none of this would have come to light.
---
Ah its the double web no scram asshat thats scared of fair fights. Keep warping out once someone tries to match you (those are not in the video, huh? I wonder why)

How about you actually try to achieve something in your fights once? Shits pretty sad. And making a vid about it even sadder.

&gt;~~bored~~ stupid

Among other problems, CCP changed ECM mechanics that you can now lock the single ship that had landed a successful jam on you. If you are fighting a fleet with a dedicated ECM wing that might not be a big deal, but this rendered the Widow completely useless because it doesn't matter how big your ecm bonuses and green or purple your jams are if you can be still locked by what you are jamming anyway.
---
Finally trained shitposting to V. Feels good man.
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted. It's in inconvenient truth that more people are spending more doing alternative things than roaming.
---
Organized, clinical PVP is far too common, and tbh I think most of it comes down to the maturing playerbase having less time to play.
---
The only reason roaming is dying is because no one is roaming.
---
That would piss me off way more than a loss worth 10x as much 
---
Locals down
---
Gotta pump up those login numbers I guess
---
It's not like anyone is going to invade us. 
---
I lost some widows in my hangars. No idea what they are.
---
&gt;eve
---
&gt;traitorous piece of shit
---
So, your average player?
---
Roaming is also dying as there is no small level targets except for 2-3 people except for VNI.        
---
But tbh - you cannot make people to stop forming and defend some space - when this proved best way to do it. 
---
Good job. Evict some more WHers. They all deserve it. 
---
Yep
---
My idea was quite simple for this.      
---
Make all FW space perma cyno jammed, maybe even with supers and titans forbidden in taking the gates to this area.          
---
&lt;3
---
&gt;I submitted a bug report as probably 100s of people before me have done
---
Have you tried posting a reddit thread? You do know CCP doesn't care about shit until it hits reddit, right?
---
Sexy!
---
Why invade when you can farm
---
JF should be disallowed from taking the higsec gate like capitals. 
---
I'm sure /u/wibla will have loads of fun shooting people.
---
Yes truly the loss of ratting supers and rorqs is crippling us as evidenced by our 0lu going income on the MER. 
---
Do you want to buy a skill extractor? 
---
the last time i was in gehi deployed was pre WWB ... so dunno what exactly you mean. By this times goons still where in the north.
---
Yeah like I said. You're an idiot. 
---
Graphic designers! Need more skins! And more skins. Please restock store with more skins!
---
Well, Mebbe there is a few things more important (launcher, local chat...) okay yeah. So the game is broken as fuck, and sometimes can‚Äôt play. But there are skins in store for when your can actually play.
---
I'm not denying there is substantial difference, just pointing out you still can have good links in roaming gangs. 
---
What is the meaning of life?
---
300M/h is the maximum I did with a no pimp rattle, no pod, several T1 MTU but with magnetar effect and a nice succession of anoms.
---
My average was around 250 thanks to C3 Forgoten Relic and unsecure Data witch are beter ISK/ehp than regular anoms (and a little bit safer)
---
Pandemic Horde? WH corp?
---
It may behoove you to log in more than once every five years.
---
i guess you meant lowslots. but yeah, dual tank trashers are actually a thing. a super gimmicky niche thing but a thing non the less. 
---
I'm sure you're having a blast subbing to a game to look at a graph every month while somehow someway the people getting daily content and fun off of your stupidity are the losers in the situation  
---
Because of a graph

Yikes.

You didn't.

There was a dude in Delve who used to rap in local and give us Intel when we lived there the first time, always gave us Intel on bad dudes camping next door, seemed to live in NPC Delve and just chilled out, think he ran missions or something.

When we moved back this time he was no longer present. Either stopped playing or moved on.

I've been saying it for years, HydeX is a fucking nipple dick cunt waffle.

Going off of this patch (hoboleaks: https://www.hoboleaks.space/Singularity_1479200-1481059), hangars have been moved over to the SOF system, which is what all ships and most other objects in the game use visually. While this is obviously just a first step, there're a lot of new possibilities for station interiors if things keep moving this way - like what was shown at the Amsterdam keynote, and beyond, like changing the color scheme of the interiors to match the station exteriors, etc.
---
None, shit ass mods delete all the fun shitposts

Wow, the images in my mind.

Come to think of it, even the space around Tama is pretty dead compared to the old days(for solo pewpew anyway).

Gotta feel good to knowing you still can't use Faction titans.

I fly with SV, we aren't even in Delve 90% of the year. Literally rhe main people you're hitting are idiot pubbies who joined up to 'rat in safety' or whatever. My main point in all this though was - Where's the harm in selling sueprs to your enemies if your enemies are never going to use them against you? 
---
Aw man you got awoxed by someone who you trusted to allow into an alt corp, who you later fucked you over with 0 repercussions. That really sucks doesnt it

pirat has a pos in amarr close to the trade hub, maybe horde are bored someday and kill it, cva manage to kill it one time before and they was not happy

[Recurring Opportunities](https://updates.eveonline.com/date/2016-05-24/), new daily that was implemented in May 2016. Undock and kill a NPC for 10k SP.

[Removal of Recurring Opportunities](http://evenews24.com/2016/06/23/dev-post-recurring-opportunity-removal/), June 2016. While activity increased, there was little change in login behavior. 
---
The bottom line, in my opinion, is they're saying fuck all the BS requirements. Just come play our game and we'll reward you. Fly safe.
---
Yeah, 4chan is an SA spinoff. The people who made 4chan fled SA after it was discovered that they were horrid pedophiles. 
---
OMG !
---
Yeah that Hyde was chill, hydex is a scrublord
---
Wasnt roaming still active years ago when we had fatigueless JBs?
---
It's a fair trade, he chooses more control and losses the ability to hold the enemy pinned down. I'd take this every day over the guy who goes full implants and boosters.
---
I think your onto something here...
---
Yeah, I'm sure many intellectual conversations were had in Anime Death Tentacle Rape Whorehouse.
---
It would be nice to see a bit more station (and especially citadel) interior variety.
---
Playing r/Eve has always been more fun than playing EvE.
---
Gee, I wonder why people think that eve players are assholes 
---
Not sure why you're downvoted, it isn't a bad thing to ping CCP employees about questions in reference to the game if they choose to be active on reddit.  Unless those downvotes are from them lol. 
---
Can you please kill this 20bil mach sitting on 4-4 they have. 
---
TY
---
If you fly with SV then you obviously know that your statement is false and supers are used against you fairly frequently, just not in Delve, so it's hurting you and where's the upside ? some pos just filling his pockets.
---
I know you don't fully believe your first comment and it's probably made in jest, but i don't understand why you would defend a dude that's filling his pockets by fucking you over.
---
Almost lol'd myself off the toilet with this comment, bravo sir o7
---
Thanks a lot to you and the other answsers. Definitely cleared up a lot for me and i had my first few hours yesterday and enjoyed what i have seen so far. As you seem knowledgeable i would like to ask some more questions if you dont mind that came up during my initial experience yesterday.
---
I am very interested in Artillery and from what i have seen artillery and other projectile weapons kinda share the same skills so i would be able to switch if i need to, but is artillery viable or very limiting in solo play? I am just afraid that i ll feel like a helpless fish if i get ganked and someone makes it close.
---
And that leads me to my second question about skills/skilltrees, is a character able to learn everything? Or do you need seperate characters for crafting, missles, projectiles, beams, support ect?
---
And i have seen a few "Noob" or starter communitys i am probably going to join, would you know if any of them have a good/bad rep if you got experience in that field?
---
stop taking drugs and stop posting
---
Keep doing God's work
---
stoopid noolseckers ruining pvp )))
---
Snap! Yep, this one is going in my cringe compilation 
---
clearly i mostly do log in once in a while inbetween some poe leagues... 
---
But i really cant remember when we where last deployed to Gehi. Iam part of NC. since 5 Years. Also i dont want to shittalk you maybe iam fully wrong... or there was an USTZ deployment which is not my timezone too...
---
shame he managed to get his pod away unlike that other guy, that would have been blingy for sure
---
&gt; i don't understand why you would defend a dude that's filling his pockets by fucking you over.
---
He has to choose between siding with a traitor, and siding with NC. It's a tough choice for the average goonie.
---
I think when (in your eve career) matters more than what. My first battleship was stolen from a corp POS. That BS was the product of weeks of chain ratting (ratting sucked before ihubs) and losing it burned me down for a few days.
---
These days, I could probably laugh about losing a Hel. I don't have the money to comfortably buy one but even if I did and had no cash reserves, losing it would still not be as big a deal as my first BS.
---
I endorse this post, but deny having anything to do with the creation of this killmail or posting to reddit. 
---
Any day PIRAT dies is a good day.
---
&gt;It took me a while of scrolling to find a name I could relate to but here it is. Mr Chunky is spooky. Damn him and his Coercers and Daredevils. Pretty sure I've only killed him once.
---
does this mean grimdark is coming back to eve?
---
maybe upwell structures get their own interiors instead of the caldari station one
---
-40F lol
---
This eviction and your eviction are not the same thing, don't pretend that they are. We picked you because you were an established corp that activity wise, had been dead for like 2 months.
---
Props on your recovery but Heaven Angels did not need an eviction to "trigger improvements". They were a new corp in WH space that undocked and fought people, something your previous iteration didn't even do when it was active.
---
t. Barghest Boi.
---
they first started to appear a week ago. these leshaks are guarding a triglavian capital ship, which is under construction

Yep agreed, in the end people will always evict for grudges, loot pinatas or just for something to do. If someone doesn't like that some group is evicting people then they should do something about it.

Why the tech 1 bastion modual?  all that training for the hull and the guns and you couldnt wait another 45 days to move it?  Not to mention you didnt even have fuel in the thing for the bastion modual.  that is unless you used it all.  then its just a stupid move not to bring as much as possible. I know this is P I R A T but come on.

I thought there was a tech 2.  I clearly no nothing about marauders. The bastion works just like the siege modual right?  That why is assumed it takes fuel and has a tech 2 modual

Another man and/ or woman of culture I see. Personally I collect corpses to dress as guests for dinner parties on my yacht. I engage in PvP purely as a way to invite new guests. It's my thing to do in Eve. And someone actually had the nerve to complain about lack of content to me today. Kids these days...

Pretty sure several members on the spectrum, Zero fucks given, PvP everyday. We are smart and dumb, shitters and unpredictable. Socially awkward, but an accepting community. Small and irrelevant with zero interest in Null Block Neck Beard Faggotry and who your shit posts offend. If you're loyal, we will treat you well.  
---
I'm not anyone's dad here and idc about offensive shit posts as none of us need to wear a helmet when we see something on the internet. Im not a big fan of SERIOUS racism or hate agendas (unless its about the Chinese or the French or Liberals lol). But seriously, everything here is gauged as a joke and if someone get their feelings hurt, they just move the fuck along. Words dont hurt, no matter how much people tell you that they do, people just have gotten weak over time - fuck the weak, lets kill them together.  
---
Well overall it should be bringing in a second group as well as having Heaven's Angels stay in WH space, we've offered to assist them in any way to get set up (hopefully without the involvement of SICO). There is more backstory to this but it's a lot to go into. Overall we were expecting a lot more resistance from SICO as a whole but they basically gave up before any fights had actually happened (which we learned a bit later). So it is bringing more people to WHs.
---
I'll fully admit that most of the reasoning behind this was more related to SICO than it was to HA, but when it's advertised (even in this thread) as *the* WH corporation of the coalition that seems to be not very separated. 
---
Thats all i ask :)
---
Never in Fortress Delve. We've lost Delve once and it was through Karttoons incompetence. 
---
&gt;I am very interested in Artillery
---
Your initial assessment is actually very accurate. To break it down very quickly - there are 3 types of turret weapons in the game - hybrid, energy (lasers) and projectile. Each of those can further be classified into a short-range, and a long range group. So hybrids have blasters and railguns, lasers have pulse and beam lasers, and projectile weapons are divided between autocannon and artillery. Usually, the long range variants deal less DPS and have a slower rate of fire. You are correct in that almost all skills that support artillery (found mostly under 'gunnery') also benefit autocannons just as much. In fact, most of them will benefit all turret weapons. 
---
Artillery as such finds several uses in PvP, and is by no means a bad choice. Usually you find it being used by fast, long-range ship that depend on staying outside the deadly grasp of hostile webifiers and warp scramblers in order to survive. Artillery also has (arguably) the longest range out of any turret weapon type. That said, you are correct in that allowing a hostile ship to get too close will often mean death for the artillery boat, as it won't be able to track them. We call this 'getting under your guns'. At that point you depend on allies or secondary weapon systems such as drones to get you out of trouble. On the other hand, if you can keep your distance, you will out-range most conventional enemy ships, so it's kind of a trade-off - just like almost everything else in the game. 
---
&gt; i assume is very fast delivered damage that pierces through a ships armor/shield and damages the ship before it gets time to regen/heal back up from context.
---
To be exact, a ship's 'alpha strike' is the amount of damage it deals in a single shot, as opposed to DPS which is continuous damage over time. So if your rate of fire was 'r', then your DPS would equal alpha/r. Alpha isn't really all that important in solo or small scale gameplay, as you will very rarely destroy other ships in a single strike, but it becomes critical to many fleet doctrines in nullsec, where hundreds of ships are involved in a battle. The idea is pretty simple - if you have enough alpha strike between all your ships to volley enemies off in single shots, then you have rendered their entire support wing (healers) useless. Additionally, high alpha weapons usually have very long range, which is just as important in nullsec combat. So alpha doctrines are really popular right now (look up muninns, eagles, feroxes). 
---
&gt;And that leads me to my second question about skills/skilltrees, is a character able to learn everything?
---
In theory, yes. For an omega pilot (a character on an account with a subscription), there is no upper limit in terms of how many skills they can train. Alpha pilots (free accounts) can only train 5M SP naturally, and they are limited in exactly what they can train during that time, although you won't really feel those limitations for a long time. The skill pool in EVE is very broad, but also very shallow. What this means is that it's easy to obtain perfect or near-perfect skills for some very specific role (for example, you could have the same skills for piloting interceptors or tactical destroyers as I have in just a few months), however it takes a very, very long time to master everything. Many people will indeed choose to train alternate characters that specialize in different things, but these are more utility pilots than combat pilots. For example, you might want a combat pilot, a mining alt, a hauling alt and a scanner alt, and all of those will have separate skills to train. However, training two different combat alts means you will have a lot of overlap, so you'll train a lot of the skills twice, which is inefficient. 
---
My recommendation is not to stress about it too much - try out a bunch of different ships types, try out arty and drones and some missiles and see what you like. Then explore the skill tree and just queue up anything you feel will help you. For combat, focus on ship command, gunnery/missiles/drones (pick one), engineering and navigation, and if you're ever stumped as to what to queue up next, you'll never go wrong with [the magic 14](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Magic_14). 
---
&gt;would you know if any of them have a good/bad rep if you got experience in that field?
---
This is always a tough question. I only have experience with Pandemic Horde, and I enjoyed my time with them immensley, but that was years ago and I can't really speak with confidence about them or any other group. So instead I'll just refer you to [this post breaking down some of the newbie corps](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/5edhnp/if_youre_an_alpha_clone_please_read_this_non_propa/), [this blog arguing against that specific post](https://blog.skyride.org/newbie-corps-suck/), and also /r/evejobs. And remember, even if you join one of those, you can always just change your mind and go elsewhere later and nobody will mind at all.

Nah. Bastion only has t1, used no fuel and gives bonus to resistance, rep amount and weapon range. Siege only increases rep amount but also dps.

I just try to remeber that this is a game and shit has to be blown up somehow. Why else build shit other than to blow it up. People that sit in keepstars/fortizars with toys only to spin them around don't have the right mentality. At the end of the day, we play this game to enjoy it, what better way to enjoy it than to fight to the teeth and blow up in glory every once in a while.

Well, I think the nature of this post didn't have the background motivations since most of them came from us not NJED. But overall this will be bringing another group into WH's and Heaven's Angels will be staying in WH space (hopefully without the ties to SICO), both being assisted by us to get established and going full steam ahead.

I unironically think the CSM - as evident by some of the upcoming changes - is essential to communicating the overall community‚Äôs wants &amp; needs and is vital in relaying what issues should be addressed for creating an environment of which we can all enjoy.
---
Heh, the timing for this is crazy considering in the most recent Goon fireside it was reiterated that selling caps/supers/titans outside of The Imperium gets you the instant kick and blacklist, no questions asked and you don't get to defend yourself. Yet HydeX is still the CEO of his TNT corp and is still marked blue. I guess the rules only apply to us peon linemembers.

By bringing up your own eviction and how it improved your corp you are heavily implying it's a similar situation.

It didn't have to happen to them at all. You saw an opportunity to kick over a new corp for easy loot and did so, such is the nature of WH space. Wear it with pride ala Inner Hell or MCAV. Don't try and make out that this is actually good for them or "had to happen".

And if I was Heaven's Angel's, I wouldn't trust you guys to "help set up a hole" any more than I would trust someone to double my ISK. Here's the thing, they already had a hole, and you burnt it to the ground.   
---
You don't have to have a reason to evict someone, but at least man up and state that and lets not bullshit on reddit now that you guys look like assholes. If it was a WHSOC eviction, why then is it Bluedagger and NJED posting the AAR with many discrepancies...
---
\* shrug \* Either way. Whatever the reasons, I will be happy if they stay in wormholes after this.

---
&gt;Factional Warfare has a lot of potential and could be great gateway to introduce new players to conflict in EVE. I recently heard that a few members of the community have set up a Factional Warfare discussion discord and I‚Äôm interested to see what conversations happen there.

&gt;It‚Äôd be nice to put some focus on FW down the road, but it‚Äôs not currently on a roadmap right now.

You can just team up with PH at jita undock and collect dank killmails like [https://zkillboard.com/kill/75920649/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75920649/),  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/75884285/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75884285/) and  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/75838150/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75838150/) .

you hear that? That‚Äôs the sound of my erection reaching critical trouser containment levels.

Thats a really long winded way of saying you did it for loot and then had to think of an excuse

This wasn‚Äôt even started by hk. This was a sound op who heavily dislike hosa due to their constant evictions of starter wh groups.

Playing with high sec status in high sec = easy
---
Playing with really low sec status in high sec limits your ability to freely travel and makes it hard to stick around in space because faction police shows up, and players can always freely engage you without CONCORD intervention.
---
The effort comes in a different form, but there is definitely effort required.

My ten year old computer runs 3 clients and world of Warcraft at the same time. Maybe get a ten year old computer on Craigslist?
---
Thrashers are awesome ships to start getting into. Knowledge of the game is sooooo useful as well. Knowing how the enemy ship is usually fit will really tell you how to engage.  My favorite fit is:
---
\[Thrasher\]
---
Gyrostabilizer II
---
5MN Y-T8 Compact Microwarpdrive
---
Initiated Compact Warp Disruptor
---
Fleeting Compact Web
---
280mm Howitzer Artillery II, Republic Fleet Depleted Uranium S
---
\[Empty High slot\]

Small Transverse Bulkhead I

Most things with an AB are toast. You keep them at 18km and blast away. The web can be used defensively, keep it over heated at all times... if anything comes in on you, web it at 13 as you burn away a pray.... NEVER GET CLOSE TO ANYTHING WITH A SCRAM!
---
You can also use the web offensively on kitey frigs if you can catch them, get close enough to a slicer and web it down and keep it at 8-9km so you can track it well orrrrr this is fast enough to sling shot him and GTFO. 
---
Good luck out there!
---
Yeah shooting other people should not be rewarding. Only shooting rats and running missions should give special rewards. Having negative sec means you are an evil and bad player who gets punished for going into highsec. That's how it should be. Also nullsec doesn't get bad boy points so it would be useful for them to never give bonuses to negative sec bad boys 
---
I don‚Äôt know how to shitpost on this - one side is P I R A T  losing a blingy shitfit and the other is Horde moral posting about getting a highsec kill...
---
yep and iirc the defenders will now the locations of the said structures
---
soldier tags only bring you to 0.  not higher.   any higher and u need to spend time ratting.
---
afk droen boating hubs is a way to do it.  but it also wastes time.   keep in mind security status goes up once per tic based on the highest bounty enemy.
---
so instead of afk ratting, you could undock every 15 mintues, kill a battleship rat, dock, and get the same.
---
but its easy to lsoe security status by doing criminal activity.   aka a mistake can hurt you.
---
but low security status?  no mistake can increase it.  
---
Now THIS is shitposting ! I was worried this meme was dead after some brainlet posted the eve uni one

A lot of people, myself included, love the concept of Eve and it's history, and stick around hoping CCP might get their heads out of their asses and make the game good
---
i wish citadels either allowed you to choose a hanger or it changed based on the type of structure you are in. these look really cool
---
First of all it was a nice fight with you guys, for the most part!  
---
It's also a nice cover story with the whole "They do nothing for newbros but recruit everyone and 1% is a scam" thing, I wouldn't have taken that story as someone who knows the reality but seems believable enough from an external standpoint.
---
With the drama u/Anoron_Secheh outlined a different story comes to light though if you then see things like this: [https://imgur.com/a/ZWju361](https://imgur.com/a/ZWju361)
---
As it is with most of these things there is little evidence for the actual money flow, but the single pieces fit together quiet nicely. So the story for most of us goes like this:
---
The New Jovians were paid by Mr. Didn't want those moons anyway to fuck around in the Wormhole since there was little to nothing for them to touch besides ganking people. As they put down their POS they probably noticed they bit of more than they can chew and picked up the batphone.
---
Guess he felt really strong after using mommys credit card and showing up at the end to "reveal" himself as the instigator. Trust me we already knew...
---
Yeah. No way I remember how to spell that correctly. I can‚Äôt even pronounce it. 
---
those poor dramiels :'( good video

I just want station interiors to not use 90% of my GPU

I'll check very thoroughly one more time today turn send in a support ticket If I can't figure it out. Thanks for the help! 
---
You should ask your doctor about attention deficit disorder.
---
cope? buy some more plex to line the pockets of the CCP overlords to replace what is lost... lol 
---
Honestly, I try not to fly (or anchor) anything that I would be upset losing. I saved and bought a few capitals before I really started using them... that way when I whelped the first one I wasn't sad since I had a replacement already fitted.  We all had a good laugh at my expensive... It is just a game... very consuming game but at the end of the day you shouldn't be that invested into it, that it effects you out of game. You won't land a good job, have a happy family, be healthy, own a mansion, etc because you are successful in eve.  (unless you are an RMT Botter lol) Keep it in perspective, just pixels. 
---
What I'd really like is to be docked, yet the interior shows me as sitting on the undock of the citadel. With options for view outside structure to show me my overview as if I was undocked. 
---
I don't think so, but you should talk to alphastar or sirfur in-game and they might let you join. Also, you can just stick in an alt in PH, we are a pvp focused open corp and we take in day 1 newbros. 
---
Hey just a tip: Do you know what happens when you have used all your cap charges and there are still people left shooting at you?
---
Do the reverse war dec move.
---
Join a bigger alliance. 
---
Then pay them to declare war on PIRAT.  
---
The mechanics have the alliance aggressor superseding the lower-tier corp war dec.
---
Then leave the alliance.

I like plain black coffee, no cream or sugar nonsense. I grind my own beans but its not any fancy coffee, just the cheap crap you buy at a local supermarket. I'm not big on teas, and I'm not big on traditionally hot beverages served cold (like iced coffee or iced tea).
---
Not currently it doesnt.
---
We just got wardecced because we owned a few Pos from when we were in a wh Corp. 
---
Hypothetically, assuming the auto-recall system failed because you were mid-scan or something, you would be stuck in a new hole with no bookmarks and no means of probing any signatures. You would need to prostrate yourself to locals to let you out, or else self destruct. A classy pilot ejects from his ship and self-destructs just his pod.
---
It helps the time to load into the game if you download the entire game.
---
It will also speed up grid load times if you have download the entire game option ticked
---
There is. Have your corp CEO offer your services as an ally in the war. This is done in a ingame UI when you open the war report.
---
Or just join Horde.
---
Upvotes for creative use of cuss words

Better get the mighty black finger to investigate. Clearly they are on top of all the things. Ask them to have a look at how Bastion is avoiding their ore taxes as well
---
64bit allows the use of more resources afaik, pretty sure you wouldn‚Äôt have problem in potato mode anyway
---
WE need pirate destro and bc
---
lmao ore taxes what
---
And get vaccinated? Are you fucking crazy? I could get autism!
---
Thx I aim to please!
---
well pirat is getting spanked in jita by horde :D
---
if you want to fuck with them too just help us when we fight them xD
---
Not like you have the option of shooting pirat in null, after all.
---
Unironically? Join Horde. Their standing fleet is open to the panfam alliance, and any chars set to blue status. You could also pm the fleet boss to get an invite. Lots of options. 
---
Yeah I can get that and I remember being in that position.
---
That being said the tools are available in most null alliances to never get caught, things like near2 and intel maps can give you a warning siren like 7 jumps out of your pocket to know hostiles are coming so even if you don‚Äôt bother reading intel you still get the warning, so getting caught out in something like a vni is actually pretty damn hard if you‚Äôre not afk. As someone who‚Äôs been on both ends of it, as a hunter you‚Äôve got about 5 seconds to Dscan the site and warp with a 8au per second captor to be able to get anything, and even then they‚Äôre warping off as you land most of the time.
---
The other end of it is even when response fleets form (and as I said before usually that is with absolutely overwhelming force already) some prick usually decides to take his cyno alt and drop a super on top of the already massive sub cap numbers.
---
As someone who‚Äôs done a bit of hunting(I‚Äôm admittedly not great but have flown with some who are damn good) and done the whole rorqual mining/super ratting vni ratting thing, the odds right now are ridiculously stacked in the defenders favour. While people often complain that roamers are always in kitey bullshit, it‚Äôs just your only option if you don‚Äôt want to get turbodunked, and that‚Äôs sad cause hunting ratters is damn boring
---
Maybe badphone snuff or siege green , heard Provi does that often

Our esteemed tall fleet commander Elo Knight leads a 30-man Machariel hit squad into enemy territory to thin the crab population. After a false start, the fleet snags its prey- but the kill was just the beginning of the fight. The long road home lays before us, enemies on our tail...

Very likely.

No.  There are plenty of other issues that need attention before ANOTHER ship...
---
...umm could you sit down over here? I need to tell you something...
---
occasionally killing a few drones doesn't "hurt" a hive. its barely an inconvenience. 
---
You could have prepped and next time baited the caps out and killed them but instead you went to evict them and you couldn't even do it on your own.
---
Soooooooo nothing new?

Tbh what i would like to see is a BO that was created thanks to  Sansha and Guristas cooperation.

what i am trying to say... i have many alphas, who reached 5mil SP/

they all received "free sp" in the past, for several times..

for now most of them get more than 5.5 mil

so they can use Skill Extractor

to produce Skill Injector
---
horray lez inflation runs fast!!
---
Sry bb u know I had to include it in the vid ;)
---
Not sure why. Horde creates content for the game. PIRAT creates content for themselves. Big difference.
---
And I explained several times that you can't just cyno jam whole systems based on broken fw mechanics. "Sit in a plex 20minutes in a frigate". It's even worse than the sov wanding stuff. There are other non-fw groups living/moving through fw space. If you can't learn to activate an accereration gate or using range to avoid cynos then other non-fw players shouldn't be penalized because of it.
---
i am trying to say "with that SP give away my alphas will be reaching 5.5 and be able to produce "free" Skill Injectors"

If you have followed their presentation at EVE Amsterdam, you would know that there is so much more to come inside the stations. Holograms of game news, clickable holograms of the fitting window, market,... , drones inspecting your ship, ect. . This is just the first stage in order to build on top of that.
---

---
Find easier targets. Haulers, miners etc. Or go after cynos. Blue dots in map statistics are cynos that you can shoot. They can't move and are often cheap ships without much defenses.
---
akshully we did do a bbq and it was fucking amazing.
---
That pos kill was hilariously amazing. PIRAT warped a bhaal Kiev with a killright available. A fleet member bought the kr and we nuked the guy while killing pos mods.

This is such an odd thread. Without even going into details on any of this, if you look at the other thread that was put up regarding this whole thing it obviously paints a different (picture)[https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b4axue/silent_coalition_loss_of_j105348/ej7ipo1?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x] of SICO. But really it doesn't matter which one is right.
---
All I'll say is that no money was exchanged from Tribesmen to anyone, there was no batphoning of any groups (barring SPAMV purely for the fort armor timer due to it being at a pretty bad time for both groups but that was 3 leshaks total), and we asked Stoseph if he wanted to come in to whore on the fort structure timer to get a little revenge. Again of course there's two sides to that story so it's not even worth going into.
---
I literally have chat logs of all this, I can show you myself reaching out to Stoseph asking if he wanted to move to WHs with his group which is what basically initiated our involvement with all this.
---
Well, that got personal 
---
Yeah the connection to Stoseph is a little fishy. 
---
We didn't think there was anything beyond "lets fuck with these guys" until the Reddit posting began.

This almost sounds like a transgender rights issue lmao

Found the bitter man.
---
That's FEDUP staging and next door to Legacy staging
---
Some changes I‚Äôve seen espoused multiple times:
---
1.  Citadels in FW space:  FW players cannot dock at enemy or neutral FW citadels.  FW citadels in enemy-controlled space suffer penalties, (market and Indy modules offline), greater vulnerability timers, higher DPS caps, low power state (maybe), always in reinforced (armor) state, etc.
---
2.  Warzone control / System plexing:  Only allow offensive plexing in systems adjacent to enemy controlled systems; this promotes battle fronts / front lines which focuses content.  Or require a systems ihub to be attacked (reinforced) which would allow a non-adjacent system to be plexed.  This prevents back system AFK plexing and reduces bot impact on FW.
---
3.  FW LP:  Implement an Incursion-like system where offensive plexing only pays out LP once a system is successfully conquered.  Award sufficient LP for killing enemy players; incentivize PvP not button spinning.  Maybe have ISK payouts based off of the amount of LP a player accumulated during a successful system conquest.
---
4.  System Conquering / Defending Mechanic Overhaul:  Instead if the current mechanic (plexing system until 100% + ihub bash), introduce additional PvPE *missions or complexes.  These new sites would put each FW playerbase against each other where they have to accomplish objectives (while preventing the other side from accomplishing theirs).  Defending your NPC fleet / SuperCap, attacking NPC bases, rescuing NPC VIPs, etc.  The successful completion of these sites accelerated the conquest/defense or provides system combat bonuses to FW players.  Limit non-FW player participation in these sites.
---
5.  
---
Angel anything man. Just give me all the Angel ships. How dope would an Angel recon be? Or even just a BC.
---
sounds like a familiar rhetoric coming from Shekel 
---
We had a great time, it was a learning experience for us all and we will continue to press forward. 
---
Keep on trucking my friend. Lots of good fits/tips already posted. 
---
Thing about eve is you could fight 2 of the same ship and they be totally different fits. Totally different fights. 
---
You're doing the lord's work. And also providing us Brave nublets with content at the same time. Bless you.
---
What's ISK for if not to use on shiny ships, capitals, and fun? We learned quite a bit and I see the losses as a small price to pay for entertainment.
---
I see now, i was jebaited myself. :) I really thought the first comment was a bait. Now i see /u/gohan924 probably meant it.

Good attitude, hope you get back up and running quick.   By the sound of your reply you did get enough krabbing in to be able to continue.
---
I don't think it would look that good to have the same model as a pirate ship since I think it looks pretty Policy lol But I think it is a very cool idea to have a ship that reacts to negative security status!
---
I'm not sure if there's a way to do it and stay in your corp... but you could Join Horde and the SIG doing the heavy lifting is open.  :-).  
---
Yeah it's a vicious circle. Roamers aren't roaming because there aren't any other small roams to encounter, and so they in turn don't roam.
---
There needs to be some kind of incentive for small scale PVP that isn't broken like FW.

They should have bonuses to reddit carma.

16GB is the minimum RAM for a system built today. To future-proof it you want 32GB especially with the 64-bit client around the corner. RAM prices are currently inflated beyond reason so you could buy 16 now and then add another 16GB next year. Go with the 8GB DIMMS since your mobo has 4 slots and you want dual-channel. Also don't get hung up on the overclocked/shielded/branded memory‚Äîperformance gain is not substantial for the higher price you pay‚Äî3200 is a good place to stop and even bare 2666 DIMMS are good enough, if you're looking for ways to limit cost.
---
You're paying a premium for that 8-core processor. EVE only uses a single thread, and this won't change with the 64-bit client. Consider the Ryzen 5 2600X 6-core which is still beefy and about 1/3rd less.
---
Check out the HP EX920 line of NVMe M.2 drive. Almost as good as the Samsung 970 EVO for a price similar to the 860 you're considering.
---
Consider adding a basic mechanical HD (Like a WD Blue 2TB 5400RPM) so you can take advantage of AMD's StoreMI. The tech comes free with your mobo. It combines the two drives into one large one and intelligently allocates your most frequently access files to the fastest drive so you don't have to fuss about partitions.
---
All that adds up to about 250W of power, or maybe 350W if you overclock the CPU and GPU, so a 500W PSU should be more than sufficient. PSUs operate most efficiently at 50% capacity.

i kinda expected more than 21 supers and titans to be smuggled. i could probably do that in a weekend without getting caught.

I've never heard that rule of thumb before, but I wonder how it scales as you add above a dozen clients. Must be a cpu bottleneck somewhere?

Either way, that's a great stat.

"If you look at it at the core then it‚Äôs more the price of ISK which is falling, rather than PLEX rising. The ease of which segments of EVE Players are able to generate new ISK into the economy, often without any risk or exposure to other players interfering is the crusp of the issue IMHO."
---
[citation needed]
---
where is this ama?
---
Hey all, wanted to share a little light on what was going on motivation wise for this op, at least from the whsoc side.
---
Initially we didn't plan on an eviction at all. We had someone in seadc that saw the ping for the pos njed put down, and we just formed what we had and came for a fight.
---
Once we got on grid, i made the decision to team up with njed and start popping seadc. From what I had been told, (by some of my guys) they were primarily a highsec group that used the wormhole as a farm hole, and they were primarily bears. That's what started the eviction process. Njed also didn't come initially for an eviction, they were also just looking for some brawls. I will say that the initial eviction idea was mine,  and I started that push, so if anyone's to blame here it's me.
---
Heaven's angels put up some really, really good fights, had a great attitude through the whole thing, and all in all were outstanding folks to be across the field with. After their initial capital fight it was pretty clear that we had the hole, it was just pushing the rest of the timers.
---
 At that point I started talking talking to the rest of our team about maybe exfilling. We'd gotten great fights, the guys on the other side had been awesome, we didn't need to go any further. I don't work in a vacuum though, and given that we had already committed with another group (njed) and we'd already set all the timers, asked people to be online, and been doing hole control for the past 24 hours, the decision was made to follow through with the eviction.
---
Personally, I'd have been happier leaving heavens angels there. If they decide to go it on their own as a wh group and need any help, I've offered to do whatever I can to make another wh move in easier on them. I know this doesnt really make up for evicting them in the first place, but its the best i can do.
---
TL:DR started an eviction,  thought it was a bad idea after a bit, got outvoted, evicted a newbro corp from wormhole space. Not my best moment.
---
Why use a rook, falcon, or tengu for a heavy armor brawl in wormhole space? There's no use planning around starting a fight off the hole and the widow can be a big swinging dick and sit with the rest of the fleet 
---
pssh doesnt help me when i die in mine ;D

C4 WH space is poison to children's minds and it creates a fake world for them to live in, they think they are safe from HK and LZHWK seeding 250 caps in their azbel, or from the inevitable 60 man TDSIN gila blob out for their rorqual but they are wrong and delusional, this will happen. C4 causes radiated autism which created anime and furries and this introduces pornographic material at a young age and has very graphic and violent scenes which rots your children from the inside. This carries over into adulthood and creates these lazy, nasty, hideous slobs that were once your children that now sleep with an anime/furfag body pillow at night and read mangas at least 10 times a day, this was caused because C4s take a long to time to scan to find content and this rots the brain, just like spodbrain. C4 scanning also consumes your soul and wastes time that could be used to go outside, get 60 minutes of fresh air, do homework and contribute something to society. The people who live in wolf rayets are not the problem, C4s are the problem, think about it, if C4s were deleted, the current C4 corps would move to the next cancer, Wolf rayets, and kill the current degenerates using stabbed cerberus (after their reload killed like 7 sabres of course) living there. C4 WH space is the root of all problems, cancer, war, Africa, anime, furries and Nazis. Since people have to scan sooo much for content on the monitor screen for hours, it uses electricity and is the reason why the oil reserves will run out soon.
---
C4 space causes cancer because it has been proven monitor screens emit radiation and radiation causes uncurable spodbrain cancer. spodbrain has caused war by inspiring the Nazis to side with the Japanese through their cartoons and establishing the Pacific Front in World War 2. African leaders in Africa are corrupted by spodbrain addiction inflicted in C4 wolf rayets as well anime and furry influences caused by this and they cannot tend to their peoples needs and cannot feed them. Future generations of wormholers will be ruined and destroyed by the C4 influence. Everyone thinks the downfall of humanity will be ourselves, but in reality it is spodbrain C4 rorquals . After the atomic radiation, the Japanese wanted to get their revenge on the world and created their ultimate weapon C4 wormholes, which led to the creation of anime, furries, nazis and commies.

My Grandfather was in holesale his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to quit immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He quit holesale immediately. Three years later he died of brain cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me: "Don't ever join holesale. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a shit-tier wormhole corp. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having tried it, because your post gave me brain cancer anyway.

Don't buy a Ryzen 7 2700x.  Wait until the summer to see what AMD are offering in terms of the next generation.  If it's decent, either your 2700x will be heavily discounted or you'll be able to pick up a 7nm part that's more powerful, perhaps with more cores, for the same price.
---
That ends-up being around 8-10 hours per week of VNI ratting in Null.   
---
That's a part-time job. 
---
Yeah exactly, its not allowed but people are doing it. I don't want to link to websites to spread the plague but a few prominent YouTube players resell PLEX for real world money and even offer discounts. It only dawned on me recently because I saw someone say "I bought from XXXX because they had a discount" basically going to the cheapest real money price. That is a massive issue for CCP, less money in CCP's pocket means less content for us in my opinion.

it's also pretty much entirely passive. how much time do you spend cooking dinner, doing the laundry, etc?

set your vni orbiting a rock while you get those tasks done and your account will plex itself and pretty much won't cost you any of your actual time what so ever.

alternatively - i wish my job was as passive as vni ratting, that'd be lovely.

Have they changed wormhole mechanics in the recent years? Back when I used to live in a wh the new static didn't spawn until someone initiated warp to it, meaning you could close all the wormholes and farm in relative safety.

Fair comment! So that would imply that any third party would also have to be remotely competent.

Sounds to me like someone didnt reach out for the proper info. SEADC might even be a carebear corp, but the people coming to the wh were specifically instructed on how we roll here, and were more a part of HVEN than they were SEADC. In general, the only ones you really hurt with this eviction were HVEN¬¥s and committed member of SEADC that wanted to join HVEN and their mentality.

There were only two corps that deployed to Gehi late last year - Sinners and MVN - the rest of NC. USTZ was too busy krabbing or camping M-O to show up, and there was zero support outside of discord typing despite the lofty objectives given for the deployment, so the FCs burned out fast and the net effect was negligible.

The issue is that I did reach out, I had to go through 3 directors to even figure out who the lead person of the WH group was, and even then I was just invited to a joint ops channel. It doesn't help that HA's evewho still states they're a HS entity, which would make the direct link to SEADC seem much more complete. There was a ton of misinformation, I'll fully admit that, but it wasn't for lack of effort.

As far as I know this is right. Back when I did C4 trash sites I noticed missing spawns too, came back after a while to hack the rest only to get ambushed by a bunch of sleepers out of nowhere.

---
I agree with the issue but not the solutions, personnaly i‚Äôd like to see something along the lines of :
---
-minimum of 1000KM distance from another upwell structure.
---
This allows the defenders to respond from the citadel but not within mere seconds. Currently the defenders can undock a carrier and send their fighters to the gate within 30 seconds because of bullshit 15000ms fighters. 
---
-spool up time for a small amount of time, say 10 seconds to at least give attacks a chance to tackle people who warp to the jumpgate without caution.
---
-a polarization timer of 5 minutes just like in wormholes would suit the new jumpgates aswell.
---
Funny how NC noticed titans moving but goons didn't know of their own titans moving...
---
Technically it's a recolored caldari one. The original is blue, the upwell is orange.

So to be fair you have to make a point about 1. it's cool dudes sell shit out of Goons or 2. no one sell cheap shit out of an alliance to make his own benefit.

This sounds simply like damage control for me.

yes, isk is falling but everything else except plex is staying relatively the same

CPU bottleneck will be a issue when starting all the clients. Once loaded to memory the system should be stable.

Not anymore. The load lag I get at Jita 4-4 makes it impossible to warp to my bm before I get alpha'd. I've switched to a system of moving everything to another station in a reinforced freighter, then transferring to an IttyV or whatever.

To a certain extent I would say yes but it's really dependant on your play style.
---
Totally agree, capitals should be very powerful ships with very limited mobility, not just the superior weapon you dump on everything larger than a frigate. Capitals have BETTER strategic mobility than subcaps in a lot of situations thanks to their jump engines.

Well played Horde. Well played. 
---
I'll give another perspective entirely (at least I haven't seen it here yet):
---
I live in w-space for usually year-long stretches before getting evicted. Eventually it will happen.
---
Live in the hole a few months before you try to move in again; some holes just get more connections than others, and spending time analyzing zkill and seeing the traffic can be really useful in picking a good hole.
---
Try setting up another cit when you're ready, but if it happens again, take some downtime outside w-space to cool off; get some smaller wins for your buddies before trying at it a third time, cause losing 3 in a row would be brutal.
---
Unfortunately, anchoring is the most dangerous time because of the lack of reinforce timers, and there's no way around that other than to drop a cit, cloak up, and pray. Even if you have a fleet, fleets invite fights. Cloak and log most of your guys off at a safe spot. If anyone messes with your cit, you can assess and see whether the fight is worth it. Sometimes just logging your guys back in all at once is enough to scare off would-be bashers. Otherwise, if it's a fight you know you can't win, there's no point losing a cit and your fleet.
---
Also, if you're interested in a co-habitation situation, DM me; I've got a setup in a cozy C1 + HS static. I get good fights (which is what I'm there for) and I also don't actually farm the sites, so your guys would be welcome to them.
---
The hurdle consists of getting the largest blob of players together that is possible so the vast majority doesn't have to contribute shit at all.
---
It's just unlimited scaling, there is literally no downside to being larger. Without jump bridges you at least have to be at an actual location to intervene, instead of just merrily arriving from the other side of your empire in a couple jumps.

Honestly I would jump on that bandwagon immediately. If there is nothing special hidden in upcoming lore about Trigs and Sanshas, there is no reason against it. The lack of it just makes the whole south too safe. Simultaneously CCP needs to implement one last additional NPC Region inside the Dronelands.
---
Fatigueless JB's were removed for a reason, the exact same shit happened.
---
They will have -everything- including a T3 Trig cruiser line!
---
Freighters / Jump Freighters, a Trig Orca / Rorq version, a black ops, command ship, a carrier, super carrier, dreadnaught and a Trig titan. The whole lot will include a barge and an exhumer too.
---
why would the gsm allow a lowsec connection?
---
CCP is saving the T3 version for after they nerf other nullified ships and cloaking. This trig ship will require abyssal nulli and cloaking mods, but allow you run away and escape from anything you want. Top seller 2025.
---
Think they‚Äôll go p far with it, and as mentioned at eve Amsterdam they are thinking of a non-trig line of precursor ships which could be interesting ‚úåÔ∏è

They should give it to him already for his sheer determination.

I am exited on how they will implement the triglavian bomber. Maybe the bomb will be fired if you turn the launcher off again and charges up in the meantime?

Triglavian stuff can be interesting in all aspects up to dreads and faxes also I suppose Titans.
---
The only ships I cant see how the Trig mechanics can be applied is like carriers or supers but that could be their selling point by focusing purely on direct affect mechanics vs fighters/drones etc

Is it possible to use Upwell Cargo Deposit to sell items to an existing buy order within range of the station, if I don't have access to dock/market there?  Thank you.

Call it the pirat clipper, have it limit the amount of T2 and T1 mods you can place on it and give it a higher scan res when stationary. Hell, give it bastion.

I'M CRIPPLINGLY HOMOSEXUAL AND CAN'T GO MORE THAN A SECOND WITHOUT SUCKING COCKS, HOW BOUT YOU?
---
They probably want to fill out their ship tree pretty fully, they have a whole new weapon system to play with and balance around and the lore seems to be angling to put the Trigs along side the 4 empires as a major faction. Whether or not they fill out the t1 line and do two of each t2 class like the empires have is a question. One per ship type will already take them years to release at their current pace (good thing IMO, better to do it slowly than dump a bunch of poorly conceived ships at once) so a second would be far in the future.
---
Shouldn't that be Origin...?

Nice video bud.

Depends on how deep you wanna dive in. A lot of players only get in touch with the economy when selling their loot to buyorders or buying stuff directly of sellorders. That won't teach you anything.
---
BUT - the EVE economy is a full scale model of a nearly unregulated market economy that economic scientists have written essays about. So if you dive in deeper, like figuring out a complete chain from resource harvest to final product, collecting intel about the competitors, checking market movements over a longer period and so on you can really learn a lot.

There is a reason EVE is called "Excel in Space".

A serious response from someone who's been working with the guys at the Discourse and would like to consider themselves as up on this as any player could be at the moment.
---
It's very unlikely as you said they would duplicate a ship type that went out as a trophy ship. They might but I would bet not for quite some time. 
---
Considering the current shipyard teases the next up and likely to be teased at the next Fanfest location (Either St.Petersburg or EVE Down Under in Sydney) is a capital ship. Best guesses based on the design and clues are a Dreadnought. But CCP is perfectly willing to sow red herrings in with legit clues so take nothing as confirmed until CCP confirms it.

When looking at ships, let's say the garmur, it doesn't show which racial frigate type gives which bonus. For example, Gallente frigate: +scram/point range per level.

Also, how do you see changes in damage or range when you swap between different ammo types for fitted weapons?

I **LOVE**  my HS static. I exclusively live in holes with HS statics. It gets you the best fights in the world, because
---
1) they're just transient threats. They're not trying to evict; they're just taking an opportunity to brawl.
---
2) they often don't know how to handle wh fights where they can't see how many opponents are in system, etc, and it throws their game off.
---
3) they take the obvious bait stuff that more experienced hole corps won't touch with a 10-foot pole. ("Hmm, why is that Marauder sitting in a site worth less than it's AIF? Whatever, let's attack it!" \*HAW dreads land\*)

Hey DK, I'm assuming you are a higher-role member in WHSOC because you had influence. Please forgive my lack of knowledge of your structure over there.

But if you didn't agree with proceeding, why did YOU stick around? Why let a wildfire keep burning? Stand up and leave to prove a point. Unless you wanted to be there but are playing good???

More people shoot first, why not actually dig up the story before getting lost in the loot sauce. Another krab krabbing is another pilot for me/us to hunt.

It just amazes me how long it's taken a large group to do this to them. We were doing this with a dozen guys years ago but never had the guns for the big stuff the hubhuggers would undock.
---
Unlimited power projection just leads to an infinite +1 meta. Blobbing giving an advantage is fine but should have limits. 
---
More numerical forces should be able to be outmanoeuvred so at least local superiority can be achieved by smaller forces. Numerical superiority should be achieved at a LOCATION. unlimited jump travel just makes position irrelevant and turns overall numerical superiority to superiority everywhere. 
---
i was too busy panicing to notice. i thought the game bugged lol i was scared was out of time so i hit gate then noticed it was the origin gate... kinda proud i managed to clear it tho
---
I have got my DST alt through Tama/Noutv gate on 3 seperate occasions with not ao much as a thrasher on the gate. Sad times :(
---
While I generally disagree with your "git gud nub" first paragraph, I do agree that talking to the people attacking you is almost always a good thing.
---
Sometimes they will tell you how they found you or mistakes you made, sometimes they'll give you advice or even fittings, and hey, sometimes it might even humanize you to them and make them decide to not burn everything you own.

thx didnt even got that memo :)

12 second charge then instant blap. No bomber would ever survive on the field for 12 seconds, but that'd be really satisfying lol

Well yes of course I'm sure there were other faucets to the dunkathon that OG NC eventually crumbled to. Selling supers to neutral or hostile entities ideally doesn't fit the goals of alliance leadership's. Just was making light if the situation without typing up a wall o text.

---
Hey /u/Anoron_Secheh, I'm glad you wanted to get a post in. There's a billion narratives and numerous people trying to spin things around here. As I can only truly speak for NJED, I'll stick to what I know. 
---
We were never contacted by any outside sources regarding interacting with you in any way except until we met WHSOC on that wormhole. WHSOC simply asked if we wanted to assist in removing SEADC from the hole. We said sure since we were planning on being here for a couple of days anyway. 
---
NJED had never planned for an eviction. What we wanted was some good fights. We place a POS or small citadel down as a way to promote a fight at a timer we are in control of and provide a bit of storage for refits. We have done this many many times the past year and a half. We generally leave after we lose our ships (happens most of the time) or get a solid fight or two. We had talked about going after one or two of your Athanors as a way to promote a fight, but that was the extent of our original goals. 
---
After the cap fight on our POS, it was pretty clear we broke your hopes. There was definite talk of "should we just pull out? Are there any caps left? Will they fight for the Fort?". This is where we may have sinned and chose to stay and follow through. The Athanor timers were coming up and then after that it was just 13 hours until the Fort timer on a Saturday where everyone was excited to log on for. 
---
Obviously, you guys saw this and took the opportunity to evac what you could to the Raitaru or in interceptors and such out. I know we still wanted to make this hard for you, but certainly not impossible. I had brought up the idea of dropping hole control to give SEADC/HA one last hurrah for the Fort, but we had several hostile entities independent of your group gunning for us so we had to hold. 
---
I really hope HA is not discouraged by this event to stay around in w-space. If we can help get you back on your feet in any way, please let us know. There's obviously a lot of people who hate our guts for putting a knot in a content faucet. I won't deny our actions were more deafening than usual and brought you to the edge of complete loss.
---
im glad to hear youre doing well. dont forget to take advantage of government resources that are there for you. (: good luck
---
And the need to gate Caps would give Subs the legit position they should be in: Escorting the big hitters, clearing the way for them. The sheer amount of combats and tactical maneuvers possible around this are enormous.  
---
Besides: Safe-fleets will be subs. Or local caps. The farther an entity expands roomwise the more likely it d be "just ~~drop~~ warp in the supers" wont work anymore and subs needa run in to safe the day for someone.

The Cal-Gal warzone finally died when the Caldari Militia Coalitikn disbanded (BLOC led the departure and left FW altogether, TEMPLIS stayed in FW but moved to null, HECON stayed but most members are in a hiatus).
---
Snuff proximity, FW getting little luv, citadels, and 3-1 odds (against Calmil) led to leadership deciding to leave.  Many prominent Galmil entities officially left a few months later.
---
Mostly smaller groups left excluding Salt Farmers who strangely joined Calmil... (they probably should‚Äôve done that before the CMC disbanded... maybe the warzone would‚Äôve gone down a different path.
---
There are no more week-month long sieges involving dozens of battles, hundreds of pilots, thousands of ships, and billions of ISK.
---
Maybe after a few more months, the warzone will  one off of life support... maybe some old faces will come back and start the CMC anew.

If they end up wanting to add a covops/recon they will just make new ones. AT ships are made with the expectation that they will have a limited number of.

A system that launches a device that sticks to the hull. Over time it increases the heat it puts out, causing massive damage to the ship. [just speculating]

---
Have you considered that maybe, just maybe, skullfucking somone's income source doesn't paint you in a sympathetic light? That aside by the time i dock up and reship the roamers are gone anyway. Which leaves me either sitting on undock waiting for people to come attack us so i can help defend, not making money. Or running my VNI where i can't help fight attackers.
---
Attackers that just run away as soon as we mobilize any kind of response cap subcap it doesn't matter. sometimes they just use their spies in comms to run away as soon as we start considering fighting back. So maybe you can forgive me for not believing for a microsecond that you guys actually want fights. 
---
Yeah dude, sure. You have Bluedagger saying one thing. Someone else in WHSOC saying another and now you with this story. Which one is the truth? Are any of them out there. [THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpqffgak7To) 
---
edgy
---
Protection may not entirely rely on numbers, but when you have mega alliances that can bridge around hundreds of ships in a single fleet because they have hundreds of Titans on standby at any given moment(or just drop the titans themselves) it's pretty easy compared to an alliance with maybe a few hundred members total. 
---
I'd love to see some benefits given to attackers like a cyno inhibit rework, but I think the problem won't be fixed unless the entirety of the sov system is reworked, yet again. This time in a way that actually weakens the monolithic nullsec empires, gives people a reason to fight over space and to go back to the more fragmented sov maps of a few years back. 
---
Also, something needs to happen to restore wormholes as the small group heaven they used to be, because right now from what I see and hear they're a worse krabland than nullsec even.

Give me three CCP Falcon memes and a lowsec gate to Stain in advance and I'm in. This is my best offer. I'm a professional!
---
Three, similar gating to jump clones on a smaller timer
---
Falcon NO. give me the beer. your not supposed to drink while working!
---
*puts beer in a POS*  you can have it back once you finish getting sober.
---
&gt; That being said the tools are available in most null alliances to never get caught, things like near2 and intel maps can give you a warning siren like 7 jumps out of your pocket to know hostiles are coming
---
That's why i've never been caught. But being unable to go afk makes making isk via vni ratting tortuous and unfun. Especially when you can't use the best systems because they are cloaky camped.
---
&gt;The other end of it is even when response fleets form (and as I said before usually that is with absolutely overwhelming force already) some prick usually decides to take his cyno alt and drop a super on top of the already massive sub cap numbers.
---
That "prick" as you put it is as bored as you are. Half the time when i see caps undock in catch as a response either were saving someone from being dreadbombed or there's literally like 4 of us available to defend so nothing else could do it. (it's send 2-3 haw dreads to chase em off or whelp 4 caracals and hope they leave?) And 1/4th the time those caps get dreadbombed from stain anyway.
---
&gt;As someone who‚Äôs done a bit of hunting(I‚Äôm admittedly not great but have flown with some who are damn good) and done the whole rorqual mining/super ratting vni ratting thing, the odds right now are ridiculously stacked in the defenders favour. While people often complain that roamers are always in kitey bullshit, it‚Äôs just your only option if you don‚Äôt want to get turbodunked, and that‚Äôs sad cause hunting ratters is damn boring
---
Do you understand though, how its hard for me to have sympathy for you? Remember, you are worried about being turbo dunked, while turbo dunking people.
---
They should make one of the systems in Stain low security. Voila, done.
---
Csm doesn‚Äôt actually allow anything, they just propose changes and give feedback. And it‚Äôs not like CCP wouldn‚Äôt be suspicious of some people‚Äôs motives if all the Imperium members were against a gate and the rest were for it

My god. Need.

I was in TRI, I saw it all coming a while ago and tried to warn people. Nothing came of it so I left.

Can you guys just nut up and say you wanted the loot pi√±ata after the cap feed lol. This narrative of ‚Äúwe had to stay because timers‚Äù is so backwards.
---
Ah, I thought they'd gotten a new one.
---
I don't see why the existence of the Tiamat would prevent CCP from introducing a regular Triglavian recon. They've introduced lots of T2 prize ships that coexist with regular T2 ships of the same race and class - the Etana and Cambion, for example.
---
&gt;Doesn't care, continues to mine.

If you unsubbed just because of a minor missing aesthetic then you're probably not going to enjoy the rest of the game anyways.

---
only Black Legion. has broken up and reformed 2/3 times. 0rigin. has never broken up.
---
great vid
---
Also, by most accounts holesale is a PvP corp in the same way pirat is.
---
It does make kinda sense if down the line Trigs align with one of the major empire or major pirate factions. This would allow integration of the primary Trig technology into existing ship lines. The big contender for this is of course Amarr, because Trigs are supposed to be an Amarr offshoot, so you could end up with Amarr / Precursor ships. But it could be some other faction.

It's bad for me, I'm sure hostile alliances will use it to, say, stage a bunch of dreads to drop on our lemmings who yolo their supers to save a freighter. But overall I think healthy NPC null is important, it's a place where new alliances can grow, so just do it. 
---
Goon linemember have no problem defending a traitor
---
Trig ships have a very good drone capacity but not actual drone bonuses for either DPS, HP or application. So it could perhaps be tackled from a volume perspective on a carrier while it could retain some disintegrator abilities ? 
---
But volume carrier would mean really bad to fly use in tidi as well as contributing to it.

https://i.redd.it/8tj14r2tkx711.png
---
Neither is true. Real life markets and Eve markets have nearly nothing in common. Things you can do to Eve markets have inconvenient labels like "insider trading" and "securities fraud" and "human rights violation" in real life.
---
&gt; CCP could just ask the community
---
  Gevlon years ago proposed highsec titans that stay in the system it's built in- can fit mining lasers and do nothing but mine rocks in that system forever- It was his idea to "fix ganking". Should CCP have implemented that idea?

  That is what happens if CCP listened to and implemented every single smooth brain idea rolling around out there

What are the odds
---
Unfortunately there is not much you can do. There is one thing that may work out for you. Park some cloaked up neuts in their systems. They will have to eventually either come back out to rat or permamently stay docked. If its some cheap AFK ratting operation you will get kills, if its more organized with some better players behind the ratters you will get counterplay as they will be ready for you.

Kills are to be had, ratters die daily. Just git gud and kill them before your competition. Or kill your competitor. 
---
use your blue alt as a covert in cyno. Or log off trap /cloaky camp it.
---
NEAR2 is great for the game guys!

How to fix FW?
---
And his carrier ready to drop and save him. I know from personal experience. A lot gets edited out of his videos.

I'm Hoss Fever, one of our lead Fc's and one of the 5 directors for VITA. We tend to work as a democracy, ish, at least among leadership. The other directors that had an opinion one way or another wanted to stay. I thought we should leave. I got outvoted. If i was the one completely in charge i probably would have pulled us out.

imagine using blue eyes and still not able to catch anything

700 DPS scram-immune cruisers cannot fight back?
---
Get me a pleasure hub skin and I will buy all the plex ingame for that skin
---
Then you are doing it wrong.
---
It was not so isolated before all the changes over the time. 
---
personally, when i run a thrasher its this \^\^ arty  fit but with transverse bulkhead rigs and a damage control. main thing is you are new so you will need to figure out what happened and how to overcome in each fight. ex: thrasher fights kikimora, loses, due to kikimora always being able to out class a thrasher for the most part. ex2: thrasher loses to a navy comet with tracking disruptor who orbits at 10km, due to tracking disruptor reducing gun range, need to switch to barrage (or faction long range) faster. 
---
intel channels.  not intel bots.  
---
if you see someone, they will report you.  
---
Depends on what you're hunting. For carriers your best bet is use a blue alt with cov cyno. Sit in an anomn with a carrier, when he warps off and leaves grid decloak, drop cyno, bridge in hyper spatial fit tackle and fleet warp to the anom the carrier warped to. Hope you guessed the right range, point carrier and light covert cyno to drop your fleet in.
---
maybe we should connect tama to every part of npc null - that way it can become a superhighway to content
---
You'll have to excuse pyx... He's Wingspan. They know shit about shit when it comes to WH's.
---
I think the bomb would stay "as is" but it would have a disintegrator instead of torpedoes as its second weapon. Just imagine Leshak size disintegrator on a frigate ! Also since bombers are frigates and Trig ships are super low sig and fast mobility, this might make such bombers quite powerful.
---
God I remember this from years ago when I ran c4s
---
A) you overestimating how much the average line member cares who leadership runs over with the bus for being a traitor. B) The guy is in TNT
---
I think this is less a Horde Morale posting and more 'Hey guys, lookit this comedy mail.'
---
There‚Äôs currently A LOT of hate toward FW. It‚Äôs still a great way to get in a quick form of PvP, even more when in command of small ships, but they are botted to hell with Atron or Venture just farming the plexes for our robot overlords...
---
You can still join any militia you want and have a blast tho
---
should have worded it "STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM"
---
Excited to see how this one goes!
---
Unless they are already on their way or scanning something.
---
They will never add a lowsec connect to Stain because it would destroy the unique geography by doing so. 
---
Shes a very stable genius
---
That... Would be less efficient than just buying PLEX from CCP. 
---
Im sure once the art team starts rioting over skin ver. 314234597820, they'll turn to high micro-transaction station vanity items...
---
Well Horde is or was one of the big groups that long ago that war on hi-sec non stop. killing anyone that put a market up.  
---
What a bunch of bullshit.
---
As was this reply, and your original comment 
---
Once I ended up in a hole with an Oracle. I called out in local ‚Äúkill me or show me the way out!‚Äù A local fought me and died, then he honorably reshipped and showed me the exits. 
---
Looking forward to it!
---
Tbh i don't buy skins but for station interiors i would pay without a doubt.
---
Also we need bigger art team, there's so much to be done
---
What did I say that contradicts DK? The decision to stay and hit the Fort was on WHSOC. NJED couldn't take it on by itself. WHSOC left the Raitaru to us if we wanted to bash it. We chose not to.
---
Any recommendations for a guide on Low/Null sec PVE or PVP? I'm rather new and learning the ropes still
---
Make it simple , press the third option ; burning Malpais and the Spire.
---
Goon mad that people are talking about the systems which allow them to gain a disproportionate amount of ISK
---
Quelle surprise.
---
That is basically what happened in the 0-0 dreadbomb. half the stories I heard mention some random line member calling for supers to jump and a bunch of idiots in hels jumping in despite the FC having only called for 2 boson titans to X up.
---
It's good that you call it an intel bot, rather than actually learning how it works. That way, you cultivate a sense of learned helplessness and never try to figure out how it works, thus ensuring it continues to work correctly.
---
I've made multiple suggestions - Make Nullsec PvE a fleet based activity similar to incursions with similar pay outs with opportunities for 100-200 man fleets to grind something for ISK . Finish the pirate FOB to  include Serpentis and Angels, increase the pay out slightly in high sec. Finish the Resource Wars content. Do literally anything to breathe fresh life into faction warfare. Revamp cyno's so that they either provide immediate, but not overwhelming firepower to a given space or overwhelming, but not immediate firepower, instead of both. Remove asset safety from Null Sec. Remove skill injectors. Either allow 3 characters to train at once, or allow 3 characters to be played at once so the single account subscriber can be relevant. Reduce training time across the board. Remove basic fitting skills and refund the players that have them trained.
---
You able to share anything about your study? Like maybe your credentials? Sounds lame and fake tbh. 
---
3 times to gehi. you can just look at the systems cit losses for the dates. First time was to harass delve, they just fed t3 fleets. Second time to help pl take provi, that worked out in the end /s. Third time they just fed mrfriskers titan 200 killmarks and undeployed.
---
everything is a narrative, nothing can be done in good fun
---
sad mindset tbh
---
tl;dr ?
---
"Go get titans dropped on you because that's my free content"
---
You know what? Have an upvote.
---
The at ships usually have two roles in ine, though.
---
The etna is a covops but also a logi ship.
---
Was this your rorqual? 
---
Glad you're making Syndicate great again.
---
FYI, If you're still looking for dreads I think we still have some in Syndicate from when Dredd was out there.
---
Well it would make sense for a quantity over quality approach due to trigs hooking up with rogue drones. 
---
Abyssal pvp is the solution.
---
Lol
---
I have no credentials and I don't plan to publish in any sort of publication. I'm just a person curious in how people learn from games and wondered if anyone had similar experiences to some of the things I've learned from games. I've spoken to people and read stories about how some people attribute at least some of their success to their background in playing certain kinds of games. I myself was able to translate my interest in pricing mechanisms and a fascination with calculating profits and losses via algorithms at a young age that lead me to a career in software engineering.
---
just remove local
---
In other words: PLEX price is where CCP wants it to be. They control all parameters of the sandbox and dont see a need for change or intervention.
---
A) me seeing an opportunity to shitpost
---
B) me seizing said opportunity to shitpost
---
I run 20 clients on 16gb of ram, chilling at 96% usage.
---
The cpu barely gets used and for me the disk is my bittleneck (don't have an ssd yet).
---
I usually start all my clients then go get something to eat for 10 mons and come back with my computer calmed down and ready to play.
---
&gt; Remove skill injectors. Either allow 3 characters to train at once
---
  I was agreeing with you until I saw this. Skill enjectors can't be removed now. They're too ingrained in the economy- not to mention the overwhelming outrage from players that use them for income generation. Training three characters per account for free- and logging then all in- you get the same issue of rorqs and supers being trained rapidly. Instead of one super alt being trained up per account, you triple that.
---
I use Splashtop but you won‚Äôt be escaping a gank with it... 
---
So, I'm pretty into both OSRS and Eve. OSRS's economy is extremely broken, because the goal in that game is to earn XP, not to earn money/power like it is in Eve.
---
This causes a bizarre dynamic where raw materials are worth *more* than the finished product, and you earn money by killing bosses. 
---
In WoW, you use professions to earn money to get gear/consumables to raid. In Eve, you earn money to PvP. In RS, you raid to earn money to purchase raw materials.
---
It's the exact opposite to how most games work, making it hard to compare. Likewise, you can't compare this to real life - no reasonable person will buy things to sell them at a loss. But in RS, that's explicitly the point, because you earn XP for doing so.
---
How about the little men in legacy that are only allowed to bear in immensea instead of their home sov to keep adms high while test members are safe in esoteria? Wonder how they feel 
---
If plexes are "botted to hell" with stabbed ships, does that mean it's fairly empty for a human do do so?
---
I don't mind the PvP aspect of it, but I do mind not being able to fund myself getting out there.
---
Who do you think you are suggesting something like that?  I could lose my ship ya know?!?!  Are you trying to get me kilt? 
---
D√©pends of where you are. If you get deep in a quiet part of lowsec, you‚Äôre good, and generally the bots won‚Äôt bother you while you gather some funds for your PVP activities. Another thing to do might be FW missions.
---
But as with everywhere, you‚Äôll sometimes see a neutral or a player belonging to an enemy militia strolling through your systems and ready to pick up a fight. Just need to find which systems are good just to run plexes, and which aren‚Äôt (don‚Äôt do it in Tama, for example).
---
umm, those are projectile turrets.
---
Hybrids are still great. Brawly in the catalyst or for a sniper corm.
---
The interesting thing I've noticed in my own experience, especially in regard to managing finances personally, is when I work to earn money to get gear or level up skills I am hyper aware of the cost, how much I can afford, how I can most efficiently attain my goal within a budget that I've established while also considering trade-offs like other things I could be doing with my time rather than leveling up the way I'm doing it. I find this interesting because it isn't something that's necessarily a direct skill that I've learned from the core mechanics of the game, rather its something I've picked up while playing and I've been able to translate to real life. I've read some articles where people that run companies or manage projects can attribute some of their knowledge back to the games they played.
---
Kikimora is crying somewhere in the corner.

dont kink shame. I hear losing rorqs with a mouth full of cock feels great.

The best way to learn how to live on those areas of space is honestly to join a corporation that does so. Do your research, and find a corp that seems like a good fit for the kind of playstyle you are after. (ie avoid corps that claim to do everything)
---
Honestly, I don't even give a shit about super capital/rorqual proliferation anymore. I just don't. Let the guy's that run 20+ accounts have 40 more supers, I don't think it'll change anything at all that isn't already present, i.e the wealthiest people in real life having access to the most tools/income generation.  Supers/Carriers need to be balanced to fulfill a certain niche in the same vein that all subcaps are balanced for. Not the end all be all.    
---
Anyways, for 15 bucks a month you'd think you'd be able to play the game proper, but multiboxing is a must have to enjoy the game and actually efficiently dive into all the content that's available. New players quit because the game is boring as shit and takes literal fucking months to make 15m ticks in a VNI. The isk grind is literally worse than the old dime a dozen Korean grinders from the 2000's.

Haha, so like 7 years ago I was a noob who was excited to haul my first billion isk in loot from nullsec to sell in Jita (mostly salvage from relic sites, iirc). A few days later I had to haul some stuff around Rens and accidentally bought a Badger for a billion isk, instead of a million (had market sorted the wrong way, clicked too fast, etc). It sucked, but was also kind of funny. I named it "billion isk badger" and I think I still have it, although it might have been repackaged at some point. Anyway, I now keep most of my money in my alt corp's account so that doesn't happen anymore. :)
---
someone can warp out of a site before you can land in one
---
programs can immediately alert someone when someone enters system or nearby -&gt; means there is no real ability to catch those people unless they're legit afk
---
stainguy dosent actively live in stain
---
Yes, meant low
---
I understand they're very different, but I wonder if the act of mastering arbitrage in game would help someone understand the core concept of buying and selling on the stock market. Of course it isn't a direct comparison, we have all sorts of rules in the real world, but skills like following the news around new product offerings (new game items or features) or studying sales reports may be helpful skills to nurture inside the game.
---
CCP indicated right after the Marshal was released that they wanted to do something similar, and I think that's a horrific design choice. At this stage in the game, it would require extensive farming to get standings up which is difficult for all but the most hardcore players AND meta shifts will be increasingly difficult.
---
I Agree man the dramiel is actually pretty low tier in my opinion at least any that only use a single web and small anci anyway. Really like the dual web one as it guarantees range control in a fight, The dual rep one can prob do great things to but requires bling and I aint about that.
---
Wow, you are special.  First, never claimed to be a wizard.  Second, it doesn't take a wizard to know that if you have only 5 total slots to fit, trying to dual tank is stupid.  Seriously, it is.
---
Now, if you would like, you can find my alts that do have solo kills ;)
---
Well arnt you a deadset fucking cunt
---
Deep dude. That got me. We've lost some pilots on the way.  But I've gotten a lot of new ones. Which is and has been very worthwile.
---
Ouchhh welp, #yolo
---
Yes, in fact, it IS implied when you are complaining about the fleet bringing overwhelming odds.  
---
Option C: Stick to the game plan and spin this into the classic "this is actually good for goons" narrative.
---
&gt; Seriously, is there a database of their structures somewhere, would like to not waste this opportunity. 
---
Hmm, this really sucks, I just spent like 15 min looking in game and can't find it. Only thing listed is the HQ in Amarr space but I'm not even sure if that's an NPC station or not. this is something CCP definetly needs to take a look at and address. 
---
Why not a damage bonus instead? Would fit more into the theme of an outlaw pilot anyways in hit-and-run tactics.
---
Would have to be balanced though, so I would suggest that below -5.0 is when it would start to kick in which would be official outlaw or pirate status.
---
If you divide Stain by ten what npc region you will get? 
---
We had to try doing it. We failed much to our sorrow. But still tried. 
---
A lot of corps now have their own discords and stuff and much easier to get a hold of and chat up, making it easier to find a decent crew
---
Well we are a red-based zkillboard corp. We take pride in our reds. I guess this one is a nice one in the collection!
---
Do you know how to read
---
This literally has not changed. the war for perimeter has not ended, horde simply lost the first battle.

The rolls are reversed and now Test will take the place of horde. If they can.

Nah, this group are harsh. Just "bullies". They did not care.

I did this. I went and replayed with an alpha Ibis. It has been a great thing for me to do, relieve old memories, see how far I've actually come from those days.

Move a goon Sig into Jita;  all of hisec will be very confused when the null boys start fighting in the gracelands.
---
Here CCP, this is my wallet, take what you want. 
---
Because the  best possible thing to do to pirat was not feed the trolls ships or reddit salt. Now the best possible thing is to salt them to figurative death, so they quit or mend their ways and take the cancer to nullsec/wormholes where it belongs.
---
Sounds like you subscribe to the "Never not shit post club". Nice!
---
Damn, that's not the answer i was looking for. But hats off to you sir. 
---
My corp has lost something like 15 structures so far.  I've honestly lost count.
---
I personally deal with loss by shrugging it off, learning from the experience if possible, and usually heading to Jita to buy a replacement.
---
My first big loss was a 1.2b ISK ship I lost by being stupid.  My corp reimbursed it.
---
When I say my corp, I mean it, as I'm still the CEO (alt) and I created the reimbursement policy for all member ships lost during corp fleets.
---
My corp reimbursed a member's dread that was stuck on the wrong side of a wormhole, so we told him to self-destruct.  We also reimbursed one member about 4 ships, lost because he kept falling asleep during corp fleets.
---
The corp reimbursement policy I setup:  every member paid 2.5b ISK into the pool.  All ISK earned during corp events went first into the pool, if it was below 2.5b ISK per member, then any ISK was distributed to members.
---
Nobody complained about having to pay 2.5b for no-hassle reimbursement.
---
When the reimbursement program ended, I returned the 2.5b ISK to every member.
---
LOL so essentially "we can do anything u can do"  
---
"come check out how awesome this is! yah 30k dudes. ohh erm yah they dont interact with each other... ohh and yah u cant see all 30k in one space cause u know, servers and fire and melting and stuff...so we sorta limit what u can see cause otherwise bad things happen. but if u move far enough and can see them u can interact with what u see!"  
---
so sorta like if u move through the eve universe and encounter people u can shoot them in space when your close enough to them?  
---
/me facepalms  
---
by their very OWN definition eve IS DU cause when u move close enough to people you'll be able to interact with them and see them. Kinda like u know... jumping into the same system as them from say.. another system.

OH SHIT ONE OF US IS A TRAITOR STATISTICALLY. HOLD ME.
---
I detect sarcasm, but let me be clear your off handed comment would be good for eve, and a win for CCP.  
---
Because saying ridiculous shit, making huge promises, and doing crazier shit is a solid strategy as evidenced by recent IRL politics.
---
I mean - they appear to be more effective than your last deployment?
---
It's probably why you're in this thread thinking that the OP has meaningful point.  It must be hard for you out there, with all the reading the world requires.

Kind of sad fedup left the warzone to become renter's. Hopefully they don't end up like drone walkers

Elo would make me quit the game with his FCing. Coked up gerbils are for fun time, not srs spaceship time
---
someone reads my myspace blog

that sounds interesting

Why not something smaller so there's less of an issue with what you joked about, maybe 10%, so not a ton, but still impactful
---
Jesus your posts are cancer.
---
SLAVER WHORE
---
Yes we are. Thanks!
---
This would indeed be cancerous for the majority of eve, but it's the 1%ers in any game that get the noobies excited about whats possible.   If you all you care about is making everything accessible to everyone go play wow.

Blizzard made that decision in 2012 and have been bleeding players ever since.

---
They have some pretty core things in common like buying and selling with the intent of making a profit in some way. I'm curious though, of that admittedly very small amount of things in common can the experience interacting with one assist in the understanding of the other in some way?
---
Chill dude. Slavery is essential, no need to be salty about it. And I wouldn‚Äôt call the empress of the most powerful empire in the galaxy a whore. 
---
There was a minor Plex sale (10% on *some* packages if memory serves right) back in February. However, that was back around Valentines Day and we did not experience the Plex price hike for some time after that. They have not been as aggressive with the Plex sales so far this year it seems. I highly recommend you ready that Nosy Gamer piece that was linked, it was very well done. 
---
Near2 is a completely good program mmmk
---
They should just add its features into eve!

So Nully, insure wyverns and throw them around = profit

Would this mean that they will be adding Triglavian fighters also though? considering its a new race like amarr and such. i personally would like to see more faction fighters in general. more diversity is always welcomed, just balance them.
---
*BYE
---
lmao you still fucked shit up

Yes, but it was only around 10%, not the 20% we're all used to so we didn't buy.

Hmmm. I wonder if these will become new components for building Trig Dres maybe ?

Someone had to be Wally's first. I hope you were gentle.

&gt;Or, you know, go fight someone that fights back.
---
This gets used a lot as an argument but it's trash. Guess we should blops or smartbomb or gate camp either. Literally has nothing to do with programs like NEAR2 being bad for the game.
---
The sad part about a trig dread is it will be useless in kspace like most faction dreads since your dead when you siege.
---
Could someone fill me in on this? Ive been MIA in EVE drama recently. Gotta get back into the meatgrinder
---
M-m-monstergank!

They are a strong and equal member of legacy, it must be panfam spin that makes you think they exist as a buffer state for the legacy crab lands.
---
Nor do you have the option of shooting PIRAT anywhere but trade hub undocks.
---
aye...and every time you mention changes to siege or changes to citadels to give dreads their siege role back.
---
everyone attacks you screaming "Dreads are fine, learn to dreadbomb" or some variation.
---
People can't help it and get excited
---
Ouch. 
---
It wasn't always this way, I lived in stain in 2005-2010ish and you could jump into most of the north of stain with a capital from Saminer, nowadays you've got just T-NN in JF range.
---
Truth. After EVE, I couldn't stand playing Diablo 3 in anything but Hardcore mode. Kinda killed my game sessions with my friends, since they saw hardcore as an elite e-peen thing. That wasn't it at all. I wasn't trying to get on any leaderboards or anything like that. I just found the assured eventual victory of softcore to be empty. I still played softcore from time to time, for the sake of friendship, but I was always bored, and none of them dared try to join me in HC.
---
Unsurprisingly, they refuse to even touch EVE since "any asshat can come ruin your game any time, and it's completely within the rules". They play your standard fantasy MMO's instead.
---
You're right. But I think there is still a lot of room to go apeshit on it. Like a full on faction line of ships Trig / Amarr, or Trig / Gallente for example.
---
RIIIIIP

\*punches you\* Still dreaming?
---
G R I M D A R K
---
^ Got to agree on this. 
---
It feels like the Trigs are being set up to be what the joke were going to be back in '03. That being a playable faction with its own fully fledged ship line.
---
Despite my opinion of QuickSwipe as a human being, I am grateful for the entertainment you provide this game, regardless of at who's expense.
---
at this point, why not?
---
Talk shit, get hit.
---
Where do I complain ? 
---
Generally you can do three things with PI:
---
1) Extracting planets.  These planets extract P0 and make either P2 or P1.  It is desired to get P2 because volume is smaller and you have to spend less time shipping from your planets.  This is by far the easiest form of PI since you can set your extractors and then just forget about them for a week and then get some decent passive income.
---
2) Factory planets.  These planets make end products that are then usually used elsewhere.  An example is Robotic Parts, which are a component of fuel blocks for citadel's.  You import your components and then set up factories.  You do however have to pay a heafty tax for the import and export.  To really make this profitable you need 6 highsec POCOs with access to Jita.  Owning these POCOs can be really hard if you aren't behind a powerful Corp or Alliance that is willing to bash and protect these structures in highsec.
---
3) A combination of both of these.  This is desirable for remote areas like WH space.  You will have excess lower tier product laying around so you will have to find a way to ship that too.
---
Shows how little you know. 
---
or what? You have to speak up, son!
---
Sure , but why don‚Äôt u just borrow my Tiamat ? 
---
Better yet, have it affect a small bonus that‚Äôs tailored towards small-gang PvP. For instance, local rep strength or speed/lock speed/agility/drone HP/neut amount. Minimal effect in fleets, so no cancerous grinding of standings. 
---
Wait where is stain again?
---
I think they deployed to Hopbib in Aridia recently, but no one really noticed.
---
LSH are Russians, NSH are not.
---
More a belieber.

kinda? it's pretty dead but so is the rest of eve outside of 6 regions, 3 of which are in highsec

We literally cover full regions with campers, so there's no safe harbor without our eyes on it, and then just sit on a bridging blops and wait for the next VNI or carrier to get impatient and risk it.
---
Plus we get to mine bonus salt on r/eve every few days. It's a win/win.

Guristas NPCs did better than Goons, Init and TAPI.
---
I think there is value indeed. It just needs to be more streamlined. I think the CSM should be more like the US Senate rather then the US Congress which it currently is from the point of view of actual process of being elected.
---
The only issue with CSM that I see is that it is predominantly filled by the big NS blocks whose agendas are too often same or similar so they end up misrepresenting the playerbase at large.

And "well you should have voted" will not work here to address this. First it won't work because certain regions simply do not have the player density to bring up their votes and thus end up being not represented, second it won't work because the unorganized players from small corps, HS, etc. do not know where to find the info while in the game and are just often casual in nature enough to not use external stuff.
---
This second group is actually huge and most under represented. Regardless if its small time or casual PvP, or PvE alike. 
---
&gt; First of all - was in like a fortizar or so? Since it took months for a small corp that is good enough to move in a wormhole I would expect a fortizar/tatara/sotiyo ? 
---
Ya, I too would expect a small corp to drop at least an Astrahus and an Athanor, before attempting something larger.
---
Honestly, the cost of rigs for 'something larger' really rules-out sotiyo and tatara for most small corps, so a fortizar more likely.
---
I feel bad Wibla, he really is a good guy
---
For the campers? Cheap ones are just stealth bombers with a cyno (covert and regular) and tackle. They don't need to live long to be effective. Once they have more SP you can stick them in a Loki or Tengu.
---
Why am I upvoting globby
---
Just an fyi, the supplier in TNT for these titans and dreads is Special Tactical Arms Research Labs headed by Capt Viper. I wouldn't burn the bridge but they did it first ;&gt;
---
Wibla likely knows about it. 
---
lol watch rats steal a hel 
---
i hope its somethin industry or i just wasted some dollas lol
---
I mean, we had one guy in NSH 1.0 who could speak some Russian. Granted, he was born in California.

The claims of Russian collusion have been vastly exaggerated.

I‚Äôd be down to fly a suicide bomber! Fly it, press button, explode/instapod while doing a reasonable amount of damage to nearby ships

NC only feeds rags to NPCs thanks
---
bbtb has been consumed with what reddit thinks about GOOONS, check his post history it's sad
---
Yeah I have heard it is a good strategy, new eden should band together to fight the npc menace
---
I have no idea whats going on, new player here.
---
Bait flairs and then explains he's bait flaring. You aren't doing it right bud.

It's been reviving slightly lately (in Black Rise/Placid). It's still a lot of fun, but the people on here are recalling its heyday. For me, that was when Galmil used to have at least 4 active fleets throughout EU/USTZ, not counting whatever RDRAW was up to, and on a good day they'd all find fun fights. Mid-size t1 fleets frequented the area and Snuff, SC and other groups would roam around in HACs and whatnot (whatnot usually involved caps). Everybody still complained that it was hard to find solo fights, complained about the "state" of FW, and whined about Pirates being oppressive etc. etc., but it was still the best place in Eve to get into a quick fight. Home system pushes brought everyone and their mother to lowsec, and Snuff and SC fought over money moons on an almost weekly basis (could be rose-tinting my glasses there though). Now, you kind of have to know where to go for solo/small gang and there's occasional big fights between the groups in the area. Home system pushes, however, are dead. The old pipes where you had to be extremely careful warping around are empty (looking at you hikk-pyne gate), and I haven't seen a t1 cruiser fleet in my area in a long while. Generally though, there's still stuff to do and fights to be had if you know where to look.

Without writing a book, in my years of doing PI first with 1 char and 5 planets, now with 9 chars and 52 planets:
---
Similar to ores, some P1 PI is more valuable than others to extract.
---
If you only want to extract P1's, expect to haul a lot of m3's (which will make extracting the most valueable isk/m3 P1's more important).
---
If you want to get into P2's or P3's again like production some items are worth more to crunch than others.
---
For the least amount of hands on, some planets have both P1's available to make P2's.
---
When I had only 5 planets running P0&gt;P2 planets made sense. As my network scaled up to 50 planets, running extraction planets pulling 2 types of P1's has been the way to go (for higher extraction yields).
---
Lately I run two types of production planets: one that extracts and one that is pure prod.
---
The pure prod planets are what they sound like, the ones that extract some of the P2 inputs however I think are the best bang for the buck so far.
---
Mechanical parts for example the reactive metals P1 is about half the cost of the precious metals P1, so I set my P0&gt;P2 mechanical parts prod planet up to extract and produce precious metals (about 200 units/hr) and the other half of the P1's required I launch/refill about once a week.
---
On timing: I have been leaning more towards 3 day restarts due to the number of characters to keep up with, however I would recommend 36-48hour cycles. At some point too much extraction means not having enough processors.
---
Ask more questions?
---
Also, you might want a spreadsheet, and bookmark fuzzwork.co.uk/pi
---
Says the guy without a flair. Cmon. Even 'Taylor Swift Empire' would work.
---
Yeah gotta be honest I tried that
---
Everyone sucks at rust .. but what my friends and I did was to change to rules .. in rust we start with a bow and push to get an ak by constant pvp less on build base etc .. we got more enjoyment from it that way
---
So with eve make enough isk go sustain your purpose and not make the purpose isk... or sov.. or structure anchoring etc ...
---
Do you think maybe it's because reality doesn't align with the retarded attempts at building your side here?
---
"we did this because of someone else that's separate, even though they say they're not"

Big fuckin thonk

Alternately you can just join us and learn how we do it first hand. I'll share broad stuff that everyone does on reddit but specifics are members only. Just make sure you bring Techtmar with you, we miss the bastard :-)

I have no love for Holesale, but I absolutely adore the fact that 4 months after shedding a river of tears over being turbo-blobbed by mindless nullsec spodbrains, the entirety of C5 space unites against the only group that had the balls to attack HK when they were weak. Never change, j-space!
---
It's much easier to get from 0 to -10 then it is to get from 0 to +5. If they made a pirate version it would have to have a lot less tank bouse or else just login a few alts and smrtbomb there pods in lowsec for like 10mins and easy done.
---
The Prospect is also a popular camper.

I posted Kuzim's name also.  He would camp Skarkon / L4X gate in Molden Heath (I think before he moved to Delve) and demand a 'tax' to travel through the gate, usually metal scraps would work.  He gave me my Skarkon Street Cred.
---
I pretty much stopped playing other games because they are just empty. I can watch a helluva ride of a story of Witcher on youtube, but I can never be same again. EVE hardens. 
---
The Bonus Skillpoint Weekend post states that   
---
" These skillpoints will be able to be applied to any character on the account that receives them."  
---
Does that mean they can be redeemed once per character? Or just once per account?  
---
is there a way, an app, that uses a local dscan to open all zkill character pages of the scan in one go?  
---
or better, something that scans names from local and makes an automated cross-reference search from killboards 
---
or any zkill app for that matter?
---
Just apply this bonus to the gallente blaster boats. :)
---
Who?
---
I've been attacked on undock at jita by goons many times. 
---
Why would I want flair to color perceptions of my posts? I want people to assess my shit posts on its shit merits.

If you are going to bait flair then take your response and downvotes a stroke yourself off silently - properly.

guristas is CTA for NC. KS

WATCH OUT
---
Don‚Äôt do it Lenny!
---
Decent SSD, or even better an NVME should help with that somewhat. 
---
I appreciate your shitpost, however, if dude is traitor I hope I get to shoot a future-not-blue today.
---
but he's not wrong. it isn't a bot, and the OP has showed absolutely 0 interest in learning how it works despite being available to him since he has a blue character.
---
this.
---
i regularly use it to keep on top of my market orders from work.

Having cancer is also factual but doesn't make it any less unbearably awful.

PIRAT Is an Elite PVP group that excells in combat against 1 man ALT corporations in Hi Security space. You know they are really good because they are always in an active war and have an extremely good kill % vs frigates, destroyers cruisers and mining barges. 
---
They dont lose often....except against people who can actually fight back.
---
&gt; I can foresee the issues with this "Preparing for our new doctrine everyone is required to grind angels rep to +10. We're switching to machs in autumn so you got three months." :)))
---
Actually that might be interesting if there were opposing pirate factions. If you lived in the space of one you could fly the ships of the other, as the more the home pirates hate you the opposing pirates like you.
---
Unfortunately I don't think that relationship exists in lore.
---
Ive been in some fleets with fc's that english is their 2nd or 3rd language and this was harder to understand than them.

I accept this behaviour 
---
The only thing I'm butt hurt about is not getting to shoot a blue, if it does happen, which it probably won't
---
Solid build, you will want to upgrade to 32GB of matched ram. No rush but it will help with the 64bit client and running more then 3 clients at once. Every thing else is perfect.
---
700 DPS of usually *very* specific damage types, That you can usually build your tank against since you know what resists the rats in the target region have, and you're shooting at ships that are running a minimum-viable PVE tank.
---
Except I wasn‚Äôt complaining. I‚Äôm pointing out that overwhelming force is not what most people would consider a fight, so a person who is looking for a fight, clearly isn‚Äôt interested in overwhelming odds.
---
If overwhelming odds from the defender is a considered afight, then so is ganking the bears. Based on that, the claim that the roamed ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt actually want to fight‚Äù and ‚Äújust wants soft targets‚Äù are both conflicting arguments.
---
It seems likely that they were made as to not address the actual OP and instead try to imply they somehow don‚Äôt deserve to be in someone else‚Äôs sov because of their intent.
---
Appreciate the effort as always to pull these together.
---
Reward content creators.

If you're in HS, P0 to P1 or P2 if you can.  Setting up factory planets don't really make it worth it.  If  you're in null/wh with a low or zero tax rate, make the highest level items you can.    
---
I have two accounts.  Two "main" toons and 4 lackies that do PI.. IF you keep up with it, you can plex at least one account.    
---
I'll warn you right now, if you start getting into the 15+ planets, you may need to start anti-depressant medication.  It drags hard...

Uhh Woops

Yeah we have a small pond in the back of our garden 
---
That would make sense, mine does!  
---
I prefer loudly announcing whenever I stroke myself off tyvm don't kinkshame me.
---
Just as sad as yours tbh üòÇ
---
i love the dramiel, dont get me wrong. its just all over the place. doesnt have the dps to be a good brawler, doesnt have the powergrid to be a good arty boat, doesn't have the capacitor to be active tanked effectively without cap boosters. i dont know. i know im too biased to offer any REAL suggestions to it, but i dont like that it doesnt really have a niche like the other pirate frigates. 
---
now its bonuses make it so it warps like an interceptor, which, given that role itd make sense for the lackluster dps, but its not nullified.
---
theyd never do it, but giving it interceptor style nullification would at least give it a niche. it wouldnt be chosen over interceptors because it doesnt have the scram/disruptor range bonuses, but it would make for a role it to settle into.
---
either that, or just make the tracking bonus a bit stronger so it applies better at its high speeds, bringing it to suit its implied role. 
---
regardless, i still fly it. dual web is viable in lowsec and dual prop in null, but i dont think it really has a place flying solo with where it is now.
---
There were some minor sov drops due to incompetence (or incompetent/premature betrayal) before the big one went off, but goons only lost Delve "for good" when he actually pushed the button on kicking all the corps.  That was a deliberate "fuck goons" act, how could it be anything else?
---
imagine spending hours and hours and hours every day sitting motionless on a station undock or a gate in a major tradehub in a gatecamping aids setup on your ship and killing mainly mindless new dudes that don't really know any better, and some haulers too, and then acting smug and pretending you're good at the game, only to chimp out and sperg whenever you get dunked on by a bunch of sentient beans in tornados and taloses
---
that's the summary
---
resist profiles work both ways. for example if you're in GSF, your VNIs are gonna be shooting EM. Dudes usually roam in Jags and Wolves in those areas looking for ezfrags. You're a smart ratter so you think to yourself "Well, let me look at the fits they are using" and so you find a standard roaming jag/wolf fit from prominent roamers. You see that both of these ship builds have explosive resists, and do at most ~230 dps. So you just modify your VNI to have a reactive armor hardener, a MAAR, and maybe some small neuts for good measure. You also carry medium explosive drones as your ship has a bonus to drone tracking, HP, dmg, and yield.
---
So when you get tackled, you align out, reset your reactive armor hardener to harden against the damage type they are doing to you (usually explosive since the VNI has an explosive resist), throw your small neuts on em, staggered of course, and unleash your full flight of medium explosive drones. More often than not, you're gonna kill them.
---
I don't think you understand how wrecks on hits u dock work. I doubt horde got it. There are literally people that make it their lives to loot or salvage on hits 4-4

Hahah fair - upvote

**No collusion!**

I thought u couldnt PVP in hisec?  I have much to learn lol

That's a bold statement.

I predict Public Contract will be an item release in the 12 days of Eve this Christmas - get speculating station traders!
---
Because its p&gt;p and not pvp
---
im sure there are plenty of people who know far more than i do ^-^ speaking of, i believe there are subreddits set up specifically for people who might need assistance finding resources to help get them back on their feet. i dont know names, but since you have the internet at your fingertips, im sure you could find a good number of helpful sebreddits to point you in the right direction. i go on r/eatcheapandhealthy to help me not run myself dead just eating fast food.

stuff like that. i really do wish you the best. theres a lot of stuff out there to help you, you just have to take advantage of it (:

I've talked to him a few times and he's a really cool dude. He works really hard and cares about the right things.

Which is good for Bitcoin. 
---
They're elitist shitlords who cry when people even dare to fight them.
---
Sir Molle, I hit dscan for a titan wreck
---
Because they dock up and complain when there's a real fight, or get ganked and spill salt all over the sub. 
---
It's not hate and so much people drinking up the ironic reversal 
---
Thanks!
---
"Borrow" implies I have to give it back. I wanna have one of my own to keep =)
---
It's effect on performance and ease of use would depend on implementation. If it just gets a bonus to number of fighters per squad it'd be fine as they're all treated as one entity
---
Could make it be a stat that doesent impact large fleets.
---
Hyde joined TNT and is making isk by selling off caps and supers to outside groups for cheap.

It would have lived if it were a botting super.

8GB is enough, 16GB is overkill &amp; 32GB is just fucking stupid unless you're going to need it and if you have to ask in the first place, you don't. RAM is coming down in price, 16GB can be had for ¬£90. First gen ryzen, 1600 or 1700 will do just fine if OP wants to save some cash + the cooler that comes with them it really good, even if overclocking. AIO coolers are overrated and often cost double if not more than a standard fan cooler. Performance is roughly the same &amp; both with a custom fan curve can be silent.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Once again, NVMe drives are not something worth buying unless you actually need it. A standard SSD is plenty fast enough and cheaper. Do not buy a dogshite 5400rpm HDD in this day and age.
---
The money he saves from not buying a stupid amount of RAM, from not buying an overprice AIO cooler, from not buying a NVMe drive, can be used to potentially upgrade the GPU, 1660 ti is more than enough to handle a few eve clients.
---
He would yank it due to his having affected the price to the desired amount
---
It triggers me when people declare access modifier for variables but not for functions. 
---
Also python sucks reeeee C# top tier.
---
It's because their flavor of PvP is to go after the lowest of low hanging fruit. Basically, to get the easiest kills possible with the lowest possible amount of risk. They're pretty much the same as the bears they hunt.
---
And because station games are complete cancer.
---
Google shall be my friend! A lot of the BL guys like to make fun of me and say shit to me but one day they told me I was too negative. So, slowly I've been trying to see things positively. Currently my car is fucked and needs a lot of repairs, but I see this as an opportunity to learn how to save better, and be more prepared for emergencies. My relationship with my parents is getting better, and I'm just taking things forward one step at a time. 
---
I seriously can't thank you enough for the kindness and support. It means a lot to me. But I'll still kick your ass in space one of these days, maybe :p
---
Fuckin love this community
---
Not worth the premium. Standard SSD is plenty fast.
---
The problem is that we like shooting each other just as much as we like shooting P I R A T and the likes.
---
16GB is more than enough.
---
Guristas doing more damage than init did during their whole deployment  
---
Someone end this menace!
---
I mean that stuff also happens in sov null, whats the difference?
---
As if there is any risk in any other parts of eve?
---
If you make a 1 man corp in HS, as long as you don't put it in a very in-the-way area you'll be fine.
---
Most wardeccers and professional HS pirates are way too lazy to travel more than 1 or 2 jumps off of the major shipping lanes
---
other than that.... if those are your only two choices, you are really barring yourself from some great parts of the game

---
Ok you got me wh, every other part of space there is no risk.
---
Just because I am not agreeing with the majority im a troll?
---
From my perspective it's not just that they prey on noobs, it's that they act smug/elite about doing it. There isn't anything inherently wrong with killing noobs/people that can't shoot back. It's quite easy and can be a little cathartic. However, I don't try and pretend like I am some elite ultra skilled pvper when I kill a mining barge in a vindi, because there is absolutely no way I could lose the fight. 
---
Apparently that alliance no longer really exists, and its main corporation Adversity. is part of Snuffed Out since 1 January 2019.
---
Eve is full of people doing disgustingly violent things to each other, almost always been in the spirit of the game. We need an out-cast class to project all our repressed guilt on to. Then in righteous fury we attack them to give use the delusion that we are righteous.
---
But that answer is too close to true, so it is because they are evil.
---
I fully support this. Maybe they can have DLC where you can walk in stations. 
---
That makes sense, thanks for contributing
---
Asset safety your stuff to lowsec. Probably the easiest thing to do. 
---
How about FW variants too?
---
A tech 2 racial dictor or heavy dictor with bonus to resists or buffer based on either standings with the NPC FW faction or FW rank?
---
I mean I'm all for an Anti-Marishal, but the major question is how to make it lore friendly when explaining how/why it works. 
---
Concord is easy, the more you're liked by the Space UN the more features they give you on their ships, as expressed by sec status. 
---
Who says they're not? Literally in this thread they say SEADC and HA are the same thing for all intents and purposes.
---
Good vid well done o7 
---
Sov null is the sandbox, high sec is the theme park.
---
The difference is doing it in the Middle East vs Six Flags.
---
The HQ of the wardec has to be player owned.  it can be a POS, a POCO or a Citadel of some kind. If the corp/alliance only owns one structure then when i dies the wars will come to an end in 24 hours.

Afk camp an entire region with 100 alts.

Unfortunately.

They lose their pods for one of three reasons:

1) they're too busy multiboxing
---
2) they're too busy raging

3) they lack a basic understanding of Eve mechanics

I, too, continue to feed attention to people I don't want to post. That's going to stop them, I'm sure.

yeah but for the average line member, na

You also forgot the upcoming T2 command dessie

That‚Äôs what I previously told him, I should of had a look at his post history before even bothering to reply to him.
---
But it‚Äôs not just about CCP, he‚Äôs got the same attitude about everything, crying and bitching in all kinds of subs lol
---
because their targets are typically non pvp enemies.
---
their only threat is the time till concord arrives.
---
PvP implies player vs player.    not player vs non-combatant with a timer.    
---
so when they brag about how "elite" they are.   they don't actually have any skill in PvP.  they just have a high dps cheap ship to pick on people who dont fight back.
---
They return periodically.

Well just have to see how the dust settles...
---
Isn't this the plot twist in The Last Jedi?
---
The amount of ram eve uses will go up with the 64 bit client. He is asking for a future proof build, 32GB would be future proof. Like I said no rush but it is a nice to have.
---
You can be shot at if your corporation is at war with another by individuals in said corporation. You can also get shot by people who don‚Äôt care about dying to Concord immediately afterward. 
---
What happend?
---
well it looks like we did not cry enough since people on reddit who do not play the game anymore won the crying games and now CCP nerf cap, will it save the game ? Nope, will you see more people leaving blob alliance to do smaller stuff ? Ofc not
---
Your advice seems a bit dated. And you seem to have a chip on your shoulder. I thought mining was supposed to be relaxing! :D 
---
8GB was passable 3 years ago, but these days your web browser alone can consume 4+GB. An AIO is quite optional but provides far lower temps for stable overclocking than air, which is nice a few years in when the processor begins to hit its limits. The speed of the HDD doesn't matter much with StoreMI because most reads are from the SSD and all writes go to the SSD first and get moved to the spinning rust in the background.

Risky to post that here bud

Someone is severely underestimating the girth of Goon Doublethink.
---
Fly around in an inty strip everything and repackage and then have a moving corp move it for you.
---
I mean it's not the end of the world and won't kill capitals as the heavy hitters in big alliance operations. Just means we have to be a bit more careful when ratting and doing solo operations.
---
knowing my killboard, you probably will! see you in space, stranger
---
You can‚Äôt go wrong with NC. they are the pioneers of Eve and some of the best pilots in game.
---
Change my mind
---
damn, imagine following someone around on reddit 
---
sad
---
He means he let their toons into the Corp, nothing about sharing. Also ccp doesn't really give a shit about account sharing
---
Ah alright. I‚Äôm new so I was just curious about this 
---
"large"? A 10-man corp could field 10 Talos.
---
Spicy pepe inbound 
---
I‚Äôm in Texas 
---
 I have no idea wtf you are talking about 
---
Yeah all good. The rule on account sharing is basically so CCP doesn't have to deal with one person on an account stealing the other guys stuff or whatever. No one gets banned for account sharing alone. 
---
Last time I checked Google sheets was still working. Do you have issues? üòÅ

I think these ships will always have an important purpose, it's just now going to be more dangerous to use in smaller scales. I wouldnt call it the end of an era, maybe just rough times for us.
---
And it is super fustrating to spend years training capital skills to then be nerfed as soon as your skilled up.
---
Ok good to know. I ran across something earlier, can you tell me if it's true? Are there bounty hunter corporations? Thx for info guys.
---
He's talking about letting their chars into corp, not account sharing.
---
Heretic gets an inherent Armor resist bonus. So it doesn't need the extra Low.
---
Oh cool, so if ships are tweaked at all you throw out months worth of grinding potentially so you can shift with the meta? Not to mention that if they got bonuses *in addition* to what they already have, pirate and navy faction ships will become even more cemented as mandatory and not advisable.
---
There is not a good system that this can be slipped in under without gimping the ships substantially and making up for it with the standing skills and opens up a new can of worms. Should piloting standard t1 ships/t2 ships also be affected by the faction standing that they are made from? If not, why?
---
It's a cool idea but it lacks any sort of decent implementation scheme that could work within the confines of the game as it is right now.
---
Hello Hunter its your director, please stop posting we can't handle this amount of bad posts in our corporation. Thank you
---
Wow. I don‚Äôt even know how to read that. 
---
^^HEYYYY ^HEYYYY HEYYYYYYY!!!!!!
---
Maybe in nullsec, but if you can't get fights unless there's people around, wouldn't it stand to reason NOT to evict someone for the chance of future fights?
---
Exactly the reasons they made the changes! No more boring invincibility and I welcome it.   
---
Do wish I could be there for the moment that first bubble goes up, post balance pass, as you lose the first of many ratting supers - I am sure most of us playing the game would call the expression on your face 'enjoyment'! 
---
Write a bot that has a hidden timer running. When this timer hits zero, all Rorqs/supers/VNI's/carriers run by it flock to one system, where they gather at a spot and collectively self destruct. How hard could it be to hide code for an extended period of time of let's say 3 years?
---
bear witness on this heathens burned eyes. He has committed atrocities against purity and the lord has taken his cognitive ability.
---
Take note he stays in large alliances to do PVP, for his brain does not function like the pure.
---
This war is just begun!
---
I just destroyed anything of low value to clear the UI and courier contract the rest to Jita.
---
Wow dont make texas come for u
---
90KM IS ALL I ASKED FOR
---
I will just be amaze how some of the most vocal about this start by "I did not play eve since 3 years" or "Im currently in a break but here is what is wrong with eve"
---
I mean I recently get my self into more small scale pvp, solo and small gang, So far I did not see a single super/carrier/titan droping on me...
---
Dont worry about it just load ur guns its happening 
---
From talking to my WH buddies, I know you guys are super excited for this change. There is going to be a lot of exciting content for you guys. I'm looking forward to seeing the KMs! Hopefully I'm not on them :P hahah
---
I support the Texans, I do not support Hunter Roy being main poster for your cause
---
Excuse me, NC is a wealthy space guild.
---
We eat medium-rare steaks, except for the vegetarians who eat exotic types of kale.
---
Been skilling into caps for years, useless now. Think I‚Äôll just rmt my accounts and be done with it 
---
Mate, your spodbrain is getting embarrassing - most people in blob alliances want to kill caps, not be amoebic miners/ ratters. Your kind was on the rise because of the imbalance of caps, it encouraged boring playstyles, which encouraged boring players (See exhibit OP) - now you boring risk averse whales will be easier to catch and kill, and maybe some of the people who made the game interesting will come back.
---
Don't go nuclear dude, I'm on same page. Just fly safe, with a good corp and alliance and you should be all right.
---
Cracks forming!
---
I mean that's Reddit. That's why ccps try to direct input to the forums. Odds are if your not playing, your probably not going to log in the forums.
---
This is a pretty damn good analogy
---
I keep my EOTWAWKI kit on stnad by for just such an occasion. Send meet up location to my beeper
---
I'm not boring &gt;_&gt; uhhh errr.... Your boring
---
\*you're
---
;)
---
Triglavian drones and fighters are in our future.
---
imagine spending hours and hours and hours every day sitting motionless in a anomaly or a gate in a major krabhub in a gatecamping aids setup on your ship and killing mainly mindless roamers that don't really know any better, and some rolling haulers too, and then acting smug and pretending you're good at the game, only to chimp out and sperg whenever you get dunked on by anyone you don't outnumber 5:1
---
Me 'scuse!
---
Guild space wealth is for not NC.
---
Rare-medium steaks for eating are not.  Shame is to vegetable eaters who kale take from plate shovel and mouth into.
---
Expect fully pockets of hot and bars for Kirkland to belonging for NC after meme 'cycled of "public contract" occurring is.
---
Failscade NC of is imminent.

+5000% npc bounties while at -10

go to CCP's HQ.   and walk.
---
no other way
---
Yeah Null Sec ... I don't know anything
---
So just to be clear, YOU started a conversation YOU didn't want to have.. 
---
Yes. Burn B0T.
---
cringe and tapipilled
---
PLEX PRICEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSS
---
Eh, just forgot that we were talking about blops.
---
Jesus 
---
Yeah I haven‚Äôt roamed in brave space before(was in test for the last 6 months) but I 100% what you mean. When you‚Äôre krabbing you don‚Äôt wanna die and so whatever can possibly be done to minimise content is acceptable, so if that means dropping supers on anything bigger than a corvette(and pretty much everyone does this) then that‚Äôs what people are going to do.
---
If you ever do small roaming you‚Äôll see the other side if it, it‚Äôs so damn hard to get a fight out of anyone. I don‚Äôt want to hunt vnis, I wanna fight a 20 man response fleet with my 5 man group and see how much we can get done, and when we die(I always die lol) I‚Äôll probably reimburse any of the cheaper ships like 5 times over for the enemy, give me gf and head off.
---
Also if you hate vni ratting for the love of god try something else, so abyss t2/t3 or do scanning or salvage behind a super in impass. All of those things will make more money than vni ratting (salvaging is an easy 100m an hour, which will buy you like 8 t1 caracals) Or salvage and loot after fights. Vni ratting is honestly one of the worst incomes in nullsec and is only good for multi accounts, I used 6 when I did it, and even then I‚Äôd only lose like 2 ships a week while being completely afk for resetting sites.
---
I think to make my point better cause I feel we agree on parts here. I don‚Äôt want to fight you in your vni, I wanna fight you and your friends in pvp ships that have a good chance of beating me and my friends, but aren‚Äôt impossible for us to fight back against. That‚Äôs literally it, I don‚Äôt want free kills, and I don‚Äôt want to get turbodunked by more capitals than we brought in cruisers, just something in the middle that‚Äôs fun for everyone lol.
---
Can't do that anymore :(
---
What does that even mean? You censor corp members? 
---
Lol k dude 
---
Can't help but think of The Loophole:

---
No I just wish he would make good posts :(
---
This is good for the game. Certainly good for newer players and newer corps/alliances that now might actually have a chance instead of getting deathstacked into the ground. So quit whining.
---
Be a better leader and stop blaming others because your corp is shit a posting. 
---
Yeeeeee fuck em right ccp
---
If you add me to your top 8, I will put you at #2 above Tom on my top 8
---
No, I think I pointed out how stupid you are being. You keep being stupid. That's it.
---
If that is a "conversation" in your world that's fine, but I don't suffer fools forever. 
---
Contract it to me. I'll consolidate it.
---
honestly most of my money is in assets i have about 800m in isk but 14.5b in assets. I Have been flying solo for a long time so im really looking to consolidate and then liquidate. Before looking for a corp to join.
---
Get a life dork.
---
we actually just huff superglue
---
&gt; How to beat Intel bots?
---
Use AMD bots?
---
yea what he said
---
Do new players get upset when their small gang gets whelped when flying in a null under a capital umbrella?
---
I think there are plenty of places that new players/corps/alliances can set up shop and not have to worry about getting desthstacked. 
---
And if I lose my cap to a handful of new players, I think I would deserve it lol
---
If you don't care about continuing to personally own these assets, selling them via public contract is a good choice. Use right click -&gt; view contents + evepraisal.com, or, for bulk stacks, contract it to yourself &amp; evepraisal the contract. List it on public for a % of jita buy. 
---
If you don't know how to price stuff or want it gone fast, PM me on reddit, I can buy all your stuff at a decent price. 
---
What this all About.

What kind of recon would a trig recon be? Honestly the thought of a curse that can ramp to 800 dps scares me on a spiritual level.
---
Dude, is it even possible for you to suck his cock more? Don't neglect the balls.
---
Bye
---
Spoken like someone who has only flown capitals while they've been broken. Lots of interesting and fun ways to use capitals, but if your fun hinges on having a ship that's just better than everything else to win, yeah I guess you're gonna be upset. 
---
7/5 shitpost, upvoted. 
---
"You're shit so I can't be shit" 
---
Maybe some sort of bizarre meme where bombs deal damage over time that increases the longer you're in it? Or maybe some equally strange shit like bombs that drop the storm effects from abyssal space on a fleet temporarily? God that sounds turbo cheese.
---
That's probably accurate, and imo that's a good thing. Subs are completely eclipsed by capitals right now, to the point that they're nearly useless.
---
Subcaps are more fun. Change my mind.
---
8GB is passable now, and no AIO do not provide much lower temps. Might be a few degrees in it but nothing that warrants the 2-3x price increase over a fan cooler. Admittedly, I've never looked into StoreMI, so can't comment on that.
---
damm, i had too much faith in humanity
---
No such thing as a future proof build. 2080ti's in SLI would be nice to have but it's completely unnecessary.
---
PushX everything to Jita

Tips:
---
- Don't do PI in highsec, get out to like syndicate or some other accessible Null area. Typically, you'll get very low taxes and the planets are better.
---
- You need a Jump Freighter, otherwise you better be right next to highsec.
---
- Use Epithals, they will die to bubbles occasionally but are cheap and you can unload onto a poco if you get caught so you don't lose anything hardly ever.
---
- As for setups, I recommend you do P1-P2-P1-P2-P1 setup if you have lvl 4 skills. That means you do a valuable P1 on planet 1 then you load that on to the next planet to make P2.
---
- There's a lot of money in P4s but I would only get into that if you intend to scale lots of planets.
---
INIT batphones...npcs?
---
omw
---
Meh, every time I've lost a capital (execpt once) has been to subcap gangs. I think this maybe true for the large scale operations, but I don't think that statement is true.
---
Subcap fights are def more fun. I take many more risks in a 50mil frig that I would my super lol.
---
That's kinda the point... they already have one.
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Tiamat
---
But it's a trophy ship. So if they're going to make a full line of Trig ships, they either need to make another, or make this one available for everyone instead of just 50 for the winners.
---
Because high-sec "PvP" is the equivalent to taking a baseball bat and beating on a defenseless homeless person that has no idea what's going on. Where is the glory and honor in that?
