I'm sorry the current null meta of sitting under hundreds of supers while people mine ridiculous amounts of isk/ore with zero risk is stale, not fun, and disengaging. 
---

---
I'm sorry this change effects that style of play but you shouldn't be able to do that. Null should be dangerous and personally I don't think permanent residence should be possible with out a large price being paid. This moves eve towards that. 
---
I disagree with your sentiments but appreciate your time to post this thanks.
---
---
---
Nope, not going to entice me to login. I will continue my login blackout until local is restored. Sorry CCP, try again.
---
GF everybody! No salt from us.
---
I wrote a more detailed AAR here: https://no-vacancies.space/forum/d/346-public-aar-vehement-loss-in-home for those that are interested.
---
Hawks was probably able to tell that we were quite chaotic, but still props for dropping 3 dreads into our home.
---
Remember kids, when you drop your caps, the boogiemen might just be around the corner!
---
Man I hate to admit this but the krabs might be right.  There are only 16k on right now, that is about 4,000 fewer pilots that I am accustomed to seeing at this hour, that can’t be all bots gone, this blackout might prove to be an iceberg.
---
Yeah, definitely. And with alpha you can even do it for free.
---
Like another game, for those hyper carebears that pump tons of money into their activites.
---
But if they're Australian, they're upside-down too so it's still upvotes

imo they should only restrict cyno use to blop BS bridging so you kill two birds with one stone:

1. opens up supply lines that create content
---
2. makes blops battleships actually useful

LZHX opened our new static, and see Nags on scan. We combat them, and get eyes, see they are shooting MCAV. We rage form heavy shield, and get tackle on the nags. The fight goes on like this for a bit with nothing really happening. Our dudes were getting their caps fueled up while we were forming, so they were sitting on our static waiting for the call. Jump the phoenix and 1 nag in, expecting the wh to close.. Only crit. We had a decent amount of logi, and we had been holding fairly well, So we jumped in a 3rd dread, instead of our newly omega'd triage. two hostile nags are down by the time our 3 dread lands on grid. We kill the 3rd hostile nag, followed by the phoenixii, then a nice little finish with the vehement. With all of the caps dead, and tdsin and mcav being in the wrong ships to fight command ships they all went home. the end.
---
navy brutix with rails isn't a terrible option, but better with 1 other person imo
---
Okey, so lets play this out.
---
HS has the highest pop in the game, majority lives there. CCP numbers way back, dont remember. They wouldnt be affected negatively by no local, in fact those numbers have prob gone up.
---
NS has maybe what, 30-40% of the games pop. So out of that 4k drop during saturday primetime you are suggesting that its all bots. 32 ish players former primetime which gives NS a pop of 12800 active residents. A 4k drop means 31,25% bots.
---
And this is without taking into account that Im telling you that bots changed activities in NS towards explo and that HS has prob recevied an uptick. Something that could explain why the newborn numbers have gone up the last week. Something Im certain we see every time bots get mass banned. And yes I know, many players have returned but exactly, returned. They most likely already had accounts so wouldnt make sense that they are creating the uptick. But I dunno so I will leave it at that.
---
But, you are assuming, even without taking the above into account, that bots give a shit for one and stop doing their thing and that NS consists of 31,25% bots. Are these, in your mind reasonable assumptions? Because the largest pops in NS belong to the bigger groups, and regardless of the rhetoric its hard to actually bot in those places. And the numbers in the renting space where bots frequent are not high enough for 31,25%.
---
Besides, the bots were online. The died but they kept going out in pods. They were still logged on you see.
---
So this entire thing about player count drop being bots is well, wrong. Are there bots amongst those numbers, surely is. Are they the majority of the drop, Im fairly certain they arent.
---
I have spoken to many people that straight up say, they wpuld rather the game die than it be too safe in null. Is this really what people want?
---
v0v
---
i got instalocked and 1 shot by a sansha incursion rat in my brand new stealth bomber.... that was fun i guess
---
&gt; Please, for everyone's safety, do not attempt to operate heavy machinery.
---
Since frigates are a large portion of Paris in size, then we look at titans, I'd *really* be interested in discussing your definition of "heavy machinery" is. 
---
Like, are we talking Death Star here? Because that didn't go over so well for IG-88
---
toxic
---
Make a Corp known for always accepting 1v1. Anyone who declines is kicked.
---
Or 2v2 etc. Would get great at pvp fast and would always have fights as anyone who is bored could ask for one, and as long as you have the online members you must do it as per your code of conduct
---
Supply and demand at work.
---
CCP dev spotted ;)
---
&gt;Since frigates are a large portion of Paris
---
Actually, the Rifter is only about the size of a 747.
---
Or just stay an angry nerd, that is cool too my man. Get down with your bad self.
---
According to eve offline the one month average for this time of day is around 20k.  Test and winterco just finished a bilateral cta over a Fort in their war so I’m not surprised it’s not as low as yesterday.
---
How do you pay for hulls?
---
fight wasn't really worth noting about, not much died really.
---
Biggest thing to note was someone in frat breaking the EULA to crash seddow.
---
Hey when vily says cta it’s a cta
---
This is perfect. The more you look at it the better it gets. I am Red to Hot Pockets
---
Standard gates and cynos are what make WH more dangerous; you can be caught on the wrong side, you can roll someone out, but the same can be done to you, and there is no calling the cavalry to help you.
---
That's ofc my own opinon, feel free to think differently, without local now NS is way more dangerous than before, so you have the benefit of the doubt if you claim that to you it is more dangerous.
---
How about a solo fax tanking for 30 minutes against 14 bhaals and 3 leshaks?
---
Maybe cause they had fun?  Fucking shocking I know.
---
:surprised pikachu:
---
I guess. I work 40+ hours a week. I look forward to spending my weekend spinning my ship in Jita all weekend.
---
AAR?
---
&gt; I suspect the people you are running off are the "easy meat" that is the primary reason that a lot of "PvPers" like to play.
---
They like to beat their meat.
---
Have an upvote and gtfo.
---
Faxes need to be easier to kill for sure, I'm just talking about a solo unsupported dreadnaught
---
ISK is there to be spent and exploded. Nice to see people dropping just coz they want to play with things.
---
Fodder for the engine.
---
Terrible troll, scouts on gate have been reporting red traffic all along.
---
What? Did he get ddosed or something?
---
Another casualty to the Blackout. When will CCP end this madness?
---
The capsuleer with a bad computer xD
---
This is eve, so it might actually be true
---
If so, wich Corp?
---
Oh yes, don't even get me started on the riskless nature of asset safety. But hey, at least now you can use it when hunting too, thanks to the changes they implemented to stop the courrier contract to citadel scams: approach citadel (regardless of docking rights), open the "dropbox, deposit the loot you got from killin people who own the citadel you're practically on, go back to empire, pay a small fee and teleport all your loot to sell, lol.
---
It's just an example of a mechanic that is more or less balanced (it works both in favor of attackers and defenders), but that doesn't necessarily make it a good mechanic.
---
Overall, like i said, i'm just spitballing and throwing out ideas, some will be good and some will be impractical. I've been away for long enough that i don't know all the exact minutiae of sov warfare anymore, but getting the ball rolling and getting you guys with more recent experience in the mechanics providing feedback and ideas is what i was going for mostly. Thanks for your input.
---
Haha yeah. I like this. Maybe like a gladiators arena. A system where we all hang out and 1v1 any challengers. We can even have a spectator section and gladiator bets! I like it! People can shoot off fireworks and toss isk to the winner.
---
I have a cigar club called just the tip
---
I dont know. There are people way better at this game than me and they should respond to this. But in my mind, Eve is a game in which everything can be countered. There is a way if you get what I mean, alot of the time people mess up and thats that, gfs in local and learn from it and get better.
---
No local whilst having cloaky and d-scan immune ships means that for instance, excavators can get bombed without any counter. You can travel into a heavy mining system with a t3c with interdiction fit and camp that system for one TZ. Then light a covert cyno, bring in enough bombers to get the job done and kill all the excavs in that system. Without any risk to the bombers and minimal risk for the dropper. 
---
There is no counter atm, local used to be the only counter to it. There are other things as well as log off traps in general and such which practially makes NS a lootpinata now. Its simply gone too far. It feels like we are in HS and CCP has removed Concord and CODE are doing whatever the fuck they want.
---
So I honestly dont think that any iteration of no local would work without having to change other things that actually work as intented, as bombers for instance. Which would be bad so I dont belive in no local in general. I belive we need real changes, not gimmicky ones but to actually fix the underlying issues.
---
You know, the real reason why Im against no local, or rather how I know its bad are all these "good job CCP" posts we are seeing. You will only see this much of a positive feedback if you have utterly raped the other side, like beyond any reasonable amount. Any good solution would have left a bitter taste in the mouths of both sides with both crying for more but having to compromise to less. Those solutions are always the best, when all sides feel fked.
---
This is coming from a fuzzy memory of a 15-year player who spent most of his game life living in southern nullsec. This is overly simplified but please interject and correct me. Those years were such a blast... well except tower spam but I would take that over the citadels these days.
---
Anyway...
---
The Original Atlas at one point held something like Omist, Detroid, Tenerifis, Insmother, and portions of Wicked Creek. Part of Wicked Creek was also owned by Gentleman's Club.
---
Our friends and neighbours where AAA who held Catch, Impass, most of Tenerifis. 
---
Immensea was held by Initiative at that time, something in my mind makes me think that was their first nullsec SOV.
---
Red.Overlord held Feythabolis and a very small portion of Tenerifis.
---
The rest of the south was owned by a small group of Alliances including Coven, Systematic Chaos (?), and a few others.
---
When the anom patch came out that made every system like a -1.0 was when AAA and Atlas teamed up to take Provi and the first Provi Fight Club was birthed. Evoke the way down, I remember NC. have some starting action there, and few others during that period including Circle of Two.
---
For the OP, Here is a good representation of the SOV action since Verite started mapping daily SOV action
---

Especially these days

Literally not affecting me. What are you a thirdgrader, throwing insults to get a response? Its supercute that you actually think it will trigger anyone older than 15. But it does explain your way of thinking. Hmm never mind.

coordinated effort with like a hundred people trying to convo him at once.

&gt;Xenuria wins.

My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
---
Nyyyaa~~
---
To be fair, JFs are partly responsible for the current state of nullsec. They made space small. You can ship enormous ammounts of stuff from high to null, with very little risk. 
---
No Jfs on low would mean alliances would have to either split up logistical work into DSTs, or form up to defend caravans. 
---
And defended caravans would be amazing content creating machines.

The following story is a depiction of real events that happened to me in my first month of playing Eve online ever, it appears that I joined the game at an interesting time, but as you will soon read, I too, paid the price of the blackout :P
---
This is the tale of a newbro who randomly started playing at what appears to be a moment of choice in the past few years of Eve history, the time of what would be known as ''The Blackout'', a dark era of nullsec violence and brutality never before seen. After contemplating the game for so long, the arrival of alpha clones finally convinced him to dive into the rabbit hole, unaware of incoming danger.
---
At first, the newbro was lost in the overwhelming depth of the game, some helpful people gave him tips of what to do, and so he started by doing the career agents and tutorial. Then came a tipping point when his long time Steam friend that he met playing Space Engineer years ago, Slader Harkeness, who also happens to have 6k+ hours of eve online, noticed that the newbro was playing Eve. At that moment, on his 3rd day of playing eve online, the newbro was invited to join a wormholer corporation, a place of great danger where you either learn or die. The newbro, Julius Mordan of his real name, got an imicus and started exploring the wormhole chain, familiarizing himself with tripwire and other tools. On his very first day of exploring, Julius struck gold, finding the rare ''Silent Battleground'' site that contained over 100 mil isk. The newbro's D-Scan finger was hurting, but he was happy.
---
The tale of the newbro kept on going, to the point where he purchased one month of omega and got himself a nice Astero that he named ''Dreamstrider''. He heard rumors of Sansha relic sites and intact armor plates coming from Stain, so he decided to head there, still ignorant of the storm that was about to be unleashed on the nullsec space in the coming hours. Julius was exploring Stain systems, feeling safe when there was nobody showing in local chat. Arriving at a Sansha monument site, he do his thing and scan the crates, one of them is worth 100 mil! Wow he thinks to himself, what a lucky strike! He then moves over to the crate, still seeing nobody in local. Suddenly, a Nemesis and a Sabre uncloak just a few kilometers away from him. It was the end of the Dreamstrider but the dream really has just begun. This was the story of Julius Mordan, a newbro who didn't know about the incoming blackout and felt too safe. He should have known better.
---
Thank you for your attention and have a nice day!
---
MCAV tries friendly smallgang.
---
Novac immidiatley violates them with massive logi blobbing and rapiers.
---
After the very good mcav pilots still manage to win, novac resorts to the only thing they know: Cap Blob. Ex shekel members start trembling.
---
Heroic Hawks come in to purge the dirty blobbers on their own turf and send them back to their pitiful non-keepstar.
---
Justice is served once again, against the most cancerous group of W-Space.
---
Jokes aside though, I thought the nanogang was fun and fair.
---
Only because i've been away from sov mechanics for quite a while. I didn't want to comment in detail and suggest specific numbers for something i'm not deeply knowledgeable on, so i limited my critique to the broad strokes really. Talking specifics is what i hope the rest of the people here can do, since they probably have more recent experience with all of this stuff. To tell you the truth, i was thinking of "targeting" cynos directly, but i thought maybe it would be too much. If you think it would achieve some of what i describe in the original post, then i'd be all for changes to jump mechanics (range, fatigue, cynos, etc).
---
I remember back in the day alliances used to actually make freighter ops, entire convoys with escorts and what not. I don't know if people would find it boring or not, but the instantaneous teleportation we have right now is not good either, it's doing away with any notion of supply lines and their vulnerability.
---
🙃
---
thanks for the help, good bot.
---
Where are you getting your data?  
---
Got any proofs?
---
Manufacture them your self !
---
Yea but Evil Thug was one of the main hearts of AAA. That FC with them amazing soundboard though, he was gold for them for a while after.
---
Well, i did hit the character limit :p
---
On a more serious note, i don't want to suggest hard numbers and specific values because it's an area of the game that i'm not 100% mechanically in the know of after so many years. I know and understand the big picture, but i don't know the exact numbers under the hood, so i wouldn't be able to propose exact tweaks to those numbers. That's what i hope the rest of you guys can help with during this discussion.
---
Tank had tetrodotoxin armour hardeners fit.

Yes

The small fleet reached the stargate without any problem, the spacelines of lowsec where almost empty and rumors of destruction and chaos in the outer regions flooded every known communications channel. That's where this small group of pirates was heading, leaving their usual area of operations to get a glimpse of what was going on behind the veil of darkness.
---
The Fleet Commander was calm and guided his men and women as best as he could, after all, getting a group of lonely sociopaths to not only work together but to do so following orders was already an achievement on itself. But of course he wanted more, he had rallied his troops with the promise of blood and loot and was more than eager to keep his promise.
---
All the jokes and small talk going on in comms suddenly stopped when the fleet made the last jump into Null Security space, and everybody focused on doing their job. An Astero and most of the bombers dispersed and started scanning the system, while a lone Sabre and two Recon ships stayed closed to the gate in order to catch any newcomer, and the designated scout jumped to next system in their route to the heart of Fountain.
---
The scene repeated itself in every system, everyone getting better and faster at their job as time passed; all of them were more used to the quick dogfights that usually happen around their home system, but some had roamed the outer regions in the past and quickly started to remember their old ways. Not much happened in the first part of the journey, but as they were reaching their first destination their scout made a call.
---
\*- "Check, check... I have four Ravens and a couple of Command Destroyers on D-Scan, I think they are comming our way...\*
---
\*- "Everybody jump, everybody jump and hold cloak! Let's see what's comming!"\* - the FC called as he jumped himself into the unknown threat.
---
Only seconds passed as the first D-Scan result came in... some more Ravens now showed up, and as the first battleship landed on the gate more and more ships apeared on the pirate's scanners. The incoming fleet far exceeded what the dozen or so pirates could kill, so the order was given to warp to the next system and continue the hunt. Just in case, an interdiction bubble was left behind as the last ship jumped out.
---
The Initiative pilots, whose region the pirates were roaming around, surprisingly decided not to follow them, but to the ragtag group of killers that wasn't entirely good news... they were probably heading some place else to also dive in the chaos generated since the communications blackout, but their presence in the area was now surely known. The consecuences were evident soon, as they saw an Erebus undocked and thethered to a citadel near one of the gates down the path, soon joined by a Ragnarok.
---
The way back home was about to get closed and the pilots knew it, but they had never expected to come back with their ships to begin with, so they all laughed and moved on.
---
A few more system down the path they managed to get their first kill, a (Svipul)\[[https://zkillboard.com/kill/77793959/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77793959/)*)\] class destroyer that died after thinking he had managed to elude the Sabre's bubble, only to find the rest of the gang waiting for him on the other side, where another interdiction bubble had been conveniently placed by the Sabre... mistake on his part or mysterious premonition, noone knew for sure, but knowing the pilot most of the pirates betted on the second.
---
The time then traveled as fast as the scout ahead of the fleet, while the small fleet cleared system after system in quick sucesion, trying to find a prey to saciate their bloodlust to no avail... until that faithful unscouted jump. The scout had been sent to a dead end system not far from the main fleet to see what was going on, while the rest of the fleet waited on a gate, with hopes of runing into some traveler unaware of their presence in the area.
---
That's why when the Sabre landed on the gate and jumped, everyone rushed behind him... only to find themselves trapped in a bubble on the other side, with a Revenant Supercarrier with its fighters deployed waiting for them. Most people would have turned tail and run, but this pirates were not normal people... they were far more suicidal, to a point someone might even call them stupid.
---
They first targeted the enemy (Sabre)\[[https://zkillboard.com/kill/77795274/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77795274/)\], because they were obviously not going to let the bait live another second, but when the small ship finally blew up they saw the (Lachesis)\[[https://zkillboard.com/kill/77795282/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77795282/)\] of their Fleet Commander go up in flames, soom followed by (one of the bombers)\[ [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77795283/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77795283/)*)\]. They might have all died there, but the shout of their FC (who had regained conciousness in a new clone) made them come back to reality and check their directional scanners, where more and more enemy ships started to pop, like small drops of blood in an already red sea: - \*Warp away and cloak, warp away and cloak!\*
---
So there they were, beaten but not defeated, in enemy space and now in the position of the prey, feeling how the trap slowly but surely closed around them in the absolute darkness. New orders where promptly given, and each pilot rushed to leave the system, scattering the fleet around the constelation just one step ahead of their hunters.
---
Luckily for them, they were far better at flying on their own than following orders or keeping any kind of fleet discipline, so not long after the surviving members of the group gathered in some unnamed system (\*because fuck me if I remember the names of NS systems\*) and started their long way home.
---
At one point on their way back the pilot of the Sabre went more suicidal than usual and decided to attack a Nereus that was floating near a Pharolux Cynosural Beacon right in front of a Keepstar near a gate... somehow he managed to kill (the ship)\[ [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77795954/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77795954/)\] and leave without any reaction from the locals, so they continued their journey together laughing and feeling more and more secure as they approached their known playgrounds in the Low Security regions of New Eden.
---
They weren't.
---
As soon as the first ship jumped into the F7C-H0 system they realized their mistake. A bubbled gate and a dozen or more ships with various banners where waiting for them there (or well, they were waiting for someone at least). A couple of bombers tryed to use their cloaking devices to escape, but to no avail, so when the Sabre pilot landed on the gate everyone asked what he was doing. The answer came as the ship vanished through the gate: \* -"Fuck it, I'm not traveling all the way back, this is I we came here with a clean clone!"\*
---
One after the other the pirates took the gate to their deaths, their fragile ships that took advantage of their covert ops capabilities and where designed to damage big and slow targets where no match to the different combat ships waiting on the other side. (One by the one they exploded)\[\], bringing some light, even for an instant, to the dark emptiness of space.
---
As the pilots regained their conciousness in their new bodies, they started to evaluate what had happened out there in this new reality, each of them silently assesing the mistakes they made -both individually and as a group- on that journey to the now blackened outer regions of New Eden. The silence was broken by the deep voice of their leader, the one man who after many years had somehow managed to mold that merry band of sociopaths into a close group of friends... 
---
\* -"That was fun, we should do it again soon!\*
---
The comms erupted in laughter, as each of the pilots boarded one of their ships and headed out into space on it's own, ready to haunt the spacelanes of lowsec again, knowing full well that they would soon head back into the unkown, to kill and die and laugh in the chaos.
---
Few simple questions.
---
How can I quickly see how strong enemies are compared to me, in pve?
---
Are all sites in wormhole areas guarded by npc's? Got killed in my first wormhole attempt by some sentry of some sort. Instakilled actually. I want to get back in there but if I'll do that or not depends... 
---
Is the only reason high sec areas are safer is because most people are in low sec? You'll die as fast in high sec as in low sec when you're far from security anyway. Or is it related to standing with the law?
---
That's all for now, have a great day!
---
&gt; But it's too late for that now obviously. Hindsight is 20/20 and all that
---
Not really hindsight when everyone told CCP what would happen.
---
But CCP wanted players to build 'villages' in space with multiple structures, minus the current sprawl.
---
I'm just worry PVE boy run away from this change and PVP boy run away from the lack of pvp..
---
hell yeah brother
---
I support these tears.
---
19000 used to be the USTZ minimum its been 2000-3000 lower every day since black out.
---
[deleted]
---
You talk about this as if it's the first time CCP has ever shifted the risk/reward balance in Eve. The difference is, usually its shifted in the direction of more reward for less risk, and now you seem upset that its (for once) moved in the other direction.
---
Working backwards...
---
Tenebrex Cynojammers are far superior to the POS alternative; with the instant activation and redundancy allowing a sov null alliance near immunity to dread bombs.
---
Ansiblex jump bridges severely harmed gate camps' ability to disrupt the flow of travel in sov null. With POS jump bridges this incurred jump fatigue, and there was no damage cap.
---
Moon mining rework pretty much abolished the nomadic lifestyle and was a direct and clear nerf to pure PvP groups. It also seriously hurt content in lowsec which previously revolved around those moon contests.
---
Rorquals becoming a mining ship with a 6 minute (!!) invulnerability window made one avenue for economic disruption nearly impossible for a guerilla group, and mineral proliferation stemming from that fuelled supercap umbrellas which took away another.
---
Perch citadels (never possible with POS) allow people invulnerability on grid with the gate. With a traditional perch I could at least probe you in it and save it in case you went back to it, hoping to kill you.
---
Skill injectors are a buff to parallelization, and where it is definitely possible for skilled PvPers to multibox, this primarily benefits people multiboxing PvE which requires far less APM and brainpower.
---
Need I go on? Pro-PvE changes happened constantly for years, utterly abolishing any viable medium to large scale playstyle except mass krabbing in sov null, and then one change in the other direction and you're crying about it.
---
HTFU.
---
Imagine being in the largest coalition in the game and being too afraid to go to hi-sec instead of fleeting up and doing what you want.
---
My thoughts exactly, zero sense in that title. Interesting fish gif though
---
Oh I read this after answering the other post. Hmm, like I said in that post, a very large portion of my issue is not the mitigation but rather the lack of it, e.g., the bomber issue.
---
And the chore aspect, well. Gatecamps are utterly boring. It wont get upheld. And being defensive will make it harder to be offensive which means that all but crucial warfare will slow down. And there are a lot of chores already with keeping sov, adms, fueling, defensefleets and so on. Not saying that we cant take on more but atleast in a way that people can enjoy it. Ive only met a handful of people in the game that actually enjoy gatecamping and thats because they lack options. People would much rather fight wars than to just sit and hope that someone might crash their gate. It might be fun this early on but when those roamers grow tired and come less and less the gatecampers will stop doing it. This goes for all the other stuff aswell that no local will force. And this without the rewards that usually follow a major change like this.
---
Summary, NS has a lot of disadvantages and this adds to them without giving anything back. At some point you just break the scales and I belive this, in a permanent form, will do just that. People will behave as people, when the balance is off they will try to readjust it and many will do so by leaving NS to places with better balance. Or maybe some have already tried everywhere else and realised NS was the place for them but no longer. Those will leave the game.
---
In conclusion, if people just stop doing what they did and start leaving, then it doesnt matter who was right or who was wrong. What the spirit of Eve was and if NS should be the most dangerous zone. (And the thing is, NS is very dangerous, but players have chosen, without compromising the rules of the game, to make it safer. And are now being punished for it.)
---
Nothing will matter if less people are playing. That means lesser content which means lesser roamers and so on.
---
Honestly anybody that believes that the Nullsec blackout is just a braindead monkey. There is literally no reasonable argument to be made that defends a counter-blackout argument. If you are in null sec, you are in the PvP zone of the game. If you do not like being hunted, you do not like PvP, leave.
---
Excellent post. I have been unsubbed for 2 and half years now and I have been playing every single day since the blackout. Nulltards need to smarten the fuck up and learn how to D-Scan. It really is not difficult, there is no excuse.
---
tag checks out
---
&gt; what, just bounce and check dscan mate, unless you really think there is a 50 man fleet on standby in either cloaky shit, dscan immune or in a deep safe waiting for every on of your cynos i'm sorry to say but your super isn't worth even close to how much you think it is.
---
Yeah, just jump in and bounce... right to zkill.
---
I cant count the amount of insta jump cynos (suicide + jump in) that generated free capital KM's for me. I am not going to be one of those.

Currently jump bridges and cyno jammers are exactly what op is talking about. Important stuff like clone bays and markets shouldn’t be easily destroyable, certainly not without a reinforcement timer, so it wouldn’t work well with citadel mechanics.

What do you consider conventional? 
---
Here’s some ideas. 
---
  Invasions are new, so corps that focuses on that would be interesting.  
---
 Joining an high sec gank (or some would call RP) alliance such as CODE would give a unique EvE experience. 
---
  Thieves guilds are pretty unconventional and it’s a pretty good time to join one with Null sec empires shifting to the adjusted meta.  
---
   Even joining a mercenary Corp would be interesting since you never know what you’re going to be doing next.

*- Check, check... I have four Ravens and a couple of Command Destroyers on D-Scan, I think they are comming our way.*
---
*- Everybody jump, everybody jump and hold cloak! Let's see what's comming!* - the FC called as he jumped himself into the unknown threat.
---
A few more system down the path they managed to get their first kill, a [Svipul](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77793959/) class destroyer that died after thinking he had managed to elude the Sabre's bubble, only to find the rest of the gang waiting for him on the other side, where another interdiction bubble had been conveniently placed by the Sabre... mistake on his part or mysterious premonition, noone knew for sure, but knowing the pilot most of the pirates betted on the second.
---
They first targeted the enemy [Sabre](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77795274/), because they were obviously not going to let the bait live another second, but when the small ship finally blew up they saw their Fleet Commander's [Lachesis](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77795282/) go up in flames, soom followed by [one of the bombers]( https://zkillboard.com/kill/77795283/). They might have all died there, but the shout of their FC (who had regained conciousness in a new clone) made them come back to reality and check their directional scanners, where more and more enemy ships started to pop, like small drops of blood in an already red sea: - *Warp away and cloak, warp away and cloak!*
---
Luckily for them, they were far better at flying on their own than following orders or keeping any kind of fleet discipline, so not long after most of the surviving members of the group gathered in some unnamed system (*because fuck me if I remember the names of NS systems*) and started their long way home.
---
At one point on their way back the pilot of the Sabre went more suicidal than usual and decided to attack a Nereus that was floating near a Pharolux Cynosural Beacon right in front of a Keepstar near a gate... somehow he managed to kill [the ship](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77795954/) and leave without any reaction from the locals, so they continued their journey together laughing and feeling more and more secure as they approached their known playgrounds in the Low Security regions of New Eden.
---
As soon as the first ship jumped into the F7C-H0 system they realized their mistake. A bubbled gate and a dozen or more ships with various banners where waiting for them there (or well, they were waiting for someone at least). A couple of bombers tryed to use their cloaking devices to escape, but to no avail, so when the Sabre pilot landed on the gate everyone asked what he was doing. The answer came as the ship vanished through the gate: * - Fuck it, I'm not traveling all the way back, this is I we came here with a clean clone!*
---
One after the other the pirates took the gate to their deaths, their fragile ships that took advantage of their covert ops capabilities and where designed to damage big and slow targets where no match to the different combat ships waiting on the other side. [One by the one they exploded](), bringing some light, even for an instant, to the dark emptiness of space.
---
As the pilots regained their conciousness in their new bodies, they realized even the few bombers that had taken a different path where also with them, victims of an entire different camp on the alternative route. started to evaluate what had happened out there in this new reality, each of them silently assesing the mistakes they made -both individually and as a group- on that journey to the now blackened outer regions of New Eden. The silence was broken by the deep voice of their leader, the one man who after many years had somehow managed to mold that merry band of sociopaths into a close group of friends...

Yeah, just make sure you don't piss off any of the powerful industrialists (just like real life). Most alliances have brokers fees that discourage manipulation. And if the supply is so small that relisting higher causes a problem, then it just opens up opportunities for more industrial production and seeding.

When i said skill i did in fact mean player skill and not character skill points. I do agree that flying small gang is much more involved and demanding, but you can do it in cheaper ships, which means you can keep at it and eventually get good through practice without breaking the bank. It's true that everything happens much faster and as an inexperienced player you can often go from "hahaha you can't catch me you nerds" to "where tf did all my cap go, whelp, i'm dead in the water with a flight of warrior IIs on my tail". But at the end of the day, worst case scenario is you lose lost 30-50 million tops depending on your ship and fit (maybe a ceptor with some speed implants and a couple of boosters), possibly much less in the case of disposable tech1 tackle frigs.
---
Light tackle is probably among the top 5 most demanding roles in the game, yet we've all been throwing newbies in the deep end of doing exactly that since the game's early days. It's also how i started learning how to catch and kill stuff back in the day and if you have a good group to roll with (not even a big one, just 10-20 guys who know their shit), you end up learning a metric fuckton of useful stuff (positioning, manual orbiting, skirting the blobs, spiraling in, being a moving warp in point and many more) in a very small amount of time, for the cost of a few frigates.
---
I started with disposable rifters trying to tackle snipping armageddons that harrased our ratters (yes, that was a thing back then, the bonuses on the hull were different and there was no stacking penalty...say hello to 7 x mega pulse II on the highs and a full rack of heat sinks in the lows for maximum pew pew overload). Then i moved on to interceptors and assault frigs (AFs were very different and to be honest, quite gimped compared to now) and graduated to HACs. I ended up flying vagabonds pretty much exclusively for about a year before i quit playing, which were also quite different due to different bonuses and the lack of penalties on warp stabs.
---
Now i know how most people feel about warp stabs and i do agree with the nerfs they received, but they were in fact useful for small groups who routinely took unfavorable odds and often engaged outnumbered 3 to 1 or worse. Basically, they allowed you to be riskier and take fights you otherwise wouldn't.
---
So you basically ran around with a buffer tank (LSEs), MWD and a 20km point and picked fights with pretty much anything you could find. If it was faster than you, you could probably kill it. If it was bigger than you, you could probably outrun it. If you knew you'd go full retard, or you routinely roamed the entire southern regions in an evening engaging 5 times your numbers, you could fit 1-2 warp stabs in the lows and warp off as you killed the nearest tacklers when the shit would invariably hit the fan. You didn't have a lot damage output because you sacrificed gyrostabilizers for nanofibers or stabs, but you could make that up by adding a couple of buddies in the same ship.
---
I remember one time before they adjusted the whole stargate routing (you could probably travel from venal to stain in less than half an hour before that change), it was me and another guy in vagabonds and a third guy in a stabber (he hadn't finished training minmatar cruiser lvl5 yet). We went all the way from wicked creek to esoteria, stirring up shit along the way. On the return trip, some of the guys we attacked on our outbound leg had formed up in a bubble camp. Sniping battleships on a perch 100 km out, and a bunch of tacklers orbiting the gate. We just MWDed out of the bubble towards the out gate, started shooting the tacklers as they approached on a straight line and got out without a hitch.
---
Vagas were insane fun and the only thing i regret was not having a more industrial focused/money making alt so that i could buy a full set of high grade snakes to roll with during those times. I think the entire vagabond meta setup of the time was started by a couple of pandemic legion pilots when they were still mostly a pirate corp (i think it was them, maybe i'm confusing them with another corp though), they usually had snake sets and their vagas were zipping around at 5km/sec. But i digress.
---
See what you did there, you got old men telling stories by the fireplace and going off on totally unrelated tangents :)
---
So this just happned earlier today I was out scanning for lost fighters in null, after about an hour of no luck I decided I was just going to go rat. I'm heading home to reship. i was in an iteron mk v and boy what I was about to warp into was......well it was funny as hell. I was enroute to the gate to take me to the staging area when I land like 15 k from the gate, in a bubble, and freaking the fuck out. Seems I jumped into the remains of a gate camp my corp was busy dismantling, I watched as my little industrial tried its best to burn the remaining 15km go the gate, Hoping that the dominixes drones didnt decide to take me down with him. I got about 9k from the gate and bob smiled upon me. He sent a pharox to bump me the rest of the way to take the gate. All was well except when I got through the gate I about had another heart attack as two more bubbles popped when I landed. Lets just say the top speed of an iteron mk v is only 76 m/s because I didn't. Anyway that was how my lunch went how about yours! Also anyone got some nerve pills I need some!!!

Or, you can bomb the .01 iskers like I do.
---
I do NOT sell in quantity, but, like many, my Jita alt sells and manages inventory.  Often, I will underprice something far enough that it should sell very quickly (taking pricing history for buy and sell orders into account).  If someone .01 isks me, I will often drop the price by 1 mill, and keep doing so, dragging the bots down with me. Someone will end up quickly buying my items at reduced levels, along with bots' while the "real" players keep their better margins. I'm still making money, but enjoying goading the bots at the same time.

Eve started going down hill after 2014 according to this https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility
---
What happened during that time?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOo5RpZiI4c
---
Life was a funny thing. The willing defiance of order against chaos. The drive to create wondrous things, and to tear them all down and rebuild anew. Was I not a decent example of this? Here I was: Floating mostly naked in a gel-filled capsule, my body bound by cords that fed me oxygen and nutrients, while a neural cable was jacked into the base of my skull. In this cradle, I was given direct control of a foreboding vessel of metal and polymer, a swift hunter drifting lazily through space.
---
And yet, even surrounded by all this splendor, I could still find it in me to be bored. Yes, life is funny, but attenuation is the needle to the bubble, wasn’t it? I’d only been living this life, one so very different from my old planetbound identity, for less than a year now, but I’d somehow gotten *accustomed* to being a capsuleer, a living technological marvel. The first time I’d immersed myself in the tepid gel of my pod, I’d never thought that could happen, but now, I commanded my ship to orbit this stargate with the same dedication I gave to scratching my testicles.
---
Yes, this was the infamous “gatecamping” strategy. Around and around I went, my engines hot and the stars spinning all around me, as I waited for my unwitting prey to stumble into me. How mundane it all seemed.
---
My induction into capsuleer society had been swift, once I had proven I knew which end of my ship’s guns meant business, and my training had been even swifter since then. I flew with good people, now. Other capsuleers, some far more experienced than I at the art of piloting ships, were with me today, circling the stargate like vultures. I could hear them now, their chatter over our fleet communication channel buzzing at the back of my head as we whiled away the minutes and hours.
---
“Anything yet?” Our commander’s voice, low and sullen over the background static.
---
“Still nothing,” replied our forward scout, “I think if it’s possible for me to break my ship’s d-scan from overuse, I’m going to find out today.”
---
Another pilot in the main camp spoke up. “We should start blasting the local channel. *Want to buy good fight!* That’d get somebody’s attention.”
---
“That’d sort of negate the entire point of our being here,” the commander said patiently, “We’re supposed to be taking *advantage* of the blackout, not inviting a hot-drop.”
---
Ah, yes. The blackout. I supposed the ultimate question of alien life still remained technically unanswered, but the Drifters were the closest we’ve gotten to a strong “yes”. I’ve been told they appeared without warning, hunted capsuleers in their own homes on the galactic fringe, and vanished again without a trace.  Unnerving, barely-human bastards, they sounded to me. I haven’t had the displeasure of facing them on my own doorstep, closer to the galactic core, and I hoped I’d never have to.
---
Of course, this begs the question of why we were here in their stomping grounds. In the course of their rampages, the Drifters had disrupted local communication infrastructure. That must be quite the annoyance for those swollen-headed null-seccers, I imagined. Whether this was intentional or not from the Drifters was a question for people smarter than I, but for myself, and my low-sec comrades, communication blackout was an opportunity; a blind spot in enemy intelligence networks, where a gatecamp might be able to find its niche for a day.
---
Another crackle over the comm channel. “Oh! Oh!” Our forward scout exclaimed; his excitement was palpable. “Heads up! Fleet landing on the gate! I see Hurricanes with Scimitar and Sleipnir support!”
---
Our commander immediately began barking orders, and our gatecamp fleet began converging. Fearsome Machariel battleships brought their massive autocannons to bear. Swift Stiletto interceptors began screaming through the vacuum, ready to cast their nets on any hapless prey that came through the stargate. It was easy to imagine the other pilots quivering with excitement in their pods, just as I was. The fleet of enemy battlecruisers was hurtling towards us. In this single moment, the banality of capsuleer life was gone. A good fight was upon us.
---
The stargate flared, beautiful flashes of light appearing in its metallic cage. The fleet was coming. But these signatures on my information feeds, what were these? The enemy hadn’t fully emerged from their warp tunnels; they shouldn’t be registering on my sensors yet. No, this was something else.
---
“Another fleet is behind us!” cried someone, “Huginns and Lachesis!”
---
My gut twisted and flopped as their signatures began resolving before my eyes, the second enemy fleet landing fifty kilometers distant from us and the stargate. Combat reconnaissance cruisers; ambush predators with formidable electronic warfare at their disposal. Claxons sang in my audio cortex as their sensors swept over me, and began locking onto my own hull’s signature.
---
And then the Hurricanes arrived.
---
I wish I could say it was glorious. I wish I could say it was well-fought. But the purest truth is our fleet commander, ensconced in his conspicuous Proteus strategic cruiser, was killed within seconds by volleys of artillery fire, his consciousness transmitted back home, light-years away.
---
After that, we panicked. The enemy Hurricanes were quick and nimble for their size, easily evading the wrath of our Machariels’ plodding guns, and slowly picked us off with volley after volley of hammering artillery. And all the while, the recons, those dreadful recons, projected their terrible influence. They webified our engines, slowing us down. They scrambled our warp cores, snuffing out any hope of escape. The swarms of combat drones gnawed at us like ravenous flies.
---
In time, our battleships were broken and scattered, our interceptors were powdered or gone, and the haze of combat had receded. It was my turn at last, in my lone heavy assault cruiser, the Sacrilege. A defiant little beast, if there ever was one. I would miss this hull, I thought, as it was cloven in twain by the circling Hurricanes.
---
An instant later, I awoke coughing in my bath of amniotic fluid, light-years away. My commander and all my comrades’ new clones were no doubt in nearby cloning bays, probably chatting together about what had happened.
---
Out of all the things I’d attenuated to about capsuleer life, it was moments like these, when an old body was left spinning in the void and a new one was freshly released onto the universe, that I still had the most trouble with. The bath was always uncomfortably slimy and warm, warmer than my pod.
---
But I was grinning. Not gritting my teeth over another lost hull, nor grinning about the freedom of my practical immortality. No, I was grinning because the blackout had turned out to be a double-edged sword, and it had cut through the mundanity. I’d been ambushed before, by unwelcome third parties in the middle of battle, or by greedy, desperate pirates in high-security space, but I had always seen it coming, as soon as the attackers’ transponders showed up on local channels. Never before had I been so utterly blindsided. It was something new. Which meant, despite the losses inflicted, that it was something welcome.
---
If I ever were to meet a Drifter face-to-face, I think I’d have to shake their hand.
---

Data and Relic sites inside WHs with the keywords "perimeter" or "forsaken" are usually Drifter sites. You see the name in the probescanner if you're at 80% somewhat resolution. Those and also all WH sites that are above C4 are usually Guarded! You want to hack only the pirate sites with their pirate faction in the name, so "Guristas", "Sansha", "Serpentis" and "Bloodraider" are safe! Those sites however only spawn in C1-3 if I remember correctly and in those WHs there can also be normal guarded Drifter sites.
---
To know how strong enemys are its good to look into ship icons, for starters thats a great estimate on what you should expect. Mind however that Drifters in WH fuck your day up and neut, point you hard so its best to look into special fits or read Guides / look up Videos on your own for those cases. If you want to clear those Drifters from C1-3 Gas Clouds or Data Sites you need an uötra capstable ship for they neut up to 50GJ/s or something - again check some spreadsheets and look up wave triggers so you don't shoot them accidentally. Usually inside the shiptree you see the Icons for your different shipclasses, combat vessels and industrials etc.
---
High.sec is safe because your attackers will get destroyed no matter what, its just a question if they can manage to kill you before they themselfes get concorded (shot by CONCORD, the police!). You can't escape CONCORD in high and they will allways get your ass no matter what but they need some time to respond. There are Guides that explain those response timers very in depht but as far as I remember you have about 8 seconds in +1.0 security to kill your target until CONCORD destroys you and about 36-40 seconds in +0.5 security space. So response time takes longer in lower security systems, also if you attack someone at a gate or station you get shot at asap by those normal empire guards but CONCORD takes still a bit longer to get there and nuke your ass. Those normal empire guards and sentry guns around gates are not as nasty as the real police, they shoot at you and try to kill you but only CONCORD locks you down (scram/web/neut/targetpaint/ecm/etc.) - when they arrive on grid you're a goner and if your prey manages to survive until then you can't kill it anymore because you loose your targetlock. Usually if you try to gank someone you use highdps Talos or Catalysts and try to speed nuke the target in +0.5 security systems to have enough time to actually kill it, ganking someone in +0.9 might happen and they alao might get to kill you if they bring many ships to alphastrike your sorry ass but usually you don't need to expect anything there. However beware Tornados at tradehubs, they try to oneshot you with their 12k alpha but usually only get one or two shots before getting blapped by other players and CONCORD, so get some instah un-/dock bookmarks (look up a guide) to not die to them! If you set your course to the tradehub station (Jita), then warp to an instahdock bookmark inside the station grid and engage autopilot while warping the server will dock you asap and the usual instahlocker snipers wont get you since your docking request comes within the same servertick.
---
Lowsec is most likely the most emprty space (maybe WHs are emptier but who really knows ^marco ^polo ...) but there is no CONCORD response and only empire sentrys (gateguns) around gates and stations keep this space safe. But even Destroyers can tank them easily so its not much of a problem.

Yeah, I honestly tanked for quite a while before posting it, because it was going to just get downvoted either way. As a parody it's more likely to be annoying than funny, if relatable. And then if read literally it's obviously very stupid. I figured well, Falcon will probably get it and might have a sardonic kinda appreciation for the joke. Or he won't, and he'll go "yikes, what a retard" and get some entertainment outta it that way. 
---
It's not my finest comment, but hey, at least we collectively wasted a good 8 or 9 minutes of perfectly good human brain activity thinking about and discussing it.
---
Yup, i was thinking something along those lines too. Either a damage cap, or a form of sig radius tanking. So basically you would have one targetable item for the citadel/station itself, and various other interface "blips" around it for the service modules (cloning bays, market feeds, etc).
---
These service modules would behave more like ships and less like structures. Each one would just have a certain amount of shield, armor and hull. No reinforcing or timers. You shoot it long enough, it blows up, the graphics change a bit to signify the damage and the defenders can then choose to repair it with logis, resources or let it slooowly come back to operating status on its own (the station's existing maintenance systems/crews are doing damage control, but it's much slower than the players themselves helping directly).
---
I was around during the capturable station phase and well into the POS phase, but i don't remember ever being able to target station services specifically. Before POS we would just shoot the station until the shields were down, and the corp of the player who got the final blow on the shields would get ownership. They then had to adjust docking rights for the entire alliance, corp by corp (there was no formal alliance mechanic yet in the game, alliances were just collections of corps with +10 standings between them).
---
Maybe you mean fozziesov and the ability to shut services down with entosis links, i've read about it but i wasn't around for that.

For all your huffing about about how stupid I am you really failed to grasp a simple point, money earned 6 months ago is not worth as much as money earned today. Yes someone who plexes generates demand but that demand could also be generated by a bot or better yet, a simple terminal command. 
---
The eve economy isn't real, there's no real world value to it beyond the enjoyment it provides to the players. Players who just generate isk are not creating real world value, they're just changing bytes on a server. There's nothing stopping ccp from just printing more isk or resources with a simple terminal command and buying excess plex on from the market, it costs them nothing tangible, hell they could do it and you probably wouldn't even notice. CCP flooding the market with plex (which they've been forced to do on occasion) is lost income for them.
---
Obviously it's not as cut and dry as that, most players are not at either end of the extremes and there's value in ccp maintaining a balance, but the ideal balance for the health of the game and their income streams is one that favors the pay to 'win' players, not the plexers. To think that some no lifer changing bytes on a server is more valuable than engaged players losing shit and paying with plex is honestly laughable. I'm sure they're crying all the way to the bank. 
---
And for what it's worth I'm a software developer whose studied economics. Economics also runs in my family, I have an aunt who's a professor in macroeconomics at a prestigious university teaching PhD students and cousin's who work in the microeconomics of property development.

I don't even have a desktop machine, I only use a laptop to log in to the alpha account when necessary. I re-reviewed what is still playing this game, others told me that you have recently been in a bad state because wc is like your child and you have no time to take care of it. Indeed, my game time is negligible compared to the past few months. I have always been happy playing games, and I rarely sigh with people. I first added the territory of the so-called Chinese reputation to Ditrid, and stabbed the Russians to get what they wanted. Later, the revenge test harassed the dinosaurs in the frontiers and became extinct. The childish and real big-eyed education; until now, after the end of the nip, I only want to be a small country with a partiality, and there is no alliance left in the game. I am very angry now, test steals my child when I need to rest, so I will log in; if you also feel angry, because now someone wants to divide your property land, and even kill you fun to persuade you not to play The game you want, then you should also charge the card, log in, join us in the fleet.`

 `Dino#9232: way to kill your own morale

Dino#9232: "no matter what we do we will be outnumbered" "might as well go to starbucks then"`
---
the translation is way over the point but their reaction is almost tangible. goons bringing 2 full fleets today, we will be outnumbered no mater what. However we will take the fight like at the very start we refuse to ceed our space to triple the number of enemies.
---
We dont appreciate the ones who couldn't courage themselves into an uphill battle, that's why I love my coalition.

In the time you spent posting this, you could have already be in space.

The bigger the balls the bigger the srp.

I have occasionally dramatic mouse input lag - only when eve is running, and only since I switched to the 64 bit client. Sounds like what you may be seeing also. I am using a wireless Logitech mouse, FWIW. FPS is good, and all computer metrics are green.
---
Normie here. I don't play EVE. This meme is incomprehensible

1: When you undock, you consent to PvP. In highsec you are very safe, but not immune.
---
2: When you go looking to practice PvP, expect to die, ALOT. Just learn something each time you die, and you will be making progress.
---
3: For making ISK, find something that you like and go with it! If you grind till boredom then you'll burn out quickly (Even if your 'grind' is buying the occasional PLEX to supplement your wallet).

Super cap fatigue
---
I think what he meant is not a 200 vs. 1 scenario but rather a group of caps can be "outplayed" by a decent sized subcap fleet. Reality sadly is that a certain amount of caps is almost invincible to subcaps.
---
Totally viable, that's how I play the game.
---
So in order to run missions with an agent you require having a certain level of standing with them. If you'd like to find one you can run for, the agent finder is now located in The Agency just click on the "Agents &amp; Missions" tab at the top. it will display a list of available missions, you'll have to start with Level 1 missions for whichever faction and corporation first. I recommend flying security and distribution, since they teach you the basics decently fast as far as flying your ship goes.
---
Scanning, there's quite a few good guides on youtube. I suggest taking a peek at them.
---
If you need to learn everything about the game and haven't had a taste of much playstyles, join EVE University. They're an organization that specializes in training new players in the game.
---
Don't take this the wrong way, but if you're not into eve, why are you on the subreddit?  Are you interested in giving it a try?  If so, I'd be happy to give you a brief explanation :)
---
&gt;a few hours a day
---
I wouldn’t say that’s exactly casual. Sure, some people play for like 10 hours a day, but the majority of the game population works, has a family, does things, etc. The average age for eve is older than most games. 
---
I play like 1-3 hours a day, but if I have the day free I can play upwards of 5 or 6.
---
Well... I guess now I know it was only an hour.
---
But I was very confused when it happened, and I was (un)fortunate enough to run into the blackout. Realtalk tho, a sticky or something somewhere (like in a locked discord channel) would have been great. Was trying to ask about what happened to the sub in "local", and you can guess how helpful that was.
---
You're only dropping a cyno inhib when you've caught a target- By then it's too late. 
---
  You'll only dropping inhibs when shooting at supers or rorqs.
---
  If bottin VNI alts want to play the game: "had that loki left yet?" I can wait aaaall day. either way it's win win- Botters lose income, or they undock and I kill them.
---
Here's the funny thing. I'd bet 3 whole dollars that no other j space corps works better in chaos than we do. So we're just used to the amount of denegeracy that was going on in that hole. 
---
We're calmly just coordinating the fleet to juke the other fleets, points on unbubbled dreads, booshing novac, killing their logi, etc etc.
---
I thought those were nullbears, and carebears were HS only.
---
I'd change this to: It's a sandbox, you define your process
---
Playing this game casually means only 20 hours a week.
---
Heating mwd takes a while anyway, to get the full benefits, up to 10+5s, which can be an eternity.
---
That’s good to hear. Undoing the blackout would be sad, it’s been the best change in years. A cloaky pilot pinpointer is even dumber.
---
Got webbed at 14k probably because he overloaded webbs and started spamming at 18k or so. :)
---
Basically, don't run into him, try to go at 45 degree angle, pre-heat scram (if it's a bonused scram from the hull) and keep in mind that if he had dual webbs, overheated, he can't overheat them forever.
---
This kind of thing would never have happened in a wormhole before blackout. My favourite part of blackout is how there is no wormhole local
---
From your mouth to Bob's ears, my fren.
---
You used to be able to disable everything: repair, fitting, cloning, market, reprocess, each as separate modules on the stations, at which point someone would need to undock repair ships to fix it.  I assume that's the kind of thing OP was talking about.  It was annoying to fix, but I only saw it happen maybe twice in several years in null.
---
I agree that it doesn't work well with citadel mechanics, though.  This is what putting something through armor is for, these days, which is more like stuff turning off when you reinforce a POS.
---
qq.  Love it
---
Doubt CCP will ever reveal sub numbers. 
---
But it is mighty strange to do such a big event (have never seen 3 different events rolled into one) unless they wanted to correct something. Or atleast to show that everything is fine.
---
how about remove faction police, remove tethering for characters below -2.0 security status
---
seems like a good trade
---
Biker Gang Miners.
---
It was going ok but then our allies said we were trash and blew up our shit.
---
since when 5 Dreads are alot ?:)
---
np is always fun to share fuzzy memories - they seem about right though!
---
Sure lets make eve a pure pvp game, like that going save eve for another 10y, you don't clearly see the point of existing many playerstyles and only your that counts...ffs
---
&gt; I was around during the capturable station phase and well into the POS phase, but i don't remember ever being able to target station services specifically.  Before POS we would just shoot the station until the shields were down, and the corp of the player who got the final blow on the shields would get ownership.
---
You could do it, because I remember it happening... Twice!  It basically never happened because it was a pain to do enough damage in subcaps, and you probably didn't do that unless you wanted to be seen as having committed an act of war anyway.
---
And yeah, the mechanics for flipping stations were hilariously random sometimes, but that's a completely different thing from the shootable station services.
---
What if I have -10 sec status but have 9+ with the Navy?
---
I find it stupid that I am chased by a navy I have fought and died for for years.
---
Outlaws rarely go to high sec anyway.   Blocking logistics is silly because most of us handle our logistics on relatively neutral alts.
---
Bob rarely listens to me without a proper tribute
---
&gt;But that’s because the ramjag is the only real counter to kiters, something that’s fast and tanky enough to last against long range cruisers dps for a while. Against a brawler, jags just melt. They get 15 seconds from the adc, and then even with a triple rep fit they pop very quickly.
---
&gt;Kiting is only the meta if you are risk averse. Brawling ships still work very well, people are just too scared to use them. 
---
imagine being this bad at the game
---
We are all terrible pilots
---
Tears, Salt, Exasperation...you get the drift.
---
&gt;Its worse than that - who would want to fly a glorified battering ram that is only useful for attacking walls? That's boring.
---
goons?
---
fuck i missed it
---
It is not related to 64 bits. I have regulary (and I really mean REGULARY) docking and jumping orders not followed by the client. It is not even because of some potential reasons (aggretion timer, bug), it is just that the client act like I gave a warp order, not a docking/jumping one.
---
Most of the time it is docking orders who don't happen, so I make sure to stay on the computer until docked if I have to move.  
---
One corpmate lost a ship recently because of a failed docking order, and apparently it was the first time it happened for him, it was with the 32 bits client too.
---
Missing bibliography, -10
---
I could go with that.
---
Then it sounds like a non-issue to you.
---
Hi there welcome back friend!
---
With all the changes and skill points new players get now I would tell you not to worry about 'losing progress' by starting a new character. You'll catch up in no time as you're relearning the game.
---
Protip though. If in doubt, always go with what is the most fun for you. In this game it's easy to get bogged down with wanting to be efficient, but that's not nearly as important as enjoying the game. 
---
If you get far enough along you can always use him as an alt :)
---
Non meme answer, I play maybe 5-6 hours a week. I've had weeks where I put 40+ in but it really depends on what you are doing. If you are running a small corp you can lose a lot of time, but since those days are past for me, I end up doing small gang PvP or abyssals with a couple of friends, maybe an hour of incursions here and there.
---
I’m an EVE University dropout. They didn’t give me a freshmen title so I bailed. Probably the best thing I ever did. Got into a null corp, went on countless fleets, Killboard in the green, the scariness of nullsec was lifted. You learn a lot when you’re thrown in the deep end because you *have* to in order to survive.
---
How much sp does he have? With the new referral rewards you might be able to get more on a new character.
---
You can create up to three characters on one account.  You can keep the account and extract the skill points from the first guy to get the second a skill head start when you start learning again.
---
95% of players put in the effort of a public servant and have the mental capacity of a root vegetable, so yes, that won't be an issue.
---
Took me 3 tries before I got sucked in too, all thanks to EvE-U. 
---
And now onxe again back for the blackout :)
---
&gt;Hawks was probably able to tell that we were quite chaotic, but still props for dropping 3 dreads into our home.
---
I apologise for the noob question but I haven't played in years. Is there a mechanic for cynoing in caps in J space now?, or by drop do you mean 'bringing to the fight'? Looks like a hilarious mess regardless!
---
its probably because im stupid, but i can't find the KM..  link?
---
Yep, I'm stupid..

---
I get it, but it’s like over hunting.... you kill everything off and then we all starve.  We need the new blood, and that requires local.  I have a lot of respect for what you say but I want this game to survive for years to come so people have the opportunity to find the family and friends I have found here from all over the world.  This isn’t Black Ops III.
---
&gt;...these are placeholders that were made before we even released Citadels.
---
So what you are saying is that you have been planning this for a very long time....
---
Actually it sounds like you work with the cops...... but kill a lot of people. Sounds like they might want to have a word with you.
---
any gekyume foreskin?
---
&gt;good mcav pilots manage to win
---
I was laughing. Sequence of events in the hole between no vac and MCAV that I saw was "MCAV warped off, NOVAC warped off, MCAV warped back with bigger fleet". It was all good fun, and a really good reminder of how crazy things can escalate. We started looking each other with nano shit with 4 of us on comms, 2 hour and change later we are shooting a faction dreadnaught in NOVACs hole with 2 other corps.
---
no.
---
EVE can be one of the most casual games out there if you want it to be. You can always find a corp that is just as casual as you want, just make sure they don't have requirements of participating in X every night etc. If you truly want to make it in your own pace, nobody forces you to join up in anything and you can still play for fun solo too.
---
&gt;The game is supposed to be dangerous, right?
---
Yeah. Risk free ganking isn't dangerous. Dangerous means that if you try to gank someone without the proper support or intel you might die.
---
&gt;That shouldn't be a thing. What happens when off-limits roaming areas encompass the entire map?
---
Well then maybe you should go kick those guys out. I mean this is going to happen in any sandbox game where the content is other players. Someone at some point is going to win.
---
I'm gonna agree with the goon.. First Balls out move by CCP with out the lobbyists errr.. CSM trying to spin/twist it. Darkness pretty much sucks massively.. but excited that the game might be able to expect sweeping changes to fix the stagnant game play
---
Yes, I mean bring to the fight.
---
I am trying to tell this to every idiot that sends me this every 3 hours...  
---
Brb making time machine to go shoot the first guy.
---
This is your slow ass pc, not network stuff.
---
There is nothing any hunter can do you fly any ship correctly
---
Lots of ISP's have been having minor packetloss over the last month or so, it might be that.
---
Yeah because he felt null would be SAFER for him during blackout than normal times. Kinda the complete opposite point of it all.
---
This is a fallacy though.  Those were also some of the days where it was mandatory to have a l4 high sec mission alt if you were serious in nullsec.
---
Jumps are down, kills are up, pcu is down.
---
Perhaps the PVP'ers of EvE are less important than they think.

if you actually wanna do things you need multiple accounts. the people saying they can do everything without multiple accounts are either lying or just leeching off of someone who is
---
Should have dropped the Logger for the true chad-factor!
---
It is a true story.
---
As you can see from my reddit ID, I'm from GOONS.
---
Blackout's first day, After DT,I went out to eat meat with a fleet, because it was first day, no one had such a survival experience at 0.0, but my intuition told me that it was better to be a hunter than a prey.
---
Fleets are one of my favorite fleets in goons, because they usually go through wormholes. I hate the senseless running of dozens of jumps.
---
We arrived at Venal first, then to the PH's home. Maybe just after DT, the fleet didn't get anything. Then we changed a hole to FRAT, and it still nothing. Looks like everyone was frightened by the new change, but I don't believe that there is no fool would make a mistake.
---
Finally, we arrived the Test. We caught a few rorqs, three or four i dont remember. We tried to kill them, but the fleet was only 60 + bombers, and the firepower was not enough to kill them. But because there is no local area, we were really like fish in the water. We tried twice and put bubbles 100 km away from keepstar.wating them make mistakes.
---
Suddenly a bomber team from FRAT found the rorqs of  Test, so they began to shoot rorqs. To tell the truth, at first glance I thought it was the rescue team of test. They found our bomber fleet too and it was very embarrassing for a while.
---
Frat's people started typing locally and said, "Let's kill test rorqs together first."
---
In 《Three body》, there is a theory called Dark Forest , which means that if you find a civilization in the universe, you can't judge whether it is good or bad, and the best way is to eliminate it.
---
In fact, when two Reds works together in EVE, they usually don't trust each other. Even if we kill rorqs together, we will turn the guns and start shooting at each other immediately.
---
Given up the emotions , how would you choose? Is it cooperation or non-cooperation?
---
Our fleet chose to fire and kill most of the frat ships, but it also succeeded in protected rorqs.
---
Although I believe that  a goons fleet and a test fleet will cooperate to kill frat's rorqs, but shooting each other is the only option in the absence of trust.
---
Actually, this story has nothing to do with blackout. Of course, I can tell you how I like PvP and love such changes, but I really don't care about such changes, because the most mysterious thing about the universe is the human heart, darker than the local , is the human heart.
---
It's not so much that people like to have no local, as EVE players like to face up to their dark hearts.
---
And that's the cruelest and most addictive part of the game.
---
there's no need to fit what you have no reason to use, and that's a statement for all blops, just imagine how bad a statement you'd need for a widow specifically.
---
Make a hardcore blopsing corp that only bridges prospects onto ripe athanors in nullsec and then covert mines their ore. Call it "Whereditgo". 10 points for Griffindor if you do it in Delve.
---
Or a space janitor corp, that salvages battlefields. Just blue everyone and pay them a cut for letting you clean up after big fights.
---
Both sound derpy enough that I might just have to make them happen myself lol.
---
The standings system could use a fat rework, but it would be pointless without a mission rework at the same time or something.
---
Yea, like 10,000 an hour.. each
---
So, no offense now OP. You havent lived in NS? And been playing the game for a couple of months?
---
I commend you for your tenacity and willingness to both be active ingame and writing this post. I do however have to tell you that you probably dont understand whats happening. Or that null has for years been trying to get CCP to change certain aspects, the same aspects people are bitching about. Arguably louder and with more changes. So people like you, with an attitude that gives off the vibe that we wanted status quo and we can go fk ourselves because we dont wanna be everyone elses content, are dime a dozen. You have been taught about the game on reddit and not in the game, most of these fuckers dont even play anymore.
---
Its very easy to sit there and say these things when you are not affected in the least. But if you wanna understand what we are talking about my suggestion is that you take your corp and start building a home in NS. You will quickly understand why many dont like this change. And then we can have this talk again.
---
Would like to add 2 things aswell. Most of NS was empty before this, it was never an issue to "sneak in". In fact you could roam for hours without seeing anyone in space. And those "changes" regarding sensor stations have been there forever, CCP reps have already explained them as being non relevant to this. For now anyways.
---
TL:DR Try living in null and getting to know actual players there instead of on reddit, then talk about how an one-sided change is actually good for us or the game.
---
And in sincerety, no offense. Always glad when new players join and if I can help you in any way, dont hesitate to reach out.
---
Welcome to coalition discord.
---
Jokes aside, that is a lot of notifications, all kinds of em
---
You probably dont know me, but i dont mind.  
---
I joined eve in 2017, i found it on the web and thought "oooh thats cool"  
---
So i played for a while, left, rejoined, left, And finally rejoined, I joined a small corp, which i am still in, extremely friendly chaps.  
---
I am still not space rich, yet i am trying.  
---
Anyway here is my blackout story.  
---
\&gt;Booting Gugnir-046 Central Database  
---
\&gt;Connecting to local area FTL chat  
---
\&gt;Connecting...  
---
\&gt;Connection error, Unable to connect to automatic registering  
---
The captain frowned  
---
\&gt;Attempting connection...  
---
\&gt;Connection Failure, Do you wish to continue?  
---
The captain sighed at the monochrome amber monitor.  
---
\&gt;Connecting to Corporation messaging system  
---
\&gt;Success  
---
\&gt;Recent Messages

The captain browsed through the message board, Hi-sec mining operations working at full capacity to supply the wormhole fleet. Great.  
---
Lost another two battleships due to a wormhole fight. Great...  
---
Bounty placed on Fleet commander for... 666,666,666 isk.  
---
... Amusing...  
---
The captain then decided to undock.  
---
After the station undocking system had let out his ship (with a fair amount of cursing from the captains end as it added another scrape to the growing collection on his scout frigate, he had spent months out in the deadly beauty of wormhole space.  
---
He was currently in null-sec.  
---
\&gt;Dscan Activate  
---
Nothing new, a nice astrahaus that had let him dock. Couple of floating wreck from yesterday, a cruiser, two stargates...  
---
Wait... a cruiser?  
---
Suddenly the cruiser disappeared off D-scan.  
---
"Huh" said the captain. As he launched scanner probes. The battered, scarred combat scanners, that had saved his life dozens of times over the last couple of months, launched.  
---
Nothing on Combat scanners  
---
He frowned, the cruiser couldn't have gotten that far during that time.  
---
Nothing on Dscan  
---
Nothing in Local  
---
Nothing behind him  
---
Except for the silent sound of death in the form of eight Antimatter railgun slugs from the Proteus behind him  
---
  
---
This was my attempt at writing a short story... I am not great.
---
Imagine putting this much isk into a dread and fucking up the rigs that badly.
---
I simple rig swap gives +50% EHP and +Cap/s

No wonder no one responds to pings, they've turned them off.
---
Birthday suit and zip ties?
---
delonewolf on YouTube does a pretty nice weekly look at the markets
---
In wormholes it's a lot.
---
Look at the chain of events.
---
They shoot at MTUs, which flags them as Suspect.
---
Then the Marauder pilot thinks "I can take them" and opens fire, causing a PvP flag and preventing Concord intervention.
---
Then he finds out he couldn't take them after all.
---
Can you afford to bet 4?
---
Not really no, when the AF changes were announced, some people like myself correctly pointed out the Jag is now insane.  
---
The only real answer is 'be faster' or 'be stronger'.
---
but some kills don't have mtu kills. what about them?
---
nah. I haven't krabbed in a while
---
Only does it on one account though.
---
Good job friend. Can't believe you found a t1 1v1 near where I live. That's pretty rare. Faction warfare is a fun place to fight in small frigates and you can limit what you run against by going into the novice sites, only t1 and faction frigs can get in. I frequent that are as "third party" or pirate and just get into random scraps occasionally. If you find yourself without a corp and just want someone to fly with hit me up ingame "Kulrick" is my ingame.
---
Logic? Truth? Blasphemy? I dunno if those things are allowed here. A mod might need to intervene.
---
Is this a really shitty Jita scam? 
---
&gt;I need to make something clear: I was not begging, begging is a different thing, I was asking for donations
---
?????????
---
OP stop begging for people to just _give_ you money. what the christ
---
situations can change tho… ask the WWII soldiers in the Africa campaign.
---
Will check him out.  I specialize in my couple hundred items but always look to learn more in the game
---
It's time to Make EVE Difficult Again.
---
OK FREINDO THANKS FOR LETTING ME KNOW

Ima just go tell everyone living in our region that we really don't live in this region
---
Those unspoken dudes who are very spoken on reddit have won the day again
---
Never before has a point been missed in so spectacular a fashion.
---
dude, you bounce with the out cyno around the system to check full scan, not jump blind and rely on bouncing the super
---
Confusion
---
Do you imagine l4s being like 50kk/h?
---
I dunno if u play the game but the entirety of Eve is a PvP zone. And the issue was never about not PvPing, it was that these "elite" PvPers got butthurt because players actually started to PvP against them (ironic I know). With enough force to keep them out. So they cried and they cried and they cried until CCP introduced a NS Hulkageddon event, which no local is.
---
So for all their bullshit about player interaction and PvP, what they really want is that players in null stop interacting and stop PvPing, that way they could have fun picking off VNIs again. Yaaaay!
---
Maybe he didn't kill the mtu fully, just shooting a mtu grants a suspect flag.
---
They probably shot at the MTUs but didn't kill them. Just enough to get flagged and sucker someone into shooting them.
---
Carebears is a general term, in my experience.
---
Set destination to target station for docking, hit warp or dock, it does not matter. Once warp drive is active, engage AP, then go AFK
---
im currently leveling up an RP character, the plan is that once i had trained her to a capable skill level im going to form a corp for her.  the corp would have its own story and would basically behave like an NPC corp but the idea is to perhaps grow it into something bigger later on (i dont have Omega but one can dream of creating an Alliance out of it, Provi style). the potential issues? mostly getting recruits as its an RP based corporation with an emphasis on Minmatar characters with a Khanid background (trained to fly armor tanked and with missiles as main weapons platform).
---
The absolute biggest mindfuck that a game can deliver.
---
&gt; Is there a mechanic for cynoing in caps in J space now?
---
nope!
---
In about a year you'll put a 1% dent on my supplies. I was thinking 100k then maybe a 10% dent

queer little gamer manbaby
---
Can confirm goons dont exist. Was flying through delve and didnt see anyone in local. Closed my eyes and sighed deeply, telling myself it was a wasted trip. When I reopened my eyes I was back in my home station. Bob blessed my dedication and sent me home to rest.
---
Oh man that post history. I needed a good laugh. Toxic is a huge understatement.
---
The B4R system works when it is used properly. OP didn't come close to using it properly. tl;dr - salty incels begging for money and posting CC#s.  In fact, based on that alone mods should probably delete this, as running some algorithms it wouldn't take forever to get exp date, or security code.
---
Lol, you werent saying these things when there was local. Then it was "waaah waaah, we cant easily kill people". Hmm almost as theres a lot of hypocrisy going around right now.
---
Oh ye thats a fair point. Sure hope CCP fixes the issue with someone lighting a cyno in your hole and having dreads dropped on your head. Would be terribly imbalanced otherwise.
---
Lol.
---
Happy to help :D
---
what referal awards? how does that work? what are they?
---
Than some corps.
---
So you demanded people give real money, shoved your CC info in their face (thanks for posting it everywhere, BTW, I expect it's been maxed out by now), and now you have the absolute gall to insist that you're the aggrieved party in all of this.
---
You're absolutely fucking hilarious. Do a flip.
---
God it's not even funny as a joke. what the actual fuck is wrong with ppl nowadays
---
I thought about something similar with Caldari. Where we only use Caldari navy ships, modules, and ammo. Spend our time doing Caldari Navy missions and trading in loyalty points.
---
you get 750k free skill points. it's not a lot but it's helpful!

oh So you think that I didn't ask for help properly? How would it be proper then? Enlighten me.
---
What if they just made it where one station per system can mine every moon? Just a thought, but Id wager that could cut down a lot of the rediculous station spam.
---
PVPers don’t PVE is ...... lies......
---
the skill points equate to about 3 weeks of training as an alpha
---
 
---
for reference, 500k skillpoints is worth about $10 in isk
---
Dont forget abyssal space. You can read guides and train on SISI and do an appropriate level with low risk.
---
If you had less than 3m sp, i'd start all over again.
---
If i was to start today with RL money, i would get an invite (for the 750k unallocated sp extra) which would mean starting with 1m sp or around that.
---
Then i would buy some plex, sell it (move it around while being in plex vault, not in cargo) and buy from contracts the +3 implant booster (good for all chars below 35d), and i would buy a daily alpha injector every single day (good for untill you reach 5m sp and while your account is alpha).
---
Daily alpha + combat booster + some +2/3 implants + training as alpha would make you get about 75-85k sp / day, so about 1.5 months untill you hit 5m sp, with most of that in unallocated SP.
---
Then i would buy the starter pack (5 euros), which comes with 1m sp unallocated, putting you at roughly 4m sp unallocated with 2m sp trained.
---
After that i would go Omega, with 6m SP done in 6-7 weeks tops.
---
No. I didn't Demand anything.
---
I'm thinking delusions are probably a big problem for you.

I'm thinking definitions if for you. Read some dictionary.

Yes, join RvB.  Our playstyle is about as casual as you can get for PVP.  Here's our FAQ:

Pls keep killing each other til the minerals to build your ships run out, then let me know so I can resub and mine it for you

Showed up on a gate,
---
With bosons, their fleet would be shelved.
---
Ditto. I own no supers, Im just a dude who Exhumer mines Ice to keep our big boys fueled out here in Null. I used to just be able to do my own thing, sit in a field and watch the other ships come and go, I didnt need a Rorq or anything. And sure it wasnt pretty but it was a living, but now? If anything this just forces us to get further death gripped and sit under a Rorqual all day and night in a desperate attempt to get anything done.
---
Its not even the Hunters who scare me really, because lets be honest whos gonna bother one Mackinaw in an ice belt when theres a 3 rorq fleet sitting a few jumps away, but its the Drifters. I cant survive Drifters, end of story. And for what I do, I cant afford to replace a 300mil Exhumer, plus fit, every 10 minutes. So I havent logged in close to a week, because I cant do anything.
---
&gt; brief explanation 
---
LOL 
---
I've been interested in EVE for quite some time, but it's not something I have the time or patience to get into these days. Thanks for the offer, though, 'preciate ya!
---
i think your missing the meaning of this... well... translation, the way i read it he is asking himself why he havent just stopped yet but he refuse aslong as FRT is not safe especially now after his accounts was banned for RMT a while back. or maby i am fucking up the meaning.  
---
anyway it's nice to see him admit that he back stabbed DRF.
---
You mean those minerals that mittens said goons wouldn't be exporting to highsec anymore anyway?  Don't take this the wrong way, but you literally won't be missed.
---
That's why it's preferable that they reward people who put in the bare minimum effort
---
Ganking Damnations too
---
Do you know isk per hour of dread ratting a C5? O.o
---
Challenge. Interesting word. A challenge implies hurdles to overcome, implying there is a method of overcoming said hurdles. Right?
---
You explain to me how you are going to overcome the hurdle of someone who is logged of in your system, logs on and lights a covert cyno bringing in a group of bombers who then proceed to cloak up and land ontop of you.
---
Is it a challenge anymore? How about the other side, are they experiencing the same level of challenge, i.e., hurdles to overcome?
---
Im not going to assume you are ignorant, why I even bothered to reply. But this is not a challenge, not being able to counter certain things is just shitty gamemechanic. 
---
Its like going up against a raidboss that cant be killed, why the fuck would anyone enjoy that?
---
Listen to this guy but behave the exact opposite. Unless you like to be market-manipulated of course.
---
(placeholder, will read everything next morning)
---
Oh those things are definitely interesting and I appreciate it. Gives quite a bit of insights into how things work too.
---
What I wanted to say in the original comment was more of a general complaint towards EVE's combat system. It has the huge server tick and thus is quite wonky at times ("I swear to God I had tackle on him"), and then overheating, range control and those things can quickly get complicated. While I agree light tackle is a very demanding role we often let newbies do, I think this is more due to economic rather than tactical reasons. And on top of that, even something as simple as setting up an overview and make sure your UI isn't shit will take considerable time.
---
What I think that needs to happen is that the combat system should be more responsive --- shorter server ticks, better UI, some sort of none shit default overviews, and clear indication of any effect on your ship. I would love to see target management skillbooks go as well (why should newbies get a penalty on how many ships they can target?), and generally CCP needs to make sure battles run smoothly in larger battles. As good as small gang combining with capital artillery fleet is, if TiDi hits too hard then the small gang experience will be miserable.
---
You send a referral link from your old account and use it to create a new one. Then you can also spend $5 for a million more SP in the DLC store for either/both toons.
---
Almost any of the mods were worth more than my wallet..
---
Bah, let the numbers speak for them self we shall see in a month or two ..... there is only one constant truth in our world of business...... profits ..... and last I checked CCP is a business it also needs profits to survive..... time will tell if this blackout was indeed better.
---
When the real boss gets the final word ...... the costumer and our wallets.
---
there are also a shit ton of people resubbing. My prediction is lower concurrent player count because the botting problem is, in fact, mostly fixed with no local, but higher paying subs count, which is in ccp's best interest.
---
Ive been reading some of your comments and I honestly dont get why you are giving advice. When you clearly havent done any of these activites. Stop shitting up newbros heads with advice that dont work.
---
Who the fuck can align anywhere whilst doing these activities? You will get out of range and have to turn around and align again, like every minute or so. And besides, you can get bombed to hell and back no matter.
---
I never claimed to be a smart man.
---
What happened?
---
oh man, that is the first time I have experienced that video, it alone will the reason I come back! that was hilarious, I want to be apart of those fleets.  
---
I mean this with absolute sincerity.  
---
lol.... ahahaha.. gold!
---
Either it has been long enough to determine long term effects on the game or it hasn't. It can't be both at the same time depending on your personal preference.
---
When we were doing our nano bullshit we almost got your lachesis, then he damped me and warped off. I was pissed. Lol
---
I'm so happy I stumbled on this. About 5 years ago I wrote an outline to two stories that were EVE related, and I was so excited to write them both and be able to say that I wrote something that I would be proud to put my name on and ahre with friends. Life was busy and it never happened however. But now I have time to write one of the stories, and with a word limit that forces me to focus on pacing to keep it entertaining. I'll submit something before the deadline, no doubt.
---
Looks like fun
---
what if- different people can have different opinions?
---
Exactly! I never needed a blackout excuse for pvp was getting my kills just fine solo , small gang , camping gates , cloacky , big fleets war battles killing keepstars all have there own fun in there own way.
---
Whoever crawled out of that soggy dumpster 10 days ago and hacked the code together to create the most contemptuously useless bot this microwaved turd of a site has ever seen, here's some feedback for you: I hope someone comes and feeds you back into your mother's teethy cunt. Eat shit.
---
He probably gets his Reaper destroyed and comes back in his Leshak. Bait and switch.
---
Well luckily it was me flying the lach :P
---
You rammed me and I thought "oh fuck it's over" and almost panicked until I realized I had 4 damps and just o7'd your target range 
---
I was laughing quite hard
---
"will just adapt"  i.e. future tense - they will, but I'm happy to farm them until they do :D
---
Hot
---
What happened to six ? Isn't 9 usually the one that goes missing ?
---
Reddit based corp called Zappit... Its a training corp for logi and e-warfare players, and also a place to be rented for fleets, PvE or PvP. I need a logi for our small roam. I need a Falcon to assist me with a solo gatecamp. I need some help learning how to triage.
---
Interesting, can you add more then just "wIdOw BaD"
---
At first I was like "wew blapped the lach.. wait.. fuck."

Battleclinic, that's a name I haven't heard in a long time.....
---
Schrödinger’s cat?
---
but b-but but, if **I** were going to bot, that's how **I** would do it!!
---
I think the character was Carthelan EnDare
---
How do I not die like a fucking idiot and live in low sec? Also is it worth running a mixed exploration/PVP ship or just sticking with one fit? 
---
Thanks lads x

So there I was, flying my bling loki for the first time after blackout. I had been away on errands and my Corp mates had left already so I was trying to catch up with them except it was taking a long fucking time since I had to avoid the sv5 pocket and go the long way. 
---
Along the way I find a Sabre on d scan. No matter, I had nullification subsystem on, I think. As I jump through the next gate, this guy jumps with me and immediately bubbles. I'm slightly hyper ventilating now because this is the most expensive sub cap I've undocked and losing it to a small gang would suck. But I manage to cloak and start warp just as 4 kikimoras break gate cloak.
---
9,8,7 then it comes down to 3 kilometers distance between the two of us before I finally manage to warp. Now I'm mashing d scan during this time and most curiously I see a surprise party on the next gate. I had warped to a perch so I was fine with waiting for them to spring it, and eventually lo and behold you get the Kiki and sabre land. Directly on 2 moloks. That has already started their boson.
---
Need less to say they all melt and there is a bit of salt in local but in the end its kind of expected in delve. I gf the molok pilots, help them loot the ships then go on my merry way. I sincerely believe this wouldn't have happened pre blackout because no local meant they had the confidence to warp after me to the next gate without worrying about backup. Thank you for reading.

Can I show you joy of PvE??
---
I like me.
---
I thought it would be hilarious to make a corp called Ten Thousand Destroyers. With the idea of recruiting players to only fly destroyers (of any type) and just dogpile into whatever content they could. Surely in most situations TEN THOUSAND DESTROYERS could fuck things up.
---
Da best!
---
cringe
---
Who the fuck thought bots would have scouts on gates who isn't room temperature IQ?
---
Wtf
---
Actually, I flew out to the VSIG-K island in syndicate space and lived out there for just under a week just before I took over my corp. I'm also own three stations in wh space as of this month. So technically, I have lived in null sec.   
---
But yeah, your point is valid. I've never lived in sov null sec, and my time in the game in null is low enough where I really don't have a meaningful way of shaping an opinion from that side.  
---
 I think you missed the point that 95% of the players who try the game never live in sov null sec either though, and ***that*** is the real issue. 60% of Eve space is null sec, about 50% is null sov space. If 95% of the player base never live there, that means that the overwhelming majority of players never visit an area that takes up half the game space.  
---
It's always been an issue to sneak into null sec. Nullification, roaming wormholes, and cyno's have all been added/adjusted to try and make it easier to sneak in and out of null sec. What are you talking about?   
---
Yeah, if you read map data, use a scout, or listen and get some advice (or just get lucky), you can totally find the pipe systems that are the least guarded and get stuff in and out of null sec. There's some routes into the outer ring that are camped maybe once per week as far as I can tell too.   
---
There's a lot of players **months** into the game that don't know how to make that work though. Eves learning curve is famously rough for a reason, some of them are still learning how to d-scan on month 2, just how it is.   
---
Live in high sec long enough and you'll only every know how to navigate via the built in navigation, it seems like the only reasonable way to navigate to most of them. Reading Eve's map by scratch sure isn't easy to learn, that's why dotlan is so awesome, but dotlan isn't part of the game.  
---
So yeah, it's hard to get people to believe that it can be done. I can have hole control over a wormhole and it's ***still*** hard to get some players to undock in there. Gear Fear is a bitch.  
---
As an aside, Basically 100% of the people who've killed me in null/wh space as a new player were cool, and I died ***a lot*** when I was learning. I expect them  to all be pretty cool at this point, so I don't actually think of most of them as dicks or something. I got thanked "for trying" and straight-up given isk sometimes when I died sometimes. Trying to make it alone in an account less than 2 months old, I got props, sometimes.   
---
So I actually am not hating on the players out there, but the game out there.
---
Have it worked?
---
there was literally a thread about it a few months back. Dude said he was a programmer, and there were all these ways around deleting local, and it wouldn't have any effect on the botting. Lemme see if I can find it...
---
Na, been there not going back.
---
Its lonely out there, the eve universe has never felt so big. All the carebear type are no where to be found! the black out - a great opportunity i think?! All i know is pew pew and im out there chasing my dream of gitting gud. mind you, i am not very good with small ships but that never stops me from roaming. on this night it was a enyo that i purchased on contract from the alliance that i flew through baddy space (gallente superior race btw). Before the black out I had been on a nice streak of killing botting frat vexors in detorid - but **now**!! they are nowhere to be found -- when all the sudden .. VINDICATOR on dscan. I pinpoint him at a Angel Port (wtf?) and land on grid with him, PROP MOD ON, i burn to him. I see he has tech 1 heavy drones (haha) i primary his drones and they die quickly - this guy can not track me HAHAHAHA i am laughing at this guy who im sure is begging in his intel channels for help. he is dying and im sure i got this kill ive screen shotted it and have already bragged to my mates about what was happening.. when all the sudden .. **SOCKET DROP** .. reeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! i panick, wonder what is happening. im convinced this chinese player has ECM Bombed me somehow or hacked me - hahaha how could this happen at this time! this was potentially my best kill ever in a small ship since only catching vexors. Somehow my router was overloaded and could not function for 15 mins, bizaar! so i log back in, im dead, in a pod back home - and the vindi pilot had sent me 200M ISK randomly because i asume he knew he was dead! the blackout has been interesting so far my omega expires on the 24th ive been running off the free 15 days i got from twitch prime :)

Same with PvP, not interested.
---
Well, it definitely hasn't been long enough to say they won't.
---
good to see novac still fighting the good fight! nothing but love for my novac dudes
---
It definitely hasn't been long enough.
---
Something about monkeys and typewriters?
---
As you are suns surface temp IQ, I'm sure you will give a proper explanation as to why botters wouldn't put cloaky alts at gates?
---
Got baited into thinking this was Tigr. RIP that polarized bomber in the first clip tho.
---
It's definitely a solution.
---
I think having that character also botting in sites is more cost effective though. 
---
It's likely that even with them being caught regularly, they won't get caught often enough.
---
Especially if a single person is running multiple bots in a single system. It's unlikely they'll all get tackled at once, so they can dock up once one is attacked for a while.
---
I just don't think the bots die often enough for many other solutions to be practical.
---
Proof of vote brigade? Maybe not, but that’s how I’m going to see it anyway
---
Things have changed but not that much. Jump back in you’ll be at home quickly.
---
Where am I for comments? I don’t post, but I have lots of opinions.
---
That's not a player. That's a triglavian!!!
---
Pretty accurate
---
Get a life
---
- 2?
---
-2 isn't even enough to get the faction police to attack them.
---
This doesn't do much when you can simply sit in system cloaked. They'll have a timeframe where they think you're there, then they'll undock and get back to farming, and you can kill them. They won't know whether you took the exit gate or a wormhole, and won't know if you're still in system or not. Having alts on gates does almost nothing.
---
This is annoying. I'm -8.4 sec but 10 with the faction militia.
---
They still shoot me :(
---
Ultimately, even scouts-on-gates isn't a total restoration of peak botting. The carrier and rattle pockets are preeeeeetty obvious and well documented, and these targets will be juicy enough for routine logoff traps
---
so if they want to myrm bot with scout raitarus on gate grids, they're welcome to it
---
i'd happily take 20 years of that than another year of what went down in the botting scene over the past 12 months
---
Well if you are alone in your wh then yes, there is no cavalry. Rolling is a countermesurment to bad or boring neighbours. Eventually you can lock fleets out or in, we can't . 
---
And cynos are a double edged sword if you are in jump range for any hostile capitals your first question would be will I have a dread bomb dropped on me or will I not? You don't have that problem is whs you can't really expect that someone uncloacks at 0 and drops 30 dreads from few systems away.
---
Yeah, you are absolutely hopeless and not worthy of anyone's time.
---
You get some minor things like inflation right, but then for some fucked up brainblock reason you screw up the most important question - the fact that it does not matter if a player uses CC or isk grind for plex, in practice both generate income for ccp, the latter even more (20 euros for 500 plex, as opposed to 15 for a sub). The plex redeemal factor has no major impact, not in a way overly impactful to the essence of the question. You've written tens of lines of text and yet you've failed to provide a single argument why a plexing player fails to bring income to ccp and you'ne not produced a single argument to counter a thesis that a omega paid for by plex is simply a an omega paid for by another person that.
---
I wish you grand amounts of luck, because with incompetence like that you will need it in life. Utterly hopeless. This is the last I'll reply to your useless ass.
---
If a bot has a cloaky alt on a gate, couldn't I just bring in an alpha clone, warp to a random celestial, log off, and put the bot out of commission indefinitely? After all, the alt saw one person enter the system and nobody leave. So from the bot's perspective, there's one hostile in system
---
TigR is a gentleman and a scholar.
---
RIP indeed, why we ALWAYS stay aligned
---
lol someone is salty here ,,,,,,bring some sugar  por favore
---
Can it run ***what***?!
---
And they can chain production centers together?  It'd mean a lot less freight loads. Gotta have a solution for those too.
---
You so funny if u think removing local will solve boting problem :D
---
If your alliance allows it in space you aren't renting.. Sure. Although DED scan downs would be prime camping for hunters looking for blingy targets.
---
Downvoted because it doesn't fit the meta of you must grind in null or be a scrub. Such a shame.
---
Bots were never the issue, CCP is just looking for a way to make people lose shit, and keep them from making ISK so they can sell more Plex. I would agree the player count will drop... drastically, but not because of bots, but because people just don't like that Eve is no longer a full sandbox, but a credit card fueled space sim. And the worst part, is that CCP is banking on the PR from these stunts/updates keeping the game alive and milking the player base with micro transactions instead of coming up with a decent business plan. It may produce short term gains, but when the players finally realize that they are being farmed, it will be too late.
---
based on your flair I'd say you're already on step 4! nice!
---
When a hunter goes after a miner and get scramed.
---
I'm not going to lie, it does give me a lot of pleasure when I can drive down price of an item in Jita by simply dropping the price a lot more than .01 each time someone undercuts me. :)   
---
Obviously it doesn't last for long and sometimes some 3rd party just buys out all the cheap products and relists them higher, but it's still a dear hobby of mine.
---
stating facts isn't qq. but whatever helps you sleep at night, fella.
---
&gt; lets be honest whos gonna bother one Mackinaw in an ice belt when theres a 3 rorq fleet sitting a few jumps away
---
every single hunter - since they can't do shit to 3 rorqs sitting under an umbrella.
---
Not a chance? I hope it could possible with defense mode :(
---
Yeah your right, well thats kinda even more of a reason not to undock, huh?
---
Unless they are banking that the amount of plex buyers goes up enough to offset the decrease in people running multiple accounts.  Whatever their reason, it's pretty pathetic to dump it on the player base without a reason why.  People who don't feel like all pvp, all the time, feel like that's the goal.  As if industrial is a bad thing.  I suppose they can turn it into World of Tanks where you pvp and pay money for good ships.  When you look at the outcome, you can't help but wonder why they are hammering the builders as much as they are.  Unless this is some ass-backward way of slowing down the mega alliances.
---
First I want to know what in Bob's name an "anomic defense mission" is.
---
sorry i just ninja edited my post.
---
but yep, i don't see the black out being healthy for the game in the long term - people are constantly bemoaning supercaps and the umbrella yet all this does is force everyone to hide further under said umbrella that's constantly bemoaned.
---
and the value i found in null has just vanished, so i'm honestly wondering why i'm staying there. I'll be honest, as nice as the people are in my corp - i ain't staying in nullsec with significantly less things to do just because of them, i can leave my alts in the corp and keep my access to comms etc.
---
exactly
---
The goon emblem isn't accurate.  Goon will probably figure this out before anyone else.  This will hurt the smaller, or less avid corps and alliances.
---
it takes time for bots writers to adapt its why 99.9% of them are logged out dipshit.
---
a trend has been developed, less than 7 days is not enough time to see if it continues.
---
What alliance doesn’t allow you to scan and run sites in your own space? And obviously don’t run the 10/10s, do the lower level sites in a VNI
---
eventually they roll the dice and go back to botting we saw this with cloaky campers, this does not make bots stop long term it makes them stop for MAYBE a day, 2 days tops.
---
Join a corp, learn how to d-scan, join eve discord and ask for tips.  Rookie help can be a resource.  Fit your ships for specific jobs.  Any modules you add into a fit that do not support that job will make you less effective.  Most exploration fits are designed to get in and get out with minimal contact with combat.
---
LOOK AT DEM MILITARY INDEXES IN GAME 
---
MMMM YES NICE AND RED
---
It's only been a few days lmfao. Give it two weeks. Already seen some in Branch, just wait until it spreads.
---
Depends on what you mine.  For a few hours you can do 50-100mil.
---
Surely nobody would abuse that by inflating the estimated value of worthless items and then ganking their own freighter.
---
Honestly, Im kinda in that same boat. Been playing on and off for 5 years, just came back nearly a month ago and finally made the move out to null after running a Highsec/Lowsec Industry Corp (And it dying because CODE existed and fucked me at every turn). And honestly, all this has made me do is just want to go back to highsec and start over. Null has nothing for me now, and frankly it feels like Ive just been left out to dry.
---
That's not friendly
---
I wouldn't expect a bot to track ins and outs, just neuts on grid with the gate. Naturally this wouldn't stop wormholing in nor logging out, but random roams would end up in less kills.
---
you sound upset
---
I mean, seeing as it's been 5 days so far and the bots still aren't out like they were, you are, yet again, objectively wrong.
---
objectively wrong only if you ignore the context of his post.
---
This is probably a troll bait post at its best mkay!
---
Nice Fully armed boting op :D
---
Nonsense, with one hour of exploration you can easily buy and fit 2 t2 frigates, or a large amount of t1 frigates. You dont need tens of billions to have fun in eve.

i said they'd just go and bot other activities - since they haven't been banned and they're pretty much set up to farm isk for RMT purposes in most cases - there's no reason why they'd just flat out stop because 1 bottable source of income has been made less viable.

I assume its the difficulty of logistics and the inability of a single wormhole to support a large enough group. However I'm speaking only from experience of living in a C2 with a C3 static, higher whs might be different.
---
Bots will ALWAYS be able to do what people do with the current state of PVE more efficiently until CCP makes those things require intelligent input like range control and responding to dynamic threats like abyssal sites.

Five days isn't enough for a new ratting/mining meta to come out in the context of bots everyone who's botting now is probably using the same bot as before with a minor tweak. 
---
Remember bots don't care about losses as long as they come out ISK positive after their twelve hours session. They don't care about being ISK negative for a week after some change because they run for days and months.
---
I want bots gone as much as anyone else so my time spent farming in EVE is worth more because it isn't being devalued by botters. 
---
But as time goes by people will write bots that keep track of each other over dscan and warp off if unknown ships appear on it or simply bots that mine/rat in large enough numbers that it takes a small gang to challenge them and everything else gets nuked by small drones.
---
Alrighty "friendo" (weird defence mechinisim btw) have fun being delusional meanwhile they work on adjusting (not deleting) stabs to reduce their usage where unreasonable.
---
 The "points" you've made aren't nearly as structured and riveting as I'm sure you convinced yourself they are. So many of your statements are so misdirected by your misunderstanding of what was said that I don't feel the need to meticulously pick apart everything just for you to again reply with more misdirected qualms about how hunting is just to hard as is and you hate it when someone gets away easily.... without them having piloting skills? 
---
 There's no "piloting skill" in this game go play elite dangerous or star citizen and figure out what piloting skill is, it's point and click.
---
You might want to learn to hunt as a group and overwhelm your targets and tackle them together. You were so adamant about haulers grouping, why don't you? Don't you fly with someone with a dedicated tackle ship? You're entire argument is biased and doesn't hold up when the logic is reversed.
---
The "chances" by the way since you aren't capeable of figuring that out is weather or not the ship your going after is filled to the brim with stabs, has just one or two or has none. For you to even think I meant a statistical chance of a successful tackle each time the button is pressed is embarrassing.

ad hominem attack just proves you have no reasonable rebuttal to his statement.
---
Dipshit.
---
Wait until the bots learn to have a bot sit in a super and get dropped on other bots who need assistance.
---
If a bot can fire a drone they can fire a cyno.
---
"Bot writers haven't written new code and rolled it out to every botter out there over a single weekend, therefore botting is solved ONCE AND FOR ALL"

Honestly the only big newbro nullsec alliance with fleet requirements is karmafleet, and even they require like 1 fleet per month, over a three month period. If you aren’t making that requirement, you aren’t just playing casually, you’re just not playing. 
---
Even Init didn’t have very strict requirements when I was in there, I don’t think I was in a particularly good Corp (most of the reason why I left), but even if some corps did have higher activity requirements, it still wasn’t more than a couple fleets a month, and Init is not really a new player friendly alliance. 
---
Basically, if you’re in a Corp that is threatening to kick you for not showing up to their ops, you should probably just leave, because either they have too high of requirements, or you don’t enjoy flying with the Corp. Either way, with how easy it is to find a fun group that respects your real life requirements, there’s no reason to stick around.

It's very easy to get sucked into trading that it takes over everything else, if it gets to the stage where your updating orders before work and before you sleep then it's taken over and will burn you out. I suggest choosing one hour per day where you trade hard. If you dont have much capital then focus on volume. I'm specifically referring to jita trading.

I like how you're thinking. Please, candidate for the CSM next year.
---
A more sensitive head is a better head!
---
A simple story, i hope you enjoy.
---
My name is HuntedMaster, i play eve for pvp, ive had several characters spanning the entirety of eves life time.
---
I've seen changes come and go, i've helped alliances, started alliances, ran corps and started wars people will never know i had anything to do with, and that's the way i like it. 
---
This story is much simpler than all of that, much like the change that brought me back to the game i've loved longer then even my wife of 11 years.
---
For the past couple of days my corp/alliance has slowly been funneling back to eve, we were excited about the changes ( at least i was, and my enthusiasm seems to be working).
---
I had been doing logistics and slowly moving things back out of my asset safety cans from all the structures that died while we had essentually left eve, to be fair, mostly driven by me and my dislike for the total pve meta and how stale the game had become. 
---
I had finished doing some of the "boring" side of eve and relized i still had some of my bait ratting fits lying around, so given that the clock had stretched late into the AUTZ ( You wouldn't say that in the AUTZ etc) and most of my corpies were not on, i dont play with aussies we have a total mix of tz's which is great and bad at the same time, i decided id just throw a vni in an annom and see if someone would come poke it. 
---
Id almost nodded off watching random Conan on TBS clips when i tabbed back to see my vni with no rep on and a loki eating my alts face off.
---
The vni burned by the time my "main" was on route to see if i could get some kind of fight started. 
---
What happened next is exactly why i came back.
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/30002473/201907161400/
---
We had no idea what they had or how many, we pieced together some stuff from the other two guys who managed to hear my calls of a fight i was hopefully creating.
---
It was chaotic, and we fed a few expensive hulls that skewed the outward look to people who wernt there but it was a hell of a fight. My alts sleipnir had lived for far to long anyway.
---
No caps came, people reshipped, things appeared either side didnt know where even coming. 
---
This is not a grand tale of faction caps or titans DD'n everything in sight.
---
Its a simple tale of what i came back to find, and have been finding on mass so far, pvpers running into each other, brawling , and nothing but gf's in local.
---
Its spooky, theres no intel, people randomly show up and third party, and its re-ignited my love once again for the only game i will ever call my favourite of all time.
---
Eve is blackout, we are B.L.A.C.K, we are back, 
---
and we love it.
---
Thanks odins call for the GF's
---
Fly without fear my brothers.
---
Oh man, look up some videos of pufferfish eating crustaceans. Shits wild
---
Simply log off in the system and log back on in 5mins, they won’t see you in local because there isn’t one.  The scout cant send them to stations because it’s on a gate in the next system. turns out working as planned. 
---
Have a great day.
---
Gotta give him credit for bringing it out to a fight and not spinning it in station
---
I don’t think setting up a system like that would work too well in low, you’d be camped by cloakies and third parties. Without local and with bubbles, null would be way worse. You could do it in hisec, though, because of concord.  
---
But if you just roam normally, and have in your Corp description that you always honor 1v1s, ransoms, etc, and actually do honor them, then you’ll get a reputation in the areas you fly in frequently. 
---
Maybe have a list of reds against whom you are allowed to blob/bait, and put people on the list if their Corp pulls some dishonorable stuff against you. Just have it publicly available somehow so it doesn’t look like you’re breaking your code.
---
I will probably play an hour or two, every other day or even less.
---
I still have fun in the game and not have any issues other than falling behind in kill mails
---
This was one of the most fun fights I had in EVE so far in my limited few years of playing. gf to Odins call!
---
Great post, as a 03' player myself it's an interesting point regarding capitals.
---
I can only agree with your analysis.
---
I didn't say defense mission.
---
I asked will T3dd defense mode can tank in anomic base mission.
---
Right.        
---
Still no idea what that's supposed to mean.
---
I had this idea too, I planned on living in a Shattered wormhole but gave up when I couldn’t find one :/ I had 3 characters, an orca pilot, a Loki/ishtar pilot and a covops scanner/blockade runner
---
Nice, gj
---
Tiercide makes more complex choices and gives you more choices on deciding exactly how to fit your ships. Pre-tiercide it was just either t2 or meta 4, no other option was even considered, not including bling.
---
Are you saying CCP would  use concurrent players as a metric for measuring the success/failure of blackout? Seems more like a bit of extra incentive for people to get back into the game after a hiatus so that there is more interaction in NS to measure. Surely they would use something other than player numbers to measure success here.
---
Ruptures for the win
---
Now we just need bots that fly cloaky t3s and hunt ratters/miners, and we will finally be on track for a bot only Eve Online
---
I see a new meme arising.
---
Oh noes someone I don't know says I won't be missed on the Internets whatever will I do
---
Technically, a Keepstar can dock *all* the supers :)
---
You are still not adressing any of the points i have raised. Stop stalling.
---
Have you ever heard of cloaky camping? People already did this when local was still up
---
The Vendetta was a moron, and deserved to die, nothing of value was lost.
---
Source: the moron in question is in my alliance, and the 120+b lossmail served as a *very useful lesson* for the pilot who lost it.
---
Yeah.     
---
But isn't one big reason that you can't mine competativ and independent at the same time because of how rorquals work?      
---
If the main mining vessels were barges and exhumers that might change.
---
Wish we could make our characters look more like drifters in the creator, that'd be great.
---
Honestly, the future of ratting is going to be only in scannable sites, I think. Anoms might as well be deleted at this point, the only people who are going to keep using them are suicide Myrms and umbrella supers. And bait, I guess. 
---
But most ratters, bot and otherwise, will probably just strap a probe scanner into a utility high slot, and rely on dscanning probes to stay safe.
---
I mean, I'm not the one trying to pander for reasons to about unsubbing my accounts. The minerals aren't going to "run out", you silly choob.  There's plenty of asteroids in new eden, and plenty of hardy miners. Your miner toons are not the shoulders of atlas on which the whole of new eden rests.  Please, save us tragic hero complex and just leave quietly.
---
Haha so yeah it was you then. Gf sir
---
Cherish your kill mail sir. Fucking claymore getting final blow lol.
---
Some of the bots I've seen with upgrades are amazing, but yeah, updates aren't rolling out to fast
---
Looks that way. The leshak does an incredible amount of damage once fully spooled up too. I don't see many ships lasting long, especially if they're not using cap boosters to combat the neuts.
---
INIT for one rent out systems to alliance corps and you can only do stuff in systems your Corp rents. Gotta keep the other renters from losing out on their loot.
---
bro
---
I'm just bringing up an example that says "hey it's doable". I was solo, op is in a gang, they're not limited to one ship and they fly a ceptor, so they can have more effective tackle than I did, applying better DPS. I don't know if the ramjag has any resist mods, but I know my orthrus fit is t2/meta, most of my skills are lvl 5 and I always heat everything in situations like this. And I didn't alpha him, he was boosting, still got him down with several volleys. Correct me if I'm wrong, but ramjag damage mitigation relies solely on speed and shield boost, not resists, so a ceptor with scram and web basically neuters it completely as long as it's tackled close to DPS ship range.
---
And no, I'm not suggesting bringing a whole gang to deal specifically with ramjags. Work on your reading comprehension, it'll be good for you.
---
Reeeeeeeeeee! 😃
---
He's asking if a tier 3 destroyer has enough tank for the anomic base l4 burner missions.
---
I think not, personally. There are specialised fits on the forums for all burners, they aren't missions to experiment with unless you want to lose your ship
---
if you are new to burner missions, do them on test server first.
---
Activity was not very high to start with, but makes sense it went down even further in a remote region without the possibility of backup. Shame it's so remote that nobody else will use it, also jumps show that most of the people just travel through.
---
I definitely moved into wormholes partly to get away from no local nullsec. I mean, I could stick to big fleets, rat in scanned sites, and avoid going anywhere alone, but why bother? It’s a lot more work for less rewards. 
---
Wormholes are safer for most things except supers/rorquals, because anything smaller than that will die to a hotdrop before the response fleet can react. If I want to rat, I can get a good c3 connection and I’m almost completely safe. Sure , someone can roll into me, or maybe a hunter is flying through that random hisec system scanning for holes. But that’s a lot less likely than a hotdropper roaming TKE. If I want small scale pvp, I don’t need to worry about hotdrops or blobs, because mass limits and no cyno. If I want to roam nullsec solo or in a smallgang, I still can. 
---
I mean, if local came back today, I’d probably stay here, it’s certainly a lot different from null and I want to give it a good shot, and my Corp is very good. But long story short, unless you normally fly something tanky enough to survive a hotdrop until fax reps land, you’re many times safer in wormholes than you are in blackout null.
---
Legit question.
---
Do alliances ever kick these dudes out to save face with CCP? If I recall CCP was supposed to be leaning on alliance/corp leadership to flush botters out. I think this is pretty solid evidence.
---
How long does it take a Strat to chew through a barge?
---
Good job, no way would this happen to a normal multi-boxer, total bloodbath.
---
Half this damn sub seemed to think that, unfortunately.
---
Raise index slowly and switch systems. Otherwise the trolls come.
---
It's one of the Burner missions.
---
I'm currently playing casually. Just doing missions to earn a bit of ISK for my frig fits. Then I take the frig out to go find fights or something risky or do an activity with the corp. Rinse repeat. I'm not worried about earnings per minute.
---
Long live blackout. Just logged in for 30 min before work and got 3 engagements. People are roaming/camping in there own space in small fleets and random dudes are lurking around. What a time to play.
---
&lt;3 malaka
---
Buying from buy orders and relisting is pretty much always fine. What isn’t fine is buying out a stock from sell orders and then relisting it.

It took about 2 minutes I'd guess. It surprisingly didn't take long.
---
Like me :)
---
This capsuleer only has time to undock for a few hours each week, the rest of his time is spent working in his home station inside a class 2 wormhole, sweeping floors and what not, to provide for his family. He has to because his hunting trips became less and less fruitful over the years.
---
Structures which have been spawning all over his hunting grounds, advanced warning systems have been used more effectively causing immediate flight response from any potential pray as soon as a hunter enters a system, capital ships appearing at a push of the prey’s button. 
---
Yes pitiful the returns have been for the efforts of the hunter, forcing him to do menial tasks just to feed his family.
---
Rumours have reached the hunter’s wormhole that the advanced warning system is under stress and would potentially fail. The hunter started preparing various ships to take advantage in case this anomaly came into fruition. Not long after the rumours also came the confirmation, systems down, time to undock.
---
The hunter hunted and the hunter weeped as he could not find any potential target not even using his directional scanner. It looked like his hunting grounds have been evacuated. The hunter pressed on, close to desperation he ventured further out then he normally would.
---
At the brinck of giving up he jumped his last system before heading back home disillusioned about the hype around the failing warning system. For good measure the hunter warped to the sun for a final D-scan. The scan returned not one, not two, not three, but 4 Praxis battleship class vessels with support ships. 
---
Adrenaline levels spike and in no time the hunter locates the position of the fleet, relays info back to his fellow hunters. 
---
“Four battleships spotted, 10Jumps from home, get in light and fast ships.”
---
On closer inspection the hunter found this is not his ordinary prey these ships are fit for proper combat. They seem to be trying to capture some module that floats around in space. They behave strangely.
---
“GET TACKLE IN HERE NOW” the hunter yells to his comrades.
---
“Sabre 3 jumps out”, “Stiletto jumping in now!” come the replies.  
---
“There are at least 7 Praxis”
---
The fleet starts leaving the node.
---
“PRAXIS WARPED TO GATE”
---
The hunter did not understand the cowardice actions by the numerically superior and better equipped fleet. *“Why would they flee?”* he thought to himself.
---
“HUGE FUCKING EAGLE FLEET” came the answer to the not asked question. The hunter’s comrade who was one jump out spotted the fleet as it just undocked from a Fortizar class structure.
---
“PRAXIS TACKLED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OUT GATE.” Adrenaline levels peaked, heart rate followed suit.
---
I warp to the gate in question, jumped through and started applying damage as did a handful of other frigate and cruiser sized vessels fitted to be fast and nimble. The praxis was alone, but his fleet was in the same system. Scans betrayed their arrival before they reached the grid. We circumvent safety systems of ou weapons to squeeze out every drop of damage. Praxis is in low structure when his comrades arrive. The hunter and his pack members align to nearby celestials. 
---
An explosions lights the darkness of space for a brief moment and the pack scatters before any get tackled.
---
Not long is the pack’s time to rest. 
---
“MUNINN FLEET” shouts one of the scouts.
---
The hunter feels alive, it has been many years since the hunter has felt the hunter’s rush, the risk of death. Little did the hunter know as this fight was long from over.
---
While big fleets clash over a fortizar timer pirates do what pirates do best…..

Cool, did you report them or does it even matter at this point?
---
I'm not, I'm just voicing my displeasure in the blackout, and last time I checked I live in a free society. Not everyone has to like the blackout qbd many don't so kindly fuck off with your arrogance
---
Good to hear, nice kills )
---
Bots unlike humans are unlimited. You can program them to do anything this game allows, without automated scripts or AI from CCP to detect them u will never solve it, changing mechanics to prevent boting is making pve people mad.
---
The first one is genius
---
I did. My understanding is that CCP does their bot bans in waves so it'll probably be a while before they're banned, but I guess in the mean time, we can all continue farming them...
---
NoW iTs AbOuT yOuR fReEdOm Of SpEeCh?

There are multiple examples of bots trying to go back out in the last day or two, so its you, YET AGAIN, who are objectively wrong, because you failed to account for how bots act.
---
hey hoss great post \~
---
Maybe a bot?
---
I mean it shouldn't be on players to police bots other than by using the report feature.
---
&gt; long term effects on the game
---
It's been less than a week you over-anxious fuck
---
Where does all this bullshit "htfu and adapt or die you've said that for years" come from.
---
Who has said this? 
---
Additionally I'm pretty sure the miners/ratters that are complaining they need to join a big alliance so they don't feed kills to cloaky campers/ships that can't be scanned weren't the ones telling other people to adapt or die. 
---
Sweeping generalisations based on memes do little for your argument. Maybe you should add in "it's not ruining the game, it's ruining your game" at the end too.
---
Not the AAR we expected, but the one we really wanted
---
Of course PVPers are less important than they think (I am an at least occasional pvper). They just manage to be the most vocal. And the "big stories" usually don't are about finishing a DED site;)
---
Nevertheless, a healthy highsec is most important. It doesn't have to be that nullseccers need to be in highsec too, but highsec must be sprawling of life. Since that is the place new players come and meet people
---
You're right. But CCP was threatening to do *something* if players in power/authority didnt act. Part of this was the release of the botters banned per alliance. And semi-smearing their names for it.
---
It's a sandbox, the players in the sand box should kick other players out of their area of the sandbox if they're being shitty.

He is not in NRDS space. That system is owned by a group of mouth breathers.

Hmm. Frat's objective was to kill enemy Fort in own space. So they killed fort and won isk war. How was this a Test win? :D

Half this damn sub has the foresight of a blind weasel, news at 11.  It's like clockwork that half of the people here have absolutely no comprehension of how any changes will work long-term, been like that for a long while.  And they're still :surprisedpikachu: when things play out in a completely predictable manner.
---
You CAN run the Talos mission in a Jackdaw easily. The rest I doubt. But also are simply not worth their time to run.   
---
Even the Talos one is pushing it, only seemingly made worth it by their 3x chance to drop SS faction loot.
---
it's not a good meme, you're just circlejerking. it's an f7u12 meme, aka a dead, tired, unfunny, played out meme
---
have you noticed how 80% of the people circlejerking over no local are wormholers or lowseccers
---
that amuses me
---
The rest are in Berlin and London
---
Some people don't have funds to pay for a sub and for ships with real cash though.
---
That's why I don't understand the mindless hate for anyone mining or ratting towards a Plex on this sub. Paying for your sub and ships with real money doesn't make you a better player, but people act that way.
---
It's probably a different branch or deoartment chasing bad guys than the ones who organize militias. You know, just like in real life when the gov does one thing but then some other department does the complete opposite thing.
---
Cry some more.

stay strong brovac
---
depends on the faction. 10/10s can be done in a semi blingy  T3C, blood raiders 10/10 require a battleship with MJD and full of cap  (blood raiders neut hard)
---
Some countries the cost to sub is fairly high compared to income though, and some people are just in a financial situation that makes it hard to afford a sub and more Plex per month.
---
I hold nothing against people for ratting or mining to make ISK for a sub/ships. But this place seems to lump them in with botters, which is ridiculous imo.
---
In that case the counter is as it always has been in eve, have more friends.
---
\&gt;wormholer btw
---
am i crying or are you projecting your desire for me to cry so hard you perceive me as crying
---
Considering the retention numbers are what, like 4-5%, ye ofc 95% of those that try the game dont live in NS. Means nothing. How many of those 4-5% do? Thats relevant.
---
Those things have specific uses. Most of NS is empty. Thats a fact, not a discussion. Take an interceptor and start flying around. Just because someone has a TCU there doesnt mean that people are living there. This is one of the biggest issues with NS atm. 
---
Outer ring is camped because excav and rorq bpos come from there. Besides there are moonmining ops there and has been contested. Theyre not there for you.
---
That curve isnt nullsecs doing, quite the opposite. When CCP didnt even give a shit about the newer players multiple NS corps started recruiting them and gave them a home in the game. Now, I am certain they did it out their own selfish needs but nonetheless that gave a lot of players a reason to stay in the game. Today these corps are amongst the biggest if not the biggest ones in the entire game. Saying NS is leeching is going way too far without knowing these things. Do you think the majority of the people on this forum did shit for the new players? Quite the opposite, they are telling newer players to leave for HS right now. 
---
So you see NS is the reason why this game has still survived, not the other way around.
---
Now I agree with you, there are a lot of issues with the game. HS needs revamping, LS as well. NS needs some huge changes no doubt.
---
But you seem to be a person who enjoys the learning curve and understand that with effort and knowledge you will get better at this, right? What if I told you, that no local has an aspect to it in which none of your skill, knowledge, effort, isk, teamwork and so on matter? That there currently exists a method of causing multiple billions worth of damage without risk to the attacker since there is no counter to it, at all. And the victim has no way of not becoming a victim whilst doing what he/she has been doing for a while now.
---
Would you agree to that? To train for something for over a year and spend maybe 10b isk for a ship+fit that becomes obsolete just like that. And not because CCP deemed it so but because of an unintended consequence of no local. And its being done on a daily basis by the same people who are sitting on this sub saying they only want gfs and not to hunt defenseless things.
---
With no counter! Imo, thats bullshit. In many others aswell. People, especially on this sub, tend to be real shitbags. Same people have over and over spewed hate on NS over the years and now they finally have a CCP carte blanche to rape and pillage.
---
This is the issue friend. So it might be fun for you to daytrip into NS but you try sitting in that 10b isk ship and having your drones bombed to shit without warning nor any counter and I think you would be pissed as well. Mind you, I dont have one of those and this isnt personal in that way to me. I just dislike the fact that a persons skill and knowledge no longer matters, in a game in which skill and knowledge is the basis of progression.
---
Cheers mate. 
---
I’ve had that recently with my ratting Tristan trying to run anoms with full tackle. Plus the Tristan could not run anoms I was trying in any reasonable time. 
---
I’ll check out the recruitment forums tonight
---
Oh and the Amarr Titan has one installed by design
---
It's because sandbox environments have too many vocal autists and those are generally the people who can't be in large groups because they are awful people, so instead they just think the game should be balanced around small gang, you know like actual warfare... /s
---
Im not saying spend money on plex and Buy ships. In saying Buy game time and do what you want to in that game time. Grinding hours for plex just to omega sub would suck the fun out of the game to me because I despise ratting. I'd rather do what I want to do (which is pvp) and earn just enough doing explo/indy to do it.
---
Read any of the threads about the carrier meta from about a year ago. All of them have some variation of "adapt to the new meta" or "bring more friends" from krabs who seem to think nullsec is supposed to be Hello Kitty Online.
---
PvP is not a reliable way to make isk for the vast majority of players.
---
You said it, not as easy. But far from impossible, you just had to work for it. People presented it as impossible therefore wanting changes.
---
He, who controls the memes, controls the universe.
---
sp loss is a stupid, stupid, STUPID mechanic that should have been removed entirely from eve a long time ago (but hasn't, probably because ccp think it drives injector sales) and you should take a break from posting for even briefly considering that it's a good idea
---
remember that time when you suggested that jump freighters should get a weapons timer for jumping?
---
this is just about as stupid of a suggestion
---
bring back the old probe system and see who has the biggest tears
---
Literally no one suggested that. Making more playstyles valid is not making Eve purely a PvP game.
---
Agreed, and anti cheat would be exponentially more effective than removing local in the war on bots, but that's suspiciously absent.
---
Killed a hel last week in goku. Almost killed a nyx last night with munnins.
---
It is a little crazy when you think about it, technically being able to have an infinite amount of large ships in a single station or structure (citadels at least).

i mean

currently you can put up a courier full of trit for 1b collat then gank the guy in niarja

Well, you can still run sites in your corp’s system as well as all the public systems. It’s not great, but not terrible

Because late replies on threadnoughts always get read. I did reply there, there's zero replies to it.

I mean I wouldnt mind that one bit. It will make it harder for smaller groups to catch up tho in terms of supers/titans which would be my only complaint. I dislike the rorq and the fact that everything is caps (even tho I love caps). 
---
I mean, the rorq doesnt really need any changing in my opinion, just remove excavators. That way the rorq can still be used as a booster whilst mining a bit with t2s plus compression and the other things it can do. It should have never become the premier mining ship, that was utterly wrong.
---
This is roughly how I see it as well.
---
Local Structures would also imply ACL local, which would pretty much kill eve.  And just 'turning back on old local' would be pointless, its just the same shit with more effort and timers.

Before the blackout I ratted a bunch while also playing Albion Online. Saved up a few bil just to weather the storm and paid a couples months worth of Omega. I imagine it's a bit harder now, but not much more. I'm in null so yeah. Hisec losec and wormhole space hasn't been touched so yeah, their playstyles are still the same.
---
same, except:
---
&gt; I'm in the top 20? Clearly, I have failed to impart the proper degree of ~~zealotry~~ shit in my posting. I'll need to be even more severe in the future.
---
imagine only going for caps when you can pile in on them and refusing to fight otherwise
---
I'm the one saying not to judge it because its too early you illiterate fuck.

Entirely depends on what you set your goals as. If you want to do risky things in risky space that requires much more time investment than doing less risky things in less risky space. 
---
Time investment increases as your space gets riskier. 
---
Find a Corp with people that you like and have a good chinwig. That’s eve at its best.

Did you even read the post?

The sad part is that instead of stopping botting they just moved to cheaper ships....
---
Death to pvp

Combat probing. Only works if youre looking for something, if you dont know that youre looking for something its... You will spend every second of every day probing down that might be your own friends. Its just a stupid suggestion. You do that offensively, not for defense. And when are you going to do anything else? Like if all youre doing is probing constantly then just move to a wh and theres a lot less probing plus higher security and better isk. I mean wtf dude.
---
The other suggestions about teamwork does jackshit cause a t3c with bubble immunity will blow past everything then cloak up in a system and wait one TZ. The next TZ wont know he was there. He then lights a covert cyno and brings in an armada. And you only need a couple of bombers. 
---
"If your shit gets bombed pay attention". I mean I dont even know why Im responding. You cant pull them back in fast enough they are slow as shit. They are dead, nothing else. If youre lucky they miss with the bombs, most likely not. There is no pay attention or any of that bullshit. Its a method that cant get countered, period. Only counter was local.
---
You would know these things if had thought about it and actually flown any of the ships yourself. "Cloaky fleet wants to do anything at all they need to move around so you can spot them". I mean wtf dude. Thats a straight up lie.
---
And finally to the dumboest of them all, dont use excavs. CCP never claimed this was an attempt to remove excavs. If your idea of is to radically change the meta by removing one of its key aspects then... Now me personally, Id be glad if they vanished. They have fked up alot but thats not your decision, thats CCPs. 
---
Which brings us back, remove cloaks and d-scan immunity and keep your no local. Otherwise stop bombing excavs. But you want the cake and eat it. Which is why I think CCP will revert the change, because you guys are simply not responsible enough to not go full retard.
---
Leaving the game can hardly be called “manage”. But hey, you got your thousand likes!

In addition to what the others have said, there are also skills which help with standings:

Of particular interest for your situation is the Connections skill, which gives a 4% boost to your standings per skill level.

Sure, but the same way would be if he had corp mates doing that.
---
Some people will engage in 1 v 1, most wont. 
---
It makes no difference to you weather he is multiboxing or bringing friends with him, except that if he is multiboxing, he is splitting attention and is usually  preforming sub optimally.
---
see this is fun - we can go back and forth all day, you convinced i'm crying about no local because i'm a whiny big bloc spodbrain, and me convinced that you just desperately want me to be a person you can feel superior to which would justify your lifestyle as a wormholer btw
---
i could explain myself in more detail to try and prove that i'm enjoying the blackout, but you'd probably just label that as me blowing smoke to cover my krab ways
---
likewise you could go through my comment history and try to highlight how it seems like i'm a krab apologist, but that would ring hollow to me as well
---
more accurately, most of the time i just like playing devil's advocate and poking chimpy pubbie retards who circlejerk whatever opinion is popular (that's you)
---
The blackout came. It was dark and lonely. It still is.
---
Of course.
---
You character needs IRL time to get XP so it doesn't matters to be playing or not for progression. But to learn the game you need to be patient. The problem with casual player is not the gaming time, it is that really often those players lack of patience (they want instant fun) and got bored and never reach the step of actually understanding how rich this game is...
---
But yeah welcome dude, just come and join a corp as soon as possible after tutorial

Create your account through some ones referrall link. You will get 250k SP for your troubles
---
see what i mean
---
They live in a C5 Pulsar so that fit is exactly what it should be.
---
For small groups who have no chance to rescue sieged rorqs that would still mean to either calculate the loss of rorq boosters in or use orcas instead. Not really competitive if you ask me.
---
As for catching up to goons... I think that train has departed. Nothing CCP does will slow down goons in a meaningful way, while boosting other groups to build hundreds of titans and catch up. Let's be realistic.
---
&gt;this is a good post
---
By goon standards
---
yeah hes an idiot
---
Who cares, If I cared about WoW i would be playing WoW and not eve
---
Those structure types have been "announced" since the original upwell structures blog. Nothing new
---
Yup, I feel much the same.
---
I'm honestly struggling to find a reason to keep the main character on my single omega account in null rather than going back to high or giving wormholes another blast (third Time is the charm, right?)
---
Maybe if they bring local back via structure I'd return but... I dunno. 
---
If I hadn't just loaded up my account with 3 months of paid sub when plex hit about 4.2 per unit, I'd have been tempted to just let the sub lapse.
---
I love it. People actually undock now.
---
project more.
---
You mean the terrorists?
---
Narrator: They weren't.
---
Oh yeah. My old corp was full of sick fucks who would kill with impunity and I didn’t wanna miss out on killmails ya know?
---
If I was smart enough to search for kills by ship flown i’d link it. Long story short. Very Few Subcaps can get rammed by the scramadon and get back to their home hole.
---
You carb!! This is a game for elite PvPers, they don't like people like us. Just read other threads. PvE ruins the game according to elite PvPers.
---
please don't ever try to say 'top keks' again wtf
---
If only a certain corps CEO did a yearly recap of wormholes and talked about that kind of stuff...
---
Adapting is easy. But are the results of people adapting actually going to make the game better?
---
You fucks already cry about umbrellas and all this does is make it more pronounced.
---
Subcap are basically free kills unless they're just bait not actually ratting. So actual ratters either make easier or more isk for the same effort elsewhere, or upgrade to caps you can't engage because of the aforementioned much bemoaned umbrella.
---
been playing without local for a week now, don't miss it...even forget to put local up when I'm in low or high.  However, it is much harder to multibox scout now, the scout now has to concentrate on the gate or site they're watching, can't be swapping between toons or you'll miss targets.  And chasing targets across systems is also much harder now....just need more dedicated scouts, but who want's to be a dedicated scout and not get on any kill mails? Also feeling a bit lonely in my TZ and Region, don't see anyone anymore and have no idea if anyone is there to see....I think this is what will kill the idea...less player interaction will eventually make null life boring for players like me.
---
I understand why shield and capacitor because of pulsar. but seeing a vehement without web make me sad.
---
No u
---
I see a stainguy post - i down vote.
---
True, but you also had the potion to bubble a jump bridge or station to force a fight. With tethering and guns that can't be disabled, this is no longer an option as the structure just clears off any bubbles, and you can't realistically cover large structures with bubbles anyways. The fact that bridges can also be defended with unstoppable DDs if they are on grid with a keepstar isn't exactly great either.
---
Oh no. Something is hard to do, CCP you must help!
---
What makes you say that small gangers don't have real stake in the game ?
---
Honest question

Disclaimer: I didn't play Eve for years.
---
However, observing this subreddit gave me the impression that botting is a rampant problem. From my perspective, the blackout just caused a massive problem for botters and until they figure this out a lot of them probably went offline and on standby, causing the drop in playercount.
---
Why was it capacitor tanked?
---
i would say adapt or die, but pl is already dead, have fun becoming budget goons 3.0 in drones lmfao
---
I trade 400-500+ orders. Some players are clearly bot. If every time zone the same one player is able to 0.01 ISK you 10-15 seconds from your order change on random initial name items, that's a bot and can't be else.
---
Others instead update their items for 10-12h a day constantly. This is reasonably botting as well or just a very very bad life management. But can be logically either.
---
If macro is well written (I did that years ago, I admit) you can't win them, as they will trigger human approval out of exceptions.
---
Got any highlights to share?
---
I'm not sure how you define making the game better, I'd imagine it would be a game mechanic which offers a depth of counterplay.
---
Assuming you're not AFK, the counterplay for a PvE player to delayed local includes d-scan, gate scouts, mobile scouts, intel channels, bait fitting, warp core stabilizers, locator agents, spies, standing fleets, ECM drones, MJD, boosher alts... and probably a lot more things I'm not thinking of.
---
The counterplay to a supercap umbrella is to hope the person you're tackling is AFK long enough to get a cyno inhib online.
---
Which of those encourages more interactive gameplay?
---
I do as well, I can get good money. Yet it's frustrating to compete with bots with CCP doing nothing against.
---
Blackout was a good way VS afking, but botting...they are still far far away from target.
---
you should use links, drugs, and implants, like the pilot did and most people do!
---
nice upgrade btw you just made it tank 10 more unbonused hammerhead IIs
---
Heh heh heh manipulating Eve markets? Quite a conspiracy-that. Next you will tell me that one of the Devs cheated and shared corp emails of enemy corps with his Non-CCP alliance and even looked into enemy corps hangars with his CCP access and Hillmar covered it up and teh much vaunted CSM covered it up. You'll say Riverini knew but didnt publish because of his failed CSM run. 
---
 Crazy
---
You *would* be the one to bite the bait you fucking idiot
---
One thing that I would love to see on the structure side of things is a re-work of their guns and tethering. Tethering makes sense as a replacement for the "safe spot" that POSs provide. That being said it should be restricted to ships that are to large to dock in the station. If you are small enough to dock you don't get tether for safety, you get docking. Also, citadel guns shouldn't work if a structure isn't under attack. As they are now they are an unstoppable source of DPS and EWAR on any grid on which they exist. Citadel guns should be restricted to times when the structure has either taken &gt;5% shield, or is in an armor or hull timer. Instead citadels should use fighters ti interact with the grid when they aren't directly under attack. As it stands, fighters on citadels don't have a piratically useful place. They are however something an attacking fleet can interact with and potentially shoot back at. Both of these changes combine would mean that a smaller gang could force a fight by potentially bubbling the undock of an important station, forcing the locals to interact with them in ways they simply don't need to currently. It also means that you need fleets to defend FLEX structures from a small harassing fleet, instead of just someone with gunner roles.
---
Damn. Can't believe *we* missed this.
---
Probably not going to be popular with everyone in my coalition but 100% agree. Way way back when the loot in the drones was shit you could argue that no NPC space was fair -- less risk, less reward. In the age of ihubs, theres little difference.
---
I don't know. 
---
Have you *met* our leadership?
---
No it doesn't.
---
It involves buying a cap and fitting a cyno.
---
What you just listed is why subcap ratting is now a lot of hassle for piss poor income and isn't worth the time compared to a litany of alternatives.
---
Can't get this shit in kspace.
---
You seriously think that over the last three years you can say there's an *overhunting* problem? One change in the other direction, finally, and you act like you're being pushed to extinction? Get over yourself, and give us our game back.

Panfam moves to dronelands. OMG need NPC space in dronelands. We see the real issue here.
---

---
Lies, Frat doesn't bot, Elo would never allow it
---
It isn't about you as a person.  
---
A singular miner with a handful of accounts doesn't generate enough material to truly affect the market. This is why it's such a massive operation and why groups like the CFC are so heavily invested into their mining backlog.   
---
Delve, by itself, mines more than virtually all other regions combined. But on another example, FRT is still mining in Rorquals daily. They did change the way they did it, but they are still doing so while we're out hunting. A single miner won't make much difference.  
---
Hence why " you won't be missed "
---
We can, or we could back several years I am sure.
---
 Although, that was on the player **stations** not citadels.   
---
Remembering launching a smallish frig squad on a cloning bay service on the enemy's staging station (2011 maybe). No damage cap IIRC and an invitation for small raids and skirmishes right there.
---
That is also true. I dont think they will go back to the old boosting method tho. Orcas arent half bad either but they are no rorqs. If the rorqs are no longer mining with excavators then they dont really need siege either tho. I mean, CCP could change that.
---
Ye but everyone always talks about goons. Atm, no one can catch up to them and it shouldnt be anyones priority to do so either. Let them do their things. But there are a lot of other groups out there and being competitive as an alliance requires supers/titans. They are like nuclear bombs, deterrents.
---
Which is why cap ratting/mining needs smashing with a nerf bat. Delayed local doesn't magically solve everything, it just adds a bit of gameplay.
---
its ok you that you lack any creative thought despite you being autistic, imitation is the greatest form of flattery.
---
Did you just call yourself autistic?
---
Lol, just read your edit. Hey, that playstyle I have no issues with. I resent the cunts that have been bitching for years about NS this and that and are so fucking overly smug atm cause CCP basically announced Hulkaggedon with no local. Fking lazy "hunters" who want ez frags and dont wanna play if they cant have it.
---
Yay, now all pve in null is basically worthless... which gives individual pilots what reason to be there?
---
possibly
---
&gt; they fear they won't be able to delete any subcap gangs that roll through their space without loosing a single ship. that's why if you've ever tried to subcap roam in delve you get a capital fleet hotdropped on you.
---
Jesus christ people, that is not the reason you get the umbrellas dropped on you. almost no one in the big alloiances give a fuck about personal loses of anything smaller than caps because we belong to groups that can support and subsidies our play styles. the reason you get blobbed is because you are in our space, looking to kill our krabs. 
---
its non consensual pvp (which i know is the norm in eve) but just like you folks cry about having caps dropped on your 10 pussy nano kiting gang (because clearly its the krabs that are risk averse) the krabs would also just like to be left alone, and the best way to incentivise that is to make themselves not fun to fight. 
---
Maybe the take away here is, bring a fleet comp that isn't cancer and don't just hunt people who won't fight back and people will actually brawl you, but you don't, any no one ever does, cloaks or kiting is all these wimps ever bring and then complain when no one wants to 1v1 at the sun.
---
PvE in null will never, by definition, be worthless. For as long as people need new ships, minerals will have value; it's the massive proliferation of Rorqs which has driven that value down in the first place.
---
pretty sure they would prefer to fight something that hits back in their supers, problem is the rest of the universe is just as risk averse and won't commit anything they might lose.

I never ran one but the low level it's understandable cuz it has to provide enough leeway for players to fuck up. I was thinking about the higher level ones where you have to pay attention to towers prioritize rats that neut or rep and watch out for debuff clouds or kite enemies in them to kill them.
---
There could be a delayed effect, people don't all implode and quit on the day a patch comes out.
---
Yes, unfuck your overview 
---
here is how
---
https://gitlab.com/Arziel/Z-S-Overview-Pack/#how-to-install
---
Man, we went right past each other with our thinking. You're seeing the opposite of what I am.
---
Retention in Eve is just over 4% after the third month of playing the game.  
---
You seem to be thinking: "If you quit the game before the end of month 3, you probably never made it into null sec."  
---
What I'm thinking is: "If you don't make it into null sec before the end of month 3, you'll probably quit the game."  
---
For most players, there isn't enough outside of null sec to make the game worth playing for more than 3 months, that's exasperated by the fact that, while Eve allows you to do all the same activities you can do in null sec, outside of null sec, about half of them are non-viable. This can, and does, seem to work in two ways. It gives you the chance to try-out the stuff you're gonna do in null sec in a safe(ish) enviroment, and it slaps you in the face when you realize you ***need*** to go to null sec to actually do it as an Eve career.  
---
Something else that I think help me is that I'm coming over from *Escape From Tarkov* where, psychologically speaking, I think we face similar issues in different ways. In that game, which is basically a loot-and-shoot mil sim FPS MMO (only of it's kind sorta) you can expect to play for dozens of hours to get the best weapons in the game, which, if you try to use, then die with, you then lose entirely and have to begin grinding all over to get again.  What's more, regardless of how good your armor, weapons, ammo, and equipment are in Tarkov, Tarkov is a mil-sim style game where a shot to the head from a bargain bin ww2 rifle does realistic damage. Helmets aren't designed to stop high powered rifle bullets, the best outfitted player in the game can be killed by someone with one of the cheapest weapons in the game who gets a lucky shot. This has a result we call in Tarkov "gear fear". Players will get the best weapons in the game, then never use them.  Instead, they spend the entire wipe (usually about half a year) stockpiling a bunch of really nice equipment that they spend forever trying working hard to get, without actually ever taking them out and using them.  
---
Eve seems to be kind of like that, except it just seems to fuck over the new/little guy so. much. more.  
---
In eve, to spend so much time/effort (or, you know, cash for skill injects) to get good at something like refining, only to then realize isn't actually all the valuable unless you can go to null sec where the station bonuses are higher has the effect of players just spending forever to get skills that they then never use.   
---
I can ***completely*** understand why it feels like a slap in the face for null sec carrier ratters to just get fucked like they are right now, but I understand because a similar psychological event seems to happen to practically everyone who joins Eve when the realize they *need* to go to null sec to do what they enjoy about the game. Null sec is overpowering high sec so much that it seems like it needs to be nerfed, or at least it needs to be much easier to break into.   
---
I could have gone into null sec rather than wh space and high sec with my stations, and i would have fucking *loved* to do that with my moon mines, but your asking a new player to put a station in null sec to do that, and the same thing that is fucking null PvE'rs right now would just fuck me, and that's been the case from this side of the fence for years.   
---
From here, null sec is  "join" or "die". It's not that 95% of players aren't playing the game long enough to get into null sec, it's that 95% of player are spitting on the choice and quitting the game when they feel forced to make it.
---
I wasnt showing of retard. Just saying what I do in the game.
---
Other than mercoxit, there's nothing exclusive to null space.
---
The risk is there, the reward sure as shit ain't.
---
Decided to go on a quick roam in Delve. What could go wrong?
---
[https://i.imgur.com/8LhLJ9c.png](https://i.imgur.com/8LhLJ9c.png)
---
Our smol fleet: x2 Stiletto, 3x Confessor, 1x Hecate, 1x Kikimora, 1x Thalia, 1x Deacon (me!)
---
As we jump out of 39P-1J on the gate is a scary looking Vendetta with its emotional support Nidhoggur. We made it through and on the other side realised that was the only way back to our hole.
---
We jump back but logi were slow. As I burnt out of the bubble I looked back in horror to see the tiny Thalia swarmed with fighters from the Carriers.
---
Mavis warps her pod and we jumped toward home. Nobody thought anything of the casual mega passing by until we landed in space where our wormhole should be... but now it was not there. The whole fleet cried out in despair.
---
We search for other wormholes in the systems where we were trapped. Soon us wormholers are distracted by a belt of miners being guarded by a Rorq. As the only logi left it worked fine up until the 3rd procurer. By now the Rorqmom had realised I was the one healing - uh oh!
---
I warp off with 10% of my armor but also saw a sabre and a cyno. I bravely sat at the sun with Mavis in her pod as we gave gentle encouragement to our broken destroyer fleet that now had Carriers and Titans dropped on them.
---
Still very trapped; two Stiletto's, a Deacon and Mavis' pod now the only survivors. Two stiletto's are able to get through the camp while me and Mavis safe logged.
---
Next day I warp to the gate to make my escape but my confidence melted as fast as my hull when I hit the bubble ( [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77832687/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77832687/) )
---
Not long after my death something unfortunate happened to that Vendetta... in fact you might have already seen it on the front page of zkillboard.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/gxerL7q.png](https://i.imgur.com/gxerL7q.png)

The end &lt;3

2014 and 2015 were the years of "weaponized boredom" employed primarily by the goons.
---
So blackout does help with bots?
---
Aha, but you are wrong
---
If you miss out on training time you can petition CCP to apply the lost points to your account. I did that and had so many unallocated points (10m+) that i had to agree not to sell the character without applying the points first since that many unallocated points would unfairly inflate his worth.
---
If you miss out on training time you can petition CCP to apply the lost points to your account. The finished skills are finished though, no refund there.
---
Oh no danger in Eve Online ! This isn't what I signed up for !
---
The first time in 10 years when CCP tries... (and please note this is just a trial, not final solution to local).... Tries something that remotely benefits pvp, small gang, solo and you decide to "vote with your wallet".
---
PVP pilots had the staying power for a lot longer regardless of CCP changes - you sweet little carebear apparently dont, throw your toys out the pram.
---
Nothing lost there then...
---
why dont you go to highsec?
---
Upvote the man! He speaks sense.
---
Does this mean PLEX will be cheaper?
---
Living the dream
---
Are you allowed to listen? most, if not all, fleets are run with voice commands. In GSF we generally only require you to be able to listen to the FC.
---
CCP can find these players with a simple SQL search. That they dont, that they allow them to continue to operate, speaks volumes. They want players to kick them rather than banning them.
---
Very much yes
---
So let me get this straight. Im assuming you are posting this because bots are being killed. Which most knew. People said they would switch activities and the net sum of bots wouldnt change, if anything it would prob go up since new bots would be put in HS and for instance NS explo. So to offset the income nerf they prob will make extra accounts.
---
People also said that current bots would prob do their thing no matter local or anything and that they would still be able to get caught, no matter scanning alts or whatever.
---
So you are writing to be smug about something we already explained but you didnt listen. On top of that you are kinda fking over your sides arguments, namely that the player login drop cant be bots if bots are still active, right?
---
Or has no local changed that aswell, bots can be active but not turn up on the login count?
---
Because we told you, like all the rest, that the drop count most likely isnt that many bots, yet you guys insisted that the entire drop was bots.
---
So Im confused, are there or are there not bots out? Are they or arent they affecting the player drop count?
---
I was looking to hit this with a 'Nothing of value was lost' but then I remembered this wasn't Zkill. Still though, great to see a scrub Unscrub.
---
100% of the time for me. It displays information much more conveniently than the overview.
---
Tactical Overview for quick heads-up less-accurate information, Overview for sort-able, very accurate information.
---
I one case ISK changes hands while the other creates it out of thin air. That is what we would call another ISK faucet.
---
Actually it is something requested for years.           
---
Including current PanFam leadership - unless something changed since last declaration?
---
You won't be missed.
---
Hahaha you're so mad! You're a lawyer? That explains why you're a pent up crackhead with an inflated sense of intelligence on subjects you barely have a surface level understanding of. Unfortunately I'm not trained in educating mentally disabled children but I'm going to try anyway because your temper tantrums are amusing. 
---
If you put down the pipe for basically just regurgitated my argument back at me. I said that people who only redeem plex and don't spend money aren't all that valuable. The value they generate (pushing up plex prices to make them more appealing to purchasers) isn't valuable and can be fudged by ccp if they really want it, without the server load of an extra connection. Isk, minerals, anything in eve is free, it costs ccp nothing to make more. Server time is not. Eve is not a real economy, it looks and smells like one but at the end of the day there's no laws, there's no inherent value of any of the goods (except plex which equals server load) thus there's really nothing stopping them from artificially manipulating it and generating the value a plexer provides out of thin air. 
---
When a plexer redeems it is a loss because now they must provide the cost for that $20 they made. They aren't generating income, the player who purchased it is, and they would have done so whether it's redeemed or not. 
---
Moreover if a ship is 4 bil and a $20 chunk of plex is 1.5 bil, I need to buy $60 of plex. If plex is 2 bil I only need to spend $40. If prices are going up in the long term it means less people are buying plex and game time with real money. People buy plex because they're impatient and /or lazy, not because it's worth x amount on the market. Therefore there isn't a whole lot of incentive to keep a plexer around in exchange for players who pay real money. Yes there are many other factors at play but if you can't realise I'm simplifying it for your dumb ass there's no helping you.
---
You just have to prove the title wrong eh?
---
Actually it is his right to do it.        
---
Both because it is his money - but also as he have right to have his own opinion.            
---
If you cannot understand why i upvoted this?       
---
You will also not understand why i upvoted posts with people showing new subs.
---
I've always fancied this. How many accounts are required for this?
---
It’s for sure 2 minutes each.
---
People asked for npc space there for years. It's without discussion the best pve space for an umbrella  in the game. It's good that panfam is consolidating and finally start building up again. Although I'm not sure if they can with blackout nearly killing rorqual mining (after goons already built the biggest super fleet in the game).
---
Planck containers. Bigger on the inside.
---
Should be the other way aroud. Crab too much and you will gave to pvp in lowsec if you ever want to dock.
---
ITT: panfam krabs on suicide alert
---
&gt;when fighters can defeat the Death Star and its weapons cannot target and attack fighters.
---
Had it not been for deus ex exhaust pipe those fighters wouldn't ha e done shot to the death star.
---
Fairweather gamers don't deserve credence in arguments about the direction long term investment games should go. 
---
This is why despite how much time most pvpers jerk eachother off about how elite they are because they killed a bunch of ships that realistically could not fight back. They deserve a certain amount of respect in my eyes because they didn't quit when the going got tougher for them.
---
Sooo, i ganking Catalyst can kill a covetor in few weapon cycles, but for a Stratios it takes 2 minutes?
---
Keep thinking like that and you'll be missing scrub to shoot at. Because well :) you needs targets to shoot with your new loving blackout "trial" feature. A lose still a lose and someone quitting the game or unsubbing is never a good thing for the game. But well it's just my opinion.
---
Would you mind elaborating on your claim and providing a source? If you have, sales figures would be great.
---
I was pretty shocked until remembered that PLEX is just a new name for Aurum
---
99.9% of bots are logged out? Victory in my book.
---
Tbh this.           
---
CCP : We want make EVE more dangerous!   
---
Players : Yeay!          
---
^(hopefully not) CCP : But for some unclear reason we will leave **the biggest sov area in game** without direct access to NPC staging for hunters. So people doing PVE there can be safer.
---
Long-term? What is that? I only want GFs but my killboard pretty much only has VNIs on it. Im an elite snowflake and I need CCP to help me catch more VNIs since I dont wanna work for it and if I dont get my wish Im gonna ree until I make people stab themselves in the face after reading my posts. Then Im gonna fakequit and sit and shitpost about stuff I dont get on reddit.
---
Also, supers are shit, umbrellas are shit and you NS dwellers should just sit and eat our shit cause we are cool with our nanoshit going for carriers youre not allowed to help.
---
I M M E R S I O N
---
enjoy your silver, what ccp has done with this 'blackout' is dumb and retarded, they are just hurting their largest and most dedicated customers.
---
this is gonna be downvoted to hell, but fuck em, who cares about karma, we will keep fighting the good war until ccp comes to their senses and ends this madness.
---
Bye Felicia
---
YO I DON"T PLAY ANYMORE AND HAVEN'T PLAYED FOR YEARS BUT HISEC IS THE DANGER ZONE AND NULL IS TOTES SAFE YO.
---
SEE, WHAT THE GAME NEEDS IS
---
\*record scratch\*  Jesus Christ.
---
Less rorquals in Delve means better ore/mineral prices, so... thank you?
---
"there's nothing exclusive to null space"
---
Except infinitely respawning ihub-upgraded mining anomolies?
---
&gt;no capable hauler will move your shit if you pay 20 mil for a 10 bil collateral run of 10 jumps
---
I bet someone took that contract.
---
Ok.
---
Enjoy yourself. You've obviously done this before. Playing alone...with your Rorqual Mining Fleet.
---
&gt;!inb4: No! I really play every of my accounts! I don't use them for afk-farming!!&lt;
---
That's all well and great, but if after not even a week of blackout this guy wants to scream uncle and bitch out in a game notorious for it's patient gameplay and long timeframes for actions then fuck son, let him. I'll find someone else to shoot and EVE will still have lost nothing of value.
---
PvPers have been getting cucked for 5 years. Ppl have been told to adapt or die for 5 years.
---
If this is your response after 1 week, without even attempting the various means of counterplay that you have at your disposal, you probably should just play a singleplayer game instead.
---
i mean, i get this enjoyment on everyfleet that isnt blueballs.
---
i love my small shit dude cos its way more advanced than F1 monkey
---
lol, enjoy the game when all the subs and plex goes down and pearl abyss shuts down their failed investment.
---
Lately I've taken to using the SMA of extra cap hulls as station containers for the ship hangar. It works out pretty good and keeps me from having to deliver seldom used ships to myself to keep the list manageable
---
i ram bubbled a 50man kiki fleet in my beloved 1month+ old sabre (weekly cta's and the odd fleet here and there)
---
kikis 1- sabre 0
---
we did get one of them so 100mil for me for 300mil kiki...but not what i intended :D
---
You must be CriticoolHit, ruiner of threads, I'm always hearing about.
---
Correct. You don't permanently lose the Omega-specific skills/features though and once you reactivate Omega, things will be back where you left them.
---
All anomalies are infinitely respawning.
---
Im trying to figure out if youre being sarcastic or not. Not the last part but the first one.
---
Bob smiles on you.
---
Me too
---
Everything done right! That's how it looks for many soon. 
---
Action -&gt; Reaction ... thats the way it goes :)
---
Everyone should be aware of the fact that they vote with their wallet all the time.
---
What I can't stand are those "look I voted with my wallet" posts.
---
Some will agree with you, some will tell you that you are wrong, but in the end all you really want is attention.
---
Gj
---
Faction dreads are the least useful for my point of  view because of siege module you can't rep them and because they are so expensive they will get full focus.
---
And it's the same for officer module too few benefit for the price.
---
The one thing they are good at is to make people spend a lot of isk^^
---
ive lived in black rise, ive lived in tama.
---
ive done it in this game. one issue players have, is when they win in small gang, they think they are good. problem being all thier mistakes are hidden by the rest of thier friends.
---
in a huge fleet, f1 monkey gets pointed out when hes messing up, if this is you, your bad at eve bro.
---
if your flying sabre / tackle, your on your own, do you die every fleet? or 9/10 in your sabre, your bad at this game bro.
---
if your in a small gang, and if someone gets caught when you outnumber the enemy and its you every time, your bad at this game bro.
---
play to get better, play alone to get the best, and play with others once your 'learnt' otherwise, stop pretending you have any clue on everything to consider when being a good eve pvper
---
Thats fine by me. I'd rather have 1 year of actually logging in and enjoying the game than 5 years of a slow death.
---
Besides that, the fact that CCP is testing this ( and they are a company and thus mainly after $ afterall) means that they think it could be better for the overall profit aswell.  In a failed economy where ISK isnt worth anything anymore ( like we have today) there is gonna be significantly less PLEX sales than in one where ISK has the buying power of older days.
---
You have some good ideas. 
---
I was thinking of the communications structure CCP once hinted I believe, or the antenna as I like to think of it.
---
Say once it's online it can (for all ships within range (example 20, 40, 80au)), create a delayed local function, it can "connect" you to other services (think mesh antennas). Those services could be (just brainstorming here): access to some chats, access to remote market and contracts, heck your wallet and money transfers. Perhaps access to map statistics could be restricted without being connected to the infrastrucutre via player anchored antenna strucutures.
---
They should be rather expensive (think ISK sink for alliances; not great, not terrible) and relatively easy to destroy/shut down by other ships. They will be scannable. It will incent to your point of keeping a capital (a center of governance, not ship) working since the systems will need an actual infrastrucutre. This is generating content and not just another meny that you can click. Depending on how much space you own, how many live there and how far out is the system is they will need to be patrolled, repaired and reanchored.
---
This will require a gameplay upkeep.
---
Nothing of value was lost.
---
No, why would it?
---
Just about everything you wrote is either false, irrelevant or misinterpreted, but at this point you are not worth any more actual effort. Nothing even remotely refuted any of the points I made before. Your mental midget gymnastics are too much for any sane person. I truly pity your family, as they have to bear the burden of carrying your stupidity. Go talk to your alleged aunt, she might teach you a thing or two about Economy 101, but I dont think that at this point anything about your head may be salvaged, it's already too late.
---
lol if you think this will last 1 year, eat shit
---
We never had him to shoot at in the first place. The moment a neutral entered Local, he'd go dock.
---
There's no reason for there to be less, if anything there will be more.
---
Candy Crush Saga.
---
But to be fair, the other 9 games in the top 10 of 2019 are pvp games.
---
And to be also fair, all of these games target a very different audience than eve. It's kinda hard to draw any conclusions from a niche audience. Yes, pvp sells better than pve but pve still sells a shitton regardless and eve depends on pve a lot.
---
Hunting 10/10 runners is almost impossible with citadels as long as its not full spodbrain running them
---
The messaging from the Goons is that the black out is good for them, as this will maintain the lead they have as it makes it harder for other group to catch up.
---
9 self plexing crab toons?
---
Aaaaaand noone gave a fuck about it.
---
Sites that need to be scanned down might actually be a pretty good solution to afk isk
---
Now take that extra money and go outside, have a nice steak, a great glass of red wine, and think about the great times you had while playing EVE. Return in a year and move to highsec. With inflation under control all high-level highsec PvE will become profitable again.
---
Yeah... I don't really put much faith in what they believe could be good for profit going by all the failed projects they have poured money into over the years while cutting staff in the one thing that seemed to be keeping them running.
---
Let's face it, someone's been smoking something if they believe this tripe. There's no realistic way of viewing either of the last 2 days as a Legacy win.
---
And Noraus isn't quitting, OP needs to by the look of it.
---
The ministry guy from Harry Potter?
---
Nerf the Drone Regions by re-adding drone alloys as drops and removing ISK bounties on Rogue Drones.
---
To get your ISK, you'd now need to drop an easily probe-able MTU and wait for it to hoover shit up. THEN you'd need to reprocess it at rates far lower than ore refining.
---
Boom. The space is so bad that an NPC null island isn't needed.
---
&gt; just make sure they don't have requirements of participating in X every night etc
---
I really want to stress that 99% of corps do not have such a requirement. It's one of the biggest misconceptions people have about the game. Almost every successful corp is very laid back and doesn't care if you play 3 hours/week or 30.
---
Doesn't that only happen at the top of character selection once the 1st time you login after going from omega to alpha?
---
Therefore no real way to get that little omega time or cyno for a day accounts would be here already.
---
So how much? Does betting on eve related things with real money count against the rules?
---
Shut the Hell up! Those drone mails had value!
---
I don't understand this point.  With local he wasn't a scrub to shoot at because he could gtfo long before anyone got close to shooting him.   Now he's quit nothing in that respect has changed.
---
Love this post : )
---
Worst? At least there’s one. I learned from lvl 1 missions that took ages for me to figure out how to look them up and navigate to them.
---
Oh I get your thought now. But the thing is, I didnt go into NS right away, dont think most actually did. There are plenty of ways in HS to get far more isk than in NS. And people miss this fact, Eve isk making isnt that linear.
---
But I understand your point, I do. And these are the issues people keep pointing out, that the small guy has it hard to get into NS. But no local will make it harder for the small guy to actually keep being in NS.
---
But I think I get your point, and I am in 100% total agreement with you. Eve has kept its archaic "linear" progression from HS-NS even though its abundantly clear that it doesnt work anymore. So I get why you want a nerf to NS but this has never been CCPs wishes. Against logical thought, they have kept insisting that HS should remain crap. Which probably has a lot to do with the hate from the community towards HS or "highsec pubbies" as they call people there. This has hurt retention yet CCP never did anything for it. 
---
But, still, not NS fault. Does it need to get nerfed. Fk yes, and we have been screaming for it. Because we are starved for content and we have no reason to fight atm. If certain changes are made which would be nerfs to NS we would have to fight more often instead of stockpiling our equipment and never using it. Since we dont have to.
---
But CCP isnt fixing that, instead they have gone with a cheap gimmicky ruse as no local. Which will force more people to join or die. And we have somehow become the target of all the hate in the game for things we ourselves want changed. 
---
Understand what Im saying? Its not everyone against NS, or rather shouldnt be, it should be us against CCP cause they are ones that created the meta everyone is mad at. We just adapted to it and people are mad that we did exactly what the game wanted us to do. Now it wants us to do something untenable and we are arguing against. 
---
And you have to understand, NS has been nerfed several times the last couple of months. People arent mentioning it and neither did it get much attention because the changes were OK so complaints were low. But on top of heavy nerfs now they throw this on us and people are losing their shit. CCP went too far, if they had done this 6 months ago it would have been accepted with certain revisions as there still isnt a counter for certain things. But it might have been acceptable with changes back then but right now...
---
Well.. since local pop we never killed people ratting right or in nullsec ? .. stop with that bullshit argument. The fight that occure during blackout are small gangs trying to kill vni that met other gangs trying to do the same. The VNI murdering and stuff like that didn't chance either way because they're docked or because bot can react and adapt to the blackout.
---
"Post with your main" was a staple response on eve-o since the beginning.
---
O2 jayjay
---
Ah, so quickly dipping into Omega, founding colonies and dipping back out is a no go.
---
Then you're selfish retard. I give a fuck about every nerd that leaves this game, pvp or pve. Because every "win" of EVE is actually a loss for the game and the company that makes it. You lot have been yelling that "EVE is dying" for years, well if this keeps up it actually will be.
---
If this is true, why is he "voting with his wallet"?  Q.E.D.
---
Ganking Cats are superior beings. And so are gankers.
---
No, it won't, and I never said it was.
---
And not careing about someone who is clearly screaming for attention and unsubbing his 10 Rorq alts is hardly being selfish. 
---
But hey, feel free to go cry in a corner about it, I don't give a fuck about it either.
---
Absolutely the worst most toxic posting history I have seen in a long time.
---
I'm not him. But maybe, because wh is not nullsec we're mixing stuff in a "trial" way and like i said many times, people that will adapt will earn even more tears from "hunters" that are super happy about more easy stuff when they'll pipe bubbles and scouts on top of each gates. That will make cluster of crowded dead end systems that will dock up after the first inty showed up.
---
Then yeah we're losing people unsubbing to something that will change nothing from bots to people that know how to adapt.
---
I'm ok with content generation i'm the first one seeking for fresh meat and imo that not the good way. Less meat to eat still less meat at the end...
---
two things:
---
\#1 this:
---
&gt;*Note: Data is from the top 1000 threads of the year due to limitations of reddit / api / bots etc. 
---
\#2 stainguy makes a lot of very visible very well upvoted posts, but he also gets downvoted *a lot* because *most* of his ideas are stupid as hell
---
fair
---
https://i.imgur.com/57VS4Ok.png several hours before. heh good job fren
---
Can I please have your omega stuff?
---
\*Shrugs\* Dunno, don't use an Alpha. And I'll bet you a million Dollars mate, here and now.
---
Not that you'll get it, because fuck wasting money on something as trivial as this.
---
Massive props to him to have such dedication to his alliance.
---
In the end i just hope people that spend so much time for the game get to rest sometimes.
---
You must be really old to not comprehend the idea of a digital product.
---
i think anyone who doesn't generate their wealth in a way that can be interacted with meaningfully by other players doesn't have a real stake in the game
---
some small gangers have piles of money from AT prizes and that's moderately respectable so i won't fault them for that, but a lot of them plex, and while i consider that to be a valid gameplay mechanic, i think it reduces your credibility a lot when speaking about a change's impact on pve
---
wormholers i am conflicted about; on one hand, they have to deal with delayed local when they krab so they kinda know what they're talking about, but on the other hand i do agree with the position that krabbing in wormholes with delayed local is inherently safer than krabbing in null with delayed local
---
because in wormholes, someone can only enter your system via a wormhole. you can crit your static, anchor a bubble and put cloaky eyes on it, and then just open the probe scanner and set the filter to signatures and know instantly if someone rolls into you
---
in null, someone can log on a cloaky camper at downtime, open a covert cyno at a safe off d-scan, bridge in a dozen bombers, and bomb a fleet of rorquals' worth of excavators with zero counterplay for the defenders other than to just not rorqual mine or not use excavators. they can bridge in a fleet of torp bombers or covert t3cs, inhib an anomaly off d-scan and wait for a carrier to warp to it, then, again, with no counterplay to the defender, kill the carrier
---
not having to deal with the possibility of a no-counterplay gank like that which is inherent with the local blackout devalues the position of smallgang pvpers and wormhole raiders, in my opinion
---
I would love NPC space in drones, a simple constellation, with Triglavian mission agents....
---
Ok , I'm interested, what do you do precisely? :-)
---
When it's that blatant? Yeah, it should be up to the players. Tolerate a bot, you're just as much of a heinous wankstain as the botter himself.
---
&gt; every role a human plays needs to be fun
---
This doesn't work in a game where you may spend hundreds of hours doing it.  Nothing is fun if you're doing it day in, day out.  Mining is something you do semi-AFK anyway.  If you make it a mini-game, it's going to become incomprehensibly tedious, like carrier ratting is.
---
PvP is where you have "fun" in Eve.  Some level of satisfaction is gained from other activities like markets, building and so on of course.
---
Why? And how many?
---
Never gave me the prompt this morning...
---
Goodbye salty goon you won't be missed
---
agreed
---
So a heavily armoured crab is a lobster?

i want to sell my bath water, so need to farm attention
---
Catalysts have a bonus to damage against mining ships.
---
stay strong, comrade !

well then i wont miss you either !
---
Seems some people are getting it, others aren't.  I'd expect everyone to get it after DT today.
---
too mane ninja salvagers
---
Who knows.  If I click on the 'open link' button it just disappears and doesn't reappear on next login.
---
Anything that hits ‘renters in Malpais’ gets a big fat +1 from me. Many of these renters were botters anyway.
---
its already cheaper
---
Any chance the Wiyrkomi skins will make a comeback? a lot of them cant be found on markets any more :( 
---
or is there a way to get them ?
---
Or that was exactly my point. Games, movies, etc aren't "products".
---
'Oh shit people have stopped logging in while blackout is running! Quick release the SP! That'll get the login numbers up for PA'
---
Then you cared deeply about all the people who left as the pve changes hurt their pvp play style.
---
I have seen many of them I know return based on the changes.
---
Isn't one of the beautiful things about eve that it has a player driven market? If the supply of something contracts, the price will go up, thus making it worthwhile again, despite the risks and losses?
---
send me yours and i will double it
---
This seemed to be the main event info page: https://www.eveonline.com/now/season-of-skills
---
Agreed and remove all mining spawns from Delve!
---
Lol most dedicated customers

&gt; With enough force to keep them out 
---
And then they left the game. 
---
Years CCP catered to pve players at expense of pvp and over those years pvp players were leaving the game constantly.
---
What did carebears were saying? aDaPt oR DiE:Dd 
---
Now, the first time devs pinched your security bubble, carebears are crying en masse and threaten to unsub.
---
Do it, game enviroment will hardly miss few thousands of bots and almost\_bots.
---
Exactly this. Anyone who thinks this is unrelated to the blackout will believe anything.
---
People called pve Jews for the longest time then the culture switched to Krabs which is much better being a young Jewish boy myself.
---
You're either retarded or being obtuse on purpose, and I won't bother either way.
---
And? Goons will move to drone lands ...
---
What defense? They got trounced and instantly dropped dreads before we even got into their hole.
---
That was karma baby
---
Lots of input lag lately, especially with the right-click context menu. I have also heard complaints about the sensor overlay menu being entirely gone for some accounts.
---
rip credit card warriors.
---
you don't need hulls when you don't log in
---
Lol, would you prefer I called you dumb instead, because that’s how you sound when you pick and choose which part of the discussion to ignore, and you’re actually suggesting I blob you instead, which is hilarious, or as you put it ‘overwhelm you’.  
---
Thank you for another amusing post!
---
The way I used to do was running distribution missions in a region with a trade hub, like Amarr(Domain) and Jita(The Forge).
---
That way I make some extra cash while I update my buy/sell orders every now and then.
---
I also play the Project Discovery minigame since with that you can make over 1million isk every 5 minutes if you are good at it, and a couple hundred thousands if you play at a more relaxed rate.
---
The reason I do distribution missions is because it doesnt really require high end skills to get into(just a ship with a decent enough cargo bay---for the lvl 1 and 2 missions, an exploration frigate like the Heron, Probe, Magnate, will do just fine and you just haul stuff from one station to another--max distance is around 8 or 10 jumps.)
---
You also gain loyalty points from the missions and you can use those to get stuff like implants/faction ammo, equipment and ships which you can then sell for a profit.
---
The best LP(loyalty points) are the Sisters of EVE ones in high sec, in my opinion.
---
Their stuff never gets out of fashion and go for a fairly decent price.
---
I would have said mining(or mining missions) as an alternative to hauling missions while you trade but you are not gonna make much with a venture....
---
Another thing you could do is supply Faction Warfare systems with equipment/ammo/ships etc.
---
you could go on Zkillboard for those systems and get an idea what people use there looking at kills and seed those items.
---
But that is only if you want some extra activity while you trade. :)

Null has never been designed to be "scary". It's designed to be ungoverned by CCP/Concord. Nullsec is as safe as the current inhabitants decided it to be.
---
A tiny raiding party waltzing into a large nullsec empire and do whatever they want makes total sense.
---
If you're in a small raiding party and your pray can't be killed before it gets backup you are doing it wrong. I personally don't like Olmeca but he's doing it the right way. If you can't outright kill your target, harass it. Steal it's expensive drones.
---
It's ludicrous how people think they deserve to get kills. If you can't kill capital ships, go for subcaps. If you can't hunt in Delve, go to Deklein.
---
Null is lawless and lawlessness makes people stick together for safety, form corporations, corporations band together to create an alliance and then alliances form bonds with other alliances and becomes coalitions.
---
Alliances in Eve are essentially nations. What you do when you go on a roam is that you're not attacking the individuals who's ship you destroy, you're attacking their nations and the nation will adapt to it to provide better safety for it's citizens.
---
That is a move op I would love to see.
---
It’s been asked how many, answer is 200k for alpha accounts and 650k for omega.

“To train better skills and fight the triglavian invasion”

---
Whenever someone on reddit says I'm making X a Y I always divide X by 10 and multiply Y by seven.
---
Risk averse because of capitals being so strong.
---
It's basic common sense.
---
Botting is basically only increasing the isk price of plex. I hope we are on the same page on at least this basic fact. (as they buy plex with additionally created isk)
---
Now, there are 4 types of plex interactions:
---
1. Players who plex their accounts, if the isk/plex price increases, they stop plexing their accounts. In the worst case, they go alpha or leave Eve at all. Maybe, a small portion retain 1 account with $. But often the convinience is very high to not plex the account anyways and pay $. Only the ones that simple cannot afford the $ per months will constantly plex all accounts. -&gt; decreases player count, which is bad in the long run
---
2. Players who want to buy a specific ingame good (not isk!, but i.e. a titan). The more isk/plex and so isk/$ you get, the less these players have to pay in $  -&gt; less $ 
---
3. Players who buy from RMT -&gt; streight forward: $ for RMT instead of CCP = lost $
---
4. Players who buy a certain plex amount for fixed price (DLC, subscription, Xmas gift etc) -&gt; this is usually a fixed $ sum, isk/plex price has no impact
---
The main misconception is about the "Supply vs Demand". There are 2 "Supply vs Demand" equilibrias: Plex vs $ and Plex vs isk.
---
The plex vs $ quilibria has a fixed price set by CCP. RMT plex sales do lower the total sales of CCP-Plex, and therefore decreases the total supply, by introducing a fake supply line. -&gt; RMT lowers total supply of "new" plex
---
Plex vs isk: this is dominated by the supply from ccp-soled plex. and the demand of usage of plex. RMT is equal on both sides of the equilibria, therefore cancels itself out. -&gt; RMT has no influence on this equilibria
---
Btw: most people tell me, that higher isk/plex ratios cause more players to spend $ for convenience. This is disproven for a long time: The plex prices are 10+ times higher than years ago, still there are people earning the isk by boring stuff instead of just buying plex... 1 plex buys me a month of decent pvp ships.
---
&gt;Until then the rest of the 50 man horde blob is on top of us
---
Not necessarily. Just separate the ram jag at a good distance. At no point should the gang be able to warp onto the jag and you should be shooting him the second he loads grid to force him to adc and waste reps. 
---
They're not that insane if you know how to fight em
---
For tanking. Switched fitting from combat attack, to defense once too much pressure was on grid.
---
I am really glad that I have no idea what you are talking about
---
uhh yeah sure buddy ok
---
It's not often I'm compelled to agree with every word of a post in r/eve.
---
Take my upvote.
---
I'm glad to see them come back, but I have my doubts whether having no local changes all that much. Local has always been here, but the changes they all complained about were added later and are still here. Like I said before, all the "fun" for them now is about mentality, not mechanisms.
---
Thanks, I was slightly confused as the message disappeared as soon as I clicked on it and there was nothing in the launcher.
---
And yet all those afk/bot ice orcas in Teonusude keep on mining...
---
Oh OK, so security does get there fast. So in terms of security and being safe, all security +1.0 are equal.
---
OK thanks for the great information, I will probably need to know more about the wormhole classes.
---
Been asking for this for years.
---
yes you can, there is some big changes going on in eve at the moment that a lot of people think affect the game in a bad way, so if you are looking to get eve then look into the 'blackout' as it might affect a part of the game that you are playing for.
---
you can totally play eve on an alpha account and make isk, have fun, relax. you will not be able to do some things but alpha account \[free account\] is a totally valid playstyle.
---
Spodbrain is terminal, kids.
---
Many people did.        
---
But if CCP had balls to turn off local they will also finally do this.
---
If it's a niche that's small enough, sure. I would still ask about pretty much every game mechanic "if it isn't fun, why is it in the game?". There might be a good answer to that question, but it should still be asked for everything.
---
If you've ever mined or ratted outside of sovnull, you will know that scarcity is a thing. If you clear a lowsec belt, it doesnt just respawn instantly.
---
To be fair, there are lots of other regions that need some nearby NPC space as well.
---
More dangerous space should be more profitable is what id normally say....but *glances at low sec* ya....
---
There are multiple issues causing people to get annoyed with this change.  For those who are leaving/pissed off its a mixture of:
---
- it's been pretty badly managed, either no information or where there is it's being seen as conflicting (indefinite v temporary)
---
- it makes solo pve/indy game play considerably harder, not everyone has/wants 100+ supers on standby so they can mine
---
- smaller ship activity (barges/ratting BS etc) is a lot harder, forcing people into carriers or rorqs which some people can't afford or dont want to fly
---
- local was seen as intel tool for defence but all the attack intel remains intact - in game map, agnecy, anomies on the UI
---
- cloaky camping is still a thing and stupidly easy to get into with skill injectors, one person with one account is reasonable but a single person covering a region is stupid.
---
- it can be seen as forcing wormhole game play on nullsec, many people don't want that, they want nullsec to be different
---
- there has been a push by CCP and null sec  entities for years to make null more independent economically from empire, this change in its current form hits the less PvP aligned players/corps/alliances the hardest.
---
- it's can be seen as a cheap fix for a wider issue, all regions need a massive overhaul, this might be part of those changes but more reassurance of other changes coming would be nice.
---
I'm not saying everyone thinks this way but as a director in a mixed PvP/indy corp I'm seeing both sides.  I certainly think the indy side is being hit by far the most.  Will we adapt, yes eventually and we have an umbrella to protect us but the damage is being done.  Some more info on what the future end goal might go some way to minimising that damage.
---
/Me puts on the negative vote life vest as this is gonna be down voted so much.
---
Small gang is the best gang. Glad you're having fun.
---
Depends. Quite a few guys in horde earning their isk exactly by pvping and looting.
---
Now, if only dotlan would give us back the map info layer, so we could potentially find the damn systems they're in.
---
Anom ratting is an isk faucet, it bypass the market.
---
AFAIK some popular Youtuber or streamer started a trollish pornhub account and offered to sell her bathwater somewhere in the mix. Gotta farm attention and be famous before you can sell your bathwater successfully I guess.
---
Belts aren't anomalies. Wormhole sites move to another hole of the same class.
---
There are a few things that can related to the fantasy RPG tropes:
---
Capacitor = Mana
---
CONCORD=Town Guards
---
Rigs = Gems
---
Well, every newbro that does the tutorial and the first 5 Advanced Military career agent missions will die 3 times. After that, every experienced player who wants to grind standings with a particular faction will die twice per starter system during the Advanced Military missions.
---
&gt; Maybe the take away here is, bring a fleet comp that isn't cancer and don't just hunt people who won't fight back and people will actually brawl you, but you don't, no one ever does, cloaks or kiting is all these wimps ever bring and then complain when no one wants to 1v1 at the sun.
---
Why riski bringing a brawling fleet when you get stomped with supers anyway? Even solo roamers get carriers and/or dreads dropped to top of them. It get's boring after a while.
---
Dunno about fast mate, if you sit in a Frig with less than 20k ehp and get alpha'd of the field by two Tornados ... nobody can help you there.
---
I solo ganked Retrievers and Covetors for fun in highsec before, you only need one single Catalyst!
---
As for Wormholes, use pathfinder: https://www.pathfinder-w.space it shows you where you are, whlvl and affix.
---
No local is huge for increasing roaming fun in null. It’s not directed at the miners alone, it’s the chance of running into another roaming gang with the decreases chance of the locals dropping a perfect counter to you.
---
But regardless, the reason a lot of them returned that I spoke with was the clear evidence CCP is taking steps to shake things up and tip the scales away from ‘farm and fields’.
---
For many things that's true.  For example the idea of putting up "observatories" is kind-of dumb for precisely this reason.  If there's an alternative that's engaging for everyone not just FCs and logistics, CCP should do that instead.
---
But when it comes to mining I'm sure it could be done differently but only a radical change would make sense.
---
So be the change you want to see.  It takes about 5 minutes to train up some Catalyst alts.  Go save highsec yourself!
---
**I didn't say they were new anywhere, did I?** If you notice, I replied to CCP_Lebowski above asking a mod for a "misleading" tag for the same reason..."nothing new".
---
 I simply said that giving them a name implies a "purpose" right? If you just needed placeholders, call them placeholders. Yes these have been in the game files for years now, but the fact they have defined names tells me that CCP has **-some-** idea of what purpose those structures **-could-** serve if implemented at a later date.
---
I recommend using Agency to always find Lv1;2;3;4 agents all working for the same corporation. That way you don't spread your Loyalty Points thin.
---
my point exactly maybe don't roam in a place where people don't want to fight, if you are so desperate to get a one sided fight in your favour then maybe gank freighters in highsec or just git gud, git friends, git supers
---
By the sound of it your guys also did this to frt FC.
---
Indeed.
---
No down vote here. You raise some valid points. The bottom line is that CCP have clearly stated they are monitoring this. They will look at PVP activity, log in numbers, PVE activity, Mining amounts etc., maybe even look at log in of suspected botters - based on all the above they will make a decision as to whether wormhole style local is feasible or not.
---
I think the great majority of PVE pilots are not too fussed about the local change. But as always, especially on reddit, the voice of the unhappy is that much louder.
---
You're flat out retarded if you think eve is magically bot free now.
---
\*gasp\*
---
I thought my posting was bad...
---
Yes: log in, update your skill queue, log off. 🙈
---
Yep, but the drone lands are "prime" issue here.       
---
Stuff like omist also exists, but in size terms you just simply cannot compare it to drone lands.
---
Your AAR is watching the rest of us fight? MCAV are a much smaller corp than you so that's BS that you don't have numbers. Must be fun to be a TDBIN line member
---
It started as a term to refer to carebears living in nullsec i.e. renters and PvE focused players.
---
Today it´s often used as a term to rustle the jimmies of players of large nullsec blocks to imply that they can´t stand up for themselves and need safety in numbers to do whatever it is they do, be it PvE or PvP focused.
---
Obviously the second option is much more fun to use in the proper context.
---
The fact is it's gone way too far to the other side.  CCP have now basically killed mining and ratting and exploration..  That's stupid..
---
There was nothing stopping you PvPing before blackout.  All people are doing is ganking not pvping that's an accidental outcome of you all trying to kill none pvp folk.
---
The fact also is eve relies heavily on Indy and PVE for the economy.  If we didnt have thaoe we would have ships or modules etc and I for one winter be happy paying 1 bill for a tnegu for example because no one was able to supply the market
---
2much text
---
They where just checking if you are still there...
---
another retard gone, man CCP really did something right this time
---
CCP also knows how much money they make from Bot-Accounts.
---
adapt or die i'd say
---
LMAO I GET IT IT IS BECAUSE GOONSWARM LOGO IS A BEE RIGHT???
---
Well I recently got cap hot dropped because I engaged a TEST proteus (not a krab) on a gate but that's another story... 
---
Sorry but most of the time ganking karbs is the only pvp content that I can find in null... And most of the time when me and my mates actually find fights it's always a fleet responding to their krab attack. I don't know a more efficent way of finding pvp than attacking krabs sadly, do you know one i would love to know please ?

Well sed.

cuz its blackout

---
That was rather cringe inducing
---
if you find it hard to kill rorqs check zkill and learn something
---
or unsub
---
That is not entirely correct, I have roamed different region the last few days and encountered plenty of pvp from the various locals. The kind of pvp that before blackout was not as common. Gatecamps, more pretend PVE ratter or miner traps, smaller gangs roaming near staging systems etc.
---
Had local never existed nobody would know any better.
---
But after 16 years of having eazy mode, when local is gone everyone cries.
---
From a realism perspective, local never made sense anyway.
---
Lets just way for the statistics on this first blackout implementation. If the numbers are positive, may it continue, if the economy, log in numbers or pvp activity suffers then lets tone it down.
---
Haven't played for 8 years. I have finished school and graduated from university with masters degree, found job. Yesterday logged in alpha mode and completed one 3lvl mission, so relaxing. From one hand this is good old eve but from another hand I see no major changes. Game is neither following nor trying to adapt to modern game experience, I think this is why online went down. I have connected to the oldest russian newbie help channel and found 40 players online and silence. I remember 300 at least and up to 500 in peak online with endless conversations. That made me sad.
---
What. No.
---
ye, everything will go up in price cuz of no supply from dead crabs, and plex will be cheaper cuz crabs unsub. Oh the irony
---
Sadly i played all games while afk crabbing. now i need new afk game
---
Dude, when you camp cynos, you cloak camp them.
---
PLEX is directly linked to the price of one months subscription in real hard cash of your choice. CCP will never let it drop long term against that peg, to do so would destroy the game as CCP will go bust as everyone would cancel their cash sub and rat for ever to buy it cheaper.  CCP may let it float within certain parameters +- a few points but any long term damage to the price will be addressed quickly to prevent a no cash sub model from being sustainable.
---
*ding!*
---
So now you want a gate from Stain to Cobalt Edge? Jeez man, make up your mind!
---
&gt;Nothing is safe if you have the right person hunting you.
---
&gt;There is nothing any hunter can do you fly any ship correctly
---
??? Fly safe out there buddy..... o7
---
Translation of Corp name : "My Little Green Botters."
---
Do not forget that the same year that broght us Citadels and Rorqual buffs also gifted us with the big-ole-fuck-you-nerf of T3C-Hunters. Before that your hunter could catch something and you could ping and get a drop squad in 2-3 minutes. Today your Hunter is dead on the same target after 30-45 seconds ...
---
ccp trying to damage controll this with freeish mtc and free skillpoints. they wont trick me tho
---
Manual Warping Intensifies....
---
"It feels like we are in HS and CCP has removed Concord and CODE are doing whatever the fuck they want." 
---
Is this not precisely the point of NullSec? its meant to be lawless and dangerous... 
---
"Its simply gone too far." Has Nullsec not received a series of significant buffs over the years? its safer, easier and more profitable to live there than ever afaik...
---
"so I dont belive in no local in general" yet you say in one of your other posts: "I dont have an issue with no local mind you".
---
As for your last point: Im new to EVE, having started a few weeks before the blackout. I live and operate in nullsec space. im neither doing the fucking or getting fucked - but nolocal has enhanced my experience none the less, purely from a psychological point of view: space feels more dangerous and mysterious than before - without local, i get much more of that 'survival game' feeling: you are tense and constantly paying attention to where threats could come from. it just makes things way more intriguing and enjoyable - for me.
---
as i understand it, the pvp'ers have been feeling fucked over with every expansion and change for a while, i have a feeling you werent so vocal about how it was important that everybody felt fucked over when there were changes that buffed NS PvE/Industry?
---
This isn't a new issue, change you camera mode to fix it. I think it's alt+1/2/3 by default.
---
Nice kill.
---
That Paladin fit tho... whyyyyy?
---
well, the rules of the game have just changed and so the players will have to change to? its like law - if the letter of the law doesnt not correspond with the spirit - should the law not be changed?
---
OK so if its not because of that then what stopped then pvping before? Nothing, absolutely nothing.  All this so called pvp is purely because of them hunting for easy ganks and they bump.into each other on a gate.  And actually that's not a bad thing, thata good if its generating some pvp.  But what happens when you've killed all the bots or miners dont undock anymore? If you say well pvp will continue then OK so why do you need black out.  Because In my old days we did lots of roaming gangs and people killed stuff because we loved doing it.  I've said before eve has moved from pvp focused to PVE focused in the mindset.  
---
Absolutely things need to change but there has to be balance.  If this is permanent then it's going to have dramatic affect on player numbers, markets and economy.
---
Good riddance tbh
---
Ohhhhh yes, come to daddy!!! :D
---
Those pesky exploration skills will finally go UP!
---
Short answer: you can do it.

Long answer: you can do it, but you just won’t.

We were light blue on the past. Now we are on war with No Forks, sadly. They are cool guys. You are going to learn a lot with them and White Sky too.
---
F toThat Paladin. It was short on fuel to the cyno. XD
---
FW has that effect on your sec status. The system is just shitty
---
Also, people dont roam just for ganks.  They look for fights and settle for ganks.
---
&gt; Well I recently got cap hot dropped because I engaged a TEST proteus (not a krab) on a gate but that's another story...
---
Let me guess, you were in test space harassing the locals... 
---
Low sec is where i would suggest for you, don't like super umbrellas... go where they aren't.
---
Got to keep login numbers high so PA overlords don't force return of the local.
---
You say if its permanent... The only way it will pe permanent is of the stats after a give period of time are positive.
---
If they arent CCP will adjust the local accordingly.
---
As far as bots, majority have not yet logged in. They might program a work around soon.
---
As part of my roaming in different corners of EVE i did not bump into 3rd parties too often. Most times it was locals from the region i was roaming.
---
So i'd call that abpositive thing. Clearly locals are not totally put off by it or maybe its just the initial novelty of it. 
---
Or maybe they dont want to PVE for fear of dying.
---
On the flip side though, O came across plenty of myrms, VNI and Gila ratting sp go figure.
---
Lets just wait for the stats after a few weeks of blackout.... that will tell all!
---
&lt;= -2 will get you attacked in .9 and 1.0 systems
---
It's a HTFU post #2,323,625
---
You missed nothing of consequence.
---
I believe that starts today iirc.
---
Yea. It's kind of sad how all these people think botters should just auto-adjust 5 second after the blackout starts. And that fact that they (of course) haven't somehow serves as proof that they were right.
---
I mean, the duration of the blackout hasn't even been confirmed yet. Odds are that most of the botters are just docked and waiting it out, seeing if they actually need to adjust or if they can simply undock again in 2 weeks and continue as usual. - And the ones that are undocking and dying horribly are the same form of idiot that somehow manages to die in Rorquals under the Delve super umbrella.
---
If I were one of those low-lives I certainly wouldn't be wasting time coding solutions to what very well may be a temporary situation. Once it's confirmed to be permanent, sure, I'd do it then. But definitely not now.
---
Covetors have frigate ehp with the signature of a battlecruiser. You can kill them in about 30 seconds in a t1 frigate.
---
The Auto-Pilot CAN be stuck sometimes at a gate at my side too.
---
I didn't try for docking and not this way, but I don't want to take the risk to be honest. AFK can wait few seconds...
---
The only downside to me is that I can't see my friendlies in local, I like to see how many friends I have around me while flying around the home system.
---
I mean, you're not wrong.
---
Wow that's super good to know! Thanks!
---
the argument also applies to the supply of ISK. If money supply contracts, purchasing power per unit of currency goes up. So while the nominal value might be lower, the adjusted value doesnt change so much. 
---
You also reference the fact that you would now have to make strategic choices - how much security do i want or need for this op? do i forgo security and increase my yield but with signifcantly more risk? you can no longer both maximize yield and minimize risk in the same way as you can with local intel.
---
Bye. You 10 rorqs will be missed
---
You are a hero , +Respect .
---
I can actually relate to you on this. I probably have 7-8m sitting in at least 4 locations each. It's also pretty heavy to move in volume as well. So it would be hilarious if it took a freighter to refill the stations.
---
Yup, which is why every time they talk about the 'war against bots' I chuckle. Its less a war and more a propeganda piece, they have to be seen to be closing x bot accounts a quarter or else the plebians might revolt again, but they can't close too many of the sub money will dry up.
---
It would be fun if all -5 pilots' ships would automatically start the self-destruct sequence on undock in high-sec. You either get it done in 2 minutes, or not at all!
---
You don't need to make a strategic choice. The activity simply isn't worth doing.
---
&gt;constantly say that if you want some space there - just get some space or drop structures totally not understand the point that those who are hunting are not interested in taking space.
---
just hunt in lowsec. problem solved.
---
nullsec is for sovholders, not for pvpkrabs
---
If that truly is the case, the bounties can always be increased.
---
I used to triple box Widows in Blood Raiders and Serpentis space. Ran all sites just fine.
---
or you know, just talk with a few alliance mates, send 1 char per system in one constalation and see where the bots are.
---
Come back each day
---
"new".
---
Will I be able to claim all rewards if upgrade to Omega during the last day?
---
What about locking down systems in null which don't have activity, requiring a substantial effort to access the systems again. The system count is too high for the playercount imo. Resources should be balanced better and by resources I mean the economic factors of content: time, effort, complexity, logistics, space, out of game intel, materials, etc. Materials should be easy to get in order to deflate their perceived value, less space to condense content and promote smaller alliances. There are a lot of behind the scenes "unsexy" balance problems imo and these cause difficulty in content generation.
---
u think blackout will last a year lmao
---
I would say the opposite my friend. Without the chance to experience it as a test one is more likely to make a knee jerk reaction. 
---
Anecdotally when I was linked that in discord I immediately cancelled all my subs because I thought after three days local was permanently gone. Now I understand that this is some random fan fiction and that reaction was not necessary. 
---
I understand that from your perspective this is not a big deal but no-local is a very polarising topic.
---
You are doing gods work!
---
It seems like CCP are recycling a number of skins back into the PLEX market every now and then, so it's very possible.
---
It's a reward for one of COSMOS mission chains
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/COSMOS
---
Skillyourself
---
Dont think it was a plex skin tho
---
Oh, great! Thank you so much. I will try these missions.
---
Oy vey!
---
It went up as the mission hub was under trig invasions for a few days.
---
I hope so, Lowsec DED runner btw ...
---
Op is a soft shell attention whore.
---
ahh, in that case then I don't know
---
I have a feeling you might, seeing as that was the case for the last log-in event.
---
As someone who pve´d in all kinds of space (from WHs, to highly frequented lowsec, to highly frequented NPC null to sov null and sov null behind enemy lines) i really don´t get the anom farming in subs is a lot of hassle now angle. It still is moderate, relatively low effort and scalable income. But most of all it´s easily available (!), reliable (!) and scalable (!) income. It´s far from piss poor compared to the amount of effort and the tools you have to comit.
---
Other than that all the complains boil down to is basically "but i want my AFK PvE". Now granted, Anoms are pretty unengaging but you could potentially adjust anom spawns a tad or make them more flexible (extra waves if no cap/scap is on grid or whatever that warp off if a cap/super lands on grid) or change them in ways that reward active player actions (which should be the cause of action when no local sticks).
---
Been doing this with LP farmed faction items for years now, put up order once, maybe react on the first 2 or 3 undercuts, then just leave it. Stack will be gone in max. 2 days completely anyway.
---
Carefull or we wont leave J-space again!
---
Why does this fight the carebears?
---
Wormhole classes usually denote the strengths and rewards of the NPCs that lie inside. So, a solo battlecruiser can do C1-C2 pretty reliably, some battlecruisers can deal with C3, but you're going to want a Battleship. C4 can be done in battleships, or multiple battlecruisers. C5 are done in multiple battleships or capitals and C6 are usually done with capitals with support.
---
For exploration, you're going to want to stick to C1. C2 and C3 since those are the only ones that spawn pirate data sites where you don't get attacked. Alternatively, you can find a nullsec entrance through a wormhole and run data and relic sites there.
---
To know the class of the system, just google its name (which will be J followed by a couple of numbers), it will give you a website with the details of that system.

For some reason the 1st post was removed by mods before DT, it isn't showing for me on newest anymore.

i agree with you, but i also dislike him straight up for backstabbing, refusing to adhear to multiple diplomatic agreements as soon as he feel he dont gain from them anymore even though a timeframe is set on them when made. and ofcause the whole banned for RMT thing...
---
That's a relatively normal pally fit...
---
Oh boy, we were holding autists together and now they gone wild to another games or even worst - out on the street. Fuck
---
She sold out in a couple days too. Glad I got mine early!
---
which is disingenous considering letting bots run rampant will kill the golden goose.
---
Because it encourages people to log in
---
Dude I'm not sure anyone understands you.
---
You don’t even need to select a character to claim these rewards. It doesn’t encourage anything past booting up the account selection screen.
---
Embargo is working \o/
---
So you ever heard of something called washing yourselves ?
---
But I understand, If you have no time to wash yourself its conveiant ...
---
Look we get it. You mutliboxed vni before the change and now that's marginally more dangerous. No need to sperg on every post about it.
---
I was roaming in TEST space looking for a fight... Not harassing anybody, we were 4 guys in destro/cruiser and firstly got chased by 20+ ships and finally got dropped by a cap. I don't complain it was fun, but once again, lol, we were just 4 nearly harmless guys wanting to have fun we didn't even attack a krab. I don't ask for 1v1 at the sun but come on.
---
Yes, I obviously go time to times in low sec but I don't have access to it all the time.
---
&gt;Risk free ganking. . .you might die
---
Dangerous also means that if you go mining/ratting/exploring/etc in a system that's supposed to be dangerous, you might die. That is currently not the case, and that is my problem. There's no longer risk involved in mining the best minerals or killing the best rats. That risk-reward tradeoff that you're supposed to make for getting the better stuff? It's not there, and that's a problem.
---
&gt;Well then maybe. . .going to win
---
Maybe you're right, but someone winning spells the death of the game. Someone won Serenity; Serenity is gone now. EVE can't afford to have someone win, so there need to be mechanics that either prevent it outright or make it extremely difficult to the point that it's not feasible.
---
Pot meet kettle.
---
So are we posting this once a week now?
---
Inversely, the voice of those that like it and enjoy the rhetoric of :lol filthy carebear, quit if you don't like it" is equally louder here. It's a pretty big echo chamber.
---
I was thinking the porpoise for some reason. The covetors died super fast.
---
I honestly can't understand how people actually believe this drivel.
---
And how is a citadel different than a pos in this regard?
---
&gt; CCP has hired economists to study the game quite a few times. I think its time they hired a military historian to help them implement a more fluid, modern type of warfare in their game, instead of the current stagnation. The blackout could be part of rectifying that because it adds fog of war to the game and needs actual interaction from the players to recon and spot movement, but it's just a small part of what could and needs to be done. Or we could just keep playing "castles and trebuchets in space".
---
They should just hire you.
---
Can one really turbodunk a structure with a DPS cap?
---
Be sure to biomass thanks sweetie
---
I mean, you have seen his posting history? It's not retardism... it's willfully seeing only one half of an equation that fits the echo chamber narrative.
---
You're right, it may be permanent
---
oh hello 25k sp
---
Bad guy ! Hope that our next roll will not end up in one of your krab system (again) \\o/
---
Interesting, so there is hope.
---
i think you have the best comment here hands down
---
Doesn't encourage them to undock
---
r/eve for you.
---
Reality is majority of eve subscribers are highsec/lowsec dwellers and are not even affected by this.
---
More so I bet they dont even know its happening.
---
That sounds awful
---
[What do you mean, 'you people'?](https://giphy.com/gifs/star-neogaf-13VSAbTVuYJfLa)

Considering there has been 2 or 3 rounds of nerfs to anom respawn times, that seems as likely as me being the first man on mars.
---
Don't listen to him, he can't do anything about stratios's :D
---
Stratios Ships either come from doing SoE missions, or from drone nexus chips, that can drop from sentient spawns bigger then cruisers. And they are spreaded all over the map in all regions and a bit more in drone regions, which is not where he's living ;)
---
Blackout is why.
---
Ahh, that makes sense. Thanks!
---
True story brah! Heres an upvote!
---
Except for all the people saying they are returning or their hardcore pvp friends are returning.
---
9hrs of work for sub that's worth 15bucks max? sounds shit to me
---
Except I didn't, if you read my posts which you clearly haven't, you'd know I don't Multibox.
---
I don't believe the OP is referring to the blob in his post.  I'm referring to the process of creating your character, training and following the same time gated process I went through back in 2006 when I first started playing EVE, when you actually had to train skills to learn efficiently.  I'm referring to learning the game mechanics, how your ships work, how to aggress and tackle , how to mine, how to rat, and how to run mission properly without incurring loss.  
---
I agree with you the blob is no fun, and right now this doesn't seem to change.  I can guarantee you there are plenty of non null sec activities worthwhile doing.  Will it net you the same rewards?  No, but it is not meant to, and high risk/high reward activities are designed for the experienced players in mind, not the &lt; 1.5 year character who may have even injected their way into bling.
---
Lastly, the black out isn't going to change the cyno blob.  That can be done anywhere - even high sec.  To blame the blackout as exacerbating or perpetuating a problem that has existed for nearly 16 years is a straw man argument.
---
Technically, they're not in Frat alliance.
---
Remember that time CCP actually implemented my stupid suggestion? Remember that time a meme failed to capture the nuance of my proposal which was closer to "a timer like a weapons timer to prevent instant invincible cyno into tethering"?
---
I generally don't bother with people's posting history. I let their individual posts fail on their own shortcomings.
---
This "waaaaaah no local means theyre turning nullsec into wormholes" really does nothing but expose the fact you have no fucking idea how wormholes work. Hint: theres a fucking LOT more to it than just "no local". Throwing that shit out there unironically just gives me the certainty that your opinion is conpletely worthless as you have no fucking idea what you are talking about.
---
Well, a lot of people take contracts like these because they are either bored or desperate, but most of the times the old adage "you get what you pay for" applies.
---
I've seen quite a few low paying customers complaining a couple hours after their contract was accepted. What usually happens is the hauler is moving other, better paying jobs first and he is at the end of the queue, or it was picked up by a newbie or cash strapped pilot who hauled it in a t1 indy and lost it to a gank.
---
These events are getting worse... At least you had to put some effort in the old events, now its just login the your char screen and thats it...
---
You should hop over to the FB page, it's 90 % high sec/wormhole carebears (I am not saying all WH are carebears, just the segment on FB). It's one giant resounding echo chamber and circle jerk where they live vicariously through each other's zkill links of someone not related to them getting a kill on one of the big blocs and them LOLing about big man eating shit. It's hilarious.
---
Please teach me master you're looking so smart !
---
Awwww really sorry that your safe space is in danger.  I for one will truly miss the significant content provided by non combatant insta warping krabs such as yourself.  Please feel free to give me your stuff before you biomass and feel free to add me on Apex Legends.  Tia.
---
Certainly will. Sounds entertaining.
---
when someone first reported a vehement on D scan I actually assumed it was LH's there to obliterate the nags.
---
A cattle prod probably wouldn't even encourage the risk averse to undock
---
15$/hr, damn you're well paid for a burger flipper.
---
Good job :) keep on finding them and cleaning up. Frat space is full of them. Primarily VNI tough
---
More like to the tune of 
---
"yo, i play from time to time, but this is why i can't be bothered to play all the time"
---
but thanks for your input anyway ;)
---
We didn't have numbers in EU or US. Until pretty much right before the vehement died. I was cloaked scouting the entire thing as well as nano kitey fucking around.
---
I tried the invasions a couple of times. More interesting than the incursions as there's somewhat of an element of randomness to them, but still not really that interesting and for the number of people you need for the major conduits the rewards are really quite low.
---
Still though, any pve that isn't anomoly afk drone ratting or high sec mission running is welcome in the game. At least this can be somewhat dangerous and since a big chunk of the rewards are in the loot/salvage its good that players can steal it. Things that involve more players or players competing against is other is good.
---
Makes me wonder what null would be like if rats dropped blue loot rather than giving isk bounties
---
That's the first week or so. More is coming.
---
wouldnt have happened without blackout.
---
I don't think you understand the actual intention of my post.  Just passing along casual observations to people who may be interested
---
If only your posts were delayed for like 100 years.
---
This is how you enjoy your blackout and will be if it's become permanent.
---
with allaince mates like that no wonder he didnt run for CSM 2019
---
username checks out
---
copypasta
---
CCP's desperation is unbecoming.
---
Explains how they became such a super power in 2/3 years.
---
Looks at blackout, looks at comment...
---
Well something was done. And in true eve fashion, it's up to the players now, we're the space police. *woop woop*
---
Sounds like you should be rolling your statics to find some wormholes then, their are the biggest proponents of having "gud fites" our space is our home, you aren't going to get a fair fight by walking into someone's kitchen and then being pissed when they call the police
---
One time, Vily came up to me at Wendys, took a fry off my tray, ate it, looked me in the eyes &amp; said "Nobody's going to believe you."
---
So CCP wants to pip the login and sub stats during the blackout ?? how obvious XD
---
If only you could poke an Semi-dev/game master who are active in the help channels and have them teleport to said bots. If only those game masters could wield the power of the banhammer.
---
He couldn't kill them himself with his Tengu?
---
The alliances don't have the tools do detect if someone is a bot or not.
---
CCP does. Also CCP can ban ppl they know are bots.
---
If someone is not banned by CCP, how can you affirm they are bots ? 
---
What if CCP was trying to find who the bot belongs to and you kicking it prevented CCP from doing so ?
---
same here. I had only one account for years before upgrade for more.  
---
Once you have enough knowlege, isk and SP, you can make a lot of money thanks to multiboxing. you can easily plex at least one account when you know how to do. I never had to pay more than one regular subscription.  
---
Some gameplay will encourage you to have multiple accounts, like flying capitals or living in a wormhole, but that's endgame content.
---
Yes, it has been like that since they introduced this kind of "event?" structure! o/
---
It's highlighting the fact that they often attack solo players in large groups.
---
Yeah, it's better than having to go shoot a rat on your fax alt.
---
This is exactly how I thought this fight went when I looked at the BR.
---
Never not take the bait.
---
Without knowing much, and taking the plates and everything into account, seems like his goal was to be cyno bait but nobody was around to help him, and the warp disruptor would be a way to point something blingy if we showed up in it? I have NO idea why he broke station tether but we kept expecting them to pop a cyno and flood in some support.
---
&gt;where capital ships are the big artillery guns for structure bashing (maybe different damage thresholds and limits for capitals and sub-capitals?) that will be almost useless against sub-caps, battleships are the capital screens and smaller damage dealers, BCs and cruisers are BS screens and general anti-support and destroyers and frigs are the pickets and scouts. Small ships should not be able to take down structures easily, but they should be able to cause chaos. 
---
Isn't that how it was *supposed* to work anyway? Before slowcats, HAW guns and the fighter rework?
---
i managed to fix it by logging off, logging back in,but then it came back, i also fixed it by jumping through gate 3 times and it cleared up but as soon as i changed my camera angle it came back
---
the camera change didnt fix it for me or others in fleet today, i tried ship tree refresh first then the camera change but didnt fix nothing made it worse.
---
Hysterical seeing a CODE coward pretending to big dick.  Y'all are so adorable
---
300 would be enough fuel with Cyno 3 right?

They will for a while. And then they will leave again when they realize there aren't any nice soft targets to prey upon. And we'll be right back to where we were before: the bulk of pvpers being people who hunt the hunters. And those being a tiny number of people.
---
\&gt;not being a volcel 
---
yikes
---
&gt; forcing you to travel with your pve ships
---
Yea. No, nobody's going to do that are they.
---
This is slander. This is violence. This is a microaggression. This is a trope. This is unacceptable. We cannot have toxicity like this at a coalition leader level. It sets a terrible example to our community. I hope Elo takes some time off to consider his words and actions. This is just a game at the end of the day. We cannot have it degenerate into awful mud-slinging. We must all do better. Please Elo, I implore you to make a swift, unabashed apology video. Otherwise we as a community may be forced to ostracize you. This behavior will NOT be taken lightly.

EVE Players yesterday: "Skillpoints don't even matter, what really maters is how good you are at flying you ship. Yes, alpha pilots ARE viable, we promise!"
---
EVE Players today: "yO CCP what the FUCK with all these free SP, it's bullshit and unfair, I played longer!"
---
EVE Players tomorrow: "WHAT. THE. FUCK. CCP. Give me my free SP, I wasn't able to log in and click the button. The rules were like unclear, you OWE ME."
---
Explain smart ass instead of just trolling
---
So what you are saying is... that people would be wise not to base their population and revenue forecasts on a population segment that has already quit once? Say it ain't so!
---
With good enough Cyno skills 300 is enough fuel isn't it?
---
What in the world do you do with 50 accounts, apart from botting?
---
Another salty post on reddit. Stop please, blackout it's probably the best idea from CCP. If it too difficult for you to farm in the Null-sec, move to high-sec or low
---
Every week it will lose a few more pixels off the edges and gather a few more compression artifacts until it's indistinguishable from the regular posts here and then everything will be back to normal.

At least it's a bit more edited

Shit! Pearl Abyss dad is watching our dropping numbers, we need to do smth to hold numbers until our paychecks are signed!!! ;-)

---
I'm guessing you have never seen The Meta Show or seen Mittani tweet?
---
When Athanors/Tataras first came out, I was hoping some mining corps would sell their services to groups that weren't interested in mining - especially in lowsec. Essentially mining the field for them in exchange for a cut, a fee, or something along those lines. This never really ended up happening which I've always felt was a shame.
---
thats kind of the point of his comment.
---
why though? im used to warping or fighting my way off grid when shit actually goes south so i guess i just fail to see the issue with not having local as a reliable intel tool. aligning still works. positioning still works, warp deacceleration is still a thing. targeting delay is still a thing. effective PvEing in anti tackle capable PvP fits with neglectable income cuts is still a thing.  
---
again it boils down to you wanting to be afk 99% of the time or multibox low effort PvE to push your margins into the regions of much more risky and complex PvE activities.
---
He never refit. Warped in without the webs fit. Nestors didn't die until after the fight.
---
Maybe the OP should take the advice of their flair?
---
Hadn't it historically (prior to the last year or two) been 200 mil?
---
This comes form Sisters LP, doesn't it?  I guess someone will be paid more to grind SOE missions.  And they get to do it in HS/LS, so they get local.
---
Cool resubing now
---
My thoughts seeing this:
---
1. Oh nice, some free skill points
---
2. This is probably not really fixing any problems
---
3. OP should have done a better job hiding the character names
---
It's from the [Skilling Spree](https://www.eveonline.com/now/season-of-skills) event. Scroll about half way down the page.
---
I'll never complain about completely free SP gifts.
---
SP for killing NPC is another thing, but I'll bitch about it when the time comes.
---
I whole heartedly agree...  but this post has been written repeatedly for 2 years already.
---
Rewards are ok, the increased risk will lead to deflation and the rewards value will increase
---
You don't see many paladins with trimark rigs. Bastion gives a rep bonus, most people go with rep or damage rigs. He had trimarks with plates and a repper.
---
Or most likely female.
---
not everyone is near npc null tho, having them in your own station would be far better, could also be a ncie isk sink if you have to pay them a wage in the form of a monthly bill that gets bigger the higher the missions you ask them to offer.
---
or as fuel cost with having them installed as a service module.
---
EVE has stopped being Skillpoints Online when they introduced skill injectors. Now it's just ISK Online
---
In fairness to OP, while this is indeed quite late in the game to make this post, their argument was that the blackout wasn't enough and something has to be done about the umbrella.
---
These kind of events are horseshit. Whatever happened to not producing new SP that wasn't earned in game, CCP? That was one of the core tenets that you sold Injectors on. 
---
This is rampant skill inflation, for zero effort, nor interaction.
---
What the hell is wrong with you guys? Skill Points are the only thing that differentiate this game from most others - the non-grinding, time-based earning of them is what makes it okay to not play every hour of the day.
---
Stop doing this, it's ruining the game.
---
That's the sound of the space police!

---
The Chemosh would like a word with you.
---
well some dont, but there are actual decent alliances out there that demand people follow the EULA, Frat does not seem to be one of them.
---
Paladin's a goofy ship that at the end of the day doesn't really have any great fits. He has plates because in the correct pod the repper should repair more than the full base armor HP of the ship. Probably had the correct pod but ripped out the implants before yall killed it. 
---
That warp disruptor is intended to be used on capitals though, I'm guessing he didnt realize he fit the wrong module or it was intentionally slotted to tackle something he was waiting on that would be stabbed... at which point a paladin really is a goofy choice.
---
A deaf corp. No voice comms. 
---
It's extremely doable if you get enough deaf people together.
---
I wonder where Elo shops at
---
&gt;  CCP will never let it drop long term against that peg, to do so would destroy the game as CCP will go bust as everyone would cancel their cash sub and rat for ever to buy it cheaper.
---
Oh no, it's retarded!
---
So here's how this works guy. Player A buys $20US worth of plex. That nets them 500 plex. They put that up on the market and player B buys it for X millions of isk to subscribe their account. CCP Has made a whole $5US extra on this transaction over that person subbing directly with cash.
---
No matter what happens CCP gets their cash for the plex even if you let it moulder in your item hanger. Or even if you put in a cargo can and blow it up. So the only thing that actually matters to them is that people keep buying it (here's a fun logical consequence, should you destroy that plex CCP wins a 2nd time because now they don't have to provide any services that plex entitles it's holder to.) The actual price of it doesn't matter only the volume of it moved.
---
Living in null sec. I have 2 accounts, i realized there would be a lot more ganking because of blackout so i made a plan.
---
I made an armor tanking VNI fit and named it "not a bait vni" for double mindfuck. My alt is flying this and start ratting in a flyby system. Meanwhile my main is stealthed in a tengu right there next to it. So all sorts of ships come by. Maledictions, Hecates, assault frigates, dictors all the usual stuff.
---
The vni gets tackled over and over. I mostly get small gangs of 2-4 and when they are warped in i pick my targets web them down. A lot times they seem to panic so hard when their logi friend is popped that they flee instead of comitting to fights where they VNI could have been killed easily. I made around 600mil on ganker remains. So i was at it again, a mal comes in and tackles the vni. I wait to see what else will come. A sabre and a jackdaw. Vni gets bubbled. I unstealth my tengu and start targeting. Mal tackles tengu instead. I'm webbing the mal at this point. A caracal fleet warps in. 10+. I accept my demise. Caracals target the mal and it is popped. Tengu over and out. My tengu warps to base. On my other monitor i see my vni getting blown to pieces along with the jackdaw and sabre. Thank you random gank squad, i bet it wasn't your intent but you saved my tengu.
---
Yes, I seem to recall Stratios were going for about 220-250 mil isk.
---
Yeah i have adapted. Thanks my 40k ehp / s rep dread. This dread has shot gang 50+ with success; now it kills rat ;/
---
I m more safe now than my full dps carrier before but less isk/hr.
---
ah nice, Im not home yet just at work snooping on hobo.
---
LOL  Take Vexor, farm ISK - buy Stratios. =D
---
It's weird to me that people focus so much on trying to curb proliferation or spread people out or come up with some new cyno inhib mechanics to make supercap umbrellas less effective instead of just... making supers less effective. You know what a subcap umbrella would be? Fucking fantastic.
---
You can't run ancil rigs or you end up wasting cap overrepping to hell with an asklepian set. If the ship is cynobait then trimarks make more sense than nano repairers.
---
No but if I understand you correct the attacker will die cause security comes so fast in high security zones, which makes the zones relatively safe cause nobody wants that to happen, right?
---
Thanks for the link
---
The way he describes it the AP will do nothing but spam dock until you are docked.      
---
I didn't have those problems yet, so i can't say if it works properly under such circumstances.
---
&gt; Wormhole sites move to another hole of the same class.
---
which is relevant for you as a PvEing individual that wants to make sensible amounts of ISK in WH space how exactly?
---
The only conceivable explanation for these while testing the blackout, and hopefully brainstorming how to kill the umbrella, is that they want to sell CCP (or EvE itself) again.
---
This plater is using a QWERTY-keyboard
---
You thought you'd rake in karma with the laziest repost.
---
Good moment to grind SOE missions it seems.
---
Also, (#)NoPoors!
---
It's just 250k SP.
---
I don't get it. Gran as in grandmother?
---
I'm using my new QWERYT-keyboard, got it from CCP.
---
Anyway, I'm from small Pure Blind alliance, and my favourite ratting ship is Ishtar. I can receive 200-400kk bounty from typical farm. If I include profit from escalation, it will be much more. I guess, umbrella not a panacea, you can die from the t3 cruiser fleet, or 60+ fleet of bombers.
---
been playing with one account for 6 years and in fact, most (over 50%) of the players only have one account.
---
One year ago it was also &gt;200 mil yes if you check history
---
Every event its event for crying , CCP see alpha need more free SP for stay in they game because lot of alpha leave the game after 30 Day ( 30 day in alpha = 1M SP) and you cant feel good in the game with only 1 M SP and alpha = F2P so need more testing ship before they buy omega .   
---
Alpha need to begun with 5 M SP ( 2 M SP = 1 month with +5 and remap) so 2 month of SP its nothing for a game who have 15 year no ?
---
I feel like I'm a step behind :D I need to subscribe to text alerts or something :D
---
It's like they get paid for being mad about anything.
---
It was my Tengu and I don't go after cheap targets with it
---
i don'T understand this. if you want to make isk, you'd already do anything BUT null ratting. null ratting was simply the most brain dead way to make isk.
---
&gt; the non-grinding, ... is what makes it okay to not play every hour of the day.
---
I hear what you are saying.... but you aren't grinding these, and everyone has the chance for the same SP.  
---
I might have thought differently once, but since I still dream of a time lots of Rorq and cap skills are wasted when those are nerfed I can't really complain about SP inflation.
---
I hope that trend continues. I still have some lying around.
---
If day one doesn't have at least 100k SP im gonna ask CCP to change the icon because goddamn it sure will cause me anxiety for having less than the smallest ones
---
One time, I saw Vily walking down a street.  He took a few strides out of his way just to kick a puppy.  Then he gave me a thumbs up.   I was so lost.
---
He's single rep fit, he doesn't have to worry about over-repping. Even being cyno bait, just put one 1600 plate withrrp rigs and you're Gucci. On sisi,  I've tanked a cap dread and haw dread at the same time in bastion with a dual rep with a plate and askleps. In game, I tanked a Titan and 3 carriers for 2 minutes and was saved by downtime. Also he has a medium cap booster. And no boosters in cargo like drop or exile. That barghest probably made it a nice, quick death.
---
Let us see if the blackout will have an effect on sub numbers...
---
While the drifters are attacking null....
---
While we throw an event in there that further messes with metrics....
---
Is CCP trying to push the concurrent subs to appease Pearl Abyss here or what else could this be?
---
Throwing everything at the board to see what sticks seems a bit extreme.
---
...how is that gonna happen in case of ticks?
---
I assume this is pasta?
---
I love zip tie cock rings, inexpensive personalized sex toy.
---
Sry. My English is awful, I was asking, didnt see how much he had. XD
---
Like defenseless miners?
---
A couple of things. Haw weapons didn't have independent skills. The skills for cap guns and haw guns are the same. No so refund needed. 
---
Don't forget about fighter application. Firbolgs can still track an interceptor with an mwd moving at 4k m/s. Long range fighters are worse. 
---
The capital system and distance from capital system is a good idea. I also like the station services that can be disabled. That was a good system.
---
Our Doggo :)
---
i dont get it.
---
Dread 8 standing by
---
good question
---
Are you saying I should buy Vexor, to buy stratios, to kill Vexor? That's rude
---
Stealing loot also flags you as a suspect
---
What about cruisers? Can they do the lowest wormholes, C1 and C2?
---
Nullscec are star systems which can be reached through wormholes from everywere (even high sec) but also through normal jumping, though dangerous to reach?
---
It shouldn't take 60 dudes  (who had to form, hunt, and somehow get a drop) to take down one unprepared pilot participating in one of the highest return activities in the game.
---
Because you can roll your static.
---
275k free sp for omega on the 1st day, very generous CCP!
---
If you scroll down further, you can see that CCP doesn't bother to provide information on the Magic 14 and is just referring to the UNI-Wiki page.
---
Honestly CCP, make it more clear/easier for new players to get those skills and some others like (Advanced) Weapon Upgrades, it makes it easier for old players as well to provide a fit to new players without going through 10 iterations of "I am missing PG/CPU/both"
---
"We don't have numbers in EUTZ, or USTZ, or AUTZ, or Russian Timer, or when it's dark outside, and defenitly not between monday and sunday." :P
---
It forces the Carebear to sub/log in numbers increase so CCP wins in the eyes of the ones who matter highest and in the heart of the pvper &lt;3
---
MASTICATION, WHILE EATING
---
Is this the new r/eve shitcomment format? Maybe wait until he's done it for 30 days and THEN complain about it
---
Oh god I just took a look at your post history.
---
Because with blackout seeing them coming becomes more difficult virtually removing the option to warp out.
---
Any competent hunter will eat a ratting ship for breakfast, which leaves you with the dice roll of ec300s to save yourself.
---
Lots more interruptions, less options to avoid having to replace your ship. It makes the whole activity less worth while.
---
Can't wait for all the dumb ones to finally leave for good, so we can have the "test" become "default".
---
You're right. Everyone can get these but that isn't the point I'm trying to make. It's flooding the economy with unearned SP. Look at it this way, a skill injector is just shy of 1bn. Each day, CCP are giving every single person 150mil ISK each. For nothing.
---
Even if you ignore the impact of how beneficial this is to older players who suffer from injector returns, that's a hell of a lot of stuff to be dumping into the economy.
---
This is the wrong approach to rewards, and just heightens my feelings that CCP don't want anything but rorquals and supers online because that is stable and boring and keeps people subbed.
---
Events should give people a reason to play the game. A reward worth getting, and even better, a reward worth fighting over. This is not it.
---
I think we may be agreeing with each other my point is that PLEX is worth money they wish to shift PLEX to maintain or improve the cash flow and encourage players to sell it for ISK thus ISK has a value against PLEX which has a value against money. CCP don't care what you do with the PLEX they just want to sell it, if you use it to buy services say a flash new skin then they are happy with that said skin is worthless and you have removed a PLEX from the game allowing CCP to sell another one to some other Guy . If we extend this to the idea that PLEX is in freefall they will not sell it why would anyone buy something that is near worthless in game so they will move to support the PLEX market to return it to a more desirable  level.
---
What the fuck ccp I'm literally waiting to get into surgery right now that's gonna leave me in the hospital for 3 days.
---
You can always join Bombers Bar as variant, the can bring 100+ dudes with all support.
---
I am curious - how does it come from the drone nexus chip.  Actual question, but the language did make me wonder  how if the Chip fits in you cargo it would then give birth to a whole cruiser, even a packaged one.  
---
Though I guess it could give birth to a BPC.
---
sp loss is still a stupid fucking mechanic
---
Actually when all people buying subs would switch to plexing their accounts CCP would make more money. The plex have to be bought for a higher price and are used up. So the only thing stopping plex from dropping to 1isk is supply and demand
---
This is straight out of the Pearl Abyss textbook - Black Desert has daily login rewards like that last for 30 days, and rest every 30 days. They are usually significant enough that you do want to collect them.
---
One time, Wendys came up to me at fry, took a tray off my  "Nobody's going to believe you." , ate it, looked me in the eyes &amp; said Vily
---
Why would you do that?
---
 nice try botter
---
The url says r/eve but you're actually at r/pasta.
---
I don t think black out is an bad idea. I just think it is not enough
---
You're not wrong
---
Agreed... Gila and Myrms are now the ratting OP.  I believe some are no even pvp fitting their ships.
---
Elo is in charge of Frat?
---
tbh my comment was a joke too
---
It's not fraternity it's renters....
---
Reading is hard; he said the porpoise took 2 minutes, not the covetors.
---
Damn, looks like I forgot my daily glass of kool-aid from the Imperial propaganda machine, my bad. 
---
Mate, undock in your home region and fly around - compare it to what it was a month ago. It's dead. Rorquals mining with mining drone IIs, thannies too scared to undock, and rightly so. DCPI and unaligned covert ships roaming freely and waiting in every pocket. Goons taking to the forums en masse to supply tears and screeching. Your organization may be a masterpiece of social engineering, but ain't nothing good about these changes for you :)
---
Reading the topic is hard; he edited the post to make more sense.
---
oh rip
---
Why is this a thing? Soon enough they will be selling sp
---
i am a pvper buying plex. i like rising prices. 1. makes many activites profitable again without heavily multiboyxing 2. loss is meaningless nowadays indays of overpdoruction and free falling mineral prices.
---
the problem you describe is actually a solution :)
---
i think its hilarious u kids talking shit about vily . u wouldnt say this shit to him at lan, hes jacked. not only that but he wears the freshest clothes, eats at the chillest restaurants and hangs out with the hottest dudes. yall are pathetic lol
---
Well at least you admitted it.
---
Far better ending for sure.
---
Elo is a coalition leader???
---
Null hunting was ringing each time a bit more like: Cache, D-scanning, 5VNI, 2 on Haven RXD, warping and arriving on grid to contemplate Xian Si and Xian Qi's VNI warping off to some planet. A last d-scan to confirm the inevitable: 5°, 5 VNI and a f\*\*\*ing Minmatar Control Tower. Another day, another region, Tenerifis, pilots are Poltov Tri and Poltov Sem, but the outcome wouldn’t differ. 
---
Actually; it would be the same on every bit of that damned blue donut. Pilot's name change, but can spam “V” all day long, Fun is nowhere to be seen.
---
I can’t pretend being a skilled intie but when you jump on a system in which every ratters had start recalling its drones and aligning even before the region change animation ends, I think it doesn’t matter how good you are.  You just can’t.
---
Saturday arrives, nothing planned but this, we’ve talked about the black out all week long, weather is sunny, but it’s hopes that are shining. We’ll go out another day; it’s time to see if it makes a difference. We gather some cruisers and some bros. Small roam, never seen so many shuttles staying still. Seems that while some Krabbies are too busy whining, some others already adapt and keep printing ISK. 
---
Back to our hole, disappointed but not down, let’s change strategy. We dock the cruisers; get the rolling team out: we need a new hole. Astero and Stratios bros open the way, I’m flying a brand new Exequror Navy, we expect some big catch, might need high damage, so I made the investment. This would be Esoteria, Test’s place; we are waiting on J-Space....
---
We didn’t wait long, it's a BINGO! Ishtar on grid! Discord's on, wait ... "Approaching" ... \*heart rate increasing\* ... "Soon! Jump, stay cloaked" ... "Go Go Warp! Pointed!" Pilot tries to resist, abandoned drones, launching some EC-600 or EC-900 but that won’t make a big difference. We arrived on grid, “Webbed scrammed!” this one is facing its faith, he is lost.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77786405/
---
Some shuttles wouldn’t have helped this one, only d-scan and checking the new signatures would have.
---
Already replaced? And what? Didn't expect to bring TEST down chasing some ratters, but at least, get some fun! And sorry for P(oor) TOMMY, it might be a Goon or a Frat tomorrow, I don’t care, I’m sure that no matter the region, the ratter will never be blue !
---
In game name : Raistlyn Newert
---
Yes my point is exactly that if everyone switches to PLEX to sub CCP will not make any money unless people buy the plex to sell and if it is worthless why will they buy it consequently CCP will not allow the market to fall through the floor as it directly impacts the cash price of PLEX.
---
what about wow classic?
---
Market penny monkey disagrees.
---
The roaming meta is shifting towards cloaky gangs due to the blackout.
---
This seems very black desert like....
---
For you, yeah it seems hard.
---
yeah those great targets that don'T shoot back and if they do they don't know what they are doing. i'd rather have them gone and have a real fight against skilled pilots
---
I'm surprised they don't have a button you can press in the fittings window that appears whenever a fit is short of powergrid or cpu that shows the skills that raise it. Can even have an open in market to easy buy along with skill injectors to get them to 5 right away.
---
It's safer to reach them through wormholes since you don't have to use gates, which are often camped. With the blackout, null is not as safe as it used to be, but it's still pretty safe to explore. At least, all the relic and data sites that you find, you will be able to hack without any NPC attacking you.
---
Here's a guide for all wormhole sites, and the DPS and Neut that they do: [Rykki's Guide to Wormhole PVE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17cNu8hxqJKqkkPnhDlIuJY-IT6ps7kTNCd3BEz0Bvqs/pubhtml#).
---
You can probably deal with C1s in a cruiser, but C2s are out of your reach, unless you have really good skills and are willing to bling it a little. A Passive Fit Drake battlecruiser will do C1-C2 pretty comfortably with alright skills and C3 with good skills. It's usually the recommended ship for low-class wormhole PvE. The Raven battleship is the Drake's big brother and can also deal pretty easily with these sites. Just watch out for sleeper Relic and Data site, they're usually harder than combat site (usually 1 class higher than normal).
---
idgi... "gran" as in "grandmother"?
---
Unsure if woosh or if im being wooshed
---
Elo joined Frat after his "anti bot" campaign.
---
Some do, better ones kick them because they don't want to condone botting and legitimately just want the game in a healthier place.
---
I ordered unsalted fries by mistake.
---
Yes. Just redeemed my 300.000 SP
---
so, nothing of value was lost. have a nice day 7o
---
There are maybe 8 of us still alive in Eve that get this.
---
good :)
---
Whoop whoop
---
exactly my point
---
Uh, what? We have an entire alliance doing this shit successfully every night. Stop telling newbros to inject supers or uninstall, I have been reading some of your sockpuppeting.
---
Overheard in TEST High Command channel after the stratop:
---
“He got me,” Vily said of Elo's dunk over him. "That f***ing Elo boomed me."
---
Vily added, “He’s so good,” repeating it four times.
---
Vily then said he wanted to add Elo to the list of FCs he works out with this summer.
---
All the worker bees are female
---
I have to agree here.
---
Besides living in a wormhole, i do sites in nullsec, being part of basically just one system, i don't have cover by anything or anyone, then by myself pretty much. Directly front up, there is no necessity for me to rat in a VNI, i do have other methods to create income, but i occasionally did rat in a VNI.
---
So from a little-man-in-nullsec point of view, the shaking up in nullsec, definitly worked. Me beeing primarily a PvP pilot, i love it. Me from time to time doing VNI sites, i see it as a permanent threat. There could be someone in space anytime, or never. 
---
I experienced that a couple days ago, being in a normally empty system, having a proteus on d suddenly, 5min later a tengu, searching for sites, a loki doing a site, an astero searching probably for relic sites. There can be alot of traffic, where there was none. Which is great.
---
So doing a site in a VNI under the 20m tick thing, knowing you won't see cloakys coming, you won't see recons coming and you will most definitly see ceptors coming, but probably too late when hitting the d-scan button, it's pretty simple work ... and for me not worth it, as for the 20min having my eyes NOT moving away from the screen even for a slight second, is the best i can do to avoid getting caught, although a stealthbomber will tackle me for sure, before i can even hit the warp button.
---
So i can understand when people are not willing to rat under the usual way, unless they feel protected, which can only be done by several more people around.
---
I also understand, that it will normalize in terms of hunters will go back to their normal hunting schedule, as the first week was simply something else, so risk will probably go down a bit compared to what it is right now.
---
And there will be people going afk-rat, taking the risk and they will be successful, as there will be tons of systems unaffected of higher traffic, so they will feel no difference at the end of the day.
---
But there will be for sure people who were at least half aware of their surroundings and will be permanently farmed now, and i can understand that after losing a third VNI at the same day, you might think about something else to make ISK and stomp doing sites into the ground.
---
So unfortunately i don't wanna simply say "give rats higher bounty", because it changes everything everywhere ... and i actually don't have a good solution, but for really small corps who wanna be part of nullsec, but don't wanna be pets or renters, but wanna live the little independent lives, the current situation is not good in risk/reward doing anomalies.
---
Man that comeback must have taken all your mental capacity; careful not to strain yourself.
---
It's the circle of life.
---
The big icon is 250K SP.
---
it encourages CCP marketing department to post new "highest login numbers since 2k X" tho, it's all about the login numbers
---
What backstab?
---
OP straight up copied a story about Chevy Chase doing a sight gag as Fletch in a grocery store...
---
I'm glad someone else caught on. 
---
Interestingly, there's another post about Fraternity botting in this subreddit today and this copy/pasta seems to fit the mould...
---
The reason why this story is funny is because Chevy Chase is original.
---
all it does is make people open up the character screen, click a button "Claim Reward" then log off...
---
Dats da sound o da space beast!
---
This already exists in a certain form, it's called escalations.
---
Dont like it, if everything is the same, nothing has value.
---
Peak happened. Two major events happened in 2013:
---
* Test Co Vs Goon war aka (Fountain War)
---
* Halloween War (And the B-R blood bath)
---
Two major takeaways from these wars:
---
* EvE war is not fun. It's grindy and overall 100% Big icelandick gay.
---
* Big battles like B-R are not fun. Big battles like that are the end game. The end game is not fun. 21 hours of not being able to shoot your guns. is. not. fun.
---
I think a lot of players realized one of the two, and just up and left. It's worth noting that in 2011 was incarna which gave us walking in stations, and the summer of rage. Player count dipped *hard* in 2012 mostly likely because of that. They resubbed in 2013 for these wars.
---
EvE's problem can be broken down into a series of problems:
---
1. Large organizations, while good for the initial retention for players, lead to large battles of attrition with players being their primary ammunition. Wars are paced in a way that the players are not in control, timers are. ***A problem which CCP has exacerbated with citadels.***
---
2. Conversely EvE is too small. &lt;= I keep trying to explain this one but no one listens.
---
3. Hilmar is a dick butt.
---
pretty much...
---
r/evetech may help.
---
Ouch, blueballing and not taking the fight is the new fun
---
The Incursion DLC brought me back (well, the free log-in schwag in the lead up, really)... 
---
Haven't seriously played since 2012 (I was heavy from 2003-2009).  Tried again in 2015 and 2017, but hated the state of the game.
---
This... this is different.  This is like old EVE.  This is good.
---
Ha! Didn't know this was posted in r/Eve. This is great!
---
Another garbage event back to back. I want to play for my rewards.
---
It's an old copypasta, sir, but it checks out
---
Shhh. They are busy thinking about bookmarks. Pls no disturb.
---
yes but make them warpable, have more tackle frigates and not only reward isk but certain items or even Minerals that have to be hauled back or somethink. Anythink that makes you more likely to lose your stuff
---
oh sweet summer child believing literally anything CCP says. remember when CCP said there would be no enchanting to boost damage? a few months later we got Abyssal damage mods...
---
Amazed he could find a puppy that was alone and wasn't blue to tapi. I bet his 50 "mates" giggled and ree'd with pleasure.
---
And again, my dude, we aren't talking about THE CHANGE.  We're talking about the IMPACT of the change and just like you said right now "fucks with players and doesn't make alliances blink".  
---
You implied that all alliances are having the same problem, I said they aren't, and players can go find a new alliance.
---
Holy shit, you can't even follow what you say, yourself.  lol
---
If I'm thick, you're fucking solid.
---
Glad we could help. Nice job. I agree with you, this is the kind of place that newbros should be in eve. Frankly I'm only in Dreddit because we do small gang every night. The siren song of lowsec keeps calling me.
---
It is classic people vs machines, embrace it and kill the dirty bots.
---
you mean 50m/h.   
---
and honestly it depends on what mission your getting, loot, and ship.
---
I too am big fagoot

---
Hmmm, its more of a cost–benefit analysis.
---
You see one single Tornado Battlecruiser with fitting and ammunition for three volleys costs about 80mil ISK. You try to fit it rather cheaply so you don't tank up and fill your Artys all the way.
---
Usually those instahlocker guys who want to kill you are in for the profit alone, if you're in a cheap ship and have no valuable cargo they leave you be and don't give a fuck.
---
That changes too depending on what ship you're in. If you sit in a blinged out Marauder fitted with Officer type modules wich go for several billion a pop you will get killed just for your shiny killmail to upload on zkill.
---
Cloaky Haulers can't be affected by Cargo Scanner so they often times get shot just to crack open the nut and see whats inside, so they automatically draw unwanted attention towards them. Often times you die in a Cloaky Hauler without even having any cargo at all, you're completely empty on your way home just to get blapped because they assume you're full and since they can't check you just die. Its a gamble for them you see ~
---
In highsec you won't get shot at if you're cheap fitted or in a combat vessel of some sorts, your modules only have a 50% chance to drop on destruction of your ship so to make profit that way they need to calculate all that and estimate if its worth shooting you or not. Also they usually won't move much and seek active targets, those guys are superlazy and usually only sit at tradehubs and inbetween them on traderoutes in +0.5 systems at the in or out gates.
---
If you're sitting in high in a Mining Barge you also might get shot at just for fun, so if you really want to mine in high and be a peasant ^yo fcking scrub choose a Procurer and never go for Retriever or Covetor; also fit proper tank!
---
&gt;When you can spam D-scan without killing your left indexfinger
---
The future is here
---
Ok so what does that SQL statement look like? Because:
---
SELECT \* FROM BOTS WHERE isActive = true 
---
Probably isn't in their database.
---
inb4: Hurr Durr I'm a DBA, I know the scripts.
---
# This is why we can't multibox anymore.
---
They are having the same problem. Blackout.
---
The effect is the same, it's the same problem.
---
This is actually easy to fix.            
---
Remove (or) heavily nerf all escalations - increase a bit spawn of combat anomalies.       
---
1. Combats have to be done in subcaps             
---
2. In most of them you cannot light a cyno to get help           
---
3. You can do combats even if this is not your space
---
I'm never able to leave this game, I leave for 3 days and an event starts
---
As a 258 millon SP char I approve of this product and/or service
---
So like at work .....
---
I agree on first segment...however, we have seen that there is a low number of 9/10 DED being run in sov null in comparison to any other DED being available for the most part people LF a path of least resistance - it's common in a human nature. So you only would run them atm if u seek challenge, most of the ppl don't because the incentive = reward is too small in comparison to 10/10 or 6/10 DED which are done not only two times faster but also yield higher profits. Since the nerve not being able to run stage I and stage II 9/10 DED with a carrier I only run a few of them from time to time due time involvement. At this point you have to redo pretty much half of the DED sites in null otherwise see my argument above. 
---
About the last segment: if any carebear don't even bother when their ship dies I assume any cov ops just keep sticking to a single system without leaving it - cause human nature - you get easy targets why should you moving? At this point I feel the pvp cause being not challenging enough or being anywhere near adventure venture.
---
Generally pre blackout I'd say risk / reward system had it's flaws but a least in some way it was balanced. Nowadays risk of losing a subcapital or bad fit ship went straight up, reward stayed the same. So I have my doubts that increasing the reward significantly is a solution. The moment you increase the reward I guess wh's would also  become less compelling.
---
Yeah, loads of examples out there: https://www.google.com/search?q=infetterence
---
No one would do that. It's too much hassle for too little reward. It's basically just forcing people to fly pve ships around the map as content for pvpers. If you want to kill ratting ships you need to go out and find them, not the other way around.
---
Singing...
---
Local's lying empty before my eyes
---
And I'm Krabbing while watching Netflix
---
Suddenly, my sleep turns into fright
---
Far away, from the keepstar
---
Don't hesitate,
---
'Cause this ganktard won't wait
---
Ooh this blackout is so ga-ay
---
I wanna unsub and hide away,
---
I gonna whine about night and day
---
Wait, they already have monkeys able to interact with computers using it... maybe this is bots 2.0, now with d-scan?!
---
I was playing stellaris when suddenly my discord blew up "get on comms." When I jumped on my Corp had already semi formed a dread drop and needed a cyno. Luckily I had an alt two jumps away from what was apparently an init small gang that had tackled some brave haw dreads. They had no where near the dps to break them and one guy with them reached out to us. My Corp has been looking to use dreads in more independent drops from the 1000 man cap blob for about a year now and were happy to help. So we jump cloned, jumped in 4x dreads and a carrier. Once dead we found out a few people didn't have cap charges or a cloak and had to gate home. We yolo'd with only a bifrost to clear tackle from us. The single sabre following us for some reason only launched one bubble which was easily booshed away. Thanks to blackout and shitty Intel from test n brave we managed to gate out after getting involved in some small gang narrowly missing a counter drop formed by test (they were 30-60 seconds from dropping us)
---
Dude, it was a Tuesday in July, after they did Blackout (with quite a lot of pve-ers going afk for a while).
---
Granted, the #'s are not what they used to be, but it's not that bad.
---
Was charged twice once, one ticket to support solved everything.
---
They already did. See the starter pack.
---
Have you talked to CCP?      
---
A. They will fix your issue, by canceling doubled sub            
---
B. Potentially with your help find out what happened and if this was on their side ^(and probably it was) fix the issue
---
Does that mean that most of the goons are actually virgin females and only Mittens had sex once and now lays eggs daily to produce thousands of new goons? No wonder he doesn't play the game, too busy shitting out those eggs...
---
Ok there are 3 different chips ... 
---
Rogue Drone 46-X Nexus Chip, Rogue Drone 43-X Nexus Chip and Rogue Drone 42-X Nexus Chip
---
One is for astero, one for stratios, one is for nestor.
---
As said, they can drop from sentient spawns.
---
When you have aquired one, you go into a SoE-station, where you can retrieve LP's (so from an SoE LP-store). And there you can exchange it to a bpc.
---
And then you can build it. :)
---
Do you even have anything left to train?
---
Boy do I have good news for you
---
They're doing SP for shooting Triglavians soon.
---
Frat force their bots to their renters.
---
Bam!
---
100% not Frat gais.
---
Dotlan won’t show you info on miners anyway
---
This is depressing.
---
No, they aren't having the same problem.  They are all IMPACTED by the same CAUSE - but they aren't having the same fucking problem.  Corps are handling this differently, irrelevant of size.  If one corp is taking this poorly, I can find you a half dozen who aren't -- including posts from GSF and PH pilots.
---
So, no - they AREN'T all having the same problem (what we're talking about) due to the change (which we aren't talking about, because there's no debate the 'change' happend).
---
That was the point of my disagreement with your statements.
---
Thankfully not everyone is a jaded bittervet who has no use for 500mil SP. Players who are on the fence because of long training times will probably appreciate this and log in to see what they can put their free SP into.
---
This. I haven't actively played for more than half a year and my accounts are all alpha status right now, but whenever I notice that such a login event is going on, I'll make a small effort to grab the skill points so that if I decide to start again, I have a decent chunk of SP to splurge on whatever I feel like doing at that point.
---
&gt;Bot writers haven't written new code and rolled it out to every botter out there over a single weekend
---
Not to mention: bot writers didn't bother writing new code for what may just be a temporary event
---
When ratting in a subcap any umbrella isn't particularly useful. A tackled subcap ratting ship dies too fast to really do anything about it. That's why it's done in cheap ships. That's why people use the vni over the ishtar, or rattlesnake etc.
---
If they weren’t concerned about player population then /u/ccp would let blackout undisturbed for a month to generate a base line from previous years for comparison. 
---
Instead the next week is get your free skill goo if you even think about logging in. While I have not checked the data for this week. I heard that eve is roughly down 3k people per day from the weekend.
---
The original version of that story is not Chevy Chase, if that's what you're trying to say.
---
Thanks for the heads up!
---
How long does a gate last in nullsec? Exactly how many ships can fit through the gate before it collapses? Does the gate even still go to the same place as it did yesterday?
---
Prepare to bitch in a week cause that's the next half of the event
---
I opened a ticket last night - still waiting though.
---
At all times there is fry. I am a tray. Nobody looked me in the eyes. "Vily ate it."
---
Hmm I do have a spare carrier laying around :O might be a plan for now!
---
Plenty, although these days its more about satisfying my OCD and finishing off whole skill groups.  Recently finished all gunnery to lvl 5.
---
Only issue is CCP keep adding new skills into the group I've just finished.  I'm sure they are watching my skill queue....
---
*incel cringetard*
---
perhaps then ratting like this should be nerfed. I saw a graph the other day that showed the PvE kills had dramatically increased over the past few years:

Perhaps this is a sign that the activity was far too profitable relative to the risks/other downsides?
---
Yea give it a few days.  If the site is glitching the ticket queue is probably quite long.

"It's exactly the same as the character bazaar"
---
They so clearly are having the same problem, they're all reacting in the same way. Turtle up under an umbrella. All employing an identical solution to an identical problem.
---
Just be happy they never charged for shipping and handling!
---
PANIC mod, fighters applying almost perfectly to frigs, instalocking carriers, ansiblex jump bridges. There's just a few of the pretty huge meta-shifting changes in favour of the krabs. Now they're starting to dial it back and make space a bit more dangerous again. Adapt or die.
---
&gt; They so clearly are having the same problem, they're all reacting in the same way.
---
Holy fuck you're an oblivious idiot.
---
thats why you have to increase the reward by a lot then people would do it
---
Sure, if you don't want anyone doing it these changes are great.
---
Just remember if nobody's doing anomalies that's a chunk of players not undocking in null to do stuff. They'll either have quit or moved to other areas of space.
---
Eh, but it _will_ show where ADMs aren't. While ADMs aren't particularly difficult to raise, a negative on that allows you to strike it off the List Of Places To Check.

Hope so. I consider eve online as unique and outstanding project and worry about its future. The game extremely need some fresh air to match up to date reality and attract new players. In my eyes it transforms from unique mmorpg into some kind of "old players close club" with no income of fresh blood.

Learn about them first, as IIRC COSMOS missions can only be failed once. Ever.

I was only nine years old. I loved Elo so much, I had all the merchandise and movies. I'd pray to Elo every night before I go to bed, thanking for the life I've been given. "Elo is love", I would say, "Elo is life". My dad hears me and calls me a faggot. I knew he was just jealous for my devotion to Elo. I called him a cunt. He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep. I'm crying now and my face hurts. I lay in bed and it's really cold. A warmth is moving towards me. I feel something touch me. It's Elo. I'm so happy. He whispers in my ear, "We don't bot". He grabs me with his powerful man hands, and puts me on my hands and knees. I spread my ass-cheeks for Elo. He penetrates my butthole. It hurts so much, but I do it for Elo. I can feel my butt tearing as my eyes start to water. I push against his force. I want to please Elo. He roars a mighty roar, as he fills my butt with his love. My dad walks in. Elo looks him straight in the eye, and says, "fuck blue doughnuts". Elo leaves through my window. Elo is love. Elo is life.﻿
---
Yup. I do, and I focus almost entirely on small gang pvp. Best playstyle, just sayin.

lol... you keep repeating the same shit as if it's going to make me change my mind, and I'm the jibbering fool?
---
Yes.  I did say that.  Which fits exactly into what I was saying above, that ALL CORPS ARE NOT BEHAVING THE SAME WAY.  If the corp your in is taking this hard, fucking go find one that isn't.
---
Not sure why this concept is so hard for you to understand, but maybe pull your head out of your ass long enough to look around reddit, and read other players experiences.
---
or, keep repeating the same stupid shit, as if it'll suddenly change.  lol
---
they did say they were taking more stuff from alphas
---
Full aware of that, that's why I said it.
---
Spoiler alert: skillspoints eventually get sold on the cash shop in unlimited amounts

Damn, I didn't know that worked like that.

lol really, that guy is so toxic for the game, should have stayed a low tier lawyer
---
Region with no umbrella, and now no local to use to protect subcaps.
---
Even if it wasn't bots, you'd likely see a similar response from actual players that don't have an umbrella to shelter under.
---
no clue but this + the vni nerf is a great start
---
too casual
---
"So clearly".  Dude, with your head so far up your ass, the only thing you can see "clearly" is the slow, methodical blink of the "waiting for input" prompt in your empty fucking head.

this would be a huge QOL improvement for novice players, and even some vets.

How serendipitous that this coincides with blackout.

This was announced at EVE North
---
Were these the carrier threads on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th dps nerf to carriers?  
---
Were these the carrier threads on the 1st, 2nd of 3rd application nerf to carriers?  
---
Were these the carrier threads on the nerf to missile volley?  
---
Were these the carrier threads about nerfs to the NSA becoming a self scramming module?    
---
Were these the carrier threads iteration 1st, 2nd or 3rd tuning to aggro to specifically target and shoot fighters?  
---
-Which one of those countless hundreds of threads included someone other than the small gang/solo players LOLing and telling said carrier pilots to HTFU and eat the changes? I think you might not be honestly recalling all of those happy fun time threads where said population was vigorously told to eat shit.
---
Removed by mods? Please explain?
---
HTFU
---
Doesn't help that Goonies are boycotting for "the sake of the game".
---
Is.. INIT.. a cylon?
---
I disagree. Giving people the power to quickly specialize into what they want to do is a good thing. The less time a new player spends spinning their shiny new toy in station, unable to undock it, the better.
---
IMHO, remove skills altogether!
---
yeah i like how fast ccp are to change stuff now, 2-3 years ago it was a long wait just for small changes to hit tq
---
It's a trial account, deal with it.
---
Marketing lied to you.
---
Jeezus, dude!
---
And the poor guy hasn't even discovered pyfa yet.
---
Boycotting... Deklein?
---
"He got me. That f***ing Billy boomed me."
---
What are they doing now exactly? For what I've been reading most goons are pretty happy with the blackout and enjoying the situation as the rest of us. I mean, they are far better prepared for it than anyone else.
---
Those complaining are krabs, and those don't really have a banner (even if they use one the get access to krabbing areas).
---
Apparently it stops actual players from logging in as well.
---
o7 to the capital pilots for bringing out heavy equipment on the first night of the blackout
---
Good comments in the video Carlos, thanks for editing and posting.
---
Well, i don't know, considering [i cut and put the EVE shit behind the guy in photoshop this morning](https://i.imgur.com/6K5NSRb.mp4).. this is only the first time this has been posted to my knowledge.

I think you only get 3 months to redeem them, just worth knowing.
---
they said at the last event in the Q&amp;A that alphas had to much and they were scaling it back and there is no vni Nerf  they didnt do it they just did the black out and everyone with a brain stopped using them
---
Love the cherry picked evidence. Keep up the good work.
---
Oh no, I think this is great, actually/
---
I just wanted to drop a *Bioshock* ref ‘cuz I’m a dork
---
I'd rather have the occasional skill giveaways than tradeable skill injectors. Having both is what makes it a disaster. Remember when we paid to play the game, and game mechanics weren't determined by what would make CCP the most money on the side? Pepperidge Farm Remembers.
---
well the vni nerf is on hoboleak too so soon™
---
Gallente Cruiser bonuses (per skill level):
---
    10% bonus to Drone hitpoints, damage, and tracking speed
---
    10% bonus to Medium Hybrid Turret damage and tracking speed
---
    7.5% bonus to Armor Repairer amount
---
Agreed.  CCP could wipe out every botter in less than a second if they really wanted to, but the revenue would  suffer.  So they poke at the botters every once in a while to show how unhappy CCP is.... but really not unhappy enough to stop the PLEX purchases.
---
Yeah, you already said that, dumbass.  Like, three times now.
---
Keep doubling down, it doesn't make you look wrong, or stupid, at all!  lol
---
So.. who are you gonna Ramsay with this opportunity for the contents? CCP loves you Boltons, you know it.
---
Someone called this last week...interesting
---
Stat padding that's all..
---
Thats more a "stream of consciousness" snipe though.
---
Yeah, I redeem them immediately (or all at once after the event). Once redeemed, the SP just becomes unallocated SP on your character sheet (just like when use an injector).
---
Not in Deklein tho. Look at the geography/jump ranges.
---
Who knew the secret to taking down goons was a ton of smoke
---
We need a mobile app for this man
---
Somebody call the waahhmbulance
---
So we think skill injector pricing will drop?
---
What's that got to so with anything about this subject? 
---
Secondly all those  have been nerfed and nerfed multiple times.  Rorqs got nerfed lots, fighters and carriers got nerfed bad both the fighter tracking and npcs  attacking them and then the fact you can dock in a citadel with NSA active and you cant warp and now blackout. What more.nerfs do.you want?? 
---
The only reason space isnt dangerous because youre all tooa lazy to go pvp.. simple fact nothing more... I mean I've seen a small gate camp next to busy null systems and yet no one does anything its ridiculous
---
Let's get something perfectly clear here.  People.keep going on about the fucking sandbox.  There is and never was anything stopping people.forming a nice roaming gang and meeting another nice roaming gang and shooting each other in the face.  Local never ever stop that.  What stopped it was the player mindset.
---
What's made pvp shit is cynos and caps... the fact that any ship can fit a cyno and instajump a capital fleet is beyond stupid.
---
Only specialised ships should be able to light cynos and they should be a delay in lighting to jumping.  People may the  engage more..but I have seen may fights abandon because says it a NC. Pilot and automatically people.assume cyno  bait.  Let's leave it.
---
Fucking perfect.  I'll hit your channel up when I log in next, and you guys can see if I'm worthy or shit.  :D

Before umbrellas alliances would send their own fleets out to kill roamers and blops gangs in their space.
---
Would live it as long as it isn't like the one we have now that sends a million notifications because each character gets their own notification.

Hey u forgot about the notification spam when u have no skills in ur queue XD
---
Wooshception
---
No, you haven't.
---
Because they are all reacting in the same way.
---
Honestly, I'd send them something in the help system. The GMs might take pity on you and give you a few extra days or just grant the SP directly. Doesn't hurt to ask.
---
Quick, someone tell the Americans!
---
Out of E3UY they have all their caps and such they can drop on most of Deklein except for the TXME pipe and below.

Yeah, the Triglavian embargo on the SOE mission hub.
---
/u/presentfarmer
---
First order of business when starting the game: it will toss you into a string of tutorials which will teach you a few different aspects of the game. 
---
One of the first things to do, is to go to the social tab on the left side “neocom” (the left hand bar with all the menu’s) and click on chat channels. Join a chat channel called z-s overview. 
---
Click each of the layouts in that chat channel starting with core and then grab all the packs, then 1 of the layout packs. What this will do is improve your Overview (the big panel on the right hand side). The overview holds all in space content for you. It’s the main interface for you to attack another player, an NPC or interact with things like gates. 
---
After completing the tutorial, i would recommend looking into and joining one of these player corporations. Some of them offer free skillbooks and sometimes even ships. 
---
Pandemic Horde
---
Karmafleet
---
EVE University
---
Pandemic Horde is a group which lives in the NE corner of NS, in a region called The Kalevala Expanse. They’re allied with other large nullsec groups in the north. A lot of people roam to them because they can get fights from them, so you’ll get a lot of PvP content if you want. 
---
Karmafleet is a group which is a member of The Imperium. You may also know this group as Goons or Goonswarm. They live in Delve, which is a region in the SW of the map. They are allied with other groups near them, and the space they live in is considered to be the safest space in the game for PvE ISK Making. It’s easy to make money here, but can be hard to PvP outside of bigger fleets. 
---
EVE University is exactly what it sounds like. A group which has different “campuses” and will provide player made classes and tutorials to help you learn EVE. You don’t need to join this to be successful,  I didn’t and personally it’s not my cup of tea.
---
Once you’re on the way to joining a player corporation (if you’re interested, r/evejobs will also have other corps you can look into, your experience may vary though) you should be looking into what kind of skills you should be training. There are 14 skills which are useful no matter what ship you fly, but don’t grant you the ability to fly bigger ships with bigger weapon systems. 
---
My recommendation as an alpha is to train to a specific weapon system and tank type. Once you know what you want to train, train towards that. Each faction uses different tank/weapon types. You can view the factions using the ship tree to make a decision. Early on, you’ll be flying frigates, destroyers and cruisers. Anything bigger costs a lot more SP and to fly it well you’ll need more SP. you can fly Frig/Dessie’s/Cruisers with very little SP and still be effective. 
---
Keep in mind that Energy Weapons/Hybrid Weapons and Projectile Weapons all share Gunnery support skills, Missiles use Missile skills and Drones use Drone skills. 
---
The weapon systems are as follows:
---
Hybrid Weapons: 
---
** Blasters **
---
* Short Range High DPS High tracking (they apply well!). Uses Capacitor. Locked to Kin/Therm Damage Type
---
** Railguns **
---
* Long Range Low DPS Low Tracking. Uses Capacitor. Locked to Kin/Therm Damage Type
---
Projectile Weapons: 
---
** Autocannons ** 
---
* Short Range Moderate DPS High Tracking. No Capacitor Use. Selectable damage types. 
---
** Artillery **
---
* Long Range High Alpha Moderate DPS Low Tracking. No Capacitor Use. Selectable damage types. 
---
Energy Weapons
---
** Pulse Lasers **
---
* Mid tier Range High DPS Good Tracking. Uses Capacitor. Locked to EM/Thermal damage types. 
---
** Beam Lasers **
---
* Long Range High DPS Low Tracking. Locked to EM/Thermal damage types. 
---
Missiles 
---
* Rockets - fit to frigates and destroyers, Low Range moderate DPS launchers with Low application. Only good on a few bonused hulls. 
---
* Light Missiles Probably one of the best early game skills to train for Caldari line ships, used on the caracal and other Rapid Light Missiles Launchers and Light Missile Launchers.
---
* Heavy Missiles - Made for cruisers and up, these are slower missiles which have worse application but do more damage per volley than Light Missiles. They also have long range. They’re not the best right now. These fit Cruisers and Battlecruisers. Rapid Heavy Missile Launchers fit to battleships. 
---
* Heavy Assault Missiles Fit to cruisers and battlecruisers, these missiles have better application and damage then heavy missiles but much less range. 
---
* Torpedoes If you plan on becoming an omega, these are an excellent weapon system for use on bombers (a stealthy frigate which can use these battleship sized launchers). High damage, slow, with medium range. Bad application. 
---
* Cruise Missiles extremely Long Range missiles with high damage and bad application. Battleship Weapons. 
---
Drones
---
** Light ** 
---
* Small and very fast, Low HP. Selectable Damage Types. 5 Mb/s
---
** Medium ** 
---
* Bigger, More damage, but slower than lights. Selectable Damage Types. 10 Mb/s
---
** Heavy ** 
---
* Bigger, more damage but very very slow. Selectable Damage Types. 25Mb/s
---
** Sentry **
---
* Immobile “turrets” that stay in place once dropped and do high damage. Selectable Damage Types.  25 Mb/s
---
Tank Types! 
---
** Armor ** 
---
Armor Tanks use Low slots including energized membranes, steel plates, armor repairers, adaptive nano platings, and armor hardeners to provide tank that is very sturdy. Armor reps do not restore armor HP until the end of the cycle. 
---
** Shield ** 
---
Shield tanks use mid slots including Adaptive Invulnerability Fields, amplifiers, damage specific fields, Shield Boosters, Shield Boost Amplifiers and Shield Extenders. Shield passively repairs itself, but at a very slow pace. Some modules help this to go faster, but it’s a very nice type of tanking. 
---
** Hull ** 
---
Hull tank uses low slots including reinforced bulkheads and damage controls. It’s commonly referred to as manmode tanking because repairing it is rare as the modules for it are very weak. A lot of gallente race ships use this as a “suicide” ship of a sort that deals a lot of damage quickly in hopes that the enemy does not disengage because it thinks it’s winning since Hull is the last health bar you chew through. 
---
Damage Controls fit in the low slot, but are applicable to all 3 tank types. 
---
** Active Tanking **
---
Both armor and shield fits have active tanking, which is done through the use of Armor Repairers and Shield Repairers. These are commonly used in PvE to repair a ships HP as it takes damage. They are also used in certain PvP fits for when fighting solo or in a smaller group to keep yourself alive. They use Capacitor, and/or Nanite Repair Paste/Cap Boosters to repair HP in armor/Shield respectively. 
---
** Buffer Tanking ** 
---
Armor, Shield, and Hull tanking can also utilize buffer tanking. In most fleets, this is how you will be fit, as it gives your friendly healer (Logistics ships, or commonly, Logi) time to heal you. 
---
There is a lot more to the game than this, but this is a decent crash course to the basics. Use the ship tree to find a faction you want to fly out of the basic 4 races (Amarr, Minmatar, Gallente, Caldari) and train towards the applicable skills for that line! You can never go wrong with the basic ewar frigates and tackle frigates early on, so expect to fly them!
---
Goons have the biggest umbrella, I know they're turtling under it... Because I'm in goons. Also, goons have been doing it longer than anyone else.
---
Yea, 10k bot accounts.
---
Boo hooo hooo
---
Just gotta log in to claim?
---
While otherwise it encourages another player type to login or resub. Clearly the 2-4 Account Vet cannot compensate for the sheer Login-Numbers of Bots or PvE-Multiboxers, but taking a look at the classic old roaming routes that died about 3-4 years ago, there is much more life in much more systems now than before. Also PvPers are not salty if krabs do not login, their "magical" warpout denied any content anyway. But now you meet other roamers en masse and can shoot at them.

So I'm quite a new player (about a week old). Went into null sec without knowing what happened to chat. So I did what alphas do and went exploring with my heron. And I was in the middle of the relic site when 5 ships warped in and I was like ohhh fk. U can probably guess what happened.
---
So after refitting I went off to the same place (to get my blown-up ship's stuff as any isk is worth a lot for me). I got my stuff before the same 5 people jumped in. But this time I managed to warp to the nearest station and dock, so I was safe. Decided it was a good idea to say "later kids" in chat cause I'm a genius like that. They kept telling me to come out so I assumed they were camping outside and decided to log off and come back in an hour. 
---
So after an hour I logged back on and chat was empty (because I'm an idiot idk what was blackout lol) so I went undocked. And died. Then in chat some Russian was like "later kid", they chilled around for an hour just to kill me lol XD. 
---
So yea Hey at least I've now learnt with delayed local chat is :D
---
Yay for give-aways \o/
---
we're going in circles now, lets agree to disagree
---
That's just resolution reduction. Not enough jpeg
---
As far as ratting bounties go, you're probably right: right now the payout isn't really worth the risk, be it a vni, a rattle or a carrier. Supers are a bit of a different matter, because you can only really use them under the infamous umbrella, and while you can catch some more now, most of the semi competent non afk guys will be saved anyway.  
---
However, as it was pointed out in at least 1 thread that I read around here, a side effect of the blackout will be an increase in the price of all that is farmed in nullsec due to the increased risk the farmer has to endure: my prediction is that minerals, moongoo, and maybe most notably a lot of deadspace stuff will increase in price substantially, enough in fact to make the underlying activity profitable when counting potential losses. The increased profit from this stuff potentially leads to a situation where just plain ratting isn't anymore your automatic path to getting rich, thus reviving the appeal of a lot of activities now considered niche, like running sites and escalations. The effect is potentially broader: if nullsex ratting isn't optimal anymore, people will remind reading something about c5 ratting (= more people and activity in wormholes) and trying that out, or lvl 5 mission running (= more people in lowsec), or even just plain exploration (more people zipping around with loot in their cargo).

Now, if you ask me, these side effects are good for the overall health of the game, as safe ratting in a perfect intel word is so boring that most successful ratters are in fact bots, while Eve has to offer a refreshing variety of careers and space jobs that under the previous system were suffering in the name of optimization. So anyway, my stance is that an increase in ratting rewards should be pondered carefully: one approach would be to adjust it minimally, in order to factor the increased risk, but at the same time making sure that more specialized and active careers remain all considered more profitable. Another approach would be to overhaul the anomaly system entirely and have pve become not only more engaging for you, but also more prone to interaction with other players, both friends and foes, in order to provide actual content (both pve and pvp) for those involved, be it via nerfing bounties in favour of loot, having ratters need to move around, add specialized and challenging rats, you name it, while at the same time substantially adjusting the bounties.

People are codding the usability of dscan as we speak.
---
Does it even get counted if you don't go past the character selection screen?
---
Thank you for your input mr 6 day old account who only complains about the blackout.
---
From what I understand, it will allow you to go back and claim the Omega reward for all the days you claimed as an Alpha, but it **won't** retroactively unlock days you missed logging in for.
---
So make sure you're at least claiming the Alpha reward daily.
---
Borgs are back in eve !
---
?
---
They’re renaming Slaves to Amulets, am I missing something? What does this have to do with shield slaves lol
---
You ignore the second half of the sentence that has NOTHING to do with turtling up, and I'm the thick fuck?  Sure... and since you're so brain dead that repetition makes your tiny dick hard, I'll repeat:
---
If I'm thick, you're fucking solid granite, bitchtits.  lol
---
Turting up means being 100% defensive, and hiding behind your shell.
---
Scouting outside your shell, sending raiding parties via wormholes to space outside your shell.... not turtling up, you mental midget. lol
---
Nerf gon. Bee man bad.
---
That map is insane.
---
The problem with your logic is that it doesn't follow that people buying plex and not paying with cash would crash the market.
---
This would only happen in a total game collapse where no one is willing to spend money on any part of it. If we've reached that point people trying to plex by ratting is by far the least of our concerns.
---
Ohhhh that makes so much more sense now, I never understood why gankers used catalysts over thrashers
---
Going out on roams isn't new... That's standard activity.
---
The amount of home defense drops was not, it was a whole new level of activity compared to normal.
---
Well said. Quality over quantity.
---
Payment date from BDO coming. Time to boost the metrics.
---
prefer? probably, but if you think tapirium of the galaxy(lets be fair to goons, its not just them) titan main number 432 trained into a titan/super with the prospects of using it in pvp and not just in glorofied bashes or hellfucked tidi maybe once or twice a year, I question their sanity.
---
It already did though
---
Clickbait!
---
Not denying anything... Just merely pointing out that the OP chose to include fairly insubstantial evidence for a region that houses an alliance/coalition that he/she may dislike.
---
Seems like you have a fairly strong opinion as well.. 
---
You do see my point right? or are you just as blind?
---
We aren't talking about what's new or not new, tard-o.  
---
Scouting outside your shell, sending raiding parties via wormholes to space outside your shell.... not turtling up, you mental midget. lol If you leave your blue donut... you are not behind a shell.
---
Great post.
---
Yes we are, because that's the reaction to the change
---
Can I put handcuffs on the ship I tackle and wear a cowboy hat? Then it's not a true marshal police skin.
---
you cracked the code
---
Yeh, that’s one of dumbest jokes I’ve ever heard.
---
You don't have to actually log in. Just make to the character selection screen and ur good to go man!!!
---
Sorry I meant redeemed to character - though looking at it I think its more like 6 months before they are removed from your redeem bar (bottom of login page).
---
Just reading your post it seemed like you were just going to leave them there until you next log in which could have been a while (thats the impression I got).
---
Just did not want you to lose them.
---
why even bother, there is no point in using blops battleships, arguing for the one with the most gimped bonuses is pointless since you wont be using any of them regardless.
---
Honestly, the only real skills I would want to see removed are the ship-fitting skills. Weapon Upgrades, Shield Upgrades, Capacitor Management, etc. 
---
You know, the ones that do nothing more than increase your ships resource pools to what they are actually balanced around. Training them doesn't feel rewarding in the slightest, it just feels like you're *slowly* removing an arbitrary limitation.
---
\*pogchamp\*
---
Wow you discovered the concept of copypasta, are you a private investigator?
---
For a while. The krabs will not be missed, and everyone else will grow accustomed to the blackout and go back to PvE when they run out of ships to blow up.
---
I was told that botting wouldn't be affected because the bots would just be programmed to use D-Scan, and that this would only hurt real players who cannot rely on D-scan because covert-ops cloaks and combat recons exist.
---
I can kinda see that, yea. I don't think it would be so bad if isk wasn't so worthless though. I remember when a bil isk ship was a massive loss, now that's like, the average cost of a front line ship
---
Oh boy, this post is just.... bad.
---
&gt;The fact is it's gone way too far to the other side. CCP have now basically killed mining and ratting and exploration.. That's stupid..
---
Everyone knows wormholers can't rat because no local, right?
---
&gt;There was nothing stopping you PvPing before blackout.
---
PVP was difficult before the blackout because everyone involved had so much intel about the situation, the fight was usually decided (or avoided) before it even started. With the blackout, there are so many more opportunities to throw a wrench into a fight.
---
Also, its tough to pvp anything when everyone within 10 jumps docks up because of shit like near2.
---
&gt;All people are doing is ganking not pvping that's an accidental outcome of you all trying to kill none pvp folk.
---
So you mean they are pvping? That's what PVP is. If you don't like it, too bad. 
---
My favorite part of this whole thing, is that the people screaming "Adapt or die" before, are the ones throwing a fit now. What goes around, comes around.
---
gotta pay that CODE mining permit fam
---
If anyone has serious thoughts/concerns/questions on this that isnt just grr i hate it, or yay its great, happy to listen and relay on to CCP.
---
you're right.

That's even more interesting. It also means POSes are a bit closer to disappearing.
---
Contrary to popular belief, we are not all alts of the same person.
---
Having you in develpment, with these ideas, is exactly what EvE needs.
---
Save us Obi-Wan, you're our only hope.
---
Ami I reading this wrong? I thought drone tracking went from 5% to 10% with this change.
---
Spoiler alert:  The game was ruined long, long ago...
---
Well I’ve played on and off (mainly off, I normally only play a few months at a time) for years, and there’s tons I don’t understand. 
---
One thing you can do is I just pick one thing and learn/get really good at that. 
---
For example, all I do is low sec solo/small gang pvp, and some exploration on an alt. I know pretty much nothing about things like mining or industry, I don’t follow what’s going on with the big null sec alliances etc etc. 
---
Don’t feel overwhelmed by thinking you need to learn every aspect of the game to enjoy it!
---
You can also just go ahead and start the second account and leave it alpha.
---
Jehova!
---
Is Skill farming still worth it?
---
..and how is this, because it seams you have to buy injectors with PLEX (can be real money), so isn't this just in effect buying skill points back which you have already bought through being subbed (Omega) AND the time spent in game (If you put a cost on it eg - no free minerals)?.
---
All the guides seem to be old so was wondering if it had ceased to pay out.
---
I hope quality players pay twice as much for a sub.
---
Is there a good video on how to use D-Scan?  I've read the Eve University bit and looked at some of the resources here, but I either haven't figured it out or it's using what looks like an old UI for the game.
---
There was some fanfest slides about this. Slaves will be shield hp bonus. Iirc.
---
I did my ratting in a ship like that. I stopped. I may switch to like a high sec mission alt or something.
---
Need is enough of a carrot. Roaming gangs and so on will slow down in time, right now everyone is out there enjoying the novelty, but numbers should stabilize soon enough. 
---
By then,the normal dude will be both used to the new environment, and will have developed strategies that allow him to get money without dying too much. 
---
Besides, cutting the hirrible null bouty faucet should help with the nasty inflation, and that'll help everyone.
---
&gt; People in nullsec rat to finance their pvp, it's an additional activity for most of them.
---
**A thousand times this.** If I'm going to run out of money doing PVP because the avenue I trained skills toward for 2 years is no longer viable, I'm simply not going to PVP until there's a replacement, or the situation changes where it becomes viable again. This is coming from someone who barely turns a profit each month, while still paying real-world cash for Omega. **Correction:** *used to* pay real-world cash for Omega.
---
I’ve collected day one already!
---
Slaves will be the Shield implants. Was in one of the fanfest presentations.
---
I'm utterly shocked by the timing of this login to gain free SP event. How unexpected. Haha

Idk why you are being downvoted when you're right...
---
Get out of my head.
---
[Yeah right]((https://zkillboard.com/character/94888963/)
---
Not a bad ratio, considering there only 10 of us who play the game with all of our alts
---
&gt;**but this time** we’re targeting 10,000 players in a single battle 
---
Again, huh?
---
How many chances that crabs buying plex from quality players?
---
Yeah, but you won't know what to put on it until you find a use for it. Plus, dealing with an alpha training queue is really not fun, 24h max queue and all that.
---
So this story, as many of mine go, starts with me doing something silly. I had recently come off the PvP high of Kelon Darklight’s solo competition that he sponsors for those of us in E-Uni and wanted to continue to blow things up.
---
Living at E-Unis WHC gave me the opportunity to find a hole to Delve down the chain (cause let’s be honest, all good stories start by shooting Delve Nullbears). Unfortunately these Nullbears got me on intel fairly quickly.
---
Now one thing you have to know about the Enyo I fly. I nicknamed it the YOLO Enyo because the whole purpose is to throw it at things like a Redshirt and see if it suffers their same fate, or ends up victorious (which since I tackle things like combat BCs is hit or miss).
---
At this point a mild gatecamp had formed. It was an Eris, a Condor, and a Brutix. That I knew I could handle. Bubblers die fast, the Condor would be coming in close, and the Brutix can’t track me orbiting at 500. So I said ‘Why not’ and warped to the gate.
---
My plan was working well. Obviously the bubble went up, and the Condor came in for the ram. I switched to Null and burned him down quickly while the Brutix and Eris headed my way. Next up was the Eris. He was smart and started burning back to the gate so I grabbed him with a scram web, and used Null to take him down too. Last up, the Brutix. Changed to Void and started orbiting. It was going quite well. Obviously he was hull tanked. At about 2/3 hull an Onyx landed on grid and I knew I was screwed. I popped my ADC and OH’d the guns hoping to burn the Brutix in time. Unfortunately I only got him to 25% before the Onyx made me go *splat*.
---
Overall I was pretty happy with this one. Ended up isk positive and would have killed the BC if he didn’t bring in a friend. One thing my time at the Uni has taught me is that if you don’t try, you can’t kill it, and if you do it will make a good story. That and WHs are by far the best place to live. 
---
Well that’s one of my blackout stories there are, and will be more as I continue my silly shenanigans 
---
I just tried on an alt, and it didn't work, but that might just be a big.  I will add a support ticket I guess...
---
Guess it's Ishtar time
---
yeah i don't think anyone gets into a supercap with the intention of using it often, and i don't think anyone is under the illusion that they would. However you comment: 
---
&gt;&gt;Its worse than that - who would want to fly a glorified battering ram that is only useful for attacking walls? That's boring.
---
&gt;goons?
---
which implies that goons actively wanted to fly their titans and supers just to knock down undefended structures, which is not the case. 
---
glorified bashes are pretty much all we get nowadays, because instead of playing the game panfam et al just wanted to dick on small alliances for years instead of improving themselves and amassing an armada. now they can't contend so instead just get super salty on reddit. Its great, we win in game and out.

Unfortunately the numbers actually dropped by 3000-4000 accounts during last weekend

Jesus man... bitterness has really deteriorated your posting quality, it's like you don't get it anymore, what happened?
---
**Let me elaborate:**
---
I shit post. It's what I do when I'm on the toilet or killing time, it's very entertaining. The self-belief that I'm contributing in some greater way to the meaning of life or that the feces I sling against the wall in this subreddit are revolutionary works of cultural importance is absolutely, ***I can assure you***, non-existent. A lot of the idiots on this sub reddit eat these posts (*not referencing just mine, all posts in general*) up like new gospel delivered over guitar rifts by some late-20s t-shirt wearing evangelical hipster and they are legal-drinking aged virgins who realized celibacy is terrible and now seek justification to violate the Good Book and unlock that chastity belt - or vice versa. The overall r/eve public trend, *in which I mean the average window licker's emotional state and general sentiment*, changes every 8 to 9 months, around the same time a horribly thought-out community idea hits peak third-trimester and a new crowd-sourced abomination comes into being. Naturally, resident king turd shitposters of r/eve play slightly-to-extreme outlier positions from the public opinion mean (*w/ exception to Olmeca - he's just that retarded* *^(in b4 he SJW references this)*) and thrive in the unintelligible polarizing environment created. With that said, king turd posters usually exhibit a natural immunity to one another, occasionally cross-posting other king turds to provide amusing contrasting views and stir up the sperg, but resisting temptation of sustaining an engaged debate (***see:*** ***don't touch the poo***). We sometimes easy-mode the current and other times we swim upstream, but I can guarantee no one actually thinks about their post after that 'submit' button is pressed.
---
Here are examples of king turd shitposters (*imho*) for educational reference:

The "*out of touch*" is a beautiful cherry topping of irony seeing that you use to be fairly established in the king turd shitposters guild. However, lately it has become apparent that time was not good to you in this subreddit, your recognition and relevancy has rapidly faded. Your posts have degraded into perpetual attacks of other posters with the same one liner, *in some form or another*, as your your desperation for the dank upvote grows tireless. Depressing times it is, I shall have a drink for you good sir.
---
You're still an online account, so yes
---
Think about your statement.
---
Bots rely on local for intel (and it is 100% accurate to determine a friendly or a neutral/hostile).  If Bots switch to DSCAN it will only be 100% accurate when DSCAN picks up an object (whether ship or deploy-able).  It doesn't know if its friendly, neutral, or hostile.  Even if they dock up, you can stay cloaked in system and hunt.  They will eventually undock/log back in.  You're still in system, and they don't know.  Bye bye bot ship.
---
And so, it begins!
---
All I'm missing now is the navy seals one and I'll have a full house.
---
EVE 2019 lmao how far it has fallen
---
literally all the sub cap ratting / miners have gone to ground.  Umbrella or not, your options are now just to use a super or gtfo.
---
are you allowed to fly a dread? thats not a heron
---
Same place as villy
---
Everyone that used to rat but has now stopped due to the blackout, is a bot. 
---
You heard it first here bois!
---
ive tagged along to your remind me, see you in a year idiot
---
He's baiting them. He uses a corvette to shoot the MTU, which causes him to go suspect. The Marauder pilot thinks "Oh a free kill, KB green" and pops him. Now he has a limited engagement timer. If he can get back to station/citadel, reship, and get back on grid before the timer expires, he's free to engage with the Leshak now and the Marauder is fucked. 
---
Lesson here is: Don't get Baited
---
On a side note, Marauders fucking suck now. The immobility of Bastion is lame. You can't refit with a weapons timer now because CCP thought combat refitting was OP with triage carriers and changed that a while back. The weapons timer was added to Bastion mode because of people playing station games with Marauders years ago. It's just been a perfect storm of shit that has been changed to make Marauders suck ass that weren't directly intended to nerf Marauders.

---
Just nerf supers/caps make anom depletion a thing and unforgiving then change how anoms work while maybe increasing the isk from it
---
nobody uses an umbrella for VNIs or miners.  Also nobody uses an umbrella for bots.
---
Oh i dont know, Maby the one where DRF and WinterCo had a NIP with DRF While DRF was fighting TRI+Friends.  
---
FRT. then decided to move into Insmother anyway and attack DRF Even though they made a Nip like a month earlier basically giving the final preassure that made DRF Coallapse. (would likely have happened anyway but it happened a lot faster because of it) the point being, dont trust Noraus.
---
In this case. What was it 150 mio?
---
Not everyone is going to do that though.
---
It looks like CCP collected some metrics on Blackout....
---
Where does Gigx saying "He boomed me" come from? I forgot.
---
Exactly.  Of course, if players had enough patience to wait the [5 or 10 minutes needed](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+catch+bots+in+eve+online&amp;s=&amp;t=v) for the bot to go back out, they wouldn't have needed to beg CCP for a local nerf so that they could actually play in nullsec on easy mode.
---
Given the public improvements to stat tracking that CCP have been doing I’m sure that they are able and interested in differentiating between people playing and people just collecting the reward. That would be useful feedback on blackout changes. It shows that there is a section of the community active enough to care about a relatively small amount of SP but who actively makes the decision not to progress through to the game when on the character selection screen. 
---
If I had just made a major change I would be interested in the change in the number vs the last login event that add far greater rewards.

Thanks for following this up.  I was beginning to worry :3
---
I seem to remember that there was some target that CCP had to manage in a certain timeline.
---
Well we know they log the amount of time you're logged in. That would be the easiest place to start.
---
Select * from loginactivity where active hours &gt; 140 and session start between '2019-07-17' AND '2019-07-10'
---
There's everyone who spent more than 20 hours a day logged in over the last week. Adjust as necessary.
---
If someone wants money from you, you are about to get scammed.
---
Schrodinger's bots.  They are in a superstate of being both logged off and ratting until you warp into a site and collapse the wave function.
---
Ya but if those people magically warping weren't their targets in the first place why didn't this happen before? If these pvpers actually wanted to fight they were always able to but didn't. Why was that?
---
Having met Elo and knowing how awkward he is when he isn’t expecting to meet people, this is 100% made up.
---
Wh Mining + 2 accounts on Project Discovery (and maybe one Albion Online account farming)
---
So then you could cap collateral insurance through some mechanism that estimates the market value of the items.
---
If thats too hard then risk needs to be mitigated another way. Bc as it stands hauling in sec space is stupid as an isk earning activity. Its higher risk and lower reward than nearly every other way people make isk.
---
I might be wrong but getting to character selection screen is already logging in.
---
Buying plex nets ccp more money.
---
Lol I thought this too “oh they can just search up a random bot player ez pz with sql search” 
---
IF that’s even how they do it there’d probably be a bunch of parameters in the WHERE such as 
---
WHERE ActiveTime &gt; 10m 
---
AND
---
fuck I don’t even know but I’m personally curious now brb going to phpmyadmin
---
You are the most ducking stupid dumb person  ever.  WH are not j  the SLIGHTEST the same as nullsec. Fuck off out of this topic and come back when you have a clue what you are evening talking about.. go..just go
---
Because those that unsub are missing out on hundreds of thousands of SP
---
It really depends on the definition of people
---
I can hear that photo in my head.
---
you know, my mind is automatically filling in the 'shit' before 'posting'.  Shytlexia???
---
The hunters will never admit this.
---
Do you have a source for that? I can’t find anything about that on google. I would expect there are some terms or performance linked benefits but exactly what they are would be speculative on my part.
---
I think what he meant is that “cerebears” want to decrease log in numbers and this “gift” works against that. So overall Blackout will look better in statistics.
---
&gt;Think about your statement.
---
Okay, I've thought about it.
---
Now, *you* think about my statement, and *then* think about how you missed the blatantly obvious sarcasm.
---
Did you know a vni makes 9-10 times less isk than what one single human can make ratting in one super carrier in the same amount of time?
---
Indy Alt, PI, and the price of a pint on PLEX occasionally.
---
Speaking for myself here. I pay for more than a month at a time. All of my subs run for long enough to pick this up on all accounts. 
---
I have already cancelled the subs. 
---
I suspect that if someone were going to quit they would have done so by now and if the blackout is a big enough deal for them to unsubscribe then 200k SP is probably not going to entice another month of fees and if it is that is all it will do.
---
But that money still did NOT come from guys plexxing, it came from guys selling PLEX ingame. I can only speak for myself here, but i invested the same amount of cash into PLEX when the 30d PLEX was around 500 Mil.
---
I kinda hope they make it a fully functioning citadel. They don't need to give anyone docking access to it, but with the benefit of deliver to citadel functionality, people could still leave their tributes there by sending them to a CCP owned character (or maybe even the character that has passed).
---
It's not beyond the skill of man for someone in CCP to write a script to parse these deliveries and copy the messages somewhere.
---
who asked you fag
---
I mean, you've NEVER had to play for SP. Just put shit in your queue and have a pilot's license.
---
The only problem with that though. is that anything a human can do, and bot can do.
---
There is generally not one thing that bots do that just screams: "I'm a bot" That you can reference in a where clause.
---
Why would you risk ratting in null at all now, when it's easier to buy/sell on the market and you don't even have to risk any isk printer by undocking at all
---
Except everything is said starts on a false assumption that pvpers wanted to pvp. If the bots warping off never affected them in the first place why did this change need to happen to cause them to fight, why weren't they out hunting for each other in the first place?
---
Hi, i have played eve for a while now (just doin my agent missions and fighting a bit, but nothing too big) and thought it would be cool to join an Alliance to do , like, more interesting stuff like fighting or exploring and such. ive heard about the big wars and stuff and know a few alliances (like Goonswarm or test) but still dont know which one to join. I cant play long (like 1 1/2 hours a day (16, still regulated wifi &gt;-&lt;)) so i dont know if its important to play a lot when u r in an alliance. Any recommendations?
---
You repeating, over and over, your predicted financial impact as a result of the change does not make your predictions more valid.  Why do you struggle so hard with this concept?  
---
###Your opinion and personal experiences are not an apt substitute for data.
---
The "Cemetery" pos is long go.
---
cause there was nobody, as NEAR2 Intel bot pinged when I was 5 jumps out and everything either docked or dusted of the gate Bosons for their next single T1 Cruiser Killmark where the Boson fuel cost more than the ship bosoned ... ^^
---
I cannot even fly one :D i didn't think anyone would read or answer on it :P
---
Ah yes the favorite arguement to kill local, saying only bots want local and anyone who doesn't like this change is botting.
---
Now imagine yourself the armor implant prices.      
---
Only in delve, only ... like 4 agents in NPC delve.        
---
Armor implant set will cost as much as nyx when old supply will be gone.
---
a copypasta that made vily actually melt down
---
Bandwidth too I believe, so it will be down to medium drones instead of heavies which is the major part of this nerf.
---
*clapping*
---
Hmm you may be correct
---
But that was because you were hunting ratters and not other pvpers. What do you expect to find in delve or any other area covered by a super umbrella?
---
Thats nothing i expected at least 40% drop.       
---
Online keeps up nicely without the local (don't know about subs level, but this is CCP only data).
---
No honor among thieves aye
---
Speak for yourself main.
---
We're all just really into edging and never commit to finish.
---
Noted
---
Wtf ranger regiment/darkness have an umbrella dont know what you smoking
---
and Community fits finally coming
---
You’re almost right. I remember reading about writing some python scripts to automate mining in OSRS and learned that their bot detection systems pretty good.

The difference that screams “I’m a bot” is usually mouse travels and click speed. If EVE devs can track the cursor on someone’s client, and their clicks, they can see if the account is doing these actions at bot speeds, because it’s just a script running commands, or a human who takes more time and reconsideration in mouse movements and clicks. 
---
That would be one solid example that programs use to detect bots. I personally don’t know the bot programs for EVE so I’m speculating. 
---
Again, speculating that they’d use SQL for that data, the WHERE variables could be something like;
---
  WHERE mousetravelspeed &gt;= 10ms
---
  AND inputRelay &lt;= 10ms
---
Again, pure speculation but I’m bored at work so I like talking about this lol. Doing some research into it now
---
Yes but the common implication is that the pve players only paid via plex and this is bad for ccp. The more people paying their sub via plex is good for ccp.
---
I'm not really sure I understand your point; at least from my perspective, I've never seen the issue as one Nidhoggur being impossible to engage -- the issue was and still is the ease with which nearly infinite caps and supercaps can rat and mine nearly infinite ISK and minerals without ever putting themselves at risk. This hasn't significantly changed with any of the nerfs because there's been no change to mineral availability and no change to capital projection.
---
The krabs have a massive double standard to CCP changes:
---
When CCP hit PvPers with the nerfbat, we're expected to change how we play the game radically. Deleting passive moon mining basically killed the idea of a supercap capable alliance without sov krabbing, encouraging more people to krab in caps and supers killed nano roaming and small gang hunting, perch citadels and ansiblex gates killed gate camping and disruption of movement...
---
Yet, when CCP hit the krabs with the nerfbat, they don't want to adapt at all. They come on r/eve, cry like babies, threaten to unsubscribe, all the while chanting the mantra that they agree that null is stale and needs changing. If not the local blackout; what changes *would* they support to bring back small-gang nano roams, nomadic deployments, subcapital fights in general, and a sense of danger to 'null security' space?
---
But Elo is a toxic frustrated kid no wonder he posts crap and the state of Eve where this is acceptable even as a joke.
---
If you do not want to be harrassed during ratting, there was a solution in this game from the start, it was called Hisec.
---
The fact that a dual rep neuting VNI can get better ratting ticks than most dedicated ratting ships and win a scram range 1v1 against almost every cruiser and down in the game is absurd.
---
I think it was about additional payments if certain targets are met. Didnt have anything to do with the 425m I'm fairly certain.
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
---
Still ratting. But i always fitted a scram to my VNI. The Istar is a flat upgrade.
---
Run, save yourself while you can!   
---
Everything is buyable  with in game money (ISK) but it's not necessarily P2W. How you make it, is up to you.   
---
Here's a brief overview.  [https://eve-guides.fr/images/wtd.jpg](https://eve-guides.fr/images/wtd.jpg)   
---
Eve is a sandbox. You can play for free as an Alpha clone, which although limited, should give you a taste of what it's like.
---
People keep referencing this line that empire space is more dangerous than null, but it's a line of bullshit. Pls stop. It's not.
---
So when does the rest of eve tell the mittens to eat their ass and drop in to glass deleve
---
Not sure, lots of Reddit bots and Eve bots, I have no idea what the like 3k actual goons are doing
---
Reffitting with slowcats and super / Titan was op, ccp never blamed triage
---
It's pretty obvious you're out of the loop because I couldn't even begin to list all the stuff that has changed in the last 8 years. To think you could glean that from a lousy lvl 3 high sec mission is pretty silly tbqh.
---
My point is not meant as a direct snipe at you. It's at the statement that many people have been saying that it's been years of nerfs only to one play style (solo/small gang) and that life has been so hard for them and that all changes and nerfs specifically target them and that no one else at all has had their play styles changes repeatedly. The level of rhetoric and reeee on all sides is getting obscene, like.. one group or another are super human for surviving changes over the years and should be exalted as such.
---
buy high sell low
---
If you're single boxing and playing solo, I think you'd probably want to go with abyssals or burner missions.
---
cool story bro.
---
Tell us, when there is nothing left to target except for other 'elites' like you, and you both avoid each other because, armed... then what.
---
Actually yeah point, I do know what a decent # of goons are doing, they're in Esoteria derping around getting smartbombed
---
Sounds like you need to frag your leadership
---
You said that as if it was the only argument for no local. It’s not, just one of the many good ones.
---
That doesn't mean it can't be made better.
---
I’ll have to say that I don’t know. I can only find the press release which contains none of that information. You could be right, or not, I don’t know my friend :).
---
I still couldn't bring myself to do it just yet but i have the feeling i should really consider selling off my accounts and make bank while i still can.
---
Not what I said, I am saying if you as a pvper didn't want to get bosoned, stop going places where they boson everyone who comes into their space. Going into delve and expecting a pvp fight now or before is stupid. Everyone claims they are looking for fights but we all know what you are going to get roaming into umbrella space.
---
so they're also going to ban every cloaky camper and safe cyno alt?
---
time logged in per day isn't foolproof
---
So is alpha clone basically the shit version and you eventually have to subscribe to become omega and have an actual chance at the game
---
yes assuming you dont die to all the new shit
---
That's a pretty decent hit to a game that has 20-30k online average. 
---
Keep in mind it's a novelty at the moment and people who came back just for the blackout offset that figure by whatever amount it may be. For humans, a novelty wears out after a short period of time.
---
Woah get the fuck outta here with this common sense
---
Join a corp that caters to new players.  EVE is a social game.  If you play alone you'll miss most of the fun.
---
I don't know you, nor do I know how to recognize your version of sarcasm in text.  If it was sarcasm, then I apologize I couldn't tell.
---
And those are the only two options, amirite? 
---
Holy shit, I always thought the term "nullbear" was too much, but this shit is slowly convincing me otherwise.
---
I have 200m in the bank. I only go outside when there is an alliance fleet with reimburstment. What I'm doing right now it I sent all my money to an alter in highsec which i'm finishing training to do abyssal sites. I'm moving my income to low and highsec in order to have isk. It will be a while until I can go back to lose ships in nullsec.
---
The overview seems to work fine. Doesn't it do exactly this?
---
I mean I don’t think you’re wrong it’s just more them rewarding loyal players who are willing to stick around. The game will keep moving with or without them, I figure.
---
&lt;SIGH&gt; Sorry, I'm like 3 pots of coffee in and I overreact a wee :D
---
How do you exactly do that
---
Reactions
---
Holy shot that's a blingy motherducker
---
Market bro. 
---
Make your isk work for you with zero risk of someone blowing it up in space
---
:). You are also correct that some people will be missing out on SP to make a point. 
---
Everyone has to make that judgement for themselves. 
---
EVE will soldier on as it always has with, or without me. The fact that I don’t want to play it doesn’t mean you (or anyone else) shouldn’t. You do you and I’ll do me.
---
Tell me wise oracle what the skill train time into a fit super is?
---
And pray tell what am I to do in the mean time?
---
And how to get the isk to pay for the skillbooks... and said super and fittings??
---
PvP?  Because you make so much isk doing that?
---
When it doesn't become such a suicide-inducing task to bash 50 keepstars.
---
My advice is to find people to Trust!
---
Who said it's the only two options? Are you an angry autist? Sure sounds like it.
---
PLEX on credit card.
---
You sure that wasn't a panda?
---
"Oh look, a piece of candy!"
---
Unless CCP has released information on this, how could you possibly know? Pls give a source if you have one. Otherwise please don't make some claim like you know what you are talking about.
---
Bless you.
---
Second response as to what changes would be supported? Can't speak for them. I hung up my claws for the most part 18 months ago. So speaking on both sides? I would love to see a permanent 1 minute delay of me showing up in local even with the best of observatories put in place. I or a small group could definitely catch people in that time. If system or citadel isn't running or whatever, up to 10 minutes? Meaning in and out of system fast enough no one anywhere sees me. I'd be for that 1000 %. But in a universe with cynos, I'm against the idea of a permanent black out combined with cloaked ships. It's too powerful. That means I could place a cloaky after downtime and then any time after that ever, cyno in a blops or bomber group off grid and unless someone hit the dscan during that 30 seconds at a random time all day- you will never know what's coming. Meaning you are asking the defender/prey to be on tenterhooks 24/7 when they play and that will not engender more people to be out and be bait. I want more people out to kill. Moreover, I want more big fish to me out there and things that can escalate. The mindset that we need to aim for small and solo gang being the supreme content and phase out opportunities for large scale fights to form from catching prey isn't for me. I like it all and saying goodbye to big fights other than reactions to structure bashes wouldn't suit me.
---
What a farce.
---
Because PVP in eve is similar in a way to a food chain. You have the krabs, the pvpers who hunt the krabs, and the pvpers who hunt the pvpers. If the krabs can't be hunted because they are either botters or using Near2 etc, it makes much less content for both sets of pvpers.
---
See last line of edit. There are any number of metrics they can use to measure '	activity', ratting ticks, mission completions etc. Doesn't have to be logged in time.
---
&gt; what the hell are those fat containers for Omega's Day 1 reward?
---
they're presumably 100k SP cans (the actual reward is a 250k sp account-locked redeemable though)
---
Are you serious?
---
Coding?
---
good job catching onto the joke, idiot.
---
Ever heard of satire? Also man someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed today, chill out.
---
Look it up. It's been discussed several times already. It's been a while, but one of the older CSM members even posted on here a while back stating what CCP said about it. 
---
So please don't come on here refuting something like you know what you're talking about.
---
Extremely unpopular in our sector, people plainly stopped logging in, almost zero meaningful activity. 
---
Not that there is any surprise. Null sec is all about ratting and mining. Even for PVPers grinding is necessary for affording new ships. Turning off local kills both PVE and PVP. The only difference is that PVE dies first. 
---
However the real popularity of this blunder of a decision will show in a couple of months when people subscriptions run out because currently there is still reason to log in for PI and other non space related activities which are still far more profitable than high sec.
---
When those omega subs run out, people will drop to alpha and either head back to high sec or completely abandon the game. First people with small pockets and gradually it will work its way up to people with deeper pockets. 
---
CCP is on a self destructive roll for the past 1 year, started with the still broken local chat, the clumsy ban and now with the short sighted local chat turn off. 
---
It's still very early draw conclusions as I said, because omega subs have still to run out, mine yearly sub expires in 2 month, but even now the early numbers from zkillboard and dotlan.maps are disastrous to say the least and of course it ain't going to get better.
---
I can see a new meme coming in the future:
---
Someone buys a slave set after the patch, plugs them in but forgot that they are no longer for armor.
---
you realise that this is the mentality of every bloc right?
---
so frag everyone?
---
Look man i think these log in rewards are good especially with such a grest event going on right now like the black out
---

---
The fact they listen to Wallymarts and can even undock blows my mind. Truely a group of immature idiots.
---
Advanced weapon upgrades 5.  It opens so many doors for tight fittings that min max a ships capabilities. Basically all the fitting skills should be 5, rigging to 3-4, support skills for gunnery and middle to 4 at min if you want to use which ever.
---
AFK VNI ratting... oh wait...
---
just play with one, later on if you want more they scale well in terms of being useful and profitable ( not so profitable anymore with the blackout lol ). Imagine having whole raid team in wow but without much more work than 1 account

I made most of my isk from passive moon mining before it was changed to this garbage active mining meta where you actually have to share moon goo with others and park this God awful ship known as a rorqual on your goo field while using these silly overpriced drones that generate free killboard stats from the idiots who lose them / and also get them stolen on a regular basis.
---
To answer your question I would say a brand new character into a well fit super, 3 years or 60-100 bil in injectors and fit.
---
I used (past tense) supers to get security status back into the positive and also generates a healthy sum at the same time and getting adms up quickly.  If I do something it's gonna be efficiently and benefit me

I saw this post and thought it was a joke. And then I logged in. OK.

"Chance" is subjective. You can accomplish great things in a T1 frigate with the right group of friends but it all depends on what you're looking for.
---

Is there such a thing as an expensive crack pipe?
---
It would have the same destiny that the vehement
---
Because every time CCP tries to fix something, they just end up reinforcing the blue doughnut. Which is good for the blue doughnut. Which is why they want CCP to keep fixing things.
---
I did. Guess what I found. Nothing. Because it doesn't exist.
---
I would avoid trying to take ship hulls and drone sizes to V before working on a lot of other things. You can do a lot of good with a hull to IV and med/heavy drones to IV (with faction drones) while focusing on the actual gun/missile skills that will blanket affect all of your ship selections. Maybe Light drones to V, that's not a long item. Targeting skills are a big one, for lock speed and range. Again, going to IV is a good start. Shield and armor resist skills to IV.
---
You are not wrong. 
---
We are already well after the time that SPs really matter.  
---
With injectors and bonuses like this they have been devalued to the point of being only a minor inconveniences.

I have 5 accounts with over a million banked SP just waiting to find a use for.

Whenever you stand up to lead them, naturally. Be the change you wish to see.

I could see Pally working as a smallgang DPS platform with scorch and the bonused MJD but it'd need one helluva screen.

VTSAX -&gt; Credit Card -&gt; PLEX
---
&gt; I don't know if the ramjag has any resist mods, but I know my orthrus fit is t2/meta, most of my skills are lvl 5 and I always heat everything in situations like this
---
most reasonable ramjags have a kinetic rig, some switching to a poly in its place.
---
&gt; And I didn't alpha him, he was boosting, still got him down with several volleys. 
---
alpha doesn't mean kill, it means the damage applied at a single point. That's why he was bleeding armor/structure, he can tank your dps but your alpha can chip away at his other tanks.
---
&gt;Correct me if I'm wrong, but ramjag damage mitigation relies solely on speed and shield boost, not resists, so a ceptor with scram and web basically neuters it completely as long as it's tackled close to DPS ship range.
---
the jag has some pretty crazy base resists across the board, not just in his shield mind you but in all buffers, especially the EM on the armor and 60% resists across the board on structure(and this is why they have so much leeway to bleed into them). 
---
His speed is able to mitigate a shit ton of dps, yes, but that's because its an assault frig so it gets 50% less sig radius increase from mwd(who thought this was a good idea lmao), however that will stop being the case once he reaches the target, which won't take long at top ~4.2k cold and ~6k hot before drugs/links/implants.
---
Now the real thing shield boosts, a dual masb jag will get 243 ehp/s *per oh booster* on their omni resists, you're getting frontloaded reps of 25% of your shield back every activation of the masb, and with no heat(just to make rounding easier) you can do that every 3 seconds, on each masb. And that's all before the adc.
---
At the end of the day he doesn't need to outtank more than his ancils+adc can last, if he scrams you the blob just warps to him and that's it, or if they can project they'll hit you and thats it too, and once he's on you at zero you can't really neut his scram off cause nos. The saving grace is that ramjag pilots tend to be completely garbage, but that doesnt take away from the ship. Legit dude just put a ramjag in pyfa and check the stats, dual masb, adc, nano, overdrive, nos, scram and the rest depends, but thats the base.
---
And one last thing, the point OP and pretty much everyone doing small gang is trying to get at is not how to *survive* ramjags, its not hard to disengage, if you see a jag just warp out no biggie, its about how to not give up the grid and the fight once such ship comes in. Losing ships in a fight isn't really a big issue if there is something interesting to be done there, hell every group of those are littered with losses, it's about being able to not be forced off the grid.

So that's it, its all about contacts, I'll do some research and look into what other users have posted in reply, thanks dude
---
No but implying only bots don't like it is disingenuous.
---
&gt; these systems were packed with VNI’s all being run by REAL PEOPLE 
---
But what is your problem, real people ratting or bots ratting?
---
Because this game is more than just a market sim. People play for the spaceships.
---
Ratting in null is great. I used to enjoy people coming in for fights. I expect it will happen more often if this continues
---
Lmao you think the rest of eve can fight us
---
This might be a stretch but logically wouldn't there be corps that scam new players into joining them
---
The same as implying that everyone who rats while sitting at their desk is a bot.

Ok, I understand that point, but I don’t think any one has implied that only bots don’t like this.

To be honest it’s probably not the best answer to bots, but I personally believe it’s the best one we have seen so far. 
---
I’d expect those bots to be re-designed and appear again after a while anyways. 
---
I like the change but that’s my opinion.
---
Might be hard to find content depending on where you are, but it could be cool.
---
These are all the reasons I unsubbed my 4 accounts too.  Removal of local is the laziest change they could have possibly made and shows how ignorant they are to the problems and how desperate they are to try literally everything besides a well thought thru solutions to the myriad of problems.
---
&gt; You can accomplish great things in a T1 frigate
---
This. I'm an Alpha clone and I normally fly T1 frigate tackle and I love it.
---
Must be Lumio
---
is it in a timezone Americans can interact with yet
---
When will local be back?
---
The flaw in that logic is that the only krabbers out there krabbing are under super umbrellas and basically untouchable by standard PVPers, so the only PVP happening is PVP between PVP players. Which they could have been doing all along, local or not.
---
 (Exception for krab bots/idiots that didn't get the memo and get killed once as a result.)
---
That's true. My mistake.
---
Dont bio. I could take it off your hands!
---
Before MJDessies you could do some cool mjd kiting with that setup but now that every ship can follow suit it's lost a lot of the power on that front. It's just so expensive with a small gang, they tend to just get cynoed on every time sadly.
---
When CCP decides to release a dedicated structure both sides of this debate will complain about... so soon™.
---
You are about 4 years too late
---
&gt;(Exception for krab bots/idiots that didn't get the memo and get killed once as a result.)
---
This is quite a big exception, there's plenty out there to hunt at the moment. Nullsec is popping off compared to before blackout.
---
Yeah, I do hope they fix it some time. But generally traveling light is a good idea regardless.
---
Is this political? I thought test were no longer allowed to discuss politics. How many more lies can tapi tell there line members?
---
Yup and frankly all of what those dudes are looking for still exist somewhere in game they just feel entitled to have it in 1DQ because grr goons.  
---
Low sec exists for precisely the kinds of content they want.
---
"performance based incentives" was the word the press release used
---
Im so excited for this, gonna be like a poor mans deimos
---
No newbie corp will require you to pay money, "hold your assets," etc.    If a corp recruiter asks this type of stuff from you, it's a scam.
---
Hopefully never

PI mainly.  
---
Sometime buy back some gas frome my corpmates and do reactions  
---
WH BTW
---
all our old seasonal events had us actually playing the game for skins and attribute boosts, now we just hit the log in button once for free shit.
---
Except those pvpers who hunted each other didn't before this change because they were just as risk adverse as krabs. They just are unwilling to admit they only wanted to free wins.
---
Gottem.

As mentioned earlier, whenever CCP decides to release an observatory structure. IMO this will probably be at Eve Vegas so at least a few months.

What are you talking about? The ISK being used to buy PLEX **literally** only comes from three places. Buying PLEX in game and selling it doesn't just **create** ISK out of nowhere.

I'm honored that I feature so prominently in your fantasies. Truly, such a rich tapestry from a fertile mind. This is something approximate to art.
---
That was a point that needed to be made.   Miners adapted to Rorquals.  Empires adapted to Citadels. Wormholers adpated to the burning of Rage.  Goons adapated to Delve. PanFam adapted to jump fatigue (poorly)
---
I worry the multi-boxing Rorq fleets are gonna unsub and a whole lot of content goes with it.
---
If I wasn't keeping it for myself and wasn't going to bio I'd figure out how to EMT it.
---
I don't see how any of CCP nerf that target goons did actually hurt goons.. 
---
So far they are still the top 1 (supers/titan fleets, MER, number of player). Meanwhile we saw over the last years many alliance slowly dying like GOTG and Panfam. 
---
The only big fish getting their shit fix are FRT and Legacy
---
Yeah, but what you're forgetting is that VNI ratting is alpha viable and largely AFK, which makes it easy to multibox.
---
ok then i can unsub
---
Ganktard really doesn't work for this
---
From deflation the value of the isk will increase. Since there will be less isk pumped into the economy.
---
So then about your prediction?
---
The week they black out null... and surprise surprise free SP to motivate people to login to claim to keep their logins up... Or I'm just pessimistic.  Now we know CCP is padding their data, aka; zero interest of listening to player input through protest.

I'm still logging in because EVE is interesting atm...I like the changes, but they need fine tuning...but I'm just tooting the horn.
---
Hopefully not, but yeah, I would give it a few months at least before you see anything about it, if at all

When alphas had their skillset expanded, i was quite concerned about giving them t2 weaponry in general..i did not care much for t2 small ships...but t2 guns/missiles/drones?....that didn't quite fit.
---
Good to see some changes in that area.
---
Whats the matter with you? Don't know how to click a link?
---
I hadn’t had my coffee yet. So sue me.
---
Good on them with this event and the handling of the entire blackout.  Well done with the carrot and stick CCP.
---
We are moving further the further away from new players being so skill limited and this is a really good thing for the long term survival of eve.  New players need to come in and stay and if getting them some quick SP does that then all the better i say.
---
These salty goon fucks are actually going through my post history downvoting! Atrocious!
---
Yes, please. Get outta here. One less baby with hopefully a dozen Rorquals accounts you want to pretend you pay money for.

Is this supposed to be saying no one stopped ratting during the blackout? Or that if you stopped ratting you were wrong?
---
no, you're right, he is being held against his will to protect the thing he was campaigning to stop: "botting".
---
Naraus must have his family held captive to ensure he would comply.

This one is even better !

This but even bigger.it is more efficient to bring a few things up to IV than to bring one up to V. Do this whenever possible.

---
When will local be black?
---
- use a referal code if you create a new account.  
---
- find a nice corp. leave it if it wasn't that nice after all  
---
- try lots of game plays, and chose what is fun to you  
---
- you can try it for free as long as you want. you will need to sub to realy dive in it but you have at least 6 month of free content without being blocked  
---
- don't try to sub with plex, not yet
---
I mean...  It really is accurate. If you  ask me why do I play eve, I can not answer. I just do...
---
bot got updated 2 days ago.
---
Could be worse with AZERTY or QWERTZ
---
There was also this thread that directly contradicts what you are saying. I'm not going to bother linking it to prove it exists, but it does, just trust me. 
---
If you don't believe me, just look it up. If you can't find it, you're just not looking hard enough. 
---
Also it was mentioned at some point during the games history. Hope that helps.
---
can i have your stuff?
---
&gt;Bandwidth too I believe, so it will be down to medium drones instead of heavies which is the major part of this nerf.
---
But they'll just use mediums... Less isk/hr but still automated
---
Empty local feels lonely tbh...
---
There are definitely more baddies around which is nice tho. I just can see them and they wont respond to local chirping anymore
---
See you later buddy. Go win eve while the rest of us are adapting.

Can't wait for the next season.

We got the SOE face implants and the SARO battle suit. You can also get some pretty grim skin coloring in the Creator.
---
A change that should have happened a long time ago and should stay.  CCP knew that the blackout would hit the player counts and despite that they went ahead with it anyway because its the right move for eve as a whole.
---
Another one! get rid of all the retards!
---
Villy leaves the toilet seat down when he pees and doesnt clean up after.

&gt; If you do not want to be harrassed during ratting, there was a solution in this game from the start, it was called Hisec

**CCP Report to Korea**: We have seen only a slight dip of total logins in protest of no-local event.

Actually on a Sunday at a time people can attend. Sweet.

Bud I pay annually. Whether or not I can be bothered to log in there was no way I could have managed to unsubscribe fast enough following the announcement of blackout in order to not qualify for it.

Free SP is free SP. Why wouldn’t I log in for it if I want it?
---
Not entirely sure what your point is.
---
maybe dont sit drooling at reddit 24/7 you virgin?
---
well only 1 rorqual account so far. One is training and 3 are for ratting and pubs. And yes i pay monthly for each. Which i am considering to cancel.
---
Was not worth roaming in a nullsec infested with bots working to pos or citadels as soon as a neutral was pinged in intel.u do once u do twice and after that u say:fuck this shit...no worth my time and  money .If ccp want to have serenity 2,dell go ahead....without my money

---
For subcap ratting it can be fun if you fit ready for a fight, but ratting for isk alone in any sub short of a smartbomb fleet, when you have supers its pretty much a lost cause as a way of generating isk. In my eyes anyway, button course there are a few players still that don't have the option. 
---
Im a perfectly content ping warrior and not afraid to admit it. I'll log in when I'm needed or to modify orders

Besides the experience of helping out with a neat tech demo? No. But that's enough for many.

For this one I'd wager the timing of it suggest otherwise.

Ok, got to say this is the first time I've checked your twitter... and while this post is funny, the pic with the shocked baby made me LOL at work. Thanks for that now my team is looking at me like I'm crazy(er).
---
I have two questions, what do you mean by "game plays" , and what is Plex and why shouldn't I sub or not sub with it?
---
You're about to get so much mail now hahaha
---
contrary to popular belief it isn't a steep learning curve.  PVE and PVP are generally 1 or two button affairs.  The difficulty is in getting other people to do what you tell them to fucking do instead of being idiots.
---
Regardless on where you are at on the issue.  Vote with your wallet.  Unsubscribe if you are pissed off.  Sub or buy skins if you like it.   Reddit voting don't count.
---
There is always farmville,
---
Listen EvE was NEVER intended to be a safe spot to be a lazy asshole. you were always supposed to feel like you could lose your ship every time you undock. If you really want to blame someone though. Blame yourself your kind and bots. You abused the shit out of that system so much that CCP had to take drastic action.
---
As a side note whoever invented near2 should be shot out of a cannon.
---
you ice cold muddafuckka
---
Might wanna adjust that tin foil hat guy.
---
Will 0.01 the previous offer so atm that is 0.01 Isk for all your stuff
---
Thanks for the information
---
Nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah, hey hey hey, goodbyeeeeee
---
Well that's pretty much the same argument that PVP players have been using for years now tho.
---
"Player count is the lowest ever"  
---
"Most of the players online are bots"  
---
"Roamed forever and only player I saw was the titan that bosoned me!"
---
That's perhaps not as direct as "I'm unsubbing x accounts", but it's literally the same argument: the state of the game is driving players away.
---
I thought the test server was for spamming your super/cap alts to control a combat point?
---
Cheers bro
---
So basically pve
---
Certainly if you're maximizing for Isk, and equating how much fun you're having in the game to how much isk you're making.   
---
I am a Super-capable pilot, But I used to just top up in a VNI when I had a few hours to crush, or was doing something else. Because Keepstar! That, and the VNI was fit ready for a fight, it was fun to kill some overconfident tackle, or solo hecates.  
---
Never personally smartbomb-ratted, because I don't have multiple accounts. But yeah.  
---
If you're playstyle is specifically making isk with supercapitals, and you're not interested in actually PvPing, then sure, that playstyle is hindered.  
---
**Good**. if you use a Capital to farm your isk and your only defense is the warp-out button to make yourself invulnerable to harm. Sure, that needs a negative.
---
The difference is the PVPers are right and the PVEers are just cry babies
---
Should I conference in NC. and Horde, or have you done that already?
---
Where did rest of picture go?
---
I heard that in large battles players assume roles with each one having an objective, so I'd assume it be a bit retarded out there kek
---

---
On your 1 &amp; 2 ... I have to state that "face value" is a bit difficult when he links to dotlan where you can easily see the statistics of a system over any date you select. it is easy to set that filter to last wednesday to today and see it drop completely from pretty high numbers. You ignoring the options to filter to more than the last 24 hours isn't really OP's fault.
---
All playstyles have seen both buffs and nerfs, but what matters is the overall balance i.e. which playstyles are rewarding and which ones aren't. It's not about exalting one group over others, it's about recognizing reality: the majority is screaming and crying because CCP is finally realizing that only catering to sov null is killing Eve. The more varied the rewarding playstyles, the more people we're likely to have logging in, undocking, and playing the game.
---
Right now, there is a single dominant playstyle: open recruitment, krab-heavy, sov null coalitions. This playstyle creates the most wealth, which in turn creates the most titans, which are essentially the only relevant ships in winning large-scale conflicts due to being horribly balanced against every other class of ship as well as being largely undemanding of individual pilots in terms of requiring skill to fly.
---
Many playstyles have been left to rot into obscurity: mid-sized mercenary groups, lowsec pirates, nano roamers, nomadic groups, NPC nullsec groups, roleplayers, NRDS groups,... the list goes on. You can go back through the history of Eve and find examples of all of these groups who once held great relevance and were part of the fabric of the game: CVA and their awesome wars against Ushra'Khan, the nomadic powerhouse of Pandemic Legion living off passive moon income and mercenary contracts, the rental powers in the GBC, Gunpoint Diplomacy honoring ransoms and duels, Mercenary Coalition as formidable guns for hire, Rooks &amp; Kings with their innovative finesse tactics, etc.
---
Now every relevant group, whether it's The Imperium or PanFam, is a sov-holding entity with a supercapital umbrella, at least one corp that will accept any warm body who applies, and huge amounts of krabbing. I look at every change to the game through the following lens: does it to more to harm or benefit the dominant playstyle, and more or less to re-enable the playstyles which have fallen by the wayside?
---
The local blackout is not going to seriously shake up the mechanics of nullsec, but it's a step in the right direction. Seeing roamers in space again, innovation around the use of recons, and even how the sov null blocs are changing their approach to intel is a good thing. Hopefully there will be a lot more changes to come until the dominant playstyle becomes, whilst still viable, just one of many. Maybe then we'll see resubs tick up instead of down into oblivion.
---
One can only hope.
---
No, The difference is the PVErs are right and the PVPers are just cry babies
---
You would need too make it from scratch as no one has made one and made it public. I made one that gets data from all npc stations in the regions where the main hubs are located with an added sort of calculator that gives you the best buy and sell price for any given item and all without using ESI authentication. I can send it for a couple billion isk, 4 billion unlocked.
---
Depends on what you do friend. I'd you get a character with decent sp you can casually pvp in lowsec, or casually fly a bomber or t3 cruiser around null space or wormhole space and gank people. Exploring can be done pretty casually and has a very low sp requirement actually. I dunno about mining and shit like that, my experience is that requires being in a group, which usually ends up not being casual.
---
He means coding as in programming
---
What if we had a blackout, but having a cyno fitted made you appear in local?
---
So it is LP + chip for BPC?  Or just the chip?
---
&gt;it's been pretty badly managed, either no information or where there is it's being seen as conflicting (indefinite v temporary)
---
There was a 48 hours notice posted everywhere including on the client.  People that think indefinite == forever are ignorant of what the word "indefinite" means
---
&gt;it makes solo pve/indy game play considerably harder, not everyone has/wants 100+ supers on standby so they can mine
---
I believe this is the intended impact, every change will make something worse other than some QoL changes and avoiding changing things just because something gets harder for a % of the player base is how games go into maintenance mode
---
&gt;smaller ship activity (barges/ratting BS etc) is a lot harder, forcing people into carriers or rorqs which some people can't afford or dont want to fly
---
Same as point 2, with an added carriers and rorqs were already the go to other than VNIs which are an unrelated change but Myrs are a pretty good drop in replacement.
---
&gt;local was seen as intel tool for defence but all the attack intel remains intact - in game map, agnecy, anomies on the UI
---
It's also an intel tool for attackers that won't be able to tell if there are bait characters in system or a response fleet
---
&gt;cloaky camping is still a thing and stupidly easy to get into with skill injectors, one person with one account is reasonable but a single person covering a region is stupid.
---
It still amazes me that the game has become so risk adverse that this tactic actually works.  Ask Slyce for pointers on why this has never really worked in their space.
---
&gt;it can be seen as forcing wormhole game play on nullsec, many people don't want that, they want nullsec to be different
---
Yes, because now you need to scan down gates and cynos aren't a thing...
---
&gt;it's can be seen as a cheap fix for a wider issue, all regions need a massive overhaul, this might be part of those changes but more reassurance of other changes coming would be nice.
---
I agree that a larger fix needs done but this is a good stepping stone
---
in large battles, literally one person says shoot this and you hit a button.  plus with TIDI, you have about 5 minutes to wait between hitting the button and when something happens.  
---
again, pvp and pve are simple as shit.  the difficulty is empire building and getting other people to follow you for no other reason that you told them to.
---
You know when I saw this thread title my first thought was that it was going to be some enraged krabber [mailing you guys another bag of dicks](https://np.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/6jvsvm/psa_when_posting_things_to_iceland/)... but that wig, man. That's great too.
---
just out of curiosity, why couldnt you unsub fast enough when they announced the blackout lol? I really dont see what the issue is and only people that seem to be crying is the carebears who have to actually pay 10% more attention now.

CCP should remove heavy drone skills from alphas entirely, the quantity of people using heavy drones for PVP is tiny, ccp should encourage new players to wet their beaks with pvp.

Pretty much this. Capacitor and navigation skills a close second.

What's near2?
---
Who even are you?
---
What's left of the human players of GOTG are now nothing more than guardians of the botters a sad state of affairs tbh but it's not like they have ever been relevant in the grand scheme of things. What objective do the tiny human membership that remains of GOTG have left to fulfil now they have no botters to protect because local has been removed and they no longer undock? At least sort can cuddle up to that goon dick at night when he cries himself to sleep because he realises he's no longer part of the csm and can't cry to ccp to try and get local reinstated and save his botting empire.
---
Just move to high sec,  problem solved
---
&gt;Listen EvE was NEVER intended to be a safe spot to be a lazy asshole. You were always supposed to feel like you could lose your ship every time you undock. If you really want to blame someone though. Blame yourself your kind and bots. You abused the shit out of that system so much that CCP had to take drastic action.
---
This game may be a sandbox but the only authorized playstyle is roaming ganks.    Anything else and you are cancer.   GTFO.
---
(This was sarcasm.)
---
Near2 isn't "basically required" to rat in nullsec, you're just tail averse and think you should be able to make ISK while barely paying attention to the game. There are multiple tools in game that help you stay safe, they just require more effort than being alt tabbed waiting for a ping to alter you to warp out.
---
You're not fucked over with no local, just ask your Bloc leaders that continue to say "lol doesn't even effect us were actually stronger now dumb ccp."
---
There's a ton of reasons to undock, even including to still rat and mine. You're just upset that you can't be a completely safe untouchable entity now, and you might have to align to something or hit dscan and decrease your dank ticks by an insignificant percentage.
---
I feel like I'm beating a dead horse at this point, but there's ton of things you can do casually. You haven't lost the ability to do literally anything besides be afk.
---
CCP has had plenty of communication about this. It was plastered a over the launcher, eve media sites, CCP sites, ect. Falcon has been responding to people talking about it regularly. Your tickets are spam that waste their already understaffed crew's time because you're a crybaby.
---
You don't need some "compensation" back for this, you need to harden the fuck up and actually play the game, when you're playing the game.
---
In the likely event this is a shitpost, there's tons of people who do unironically feel this way and probably need to hear some of that. Thanks for giving me something to do while pooping at work.
---
Fuck you too :P

If you want casual safe gameplay, highsec is for you.  If you want to make bank, stay in nullsec and start playing with others.

It is a Coveter!!   It won't align or tank no matter what you do to it, so just slap on some mining upgrades and one of those asteroid-scanner thingies (can you tell how long it has been since I mined?).
---

Look at plex prices demands grow supply not. That means people selling plex grow way less then buyers. If demand reduce prices go down, u will need less isk to plex account, and market will balance itself. In the long run win everybody, crab need less time to return investment and achieve profit, quality guy will get crab and will be happy.
---
Oh please, please, someone tell me this isn't bait!

---
The timing of it is perfect.  If eve can up there player retention by even a few percent it will replace the lost players in no time.
---
Would be hilarious. I think cyno is super OP. I would also like to see deviate landing vectors the more ships come through. Add 500/1km potential per ship. So by the 20th ship it lands at 10k to 20k away and so on. Also, add time dilation. 2 seconds per ship after the first 10. So ship 20 is in tunnel for 20 seconds. Ship 30 for 60 seconds. Cap it at something like 120 seconds, but add risk to coming out the other end as well.
---
ok so unsub, no one will mess you, good luck in your future adventures. My advice is to stop playing online games if you are going to cry over such little issues.

There used to be a time when Eve was a skill based game you know, and it might go back to that one day!
---
why is eve such a shitty game?
---
Thanks, I see it works good for GSheets, but I'm not sure how to use it for Excel though.  
---
Any thoughts?
---
"The state of the game is bad and I'm not gonna play anymore" is a totally valid reason to quit. I wouldn't tell anyone to not do that. I just returned from a year and a half off two days before Blackout was announced. 
---
The difference is these morons don't want to quit because eve is in a bad spot, they want to quit because they have actual risk instead of perfect safety. And most don't even want to quit, they just think saying so will get something done.

A caveat: when people keep saying null should be dangerous, they do so with a gleam in their eye meaning they are a dangerous hunter. They don't want it to mean deadly and dangerous to them to go hunt there because of a massive defense network.

For some groups super ratting is completely hindered, but for big groups it's so much more fun than before. Right now if I was to go out ratting and get bubbled, I have to light a cyno, jump in my fax and if needed, boson titan and the umbrella follows shortly after. There is still no risk in this case. It just literally sucks the life out of you in terms of time input.
---
That's why I like market trading so much. It's near zero effort and minimal time input for profits that correlate to how much isk you put into it and it sits in a station completely safe making money all day while you can casually log in any time to shoot stuff for a few minutes or a few hours, and then log off when satisfied.

Ya except everyone is implying they only wanted fights. But pve players and the super fleets that wiped you out if you went there still didn't change anything. If you want to pvp go to place where other people wanted to get a good fight, not use overwhelming force to kill you.

Good timing Mr Falcon to divert attention from the failed SP event. But you know, that's pretty basic trick from the PR book. Maybe add some "botters teleported to high-sec" for better impact.
---
so, just use pathfinder?
---
It does indeed punish pve players in nullsec, well done for noticing that. CCP are trying to restore some balance to the isk faucets vs sinks, minerals mined vs minerals destroyed, and risk vs reward. Don't like it? You can always mine in highsec.

I can't speak to the market of plex, I am just saying people paying their subs via plex net ccp more money than those who pay with cash.

You dont make fair fight at home. It s stupid. You blob / powercreep for removing the envy of these guys to come back. When you are at home you are not here for fair fight. Not hard to understand.
---
i see what you did there.
---
Adiós Felicia.
---
Also WoW is still a thing and can I have your stuff?
---
Thats awsome :)
---
This. Alliances like HTP which aren't sprawled over more regions than they can populate will be able to quickly respond with standing fleets and get good PvP out of the blackout.
---
He's talking about the first round of drifter spawns, which proveably did target goons.
---
Event seems to be working for me - claimed my skillpoints across all six accounts today just fine.
---
So people playing the game different than you are less than human is the stance you are taking?
---
I'm doing it with 4.
---
3 would probably be the smallest I would do it with, but 2 is doable.
---
I just think that it could be better to just have 2 combat capable ships instead of the orca if you are using just 2 accounts.
---
Do you even know what a Tortoise is?
---
Hello I'm looking to get involved in the triglavians event, anyone know where I can go to join in on trigvian pewing ? like a group we're I can fleet up with people ?
---
Wow xXxDarkSasuke1999xXx lol!
---
I just have to say your username!
---
Guess I'll go drink some Monster Juice, eat some Hot Pockets, yell at my mom, punch a hole in the drywall, and catch up on My Little Pony episodes so that we can hang out. 
---
xXxDarkSasuke1999xXx lmao!!!
---
Oh man, I better change my creepy name to include "dark" and 42069 or something like that. 
---
Real talk though, is Sasuke the name of your pillow?
---
I haven't been trolled by a 20 year old in years. 
---
Thank you. Thanks 😘
---
!!!
---
WOW
---
So you think people who don't have your play style deserve to be punished. Guess we shouldn't build a sand castle because ccp will just kick it over since it makes you sad.
---
To be fair those were some nice fuckin' biscuits!
---
Ah
---
Are you really a ccp executive?
---
So when everyone is ratting in super carriers as part of the null blocs, who are these 'pvp' players going to hunt. They could have already hunted each other before this change but chose not to.
---
The skills needed to get into capitals.
---
Alternately: Cyno field theory
---
ITT: 95% of commenters got baited.  I mean, even a simply check of OP's post history shows the comment " Local and perfect Intel kill more content than anything" -- I mean, for all the chestbeating about the PVP supremacy and how they play eve on hard mode, you'd think a simply check for bait wouldn't elude them.

Not enough overcropping, git gud skrub
---
Well not developers may be working on solutions, seeing what works best, testing, then offering the bots for sale.
---
Bitters are then debating if it will be worth it to buy the new bots.
---
Many bots may not even realize there was a change and their dead bots are just because of really faster hunters or something else.
---
Lots of places for delays to a bot update being proliferated.

I think that the game balance needs to be restored.

---
Look at this graph, look how much is being produced vs destroyed currently. Isk inflation is similar, if not a bigger issue. This needs addressing; mining and ratting need nerfing.
---
It's too bad she won't live, but then again who does?
---
Bot-aspirants aren't really playing the game, for one thing. Their effect on the economy is clearly harmful as well. Their only redeeming quality is that they make pretty explosions.
---
\&gt; C5 space has been a little bit quiet on the krabbing front. 
---
Erm what holes have you been in lately? Most of the C5 and C6 holes that are not the larger Entities homes are all bear holes...
---
Gross. Sounds like you got a bad case of spod brain. 
---
Careful rorqals are also know to cause cancer.

Experts suggest ripping all skill points out for rorqals and injecting into something that will actually catch you a decent fight.

When I don’t play eve for a day this starts every time

No, lol. The furthest thing from it.

We need an event that removes bad posters from the subreddit
---
&gt;C5 space has been a little bit quiet on the krabbing front.
---
Everyone ratting in supercarriers? I'd love to see that. Got any more fictional world ideas you'd like to share?
---
PCU was down ~2500 day 1
---
Pro- no local: "Thats bots"
---
Day 2- ~4500
---
"That bots"
---
Tbh, we dont actually know if theres a player impact, until we get real data. But bots have been affected and thats is a good thing. Just wish, everyone wasnt bashing each others sides.
---
Reality is, CCP has left their options open. If there is a change to local returning or structures for local....a lot of returning people will leave again. And all these "carebears" you bashing on, if even 1% dont come back thats a net loss for Eve as a whole.
---
Yes this is an experiment, but bashing each other isnt helping in the end. The "F them, we dont need them" mentality towards each other in general is bad. You do need them and their subs, we all do.
---
Can we try not to cheer when people quit or say they are? Idk way too big an ask for reddit i think.
---
I hope this is a positive change. Hope that once my RL calms dpwn i can return myself. We'll see.
---
Keeping a structure fueled is not very diffcult, but I see where you're coming from.
---
Villy pinched my mom on her butt, kicked my dog and screwed my girl. Then he dressed up like Santa and took pictures with my kids.
---
Well I fell for it. Very good bait 👌
---
You win
---
that sounds like a great idea
---
You are damn right. Until the blackout is over, I swear that I won't rat in deklein.
---
Maybe I'm so upset that I won't even do it afterwards.
---
bots are updated. they'll just have to run the newest version and they're good. shockingly few seem to do that tho.
---
I still think it's funny that people think most bots rely on local.
---
Trust no one.
---
Join EVE University, Pandemic Horde, Brave Newbies or another newbro focused corp in a larger alliance. It drastically shortens the learning cliff.
---
Plex is the currency that acts as the conversion tool of real world money --&gt; ISK (The in-game market currency)
---
Basically. You can buy plex using a credit card and then sell it in game for ISK or buy cosmetics with it for your character/ship which you can then ALSO sell on the market.
---
A lot of players get wrapped up in the other thing plex does, which is allow you to turn in for game time. Meaning effectively, you can pay for your account to be full omega status just by playing and buying plex from in-game with isk, and activating it.
---
What they don't realize is (especially now a days) it's not as easy as all that. Margins matter and at a low level, it's hard to earn enough ISK to make that monthly cost, and still have a fun time. 
---
Here is an equation I provide friends.  
---
If you can make more money in real life, and buy your account premium than it would take you in hours in-game to make the isk to do it. Just pay for it.
---
The data is in front of your face, you choose not to see it.
---
Would you say that you're FEDUP?
---
I think it depends on the type of danger. As a hunter, I'd love to run into an engageable defense fleet (subcaps at no more than 3x our numbers), but yeah it's not particularly fun to fight (read: waro away from) 8 supers in navy cruisers.
---
If you define "play the game" as "put a vni in an anom and go play other games, only ever interacting with the game to dock up or move to a new anom, and doing the absolute bare minimum of fleet participation to be allowed to stay doing that indefinitely" then yes, absolutely.
---
That is what CCP is driving nullsec towards with this change. Ratting in something that can be saved.
---
I don't think I ever had one.
---
in 2014 as a month old newb I flew a Retriever, and a Procurer for when Code was in system in Tekaima.   (Thank you Gellente CAS for the Orca boosts!)  
---
I think both are still there.
---
Blackout was a success !
---
Plex payers get the same rewards as sub. Yes, this is a newsflash.
---
Thank you my man, I've just noticed that I don't have salt for the steak I'm preparing. Much appreciated.
---
Spectacular!
---
delet this,
---
Solid guide though.
---
Pvpers don't build anything so they aren't really playing the game. See I can make judgements about groups of people not doing my play style either. You aren't the sole judge of how people should play the game.
---
Tfw miss a fuckload of sp from login events AND blackout this year because deployed
---
Good for you
---
I like this idea (delayed jumps), I'd probably do it based on mass, so a bridged subcap fleet jumps through in a couple of seconds, a cap takes a minute, and a super/titan takes 2-3 minutes.
---
The cemetery structure is quite interesting.
---
Would there be just the one or more? Where would they put it?
---
Author lives in c2 space 😇
---
Reward was already extremely high, this is now the risk part.
---
I do however agree ratting needs a major overhaul. It shouldn't be warp in, toss out drones and go make a coffee. More complex sites that benefit having a variety of ships available should be the norm - and IMO you should have to scan \~70% of them. They should also have a hard limit on how many anoms show up per system.
---
One of many that will do this... the balance has been  tipped far far to the other side..
---
I have good news...CCP will refund you for months unused. You can now stop visiting this sub as well,since you don't like the game. Youre welcome.
---
Worth the effort
---
Go for a Tengu.
---
This isn't based on any sort of technical superiority or characteristics, but you can name it Pingu the Tengu, and that name sounds pretty cool IMO
---
Seems fishy
---
... with a C5 static, iirc.
---
Market PvP is way more brutal then ship PvP
---
&gt;Stop doing this, it's ruining the game.
---
I don't understand the hate for the free skillpoint giveaways.  Now this one in particular makes me sad only because I'd love to see the login numbers for the blackout over a few weeks to see what the community actually thinks of it (and not just who yells loudest on Reddit).  For that reason, i dislike the timing of this particular one.
---
But giving away skill points in general?  Who cares.  it benefits everyone, and it benefits older toons more than newer ones (as injecting skills costs more past 80m).  
---
I don't care much either way, but calling it 'ruining the game' doesn't make much sense to me.
---
Yikes
---
Only the chip. One chip gives you one bpc. When the chip drops, you can basically see on it's value what it is ... so the chip can also be sold on the market, usually for a bit less then the ship itself (basically minus the production costs).
---
I first read that as "... without interruption and any isk" and thought to myself "I am ok with this".
---
Yeah but your judgements are ridiculous, whinging, pathetic stretches of the imagination. Mine are astute analyses of factual information. 
---
I'm probably better looking than you too.
---
They just keep it closed :P 
---
I also know the author and am teasing
---
I guess in my current state I'll just treat Plex more or less as a novelty than a currency I can safely rely on
---
I'll gladly remove those downvote when you remove yours, I've found this entire time that when I don't support the blackout I get down voted by whoever I'm discussing with.
---
What you seem to miss is that this swings the risk reward way off the scale. People keep saying nullsec is safer than highsec or anything else but nullsec always has the most ship losses so it was clearly dangerous. How about instead of creating more incentive to group up under null blocs they make a reason to spread out. All this caused is people can only safely rat with a super and live under an umbrella. Soon all the pvpers will be crying that to many people cyno in to kill them not getting the irony of 200 players wanting them to go away, and instead thinking it's their right to collect shiny killmails.
---
For blops fam.
---
Ok :(
---
Then people would join goons and just do it in perfect safety of their super cap umbrella thus making goons even richer then they already are.

---
automated intel tool
---
Hopefully soon, but there is no word from ccp yet. 
---
Truth is I would expect it to last at least 2-3 weeks intill all the 1337 pvp players start to cry that there is no casual players left in null that they can fight. \[which they will totaly do, just gota look at the kind of replies they post on here and the eve forums to see the type of people they are\]
---
This is a sandbox game and we are both allowed to play as we like. You like to pvp, I like to build empires. You imply anyone who doesn't pvp is less than human and think that's a good arguement. I guess I can't be surprised you don't understand why that's bad but I will explain again.
---
People can play this game however they want and when they don't play your style, they are still people playing the game.
---
Your hostility is misplaced and unnecessary. Clearly you are having a rough day. I hope it improves and you cheer up a bit.
---
power grid management and cpu management need to go
---
but i'd say it's fair that some really tight fits become available as you move forward with your training
---
nice time to remove TIDI &lt;3
---
It was a 3rd party tool that would read a chat log, and when someone reported activity in a system, if that system was a certain number of jumps from your position, it would play a notification.
---
Essentially, as long as you had people reporting intel, you could see enemies coming long before they ever arrived.
---
I'm having trouble deciding on how to train/specialize my alts. I currently have 3 accounts with 4 characters like this:
---
Account 1 (Omega): (A) Main combat character (30mil SP)  
---
Account 2 (Omega): (B) Hauler alt (7mil SP); (C) ??? (5milSP)  
---
Account 3 (Alpha): (D) ??? (2mil SP)  
---
Basically I'm not sure what to do with character C and D. So far I've only trained core skills on both. I live in low sec (gallente FW) and have access to a C3 WH. I am primarily interested in ways to make ISK with my alts.
---
Mate literally look at the event that starts after this week. Login to kill trig ships, and you get sp from doing it.
---
So I need to buy amulets and rip out my high grade slave implants on supercap characters?? Why not make amulets the shield implant instead???
---
Fucking hell CCP this is not cool
---
ThE sTaTe oF eVe
---
I wouldn't put it in the middle of drone lands, rather at one of the ends. Otherwise you're buffing jump freight too much and frankly everything from Curse to the drone lands would suffer as a result.
---
Part of what makes that area great is how hard it is to get shit down there, so more people roam in cheaper ships to make up for it.
---
Why are you the ultimate judge of how people are allowed to play this game?
---
How about we claim you aren't playing the game, you just want to grief people and are not really a player and just a griefer. That would be stupid but I can easily make that claim.
---
**Today i killed a T1 fitted mining barge in nullsec.           
---
I am proud of my accomplishment!**
---
You do realize near 2 was not an official ccp tool. They didn’t “push” it on you.
---
I’m also hoping you realize the no local thing is a temporary event
---
Hotel Eve, where you can check out, but you can never leave......you’ll be back.
---
Confirmed this is going towards Capital Ship 5
---
When I met my girlfriend, I told her “ so what I have to do is click this rock, click the mining lazer, and hang out” (I was goofing around with Eve Uni mining .org at the time).  She looked at me and said... that’s stupid.  Go do stuff.  So I jumped into a combat ship to go do stuff, and there was no stuff going on at the moment.  3 hours later and after she watched a movie she came back and said... “ you do this for fun?” .  She jumped on world of Warcraft for a half hour, did a dungeon, logged off.
---
Can eve be played casually?  Yes.
---
Is eve a game that demands round the clock attention? Yes.
---
Here in my station, just bought this new Munnin here. It’s fun to drive up here in the Geminate hills. But you know what I like more than materialistic things? Showing that I'm in Origin. In fact, I’m a lot more proud of these seven new threads that I posted in under 10 minutes. It’s like Elo Knight says, “the more you cocaine you do, the more you can post."
---
Are you telling me I can krab without local?
---
No your implants will be renamed.
---
its not about eliminating it entirely, but about bringing it into balance with the other things from the perspective of ease:risk:reward. ratting will always still have the advantage that you get guaranteed instantaneous liquid ISK.
---
Bot-aspirants aren't building any empires, so you're clearly trying to twist my words in a direction that I never intended them. All they're doing is shooting at asteroids and NPCs, all day every day, afk or semi-afk. They might occasionally be *useful* to empire builders, as serfs, but they aren't building any empires themselves.
---
&gt;Less isk/hr           
---
No local          
---
whole idea
---
I'm obviously not talking about technical side of event, sure its working ok. I'm just trying to point that whole event is just to cover up decline in number of players logged in. This will not look nice on company monthly report, so you trying to counter that with "login" event.
---
Marauders suck. *rolls around in 300m isk/hr*
---
Yeah I have 2 accounts and dont really fancy having more. I'll plan it out to see if 2 is readable for me
---
A single one?  Sure. In every system you could run a DED in?  That's a substantial time and isk investment.
---
Oh lol
---
No
---

Bots aren't buying PLEX from CCP. I know somebody is buying the PLEX the botter gets for isk. But the people willing to pay for the game aren't suddenly going to be unwilling to pay for it just because the isk value of PLEX went down.
---
Well, VNI/Gila/Ishtar-Bots as well as the totally not bot tool NEAR2 rely on local ... 
---
What Bots do you speak of?
---
Avoid the big nullsec newbie corps, you'll end up with a fixed mentality that the only way to play the game is mindless ratting and mining in 'safe' space. If you want to have fun, head out to faction warfare space, learn PvP in a t1 frigate, and find people to fly with.
---
The key problems at the moment are how easy it is to get into a carrier or rorqual and krab and inflate the economy with ISK faucets and huge ore hauls which whilst they suppress the price somewhat still pull in vast sums of material.
---
Battleships that used to cost 200mil are about 60-70mil cheaper since the rorqual expansion. Sure that's great, they say, but cheap ore also drives capital proliferation because they're also all T1 ships.
---
This is tempered a little by the cost of injectors, which, in theory, are a closed system. The principle was that for every SP trained naturally, some may be destroyed, but none created.
---
This balance gets destroyed every time CCP do these kind of things. 
---
I'm not saying it doesn't help people, it obviously does. But if you gave everyone a million dollars you'd destabilise the economy, and that's bad.
---
Similarly, just because a lot of people benefit from something doesn't make it good for the game.
---
I for one love the blackout and would love to see more people logging in. This doesn't even achieve that as you can claim these rewards without even logging in!
---
So whatever the design goals, they fail.
---
Ok, prove it then
---
Missile launcher, neut highs, ecm/target painter mids, signal amp and armor plate lows.
---
Drop a reactor on it but only run that when you have a stockpile of gas, or are running constant reactions. Drop it around 50-100km from the moon mining beacon. Use procurors so they can survive a loki long enough it can lock it and make it bugger off.(40 seconds or so)

---
Well then EVE is not your game, as there will never be divided "realms". It would hurt all core principles of this game ...
---
The leaders of team amarrica have enough money to buy and sell the whole minmatar militia, so we rolled all those gyros, for this one fleet. Not that expensive for us. But it got us the results we wanted.
---
Hello mister bot programmer I'm sure you know lots and lots about how bots work and what's realistic to do. I'm definitely going to run a Nyx/Carrier bot using DSCAN and a gate scout, and I'm definitely not just going to have someone seed my system and cyno ahead of me in warp.
---
no it's not possible you auto die to elite pvpers the second you undock and then they bang your girl
---
These wild excavators must feed on their spodmium rocks nightly. However they  have been spotted by a flock of nemesis bombers. Laying in wait they spring their salt bombs at the most opportune moment. The mother rorqual manages to pull the baby drones into its protective sack before the bombs explode. 
---
However there are other predators watching. A scavenger Loki uses it's long tentacle webs an hour later to pick off the slowest baby drone.
---
Yeah they have only been talking about that for 5 years
---
Does this change mean that I'm valuable for sitting in a Helios with combat probes out and corp chat open?

my bad, when i opened the thread there was the OP and one other comment - both had dotlan links, i mixed up which was which and was thinking about querious writing that comment.
---
Neuts, ecm, and a signal amplifier. Will be infinitely more useful than the guns if anyone actually tries to shoot it.
---
Easier to waste your attackers time and frustrate them into leaving than actually blowing them up. 
---
If any hostiles have logi ecm the fuck outa them. If they have oracles neut the fuck outa them. If they have drone boats throw an alt in some annoying shit like a sniping tengu and pop their drones while ecming them from the structure.  
---
If you fit a missile launcher on an athanor you might as well be throwing wet noodles at your enemies.  
---
The bomb launcher is nice to have tho. 
---
Plus if the worst happen and they don't leave  being able to neut out their tank and interrupt any remote reps will help u kill them way faster. 
---
Realistically tho if you keep the thing fuelled and online then the chances of someone bashing it are low unless you've pissed someone off somehow.

I mean it matters for new players, 500k sp is a lot for them
---
I'll find drans post but basically the first wave of drifters spawned in set systems after a downtime and didnt change, just keep using those exact systems. Most groups had about 3 per region with many regions having 0 and delve had 20. Either ccp randomly spawned these and got lucky only picking system near null bloc main systems or they picked the systems and choose to give goons 10x more to deal with.
---
I'm not saying they're completely useless, but for the ISK investment you can find something better.
---
Having 1488 in your name is a great way to show that anything you say will be asinine.
---
and it was balanced given that VNI ratting was pretty 'meh' reward.

No 😭😭😭

It's an overwhelming success! All the old Bois are logging back in amirite?? Say anything else and I'll fight you

I will accept it wasn't you, but you will see in the rest of this post that all of mine were down voted.
---
The whole issue thus local change doesn't fix anything and only serves to punish. It doesn't serve to balance or improve game play.
---
Do you ignore your static 5?
---
They’re hardly dead on the krabbing side of things and definitely more likely to run into someone in a 5 than a 3
---
i know - i was mainly highlighting the issue that in terms of risk/reward an umbrella isn't going to do much for a subcap even if it is an umbrella of other subcaps.

Its not my fault that Hisec today is more risky than Delve. Last week I had my eleventh corp membership birthday in the corp I joined 2 years after starting EVE. How are you mate?

Oh, so you edited last weeks meme? Still pretty lame.

you could, but i wanted more information then most application offer and its gonna be a bit larger then it is right now. But everyone has their preferred application, it cannot harm anyone to have more options.

&gt;We’ll be hosting the Phase Two battle on Sunday, August 18th, 2019 at 13:00 EDT / 17:00 UTC. This is a date and time selected based on feedback from the EVE community following the original EVE: Aether Wars playtest, as we want as many pilots from New Eden as possible to take part.

Then it's just completely off topic.

Well and the counter to this denying gameplay is GANKS, simple as that. But that isnt fair too and the op of this branch cried about that. Sov-Null really has become pathetically soft ...
---
And if that is how they want to play what is wrong with that?
---
Not everyone has to have a play style you approve of.
---
Lows sec.still has local
---
&gt; they have actual risk instead of perfect safety 
---
You do realize this is a ridiculous statement, right? There has never been perfect safety. That's just nonsense. Even before the blackout people died constantly even in the safest regions of null-sec. - People who were smart and prepared for the risks had a good chance of surviving, but that's not some mechanical deficiency in the game just people playing it as they should have. Even "purely" PVP players act to minimize the risk of them losing their shit. Today the same applies, and people who live in those same safe regions can still krab in relative safety if they are smart about it.
---
People quitting or staying offline over this change aren't doing so because *finally some risk was added*, but rather because for a lot of players this change increased the risk by a massive factor while the rewards stayed the same. For players not capital/super krabbing, or trying to krab outside of a super umbrella, the risk simply isn't worth the rewards anymore.
---
For many of us the effort required to put in even minimal krabbing is just too high for the income it generates, so we've turned to different things; other ways to play. I still play on a couple of my accounts, mostly doing PVP things, but I've cancelled others. Not because I was under any delusion that CCP gave a shit, but because they are completely useless now.

It's like USA going to Iran and say k let's have a fair fight you bring 3 fishing bouts and we bring same, no these doesn't happen in the real world the gold standard is overwhelming firepower you don't go for fair fights and killing afk vnis isn't pvp
---
Test tried to deploy an offensive fortizar in frat staging and in the system next door. Both were killed.
---
MJD anything, isn't fun to try and catch. They need to introduce more scrams in Sleeper sites.
---
   
---
I remember when there was a massive bug and the Sleepers would intant aggro drones. It was brilliant because we were seeing more Dreads and Marauders in sites. 
---
It's a moot point though, because we regularly see people bearing it up in C5 space in Snakes and Nestors. I'm surprised Leshaks haven't become more popular. And that was my initial point, from what I have been seeing, C5 space isn't quiet on the Krabbing front.
---
Seriously, CCP already has my money. I don't _need_ to log in.

Bbtb has been having a field day with the blackout. I'm sure I can ping my Corpmate and confirm he didn't sent is as a nefarious ccp plot.
---
That said, can I have what you're smoking?
---
Turtling up doesn't stop you going on roams.
---
Inter-CCP wars, started they have.
---
Well, ratting is not a problem, the problem is that it's pretty easy to rat. They should introduce mechanics so you can't warp in with a VNI and let the drones finish the job.
---
Are you dense? Where did I say I buy plex ingame XD?
---
I said exactly the opposite, I buy them with cash from CCP and sell them ingame to get ISK as I hate tedious, boring and repetitive PvE-Tasks.
---
Totes.   
---
I mean just go look up all the EVE marketing videos that glamorize wormhole style small gang PVP.   
---
Soooo many more than all those lame giant nullsec fleet battles. I'm sure the new players that will sustain this aging player base are flocking in and foaming at the teeth because there's a blackout in nullsec.
---
I played years ago, and despite promises to myself I want to return. The biggest thing that stops me is the knowledge that I'll have to skill up all over again given that I'd like to be on a fresh account if I can't rename the old one (no bad history, just a somewhat lame name I don't care for). If wolf packs are still a thing I know I could get rolling with fun PvP pretty quickly on a new account...  would this be a very good time?  
---
Maybe I should just revive the old account and deal with it.
---
Please, ELI5!
---
Is it eve64bit? A separate game?
---
Low Sec never lost local
---
 Maybe krabs there?

This. 
---
The ISK/hr is unbeatable.
---
2 could also be more doable with a deep space transport or blockade runner instead of an orca.
---
Obviously no reshipping, but that could handle loot and ammo trucking.
---
A lot safer and cheaper than the orca. It could be a nice test with lower commitment to plan out and try.
---
Then see if you have more use case for just shorter trips with 2 combat ships, the ability to reship in an orca, or maybe if that's the perfect set up for you.
---
Having full flights of battleship sized drones on cruisers was a mistake to begin with
---
Do you writes these questions yourself?
---
The blackout put eve back on the media radar. I wouldn't be surprised if there were a surge if new accounts and new players...
---
Lol
---
You don't know who sent it, despite a signed card that you photographed?
---
Lmfao I love this sub haha
---
Keep stars should be capturable that is the only asset safety we ned
---
What's wrong with that is that they pump too much isk and too many minerals into the economy, fucking over everyone with their greed. 
---
And apart from that, they constantly lobby CCP to nerf all other playstyles in favor of theirs. And CCP generally obliges! The blackout is the first and only time CCP has ever changed the game in a way which inconveniences bot-aspirants, following literally hundreds of nerfs to PvP over the years, intended to please them.
---
i guess i assumed you were new because you know so little about the game v0v
---
You do know that people pay more attention than "x people logged in" right? Like how long people logged in for?
---
Oh ok. Do you at least work for the company?
---
keep at it brother
---
and you think reddit can fix this?
---
&gt; killing afk vnis isn't pvp
---
It isn't because the VNI is often not piloted by a player, you are right.
---
As long as it is "just multiboxed" with "very high apm" its PvP, as it is a "Player" being shot by a "Player". That ist the 100% definition of PvP. What you speak of is consensual PvP, and this is against the core principles of this game ...
---
Ignoring the fact that "staying under the umbrella", as you said, means NOT leaving that umbrella.... how does that equate to your above bullshit statement?
---
And ignoring that bullshit, what about scouting enemy territory for fights?  How does that equal "staying under the umbrella"?
---
Unless you mean THEIR umbrella, you fucking tool?  Lol
---
Honestly this change made the game look too interesting again for me to avoid it after years since my last login... I always felt it was a shame that no one had to do any real work to identify other occupants in null. I'm just coming back after this news and realizing tons of people hate the change, though I haven't read enough dialogue to get the full reasoning for that yet.
---
For each account you cancel, three rough riding PVPers will take their place.
---
Daily reminder that high sec still has local. Maybe you should head on back.
---
Welcome to the Hair Club For Men!
---
&gt; we have found that the account security has been willfully compromised as a result of account sharing or attempted account transfer between multiple parties
---
That seems pretty authoritative to me.
---
:P
---
Ratting certainly has been a problem, but perhaps post-blackout things will be better balanced. We'll have to wait and see how players (and bots) adapt.
---
I bet the previous one was also to counter the dropped log in count from blackout.

Well yeah I don't know my man, just don't take every crappy public contract you see, start working for Red/Blackfrog, or at least hang out in Haulers Channel, very reasonable rates there. Or better yet, haul for yourself, join a nullsec space guild and import goods, then sell them for a very nice margin.

I could run dual T3s and re-rig as required using a mobile depo. My alt fly's a dst so that may be viable. I'll need to sit an plan this out as it sound like a good little project.

In most civilized USTZ countries, employers are required to provide you a 15 minute break and a 30 minute lunch for every 4 hours worked. This means you have approximately an hour at each job to click a link and find that the second round of Aether Wars takes place on Sunday, August 18th at 1300 EDT.
---
I actually checked in the time it took me to write this shitpost.
---
Ps: I hope you drive a minivan.
---
If that is the case, then the login stats for last weekend paint a pretty dismal picture.
---
your argument is invalid, sp is not what it used to be, injectors..... you can catch up in anything with enough starting isk.
---
ah i see you are interested in becoming a wormholer
---
Posting GM correspondence to reddit isn't going to help your case. That's strictly forbidden...
---
A sensible post. Is there a save button?
---
Can we have them in Eve please, no need to stop shaking the sand tray now.
---
Came here to post this. The first thing I ever did in EvE was finding mission runners in a battleship, bait them into shooting me by stealing their loot, kitey-bullshit them to death.
---
They don't have jokes where you live?
---
Technically, yes.  In practice, not really.
---
I am not awesome. I know this because I used to make video games for a living--specifically MMOs--and it was during that time I realized the industry had transformed me into an uncaring douche nozel contemptuous of the actual players of my game. 
---
Back then, around 2007, I was convinced CCP was different. Now... I am not so sure. 
---
Anyway, I do appreciate that you guys at least try to engage with the community!
---
Pearl abyss, I wanna buy pets that loot for me in eve, hook me up!
---
I like how still refuse to refer to them as people. You will never have a fair opinion until you drop this bot attitude. And you act as if CCP hasn't changed mining or anomalies repeatedly recently to reduce that.
---
They also added the ability to buy skill points for isk, so it's also possible to grind your way to the skills you need.
---
Not really anymore, they clarified that some time ago.
---
Like a dread
---
I understand where you're coming from because medium sized primarily subcap groups like Provi are going to have a hard time with this patch and you were never the ones who had the obscene reward to minimal risk setup that the bigger coalitions do. The issue is, and has for a long time been, supercap umbrellas and the lack of risk for 2 APM Rorq multiboxers under them.
---
Having said that, you're as much to blame for that as anyone else. You banned supercap ratting across a whole region, no one bought supercaps because they can't use them to krab, and now you're being terrorized by a force a quarter of your size but with a super fleet they're not afraid to drop on you at every opportunity.
---
I'm hoping, though not holding my breath, that CCP will do something to address how easy it is to dump a supercap fleet on the field. Until then I'd suggest subsidising any and all supers/titans your members buy and trying to get proper coverage so HTP and friends can't drop with impunity.
---
Aaah. Is that not sweet. The autistic nerds have all ganged up together to be nasty. Bless. Your mothers must be proud of you all in your basements.

Hmm did you see the afk in that comment
---
would have never happened without blackout!
---
Now I don't have to tell you good folks what's been happening in our beloved little game. Local murdered, crops burned, stores looted, people stampeded, and cattle raped. The time has come to act, and act fast. I'm leaving.
---
Well, it does seem pretty clear that they have evidence that you were in fact sharing your account information. 
---
And they are known to have helped a lot of people that was hacked and drained of their SP (they do take a lot of time to do so, but they do eventually, according to several posts I've seen on reddit over the years at least), so I'm guessing that if they are rejecting your request they must have something on you.
---
He does
---
Koreans made CCP sell foreskins... And people not complayning enough. The game is truly dying. Gonna subscribe again, cause gramps left and PLEX is cheap.
---
it's not worth it anymore to rat in a subcap, and dscan only helps so much - people just look up an active pve system on the map, then fly cloaked from anom to anom. too much risk for very low reward, doing abyssals in hisec is way more profitable now.
---
Oh yeah, well when I was in Toronto I ran into Villy at Pixels and Pints. We played street fighter together, and I killed using Ryu, and Villy responded by calling me "an underhanded faggot"--he was screaming it at me, mind you--and then he complained that I did not even give him a reach around.
---
I'm in the same situation, previous extracted all the sp from my old accounts but just in case I do return I am kinda tempted just to log them in for that free SP every day.
---
So I guess it's working for them if they're stat padding.
---
Small gang was my *jam*! Wolf packs, blops, HACs, command ships, logi, lone Pilgrim play -- it took me over 2 years of play before anyone convinced me to even train battleship skills.
---
Wah can’t afk plex wah
---
I never did. The only indication I got that I was hacked besides being banned was that someone from Ukraine was on my account.
---
Didnt it start with a pizza like a decade ago or so?
---
No! Don't say such hurtful things. They're all bots!! 
---
Why the players who pay for subs act like being risk averse while someone rats/mines/ does PI for theirs is some kind of mortal sin, I'll never understand. 
---
&gt;Hurr durr risk averse
---
Yeah but they'll be risk averse when a friendly neighborhood super fleet drop on them on the way home. 
---
This sub has too many idiots flying blinged, top tier subcaps to hunt basic mining/ratting ships, then crying when a blinged cap fleet does to them what they did to the newbro in his 150dps vexor.
---
There is perfect safety if you want it. I'm not sure if you want to discuss pre or post blackout, but it doesn't matter either way.
---
 Being aligned will always keep you safe. Someone in local? Plenty of time to GTFO.
---
X heLachesis and recon ships don't show up you can't tell they're there!!" They have to land in grid. If you're aligned it's quite easy to warp out. Hell you have enough time to get out even if you're sitting at 0.
---
"Sabres can log off trap you easy!" Just be aligned, paying attention, and get out.
---
"b-but what about bombers that can instalock you!!!!" Do you know how aids it is to move a bomber, cloaked, to be within tackle range, of someone who is moving around the grid with a prop mod? I'll concede that there is an infinitesimal chance you may actually run into the bomber while he's cloaked, so sure many not absolute safety.
---
Only the isk positive ones
---
i don't know. i am not stupid enough to think what consequences the blackout will bring to all the aspects of the game. but it helped, that's all that matters.
---

If any kind of light tackle gets on you then you’re screwed. The application is pretty shit. Sure it can gank alright but it can’t fight. The drone rlml legion can kite killing small stuff and still gank.

I think it's  a needed step to counter botting, but have they written any articles or releases to help explain how they balance their antibotting measures against hurting actual players? Also have they considered grandfathering in current alphas that can fly t2 mediums? Assuming this is designed to counter botting that would leave current players somewhat unharmed and make it so after the next banwave botters would be relegated to faction mediums.
---
Oh, I'd never heard of it before =p
---
don't do account sharing
---
I have a friend that lives near me who bots, and his new bots actually use the tensor cores on his Nvidia GPU to identify things on the screen, so they don't rely on text from the overview to react.
---
So his Intel bot is the one that impressed me, it was smart enough to not only tell you that something jumped through the gate, but it could actively try to follow that Target using dscan, and if it was going in the direction of the work bots (his miners) they would head to safety.
---
It was really cool to watch.
---
He told me they could do a lot more things, like apparently it had a mode where if it was a hostile that jumped through the gate it could attempt to bubble it, when using a dicter.
---
He said they worked just as well being set near a wormhole.
---
Next time I visit, he was telling me on the phone he got his new mining bots, so I can see what changed on those.
---
t5 abyss cant be botted like l4 distro missions

Bonus Meme
---
Remember when CCP recieved box full of dick-candies?
---
On the one hand, probably.
---
On the other hand, entirely possible CCP is fucking up.
---
Should have reported it when that happened tbh.
---
I do subcap PvE and without local i have no way to play without being deleted. It’s not a question of paying attention. When someone warps in on me in a belt in a covetor i die, end of story. That’s not fun. Why would I play a game that isn’t fun?
---
I’ve not been crying about it. I don’t have any PvP toons and I don’t enjoy it. It’s not worth the reward to undock a subcap to make next to nothing chewing spod. It will cost me more in lost ships than it will in ore I extract. So I’m not logging in. It is what it is and I’m glad other people are having fun!
---
Get +5’s and then train spaceship command 5.
---
not necessarily. all the multiboxers probably stayed away, and there were big swathes of space that were basically empty, presumably because the bots were not logged in. if anything, the lower numbers of characters logged in (not necessarily of humans at their keyboards though) might actually be a good thing for the game as a whole. and thats not to say anything of the long term effect. EvE has stayed relevant and somewhat popular because it has player driven narratives that generate drama, media coverage and ultimately sell the game experience. If the blackout leads to increased player driven intrigue and conflict, this might have a big effect on attracting and retaining new players. 
---
so perhaps the stats you were used to are highly inflated, and that the blackout presented a more realistic picture of how many humans are behind their computers playing the game.
---
Cool not your diary though
---
See, I don't think I could ever transform that way personally.
---
I spent a decade as a highly visible EVE player and the community will always stay at the front of my mind. I always want to keep roots there, because that's where I came from.
---
I think one of my biggest problems at CCP is that I tend to be too direct in defense of the community's point of view sometimes, and also sometimes I'm just too direct in general if I think something's a shit idea.
---
Do I i think there are some asshats among our players? Absolutely. There's asshats in every community - I'm one myself at times. I think we all have those moments, it's human nature. I stand by my statement that we have the most amazing community in online gaming. When I stop believing that is when I'll move on to do something else. I can't see that happening at this stage in my life.
---
I tend to have those moments of asshattery at the same time as our players do - when I feel like someone's going to do something bad for EVE. That's when the growling starts and when I get a bit too direct for my own good sometimes. Regardless though, I'll always put the health of EVE and the community first - that's kinda what you have to do in this role.
---
That said, if you were on the dev side I can totally appreciate feeling like you're at odds with your players - there's always a tradeoff between creating a healthy, sustainable game, and giving into the chaos that your customers want the game to be.
---
It's all about finding that balance man, I don't think I could ever get to the point where I held contempt for our players. In the end, I respect the fact that our pilots pay my salary, and I quite like having money at the end of the month.
---
Well, apart from /u/Jibrish - screw that guy &lt;3
---
&gt; how does that equate to your above bullshit statement?
---
because roaming, which is what always happens, has nothing to do with blackout.
---
Yep!
---
what about having battleship sized weapons on a frigate?
---
Tell ya what, this is nothing but good news to me. Started playing a month and a half ago, just went Omega this week. Haven't had a day yet where I didn't log in for even a bit and don't plan to now. I just hope it's a special occasion sort of thing and not the prototype of something like BDO's log-in rewards. One of the reasons I stopped playing it was forced daily tasks to do the things I wanted to do. Like building a badass sailing ship, for example. I had to carry a pair of boxes down a flight of stairs to the dock for a dude that never leaves on his expedition. Daily quest, need to do it 30 times for the one ship or 25 for the other. Bullshit.
---
Always a possibility, but he can't do much besides asking for the case to be evaluated again by a different GM (if you can even do that).
---
If you're flying in New Eden space "defenseless", that's your fucking problem, not his.
---
kid next time keybind your d.scan
---
Why are you the judge of this?
---
In short, you are risk-averse.... you want to make isk without risk one of the old saying in Eve "RISK=ISK". Nah don't bother resubbing.
---
Claim all you want buddy :)
---
Yeah scram idea has been tossed around by most WH groups and seems like a good step to help with untouchable BS ratting, but maybe say it still doesn't incentivize capital ratting.
---
It's not that people aren't ratting, it's that (like null) they're nearly impossible to catch if they're paying attention.
---
So the perfect safety with local and 1 person afk cloaked is complelty gone. And that must also mean no one ever died before local was gone because it was completely safe.
---
There are cloaky PVP tengu fits that can run c3 sites that aren't wildly expensive.
---
So you could fit like that and hunt/scan/pve all with no refits.
---
Credit card and your are up to date , like every player who starts the game from scratch nowadays, skillinjectors4w
---
Wrong, it's not gone. I just explained how cloaky camping is easily countered when ratting. Allow me to say again, IF YOURE PAYING ATTENTION AND ALIGNED, YOU DONT GET CAUGHT.
---
Yes. These groups have a very specific way of playing, which is mass PvE in the safest space in nullsec. Horde and Brave less than Karma and Dreddit, but if you got bored before, being a part of nullbloc wont make you less bored now.
---
Maybe if I submitted another ticket? I don't know but I hope.
---
Jesus Christ
---
They have said that all slaves are being swapped to amulets for this exact reason. Your pods are fine.
---
yeah that Jibrish guy's a douche
---
I mean thats all possible, but its just not good enough isk compared to the alternatives that are way less risky.
---
Read the text. I wasn't playing when it happened and only found out about it when I decided to come back.
---
People can say the state of the game is bad because of the local change. You don't get to be the sole decider here. And how can you know most didn't actually cancel their accounts? Everyone on the pro blackout side seems to have massive amounts of information that isn't provided and have never been able to share it.
---
Well let's not forget CCPs ability to get things wrong on many occasions , right..
---
So every pvp player who quit playing because they didn't like changes made was reasonable but when someone doesn't support the blackout change they are a clown? And you don't understand the hypocrisy?
---
I think it’s to test the cushion of people that progress through and play vs the people who weren’t logged in who just grab and go. 
---
Those who stopped logging in on blackout day but still log in for rewards would be a fair proxy for people that you stand to lose if a blackout were permanent. They are engaged with the game but actively not logging for the whole period. This provides potentially useful information when put into context with a whole host of other useful metrics that I’m sure are gathered by the CCP data goblins.
---
I love how people will downvote you and say bullshit, but I find it cool CCP target goons like that, I used to be a pro goons but now I just want to see them die to then come back because it's not funny to win the game right now
---
Not sure that will work, but I don't see any other way you could solve this if you are telling the truth.
---
hahaha &lt;3
---
I think in addition to botting its also an area that alphas may be "too good" at, and we want to walk them back a little more. Right now a alpha VNI ratter isnt significantly worse off than a omega one, and that gap may need some widening.  
---
Skill grandfathering is easier done with ships since they often hav a single skill thats needed to use them, but drones dont mirror that functionality, so grandfathering would require new skills or some non trivial backend work.
---
This may be helpful to you: https://wiki.zansha.space/index.php/SSO_Authentication_in_Microsoft_Power_Query
---
Yes because this is being critical of goons. This is being critical of anyone who doesn't support it and trying to score free karma because most of reddit doesn't support it.
---
They can and should if they believe that, again I'm not against it. But it's the pouty childish attitude that people flock to when they aren't getting their way. I don't have hard numbers about how many quit, just the instinct that anyone with dozens of accounts probably feels too invested to just walk away over a temporary change. I could be totally wrong and they are quitting, I still don't care though lol
---
If it's intended to also hit alpha players then yeah I have no problems with it, would still be interested in hearing them talk about how they try to hit bots and not players with changes if they haven't already.
---
People made bots use local because it was there and simple, people are going to make bots use D-scan, but at least that has counter plays (like recon/cloak) The counter play to local memory reading was forcing the bot off field, and logging off in the belt and logging back in 10 minutes later
---
I think I'll find a suitable one that's better than what you're describing, if not I'll join the usual ones until I get the ropes then see what to do from there
---
Some of you retards are so gullible.
---
Thanks Dr Phil but I'm fine, just trying to do my part to alleviate the burden you must feel from being forced to partake in something you don't enjoy!
---
That is clearly what people who don't agree with this are saying.
---
Let's try the reverse, pvp players only want shiny kill mails with no danger of being attacked while they collect it.
---
Oh, bless your poor little victimized hearts.
---
Eve 64bit is already a thing. 
---
Afaik, Aether Wars is a tech demo for the "aether engine" that's supposed to allow for thousands of players in the same map/area without the need for tidi. If it's proven to do what Hadean claims, then it could be a game changer for Eve.
---
Find me one person who seriously suggested that.
---
I said the same thing about the AT nerds that were "quitting" over no AT. To be clear, I don't think quitting is bad. I think trying to manipulate CCP by saying you will is the bit that makes you a fucking clown. If you're going to quit, you do it, not post about it multiple times.
---
Check out Red vs Blue for a starter Corp, they just went into faction warfare.
---
Clearly proving you don't understand what I wrote.
---
I was in a similar boat as you, 2 months back when I re-subbed.  Had a few 2003 era mains that were "known", and I haven't played seriously since 2012.  Wanted to start completely fresh, make new friends, as it'd be a serious re-learning process for me, and most of the old guard has long gone, or moved on to pastures I want no part of (PF, GSF... I don't like the big block play style, not my thing).
---
I ended up buying some Skill Extractors for cash, and extracted out two 150M+ SP characters.  
---
I have a bunch of unused/unknown alts with low skill points.  I've used some of those full injectors to skill one alt up for a Stealth Bomber, one up for T3 Cruisers, etc.  Have about 15 characters/accounts right now, all around 10-50M.
---
So, either sell your old character for ISK on the trading market, or buy some extractors, tear down your old one(s), and make a new character to quickly(*)skill up to do what you want to do using injectors.
---
* not too quickly, or you'll end up in the same boat of Overskilled For Actual Ability.
---
I farm Nunyas.

GOOBA GOBBLE GOOBA GOBBLE
---
Sweet thanks dude
---
The answer to your argument is that over the entirety of this game's history, your "play" style was not what this game was about. People are right to say "go play wow/whatever" because there is only one eve. 
---
You risk averse nullbears are relatively new, and you're choking this game to death in ways you can't even comprehend because you only joined when this game catered to you. You don't even understand what had to die in order to give you your creative mode space minecraft experience. It's not that we don't want you to play your way, it's that we absolutely don't give a shit if these changes hurt your play style, especially since you've had your dicks sucked by ccp for 3 years at the expense of everyone else. And when you get the nerf, you bitch louder than anyone because you were always too soft to play this game, you just didn't know it.
---
Ya they don't understand nullsec stopped fighting during that because explicitly targeting one group is not ok and we agree.
---
I'd argue that 100mn hams is much more capable of taking actual fights than rlml honestly, plus you have bonused drones for shedding tackle. RLML is of course going to be superior for deleting small stuff but that's what that broken weapon system is designed for.
---
But the ISK/dollar is not very good.
---
For an alpha if they had access to drone interfacing 5, it alone would take without a remap 59.259 days to train for just level 5. Right now Drone interfacing 4 only takes 22.308 days including the need for Drones 5.
---
Changing Drone interfacing from level 4 to 3 takes off 8.623 days.
---
So you're quitting because its hard?
---
But the dollar/hr is infinitely higher than anything you can do in game.
---
Thank you! I literally can't find anything about the thing:)
---
Then why are you insisting you know what people are doing or thinking, and if you as say people are free to think this change is bad for the game and quit because of it why do you originally imply they aren't quiting because of that. Your reply here is a much more reasonable stnace but it completely contradicts your first post.
---
I was thinking the same thing. Nothing of value lost.
---
Nunya Bidness!
---
You can extract half your old skillpoints and inject them in a new character at cost-neutral.
---
Saw a random YT video about this change, and boom, here I am... I haven't resubbed yet, after years of absence, but I'm *looking on with intense interest.*
---
Every time I tell a friend about a sweet spot to sell something in bulk, she tells me to look out or someone will .01 ISK me. I have to chuckle a bit because I'm totally uninterested in playing that game. If you undercut by a large enough margin and sell in a slightly less crowded market, you'll sell out before someone gets you back.
---
Protip I'm not a goon, and this wasn't even about what stance I have on this. As the OP said this is an easy karma grab because reddit supports the local blackout.
---
And you normally don't have the spare mid slot for a scram or web, so good luck hitting the tackler with ham
---
lol HTP &amp; Co. aren't "terrorizing" anybody. They only have the upper hand in their own TZ, and we in our. Those weird times in between can go either way. It's kind of a stalemate at this point due to the TZ differences. Only time anything really happens is when somebody batphones somebody. Otherwise it's mostly just troll entosis and reinforcements.
---
test will let us know, i guess..
---
I hope you've stockpiled those sansha LP
---
Yeah, so this seems like the first step(?) on a path to making NS easier to get into, but harder to keep. I mean, we are still talking about local chat here.   
---
I've never seen a game where "local chat" is the game-breaking mechanic that defines the meta so hard, and I think it's reasonable to assume that local wasn't originally intended to be a powerful tool for PvP, that's just kind of an organic thing that happened as far as CCP is concerned.   
---
"Nerfing" NS isn't *really* a thing that I want either.... I don't know how else to describe it though. I mean, CCP could just straight-up remove a bunch of the content in null sec and I don't think that would go over better than this, and who wants them to just pull content from the game?  
---
The big issues with null sec, I think, are different. Massive capital umbrellas that cyno gank everyone they can sound like bullshit. That will need to be fixed (in my opinion) before I wanna go make my own run at taking some null, but no local sounds like something that would help too, if just by making finding other players in the system an active task rather than a passive one.  
---
It's also something that, I just don't see how it effects the little guy more.... Maybe you think of the "the little guy" as the small corp of players with only a few capital pilots who are trying to make it in null, but I think of "the little guy" as the guy who sees 90+d in his training time to capitals.  The little guy, as far as I'm concerned, doesn't have access to capital ships.   
---
VNI ratting havens isn't something that I do, but I think that this seems to be a really hard hit against those players too. I'm betting that's a major source of income for the "little guy" I'm talking about, but I don't see VNI ratting havens as something that totally makes sense to begin with so it's kind of cheesy play in my head and I don't see it going away as a bad thing.  
---
Look man, I don't know what the fuck CCP was thinking with the Drifter stuff but this all seems like "raising the rent" on null sec space if that makes sense. I do think of Sov null as one of the most valuable things in the game, and making keeping is more "expensive" across the board by increasing the isk and time to maintain it seems like a good way of adjusting the value/profits of sovereignty. Hopefully, there really are more changes to come.   
---
Old place holders or not, the idea of special Upwell structures needed to give you local, navigation, player per system count, ect. sound like good stuff to me as far as helping the little guy day-trip or make a run at quietly taking some of null. Raising the inherent cost of keeping null and lowering power of passive defense in null also seem like ways of adjusting the risk and increasing the need for active play out there too.  
---
 I'm too new to make those kinds of calls, but there seems to be a coherent logic here that I can Imagine CCP is trying to follow and I don't hate them for *trying*. Maybe I'm missing the nuance (I expect I am to at least some degree) and maybe CCP just has their heads up their asses, there's certainly some ham-handedness on their part with the way they're adjusting things, but it seems like there's a good-faith, non-jerk logic behind what they're doing from where I'm standing.   
---
Not being involved keeps me from having the most relevant opinion. Wether CCP is trying to fix null or not, I oped for having to deal with the stress of no asset safety for my stations in wh space over null politics, and no local is a thing I chose so, I'm probably bias.
---
thanks, this is what i was looking for
---
I'm addressing the people that are doing multiple posts about it, and waving their arms in the air. I truly do believe they're full of shit, and not quitting because they don't want to play. I don't think I was addressing people who were just done.
---
Everyone always says vote with your wallet but when people actually vote with their wallet in a way reddit doesn't support that makes them clowns. I'm sure you can see the problem here.
---
If you want immunity from criticism of goons, just go to Imperium News Network. There's an article on there about the blackout I"m sure you'll agree with.

He probably doesn't know all the local shitposters by reddit username.

I am not, unfortunately.  Other people are telling me that its pretty much impossible to join a half-decent pvp corp w/o voice.  I would bring the concept up to my parents but I would be smote with the force of god.
---
How do you not understand this isn't about goons and is about anyone who doesn't support the change?

So, wait... you've already decided to quit, during this TEST, where nothing has been decided so far?

You just need SSO auth, they should have a plug in. That being said, you won't be able to do what you want unless you are in sov space or using player owned structures. Check out Evernus as well - (Someone is recreating it, but I think its exactly what you want)

I'd be interested in this, I'm in the city. Will probally join the discord too.

Everyone is risk averse not just people who rat. All pvp players are risk adverse in taking fights they think they can win. And since the beginning? Let's go back to ASCN glory days a nullsec empire built around pve.
---
Your entire post is based around a reality that doesn't exist. What changes have been made to make pve safer? The only one has been rorqual panic.
---
You don't get to be the judge of how people should play the game just like I don't get to tell you your play style is wrong.

You are welcome Oprah but luckily I don’t feel a burden.

I’m sorry that one anonymous person on the internet who doesn’t agree with your perspective causes such earth shattering upset for you. It must be rough to be so intellectually insecure.

I'm guessing they spawned based on structure/player density under the logic that they'd be able to protect them with more players or something.

Yes, yes it is. I'm wondering what his HK Tengu is meant to kill if miners aren't the right target.
---
regardless of where u stand on this blackout thing. the reality is the majority of players are carebears. the game doesn't live off some 3 dork nano gang and their buds. it lives off the goon with 30 hulks and all the hisec dwellers who never left empire space. it's sad but it's true. if the bears actually decided to rage unsub ccp would call this shit off instantly and never speak of it again.

He *didn't* attack the miners with his Tengu, saying they're not the right target for it. I'm wondering what could possibly be the right target if not defenseless miners. I'm not crying about people killing miners. I'm wondering why he didn't.

Maybe that's an attractive option.

---
Came here only for this comment chain. Didnt disaapoint. Whoop whoop!
---
Nope because the most sense systems weren't picked. They didn't hit any capital systems of the alliances but they did hit frats staging keepstar. People checked every stat and didn't find any correlation.
---
It's total like 700k SP? Although 1/3 comes on day one I suppose. That's like a couple injectors at least.
---
So sorry that I don't accept your anecdotal evidence as fact. Do you always get mad when people ask for more than just an ambiguous reference to some obscure thread from years ago that may or may not exist? You can't even say what csm member it was, what dev, what forum etc yet somehow everyone is supposed to magically find it.

But hey whatever it's much easier to defend your point with attacks than to provide some sort of actual proof.

Not exactly :)

I have dual armor rep pvp fit astero for exploration works pretty well for hacking and fighting..
---
Given the fact that they can't verify 100% if somebody bots or not, it can hardly be in the responsibility of alliance leadership etc, not even talking about the time consumption.
---
A game company demanding their consumers to observe other consumers and then act against them is a strong intersting approach.... (talking actually kicking them etc. not just reporting, everybody should report a potential bot and there is hardly a lot of time wasted by doing so)
---
I higly appreciate those alliances that do take their time and actually do find and kick bots, but demanding it seems, well unrealistic at best.
---
my opinion.
---
regards.
---
ps. do we have a link or something where ccp stated something like alliances need to take actions?
---
Are you high?

Bombers get 3 BS sized launchers, not a full rack of 7 or 8.  The comparable drone flight would be 2 heavies on a VNI, which is what they're going to.

Yeah, that's just stupid.  Drive up log in numbers? Definitely.  Give back to players? Maybe.  While I am that jaded, I'm not that bitter to deny that possibility.

A lot of people are assuming that player numbers is the only thing that will drive the CCP decision making process. I doubt that is the case.
---
Go Eve University to start they are a neutral Corp with no alliances with others, they don't engage in Sov Warfare and they hold no Null Sec Sov Space. This means when you come to move on to a new corp you will not be barred because you are coming from the wrong side of a Sov war alliance.

And the free 3 months of MTC yesterday.

They didn't hit any test keepstar at all.

Good point, and one I didn't think of.

Hey its the dude.

Very well I'm going to work with that
---
100% agree. The fitting skills are what really push the last few percent.
---
It's not clear on the charts of isk/hr is per account or total.
---
That's debatable and probably a good topic. If we were to agree that should be the case, I would think the effort required to do so should be commensurate. But we're at a point where that effort level is *literally* just paying attention, and aligning to something new if you start getting out of range from targets. And somehow this is apparently still a bridge too far for people?
---
Oh, I remember exactly how long of a train it is. The problem was is that it was basically a must have for any drone ship, and put out a decent bit of extra damage for even a ship with unbonused drones.

Correct once they chose a system they kept spawning for a week and hit any structure. The issue is with what systems they chose, because either they got insanely lucky with rng or they were specifically chosen.
---
So what happens to the slaves I already have. Will they become shield forcing me to buy new armor set or will they just name change?
---
I get it. I’m just saying the issue probably arose because they informed your account about it and you didn’t do anything until you could.
---
okay /u/bbtb2 ur semi-cool again
---
You didn't say your accidently unsubbed.  You said you unsubbed, and made it quite clear with commentary that you want us to believe it was intentional and permanent. 
---
Nice try though.  r/EVE, the land of backpeddling bullshitters.  lol
---
Being aligned is not the perfect solution you think it is, mate. For one thing, you can only "be aligned" *after* you land on a site and finish aligning somewhere. Carriers and even battleship ratters take a while to get between sites and finally get to that aligned state. - If a hunter has any skill and patience whatsoever, they can catch you as you land and can't immediately warp off again.
---
It's also quite tricky to manage in certain situations as you sometimes need to keep withing range of things.
---
I hope he did cause that means he actually used it at least ( even if it was just moving it.)
---
&gt;It's clearly not disrupting things enough so that what "always happens" is still happening.
---
that was my point - it doesn't interrupt the alliance, it interrupts individual players.
---
Almost like... People are constantly guessing and making predictions. Who'd have thought!
---
How is it more capable? The range of hams is so bad even with faction that you would constantly be out burning your own missiles. Unless you are ramming with a 100mn legion then what’s the point. And there is a way better pulse 100mn fit that projects out to like 55km with scorch and tracks great. HAMs are honestly a shit platform.
---
Lmao. Right.
---
&gt; if you die at PVP you lost everything like Path Of Exile HC ?
---
Your money (isk) will still be yours, your trained skills will remain intact (except for in a very small amount of exceptional ships) and all assets you have in a station (bases all over the place) will remain there. But you will lose the ship you were flying in and everything on it.
---
So basically you have inventories all over the place, and only lose the one on your ship.
---
Does that mean Invasions or it count Abyss too
---
It was intentional. You can’t unsubscribe by accident. If the blackout is permanent then sure it’s permanent. 
---
Why is that so personally offensive to you that I would unsubscribe because I disagreed with a change?
---
&gt; He didn’t have to respond at all.
---
The irony here.
---
You didn't have to respond at all, either.  But you did.  In an open forum.  And now you're whining about the responses you received. lol
---
You are, presumably and giving you some serious benefit of the doubt here, and adult.

It's time you learn that if you voice your opinion in public, someone can and probably will shit all over it.
---
&gt; Do you have anything constructive to add
---
Constructive to you?  Hardly.  
---
&gt; is pithy sarcasm the best you can manage?
---
No, but it's all that I find you are worth.
---
There is something weird in the way you spelled "Loki".
---
No worries friend.
---
What do you mean we? You can speculate that something will happen without relying on other people to tell you how you think.
---
That hair is glorious nicely done sender
---
To an extent yes, and in certain countries more than others. I feel that physical modification is on a different level however, and will exacerbate this further.
---
&gt;  while focusing on the actual gun/missile skills that will blanket affect all of your ship selections
---
Adding to this, getting all your core gunnery skills to V with the exception of Surgical Strike V and Trajectory Analysis V is a total of 2 652 474 SP. In EVE terms that's not much for a grouping of skills that will affect the vast majority of combat ships.
---
&gt; I never understood why gankers used catalysts over thrashers
---
On the off-chance that you're serious with this one, it's dps.
---
Well sure, it might be kind of sucky from CCP's side to target Goons more than others, but if you look at it from a lore standpoint, it kind of makes sense. The drifters are for some reason invading. They would probably have a plan and have been around for a while, scanning everything, so they should have some pretty good intel at this point. They would notice that Goons are the strongest alliance and a big threat, therefore focusing on them.
---
Not like CCP has been doing this kind of shitty events for quite some time or anything, right?
---
And yes, I clearly think they are trying to cheat numbers, but I think it has more to do with a general plan to keep numbers "up" than with this specific situation (after all, who didn't say on the survey that SP was the best reward during the anniversary login event?).
---
- criticizing code
---
- progressive CODEr
---
:thinking:
---
He actually explained it pretty well above. Just because someone doesn't play EVE the way you do doesn't mean his fun is worth less than yours. If he enjoys mining then that's his prerogative, why are you so salty for him play the game different? He doesn't like PVP, he doesn't have to! There are many ships in the game that are not combat-related.
---
EVE was made to be a sandbox and for people to play the game however they wanted to.
---
You're gonna have to wear that wig in the next EVE Pulse...
---
I am only allowed 1 sensible post a week. Lmao.
---
That's fair, you can only align after landing. For battleships I don't think it's as big an issue, carriers more so. But the way you'd have to get them is land in a site before them which means you either are lucky, or know what site they'll be at and punt a sabre at it or logoff trap. Outside of the use of spy toons it's pretty hard to guess those things, they aren't about having patience and skill on the hunters side. You'd have to arrive in local after they initiate warp (which you don't know when that is) and then be ready once they land and get them before warping off. So while you are right, that definitely hcan happen, it's almost always more luck or ratter stupidity than "skill and patience"
---
....I know I don’t have to respond. 
---
I understand you are clearly upset about something. Take a deep breath and articulate your view instead of going totally mental and I’ll be happy to chat to you about anything you want to chat about.

The RLML drone legion is pretty good Loki alternative. Especially with bling.
---
&gt; Not like CCP has been doing this kind of shitty events for quite some time or anything, right?
---
last time they felt like they had put a *little bit* more effort in. even if some of the stuff i'd probably never use like the facial augs etc it was a bit nicer and felt a bit more considered than "throw SP at the problem until it goes away".
---
So... little supposition here but... 
---
If players hold out for plex sales to buy plex.... does that mean players will only login for SP events?  
---
Not gonna login at all if there’s no bonus SP?
---
I feel like that logic is sound... does this mean we should really start to expect more frequent SP events (like monthly to keep the subs subbed?)?????
---
But it's rather convenient, if it's a general goal to keep sub numbers up as you think it is, that they would announce this event a few days after it was reported that login numbers were down to a record low thanks to the blackout.
---
&gt; zero interest of listening to player input through protest.
---
How do you know that "protest" of people not logging in isn't mostly botters playing it safe?
---
Preach it!
---
i have a piece of steve or two.
---
Meanwhile, deltas in tribute are at an all-time high!
---
Well according to everyone here, null was full with "24/7 botters" up until the blackout. Can't be logged in longer than that, so that metric is sure to drop anyway.
---
It's still in the EULA.

No one cares you don’t play the game.  Fuck right off

Yeah but I thought in high sec you get a only a few seconds before concord jams you out? I have never done hi sec ganking myself, but wouldn't a high alpha on a thrasher be the better bet for destroying the target in time?
---
2FA would have prevented this. I also don't believe you when you claim you weren't sharing.
---
and the ability to have a level of control over entrances/exits to your system.

I am right. Loki is king. I kept my blops for bridge purpose only.
---
i have lost a pair of titans actually, one driveby'ing bait and one in ualx
---
i'm not in the all time top lists of supercap usage or anything but i use mine more than most and rarely with an umbrella so
---
Dont feel bad for the krabs they're all useless anyway
---
&gt; Hope you never lost a Super or Titan travelling southeast lowsec regions, than you might have met me already ... there were some bigmouth PL and NC. dudes that just died because the move op was gone and they were shit
---
/u/rocket_x c/d?
---
Yeah it's brawling 100mn obviously. It's more capable at taking actual fights than rlml because your sustained dps is better. You aren't killing many half-decent pvp brawling cruisers in 1 clip of rlml.
---
And a CSM member was milking off of this. No wonder we haven't seen a ping asking to donate for a new pc.
---
Buying your rorquals for insulting levels of isk then sell them right back to you once they become FoTM again.

---
Can I have your stuff
---
&gt; but taking a look at the classic old roaming routes that died about 3-4 years ago, there is much more life in much more systems now than before
---
So much feelycraft. Do you have actual numbers?
---
Second only to "should I play this game" posts in annoyance factor
---
Except those PVPers are usually the same players with the rorquals and the ratting supers.
---
The people who love this no local thing are, as I understand it, mainly people quite used to losing several ships a day hunting glorious killmails.
---
Maybe you should look into selling your old account for isk and buying one more in line with the activities you want to do
---
It's almost as if this blackout is a cover up. To think someone could be in system gives a bit of mysteriousness, but in actuality nothing has changed. Null is just as dead as it was before (in some parts anyway), you just don't see it as clearly.
---
You should look for a corp/alliance that is active in the timezone that you are active in. Depending on what you wanna do in game, between pvp/industry/mining, you will have several options I'm sure. Obviously with the larger blocs, you will have more players active at more times, creating a possibility for more "content". Any  groups worth your time will have at least some degree of in house organization for regular fleets.
---
Eve is all about isk vs reward
---
Numbers are down according to publicly available information so these events are timed to try and keep the numbers from falling further. Its a shame a proper redesign of Null and low sec with a more of a lead in time would have probably satisfied both PVP and PVE aspects of the game and could have brought more players back to eve to counter those who have left.
---
So, when people log in for 20 secs to claim these, does it artificially inflate the login numbers so CCP can pretend that local blackout is more popular than it is?
---
Pog is this real??
---
Or it's meant to counter act the yearly drop in player numbers across july and august?
---
I saw this same ping from razor.
---
I’ve also noticed that a LOT of razor are bitching about blackout lmao
---
Longer login time doesn’t matter to Korea, only sub numbers do. And plex purchases

Day 1 Omega reward, 275,000 SP.

---
I forget, what was that for?
---
so this is what i wrote to a non eve friend of mine about one high sec war we had
---
so in eve i live in unnamed region with my friends of many years. they mine, produce industrial stuff and sometimes shoot at enemies. anyway some guys tried to mine on moons we have our mining structures at, so my friends destroyed them few times. then they came and declared war on us. they attacked 3 of our structures and managed to get the last one which was not yet fit to defend itself, to lower it from shield and armor timer to final structure one. they were in total half of our number, cca 17 with 3-4 scouts and possibly just 5-7 people using multiple accounts, so they would be slow to react.
---
anyway we sit in the about to go pop station in 13 energy sucking battleships plus boosts and repair ships, and other ships (30 together, plus 4 on way) and they warp onto our nearly destroyed structure (they have 4 energy sucking ships too), deploy drones and start bashing structure. after a minute our suicide battleship warps in and starts smartbombing their fleet and mainly destroying their drones that were 30-40% of their damage making. once the smartbombing is over, all 13 energy sucking battleships undock, and then we just see them warp away and run.
---
they thought they had us, they never fought us, just saw twice the numbers but thought we do nothing but mine. once they saw the smartbombing suicide ship and then energy sucking ships undocking they knew to run. we had a scout shadow them to a far away system and they went through so it ment they left for good that evening.
---
ADDON: week later we have our usual weekly content bash of a dead stick, and we get info that one of those guys is undocking with a bowhead (ship to carry ships) the moment our 17 man fleet has returned from another system. a scout near the npc station just laughed on teamspeak that the moment we jumped into local, the guy stopped aligning and immediately docked. i had to leave because it was after midnight for me an euro, but others were having fun and trying to trap the guy. in the end it did not happen, but hey fun is fun.
---
Sounds like a real Blackout to me to be honest.
---
How did removing local remove the danger of being counter attacked? Assuming the ratter isnt afk he can call for backup.
---
The corps that concentrate their efforts and actually engage in teamwork will persevere via gatecamps, comms, intel. Losing the bots is the cherry on top.
---
Very true that.  
---
I just think that it’s not in the long term best interest of the game to dilute down SP too much.  That said, I really think that ship had sailed a long time ago, and it will not be long till we can just outright buy SPs from CCP and remove the ‘extra steps’ of buying an injector from the market.
---
grr gons hat gons, gons bad
---
b-b-b-but muh pro blackout posts were getting so many updoots on reddit!!! there were even screenshots of people resubbing!! like 2!! how can this be a flop???
---
dude, this is not local jita
---
Why not both?
---
Awesome man, really made us chuckle in the office haha
---
Made my day bud, hope you have a good one! &lt;3

Not giving in game asset or contract...
---
As someone who participated in the first round, I doubt I would do the 2nd unless I got some reward because the first round was so bad. While the servers didn't crash the first time, it was unplayable due to lag. Missiles wouldn't hit anything, and you would see hundreds if not thousands of them just randomly change direction for no reason. I hope the tech could be used to make better Eve nodes, but I feel like the current server design with TIDI actually still allows the game to be played, even if it does take 30 minutes for an action to happen.
---
&gt; How is this Game Compare to another MMORPG ?
---
Cold and unforgiving, like the depths of space we call home.
---
The secret of Eve is that it wasn't actually designed by CCP, they're just the guards. It's actually a honey trap sponsored by all of the other MMOs to keep the worst of the worst segregated away from their communities. You will never find a more vile den of scum and villainy than in Eve Online.
---
"Shocker"
---
Now I understand why you guys don't like to undock.
---

---
This is CCP needing to report good login metrics to Korea
---
Wait, how are you posting this from Moon if blackout is in effect??
---
Even if there is a lore reason it's a pretty shitty thing to do. It created a ton of work for a group of players with no reward or way to stop it
---
Cost neutral?
---
The issue is that all you have to do is fit a Micro Jump Srive to your ship... New sig or ship appears on scan and you align away from the sleepers and hit the MJD and you're away. That's literally it...
---
One module is an instant win in sites. And it takes 10 seconds. 
---
Right click; align to safe spot or citadel or POS. Hit MJD wait for spool. Warp away.
---
I would argue that they should not be able to be lit within 1 AU of a celestial at all.
---
Gotta light it and drop caps in the middle of nowhere.
---
(If we're in agreement and I just can't read then I'm a dumbo with candy for brains)
---
Apologies for not knowing a single individual person by name when I'm regularly monitoring around two dozen discussion platforms relating to EVE on pretty much an hourly basis, on top of all the gaming channels and platforms I'm also watching out of personal interest.
---
Clearly I'm bad at life, lol.
---
They are too busy working in ways to attract new subscriptions to worry about your sorry ass.
---
Pretty much. A MJD fitted is an instant "get out of site for free the second anything comes on scan or if a new sig pops" ...
---
He is implying people not only want local but also want ccp to make uninterrupted risk free pve. I am saying that is as stupid as saying pvpers only want killmails delivered to their front door. They are both hyperbole except some people actually believe people are asking for what he is saying.
---
I still feel that "Would have lived if it was a shield super" will always be a meme, even if they do come out with shield slaves.
---

Not really sure what you want me to say, they specifically said that people wouldn't be banned for that not that long ago.
---
T3...mmhrmm
---
Standard coward fit is a cloaked nullified artillery Loki. Hide, hit anything that can't hit you back from as far away as you can. If you are targeted or approached warp away. A fair pilot in an assault frigate will wreck you.
---
Otherwise get a gang or prepare to feed t3cs.
---
Wait aren't you a snuff pet?
---
I don't understand this no danger bullshit. Most groups worth hunting have large standing fleets full of supers, gate camps throughout their space, and extensive intel networks. What part of that says "no danger of being attacked" to you?
---
Put another way, why do nullsec krab idiots think that unless PvPers fly directly at the 30 supers you drop to save your rorqual and let you kill them that they're just risk averse?
---
I was using hyperbole to show how stupid his sentence is, except people seem to think that's what people who want local back actually want.
---
Actually, the SP events (SP login week, SP login weekend, NPC SP skilling spree) were introduced on SiSi (as evidenced by Hoboleaks) long before the blackdown was even a thing, before 0.0 Drifters were a thing either, iirc.
---
You can take your tinfoil hat off now. :P

Any mention of a gate to stain...

I know right you can have the ISK for a dread in seconds
---
Why would they do that if it was just the seasonal classic tendency ?
---
Fact is, since the blackout we can see in EVE-Offline that there is between 10 and 15 % less logged at a time compared to the summer of 2018. While it was possible to have 28-32 K, now we hardly have 26-29 K.
---
But... I expected more logoffs to be honest. The blackout is far from being a disaster. At least for now, maybe the real consequences will happen in the next weeks.
---
Isn’t having the “From” address in that picture technically considered doxxing?
---
It's not now, not has it been since like 2009 or something...  Why does everyone always say this?
---
Every alliance you say?
---
&gt; Oh, and if you want to talk about login numbers, let's talk about the 20,000 a day logins we've lost to the uninteresting sov nullsec meta
---
I heard it was more like 100,000
---
Maybe even 200,000
---
Hello. Fairly new player here. Should I make alts rom different races or should I just keep them one race? I still dont know why I would use them but I would like to start training them sooner rather then later. Was thinking about training magic 14 skills on all of them for starters. 
---
Thanks for help
---
It's hyperbole just like his original post. Except people seem to think anyone opposed to this change actually wants risk free pve so I reversed it. Turns out the reverse sounds just as stupid as what people are projecting onto the anti local group
---
Cloaks online, it's fun.
---
What a horrible Ishtar fit, you did it a favour.
---
Role playing with a nude Night elf in goldshire
---
My faith in tier 3 rust has finally been rewarded after years of having those filthy caldari and Gallente make fun of me.
---
Same tbh.
---
&gt; Btw: most people tell me, that higher isk/plex ratios cause more players to spend $ for convenience. This is disproven for a long time: The plex prices are 10+ times higher than years ago, still there are people earning the isk by boring stuff instead of just buying plex... 1 plex buys me a month of decent pvp ships.
---
Disproven? Where is the actual prove then? I mean, where do you think does all the PLEX on the market come from? Out of thin air? Who bought it and why if not for convenience?
---
Also, PLEX costs around 6 times as much than 10 years ago, this is further being reduced by the fact that Tritanium costs twice as much as back then as well, which indicates an inflation factor of 2. This results in PLEX being worth only about 3 times as much as back then so you're overexaggerating just a little.
---
Is CCP losing money from RMT sales? If somebody buys PLEX for $20 and sells it to a botter for ISK, who then sells me that same PLEX for $10 resulting in consumption of said PLEX, CCP still made $20 from that transaction. You know what's really a misconception? That anybody would by automatically buy the PLEX from CCP instead if there is no other option available. The original buyer might also not even buy that PLEX in the first place without a botter offering them big ISK. In this case CCP made $0 if the consumer decides to not pay $20 either.
---
Your types of PLEX interactions which concern CCP can be reduced to two points.
---
1. PLEX being bought from CCP.
---
2. PLEX being consumed/redeemed for CCP Services, destroying the PLEX in the process.
---
The only relevant incentive to buy PLEX from CCP, other than redeeming them for ourselves, is to sell it for ISK on the market or using it as currency in which case the motivation is exactly the same. Everything which reinforces this motive is beneficial for CCP. PLEX being worth three times as much probably works pretty well in this regard.
---
Now to the consumption of PLEX: We'll skip everybody who's consuming their own PLEX as they're not really relevant to the discussion. Currently, people who like playing Omegas for free are requiring three times the effort for that than 10 years ago. This is without a doubt influenced by botting and RMT and sucks for everybody involved. Where you could've played with Omega 6 accounts in the earlier times, it's now down to 2. People are consuming less PLEX on average because acquiring them with ISK takes more time.
---
How well do these two factors play against each other though? Here's a fact: **We don't know.** We can't know because there is no statistical data on that. Reduced PLEX consumption should lower the price of it as more and more PLEX floods the market, which in turn would make them available again for less effort however. 
---
If CCP would release statistics about the percentage of free Omega players vs players would paid for them or actual PLEX sales and consumption, then we could start drawing conclusions but we, apparently, don't have these statistics available. In this case common sense tells me to disregard claims made by people who can't bring up actual evidence of them.
---
If you want to carrier rat, I highly recommend you Join one of the 4 (3) big boys on the block, get a super, fit a cyno and put a full shield and armor tank refit in your fleet bay, split your ozone stack to prevent serious injury or death, get on comms and in standing fleet, be sure you are in jump range, and start making 100+ mil per mind numbing tick in worryfree safety.
---
Otherwise, get ganked without seeing anything coming.
---
Fair enough  Half of that i'd hazard a guess are bots not logging in.
---
&gt;  one with a spy in every alliance
---
No less then 11 black legion spies
---
&gt; that was my point - it doesn't interrupt the alliance, it interrupts individual players.
---
That wasn't your INITIAL point - it was that all alliances are the same, and are taking the blackout the same way, which was poorly and you said that was impacting players, poorly.
---
My first comment to you was how this is a PLAYER problem, not an alliance/corp issues, and if players aren't happy with their alliance/corp to MOVE.  You gave me that stupid-ass "work" analogy to try to say they couldn't, because all "work" is the same everywhere.  Now you are telling me what I've been trying to hammer into the solid fucking granite skull of yours:  IT'S A PLAYER PROBLEM. :D
---

---
Yes, around 400mil but not all of it paid upfront. Targets to be met over the next 'x' years in order to get the full amount.
---
or it's to get people to log in and actually try it instead of knee jerk unsubbing
---
10 percent drop now that bots don't work and therefore aren't logged in is pretty good
---
Seriously, as a "new" (late 2016) player I really don't understand who those guys are talking to. 
---
Oh sweet you were the CEO of a industrial focused nomadic band of pirates based out of dodixie in 2008, your opinion is tOtAlLy relevant and reflective of my experience.

I will still take your memes and stuff though!
---
Not my kill.  Just a random I found ZK.
---
Why can I not wish some of the bigger alliances would do a better job of teaching their pilots the game?   
---
If more newbs get better the game gets better.
---
&gt; Except people seem to think anyone opposed to this change actually wants risk free pve so I reversed it.
---
No. People opposed to the blackout are used to having huge advantages and don't want any changes to their style of gameplay, at the same time as they tell PvPers to adapt or die. You're building up a strawman and screeching at it.
---
True. It also stops any normal person in a sub cap from trying to rat too, because right now covert cynos are way broken. 
---
You never know when 100 bombers are going to materialize in your system, they do not show up on d-scan, and even with umbrellas anything smaller than a capital is just dying in a fire.
---
Their name will be changed so itll still be an armor set.
---
Haven't we been clearly informed in the past that the marketing team and the balancing teams don't coordinate like this?
---
&gt; That wasn't your INITIAL point
---
yes it was.
---
Skillpoints already are sold for cash in unlimited amounts, there's just a PLEX step in between.  The SP and PLEX markets are essentially bottomless for any realistic personal needs.  That distinction was always a mealy-mouthed lie from CCP.
---
If you're AFK you aren't looking at local anyway.. Do it in a quiet system where someone would have to travel a long way to find you and you can still be okay.
---
&gt; I pulled the trigger on incorrect information and since I’m waiting out the test anyway there was no point to correct it.
---
So, in other words, you did something you wouldn't have done otherwise without that information.
---
Like an accident? :D
---
&gt; Why is that so personally offensive to you that I would unsubscribe because I disagreed with a change?
---
This is the second time you've tried to gaslight someone into their own feelings.  Other dude isn't hostile and i'm not offended.  I'm fucking amused. :D
---
I find your actions hilarious.  You were so upset and panicked at the IDEA of a change, that you quickly (and without properly researching it) canceled multiple year-long subs.   
---
That's some fucking carebear dedication.  Or you're a botter.  One of those always gets my ridicule.  The other, my scorn.
---
So, either way, I'mma give you some shit, my dude.
---
Yeah just rat in ishtar/myrm/domi, which is annoying because those take a year or two longer to solo in a retri. I can't even kill the fuckin domi.

This is very true. I still think this combined with how dirt cheap and super easy to maintain citadels are and their enorm power + tether is why the entire blackop comunity that used to be is gone.

&gt; Especially our Korean overlords winky face
---
Imagine complaining about free SP
---
&gt; when does the rest of eve tell the mittens to eat their ass and drop in to glass deleve
---
Probably never with current game mechanics. It's not impossible per say, but extremely unlikely given the number of keepstars in Delve and the number of supers the Imperium can field. 
---
Anyone attempting to glass Delve is most likely going to give up after the first week. Plus, what's the point? It's not like glassing Delve will make goons go away anymore than evicting us from Deklein made us go away. If you got every other major coalition to unite to evict goons from Delve, and they somehow succeeded, in a few months after everyone has gone home, we'd be right back in Delve.

If I had a dollar for every brain you didn't have, I'd have one dollar.

No it wasn’t an accident i quite deliberately cancelled them. I was acting on wrong information. I wouldn’t have done it otherwise. I’m not sure it’s an accident though. I knew what I was doing. I’ve not undone it even though I could. 
---
My man the blackout isn’t the idea of a change. It’s happened. 
---
I get it. You don’t like PvE players. I think that’s a bit of a childish attitude that because I choose to play a game differently to you that you need to abuse me personally but that’s up to you.
---
accurate
---
It's because you're in tapi. You aren't the first, move along.

haha that makes me feel better that you guys were entertained, apologies in advance if everyone else and their mother feel it necessary to send you guys shit! Just wanted to get spicy with the CCP Spice Master since you been sending people to the burn unit lately :D

Jin'taan's vids have been really good lately, i really liked the one he did with ashterothi (also another guy that produces some fantastic content) on the drifer backstory - a part of the lore i loved when it came out, got disappointed at it's near abandonment and have been excited about since the piss poor drifter 'invasion' nonsense brought them back to the forefront.

Well I deleted the ticket part in case anyone in CCP took it the wrong way. Didn't know it wasn't allowed.
---
They also drop from npc's, atm just talismans which are dirt cheap.
---
&gt; Upon investigating your request regarding account we have found that the account security has been willfully compromised as a result of account sharing or attempted account transfer between multiple parties.
---
The friend you were sharing your account with took your stuff? Imagine RMTing your isk and trying to get reimbursed so you can RMT it again.
---
yeah like that
---
Yeah, and just as it's his right to play how he wants, it's my right to voice my opinion in response to his actions he publicly posted on EVE.
---
I find the fact that he unsubbed multiple year-long accounts at the first news of the Blackout, before he even did enough research to find out if it was temporary or not.
---
That level of chickenshittery is hilarious to me.  If it comes with a little salt, well, I'm kind of an asshole, and I'm fairly salted already.
---
Is it because he doesn’t feel safe? Nullsec shouldn’t feel safe at all.
---
They will either be turned into new slaves or be unplugged and in cargo as shield ones.
---
I'd say those are probably more annoying than anything else by a wide margin...
---
&gt;For each account you cancel, three rough riding PVPers will take their place.
---
No, they won't. Champion the blackout if you must, but cute this naive crap.
---
Honestly, it's a grey area it seems. But it is in the TOS. Just don't give them an excuse to use it against you. Even if other people have said it's fine, it's not worth the risl of you are telling the truth and you've done bugger all wrong.
---
No one has yet shown you any proof that you can share GM mails. So until then, I just wouldn't advise it until you see someone from CCP tell you otherwise.
---
So why exactly are they renaming the armor slaves "amulets" and then naming the new shield implants "slaves?" 
---
Doesn't it seem easier from the point of view of player familiarity after a decade of calling an implant set 'slaves' to just use the new name--amulet--for the new shield implants? 
---
CCP, your decision making ~~somtimes~~ always puzzles me.
---
The ones that use dscan. See, this is funny - I have heard over and over again that killing local wouldn't have an impact on bots and now you're arguing that it will. 
---
Which is it?
---
For a reference I am about 3.5 weeks in with +1 implants and just broke one mill so on a new toon with no RL$. Seems like going Omega now would be a waste of cash until I get all my alpha skills trained. I would like to spend my 1 plex on mods/sp/boosters though. This sounds like a good stepping stone.
---
Lmao the ones where they're hovering their mouse over the 2860 Plex package made me laugh.

&gt; Because with blackout seeing them coming becomes more difficult virtually removing the option to warp out.
---
No, see my earlier comment.

so? less isn´t zero. it´s still low effort and always available. why would you expect great payouts?
---
&gt; Nothing about the afkness of the activity changes. Drone auto aggro hasn't been touched.
---
Your ship gets touched when you´re afk or don´t pay attention. If you´re not afk getting killed isn´t an issue if you know what you´re doing. If you don`t: Why are you in null?
---
Sowy
---
There seem to be less heavy armor brawls lately.
---
The funniest thing about the blackout is that WH groups are running into each other hunting in nullsec, so there have been a lot of three and four-party shenanigans going on.
---
This fight in particular was some insane happenstance where 4 groups are all connected and have the people online to mess around. 
---
The other day we had HAWKS connected to us. They rolled our static and the new static was HK’s home, which was dramatic. There are all sorts of zany connections happening often, but that’s pretty normal!
---
Mining is indifferent to botting so yes
---
It is okay game.
---
Ah good. Must've missed that. Good, though - was spooked for a moment
---
&gt;Introduce more scrams in ~~sleeper sites~~ all combat sites
---
Wormholer btw
---
"what the fuck CCP I wouldn't have unsubbed my VNI bots if I knew about the free SP fuck this game"
---
dude if u want to carebear in peace without beeing disturbed go to hisec...nullsec isnt a place for botters and afk carebears
---
In general, yeah I like this. Tbh it would make Eve a hell of a lot more dangerous. I'm all for that. Seems pointless sites only long pointing. Have some that scram and some that point.
---
&gt; ....I know I don’t have to respond.
---
And yet you do.  I'm bored at work, being paid to be an ass right now.  What's your excuse?  Masochism? 
---
And here we see some more classic examples of gaslighting:
---
&gt; I understand you are clearly upset about something.
---
&gt; I sense that actually you just want to have a written tantrum and that’s also fine.
---
Mocking someone for a completely over-the-top, un-researched action ! = written tantrum.  But that's cool.  Call it what you want, I'm laughing at you all the same. :D
---
&gt; Have a good evening brother and I hope you cheer up tomorrow.
---
I already let you know I was having a great day, but thanks still!
---
Never dealt in RMT and never will. I wasn't playing the game when all this went down so don't you think it'd make more sense for me to report this immediately after I got hacked instead of 8 months later?
---
How many times have you run your fingers through it and do a dramatic hair flip?
---
I really like [Lasker Emanual](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5F3RCReOweuoBYQlV3OIPQ) videos. They are mainly solo pvp videos, just very calm watching them.
---
Domi requires a decent gang to kill, especially if fit with lots of neuts and MJD.
---
I'm currently training into T3D's and I'm dying to try one out in the blackout region
---
Fuck, I'll take it.
---
If you dont care about the rules and spend some time to circumvent them, yes. Otherwise you can't multibox alphas.
---
when you broke from smoking too much ya everything is expensive lol
---
Submitted another ticket telling them that it wasn't just my eve account that got hacked at the time but also my steam. Maybe that's why they think I was doing account sharing? Idk :/
---
No battleship uses only drones for dps while being focused on damage. Even a drone dominix is mostly good for the neuting power in pvp, not the dps.
---
playing ,i like to listen to carebear screams in local...omnomnomnom
---
The missiles changing directions were the ones that had hit their target but didn’t despawn/you fired at a target that was already dead. I got like 30+ kills pretty easily. 
---
Your reward is the potentially amazing tech getting invested in and used for EVE and other MMO games. 
---
This is alpha level stuff, not a finished product. They need us to prove that this has potential.
---
&gt; why would you expect great payouts?
---
because i assume ccp want people to actually be out in null doing stuff.
---
ur low effort meme doesn't tho
---
It's total with the minimum number of characters listed. It's a little tough to quantify because it really depends on how much of your "setup" time you count (rolling holes, making bookmarks), how many characters you have, their skills, how efficient you are, etc... But it's something in the realm of   
---
Nestors in static - 200-250mil per nestor per hour
---
Nestors + astra or dread for drifter blapping - 400-500 mil per nestor per hour
---
Dreads in a C6 - 1 bil per dread per hour
---
But again, take those with a grain of salt because it could be better or worse depending on the factors listed above. I think her chart is a good set of ballpark numbers
---
botting happens where ever you can make isk.
---
Wait what
---
I am quite sure that the Blackout has been discussed at length in CCP its not like the Devs walked in one day and over coffee someone said "hey I know lets drop a blackout on Null that would be baller" and everyone else was like "cool" and so it happened. Its all part of the development cycle the SP events were put in place to either help the new/returning players get up to speed for the blackout or as a safety net to try and halt the slide if it went poorly. The jury is still out on how the blackout will panout.
---
It’s a really common model so it’s probably associated with increased play as well. 
---
If you’re not logging into a game often, you might be less worried or interested in logging in at all. 
---
But logging in at all, even if you only plan to collect a reward and leave, keeps the game fresh in your mind and might encourage you to play more.
---
Great! PVE is a little dry, tbh, but PVP is awesome. You don't lose everything, just your ship. You're gonna have a lot of ships - they're more like ammunition than an avatar.
---
Game's hard to learn but very worth it. :)
---
&gt; The ones that use dscan. 
---
yeah uh how is a bot going to dscan whitelist other VNIs, Gilas, or Ishtars? Those ships CAN be used for PvP ya know...
---
Oh yeah, PVP fit domi is a bitch. Last bait domi found out the hard way tho that you can rip it down with 4-5 hecates, jesus those guys do a lot of damage.
---
CCP didn't show what they got from me.
---
isnt your stuff in asset safety?
---
Because they warp out whenever another ship lands on grid?  Come on, man.
---
delete this
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA why the fuck are you wasting our time with this bullshit. stay in highsec pleb.
---
Very definitely. They're was a post in here a week or two ago from a new guy who ran into a 40+ botting operation complete with security guards and hauling. But because of hisec combat mechanics there isn't much you can do about them before CONCORD arrives.
---
Lmao true story. Even if they are on another account tabbed over. F HIM HES A BOT!
---
Nice reference. GET SOME.
---
there are other things to do in eve?
---
No?
---
100mn Gilas, VNIs, and Ishtars align longer than it takes for me to land a point on them.
---
Yeah no, the game's doing pretty well, the extra SP is honestly a good incentive with all the returning vets and newbros hitting the game for the big patch.
---
This one...while I don't like SP handouts, is probably an overall good idea.
---
races literally mean nothing anymore. sadly.
---
&gt;Different damage thresholds and damage caps for capitals and subcapitals, to reinforce the role of caps as siege assets against structures.  Maybe even different damage caps and thresholds between different structures. So for example,
---
So you literally envision all classes of capital ships, the most skill point intensive ships in the game, as having a structure bashing only role? Even back in 2006 and 2007 this wasn't the case. Yes, dreads shot POSes, but they also shot other capital ships, and carriers and supers could be used to great effect against sub caps. 
---
On top of that, structure bashing has always been the most boring part of the game (and less relevant with the removal of POSes), so basically you are saying that my literal *years* of training in two racial carriers, two racial dreads, and two racial Titans should all be converted into things balanced entirely around killing structures, and to some extent, other capitals (I say this because your proposed changes also make capitals more vulnerable to subcaps, so capitals would not necessarily be needed to kill other capital fleets)?
---
If this is the case, and the game were changed in this way, I am afraid I am going to have to insist that CCP refund *all* of my capital related skill points, so I can put them towards things that are actually fun to play in your new meta.
---
he just started showing up one day and they didn't have the heart, or balls, to tell him to stop.
---
pro tip, make a 4th account and have the 4th character on that account. you will pay the same but you will have the ability to have them all logged in at once. MCT is a waste of time.
---

I rule against you, as CCP did. Learn how to fraud
---
Memes or not, I see a todd post, I upvote ;-D
---
not nearly enough. do you self a favor. stop mining and pvp. you'll make more money.
---
Shop naming
---
No, it's not a microtransaction game, it's a subscription game with a "free to play" trial on top of it. While playing as an alpha clone is a thing, the game really opens up when you subscribe.
---
because spies. people seem to think this matters anymore. with skill injectors spies are impossible to find. ask test how many spies i have in test, they will tell you none.
---
If he doesnt notice you approaching for 20km, he’s a bot.
---
alpha is an inside joke. its ccp's way of trying to get new people to play the game. you are basically useless as an alpha.
---
Normal CCP metric manipulating for their agenda, they've done this repeatedly in the past.  You can make metrics show whatever you want with a little guidance, and they seem to know this well.
---
Every botter right now
---
the launcher is bugged beyond belief.
---
I like to listen to Joebane pwn noobs. It's like a lullaby
---
Somebody didn't get enough hugs recently. Geez.
---
Frankly, while I want newbros to join Dreddit so I can teach them to roll small gang nano shit, I'm aware that's not a big part of our alliance's newbie culture and have to agree with you. :(
---
There's room to do more than press F1 in the big alliances, it's just that most people don't, and the main "teaching stream" doesn't encourage newbros to actually play the game.
---
Plus if they DON'T join Dreddit I can shoot at them.
---
5 hecates will murder pretty much anything at 0, although I guess if the domi was able to lock up and neut out all of them it would survive, unless the hecates were cap booster fit
---
What if I told you that players have no choice but to play the game as it is?
---
From the wording there's no reason to think it won't count abyss.  If so, T1 abyssmals will be the new free bot haven.
---
Come back if you love their methods.
---
If the null groups would decide to fight each other instead of blue each other there would be no problems with conflicts and safety. 
---
These are player problems not ccp problems.  Not local chat problems.  Not anything other than player problems.
---
Perhaps, you got a dealer?
---
lmao
---
They HAVE to blue up half of the donut?
---
His sentence is facetious if you couldnt tell
---
Dude, don't let the Null-Bears trash your PVP. You saw an opportunity and you went for it. You got a kill. On goons no less. They will down vote this comment, but it doesn't matter. I for one give you props for trying. That is the first step to elite PVP.
---
Very well written guide. 
---
Jspace krabbing is great isk per character per hour with minimal skills and investment needed. Low SP character in a nestor can generally get near super-levels of isk per hour while putting minimal isk on field. The downside it that's it's more effort overall to get set up and running, but I think this guide boils it down to the basics quite well.
---
And that one chick that screeches louder than everyone.
---
You put in a leshak fit that requires a Nestor to be repping it, but not the dual c5 leshak
---
Lmao solution for organizing ships: don’t own ships
---
Eve: Online may use it if it is successful.
---
It amazes me that people (CCP included) still seems to think throwing free SP at people is going to solve the retention problems.  Its like they ignore all of the real issues that are causing logins and retention to keep going down, and then acting :surprisedpikachu: when throwing more free SP at everyone isn't fixing it.
---
I sadly don't have time to really get into it, but I honestly just don't feel like the fitting skills add anything of value to the game. They just expand the gap between veteran and newer players by deliberately creating an uneven playing field.
---
I feel that veterans have enough advantages with their experience, increased options, and (presumably) ready access to higher quality equipment. We don't really *need* a, "My Rifter is flat-out better than your Rifter until you also have spent months training these thoroughly unexciting skills" advantage on top of all of that as well.
---
I'm the Principle SAN Architect for one of the worlds largest retail companies.  I never get enough hugs, and I'm made of salt.  
---
Days done though, so I'll go home and the dogs will lick their asses, then my face, and all will be right with the world. :D
---
See ya!
---
crabs that dock up as soon as near2 goes off are not in space doing stuff or interacting with people anyways. so what exactly changes in game other that they stop inflating the economy?
---
I didn't say I wanted to pve in peace, I said don't be mad when we use overwhelming force to force you out of  our space. People say it's mean for us to not come fight on their terms but why should we?
---
Youre not wrong about it being an easy karma grab, but you are about test not being goons. 
---
Test have been goons since they got together in a circlejerk and blue'd all over each others face.
---
People use the game mechanics to benefit them the most. Expecting people to do something to disadvantage themself is irrational. So its the Job of CCP to change the Game Mechanics to not make it the optimal play.
---
Of course it does.  Just like one dude getting back to back faction titan spawns allowed CCP to parade around and say the metrics show 360M ticks.  These clowns are well known to abuse outlier metrics and twist them to the current agenda.
---
If he never locks you up but keeps ratting while dying, he's a bot.
---
Is there some game mechanic that prevents players making their own alliances and coalitions I dont know about? Is there some *cheating* going on? 
---
I'm not trying to convince you because grrgoons but I will answer my own question: no, no one is cheating by making friends with people. You issue is with gamenlimitations or lack thereof. Sorry bubba.
---
Wouldn’t players use whatever mechanics available to maintain their status quo
---
&gt; azing community in on
---
I did work on the development side, and I have to say that my life improved greatly when I quit working in the industry and went back to grad school. 
---
Part of that was I no longer had to work 16 hour days, with no days off, for months on end, but a larger part I think was that I could return to enjoying video games, and to some extent, participating in game communities without constantly wanting to roll my eyes at every person who thought they knew game design better than the professionals. 
---
As an aside, this was my biggest source of contempt for the communities of the two major MMOs I worked on. Everyone had their brilliant idea about how to fix this or that; however, they all--through no fault of their own--did not have any real understanding of the complexity of a modern MMO. A tiny change to how one mechanic works could completely break an entire class, which in turn could break the entire economy, etc. 
---
Or, the constant "fix bugs first please!" Without realizing, hey, there are currently over 48k known bugs in dev track on this game, if we stopped feature development and just tried to fix them all before we did anything else, the players are going to get really bored really fast. 
---
In any case, while I can participate in gaming communities again without constantly getting annoyed, I still carry a lot of that baggage around--and eve, like no other game, has a community where a lot of people are vocal about 'the game is dying do this, do that, no do the other thing,' which of course occasionally triggers me.

---
How can you claim its a strawman when it's literally the original post of this comment chain? Also pvpers used local just as much as pve players. I think this change is dumb because it encourages people to move into nullsec blocs and rat in supers as the safest way.
---
Why should you ever think doing activities in Nulsec is peaceful or safe? Go back to highsec where you belong.
---
That’s my point that players will do what they want regardless of mechanics.  
---
Sorry kiddo
---
In HiSec
---
Oh come on now.
---
Good job!
---
A good goon is a dead goon. :)
---
Then Remove the mechanics that allow it. Which is a Task for CCP
---
It's always funny to see people cry bot. They get outbid on the market? It's a bot. Someone else flying something you can't afford? They bought it with a bot. Can't find anyone on your roam? Bots. Find someone on a roam. Bot.  C'mon guys.
---
Clearly the best idea ever.
---
Huntel salt , best salt

gitgud

giev mails!

---
he´s not wrong though v0v
---
They’ll build out of game tools for the same purpose.
---
More salt plz.
---
That's Eve, players doing what they want. I know you have this big hardon and just know in your sweet little heart that you're right and good goddamn is it adorable.
---
yes CCPLZ, i am bad, gief kellmails
---
lmao soooo salty they try kill them with bombers fail, try with wolf failed.... omg sooooo funny
---
Best part is they even lied about it.  After the initial outrage CCP Falclol said they made a mistake and were going to remove it from the store.  A month later and it's still for sale.  Reeee.
---
It's not CCP's fault major alliances decided to suck each other off.
---
Even if we accept your premise, if the result is stagnation, boredom, and inevitable loss of interest, from CCP's perspective, it's not a "game" problem or a "player" problem, it's a *business problem*.
---
Since addressing a *business problem* isn't really option to a *business*, and since they have levers for changing the game, but don't have levers for changing the players, that's what they have to do.
---
bwahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha*gasp*hahahahahahahahahaha
---
GL building a out of game tool that Increases SCAP Application, Cyno Mechanics, Anomalie Mechanics and whatever i surely forgot atm.
---
Exactly - it’s a player problem... not a game problem...
---
&gt; If the null groups would decide to fight each other
---
We do.
---
Tell me how such a mechanic could possibly exist
---
Bruh, you are such a salt mine I am not even trying and you are still producing. You are the ones slinging insults at someone again and again because you are angry your space pixels aren't safe anymore.
---
It's funny when people like you are so clueless to the amount of bots in EVE
---
let's give all drones kill mails what could go wrong
---
Them:
---
How can you shoot miners and newbros?
---
Me:
---
Easy... you don't lead 'em so much.
---
Ain't blackout hell?
---
Sounds great 👍
---
What ever fits that narrative you're being fed.
---
I’ll follow that logic then to ask in what ways should ccp pull levers that improve business...   
---
If they want the game to succeed and by your(and mine too) definition that’s by subs and revenue, knowing players gonna play... 
---
In what ways should ccp make gameplay changes to inspire more subs and logins?
---
Or as the first comment said this is just a karma grab.
---
Hey man nice comment! It really shows how in tune you are with the playerbase and how much Eve means to you!
---
&gt; Well, apart from /u/Jibrish - screw that guy &lt;3
---
Oh... :(
---
can I have your stuff?
---
Harvesters and geckos first.
---
And so was mine but people seemed to have to defend that what I am saying isn't true. Shocking that they can't see it about their preferred play style but are fine with stupid statements about others.
---
Probably a way for CCP to say "LOOK!  Metrics show people are killing trigs, the invasions aren't a shitastic failure!"
---
So, the goon with the 30 rorqs is the one buying PLEX from CCP to resub his accounts?
---
Or is it the 3 dork nanogang that logs in once a week and doesn't have time for Krab?
---
To be honest I dont care about local blackout one way or another as I am an explorer anyways, I’m just here for the drama lol
---
Eh kills per day are waaaay down from last year dude.  I’d argue you don’t
---
&gt; Youre not wrong about it being an easy karma grab
---
Not sure if I can reword this more clearly.
---
Nullsec being super safe, and full of newbie groups broke the progression of the game, newbs starting in hi sec, getting tired of that then joining smallish low sec groups, before wanting to try wormholes or null. It was really a progression that kept all 3 levels active.
---
Maybe don't spend time playing Eve then
---
Ork-paper-scissors*
---
I'm sure you're just a bot hunting fiend. /eyeroll
---
Ah ok balance issues - yes resource allocations and use of travel tools could be a more creative and fair way of forcing behavior change.  
---
I thought you were referring to say ways to track alliance status
---
I didn't claim to have the answers to every Eve problem, I'm just pointing out that, from the perspective of the business, there's really no such thing as a "player problem" because, "It's not our fault, it's all our customers' fault!" is an impossible position for them to take.
---
You haven't visited Kelavala, Delve, or any other major alliance space lately, have you? There has been a solid uptick in capital fights, and strategic fleets don't run due to numbers in local any more.
---
CCPlz...
---
/r/latestageryan =)
---
defeated, the former politician decides to deflect to save face on the cool internet message board forum
---
I'm staying out of this lol :D
---
Yeah honestly if he spread neuts he would probably have gotten out or killed everybody now that I think about it.
---
Gotta lock 1 dude and hit f1 tho
---
You can by ending the sentence there. Instead you added a qualifier to it and that's what I was addressing.
---
But is it really an impossible position?  When your product is the sandbox and access to it?  What the players choose to do inside the sandbox is of almost zero consequence.  You charge the entry price.  Maybe you create cool stories.  But largely the game unfolds by the players for the players.
---
I wasn't defeated - I was mocking you and your l33t pvp skillz.
---
It depends on the security status of the system as to how fast they respond but you definitely have enough time to get multiple volleys off. Catalysts just have the ability to provide the most dps during that timeframe for something that is cheap to throw away.
---
Nah, just notice it on my shopping trips to Teon from Molden Heath LS.  I know, I know,  Rens has better prices, but Teon is just so damn convenient.
---
Once something lands ongrid it's too late, even for the decent 10mn fits.
---
Must be a reddit bot
---
I misread what he said when I responded. The Porpoise took me about 2 minutes to kill. The Covetors died in 3-4 volleys
---
ohhhh okay, you're so slick.
---
Iif i had a dollar for every account i unsubbed i would get a pizza
---
&gt;Also the reason people stopped roaming is, that people saying stupid stuff like you usually **deny content by overblobbing or bosoning Frigs. How about jumping into Frigs too when Frigs are reported?**
---
If everyone in Delve had to drop what they were doing to honorbrawl everytime some saltposting turbovirgin jumped his shitfit frigate into the region, we'd have time for nothing else in this life.
---
Steal it from other people.
---
&gt; But is it really an impossible position?
---
Imagine presenting it in a board meeting when asked why you're not making your revenue growth numbers.
---
Burner missions
---
You should be punished for making me read this.
---
You being a goon has nothing to do with this being an easy karma grab? The first comment isnt related to you being a goon. I'm not quite understanding.
---
If you think ratting in supers is safer under local blackout you're insane. Each system can support fewer pilots of they're in supers as well, and people who can and want to super rat probably already are. They aren't choosing to use a VNI because they just really like it. It's because it's low risk, low attention, and low skill.
---
As for the OP - he was pretty clearly saying that tongue and cheek. Don't go around getting your panties in a bunch over every comment you don't like, you'll exhaust yourself.
---
Based on recent Hilmar comments at one of the Invasion tour events (I think it was DownUnder), I wouldn't rule that out tbh (i.e. that blackout wasn't planned for months, more like weeks).
---
In any case, the far more likely scenario is that CCP gathered statiscs about the anniversary SP event. They also sent a questionaire to players, regarding the event. Based on these, they concluded that the SP awards 'work' to get players to at least open up their clients, possible login too. Hence, they decided to do it again, during the summer period, when login numbers always drop.
---
That's what I think the most reasonable explanation vs either the 'panic reaction to blackout backlash' or the 'safety net because they anticipated a blackout backlash'.
---
I'd love to agree with you, and to a degree I do.
---
But here's the problem. People like to *win* and be *better* than others. In more ways than just killmails and dank frags. The way Eve is set up currently makes having more, bigger ships the best way to win. It's largely N+1. There isn't a penalty or really any reason to not always try to out form your enemy or recruit more dudes. So what's the best way to get these ships? Farm. Rat. Crab. Doing this uninterrupted gives line members these ships faster. That's why the Goon turtle model is far and away the best objective way to play eve and "win" because they do it at a scale that is significantly higher than even #2.
---
There also really isn't anything to fight over honestly. That's why most of the meta is to content deploy, join little sigs, ect. People join fleets they don't enjoy to get yelled at by autists they don't like to kill structures the enemy doesn't even use to help grind sov they don't even want so they can have at least some sense of "accomplishment."
---
It depends how much ISK you have right now.
---
Personally i would advise you to start a new account with invite, tonight, and here's why.
---
You get 300k sp (roughly), at start.
---
With invite it's +750k sp.
---
With the current event going, you can get 200k sp unallocated.
---
\--- up to this point you get 1.25m sp char (mostly unallocated) for literally no cost to you.
---
You can contract the stuff from your old char to your new char.
---
Play both, but if you can afford daily alpha injectors, transfer them to your new char, to your new account.
---
\---
---
Once you hit 5m sp, buy the 5euro starter pack (1m unallocated sp).
---
On top of this, as long as the account is less than 35d (and alpha) you can use a Standard Cerebral Accelerator (13-14m on contracts atm), which gives 20% to damage and +3 to all attributes untill your account reaches 35d of age.
---
If you start now, +3 means 2.25 sp/minute extra, which means 113k sp extra (and the extra damage bonus).
---
If you don't have the isk, just say your char's name ingame and i'll contract you 2 of them in Jita for free.
---
&gt;  we spot some action in local 
---
Fake news!
---
At odds with the players: trying to please both the Indy guys and the pvpers at the same time to create a balanced game. Yah, I don’t envy u guys. May the drifters be with you.
---
The game you're looking for is star citizen, lmk how that works out for you, since you know what you want.
---
The Rachael's picture behind man, I'm crying so hard
---
I'v always liked delonewolf, very chill and one of the few people that sound like they are actually enjoying the game and not being atry hard
---
Players do what they want *given the mechanics*. Big difference. 
---
For example, there's no counter to titans besides more titans. You can fight subcaps outnumbered because you've got tools to work with; booshing, ewar, kiting, bombs, counter comps etc. Doesn't work like that for supers, they're immune to everything. So, do I own sov? Yes. Do I have more titans than the guy next to me? No. Can I blue someone with titans to even the count? Maybe. Guess I'll blue someone then. What other choice do I have?
---
Regular changes to game mechanics are the only thing that keep a game like this fresh. You can't just leave it and expect people to create the perfect game for you because people are only interested in what's good *for them*. If it's in my interest to drop supers on everything in my space then that's what I'll do, regardless of how it affects the game as a whole. Keeping it from shitting up the game as a whole is CCP's job.
---
I\`ll say only this: There are MMO games out there and then there is EVE Online!
---
Thats pretty dumb. It needs more PG now.
---
"People that aren't feeding me free kills aren't in space doing things" ok.
---
Everyone just wants free and easy kills, and CCP wants to make it happen because PLEX, that's why. Can't wait for all the crying from the trolls when there isn't anyone to shoot but each other.
---
What if supers just weren't so good at everything?
---
Shitposting. For sure the shitposting.
---
I mean, I get that it gets old, but I'm all for new players coming in. I still pop into those and give advice for that reason...
---
It's really hard to visualise 10 years of never ending harassment and PTSD into a picture though.
---
Nice try karmawhore.
---
You could well be right after I posted I thought this is CCP they may well have just said Drop a blackout and it happened not unlike some of the other stuff that has wandered into the game and left people thinking WTF. We will see how it all falls out
---
I thought Mittens was calling for boson titan death camps of hell on every gate in Delve, though?
---
oh you sweet summer child
---
All over the place. Bot level 4 runners, bot mining, bot courier missions.
---
As a former wormholer; what is local?
---
must be
---
That might make fewer people want to own one, but it wouldn't do anything to reduce the number that exist now or discourage them from massing without support.
---
r/isk?
---
Yeah, and it's the same in Karmafleet (where I started) and Horde. All of the big blocs have great SIGs and groups which you can roll small gang and actually learn the game in, but none of them push you in that direction. The problem is that unless you end up in them (many of which are vouch-only), you never really learn shit about mechanics.
---
Put a guy in Karmafleet and a guy in Horde and now you have alts who are at least blue to most major null alliances.
---
Expecting that players, working within game mechanics, will act against their own best interests is the thinking of a child. That's no crime, but I weary of it. Good luck on your quest sweet prince!
---
All over the place. Bot level 4 runners, bot mining, bot courier missions. You name it, there's a bot for it.
---
This is low quality bait made by some 3lite xx_pVpGoD_xx type to try and make people who oppose his viewpoint look stupid. 
---
Nobody would say "then I'll get killed by an elite PVPer" apart from some fool blowing his own trumpet for the third venture kill he's got this year.
---
Be better.
---
Sry, went AFK for a few. Hope you didn't report me for being a bot.
---
I read your comment like it was a ms office product popup and loved it. The mental image of clippy popping up around the game giving suggestions to players
---
It sucks.  I have 3 Omega accounts and play every minute that I can. 
---
 It's kinda like video meth, but your teeth don't rot out....well, they might.
---
There's a difference between murder in everything in a hilarious way as it jumps in to system, and stopping them being able to jump in to being with.
---
Only the second one indicates a bot, since drones will keep attacking rats even if you’re afk.
---
It’s a 16 year old game and the gaming world has changed to battle royale - 15 minute consumption bites.  
---
Ask the board what they’re doing to fill the company’s pipe of new products.
---
why would anyone report? CCP doesn't care about botting anyways m8
---
Read that out loud again, to yourself.
---
If you can find the general location(s) of the IP address(es) used during the time your accounts were compromised, that would help. Even if CCP made the worst case assumption and claimed that you were using a VPN or something like that, it'd strengthen your case.
---
Lol. You realize it's all about n+1 titans now? Imperium has more or at least as many titans as the rest of null combined, including legacy.
---
The Security Updates via the Dev Blog beg the differ.
---
Nathan explosion is the new voice of NEAR3?
---
the future looks black.
---
Bearholes are sadly mandatory for any decent group, since static farming interferes with day to day wormhole life and home sites aren't sufficient to fund even the smallest of groups.
---
Beacause it will make bomber online.
---
Bomber could cloack (so basically they could avoid to be under fire of super weapon). They could voert cyno. They have huge dps. 
---
you do'nt prefer gold ammo on bomber to one shoot all ship?
---
The you give them something to fight over that more than n+1 titans can realistically compete with?
---
Resource availability
---
&gt; If you scroll down further, you can see that CCP doesn't bother to provide information on the Magic 14 themselves and is just referring to the Uni-Wiki page.
---
I actually thought it was kind of cool that they did that...
---
Oh you sweet summer child
---
Also, its slightly more in line with Sansha being the amarr/caldari mix that has favors shields.
---
The Sansha branch of the 'right to rule' epic arc also gives a shield implant as a reward.
---
I guess that's great that Dscan works out to 16 AU.
---
Sansha are shield focused. They also take slaves.
---
It uses the overview tab presets, so yes.
---
If someone enjoys station trading would you call them cancer too?
---
This sub has a terminal case of "stop liking things I don't like"
---
Not deflecting anything. You idiots think anybody in nullsec is a bot.
---
Safer in general? No, all pve without local is less safe, obviously. Relatively safer when compared to other ships? Absolutely, pop a cyno and get saved. This change absolutely pushes people more towards ratting in supers and rorqual mining if they want that safe pve.
---
Sadly is the key word :( Even as a mostly solo pilot I had a 5-3 for krabbing. Now I think you have to get TDSIN approved for one.
---
Yep.  Previous events like this offered stuff that took some time to add to the game.  This is something they could shove out *really* quickly.
---
Guess those sub cancellation numbers were starting to look pretty bleak.
---
You're defeating your own argument. That's inherently a game problem not player.
---
Tis both.  Players tend to gravitate to the most popular or most efficient game playstyles. The most efficient playstyles are defined by the set of rules in the game.  
---
Mostly this is the result of CCP making dumb ass changes without thinking about what they would do.
---
I see people are enjoying spamming bomber fleets with no local because ganking is piss easy
---
I understand wanting them to be even stronger because you’re having fun flying your cheap frigates
---
Fuck off with wanting nerfs to match your playstyle
---
Judging by your post history on Reddit I'm just gonna walk away from this now.
---
Ah yes, stealth bombers. The botting scourge of EVE
---
You have a point. Where's the guy who cried about warp stabs?
---
Well, to start it off: We agree that there is not an extreme more amount of plex on the market than was 10 years ago, right?
---
The amount of player CP count shows that at least in 2008 were about as many players as there are now. 
---
And the mineral prices were also the same (https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/1A95tvHuERlTBB1TOPzEL5/1c7e96ffa095c54d8c1404814c88a7e2/9d_economy.indices.png) (lets disregard that the consumer price was actually lower back than)
---
And plex prices in 2009 were around 300-350million (old plex) Currently, they are at around 2bn, so it's about 6 times the value. (well I did exaggerated a bit, but still proves my point)
---
IF the plex vs isk price was not elastic, we would see a massively higher amount plex. (of course not 6 times more, but definetely massively more)
---
You say that I made the assumption: "Everyone who now buys from RMT, would buy from CCP". This is simply not what I wrote. I said that (SOME) people would buy from CCP. 
---
We have 3 ways: Person X would buy for 10$ 500 PLEX from RMT, now RMT is no more. X can now:
---
A- buy 500PLEX from CCP for 20$ (fixed demand for something specific)
---
B- buy 250PLEX from CCP for 10$ (fixed budget, i.e. planned gift)
---
C- not buying at all. (makes no rational sense, but hey, I sometimes behave like this too)
---
As long as NOT EVERYONE choses C, CCP is effectively losing money with RMT. Additionally, every PLEX bought from RMT instead of CCP directly removes (respectively does not generate additional) PLEX supply. There is also a small removal of PLEX, when accounts with PLEX are banned, although CCP already stated that they have the option to re-seed those PLEX.
---
So, please tell me. How exactly would CCP think RMT is good? If they wanted to just press the isk/PLEX price higher, they could do so, without risking RMT losses.
---
I second the recommendation for Eve University.
---
Their whole purpose is basically to be a "stepping stone" corporation which teaches new players the game mechanics and how to do things.
---
Go back and look at the entire comment chain, I replied to a person saying this had to do with goons and then it went from there.
---
Yes, I have mine to show only player ships
---
not really, just the plainly obvious ones but :ok_hand:
---
If they had a niche or weaknesses like every other ship then it wouldn't matter how many are amassed because you could counter them with other ships. For example, if they lose all their ewar resistance bonuses you could jump 20 supers with ewar burst projectors in near a 500 titans and sensor dampen the entire blob.
---
All the other ships in the game are useless once a fight escalates to supers, that's the core problem. It doesn't mean we need some new uber bomber, it means supers themselves are too good.
---
Except it shows the default ones on top.  The default ones are pretty worthless when you want to customize everything.
---
Oh?
---
If you’re that desperate to kill board whore get an alt account and blow it up repeteadly with plex in the cargo
---
now you gotta tell us what you found
---
There's been plenty of these before as well.
---
As another pointed out, super ratting is now the safest way to rat, and this will encourage more people to do that.
---
Goons being Goons
---
Because you totally cant copy paste a bot vni name onto your own from dscan
---
I mean, they're not too great at ti-di?

---
Khan, let the dude have his fun. This game isn't yours.
---
Yeah. That's no good.
---
Go back, kill more, repeat!
---
Neat little story! Glad yall had fun and learned! Hope you ventute out again and more of your mates join!
---
I've been operating under the assumption that the blackout isn't permanent; either because it'll just end or because if the introduction of a new structure that restores it. I have a Titan of my own, so I'm kinda asking to nerf my own playstyle here. Not that I have any authority here. I'm just spitballing.
---
I mean you can't say it's a bad solution
---
Though I still find a random thorax from 2014 in my assets or something time to time.
---
I've already made the 2nd ticket but when I click the link it said the page had been removed or moved somewhere else. Idk if that's normal or if CCP is ignoring my tickets now. Either way how would you suggest letting them know about the different ip addresses as I do have them on my log in account management. Would making another ticket work? I heard they don't like it when people send in multiple tickets when one's already open. I've also seen people say that they contacted GMs on reddit as a last resort so idk.
---
Just kill their krabs and make it unfun to live in that hole if you really want it, but C5s are so plentiful (and C3 statics are aids) that it's hardly worth the effort.
---
so.... scroll down?
---
Ok so the mechanic that comes to mind would be just making bigger and bigger ships?   I feel like at some point it would just get hysterical (if not already). 
---
In your argument concluding “what choice do I have”... you could choose to fight them?  You could concede defeat?  You could move to where you’re competitive on ships and members comparative strengths.  Why is it that I’m entitled to sit in a sov situation if by the given game mechanics I don’t really deserve to sit there (aside from just making friends with a heavyweight).  Oh because the behavior of the players allows me to sit there.  
---
Regular changes yes - but why does that have to swing a pendulum way back one direction that pulls a rug out from a particular gameplay.  Why cant new introductions of content changes etc be centered around resources availabilities, force the players into conflict over a treasure.
---
how ? not ratting = less escalations = less DED modules = increased price for DED modules
---
not mining = less minerals = less moon goo = less drugs = less components from reactions = less T2 ships = increased price in T2 ships and T2 modules.
---
Let me know how my ISK value will increase if the prices increase but with 1 bil i can by far less than i could 2 weeks back. It's called inflation when prices ramp up but income remains the same. Get any 5th grade economy book and read it.

Premium drones soon tm

Sincerely

The Hecate King
---
No I’m introducing a mechanic that could potentially create conflict but would it?
---
So you become a leftist if you dislike the blackout? Good to know. 🤣😂
---
they're actually against the EULA as they do not contain the full client screen
---
This is true like cynos, unlimited resources, inherently identical resources spawns, etc?
---
Please biomass, it's in everyone's best interest.
---
Could very well be. But they're still a thing.
---
Excellent thank you for the added info :)
---
Uh ... What? Bombers can't shoot while cloaked, bombers avoiding damage from Titans is the whole point of the idea (to make them Titan killers) and it's not as if this world make them less vulnerable to regular subcaps. IDK WTF you're on about with the file ammo thing so I'm just going to assume you were frothing when you wrote that part.
---
Your argument and "change my mind" post is that the problems are with players not mechanics. And now you're suggesting that mechanics need to change.
---
lmao.
---
"*MAN, CCP Falcon is such a nice cool awesome guy he's like...*"

&gt;how to karma whore 101
---
First comment
---
&gt;Or as the first comment said this is just a karma grab.
---
Still nothing about you being a goon here.
---
Unless you meant your first comment
---
&gt;Yes because this is being critical of goons. This is being critical of anyone who doesn't support it and trying to score free karma because most of reddit doesn't support it.
---
Which still doesnt say anything about you being a goon. It's talking about people, who dont support the blackout, grabbing free and easy karma.
---
As if the last 3+ years of this sub hasnt been a goon circlejerk of free karma about rorqs and how much mining goons do. lmao
---
Check this out https://youtu.be/kf3xQt2T85Y
---
I’m asking what mechanics would change player behavior?  Because the player behavior will revert back to this same position no matter what ccp does.  Resource conflicts come to mind as possible but would it really?
---
Where is the mountains of evidence you have to support this? Or is just your feelings and anyone who disagrees is a botter?
---
What's with all the Stratioses ?
---
Specifically I don't know, I'm sure that would help. My point is the game is designed currently in a way that care bearing is the most effective way to be better than other people.
---
I can rat all day without 1 interruption it's about the system..
---
Haha all the krabs unsubscribed for this.
---
That doesn't make sense. Space is finite. Most groups are already crowded with supers. Super ratting will be riskier without local because groups will be more spread and ratting in general will be riskier - so somehow people who aren't *currently* willing to take the risk to super rat will be *more* willing when it's *riskier?* It doesn't make sense. 
---
Currently super ratting in most NS groups is extremely safe. Without local it will have some non-trivial risk. Most people don't risk their supers.
---
How about fuck off? It's good to see newer and smaller groups going out and trying things.
---
But still riskier than super ratting is today. There are lots of people who don't want to risk a super as it is; they won't choose to risk a super when it's more likely they will get dropped.
---
Exactly this ^
---
It's still true that TDSIN hog all the shit C5s to run duo rattlesnakes though
---
Wtb entry
---
If you want me to read your opinion add a tldr r/eve has had too many walls of text lately.
---
hey, what /u/Cartoons_and_cereals said was correct, but there's also something else. I don't really enjoy fighting people that can't fight back, and that's basically what happens with trigfleet 8/10 times. Either you completely dunk a target that cannot defend itself or they drop the hammer and you have to run. There's almost never a point of tension, where, if you play your cards right and come up with creative solutions you might or might not make it. It's almost always a complete dunk for either side.
---
now that alot of more "ppl" live in drone null the augmented drone price will go down again + less ppl making new exavators so cheaper drone ai = even cheaper so it will be a cheap killmail
---
4 years ago the drone null data site and escalation you can get from them was a hidden goldmine (drops all augmented drone bpc's) now you just want the parts in the cans
---
Covert Ops Cyno.
---
pretty much.  citadels are also huge allowing near impregnable regions with easy docking / tether etc.  
---
I hate this no local crap for the same reason.  It will be fun for a short while, but the type of gamestyle that results from it will suck balls.  There appears to be no long term plan at CCP other than try and drive short term profits.
---
The safety from wormholes should mostly come from how quiet they are, and how rare someone rolling into you is. With sieged down dreads, where you're guarenteed to lose everything, it's still worthwhile. Losing a 500m snake or two once in a lifetime would still be fine.
---
Naw, I station trade. It's specifically rorqals.
---
I’m conceding that a resource conflict could be a better more engaging step in that direction and could potentially challenge the current meta of n+1 and blue all of eve.  It’s at least a more engaging and exciting gameplay than simply the removal of a commonly accepted game system.  
---
How would it feel if ccp were in a position to be able to roll our with engaging resource conflicts to inspire people to sub/log in instead of having to bribe the players with skill points and free mtcs.  
---
When they fall into the trap of the latter they players become entitled to free stuff and wait for handouts.  If ccp is providing new and engaging content for which players can participate with that becomes exciting and then I want to play more and am anxious for the next one.
---
What if bomber pilots just got good at the game?
---
&gt;  Do you just randomly go to the mall and sit there with 20 strangers just because of "its socializing"? i bet no. 
---
Have you need visited a mall's parking garage recently? I bet I could find mall rats in every single mall by me.
---
But currently I agree with you. I returned to eve, not playing since 2010 and I have recently just been enjoying playing solo and just talking in my NPC corp. Been doing L4 missions and some trig invasions while I slowly relearn the game ***on my own pace***. I want to start doing exploration and maybe combat sites. 
---
I think eventually I will attempt and join a WH corp as that playstyle seems very interesting to me. However like I said it will be on my own pace.
---
Since frigate bombers fit BS sized weapons it would make more sense to introduce a cruiser sized bomber that fits capital weapons. 
---
A T2 cruiser that gets bonuses to Citadel torps/cruise missiles would be a viable counter/ganker for capitals/supers. Yet easily dispatched by a proper sub fleet.
---
From what I've seen, other progression paths exist as well. We have people that join Brave proper for a while, then move out to smaller group in low or J-space when they want something a little more personal than a large alliance. The high sec portion is generally missing though.
---
Whether or not this is of the same volume as before isn't anything I have data for. Would be an interesting population study actually and if anyone thinks they have the means to pull it off I'd love to see it.
---
The thing is those events usually added some sort of new items that took at least a little bit of time to make and stick in the game.  Like those little tokens in the last ones that described events from Eve's history.  Yeah, easy to add, but they still take time.
---
This is a super-quick thing to shove in, and it's also something that appeals to PvE players far more than rewards like random faction ammo.
---
most people say to join a big corp but he doesn't find big fleets fun, and he wants to know what do now
---
Yes it’s a lazy fix aimed to swing a pendulum way far in another direction.
---
I don't disagree with much of what you said really. But you said change your mind, and it seems you have
---
CCP-Falcon now that i have your attention i have been messaging and emailing CCP wondering if as i know the rules on cash prize rewards wondering if in the tournament we are going to hold soon if we can give actual cash prize.  
---
waiting on the green light from you guys o7  
---
Sincerely Yours   
---
He likes playing solo
---
MCT is useful to have omega on 3 accounts for the price of one, as long as you only need one of these accounts active at once. Prime example:
---
Hauler alt on a pvp account
---
Scouts to seed wormholes
---
PI alts
---
Easy, market PvP.
---
Don't, just don't.
---
i feel for you!, luckily a rattlesnake aint a major loss, even though it can feel so for a new-ish player!
---
Good point.
---
Except the random faction ammo part, doubt anyone liked that.
---
Pot, meet kettle.
---
Fair enough, I had never heard them referred to as that. They were always called "burner missions".
---
ikr!
---
No I haven’t changed my mind at all.  I think players would ultimately align and set up trade agreements based on historical boundaries.  
---
I think that creating resource conflicts is at least more creative and less lazy approach for them to take.  But the players will ultimately decide who gets what.
---
Your Quafe shirt! its epic
---
I can dig it.
---
Sigh. Nevermind
---
Guy in Brave and you've now got 90% of null
---
I know it can use one, just surprised some ppl base a doctrine around that in lowsec.
---
I think these posts are fake.  It’s just paid marketing.
---
I do the Market PvP and agree 100%. This blackout has already spiked prices in several of the items I trade in resulting in some of the best profits this year for me.
---
Yup I can’t seem to overcome this either.  The player behavior wins again!
---
I guess they want those bot accounts badly back to the game, so they kicked season of skills ... suddenly
---
does that include streaming? I remember them banning the use of "super clients" made out of snippets of multiple full clients.     
---
But if he uses a full client each but only shows part of it on a stream? 
---
idk. man
---
Now the gold question: What delay does the stream have? x)
---
lol move on buddy
---
So much this. The elitist mentality that has become rife since the blackout is leaving a bad taste in my mouth with eve. If you dislike the blackout because you think it will negatively impact the game overall, even if you are having fun PvPing gets you shouted down by a dozen or so "Reeing" neck beards that won't let anyone talk down the new cult of blackout.
---
Yeah you pointed out exactly what I mean the volume is the key.
---
You do you. Have fun :)
---
Even if that were the case (I kinda doubt it is but who knows) I'd still like to see new players come into the game. 
---
If someone discovers Eve, then pops over to Reddit to check it out a bit more (which I totally do for other games) and see's one of those and decides to give it a shot then that's cool by me.
---
The boat show probably the best content since CNN.
---
I do not believe that outright removing asset safety will have a positive impact on the game. On paper your points are accurate, people have more reason to defend,, but in reality I think you will see people get less risky, and  keep everything in stations or places they know they cant lose them, and in the long run well see less risk, and less activity, as people become limited in where and what they can be fighting.
---
This needs a row with 'Season of Skill'
---
Thankfully I joined a corporation where the 10-20 other guys I'm with have become my friends and aren't strangers.  I enjoy the differences we all have, and they all have become close to me.
---
You would all die.
---
No, seriously, you can do some insane stuff with a fleet of rookie bombers, and TEST routinely wipes out Frat fleets using about a dozen experienced bomber pilots (I got 290 kills from one run earlier this month). It's a play style that really rewards getting good and punishes being bad. So yeah, give us a full fleet of veteran bombers on demand and pretty much everything would burn.
---
How are you this oblivious to basic game mechanics in a game you’ve been playing for a long time?
---
I'm thinking about how to do a population study. I'm not the greatest at scripting but I'll see if I'm able to actually look into the data on this. 
---
I might be in Brave, but it's a good question to ask.
---
No pb; you can counter drop at home easily too.
---
The lore and how it can be seen by players ingame
---
I'd rather they go with a T2 ABC or T3 ABC, since inherently their whole niche is high dps glass cannons. Would be nice to see a T2 nado, or a Naga with missiles.
---
Can be balanced pretty easily to be dangerous to large ships, but easily dunked on by BS, cruisers, frigates etc.
---
I get the feeling deadspace modules are gonna increase in price due to lack of bots.
---
It's a free market economy. "Increased reward" is pretty nebulous.
---
1 hour of ratting in a vni is enough for a fully fit hurricane, or a cheap t1 rigged ferox. Both of which are standard megabloc doctrine ships.
---
3 hours of ratting is enough for a muninn, 4.5 for an eagle.
---
Do you have alliance ops every hour and lose ships every hour?
---
What joy, such emergence gameplay. /s
---
no local should stay permanent  so that the only viable playstyles are ganking being ganked or credit card warrioring, and it will die leaving us all to be free  
---
what they absolutely shouldnt do is remove super capitals, because that would only serve to reduce null blocs powers reduce isk faucets and encourage fights to happen, because then the game will grow and then we will be stuck here for another 16 years
---
Lol but you guys have supers and gates and stuff it’s not entirely the same. Especially considering your anomalies respawn insystem so you don’t actually have to jump around much.
---
Maybe stuff like getting rolled out in the middle or a fight because someone next door wanted to krab, or getting rolled into while krabbing were more of a thing I would entertain the idea. But you can still gate camp a dead end pocket and krab mindlessly to your hearts content.
---
The solution is to give supers a role, that is not "beat everything else".      
---
Make them not apply to subcaps at all. Give them something to shoot that doesn't cap out at 6 titans worth of dps.     
---
They need a niche, but being all mighty is not it.
---
Not if it's already public knowledge.
---
Incorrect assessment. But I wouldn't expect better.
---
Yeah but how many hours to inject another titan alt? That's all that matters these days.
---
Fight over what?     
---
You can arrange fights all you want, that isn't half as fun as fighting for your home; Or evicting your grudge-enemy.      
---
But with the current sov/Citadel mechanics? Might as well pay someone to get kicked in the balls, that would probably be more fun.
---
Retarded, next.
---
guessing they want to up the logins that went way down due to black out.
---
The issue is with any study of new playrrs is bots will greatly skew the numbers.
---
Actually a good point. It’s weird that the Pith-C type was cheaper than the Caldari navy invuln by like 100Mil.
---
If citadels weren't as cancerous to destroy, we would probably see more content tbh.
---
Why did you ask this question?
---
Same goal here mate :)
---
You wouldn’t be ratting with a VNI to inject titan alts. You’d be in. Carriers or supers. Let’s be real.
---
Red vs Blue is another good option for the same reason. They're not political.
---
Yeah. YouTube's apparently completely fucked itself and a lot of content is suddenly showing up as "unavailable". Maybe it's finally dying.
---
thats still people to shoot though. and often going to be a better fight than botting vnis were anyways.
---
I don't know why I follow this sub but there is something special about reading posts and comments and not knowing what anyone is referring to.
---
This is the closest thing yet to getting to changes they could make that would create conflict and break up big groups.  
---
Resources and citadels are definitely a problem.  
---
Nope let’s break local.  Awesome idea.  So bad we have to bribe people with SP and free shit to stay logged in so our Korean overlords don’t cancel the whole thing.
---
We have data for number of bots banned so can at least attempt to adjust for that.
---
If you have the inclination, having a couple of alpha alts isn't a bad thing. The races are largely meaningless now so go with the aesthetic you like. 
---
Training the magic 14 is a good shout, maybe look to specialise what a couple can do, such as have one that specs in scanning (great if you end up in wormholes) maybe one that does ewar, one that can pvp and one that can do pve. 
---
That way, even if you're bored, or stuck somewhere, you'll always have alts available to do other stuff, especially now with the amount of free SP getting thrown around.
---
Not the greatest season for ideas is it
---
Good on CCP for maintaining that site. I hope they add some means of recording the names of everyone "interred" there.
---
&gt; wondering if in the tournament we are going to hold soon if we can give actual cash prize.
---
Nope.
---
I can't give you the answer you're looking for really, but on lower settings eve isn't exactly a hardware intensive game, so you might find you'll be fine. 
---
Probably try building it up one account at a time and see if you hit a bottleneck
---
Not tellin
---
We may not be the best PVPers in ART5 but hell if we don't have fun in the process! To hell with killboards, as long as at least someones ship explodes then we leave happy.
---
Vorlash has it on the head. Fit for pvp, or fit for exploration. 
---
If you try to pvp in a mixed loadout ship you'll die to a dedicated pvp boat, if you are doing exploration in it you'll be slower and more vulnerable than a faster in and out explorer. 
---
Stratios's are a prime example of this, people try to fit them to do everything, and tend to do nothing well.
---
&gt; when there isn't anyone to shoot but each other.
---
&gt; anyone to shoot but each other.
---
&gt; each other.
---
That's a valid target in my books
---
AND YOU DECIDE TO GO ##WHERE?!##
---
Then why weren't they shooting each other before? Lol
---
the problem whit no asset safty is the ppl that have to take breaks (deployments and othere irl stuff) then can comeback and have lost all the stuff they had 
---
some of them would just logout again forever, a better way is to give the ppl that kills a citadel 10-20% of the asset safty cost ppl have to pay to get the stuff back
---
ofc someone will think of someway to abuse it but thats eve
---
Agreed, but if it wasn't happening before, what's going to change?
---
because citadel timers give me menstrual anxiety.
---
yes, they're based on the real clock.
---
lol :) 
---
well, sorry, let me think.... no, still just lol :)
---
Tbh look at wicked detorid and insmother it's pretty dead too
---
yes, I have an overview tab called ScanSafe and I have my D-scan window set to. It looks for things like ships, probes, bubbles, anything I may need to know about while running cloaky
---
you can explore solo, look for a group to hang with, without joining a corporation. Maybe try joining a redemption road fleet or a spectre fleet. There's quite a few channels to lurk in hopes of finding your place, like bringing solo back, bombers bar, spectre fleet, amarr locals, redemption road, etc.
---
&gt;is pretty nebulous
---
It's a hot take, damn it!
---
a 24h turnaround is going to be a tall order for P1 &gt; P4.
---
Usually by the time I am making a P4 there have been some P3's and P2's that would be a net loss to produce, so my P4 planets are usually a mixture of P2-4 production.
---
My latest factory planet for example is making organic mortar applicators. For this one I am running 1 OMA factory, 3 Robotics factories, and 12 P2 factories (for mechanical parts and consumer electronics). There are also 4 launchpads and 4 storage facilities.  
---
If I bring all the P1's for a batch its about 50km3, and the condensates are a net loss to produce so I imported them (another 10km3); or in other words the drop is one occator trip.  
---
10km3 of the P1's will make 987 units, divided by 3 factories (9 units/hr) should take about 4.5 days to complete.  
---
The P4 single factory uses 6 robotics and 40 of another P1, so to consume all 987 of the robotics would take just under 7 days.  
---
After crunching 987 of the robotics only about 1/3 of the P1's for the P4 production would be used up (6580 units over 7 days).
---
If I had 5 P4 factories then I would need probably 2 launchpads just for that specific P1? (or 1 LP and 1 storage), but I certainly wouldn't be able to produce the P3's on the same planet in that case and have the P3 production keep up.  
---
For each P4 factory in my example case 2 P3 factories would need to be running to keep the output/input balanced.  
---
So to sum it up, it literally depends on your goals. In my case I am in it for production profit more than having the final product. If all you want is faster production of the final product you could probably have 10 P4 factories running, but would need to import everything else.
---
It has been a little bit since a fresh setup, but I think your main limitation will be how many storage/launchpads can be put down. Factories themselves are pretty cheap (cpu/pg).  
---
Hope this helps!
---
I've been playing for like 6 almost 7 years now. Sh*t its been that long lol.  But I've been a near 99.98% solo player. Only had a corp of like 3 ppl for like 6months. 
---
But yeah its relaxing. And well it kinda ruined all other games for me. After my first billion isk ship loss oh so long ago. No other game seems good enough.
---
Still though, relaxing, every day....for at least 2 hours. Lol 
---
Hello, my name is Aspen and I'm an Eve junkie
---
Fly however you wanna 
---
o.7
---
Mostly any decent alliance will understand that real life comes first, this is a game after all. 
---
Although they won't like it, a lot of the big alliances really aren't that different in what they can offer to a new player. Have a think about what it is you want to do, then sit in their recruitment channels and ask questions, see what 'feels' right to you. 
---
Don't worry if you join one and find you aren't enjoying it, theres plenty more out there!
---
Good luck

[KRABS!!!](https://youtu.be/93lrosBEW-Q)

I am not sure what I am looking at, an envelope meaning what?
---
Madness and lies.
---
Theres plenty of them out there, they are just having to work together a bit more now.
---
i haven´t actively hunted in years chap. but i will bring a fight when the opportunity arises. because i didn´t spend my whole eve career in hisec lvl4s and null anos and actually know how to deal with scary scary PvP. god bless.
---
the hobo leaks actually answers this for you. They are being renamed amulet.
---
ROUGH. RIDERS.
---
I wish I could forget eve and find this sub. It must be glorious to read when you don't know wtf is going on.
---
I can't check my own setup atm, but i have a P1-P4 insert planet with CCU IV that is running fine. I've got 2 launchpads that hold the delivered P1 input (4 types each), and one storage that gets the final ingredient and the final product. All factories collect from and deliver to a storage, but nothing should get lost if it's connected properly. The cycle time and unit consumption of each factory matches a certain number if lower factories to keep it supplied. If the whole cycle is running and properly connected, only the final product will need to be stored; any of the lower steps feed straight into the next factory (which has room available when the cycles match up. So if it's all well connected, I dont see what can overflow your storage unless you're over- producing one of the lower stages in such an amount that can't be processed
---
I watch delonewolf consistently.
---
Jintalks has some okay shows worth looking if it tickles my fancy at the time.
---
I tried the podcasts and stuff but at the end of the day they’re so drawn out and not that entertaining. There’s like no good enough personality to fill the long format yet. Too many long pauses and not enough engaging content. 
---
Also ain’t nobody got time to watch Markeedragons 6hr youtube videos.
---
Lokley Theo
---
what are they going to do, ban him?
---
&gt;citadels 
---
These were released in 2016 right (if my googling is correct). As I stopped playing in 2010 I never really felt the impact from these structures.
---
Sad state of eve where people would rather the game die than not fit their exact idea on how it should operate.
---
If pvpers just wanted to meet each other for honorabru fights they would do it in rvb, tourneys, abyssal etc. This is about hunting grounds and counter-activity, it's really not hard to understand.
---
ofc its immensea
---
retards
---
Honestly, that's a fair point.
---
If it persists that's excellent, although I'm curious what the logistical ramifications for those capital fights will be with the decline in ratting and mining returns without local in the long term; hopefully it strikes an adequate balance. 
---
More importantly, how does this help the greater EVE problem of integrating new players? Some of the larger new recruits in null sec were, oddly enough, new bros looking to get in on those fleet battles. I'd make the argument that WH style PVP is probably one of the most intimidating skill sets to acquire in eve. Whereas before they'd have relative safety under umbrellas and local spikes, now they have nothing and our response is: "Tough shit, adapt" (Or CCPs: Hey bro, wanna buy some SP.. oh wait nevermind we can't do that.. *cough* What? Who said buy SP? Hey Look: no local and drifter invasions.")
---
I'm concerned we're creating an environment where CODE slams them in high sec, and WH elitists slam them if they join newbie friendly corps in null sec. Hopefully there's a sufficiently large enough set of people that can endure through that to sustain the aging player base.
---
Hey look a stupid ass idea that OP thinks is great because they lack understanding of core game concepts! What a truly novel and original post!
---
He wants his character unbanning... This aint gonna help that case is it now?
---
oh shit a positive comment :)
---
it's not going to happen either way tbh
---
Ex player from a few years ago here. 
---
Was thinking of getting back into the game, but I’m not really sure the state of things now. I mostly did single and small fleet PvP in FW, and honestly don’t really have much of an interest in large scale battles unless it’s in a smaller ship. Obviously still have all the skill points from before, but my knowledge of how to play has atrophied to essentially nothing in the last few years. 
---
My question is if small scale pvp is still relevant in the age of citadels? Is FW still alive in any meaningful way? Would it be more appropriate to look towards nulsec or WH space for this kind of PvP? Would it make more sense for me to look towards smaller corps or larger to find a place that doesn’t mind taking me in and essentially teaching me pvp all over again?
---
CCP have known to fuck up... Look at the whole Brisc crap that went on a few months ago...
---
Xoxoxo
---
log into your unused account and biomass please
---
Since there is some tension on this point I decided to satisfy my position as unofficial foreign minister for feelgooddiplomacy and coveringupmistakes and put into execution the following statement: We do NOT have, I repeat, the above mentioned independed high sec corp does NOT have a spy in each null sec alliance. I declare this case closed now. Should you feel the need to bring it up again, expect retaliation from our lawyers.
---
Guilty....
---
Well say goodbye to small corps.
---
MEGA BLOCKS WIN!

yes i understand your opinion, i search a good solution to stopped the blueballs and forced to engage

If 4000+ bots caught each quarter doesn't convince you that there is a botting problem. I don't know what will. And those are just the ones that got caught.
---
Sounds good, doesn't work.
---
or is this a troll?
---
You literally posted the comment about it being related to goons and stopped short of the next 2.
---
EvanMcLean is sometimes fun to watch idk

I'm mostly the same, in the end.

Dernnit. I wanna know what's in your secret sauce.

That's some peak salt

Ty! So, if you jump immediately before DT with an 'insta'-recap fit, you'll be able to jump out the moment you login after ther servers are up, right?

Need to be the navy equivalent too
---
brb enjoying eve
---
seems moody
---
What movie is the shot from? Looks really fucking scary
---
because markets are all consuming and eventually you need people out running sites getting meta modules and isk
---
Yes, let's boost the single most used ship type current in the game so it we can get rid of all other ships.
---
Last night I was boozing with my pals and listening to Peter Frampton. Talking about recent events, trying to convince them to resub.
---
Coincidence? I think not.
---
I don't get it. You uncloak, point and web at 20km and hope you can break the tank? Why not an autocannon build?

---
&gt; Going into delve and expecting a pvp fight now or before is stupid
---
wow what a spineless attitude
---
so they should fix sigs appearing instantly for k1s and give them a delay
---
ez
---
See something creative like this would be good!
---
the "3 dOrK NaNoGanG" population that logs in once a week is pretty small because you don´t do that shit for an extended amount of time when you´re playing casually.
---
the majortiy of people comitted to that playstyle doesn´t need to buy PLEX oog because they all have high risk/high reward income sources and know where to get their money.
---
the crossover between the "3 dOrK NanOganG" and the demographic of the nullbear pingwarrior is higher than the other way around.
---
GUYS WHY CANT I JUST CONSTANTLY RAT RISK FREE GUYS
---
Good luck man, let me know how it goes, I worried about setting up in someone’s hole because they might catch on to me
---
Probably Halloween
---
Value of nullsec pve rewards will balance itself.
---
Without hundreds of bots and those who do pve in complete sefety, price for nullsec stuff will be at least x3.
---
Just curious do you speak Icelandic? Do you live there full time? Do you have family there too?
---
I unsubscribed in 2014 because the metagame was getting too boring and 0.0 was getting way too safe and there was no real challenge or danger anymore. This is exactly what I've been waiting for to resubscribe.
---
Only if the sig is off dscan. Most people mash the V key in wormhole space so the second they see some ship appear... Same thing.
---
But yeah it would be a start.
---
Why would you risk ratting in null..
---
It is not meant to be safe, you seem to think it was. For safety you’re right there is market trading.
---
Dude you need flair
---
I miss my 5 heavy Myrmiddon :(
---
Hey it's my favorite starter corp. Gotta love new players.
---
Make an alt and scam that 1b from him
---
Also interesting is broker relations/accounting  to 3 or 4 to save money if you often sell items.
---
Lol, you never know, and since you dont know, and you're too scared, other people can slide in and use the Anoms that your alliance pays the upkeep for.
---
They're a bit random. 
---
Combat related storyline missions do give better standing gains than delivery/mining ones. They can even outclass the agent level, so it's possible a L1 or L2 combat storyline gives more standing than a L4 mineral one.
---
Id say its pretty major
---
terrible comms

scooping loot
---
is brave in wh space?
---
Nah thats a cyno of some poor ass
---
If he has been in the game since beta why does he need a +5 training clone? 🤔
---
Re: Null
---
The large alliances have tons of teaching resources, and really don't care how old your character is when you use them.  They also don't particularly care if you use them for those teaching resources and then leave.  Enough people stay to make it worthwhile.
---
What do you mean by "smaller ship"?  The majority of null fleets are actually based around HACs at the moment.  Also, interdictors and interceptors are in heavy use if you want to take a small ship on a "big ship" fleet, and you will be having to operate independently from the blob if you're flying one.
---
Also, r/Eve reports only on the big fights when it comes to covering null.  There's near-constant smaller fleets organized on some smaller-than-alliance scale (corps and SIGs do it in TEST, other alliances have similar sub-alliance mechanisms).
---
As for who to join, r/Eve can't really tell you because what you value and how much is going to be widely different than other posters here.  The best suggestion I have is give it a try, and there's nobody who will be upset if you leave because you're not happy.
---
He seems moody
---
There is too much isk in game and you want to increase pve to wormholes levels? Ok maybe buff it a bit to justify wh changes... But not wh level.
---
How on earth did you read all this and think they were going to change your armor implants to shield?
---

This would be far more useful without the 80s music so you could hear the gate activations rather than remain glued watching it.

Haha, most of the nerds camping all cloaky in Delve have been Lokis.  One of the guys has got caught a few times so he treats every ratter as bait but he's still gettin' kills.

Karmafleet is in goons.

On potato mode, Eve can run multiple accounts on a high-end toaster.

So is this suddenly a change my mind for the blackout?
---
I thought I was the only person who did this.
---
I thought I saw a mining bot in high security space.
---
Its nice to see some newbies in on the action with the big boys. Brings me back to my 1st wormhole days.   
---
It just shows how diverse the game is. Its great to see. Keep up the work and you will make a great team.
---
All of that over a training pod.
---
This is one of the many reasons why now more than ever we need some kind meaningful nerf to permanent cloaking. It's absolutely great short term mechanic for combat initiation etc but makes zero gameplay sense in long term.
---
Crys in high-grade talis

All are equal before the Bob
---
Excellent comms for a nano fleet, everyone needs to talk and communicate. BUT if you are only used to anchor up press F1. You don't have any clue whats going on.
---
His player name checks out.
---
yeah you will,you will be overcome by curiosity at some point in the near future
---
I was watching a random Thanatos ratting. In an astero I couldn't do anything. However he got a faction spawn. Before his mtu could suck it up I ninjad that sucker. Yes it was only faction ammo but I linked something shiny in local. Salt commenced, glorious throwing grains over my shoulder salt as I Segwayd away.
---
I'm loving the blackout.
---
Well I hope they look more carefully in my case after I sent the second ticket. I really don't want to bother a GM on reddit if they decide against this one too.
---
nope sorry
---
Not really the question you were asking, but usually the Orca boosts aren't worth it until you have about 3 Exhumers.  You'd make more ISK/h with 2 Exhumers than whith Exhumer+Orca.
---
When sitting on a few hundred... a simple reprice can mean a lot of extra profit for me.  Glad i could fill your wallet a bit   
---
For 1B isk per system / per month I can counter this shitty intel. No problem. Mail Mar5hy in game.
---
Wrong
---
Yo wtf. His facial augmentation looks like hes in tears lmao.
---
I think it's that weird text box I sometimes fill up with v's
---
that's true, just saying I don't like his odds is all
---
Aim higher...  Like Olive garden or something. LoL
---
imagine being this out of touch
---
&gt; When you are at home you are not here for fair fight, you are at home to make isk or anniliate the attacker
---
And that's why it's important that there are game mechanics that permit small groups to achieve something, in spite of that instinct. Which is why the blackout is great (and doing something about cynos would be even better).
---
All the big ones have lots of fleets and roams.  Finding out about them will usually require you to do something more than just join the alliance.  For example, you may need to join a SIG, or a corp within the alliance that runs lots of corp fleets.
---
If you're not coming back, go RMT those accounts and get many pizzas!
---
Ahaha for real, I didnt notice. And his name checks out. This killmail is perfect lol.
---
yeah I like to call bullshit when I see it :)
---
Well they could start by being like every other game in the world and put a 20-30m afk/idle logout timer so you can’t stay logged in for 23hrs with zero activity. The fact that someone can login cloaked campers, go to work, and their 8hrs of inactivity stops an entire regions activity is complete bullshit.
---
awesome, thanks
---
I have a habit of watching/listening to 2.2-2.4x speed, so those long podcasts and pauses get way shorter. Most people talk slow anyway, I have to speed it up or I get bored out of my gourd.
---
have sex
---
Just billion isk? Gonna need more than that
---
Nano is a bit different and requires constant communication between pilots. Not anchor and F1.
---
&gt;to see some newbies in on the action with the big boys
---
Yea I think we can all say that we're proud of TDSIN
---
The only fantasies of mine that you inhabit involve a chainsaw, 6 gallons of locally gathered honey, a pitching machine loaded with vibrators, and a boom box with the Barney theme song on repeat and slightly distorted. 
---
For what that's worth.
---
facts hurt his feelings apparently!
---
Haha
---
There is another?
---
Those 100 bombers wouldn't have been in local before anyway.
---
And also has lived in c4 to c5 space
---
But then you get pvp. win-win
---
Hitting the nail on the head. Same shit the other day with the "market guy" who needed 2 paragraphs to introduce himself and underline how big he was/is and what he does. I just stop reading when a thread starts like that.

No.  It’s saying that the intended fixes from blackout stem from problems inherently present in the players behavior and ccp choosing to use blackout to address gameplay issues is lazy and desperate.
---
Looks like it. Thank you!

I run a HAM Legion... I love it.

I absolutely loved Gulnar's blops videos. Lussy Lou has some damn good videos too.
---
I'm a man of refined tastes

This is amazing.

But in all seriousness. Even if we had the dudes online, there was no way we're going back to reship because everyone had shield doctrines ready because they live in pulsars.

---
There were a lot of bot miners in highsec, until CCP introduced rorquals and basically killed any big mining operation in highsec
---
I used to stock that market.  I should drop an alt there again.  Effort...
---
We make 300-350m/hr per ship with more optimized nestors. Those fits are rather over tanked my leshasks only have 2 tank mods.
---
1b is not enough for such a contract
---
I would argue nullsec is still safer than wormholes and has a stronger economy
---
Most descriptive character name ever.
---
if you are ratting in a subcap (other than just burning off ships) you are doing it wrong.  You are basically just hoping that you make more in ticks before someone kills you.  which is probably one of the least efficient methods of making isk in the game.
---
Just understand it's not what it used to be. Most of it is kitey stuff, since you'll likely get dropped by multiple capital ships if you're in most places in sov null.
---
Indeed
---
So a 0 risk zone woud net 0 reward, got it.
---
What if someone will post about it as your salt lmao
---
Can you really doxx an amazon warehouse, though?
---
Thing is, that new guy you are talking about have never had a place in NS. Before supers and caps there were other skills. Thats why people rent space. Its just not viable to hold space like that if you are a small low SP group. That wont change with no local. You wont be able to become major sov owners now. You can perhaps sneak around a bit more but why would you. Just rent.
---
The super umbrella isnt quite the iron dome thats being regurgitated on reddit. And its been nerfed, quite recently actually, and far from what it used to be. But people are still talking about it. Neither are they really mentioning that super umbrella is really a FAX umbrella, its defensive and its main component is logistic ships.
---
No local isnt a gamebreaking mechanic. Thats the thing, it never was. If you remove it you just remove certain other things and its really not a big deal. Its a straight up lie that local worked the way people say it did, I can tell you this as a NS dweller. Its hyperbole on a level that makes someone like you, rather new to the game, think that it was super duper important. Its really not, outside of the fact that you now have no counters to certain things. If a plan to remove no local was announced and CCP had gone about a sane discussion before hand and adapted other things it could have been a balanced change. Right now its not.
---
I mean people have different opinions you know. But that little guy in the havens, hes is making isk so he can PvP later. Everyone needs a route of making isk, you have yours, I have mine and they had theirs. VNI ratting was the easiest way for a new player in null to make isk, to start building up from scratch. They didnt need ask for help or permission of others to do it, the other activities kinda require that which has its own set of problems.
---
In summary, in theory, everything can be used as solutions for Eves problems. But when you play long enough you start to realise that there really are just a couple of solutions. If you push people to hard you will lose more than you gain so even tho certain things shouldnt perhaps be in the game, the consequenses of it are so harsh that you will lose more than you gain by implementing it. 
---
Local should perhaps not be in the game, but the hit the game will take because of removing it, especially without any form of balance, will make it a pyrrhic victory. And when lesser people play, there will be lesser content and with lesser content lesser people. And I promise you, whatever else might be a problem in Eve, no solution that involves lesser players can be the solution. 
---
And CCP has had a really really shitty way of presenting and implementing ideas against the wishes of the players for quite some time now, if not always. And they are also extremely bad at reiteration. They genuinly have a bad track record for ignoring problems and doing it their way no matter input.
---
Well, it is a battle cruiser so it doesn't necessarily need to fall under the cruiser balancing umbrella.
---
they hate me for i speak the truth
---
Definitely not cost neutral.
---
&gt;terrible comms
---
I mean, if you're used to no-skill F1-monkey battle-comms bullshit then yeah, it sounds pretty terrible.
---
Nano requires communication, coordination, and (shock, horror!) actual piloting skill.
---
someone else was running a structure bash in bombers because no one ever showed up to play defense and bombers are faster than bigger ships when it comes to reffing structures with small numbers.
---
It's not about being spineless it's about how they will just drop everything on you. Going there and no expecting to get dropped on is stupid.
---
I remember when I used to rat with my SP farm character... wait...
---
It would also be funny if this person complained about citadel spam.  You know, one of the 50 structures in that system he could have parked his trainer clone at while running around ratting, or doing whatever undocked. 
---
There is an app for that, I hear.  (literally every time I blow up a trainer clone.)
---
Salt, its such a stale meme dude. Cant you think of something that hasnt been used for years. Ill give you another shot, come on. You can do it!:)
---
Good job putting words in my mouth. Here I can do it with you to:
---
GUYS WHY CANT I JUST CONSTANTLY KILL SUPERS RISK FREE GUYS
---
you are correct,  Eve should be played in complete silence. Comms are an abomination and should avoided as much as possible, and over a period of time with much trial and error near telepathic communication via intuition and muscle memory should be possible.
---
Its being critical of people who don't like the change, not goons.
---
Clearly didn't use Grammarly for that email...
---
I guess you could say it's a hairy situation..
---
Seriously, you don't know where that wig has been... and you put it on your head...
---
It might have just been someone almost as oblivious as me?
---
Of course you can. Just mentioning some things they might use
---
Would be redundant with the alt in KF.
---
Classic Elo...
---
Lol, no shit dude. But you said it, you have to have enough starting isk.
---
And you are attacking the entire thing by saying something super obvious. The rest stands on its own yet you are neglecting to mention how there is no counter to excavator bombing.
---
So feels not reals. No shit there are bots but you act like the only people who didn't play or are quiting because of this are botting. And that is factually wrong.
---
Your forgetting that an injector basically caps out. This Free SP applies 100% no matter what. I maxxed out my titan alt the last time they gave me free SP.
---
I think this would be a good addition, given the amount of monuments in game so far.
---
He's in State War Academy
---
Thats what I call the “provi special”
---
People act like every single thing they encounter is a bot if it doesn't go their way. That was the point of the first comment and the second guy just doubled down on that stance. He acts like the only real players are people who play how he does and there are 95% bots.
---
Thats gotta be it. We should make a study on it, might find interesting results.
---
praise be
---
Nah, that's a pretty common opinion amongst hi-sec miners.
---
And they were just as risk adverse as each other and dodged fighting each other. You rarely saw fleets roam into someone's space and attack a fleet formed to fight them. They would go for a soft target and then get mad that someone came to stop them. People acting like this change allowed them to fight people don't realize they could have always fought those people and chose not to.
---
Eve is a terrible spaceship game we devote our lives to. Unlike some other MMOs, PVP here is about more than just casting the best spells or swinging your blade at the right moment. PVP seeps into every aspect of the game with market manipulation, “land” grabs, spycraft, psychological warfare and more. Eve is most beautiful when game mechanics pit you against another human, and there are plenty of ways that can happen.
---
please cite the source for that.  like link the phrase in the EULA.
---
We'll wait...
---
Lol. Interesting. What do you mean by Eve is too small, population?
---
I'm saying it's bad for the game to encourage more people to super rat and that is what this change does.
---
Link the phrase in the EULA.  We'll wait.
---
Because skill point whores, I do only run +4s but it's on a 14 year old character.
---
Dude, you are straight up talking out of your ass. I have never told anyone to inject or uninstall. Are you fucking daft? Find me a single line where Ive said anything like that. And sockpuppeting, dude, you have said this so many times now without a single shred of evidence to back any of it up. If anything Im certain that you are doing this exact thing because no one can be this stupid and regurgitate lies on this level.
---
Why do you think people are downvoting your suggestions? Because they have done these activities and know you are straight up lying to further a mechanic you like. And up to a limit thats not an issue but atleast have some decency to not fking lie to new players you mongrel.
---
We have way too many ships with drone bays anyways. Especially on fleet ships. Big drag on the server in large fights but diesnt add anything meaningful, and therefore a disproportionate drag
---
Well, with the damage bonus its equivalent to 5.25 launchers where as a Typhoon or Raven has the equivalent of 7.5 launchers after its rate of fire bonus
---
I still don't understand why they're going to change the meaning of 'Slave'. Why not use 'Amulet' (rubbish name btw but whatever) for the shield ones?
---
meh
---
Whose the retard playing in a toilet bowl that won't shut the fuck up? Jesus he is whiny.
---
pith c invuln is highsec gurista 4/10
---
Anyone else here think this was an ice lake announcement?
---
Untill all shield based supercaps get hull shield hp nerf and you are back to where we started except you now have to buy an expensive implant set to get there.
---
People who asked for shield slaves are among the dumbest fucks around
---
Which one :P
---
I don't have any direct experience with their support so take this with a grain of salt but presumably if the original ticket is closed, it's fine to open a new one. Have you gone through a similar process with steam?
---
So you thought you would Karma whore. Most people saw it on the thread below that's discussing Shield slaves. Karma whoring over a cemetery monument is a whole new low.
---
That’s an interesting flattened pattern of systems up near XCBK-X. I say we try carefully planned arrangements of cynos as wells coordinated drops by industrials full of corpses and see if we can summon an abomination for content. Or maybe even BoB!
---
lol what? I see you have started to make shit up to feel correct, cute
---
Im not talking about the blob. You dont need a blob to bomb excavators. Im saying, every challenge, i.e., every hurdle must be something you can overcome. You cannot overcome certain aspects of no local. Which tells me that at the very least, no local must come with changes that allow people to not feel like they are going up against an unkillable raidboss.
---
Because that shit kills the will to play the game.
---
When they announced the changes they said pg and cpu would increased.
---
you are making shit up it's really cute
---
No, you one shot small ships
---
1:medium autocannons are bad 2: you can do that if you want to die to the first bait vni you meet, the point is that you're never at risk with this
---
Buzzard is relegated to being an afterburner fit combat probing cynobitch in a lot of situations. Not useless, but doesn't have the drone bay. No real reason to use it over a helios or astero for exploration, but the third high comes in handy for /something/
---
 You may not use your own or third-party software to modify any content  appearing within the Game environment or change how the Game is played.
---
The "I'm going to MJD them towards you" dude that doesn't listen to a fucking thing anyone says. "I'm MJDing." "MJD this". Christ.
---
I think they got the photos backwards for the last one. The jammer one is wrong too because we dont live under jammers. Rorq one is wrong because we do more mining then eve and can save our ships where others cant. I think that is enough flaws pointed out on this photo
---
My interpretation of this makes the twitch crap bannable, but CCP's interpretation is probably different.
---
lol.  EVERY person who streams Eve can tell you that this has been covered in detail with CCP.  good luck getting that petition through.  what a waste of time.
---
To be fair, if all this transpired as you say and nothing happens after the second ticket, there's no point in not bothering a GM on here. You'd be getting screwed either way so they would have earned being bothered v0v good luck
---
Kinda like scene where Gordon’s kid asks why the cops chase Batman.
---
weird flex but ok
---
That's a very niche application.

CACKLED!

I would test his bank account. He is challenging the resolve of someone that can die in a t1 frigate and cost him 1bil each time I die. I would do it all day everyday till it stops. I would farm the shit out of it till he is a broke as bitch
---
But it was such a great year!
---
Well considering what you replied to one can easily make assumptions. You claimed that guy has no idea how many boys there are, and he was saying how people act like everything they encounter is a bot. One can assume you are saying yes most things people encounter are bots.
---
My implication is you are ignorant and would rather attribute everything to bots than actually consider people don't follow a pvp life style.
---
No extreme jumps of logic here.
---
Any fit for a true hunter-killer T3? Covops, probe-capable, can tackle and brawl.
---
&gt;that doesn't listen to a fucking thing anyone says
---
That's actually a corp rule. Whatever markj2 wants, markj2 gets. For good reason
---
Oh so you didn't say the first person was wrong? There aren't bots everywhere?
---
Out of curiosity, what percentage of your comments are just “meh?”
---
Hey you are probably right, but doesn't mean I won't try and fight it.  This becoming NEAR3 or something similar just hurts the game.
---
then the blackout came... and the botters all came back to high sec to mine.
---
Shameless plug lol
---
Nah, T3C heavy bomber. Drops 1 extremely large exp radius bomb. Would at least cut down on Titan death balls with no support being unstoppable. 
---
That being said, the DD was meant to scrub fleets of scrubs. I don't think it needs a change any time soon.
---
does your brain work okay?
---
You can change as many laws as you wish but any lawmaker will understand that if its not enforcable then it becomes meaningless. There are laws that say women should wear skirts that cover 2 inches below the knees. Is anyone enforcing it? No, its a stupid law that doesnt make sense.
---
So any law that is to be implemented needs to actually make sense in order for people to adapt to it. If it doesnt the law will have unintended consequences that destabilize the authority of the lawmaker. And the login numbers are showing these unintended consequences, albeit way to soon to say anything definitive, still a way to large of a drop to attribute to randomness. 
---
Laws have to be just and somewhat fair, onesided regulations tend to create more issues that it solves.
---
Because he'd cry if he doesn't get it? Makes sense, if I had to listen to some dude with his head in a loo cry, I think I'd go enjoy "the outside" for a bit.
---
I'm saying it's good for the game that more ratters will die (even in supers) and that's what this change does
---
he most definitely won't enjoy Eve this way lmao
---
Sansha has a thing for slaves
---
almost all of null looks like that, its fucking crazy    
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/The_Citadel#npc24 This is highsec btw
---
Sure, but it's damage locked and still a lesser damage platform.  The BS also can fly substantial drone flights on top of that.  By contrast, a VNI gets the full damage bonus profile of a Dominix.
---
I'm ignorant cause I know there's bots everywhere. Ok good talk.  You have some screws loose haha
---
how much isk for that fit?
---
Or I didn't read or even see that thread?  Don't jump to conclusions.
---
Ohhh.....
---
Ohhhhhhh.....
---
No, the name will change
---
Lol shhhhh dont ruin the narrative. I subbed about a month before this. The community is just getting too toxic.
---
&gt; The elitist mentality that has become rife since the blackout
---
good one
---
I'm more surprised nobody posted about the vni changes hitting sisi
---
5d chess move right there
---
Playing since beta and salty about a 500mil pod. It’s not trolling if it makes him look like an idiot.
---
&gt;Because he'd cry if he doesn't get it
---
You must be new to high class if you don't understand why MCAV lets mark do just about any insane play he wants to go for
---
If you can't manage to train all frigates to 5 I don't have any help for you. I don't know a single person who regularly flies bombers (and I know a fair amount) who doesn't have each frigate skill trained to 5 and doesn't have the means to keep all 4 bombers fit and handy.
---
Saying a bombers are damaged locked doesn't change the fact that bombers have the equivalent of 5.25 launchers.
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
Always a good time when your fanclub sends you updates to your EDC.
---
It's only been a few years since folks would do fun roams in like 30 talwars, get a few kills and have a ton of fun. 
---
As far as inflation goes, I blame the proliferation of ratter carriers, and VNI bot farms. I miss when carriers were still somewhat impressive, instead of just another ship flown by some brain-dead newbro. Newbro's in caps still feels very wrong to me. Roaming through BRAVE space this weekend a carrier off a Keepstar sent out fighters to try and catch me and my buddy in Retri's a few hundred kilometers out. He seemed to missclick at some point and while his fighters loitered off the KS he jumped out of system. Everything about the situation was really disappointing to me. Years ago I went to BRAVE systems when I wanted to have a brawl and see how much I could kill before they mobbed me down with t1 subcaps. Now they're the same as any other bullshit nullsec group, they just haven't realized it yet.
---
I'm going to go for "things that didn't happen" for 500 please.
---
😞 I wish it was less I really do
---
Pilgrim can still pump 40k+ EHP and fit two neuts, cloak and cyno as well as hard tackle. It's not as good as the old 120k ehp cloaky proteus with 15km scram but it's at least something, and can hold down a vni until backup shows.
---
Anything with a cyno and a carrier alt
---
Lol you may have explained what you THINK is the solution, but your wrong. 30 seconds after landing is the usual align time for carriers. That's quite a bit of time to realign and that isnt even including the deceleration time.
---
No one uses them anymore. And if they change local it will kill Eve. Didn't you hear?
---
I get involved in a lot of SB fleets but I can't see how the immunity would make sense.  Bombers are fairly fragile and fleets need to accept the risk of superweapons and fly enough bombers across the grid (or bait) to absorb the losses.
---
What is Querious Fight Club?
---
Hahaha, pussy
---
Gotta kill that guy. Sounds like a goood way to get content delivered to your doorstep.
---
I'd sure never cross a main with a head of hair like his.
---
The goon cloaky camp has been doing damage, but all I recall init ships doing in Horde space is exploding quickly. I suppose there might be one or two init guys with the goons as eyes or something, but they don't seem to be on many kills.
---
You are ignorant because you have no idea how many bots there actually are and claim anyone who disagrees is ignorant.
---
CHANNEL ZARVOX
---
Yep, how about yours?
---
Bad bot
---
Are you sure about that? Because I am 99.78047% sure that Lorenzo_Maulerant is not a bot.

Oh no. I've been in high class since 2012. Just never actually heard his whining in person. I've experienced the fool he makes of himself in local chat, in person, first hand however. I'm surprised anyone listens to him at this point.
---
T3B, complete with SP loss.  Polarised would be a gamble...
---
But you don't care that it encourages more people to consolidate under null blocs and discourages anyone without a super from pveing?
---
good bot
---
Awesome, I always like to hear of my fellow EVE Traders cashing in.   Bravo
---
I'm sorry. Carriers have roughly 35 seconds where they are in danger of being tackled provided everything else on the hunters side goes perfectly. I hope you can sense the eyes rolling.
---
cringy,
---
Typical vass being the saltiest idiot in eve again. Nothing to see here folks.
---
I am playing since 2009, i am crabbin very rarely and make isk mostly with plexing. I have a lot more Fun now and will plex more, due to losses and trying new stuff. So, i dont leave and seed real Money into the game. The 30 Rorqual Dude who wasnt even Content for anyone but Bombersbar and not giving Money to CCP leaves.  Who would you care more about as a company and as a Player seeking content? 
---
Yes there is a point where if no crabs existed anymore would be bad for the ingame Economy too, but we are lightyears away from it. Those players  with their n-rorqual Mining/Netflixing are damaging to the Game right now. Good they leave.
---
Eh, well those articles he linked say how many bots they banned. So... it looks like he does knot how many bots there are (or at least the order of magnitude of the botting problem).   
---
I don't ever understand people 'defending' botters, or saying there is no botting problem. If you're right, then what do you care about some folk jabbering on about a non-issue?
---
69
---
Granted you now how C1 level ratting ticks but you also get C1 site respawn times ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
That was a different person who linked those. And it's not defending botters its point out how stupid it is to assume anyone who is opposed to this change is a botter.
---
So umm, how do you dscan my cloakie loki?
---
I, for one, enjoyed it.
---
Ehhh. But he skips the solo dreadnought.
---
I think is fit is cyno bait/buffer for deagressing and docking if he gets in over his head. Although im confused by OP saying he was on station but he dropped tether, so if he was on a citadel I would say the fit is.. uh interesting unless hes suppose to last till triage lands, drop bastion and get repped. Idk fit could be okay for what hes doing, but I would have some slight tweaks for sure
---
And to you and the guy above you, IF I remember correctly, two faction plates, rep rigs, and HG assclaps you wont really over rep but it is pretty damn close
---
No visual is friendly with cockroach and hostile to panfam. Hence their taking panfam sov in Vale. The ER groups are all panfam aligned, not independent or their own coalition.
---
I am torn.
---
I hope it’s permeant and extends to lowsec.
---
true true, and the miracle of the solo pali, also a mad lad move.
---
Wormhole PVE rewards are acceptable because each individual needs their own farmhole, with dedicated alts that cannot be saved if tackled. The alternative is static farming, which is awful income if you actually roll.
---
If you want wormhole PVE you should also get one site spawn a day per constellation, and pve ships that are extremely vulnerable with no safety net.
---
calm down miner
---
Yeah, no,  the way MCAV did it was better overall. Dual leshaks —&gt; dreads easy money.
---
what if we stop creating obtuse exceptions in a game littered with them already?
---
Where you hunting before Blackout? It was a joke mostly. Thanks to Near2 and local Intel most docked up before you materialized. There was mostly none to shoot.....
---
Go catch some bots.
---
Obviously, I'm not. Next stupid question?
---
hahahaha please by all mean, could you add some more salt in those tears... i like my NS carebear tears to be saltier.
---
Bitch please, there's far worse people than me out there. But I must've gotten to you at somepoint because you remember me. Shucks.
---
Thanks! I appreciate the corrections, I'll probably try and do a video separately that compiles the mistakes I made here. Always going to be a few, especially now EVE Skunk is dead and you can't snoop on people's standings, which was an excellent tool for this.
---
Yeah you're right, I'm probably just being too optimistic
---
Not at all. I was able to kick out the hacker from my steam account quickly since I was actively using it unlike my eve accounts. After that I set up a 2FA on my steam. I had no idea that they were messing around with my eve stuff and no clue how they got into my alt since I used a different password for it and that it was an actual eve account instead of steam. Also how will knowing the ip address help me? I'm asking so I know how to word it in the ticket and not because I don't believe you.
---
I'm not exactly disagreeing on principle.
---
Farm available per region should still be reduced.
---
Only we can talk about buffing isk/hr.
---
Well, go on. Make the argument. What makes the HAM legion better than a HAM loki?
---
As if CCP spend money on marketing.
---
To be fair, the blackout stuff really makes me want to come back.
---
what an app champ.
---
sons of luminaire and later on aideron robotics splitting happened.
---
Yeah. A single region shouldn't be able to sustain thousands of players.
---

---
Revive your old account AND start a new one if you don’t like your old account’s name. You can even use the same email and you can train skills on one character on each account at the same time.
---
Hey I'll kill your Helios and send you 500m from the payout, deal?
---
If you won't take it, dibs.
---
Part of the master plan. We boycott knowing we would get free sp at the end. Sorry you couldn't see the 4D chest game.
---
You had to actually work for a kill by doing recon and baiting. Seriously it's beyond easy to dunk supers and rorqs. Now you won't have as many players mining or ratting, no more dunking rorqs and supers daily. So where is all this the content going to come from? And what is going to fund it?
---
How is it possible to be that experienced and make the one cardinal fault in EVE: give the guy who blew up your pod your tears? Did they not get the memo?
---
Dumb call by Major Moody.
---
Lol your also forgetting deceleration time. You haven't killed very many carriers it sounds like.
---
One hunnit
---
For sure, I’ve been running a weird data/combat/pvp Vexor and the fit was a fucking mess. I’ve streamlined it to just combat sites and had much more efficient clears, still got fucked and had to warp out of the last room of a 5 DED but we gave it a shot. 
---
I’m still getting the hang of Lowsec and accidentally ended up in Amarr FW space but we didn’t die so that’s a plus.
---
Why? I like suicide!
---
*mic cuts in and out due to sheer rage distortion *
---
It is, why people started defending themselves. Isnt the point of the game that we choose ourselves? The umbrella isnt made out of NPCs, its players themselves. Its not illegal to fight back yet its somehow become a bad thing if we do. If someone enters your home with a gun and you have a bigger gun, you wouldnt use it?
---
NS has been buffed, against the wishes of many NS people, same people who are now saying they dont want no local. They were ignored then and they are being ignored now. Maybe if we had listened we wouldnt be in this position today? And if we ignore them today we will perhaps be in another bad place tomorrow?
---
Also, the last 6 months have been nothing but nerfs mind you. People conveniently forget this, as if no local is just one nerf to NS. Its not even a nerf in that sense, its a fundamental change in core mechanics. Nerf away, but dont change core mechanics as a substitute for poor balance. It would be like removing Concord in HS, too much of a change.
---
Ye thats true. Poor wording, I dont mind it in that sense, I just dont belive in it if you understand what Im saying. I belive it will do quite the opposite of its intention which fozzie sov, rorqs, cynojammers and so on did. Sounds reasonable in theory but in practice will only hurt more than the gains. But outside of a discussion, ingame, it wont affect me enough. But it will others.
---
Dude, this account is new. Cause I keep forgetting the passwords. But I, like many other NS dwellers have been supervocal about those buffs. Because at the end of the day, we are the first ones to experience their issues. If we have a supercap umbrella, so will everyone else. If we have rorqs, so will everyone else. It becomes a zero sum game and the last couple of years everyone has had to work superhard to ensure that they dont fall behind in the arms race. Its made the game into a job and burnt me personally out a couple of times (gamewise). The CSM, which mainly consists of NS people, told CCP right away that Rorquals that started this entire meta is a bad idea. CCP didnt listen, but yet everyone is sitting here today saying that we wanted to be engulfed in this shitty "mine more or we will get overrun" meta so CCP could get their titans online.
---
Oh I get that its a different feeling, I get it 2. Its actually quite enjoyable. For a while. After that its gonna start to wear people down. No one will handle that level of tension well over time and trust me, its far worse for people having to do high isk stuff, like moving minerals worth billions in a system where they can get fked at any time. Which is why many opt out of living in wormholes (well myriad of reasons).
---
One thing people are missing is the fact that in the end people wanna have fun/chill when they play a game. They dont wanna sit there becoming increasingly more paranoid. I mean whats the point then? So a game thats been feeling like work the last couple of years just became even more more work. There will be a tipping point when people just start feeling "naa, not for me anymore". 
---
Would also like to add, we are the biggest PvPers in the game, not the small gang people you hear bitching on this forum. We create and fight the wars that people read about and at any given day we run hundreds of fleets for content, for war for whatever. And as I said, the issues hit us harder than the small gang which is why weve been vocal about them. These people who complain are mostly  "elite" which is the meme, they want to be able to roam into our homes, kill our shit then leave. They are pissy that we dont let them, or rather that we fight back.
---
Now does that playstyle have issues? Sure do, they need help. But they need a revamp of LS, not one of NS. They should be able to find content in LS, not bitch about megaalliances defending their turf. And that isnt something we can help them with, local or not. And they will start bitching very soon about other stuff, just wait and see. In the end, CCP has to actually fix the broken parts of the game, not just announce a "kill NS" event to make people forget about the real issues for a week or 2.

I love no local. No local forever. The game is better and feels more dangerous.  All you candy ass miners can go to hi sec.

he said "in this game" not "to this game" they mean two different things.
---
400+ members and you got 8 for PVP... What a shit show
---
I couldn’t relate more to a comment on this sub.
---
Probably because I don’t know what other comments mean.
---
BAD, hurt's players.
---
When will people learn, these changes hurt players not bot's, the bot operator gives zero fucks about what drones his bot uses, or what hull his bot uses or how long it takes, all he's thinking about is when I goto bed and start my bot, how much extra isk will I have in the morning, and as long as that number is not zero its worth while for him to bot.
---
CCP needs to stop fucking over players and come up with an out of game detection system to catch and ban human behind the bot and not just the account he was using to bot with.

**We do consider overlays using elements of a second or multiple other EVE clients to be against the rules.** It changes the way the game is played and grants the player unfair advantages over other players. **For example, having overviews from other EVE clients as overlays on one EVE client would allow a player to get real time intel from all those other game instances without having to switch to the other windows.** Similarly, overlays using elements from a second or multiple other EVE clients to allow the player to activate modules etc. on those other game instances without switching to the other client windows are clearly in violation of our rules.

Shouldn't change that much. All the Bot consume one plex a month, doesn't matter where it comes from. By buying from the market, they keep the prices up and encourage more players to buy plex to sell them.
---
If the would suddenly ban all bots, the plex prices might plummet and less would sell them to get ISK.
---
In the end, CCP gets paid for the botters, be it directly or indirectly.

What about newbies starting in hisec, getting sick of the game and leaving?

Yet you provide no counter argument just childish insults. It's hilarious that an allegedly grown man continues to reduce himself to petty insults, telling me to kill myself like I'm supposed to give a shit. Mate, that shit stops working in school. 
---
Let me sum it up for the simple minded. Plexers are not as valuable as paying customers, you can't take last year's balance sheet to your investors and expect them to give a shit. Unless people are buying fresh plex and/or subbing, they aren't making money. The fact plex is on a downward trajectory after the blackout is a pretty decent indicator that people are opting to sub and plex, therefore ccp is making more money. 
---
Where's the incentive to appeal to those players? They create a demand yes, but if shit hits the fan that demand can just be faked, it's a video game, not a real world functioning economy.

BTW you should probably lay off the stimulants for a while bro, you're gonna give yourself an aneurysm if you keep having these temper tantrums

HK has tried to poach him off us many times. Be happy that failed I guess!

Lol, you are pushing a narrative which suits your agenda. And its based on so much wrongs its not even fun, its just sad.
---
They didnt leave the game because of people defending their homes, they left because CCP neglected alot of other aspects. Same aspects mind you that still are being neglected. No local will long term do exactly jack shit to keep players in, no matter how hyped people are today. 
---
For years the same "carebears" were telling CCP that its too much. Dont blame us for CCP wanting titans online so they could market the game. We did exactly what they asked. 
---
I dont know if they really did that, its become a meme on its own and I personally didnt do it so I dont give a shit about adapt or die. And in fact, how I remember it was regarding alliances and not individuals so its a bit meh.
---
Sure, everyone NS has threaten to unsub. Or even en masse. But sure, I promise you tho, before all of this is over, the very same guys, you included, will beg for things to go back. When the hype settles and you start to realise that nothing really  has changed, youre gonna be sitting here posting about how shitty Eve has become and bla bla bla. Just remember that we are telling you that this wont fix anything and it will be a netloss rather than gain.
---
Ohhh people in NS are all bots or semibots, they arent "elite". Dude, meme much? Like do you have to act retarded? Have to be a 2 year old?
---
This is very true because commands just cannot be relayed through chat effectively or fast enough.  However for like the big nullsec blocs a lot of things arent that complicated that you need to do.  Most of the commands are either typed into fleet chat or broadcast through the fleet window itself. So while you might not be able to get into some more of the small gang PvP with the more elite groups you can still make a good life with like Test Alliance, Brave, Goonswarm or Pandemic Horde.
---
People will go on PvP roams with those groups and you can explain your situation and most of the time they can accommodate.
---
imagine being upset at losing a +5 pod if you've been in the game since beta
---
you truly are an idiot
---
evidently your brain does not work properly. try reading everything and this time use comprehension and dont add your own thoughts
---
lol you are fucking stupid its hilarious
---
Hmmm, true that's an option but usually you don't need a combatscanner when you use a Cyno since allmost everywhing you drop on with a Cyno sits inside a site.
---
In Delve we have shittons of Prospects for that since they have a very good signature tank and argueably function better as Cloaky Cyno bitches. Its usually a Prospect if you get dropped while sitting in a belt or site - just look at the guy who lost his Vendetta, he just lost another ship and guess whats on the [killmail](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77866588/)! 
---
Sure I guess for that specific case where you need a Combat Scanner and a Cyno its really cool fitting a Buzzard... but imo you can't combine Cyno dropps with Combat probing...
---
Combat probing is either for WH space to get them inside sites or simply to actively engage targets you can fight, like scanning someone with a Hecate and fighting him.
---
But in null you can simply d.scan sites wich takes less time and is also less obnoxious than having Combat Probes on your overview, its also way more subtle.
---
So those Areas where you need a Combat Scanner are those where you usually can't use a Cyno.
---
ya, Sector
---
Need a dildo monument for Delve.
---
Sadly you can fake activity. Make the cloaking limited instead. For example use capacitor at a certain rate that would allow the cloak to work until the capacitor is empty, or a certain time has passed. I always find it strange how there is no cost associated with keeping your ship cloaked.
---
Perhaps blackout makes 🦀 rage even about the small losses..
---
I disagree that that will happen. Your premise is only correct if there are a bunch of people out there who don't want to rat in a super but will if the risk is...higher? Doesn't make sense.
---
[https://sov.space/](https://sov.space/)
---
Suppose this:
---
C is also at was with D. But A is not at war with D. 
---
Midway through a fight involving A, B, and C, D rocks up hoping to score easy kills. A is repping C, who are being shot at by B. 
---
D shoots C.
---
Now A is neutral third party to the C-D war. Concordokken happens. 
---
So what if the system allowed allowed cross-war reps if the parties shared _at least one_ war together? You get neutral reps again, that's what you get. 
---
C puts their logistics into the CLogi corp. Both C and CLogi declare war against CAlts. 
---
Boom. Neutral reps again.
---
The more complicated ratting gets the more advantageous Botting is btw.
---
Can anyone tell me what happened to Snuff Box?

I enjoyed reading this. Nice to see groups try new things. Come back to Delve anytime! UEXO-Z is a pretty dead area of Delve. This might help: [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Delve/UEXO-Z#npc24](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Delve/UEXO-Z#npc24)
---
No logic here please. And no blasphemy either, no local is our saviour, it will totally fix every underlying issue this game has had for years. And what we are seeing atm, the uptick in violence, has nothing to do with inital hype which will last a week or so before everybody realise nothing has really changed. More than everything becoming more expensive.
---
&gt;Just wish, everyone wasnt bashing each others sides.
---
Woah woah woah, this is /r/eve I'm gonna need you to call someone a nasty name or get out.
---
A lot of this has to do with the fact small gang was nerfed for years, and a play style that many veteran players who didn't have to F1 monkey enjoyed was wiped from the game. Excuse me while I and many others who have been shit on by /r/eve and CCP enjoy a change that benefits us for once. Obligatory Adapt or die, HTFU.
---
This made me chuckle
---
Keep telling people, no logic here please. People will 100% keep doing what they used to, content will be more after even because carebears are subhuman and cannot calculate risk to reward ratios. More will want to lose stuff, not less!
---
You get thats bots right? I saw these as well and if I wanted to kill them it would have taken me 5 minutes to do so. Just logoff. Real players afk, bots dont.
---
It's... Security.
---
I believe that the interpretation on this is that we can't use program or overlays to *play* multiple clients on one screen.  That is not what is happening.  He has eight full clients open and switches between the accounts to report intel.  What you are *seeing* are OBS overlays, but they are not how he interacts with the game.  In fact, it is not possible to interact with the client in any way through OBS.  
---
Also, I think that, legally, words mean things.  "Real time" means something.  This is not real time.  Add in the time that it would take a viewer to see it on screen, report it, and someone else to see that report.  That intel is certainly not received in real time, by any definition.
---
Back before he started streaming this intel, he streamed daily with multiple clients showing on one screen with the use of OBS overlays.  But that isn't the layout that he plays on; he has multiple clients open.  Employees of CCP have viewed that stream several times and never said a word about it.  So, the overlays aren't the issue.  The only thing that would be an issue is the unfair advantage.  As I said elsewhere here, if that is a problem, nearly all major FCs in the game are about to be banned as well because they have all run intel streams at one point or another.
---
And, regardless of what you think about this particular intel stream, I can assure you that his stream has been used FAR MORE often to gain an unfair advantage *against* him, than any advantage that it may be giving to anyone right now.
---
Also, this is not a bug. A bug is "this doesn't meet specifications".
---
Your post is "the specifications are shit". An important distinction because the engineers look at bugs. Gameplay people write and re-write specifications.
---
Your EBR will end up being closed.
---
I take that as a no....
---
Baiting and recon... Srsly? Super ratting are always aligned and only vulnerable when just landing on site. And ther e was no baiting, just sheer luck that no one reported that Gang on Intel, or the Super Pilot missed the unscanned Sig. If the Super Pilot took care, he is perfectly save with Perfect local Intel....
---
And how do you bait the Rorqual Pilot out of the Umbrella... I am curious. Using a spy in Alliance to tell him you know a Place where all Ochre is mined already and only the Juicy stuff  waiting?..
---
I am outta here
---
This is the great migrations of krabs from nullspace to highsec trig invasions til local is restored.
---
its about time.
---
Everyone is entitled to an opinion.
---
Yeah, they will be more inclined to, unless they stop ratting altogether. The choices are, be in a big ship that could be saved, or accept you're gonna lose some ships. The drive to rat isn't based on how risky it is to rat, it's based on wanting money. The big difference now is, subcap ratting has become substantially more risky than capital ratting, so naturally the Krabs are gonna flock to the least risky activity, which involves a cyno and a bunch of supers.
---
And I DO agree with you that people don't want to risk their supers, but also they don't want to risk anything at all. So when you have a better chance of being isk positive in a capital (and getting saved) versus just losing more subs, it makes capitals a lot more attractive for making money.

Less players during blackout = less bots.

It was super last minute and not everyone could fly Steath Bombers. We also spread over every time zone. Had 35 online at the time and only a few where near staging at time with ship and skills.

That's actually kinda cool. At least it wasn't a fart bomb.

In case anyone wasn't aware that intel streams are a thing, just look at how many there are right now:

this is the impression I get every time alts get brought up.  Everyone's always like "you need 2-3 alts, at least).

CCP might not, Pearl Abyss probably does...

I would be scared, he is probably a Navy Seal

&gt;And that's why it's important that there are game mechanics that permit small groups to achieve something,

Good on them for padding login numbers whilst evaluating if a change has lowered said login numbers?

I dont disagree one bit about the event or its importance to new players. Its great for them. Im just questioning the timing of it. It makes it supereasy for them to say, hey guys numbers are up no local is a success.

You never taint data like this if you want to be taken seriously.

You should make the Rogue Drone Strain Mother things, printer would probably have trouble on the tentacle parts though.

Always been curious how tf CCP would know if you were using a Frankenclient or if anyone has actually been banned for it
---
Welcome to a month ago i guess.

This game is def relaxing. So do what you find is relaxing, join a highsec mining corp not a null/lowsec one.
---
At 300m isk/hr in a super it takes 40 hours to repay the hull. 50-60 hours to repay the full fit. A VNI takes 2 hours to repay. Most people will do the math - as they do today. If people aren't inclined to super rat today, making super ratting riskier isn't likely to make them more inclined because they are gonna lose some VNIs.

God I'm just imaging the pure physical euphoria I would experience from sitting on that
---
It's against the rules, if CCP decides to not enforce it, that's their decision, I honestly don't care. I'm just informing people that it is against the rules, after that point they can make their own decisions. I stopped using OnTopReplica when they changed the rules, which at the time, was believed to be the target of the rule change.
---
it's the channel, where you write gf^every 5 years^when there is no capital drop^because you brought more than 1 velator
---
People dislike the change because for one, certain things lack counters. Its not a game about skill and knowledge anymore but rather luck. Thats atleast my biggest issue with it. Also it will just make shit even more stale with smaller groups taking the largest hit, as per usual. It will be counterproductive, one just has to think about its ramifications for more than 2 minutes.
---
But the event, sure the timing feels very much like a last resort so save a shitty change, but the free SP is needed. Newer players need to have it easier to get into the game. Hope you come back tho.
---
But we lost 10% drone damage... And I skilled all into drones because I enjoy using them, only for ccp to say fk you to my sp
---
I'm saying it's too low under the proposed idea that this man is so influential he would have people that he could trust to pursue such a contract.

If he was really that important, I think 20b would be more practical to not be disrespectful to his supposedly powerful hunter friends.
---
OnTopReplica...
---
Not even close to the same thing.  Like... did you even read.  He plays on full multiple clients on multiple screens.  He just...  forget it.  Whatever.  You have no idea what you're even talking about.

Oh but a difference in chosen words, jargon, phrasing, lingo, vocab, wordage, nomenclature or locution is not related about ones knowledge on a certain subject, is it? People can think what they want.... let them think... let them think... ;)

That is something that pisses me off about EVE, people know you logged in, where you are, and if they decide to actually commit to that stupidity, there is very little a lone gamer can do.

It defeats the idea of a space game.

Yes, I do. It captures a region of another client and puts it to the forefront of a window, it's exactly what he's doing, but with OBS. He's capturing a small part of another window (the gate) on multiple clients, and putting them on the same screen (in this case, it's OBS). His OBS still contains an overlay of all the other parts of the screen, even if he isn't placing them over top of his eve client. The intel still exists for him on OBS with no delay, though he likely minimizes the screen and streams it instead of looking at it.
---
It's...

I mean, I don't trust anyone ingame, especially my alts, they are a bunch of awoxers.
---
yes, if you MCT on your main account, each of those three characters remain omega.  so you can train skill and not lose their use.  
---
if you start up a new character, you have to keep subbing indefinitely to maintain skills.
---
I never said I wanted risk free you. Just like you never said you wanted to kill supers risk free.
---
I am saying people will be forced to move into supers because the risk vs reward in anything smaller than a super is not worth it now.

Head to wherever TAPI currently are, home or staging or just a semi decent fleet tbh, and let the sperg in the local chat window wash over you, do this once a day for a week, until it has corrupted your soul, then return to this sub - it will be like you were blind but can now see.

You are saying I am stupid but have no idea what changed recently or are being intentionally ignorant. Pretty sure you are the idiot here.
---
I have read every word. You jumped to "WHY ARE YOU SO STUPID" when you gave up reading.
---
Is there a good video on how to use D-Scan? I've read the Eve University bit and looked at some of the resources here, but I either haven't figured it out or it's using what looks like an old UI for the game.
---
I have shared mine openly with the EVE Community... They never took action against me..
---
If he ever needs tips, I could help ;)
---
Here is the difference that you just don't seem to understand.
---
EVEN IF.... he overlays all this stuff onto OBS and only looks at OBS... he can't interact with it in any way.  He would still have to tab to that particular client before being able to act on anything that he saw while looking at OBS.  The whole point of CCP talking about overlays at all is that it allows people to never have to tab to another client.  *That* is the unfair advantage that the overlays provide.  In this case, the advantage isn't present.
---
The only case for an unfair advantage is that other players can watch the stream and get... let's say *near* real time intel.  And again, there are no less than 5 intel streams up at any given time.  CCP has had plenty of time to say that intel streams are an exploit and they haven't.   ...yet.
---
&gt; The fact that bridges can also be defended with unstoppable DDs if they are on grid with a keepstar isn't exactly great either.
---
That strikes me as something that's significantly more fixable than the others.  You can't anchor one of them in DD range of a fixed gate, can you?
---
(On the sillier end, I suddenly want a way to force ACLed JBs to let me through, if I'm willing to sit on grid with them for some time, either by shooting them or anchoring some sort of interference device.)
---
bad bot
---
I bolded the part that talks about getting intel from the captured region (ie he can see someone taking the gate), the part after that deals with interacting with the client through the captured region. Both are against the rules, I think you misread it.
---
This is something that I've been championing for many years (since 2007 in fact, when Veto, my former Corporation lost one of our members, DarkElf) and a couple of the amazing guys from the art team took on the concept work for it earlier this year.

We often get requests from corps, alliances and individuals to put monuments or tributes into the game environment for specific people, but we'd rather keep a level playing field and have a single site that's dedicated to everyone loved and lost.

I gave the art team the name "The Eternal Cyno" and this is what they came up with - it looks even better at full res with all the effects running and stuff.
---
There's a LOT of people within CCP who've since added touches and suggestions to it, and it's looking amazing so far.

I'm a little sad that it's made it's way to SiSi's file structure already, as I was hoping to keep it for the opening ceremony in Berlin, but it's good that it's being received positively.

The intention with this asset is to eventually replace the control tower that's currently anchored in Molea, with the same mechanic that prevents decay of anchored cans around it so that people can leave messages and tributes if they want to do so.

It still needs a lot of GFX work, along with a few other things including a description that I'm finding pretty difficult to write. Sometimes it's tough to find words.
---
Hopefully it'll be in game on TQ before the end of the year :)
