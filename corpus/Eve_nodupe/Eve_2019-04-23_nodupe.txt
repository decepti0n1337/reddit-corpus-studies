Fair enough, I think I'm not good enough at solo pvp yet for it to feel op instead of just fun haha xD
---
Here's a little secret about being outside of a null circle.. ready?? everyones a resource, except TEST no one cares for them.
---
&gt;ec-300's
---

---
Totally deserved it.
---
I always upvote west wing references
---
I fought in Immensea today, does that count?
---
Goddamnit, these videos are great.
---
one that you will be blue with... lol
---
Oh, I thought it would be members of the Fountain Feeder Federation doing what they do best.
---
 "We break for Rorquals"  gets the upvote.
---
Macharials and no heavy web support, fuckinG REEEEEEEEEEE.
---
&gt;while knowing that everyone in local is friendly to you.
---
you don't need to know people in local are friendly to you because unless they're negative sec status the chance of you getting successfully ganked by them if you have a brain is less than getting awoxed in null
---
6 seconds?
---
wew
---
i am actually more perplexed on how i never seen this pun before
---
eve can run on a toaster that's not plugged in so I would look to see what other games you occasionally want to play now or in the future and build around that
---

---
A wild BjornBee appears.
---
Back then you had to figure out stuff your own as well or rely on corp mates, because the (awesome) guides did not yet exist.  
---
The demographic also was a bit different back then I guess (I would really like to know how that changed over the years)
---
o7
---
Looks like I’m wrong.

---
It takes nearly 7 days to build an Astrahus (assuming 600,000 seconds base).
---
Some people would be smart and research the BPO a little first, but not much.  The first few levels of TE are quick, and make a difference.  Additional levels not so much.
---
There would also be variability in skills and implants.
---
Then the variability of anchor now, or wait for downtime.
---
Also time to travel N jumps, or anchor in the current system.
---
Then just drop it wherever, or try to make a good bookmark for the location first.
---
Then to figure-out how to anchor.  Even though I did it on SiSi, it was still confusing for me the first time I tried it on TQ.
---
I imagine there were a lot of them anchored on the very same day, but doubt many at the same moment.  Someone was probably first.
---
no, you're dumb. 
---
This is the CCP one that was "under construction" for a week or so, it was slowly built and the model changed each did. Did you even look at the pic lol that that look like a completely built astrahus
---
Yep. It's boring, and it means you don't get these 20-30 man derp corps that are 100% guaranteed to give you a fight very often.
---
Good thing that moon chunks, ore anomalies and asteroids are infinite.... :P
---
pretty sure it's shared cache these days. but if you're doing this, you should know how to use task manager at least to get running command lines.
---
Now THIS is shitposting. POTY/10 made me laugh
---
Might seem dumb, but little things like this is why I like EvE.
---

---
Kill the slaves. It's a lot easier
---
Thanks
---
Shhh, they're all circle jerking about how incredibly difficult and time consuming it is to build a computer.
---
Next thing they'll talk about it how you need to spend at least $2000 for a good computer.
---
I would like to know more...
---
Nobody gave a shit about your rant on the EvE-O forum. Did you really think it would go better here?
---
I would tell you to get checked out but that ship seems to have sailed long ago.
---
Bye! EvE isn't the casual themepark you were looking for.
---
Maybe try Star Citizen when it releases in 2063.
---
Two titans who tried to boson t1 dessies and die. Or the dessies killing the titan without the dreadbomb. Just two things that came to my mind
---
Beware, Thrice!  I have fireworks, and I'm not afraid to use them!
---
Bullshit. 20 bucks my ass.
---
Of course now you're gonna be like "*heh make a parts list then loser xD*", but I'm not going to waste my time doing so just to illustrate your idiocy.
---
Common sense, irrespective of any further research, will tell you that build-it-for-you companies make more than 20 bucks a machine, considering how well they all flourish.
---
They still feel new to me. History?!
---
The percentage has barely gone up. Hilmar’s AMA has the most recent numbers, there’s an average of roughly 1.6 accounts per human. This is in line with the previous released numbers, back in 2015, of roughly 1.5 accounts per human.
---
I did force the client to use the Nvidia GPU, as the updater is non-graphical, and it would cause the the client to run on the built-in Intel GPU instead.
---
&gt;Hm very big price difference tho Average eve player only has 2 accounts. That's only 30 bucks a month less if buying longer. Been awhile since I looked but p sure you can't even "play" star citizen for that. If you want a single decent star citizen ship to walk around in a hanger you gotta spend as much as you would spend on an eve sub for a full year
---
Yup. though as of this moment SC will not have any monthly fees, we'll see if that lasts. So technically the money you spend on it could last you until SC will be shut down unless you lose your ship of course, which is very likely. SC is more of a buy to play at the moment rather then anything else, with that "buy" part being way too expensive.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
CR has also said that there won't be that much of a grind to get ships in SC, but in game indicators point otherwise and he said a lot of shit which we of course know has not and will not be coming true.
---
Goons will come they must come
---
(still not in tri PGL)
---
Bebopping along. See a Sigil in HS that is suspect. Flying a bomber myself. Decide to take a shot and see what happens. About 2 seconds before it dies, a bowhead flyies across my torps path to the sigil, and it vanishes. A leshak pops out and begins to neut me empty, but not before I aligned and hit warp. It was a lucky break. I had never witnessed it before, and will never forget it. Gr8 b8 m8. I r8 8/8
---
&gt;don't ~~fly~~ lend to Radakos what you can't afford to lose.  
---
  
---
FTFY
---
I mean, I wouldn’t join skirmish fleet neither if I lost 6/6 equal not if favour in number skirmish in one day. 
---
(Btw could test please not buy out all eagle in jita, price is getting to high for me to run logistics)
---
It may be that "rare," but it's definitely not worth that. It's actually a fairly garbo ship so yeah...
---
In a WH, it becomes your floating home that docks at new and interesting systems all the time.
---
Nothing makes you quite as paranoid as having a POS full of loot and not getting a safe link to High Sec.
---
You will either be in a really organised corp that keeps their links shut down and guarded or you will learn to hate D-scan the way I did.
---
Until there is a slower 360 auto D-scan, I will never go back to living in one.
---
Surely you mean Revelations
---
There is only one war that matters. The Great War. And it's between the whalers and the whale.
---
FC Burnout...
---
Anyone remember year long wars with CTA's every day several times a day to take Moons in systems to advance to front.. 
---
You kids do make me giggle :)
---
&gt;While a game doesn't need a BR mode to be successful it does need to appeal to the pick up and play casual audience, which EVE does not.
---
Hmmmm
---
I wonder what would happen if ....
---
We had a few systems here and there with completely disrupted communications and sensor readings. These would disable not just local, but also all faction standing, player and ship names. Only thing you would see on your overview is a blank neut, and if you wanna know what ship it is, you'd have to zoom in on it and take a look.
---
That'd be kinda BR, but Eve style.
---
Make an alt?
---
Fleet discipline isn't what it used to be. FCs almost put more energy into dealing with their own fleet than the enemy.
---
I wonder what is the actual percentage of players that stay. If we knew that, looking at the steady slow decline rate(s), we might also be able to figure out how many players we lose.
---
 This reminds me why I left nullsec
---
WH life is fun!  If you learn how to roll the holes, you can always create content for yourself by rolling into a new wormhole chain.  Takes some time with lots of scanning though, but worth it!
---
I miss you Squishy. The dankest pvp fits.
---
If you think dscanning and probing are tedious chores, you won't like it.
---
If your flair's accurate, join the "Spoopy Public" channel in-game and learn about wormhole space from your own alliance mates. I think the Spoopers are still around.
---
You bugger, youve done it now. I’m investing in Eagles hahahahaha
---
Oh now you've done it
---
A single frigate shows up and he's just laughing thinking they're trying to spy on the base. Then the subcap fleet starts showing up and he gets increasingly concerned as the amount of frigate class ships starts to outnumber the amount of tie fighters that he has at their disposal. And then the capitals and supercapitals start to show up and he starts to get scared about the amount of power being brought to bare as hundreds or thousands of ships rivaling the size of a super star destroyer start to show up. And then the generation 1 titans jump in and he starts running for the nearest shuttle to GTFO.
---
You didn't have to bash towers one by one and they could be done in a lot less than 25 mins :|
---
Glad you’re having fun my man, the best adventures are the unexpected ones and other adventures, start in a venture hahaaa.
---
Fly safe, roll safe o7
---
That isn't even one of the nullified travelceptors.
---
I never understood what rolling a hole is, is that respawning it? I thought it was just closing down a hole..
---
I mean, I’ve found exploring enjoyable since I started playing and D scan is a habit at this point.. 
---
Also thank you for that, the spoopy guys are still around, I didn’t think of that, appreciate the idea :)
---
Unfortunately probably more true than false.
---
What kind of organisation shoots first and asks questions later?
---
&gt;  back in 2015
---
2014 and 2015 are the magic dates my friend. I guarantee you those numbers are vastly different then for example 2013 or 1st half of 2014. 2015 is when the major decline was already well on its way and with that, the active players left while the additional accounts stayed.
---
At any rate, even though in 2015 there was 1.5 average, we still had quite a bit more players then today.
---
If anything it was probably higher accounts/person pre2015 because isboxer was in full flow and everyone was multiboxing cattier ratters and shit.
---
This sub needs more skyrim memes
---
With just one alt, you will probably want to be in a large group. Larger groups share the workload out and lessen the need for having multiple alts there. Wh space is soooooo much better with multiple accounts though, giving you a lot more options for gameplay and hole security.
---
Fly dangerously, friend. o7
---
The first sentence made it sound even more interesting, and then it went all downhill hahaha.
---
I mean that feeling of paranoia, not knowing, having to be careful and to expect the unexpected, is fun isn’t it? 
---
Also I’ve lived in null for about 3-4 months now, I’ve got my fair share of pvping but I feel there is only so much I can learn with the current play style, null feels way too safe, it feels safer than hisec.
---
&gt;Now obviously injectors have helped that a little
---
Quite frankly, it seems they help established players more.
---
I'm just surprised people actually still fall for progod's goon third party bait.
---
Dying to rats probably leaves less evidence? Since  who ever loots wreck could be anyone randomly passing by and not easily accused of rmt like when you kill corvette and loot 20 injectors from it
---
Lend?
---
we build them all locally actually
---
Fleet discipline is a really interesting thing. Generally I think if you find yourself telling people they need to stop being shit or some other euphemism on a regular basis then the problem lies with the FCs rather than the fleet members. If you're not being clear and consistent in every instruction it's no surprise they're not getting followed.
---
On the other hand enabling bad behaviours by waiting for that one guy who never aligns, or target calling differently because of target splitting, or hour long form ups because people keep turning up late, or a whole bunch of other little things just become [normalisation of deviance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljzj9Msli5o). Sometimes you just have to let shit hit the fan stand down/let people die/lose fights so that folks learn the hard way.
---
Johnny Splunk best man I ever met in eve ever
---
I see, I have read that some people use scouts, haulers etc.. But for me running more than 2 accounts gets tedious. 
---
Now that you mentioned corps, without being biased could you suggest 2-3 decently sized WH corps, I’m pretty sure you’re familiar with most as you’re a wormholer.
---
I’m generally against bigger corps as I don’t find it fun to always overpower the enemy, but also id like a Corp that could also always put up a good fight, sorry if I didn’t word it properly but I hope you get my point..
---
lol these forum porn attempts are pretty sad
---
I hope the redact it.
---
&gt;Something else that is critically important but that we don't really take seriously is following the primaries.  Lately we've been splitting our damage across multiple targets.  I don't believe this is malicious or incompetence, I believe this is because broadcasts are coming in and primaries are being called and people are confusing the order of primaries.
---
EVE is very hard.

How do you make a squishy video even better? Not possible! 
---
Squishy- "hold my quafe"
---
You just posted a video smoking the most risk averse pilot in our corp, who happens to be my BFF - and good Bob did he eat some shit. The joy and smug you have provided me is beyond words.  
---
I knew throwing up some o7's  and OMFG's in local while hunting you would pay off. Now stand still on the gate so i can expand my squishy corpse collection kthxdie
---
Fighting an offensive war in Eve2k19 sucks massive dongs in complete shocker
---
calm down miner
---
Not as sad as planning a dreadbomb for 3 months and then having to srp all your allies because of badly you failed.
---
Your own spoopy newbies would be good for you probably. Scary wormhole people are the biggest in j-space I think.
---
Maybe not 100%, but its usually pretty high.
---
lol these invasions attempts are pretty sad
---
/u/CSMprogodlegend is a massive donglord but he actually attempts stuff (dreadbombs, invasions, deployments), which is better than 97% of the playerbase. Shitting on people for trying big plays just encourages stagnation and boredom for everyone.
---
Shit's pretty bad when some F1 shitter from Horde with broken English casually shits on you.
---
id take onecycling towers anyday over the citadel bs we have now...
---
Depends on the pooch.
---
Best luck with your RL proyects, what you and the others have created with Signal Cartel is truly amazing.
---
Delete TAPI tbh
---
Split your guns otherwise all those other fleets might kill stuff before you can whore. You know, the other 250 man fleets you brought in addition to your primary fleet. 2019.
---
BoB war and we’re in a fleet of a hundred or so BS’s warping to POS, and FC gave us all wrong password.
---
Upon slamming the POS shield we notice Orange Species is there and DD’d us all.
---
Question is did we get wrong password or was it changed before warping.
---
You decide.
---
Jokes aside, that was some *superb* editing, my dude. You make it look seamless, as if that was what *actually* happened in that scene.
---
Thanks for the update Captain Ahab.
---
OK Herman Melville, settle down.
---
maybe dont shoot blue fcs like autists and you might have more support in the war :^)
---
Pathfinder looks pretty but its UI is garbage imo. Tripwire is best for functionality.
---
I loved how it starts with two full paragraphs dedicated to explain people how to anchor... and then a couple more about shooting the primary target.
---
EVE truly is a difficult game.
---
And they had to walk uphill in the snow both ways, too
---
&gt;I get it, I don't sit in an ivory tower suckling isk from the teat of this alliance.  I have to make my own personal isk like you do.  I also understand rorq mining is criminally boring.  I get you want to watch netflix/hulu/else and chill while rorq mining.  If you can't do this and organize your windows in such a way that you can see intel channels/your overview and be able to respond to things happening in neighboring systems or even in your system, don't rorq mine.  Just don't.  Your apathy in rorq mining carelessly is costing us on every level, it's making it worse for everyone else in the alliance, and it makes us look weak and dumb.  It makes us look weak and dumb because we are acting weak and dumb.  Avail yourself of the forum posts on the subject of rorq mining and keep that information in your mind when you are out in space.  When you are undocked you need to be paying attention, just because we have an umbrella doesn't give you carte blanche to be inattentive and waste our time and resources.  Please immediately comply with this simple request and lets improve this situation together.
---
But I thought it was a good thing that all those Rorqs were being culled??
---
Wall o text to inform people that spring has arrived, and anchor. I`d like to belive that simple fleeting behavior is an easy corp talk, but seeing this on an alliance scale, makes me wonder what the heck you are recruiting of corps? but stilll, fun read.
---
dw capri, I actually made a longpost in the thread about normalizing the deviant. And yes, I referenced the Challenger. I gotchu.
---
Agreed /u/csmprogodlogend does more than 99% of the f1 splerges in this game
---
He might fail, but its this shit thats stoping this game from dying
---
The mouthbreathers that say othereise can fuck off, bunch of cunts
---
It's almost like we have whole corps dedicated to new players who need to be taught the basics of the game.
---
Thanks!
---
but this mix of us being red and blue to them makes us purple, so now we are stealthier and can hunt them better
---
I DO!!!
---
I was just saying the words to the ludicrous speed sequence until I saw that, then I died.
---
If you have a static hole, like a low security hole, when you close that one down, a new one spawns for you.
---
If you roll a "static", you are guaranteed to get a new hole.
---
Using my home hole as an example, it has a 3/5 static, so once I roll the C3 static I am guaranteed that a new C3 will spawn. Once I roll the C5 I am guaranteed a new C5. Occasionally "rogue holes" will appear, which usually means someone rolled into us with a C4 static, or just a random hole popping out of nowhere.
---
I'll always upvote someone's spaceballs.
---
Stuff like this is why I enjoy coming here. Neat story, good job!
---
grr g0ns
---
You should pull your emergency stop lever.
---
&gt; old and outdated 
---
which still pulls that site up as the number one result because of how accurate it used to be so people trust Google like they do
---
It's almost like you should stop poaching corps from brave to inflate your dwindling numbers.
---
Ain't that the truth.
---
God damnit thats why the raven disapeared... Well at least we wiped out iridium. Fly dangerous o7
---
For someone who proclaims himself to be the subject matter expert on this topic, you really were mediocre at best in practice. Guess the old adage is true, those who can't do teach.
---
Oh snap!!
---
Thanks Mynxee, best of luck to you in your personal projects and continued success to Signal Cartel. You and yours are a part of why Eve is great! o7
---
Damn dawg you gotta risk it for the biscuit, no shame in that
---
SovPvP in eve 2k19 is inherently retarded because of citadel's thanks CCP
---
I think so, but your dread should have no problems tanking. Just run in TQ and have two buddies in Nestors or Rattles do a site nearby while you experiment. If you run into trouble (AFTER you kill the avengers), have them come in and help you finish the site.
---
Now, here's something that I find interesting.
---
For TEST, "anchor on FC" means "orbit at 2500 meters". For me, "anchor on FC" means "set to approach". What's the reasoning for doing one or the other?
---
"....Our behavior of late is creating costly setbacks in our attempt to prosecute this war and, if not resolved expediently, could actually lead to the loss of our space and the execution of our famous contingency plan (which, all jokes aside, would actually drive corps to leave TEST and put us back where we were 6 years ago)."
---
Lol at the TAPI's overused under dog card at play again. 
---
A constant threat of "OMG eviction" has run it's course, because it's not true. TESTs self image and general victim-narrative of being an underdog fighting alone vs rest of the world isn't authentic or believeable. Simply because it's not true, being the 2nd strongest group (and pets to the the strongest group) ensures TAPI considerable safety.
---
What it does is undermine the credibility of it's top leadership and that Cascades into apathy eventually. Everyone and their mum knows Sapparo is bullshiting about eviction, so the whole of his post suddenly is like 'yea yea whatever'. 
---
There isn't any entity wilking or able to engage the combined largest Titan and super fleet in the game, combined largest subcap fleets in the game etc.
---
Is this unique accounts or...
---
Side note, what are your opinions on FC's owning their mistakes? I think it's a good trait for a ~~FC~~ **person** to be able to admit when hes wrong. I also agree that sometimes you need to let the bads learn their lessons by dying in a fire.
---
Also this is not player built. CCP made one in hisec under an NPC corp before they were made available to the players.
---
TBH prob not, why would anti-legacy groups care about provi's issues with lowsec people?
---
Do you normally put webs and scram on a hel? Have I been doing this wrong the whole time?
---
Strong campaign from the most battle hardened force in Eve
---
Completely legit.
---
What are alts? He formed for this op
---
2000m3 easy in a fast hauler, fitted for speed in the lows and tank in the mids. Use a cloak II in the high slot, learn the mwd cloak trick, amd spend 1-2 extra jumps to avoid the jita-peri gate.
---
Honestly, I lost interest in logging in to fleet up when rorq tards constantly ignore pings and die like fucking morons. Why should I bother to spend time in fleets to secure/defend territory, or to even get into rorq save fleets when the fucking krabbers obviously don't care?
---
Because of the above, a random line member like me just shrugs and does something else with my time. Fuck the krabs.
---
Depending on what it is, I prefer the keep at range. Let the FC's ship dictate the movement of mine. Approach and I could bump and fuck it up when he's trying to align.
---
man getting people to align right and anchor before they shoot is like herding cats
---
the quality of eve pvp would go up 200% if people could actually try abit.
---
Best PvE in the game is wormhole rolling
---
Is the "famous contingency plan" mentioned in the post simply to fold Test into goons and be done with it?
---
Approach is mainly for fleets that use command destroyers with MJD as the fleet is in a tighter composition that when orbiting at 2500. So the guys "boosting" are more likely to catch everyone in it. 
---
I've had three different ways on anchoring that I have used, approach, orbit at 2500 and keep at range 2500. A more seasoned fleet FC might be able to correct me on all this as I've only really done small gang stuff as an FC.
---
TAPI leadership in general have this victim complex where no matter what there position is, they'll go out of the way and even sound super dumb (like in this case) to peddle the narrative that they're the underdogs or victims of x atrocity.
---
Props to Test for recognising they look "weak and dumb" but yes it's embarrassing that an alliance that considers itself elite PvP has to keep posting classes on what aligning and anchoring mean.
---
CVA eleet.
---
"WHY THE FUCK HAVENT U MINED THE ARKONOR YET FUCCBOI???????? AND STOP GETTING YOUR ALTS INTO POSITION!"
---
Does the new CEO have any intention of embracing PvP in a PvP game? What is his stance on littering containers in other peoples' wormholes?
---
I am about 9 days into playing EvE, and have around 33 million ISK. I definitely enjoy PvE missions and doing exploration for relic/data sites, so thats where most my money has come from. Does that sound normal or am I missing something for earning ISK faster and easier?
---
The only thing bo-ld has ever taught new players is how to blue fuck.

I agree these names listed are indeed z-list

Hi Cyclo
---
That's ranking them a bit high
---
That sounds normal. Your earning power will increase as your skills improve.
---
Hi Soder.
---
Best of luck new dudes
---
It's hugely important but once the training wheels of your initial "newbie fc" experiences are off it's a tough to do emotionally.
---
Critical introspection is a tough enough thing to do on its own, compound that with it coming on the back of a feed or loss you feel bad about, directly witnessed by potentially a couple hundred fleet members who put their trust in you many of whom won't be so sympathetic to your failures, and the generally unfriendly atmosphere of the wider peanut gallery that is the EVE community,  it's no surprise that only a tiny portion of players gain an affinity for it.
---
I'm sure virtually every decent FC does own their mistakes internally, I don't see how you could improve if you didn't, but it also doesn't surprise me that most of them don't do it too publicly either.
---
&gt;50 shades of gay lol

ftfy
---
Buy more Phantasms please. ^^^I ^^^don't ^^^have ^^^any ^^^ulterior ^^^motives ^^^at ^^^all ^^^in ^^^making ^^^this ^^^statement
---
Well blame the mouth breathing dev that thought damage caps (that weren't there to stop structures being RFed in 60 seconds) + auto repairs instead of defenders repairing + set windows instead of the still solid stront bays of towers and finally no natural cap to limit the number of structures per system. What I'm trying to say is for all the flaws they had POS's were much better designed and they really should have just kept most of the features of POS's instead of throwing them in the dumpster. Also if they rolled back to the last iteration of dominion sov and added in a retarded damage cap to stop structures from insta poping before reps could land, then it would be 10x better then the current system.
---
Dear Mr Squishy,

As I understand it is defensive war. Fraternity is the aggressor.
---
Or was I lied to? o_O
---
That's more teaching than most brave corps have done lately. Forcing spodbrains to inject to hac doctrines is a lot easier than teaching them how to be decent pilots.
---
Pretty sure a boosh comp would want people to keep at range instead of approach to prevent the booshers from being bumped?
---
They've never taken new players lol. They're entire life span has been taking a wave of brave players who get enough sp to get sick of braves shit and have gone bitter. They fucking call themselves a high sp corporation, don't try to tell me they're a newbro corp. Cagali has totally ruined Brave sure, but that doesn't make a self described high sp corp newbro friendly.
---
&lt;3, Mynxee, Johnny, Thrice!
---
there's always different views on keep at range vs orbit but approach is kind of ass because sometimes the FC gets bumped and everyone gets screwed, keep at range 500 is the common "stick next to me" one
---
I was talking about brave as a whole my dude.

Ok lmao
---
I'd put money on that being an issue with floating point numbers.
---
Floating point numbers, or floats, are how computers most commonly store numbers that are either non-whole or very very large.  They're nice in being able to represent an enormous range of numbers with good precision, but they're usually not exact.  They can only store a number exactly if it is an exact multiple of a power of 2.
---
If we take 243,537 veldspar, at 0.1 m^(3) each, that's 24,353.7 m^(3).  That is *not* a perfect multiple of 0.5 (2^(-1)) or 0.25 (2^(-2)), or any other power of 2.  It will be rounded.  The EXACT value that would be stored in a double precision floating point value is 24353.70000000000072759576141834259033203125, which is a multiple of a power of 2.  Similarly, the EXACT value stored with 26463 units of veldspar is 2646.30000000000018189894035458564758300781250000000000.
---
In principle, a MTU should be able to pick up cargo if (MTU Capacity) - (MTU contents volume) &gt;= (cargo volume).  However, due to floating point imprecision we find that 27000 - 24353.70000... actually equals 2646.29999999999927240423858165740966796875000000000000.
---
For all practical intents and purposes 2646.29999999999927240423858165740966796875000000000000 and 2646.30000000000018189894035458564758300781250000000000 are both 2646.3, but to a computer they are not the same number and the former is smaller than the latter, not greater than or equal to. 
---
The reason why it works with round numbers is that 1 is a power of 2 (it is 2^(0)) so all relatively small whole numbers can be represented exactly by floating point numbers.  If we use 240,000 veldspar that has a volume of EXACTLY 24,000 m^(3).  If we take 27,000 m^3 - 24,000 m^(3) we get EXACTLY 3,000 m^(3), with no roundoff error.  The "less than or equal" evaluates to true, as the two sides are equal.
---
*********
---
Note that this is why accounting software does not generally use floats for money, despite money usually using non-whole values.  It's better to use an integer number of cents than to deal with this issue constantly.  If there were a consistent "least volume multiple" in Eve then that would be the way to implement volume, but with ammo commonly coming in odd, tiny multiples that are subject to change with balance it is justifiable that they went with floats. 
---
This is also why one should never use a simple check for equality when dealing with floats unless there's a need to check for bit-for-bit true equality.
---
I also found it interesting while examining this question that there are two ways of writing the logic and one seems to have this problem while another does not, at least for this particular set of numbers.  Mathematically, (MTU Capacity) - (MTU contents volume) &gt;= (cargo volume) is the exact same statement as (MTU contents volume) + (cargo volume) &lt;= (MTU Capacity), but they imply a different order of rounding.  When I tried the rounding for the second statement it actually all canceled out for these specific numbers.

Lied to. Fraternity space is being invaded

My mom was smart.  When I was a baby, she used me to guard her head from said basketballs
---
Localized entirely in your kitchen!?
---
I play usually 1 day a week all day, and a few other days for an hour or so. Some weeks i will play all day multuple days and otger times i will go weeks at a time without logging on. The nice thing about eve if youre subscribed is your skills will keep training if you play or not. So if you have limited playtime you can come back a week later and have new stuff unlocked to play. Ive been playing for about a year, still consider myself a new player, and have had tons of fun the entire time ive been playing.
---
Mittens final solution to the TEST problem.
---
FRT looks blue because you both declared war against TEST. There is overview color setting option on war allies.
---
Brave is a whole sucks right now sure, Cagali has totally fucked the alliance, but bo-ld is not and has never been a newbro corp. If they're bloated its becuase they don't kick inactives, not becuase test is grabbing brave corps to get them ewar frigate numbers up.
---
 “I pull him deeper into my mouth so I can feel him  at the back of my throat and then to the front again. My tongue swirls  around the end. He's my very own **Christian Grey**\-flavored popsicle. I suck harder and harder.… "
---
We didn't do it for isk
---
You should do similar fleets. You get really excited when someone finds a marauder, so ylue all warp over to whore on it
---
Plus, the guy who ran it has 'enough' isk, so who do you give the rest to? First comes first served? The guys there for the most time?
---
There's no good method to share isk, so blap every ship, flog whatever drops and everyone is happy. I waltzed out with almost 200 corpses
---
o7 and thx for everything
---
They isboxed. We're doing our part to ensure cheaters don't proper. Maybe you could try the same idk
---
Better then 97% for content generation.... you do realise that Legacy has killed content in the south right? 8 regions blued up with goon playmates next door ready to save them when the going gets tough. They're probably only fighting the FRAT cause they wouldn't agree to some retarded 2 year NIP demanding rent or something dumb like that and they though they could win due to all the koolaid they drown themselves in.
---
I can tell you need more than 2 had a guy try and just kill the sheilds but i have drone durability trained
---
Sig cartel, the only Corp on my no-shoot list. Including the Corp I’m in.
---
Lmao, anyways pgl needs as many high sp duders in brave as possible when he's having to tell tapi to get out of basis and voltron to get in, because tapi have shit fits and not enough stock on market to refit. Times are tough.
---
I read it as &gt;EVE Online.... is... breaking
---
To be fair I would hazard a guess that tapi would struggle mightily to contest NC. without pappa bee, so 3rd place would probably be more accurate but otherwise your point is solid
---
Haven't you heard? Goons are neutral on pgls overview, he will even screenshot to show you.
---
Lol ccp, you don't dare touch goons or init, they will destroy the game.
---
Isnt this what AAR are for??
---
Sure summarize a battle, but for the most part you are to recall what happened, what mistakes were made on your part that caused you to die. This sort of reflection after the adrenaline has subsided allows you to see what to do differently next time.
---
Or to summarize a win because the enemy fc made a mistake and you capitalized on it. Because you recognized that what he did was a mistake and you knew not to do that/what the counter was.
---
At least thats what i was taught in Gclub. Thought that was standard everywhere
---
Atm tapi would lose a 1v1 against frat. Without voltron tapi would barely break top 5.
---
yes without progod your titan would lack killmarks, I agree 100% #leaveprogodalone
---
reading this actually makes me want to rejoin test
---
&gt;Sapporo
---
" This is in regards to all levels of fleets, skirmish or stratop or fun roams or else. "
---
hmm
---
Don't  worry, they got laid off years ago and are much happier now.
---
I sort of envy this guy. He has the 0 care attitude to whelping ships. I have a lot of ISK but can I justify it to myself of doing that even if I really want to? Heck no.
---
Now I'd probably engage with my throwaway capital bit differently but still. Kudos to the guu for having the courage to so this.
---
[Yeah I'd say so](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98559022/reset/group/101/losses/)
---
Huh, that's strange, [the slopes are going in the other direction](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Test_Alliance_Please_Ignore)
---
Top tier shitpost. You got my updoot
---
Nobody cares scrub kys
---
Panfam faltered last time they tried. Since then, PL is truly dead, GotG is on other side, NC.s income has been falling, TAPI is maintaining or improving its income, I'd say the advantage TAPI has only increased many folds.
---
Now let's imagine what those numbers would look like if they reflected inactivity :thinkies:
---
I believe some of the t3 cruiser skills were removed at the point they changed their design. Not 100 percent sure.
---
TAPI is stagnating for the sole reason they're not dickswinging the titans. It's a content war primarily and titan dickswing ends that in an instant. 
---
This point i'd concede to Tapirium,  they dont run dry the contents with titandickswings like NCPL would do.
---
Better get mining to pay it back
---
Lmao, progod literally said himself that caps haven't been used much because of on point cyno jamming from frat. This is as much of a content war as any other war in the history of eve.
---
&gt; Call line members idiots, retards, morons, etc. on every single fleet
---
&gt; Morale is plummeting
---
&gt; Blame line members for not being good enough
---
lol Solid 10/10 alliance update.
---
So that was an entire essay about how bad TEST linemembers are and he's wondering why no one is joining fleets? Zero accountability on behalf of the FCs in that wall of text. Problems in EVE start at the TOP and filter down, not the other way around.
---
last time I tested it took like 4+ mins to ewarp so it's super easy to get fucked by a DC.  Haven't seen anything to suggest that's changed.
---
Afaik the last NDA breach ban didn't get a public blog post.
---
Nice Rig.  I just got mine the other day.  I went with Digital Storm.  My last DS lasted 7 years and it was time to retire it.  So much nicer to have a new machine!  Enjoy!
---
You mean like pulling a massive betray/steal/disband on his corp?
---
Shh, you are like the dark side whispering to the chosen one.
---
Hey dude, nice phantasm piloting!
---
What overview pack do you use?
---
This is Eve, not a court of law.  And no one said "treason".  
---
Well, until you did.
---
The tinfoil is strong with this one :thonking:
---
probably from a lore perspective guns are not fired eight as one
---
Hot.
---
Thanks! I've created my OV myself!
---
If CCP unbans Brisc, they had better unban gigX.
---
You gotta do more of these man, they’re amazing.
---
Your first mistake was allying with GSF
---
Anveri, you were probably asking for it :P
---
Couple hundred people so far
---
Wtaf did i just see?
---
I don't get it is there another page?
---
Bump bad yes
---
Tinfoil? Buddy maybe you havnt been around long enough, but this screenshot is far from the first one from discords or other chatrooms where all the FCs are buddy-buddy.
---
Is it really though?
---
Amen
---
Oh no dude you're completely right, you totally have 17k active peeps, I concede your well argued point.
---
Holy fuck they need a high level person to establish what basic fleet commands are?
---
Alternative option. This is what we use;
---
https://wormholes.new-eden.io
---
If you approach it means you end up bumping the FC if there’s a funky turn or something. At minimum you want to use keep at range over approach.
---
Nice straw man. Because I'm *totally* arguing that every character is active and useful, rather than arguing that our membership has been a consistent net gain.
---
there are dozens of us
---
yea u kicked him yet?
---
Oh, noes, you used strawman on me, we've got ourselves an intellectual here bois. You're arguing numbers on a page, I'm arguing active pilots, at the end of the day only one of those actually matters.
---
&lt;alien hands&gt;SEO&lt;/alien hands&gt;
---
Then if you're like me, your ability to lose isk rapidly will also increase as you start welping cooler and cooler stuff against goons.
---
All the best, space mum!
---
Hope to meet you again one day. o7
---
It honestly depends more on the doctrine then anything else. If you need to track your keep at range. If your booshing its approach. If your in a missile based or sig tanking doctrine you orbit. FCs should take 2 seconds at the beginning of the fleet just before undocking to clarify their expectations. What anchor type your using. Default ammo initially. How they want guns grouped or split. If there is a dedicated anti tackle guys to assist drones to so they can do their job etc.
---
Panfam faltered due to goon intervention, you were speaking specifically to the strength of the individual alliance. Highly unrealistic that a 1v1 would ever take place, but in relative weight of fleet strength NC. has a pretty considerable advantage in the size of their titan fleet, even tho tapi's has improved dramatically NC started with so much more tapi has yet to close that gap. When tapi can solo field 200 titans in a fleet then we can re evaluate this conversation
---
Why are you so salty about signal cartel
---
Looks great.
---
Will you share the fitting? Looks like you're using beams?
---
Is that what you call shifting the goal posts these days? I just thought it was called bullshit, but I guess if you want to get all fancy about it that's okay too.
---
Dafuq, how they burning out ? 
---
We havent even gotten past the warmup part. Lay of the damn donuts son
---
fraternity space is ostensibly under threat of invasion though forward progress by the aggressors remains to be seen
---
better?
---
thumbsup!
---
&gt;We have a team of stratop commanders that are excellent, quite possibly the best in the game. 
---
sides status: low orbit
---
We sometimes blue FRT in the middle of fleets to avoid confusion with our new players. But if you were to check their standings right now they would be neutral. 
---
SkillU I honestly don’t remember, but I actually think they are normally blue
---
That's good logic on paper, but speaking from personal experience you'll be spending quite a bit more time than 3 hours while experiencing at least double the frustration when trying to get a replacement part from iBuyPower.
---
* approach-anchoring keeps you closer to the fc, but will frequently bump the fc, particularly in turns. don't approach-anchor unless you're told to  
---
* orbit-anchoring is a good way to maintain transversal when the anchor is moving slowly, or when there's not a great need to move in any particular directiion. useful when under threat of bombing  
---
* keep at range-anchoring is useful when the direction your ship is facing is important. stukas wouldn't function without keep at range anchoring, for instance
---
keep at range anchoring is the least likely to get you into trouble as a default behavior because it keeps you on the anchor without bumping him. but, pay attention to what your fc says
---
Do continue being awesome. o7
---
That'll be $1900 please
---
soft agree
---
shitting on people who actually attempt stuff is fine as long as you're doing it for the right reasons - like that time pgl used "i messed up earlier and now i have to stream a spicy wing challenge" as an excuse not to follow up on the timers he created during the mto deployment
---
like
---
i don't blame the guy for trying to drop a fort in autz, and i don't blame the guy for trying to make *something* happen after an otherwise boring month-long deployment where they spun their wheels the whole time
---
what i do blame the guy for is the horseshit excuses he comes up with to explain the times when he denies content (and also being a massive donglord)
---
just own your shit man
---
Yeah. I remember like it was yesterday. Oh wait XD
---
it varies by alliance.  Most have rules such that you can't buy out stuff and relist.  You're probably better off just importing.  That is good money, tbh.
---
Your corp taught me to fly when I started playing in 2016.  Thanks for all you did for Signal.  Fly clever o7
---
bring back POSspam
---
We've known for years that CCP has major problems with their handling of bans. This is just the most recent high profile incident. But the whole Stunt and Erotica1 things should give you pause. Hell, they banned someone for vandalizing the eve monument that had never been to Iceland.
---
Grr goons
---
Signal taught me to fly back in 2016.  Thanks for all you've done.  Signal Cartel/ Eve Scout is a special part of this weird game.
---
18-hour facwar siege fleets man.
---
If it doesn't matter why do you do it at all
---
&gt;chart a more independent course and go for the top spot
---
I appreciate the sentiment but noone is going to pass goons unless they either internally implode or test switches sides. It's numerically not feasible.
---
Can't watch the video but I assume you cyno in right off grid(with a blue cyno?) then immediately warp-&gt;bomb?
---
the last event was crap but the two before were actually very interesting (the one in the snow and the other with drug factories)
---
&gt;What would James 315 do?
---
He would beat himself off at his epic meta RP characterization when he's actually just the leader of the flavor of the month piracy/gank crew
---
After playing EVE for a year and half, a question hit me. Why am I wasting my time play this game?  I felt meaningless spend time on it.
---
Why are you leaking AOL messenger conversations
---
Sorry but in TAPI narrative it's a defensive war
---
&gt; Our behavior of late is creating costly setbacks in our attempt to prosecute this war and, if not resolved expediently, could actually lead to the loss of our space and the execution of our famous contingency plan (which, all jokes aside, would actually drive corps to leave TEST and put us back where we were 6 years ago).
---
Can tigers even meow
---
Tapi is bigger and richer than NC. 
---
But in a 1v1 my money would be on the alliance that already knows what aligning and keeping at range mean, and not the one that fail-warps to random keepstars when told to go to a jump gate.
---
Imagine not being able anchor correctly :mexican_man_with_no_teeth_and_contagious_laughter:
---
You did a wonderul job u/Mynxee 
---
Hope to see you around, best of luck o7
---
God I hope so. 
---
If we have to start over, the sunk cost fallacy and stockholm syndrome will be gone and I can finally stop playing this shit game!
---
I would love to be a part of SC myself, but I like shooting people too much as I explore ):
---
Didn't you hear the man, it's not a content war; it's about TAPI survival
---
&gt; if not resolved expediently, could actually lead to the loss of our space and the execution of our famous contingency plan (which, all jokes aside, would actually drive corps to leave TEST
---
Wot, they lost multiple of them ??
---
actually ibeast used Faradenza in 2018 vid and thats where i gut the inspiration from :)
---
Well said.
---
I don't know... I too think about that the whole time. Warping to the fort, rep up, reengage would make totally sense to me. Only the TEST fleet could have held the grid for long enough for sure.
---
But I can't look into the minds of the FIRE FC, I guess there is a reason why they didn't disengage
---
he didn't. he just pinged the op for Big Pops
---
since when?
---
No, that's way too slow. You light the cyno on-grid 30km off the rock.
---
&gt; But in a 1v1 my money would be on the alliance that already knows what aligning and keeping at range mean, and not the one that fail-warps to random keepstars when told to go to a jump gate.
---
yeah that's not FRT

Nice to see you responding to this. It's all anyone in PF was talking about today. You had to know that shit would draw the crabs, particularly in a system like PF. So I was wondering... Why?
---
We should do a CTA, and then blow up all Rorquals in TAPI space, that do not honour the CTA.
---
If they brought towers back i would resub all of my accounts in a heartbeat.
---
You escaped safely to Morder through Orthanc.

Tripwire is definitely not superior....

Yeah in CHTZ. I mean most of the times FRAT simply stay docked unless they massively outnumber us.

I have an explorator character where I do solo lowsec/wormhole hacking. I look for sansha relic sites, or really any other relic/data anomalies level 3-scanning difficulty or higher. I know there are interesting finds such as sleeper caches and ghost sites. I am mildly irritated at how many wormhole sites have sleepers on them because I can't do them. Two questions: 
---
1. What else is there for a solo hacker that is interesting and/or profitable?
---
2. A lot of explorers seem to be using Astero, while T2 frigs have similar requirements but are cheaper and maybe even better for the job. Why is Astero so dominant? Is it because of fitting layout? Or am I talking nonsense?
---
i wonder if their famous contingency plan is "go back to fw again"
---
Sick!!
---
more specifically, tapi dissolved the nap between them and frat about a week early because frat helped skillu anchor an offensive staging structure to hit xix from - iirc
---
Looks like it's this: https://zkillboard.com/kill/76334028/
---
Let’s make new good memories..
---
Everyday, I dream of owning a DS rig with an ultra wide monitor. What machine did you go with?
---
not everybody does formal AARs - mostly places that have semi-formalized fc training processes do, like horde has formal AARs including a forum section and a discord section where their fcs post them
---
but PL doesn't, we just informally debrief in fc channels if there was obvious stuff that could have gone better
---
This is litrally what happens when you let people like endegner in.
---
i want to disagree with you but i can't find the lie
---
capri is a *really* sharp theorycrafter and strategist but he does struggle to actually implement anything spicier than garden variety fcing

never forgetti feeding a dozen carriers to init in syndicate, etc
---
Lemme preface by saying I dont have a huge amount of experience with this I've only tried it a couple times
---
You really need at least 2 bombers,  but you can kill 1-2 excavators pretty well just by bomb+torping them down. They're incredibly slow. The trick is to find rorqs putting drones on rocks that are sorta far away.
---
If you want to bomb them down in one volley iirc you need 4 perfect skilled thermal bombers. On some fits the drones may survive at low hp, but lots of rorqs just stack drone speed shit, anyway just in case be prepared to torp them down.
---
we'll help
---
so what you're saying is that your alliance leadership has acknowledged that your fleet numbers are going down, yet you assert that your alliance is getting larger?
---
that's not better my dude
---
From my experience as a member of fleets (not an FC), I would say FCs that keep things tight, act fast, doesn't wait around much etc will push out more efficiency. 
---
This was especially notable in incursion running (sure, its PVE and not PVP, but still) - some FCs were laid back and there were always people not in the position, shooting the wrong targets, more logi mistakes etc etc. But some FCs were running their fleets like they are against the clock - more or less the same people flying, but people are more on point on what they should be doing and were they should be. Ofc, this option is more tiring to everybody and can burn out people though.
---
So yeah, stuff like aligning for a minute, not calling out bads, hell - even forming for an hour and not setting a precise time of departure just decreases the discipline of the fleet.
---
Only place I never had to do AARs was AAA, everywhere else a sort of formal AAR was required and it helped me to look over it myself and also have someone better than me read it and tell me where exactly they see mistakes. Though, I never lead fleets bigger than 50, I’m that bomber wing dude who has 4 - 6 wings or the occasional 50 man arty cane welpsquad.
---
just watch suitonia when he's streaming, at least he explains what he's doing.
---
Am i malinformed or is it now not more feasible to split damage as logistics are now softcapped?
---
Bad discipline enforcement from leadership and FCs lead to bad fleet discipline.
---
Why bother doing everything on point if you get SRP anyways? Not aligned? Sucks to die, but you'll get SRPed anyway (unless you really piss off the FC and he specially goes to SRP people and say NOT to SRP this guy). Looting during a battle? Its not like you'll get called out, kicked or shot. etc etc
---
If the FC is too laid back and forgiving than the fleet discipline is going to drop. Ofc, the counter problem could arise that people may not like a specific FC because he is too harsh and just not join his fleets...
---
\#whynot

oh ma god! That's a Iapetan!

First thing I thought

You can't beat dinobrain my dude.
---
i think most wh have them blue...although i hear rumors that bob is not happy with all the space littering they do. bloody cans in every wh i go lol
---
Good on Sappo about the rorqs. He doesn’t want a spodbrain alliance like goons.
---
Although he may already have it by the sounds of it...
---
That's a cute one.
---
Answer me one questions:  
---
Where did all the "experienced and well-equipped players" come from?
---
Fleet participation is really important, but so is pve. We're modelled on Goons, a lot of our income comes from the ratting, mining and refining taxes line members play. Our economy funds our war efforts.
---
A healthy alliance requires both active pvp'ers and krabbers - and ideally they shouldn't be different players i.e. krab in the quiet times and pvp when the strat/skirms are posted.
---
Out of curiosity, how has Cagali fucked the alliance? Honest question - don't know very much about him.
---
no but reddit allows me to pontificate semi-anonymously for meaningless internet points which is arguably more fulfilling
---

Obvious cheat since there is no ship loss on the other side and that pod was webbing heavily which made the whole difference....

go to a bigger hub and extract there ? just sayin...

You're a legend, Mynxee. Thanks for all the contributions you've had to the game.

&gt;  For example, I have 125 of my own Loki fits in pyfa - almost all of them are dogshit. 
---
i have about 20, but i prune mine pretty regularly
---
something about the loki just makes people wanna make a zillion fits for it
---
VNI botters aren't a problem as much as carrier/super bots. Those bots won't be affected by your solutions at all. 
---
If you wanna give lower bounty and higher loot, they'll just write a second bot which auto loots/salvages. I'm actually pretty sure one of those already exists. 
---
Sure, they may start in VNI's, but they'll leave those behind in a few months. They the "CCP Solution" will be left behind making life harder for real players.
---
what? undocking in your case? got it!

Hello china
---
1.) You have to look for low-class wormholes. There are 6 main classes (we just call them C1-C6), but C5s and C6s will mostly have sleeper exploration sites where there isn't a lot of loot and most of the profit comes from shooting the very dangerous sleeper rats. Just skip these. Use http://anoik.is and stick to C1, C2 and C3 holes. Try nullsec as well. 
---
2.) The Astero owes its popularity primarily to the low SP requirement. All other covert ops frigates require racial frigate V, which is a 9 day train, but  you only need two racial frigates to lvl 3 to fly the Astero, which puts you more-or-less on-par with the other frigates. The Astero is also a more capable PvP ship due to its strong capacitor which enables it to run a good active armor tank, as well as dish out respectable drone damage. 
---
3.) According to the [March Monthly Econonomic Report](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/5yg115tLvJMWpMvRw2UpK/563018bd34ef75341a0bba104c7f0a1c/3_mining.value.by.region_bar.png), the top 6 mining regions in the game are all in nullsec. This is because of the prevalence and proliferation of Rorquals in recent years - massive mining ships that can't be operated in highsec. So most ore by far comes from null.
---
Line members doesn't matter for PGL
---
You're a good pilot AP. Seriously.
---
Not just on tq either.
---
"I'm just glad we minimized our loses" basically PGL's mantra.
---
I think you may have misunderstood the question
---
Well even if 2000 Chinese people join TQ from Serenty and 10% not it’s only 200 people ... I’ll Bet goons has prob. Like 10x the rorquals and ratting Bots out right now .. + panfam/legacy/Winter Bots etc 
---
So doubt the Chinese bits will make a difference
---
such language timothy, and its Mr Spod-Brain thank you
---
Is there any evidence to back ‘facts 1-4’?
---
This does not prevent CCP from making a similar solution to capital and supercapital ratting.
---
To be honest, my solution would simply be : when a capital ship or above land in a combat anomaly, the rats get "scared" and warp away. That way, you’ll have tons of normal rats scattered accorded belts, gates and Deadspace safespots. No more super ratting, and ITS A GOOD THING.
---
Ah yes. All of TQ should unanimously agree to:
---
1- never sell a Skill Injector ever again
---
2- never sell PLEX on the market ever again
---
This will surely defeat the wave of China players.
---
Axe tho ... ?
---
All that you listed folding into goons would be a 107.000 character alliance, Panfam + winterco combined are smaller than goons atm so I don't see where that binary conflict would come from.
---
You should try joining an alliance with no krabs.
---
Your krabs need to work a lil bit harder, the "war effort" is not going so well.
---
While it looks cool (and congrats to you for your new rig) and a little empty (my 2 gpus, 6 hardrives, 6 ram sticks, cpu water cooler and box coolers take most of the space in my medium box) Eve is defined as you can play it on a toaster if the hamster providing power is well fed. And btw you need 5 monitors period.
---
But but... botting is illegal
---
Hey 'I was there!' for that one, best part wasn't the hel, it was him calling us all poor and smacktalking us in local while we bumped his alt's arazu out of tether. Good times had by all, Evan gets to flex his wealth, poor provi folk get to shoost stuff! Win, win!
---
In most alliances, people do occasional ratting or mining to let them afford PvP.
---
Sounds like in Test, people do occasional PvP to let them continue ratting and mining.
---
What do you expect when you spend your resources on 6 failed games and 3 outright cancelled games instead of spending an ounce of time on your main slice? 
---
Lets Rant:
---
* Dust 514: Great concept but published on an old console and wasn't integrated well. PC and could affect Nullsec sov? Smash hit overnight, literally every person in nullsec would own a copy. Captive audience much?
---
* Valkyrie: mediocre carnival sideshow of a game, really just a VR technical demonstration since the game *doesn't have any game  elements in it*. If you could pilot a bomber from a super I could see people buying this for shits and giggles and then putting it back on the shelf forever.
---
* Gunjack 1 and 2: More VR circlejerk.
---
* Project Nova: Maybe CCP didn't notice the fact that FPS shooters are a dime a dozen at the moment? What could possibly make this stand out other than being tied directly to new eden like Dust514, which it's not.
---
* Sparc: More God Damn Fucking VR Circle Jerk. And it's a sports game? Get the fuck out. But it's actually pretty cool, For circlejerk.
---
* World of Darkness Online: Spend 8 fucking years jerking yourself to vaporware.
---
* Eve: The Second Genesis: How the fuck do you *fail to publish a card game*? You just sell the rights to a card game manufacturer and watch the money pour in.
---
Finally,
---
Eve Online: What an absolute abortion. Where to start? The old codebase, the terribad NPE, the shit pve, not listening to players and changing major aspects of the game just for the hell of it, forcing out updates and having a fast release cycle to clickbait noobs instead of focusing on a full rewrite of code from over 15 years ago, basically every aspect of the game itself is fucking garbage. 
---
The only redeeming factor is the community, except it's fucking not because if you step a single fucking toe out of line from what is expected or wanted the entire community will fucking eviscerate you on the spot. Don't particularly care for forced pvp and want to stay in highsec, or don't really want to do massive alliance nullsec or want to do PvE primarily; congrats, you're basically a space n****r. What a fucking joke. 
---
I knew the moment they turned ~~P2W~~ I mean F2P the game was over. Don't believe me, look at player online counts. Every decision after Q1 2014 was wrong. Even the Q4 2016 spike was wrong because it was all F2P and the numbers were back to normal within 6 months, implying that the number of paying customers dropped a bit with the addition of some F2P customers.
---
Lets do some imagining. You are CCP. You're building a house for other people to live in. You start with 2 bedrooms, 2 baths and a kitchen. You slave away so you can add on a new bedroom + bathroom every 6 months like clockwork, no matter how hard managing the rest of the house is. In addition, you have a couple of side projects that eat up your time and energy. One day, you accidentally look up and notice every person in your house is super mad and yelling at you that there is not enough kitchen to go around. You have several options A) Close the kitchen and rebuilt it. Everyone will grumble and have to go somewhere else, but you can put all hands on deck fixing issues and have it back quickly, or B) Build an entirely new kitchen and then one day at midnight, redirect everything to that new kitchen. Sure its more expensive and will take a bit longer, but people can still use the old kitchen for now. In your infinite wisdom, you choose option C. You haphazardly turn the next bedroom you add on to the house into a kitchen, not by doing it properly, but by putting a mini-fridge and a cabinet in the corner of a bedroom and calling it a kitchen, not even having the common decency to remove the bed. You wonder why people are leaving your house.
---
So yeah, What do you expect when you spend your resources on 6 failed games and 3 outright cancelled games? It's almost like you were good at something and then did literally everything except that. Say it with me: Single Shard Sandboxed Space MMO.
---
Test tires easily.
---
TW#1
---
Feel bad for test. Actually, imagine having to explain primaries and aligning to your alliance in 2019, lol all day.
---
A once a year masterpiece, well done well done bravo, absolutely marvelous!
---
But surely the best way to counter them would be for everyone to stop playing the game!!
---
This would mean they have no content and they would be all alone, surely they would leave soon then!
---
Paper Dino
---
&gt; What players can do:
---
It's not players' job to correct bad game design.
---
&gt; Reduce ISK payout for NPC bounty in low/null, give more loot instead. Let the capitalism market do it's thing
---
Bots will loot and botters will sell the loot. If anything you just added another shit repetitive mechanics at which bots will be better because they don't get bored.
---
&gt; Change drone mechanism. 
---
&gt; Make NPC shoot at drones more often when they can't get in range to shoot the drone ship.
---
&gt; Fit some NPC with smart bombs to catch the drones
---
Your suggestions won't change much. It amounts to a small update for the program.
---
The real solution to botting is empowering players to do the job. Bots will inevitably always have to rely on local and overview. If there was a cloaky ship that is somewhat local immune (or local delayed), suddenly tackling bots won't be a problem anymore. In this case, as they die at sufficiently high rates, they would even be assets to this game (content for their hunters) rather than liabilities. Currently, bot hunting is extremely unrewarding.
---
Then again, for this to work, some plebs would have to give up their instant effortless intel via local for at least 1 ship class (in its most non-invasive version). Plebs don't want that, even though ultra safe overfarming (by bots or players) ruins the game's economy, so it's a race to the bottom.
---
johnnysplunk is a monster who refused to play Red Dead Redemption 2. Also refuses to give me my Faction Navi Domi fully fitted Alpha style that I legit won in his stream. On top of refusing to ever log into BDO and attempt Kzarka and Karanda kill with me, he visibly gagged when I suggest he ride the oceans with me on my Epheria Frigate. I cannot stop saying bad things about this man. Everyone who defends him is just plain wrongo. Pearl Abyss will never forgive johnnysplunk
---
&gt; VNI botters aren't a problem as much as carrier/super bots.
---
Want to cite a source on that one? It's weird seeing people talk about botting so matter o' factly. As if it'd be obvious to risk $80 USD supercarriers for MAYBE three VNI's worth of isk an hour. If you automate this process it makes sense to scale, systems support more VNI's and less is lost in warping or docking up due to align times. It's not funny losing $80 or isk/h in the case of docking/mishaps/traffic.
---
Botting supers in 2019 is a joke. Botting in 2019 is and continues to be trivial in EVE and ISK continues to be a black market product  which is not a great deal at $5/B when compared to $50 galaxy packs.
---
First corp I ever joined in Eve and glad I did. Enjoy your time off. We all appreciate the effort you've put into this and the road you've laid for so many to have traveled on
---
At least POS didn't have damage caps
---
I agree on your Point. I think the chinese Will change something on the map somewhere in the next 3 to 4 months. Probably a new big player to keep An eye out. We can only hope that they Will not ruin our economy as Mutch but i have full confidence that CCPlease Will add a solution once they see that our economy is going to shit because of the commies
---
.exe file is exefile.exe literally
---
Since always? Same way voltron is legacy
---
And this is why I don't miss null.
---
&gt; sell titans to members for &lt; 50b and supers for 12b.
---
Here's my bias: those don't matter to what I do in Eve. Yeah, I have skills for caps but I'd rather shove matchsticks up my peehole than to get into a cap again. Those are boring af.
---
Don't get me wrong, I know the ideal member krabs in the quiet times and fleets up when pinged, but instead the contrary is happening on a monumental fucking scale. Nothing drains my motivation to fleet up more than to see those fucking krabs actively selling bookmarks in alliance or demanding to get into krabbing standing fleets even though I'm in my logi ship trying to keep people alive. Or better still, the same goddamn parasites in forums moaning about pings going out with instructions for krabs to get safe.
---
My time spent in logging in to fleet up will not be used to benefit parasites.
---
doesn't really apply to sub cap logi in reality, you never really get close to the amount of logi you would need for it to be noticeable, the change was more targeted at dropping a full fleet of faxes.

So as you can see the only relevant(top at the time) things are the power source and the dell monitor. The rest are about average and were average at the time as well. So yes you do need at least 2000 usd to build a decent computer that lasts a little. I would expect the config to cost more than 2k even now.
---
The router is bonus and was bought about 2 years ago. Absolutely fabulous router, but you can ignore its price when doing the math.
---
What I particularly like in your story is that it was no question for you whether to make isk by doing relic sites while rescuing your raven.
---
Some imperium members still think goons vs panfam is a fight they're not supposed to win even though its 60k dudes vs 25k
---
well voltron is legacy because we share all the coalition services and leadership of the alliances make decisions together.
---
voltron is just a name for everyone forming into one fleet, it's not really an entity.
---
FI.RE, on the other hand, doesn't have access to legacy services (apart from the channels specifically setup for communication between leadership/fcs of two coalitions), doesn't get a seat at the legacy leadership table, just like legacy alliances don't get a seat at FI.RE leadership table.
---
so while there is no question about two coalitions working closely together, they aren't one and the same.
---
They have more than enough of those
---
Sure, its the same thing panfam and gotg used to be. You can definitely be coubted as the same entity
---
50 towers to fuel no thanks
---
Why does this feel like a /u/EliseRandolph 'Moral' post?
---
While I've done the same and will keep doing the same, the reason is because I'm too cheap and I'm an it engineer so would take it a little personally if I would fail to do at least this. But every time I was pretty nervous and every time it took a little to stabilize the builds, so (if not for the reasons above) I could easily see why someone would pay 10% to have the thing delivered (and hopefully tested).
---
Thank you for a detailed answer!
---
still wouldn't be enough to stand against the Imperium and legacy.

I'll never understand why people go with pre builts.

I quite like the idea of activity-based sov.  You know, mining, ratting and so forth, with any corp that attains sov in that respect able to transfer it to a holding corp or whatever, for ease of management in larger entities.
---
I flew a badger through 30 nullsec systems into venal today for reasons...

had next to no tank on it 6second align time and a prototype cloak.
---
managed to get past 5 different dudes, shit was intense!
---
just as thrilling as pewpew if you ask my - my arse was so tight it coudlve shat diamonds.
---
sure. but it wouldn't be called legacy or FI.RE. it'd be a coalition made up of those two. rather than reeee about fi.re being part of legacy, people should invent a clever name for the supercoalition
---
Most of them do care and join fleets themselves when not rorq mining.  The problem is you don't know but choose to judge and do something else with your time, which makes your space less safe for everybody else, not just the few krabs.  So in conclusion your attitude is quite selfish and I'm glad you're not in my alliance.
---
TEST has to decide what they want. 
---
Invade FRT? Do it right, use the full Supercap force &amp; call Daddy Goon to help. 
---
Only defend the borders against the "eastern menace"? Stop generating useless timezone tanked timers in FRT space. Stop with the useless "bring EVERYTHING, RED PEN, mega important Legacy CTA" for those timers. Stop burning out your members with this pointless shit. Organise some SIGs to harass FRT/defend the borders, give them generous SRP to do it and get people to participate. Let junior FCs lead to gain exp. Do big ops only to defend if its important.
---
All of this would be mostly fine if they just deleted small citadels.  At least when you put a bunch of effort into killing a fort you get a few billion out of it.

---
I'll give you bigger, but are you so sure it's richer?
---
We have a lot of older players and we've dominated moons and renting for 6-7 years.  
---
Before WWB, we could replace our titan/super fleet twice over. That's a long time ago.
---
Fucking love it.
---
Holy shit this is amazing.
---
My productivity took a sharp decline haha.
---
&gt; No more super ratting, and ITS A GOOD THING.
---
If you write it in capital letters it MUST BE TRUE.
---
T-Rex wasn't built for marathons :thinking:
---
Never watched it
---
Yes but that has no direct tie to citadels. they are just cancer in itself.
---
He's not wrong though
---
Do you even play eve Nullsec-Warfare?
---
As soon as a side (no matter which) clearly show weakness, they are endangered to become evicted. Always was and always will be, for the simple reason: Entertainment and power-showoff. Everybody wants to join the winning team, noone the losing team. So the pendulum can swing extremely fast.
---
Honestly, how long would you think PL, PH and SkillU would wait until they start pile in to evict TEST if TEST would lose a significant part of their super fleet?! I guess, it's a week tops.
---
No, reason to play a victims card. If you are playing bad, and bloody the water, you will always become the victim. No matter if you are TEST, TRI, DEADCo, BoT, old DRF, etc.
---
When it's people who never come to fleets, like those that die during a stratop, it's fine.
---
When the umbrella is active and we're still losing idiots, that's not fine.
---
Thank you for the analysis! I professionally SHOULD know all of this, but I often forget to consider type issues due to floats. This is probably the correct assessment of the issue.
---
I remember TEST was the only alliance that deployed to Delve after WWB.
---
Yes, I'm sure NC pilots are an elite breed and never have to be told to align more than once.
---
what being relevant?
---
Good now they won't know about the real secret weapon...sw-900's.
---
No but shit poster need no evidence.
---
get on it, there has never been a better time to rejoin the good guys, and if you need a bit more convincing please see this educational material. [Nullsec and you, enjoying the autism](https://dredditisrecruiting.com)
---
Look at what TEST had accomplished so months after moving into esoteria. Look at what frat accomplished after six months of peace.  Look at what horde had accomplished with their recruitment of newbies.
---
Now look back at Brave, see what resources they've had available over the past 18 months, and ask yourself why brave isn't on the same level as these other successful alliances.  Brave has been handed everything they should need and all they've done with it is tread water.
---
That's not because brave line members are substantially different from those in horde, test, or frat.  That comes from the top.
---
Good luck out there! Happy to see you return whenever you can! o7
---
&gt; If there was a cloaky ship that is somewhat local immune (or local delayed), suddenly tackling bots won't be a problem anymore. 
---
Neither would hunting and tackling real players. As every ratter started to lose their vnis in droves to people hunting them completely immune from any retaliation they would stop running them. And in the end the proportion of vnis that bot would approach 100% because only botters could put up with the losses by operating 24/7.
---
No.
---
A new recon ship that makes you not appear in local but it doesn't have a covert cloak and appears on dscan
---
So back to Delve?
---
&lt;3 awww.
---
Yeah, because dudes were lining up to attack Delve left and right before the Legacy nip.
---
SC only Corp that I stalk in WH to shoot anyone who even looks cross-eyed at them.
---
Fly safe, Space Mom
---
I would assume every big group has the same issues \*shrug\*
---
Personally don't think the fleets have gone that bad (from a legacy perspective). I think the worst thing we had was being requested to reship into something non-doctrine and the having to suffer PGL's wrath when the trade hub couldn't handle 200 people all trying to reship and fit non-doctrine. As a line member, i turn up to  stratop fleets, allign, anchor and shoot primaries like a good F1 monkey. I suck at logistics (not in the repping sense!) and need support from my alliance/corp to provide the ships they want.
---
this. they actually make "catching up" impossible
---
signal cartel are great
---
I'm pretty sure the point here is that he didn't.
---
What if he's actually innocent and didn't do anything wrong?  Did you consider that?

&gt; The only reason this is getting any attention at all is because it happened to a prominent player in-game who happens to be quasi -prominent outside of the game as well.
---
I'd rather it got no attention and all lobbyists had been shot. But sadly, we can not akways have what we want.
---
I'll have you know that a human pilot can actually protect his ship. That's the main difference between a bot and a human. A human can call for help on teamspeak.
---
gotta love that skill extractor/injector ad
---
Please not this friggin video again!
---
I would want to know more about it then.
---
What was it for then?
---
As if the entire North won't join in at every opportunity.  
---
The North has come to help Frat in this war many times.  
---
Before that The North worked with Fraternity to invade our space, ending in the battle of UALX.  
---
Before that The North tried to set up in Providence, our Northern neighbor.  
---
Which they mostly did because their months long deployments in 0-SHT and Jamunda on the Catch border failed to make any progress.  
---
It wasn't long before that that they evicted us from Vale.  
---
And it wasn't long before that when TEST alone tried to invade Delve, but panfam had no interest in going after goons.
---
This about as accurate as it gets i guess lmao
---
hey, it's classic
---
It only matters so fucking dickhead trolls, or leet pvpers in a spaceship pixel game you fucking twat
---
Still waiting for SOE Capitals.
---
A non-cloaky ship wouldn't catch bots that much as they rat prealigned. As the bot hunter you would still need to rely on logoff traps and guessing their warpback timer, which is already the status quo.
---
You need a cloaky ship with 0 recalibration time. The trade off can be only 60 seconds local delay and literally 0 damage. There are still counters to it like eyes on gates, watching intel networks, cyno, capital umbrellas, etc.
---
You know you are failing when you have to teach basic fleet concepts in alliance update

The Soltueur model was pre-capital era and was probably not very much bigger than an Erebus currently is. It was way offscale compared to the lore sketches.

yes, instrumental and vital NPC hit preaty hard. If it's to much for you, land your(s) pve ship in the gaz site before the npc came.

If you can kill at least 1 BS quikly, you should be OK for the rest of the site. (mainty used this trick for Vital)
---
Test is lots of talk. Then a few ally updates how elite they wre. Then when shit dosnt advance they stab somone in the back and call it a win.
---
China ain't a race dumbass
---
its harder to find a seller than it is to grind the isk for a moracha
---
Congratulations, you managed to bring the eve community together with this post.
---
what a waste of food
---
2 years? I think we will See this in 3 months

Thank god for China

It's because it's so versatile. It can perform almost any job you want, so naturally it comes to mind a lot when you need a new ship for something.

I know the whole grrr NCdock meme hate etc but TAPI is def not richer than NC. lmao

If TAPI gives up on legacy, the rest of the coalition will 100% be minced into the grinders of *elite pvp*

Is carrier blitzing Level 5 mission still viable after recent fighter nerf?
---
I like that, makes sense in away
---
Thx
---
Extremely happy CCP is worried about Curbing the Brisc Rubal menace and not the harmless, benign botters they brought over from Serenity. After all this is all just the goons fault, all we have to do is take away their titans and the market will fix itself, right?
---
Be lucky if they took anyones income but their own TBH.

For being a cunt.

Most unlikely

you can RMT a moracha for close to $2k so it could be compared to totalling a cheap car

Sig cartel. The only neuts you dont shoot.
---
I totally agree jumping JF in on all off our freaking towers to fuel them is no no no.  
---
But he got one point right before you could evict someone from a region.  By taking all moons.  Now they just drop 100 cheap ass sheds in the system daily and you got no way to counter it.  That’s demoralising.   I think there should be a fixed max number of structures online in a system.  That way you could push someone out. And you could defend against ninja online.  (It should be a setting to turn it on in nullsec by the system overlord).  This would make NPC nullsec without this block and with (hopefully) npc space in all regions we got a entry point for conflict.
---
gl getting a moracha for 300b, you are gonna pay 500b at least and even then the biggest difficulty is actually finding someone willing to sell that shit
---
more like 500b+
---
I don't think CCP will let Serenity die.      
---
One of the reasons why PA bought CCP is to get access to China game market.
---
No sov -&gt; no dammage cap, it would be great
---
It's TEST, are there ANY people there that don't count as deviant
---
salt is not a food
---
Can we not do this
---
I cashed out at 925. Oh well
---
Weirdly, I'd not even heard of them until today (though I'll admit, I'm not exactly what you'd call a deeply enfranchised player).
---
Are you having fun when playing ? If no, change your play style, and if no play style fit you, stop playing. It's as simple as that.
---
funny how it's never, ever test's fault
---
A lot of players crying about decreasing Active players in EVE. Now, when about 2k players want to join to TQ, they are crying about it. What's wrong with this guys?
---
Hi, with a lot of games being free today, games usually get their revenue from the 20%. 80% are not paying and 20% are the one contributing to the sales.
---
However, what if instead of just Alpha and Omega clone, CCP add another clone state in between Alpha and Omega? They still have the 20m skill restriction but the 5m training limit is lifted and they are free to train all the rest of the alpha skills? Let them pay a fraction of the sub fee and of course give them a little bit more but not as Omega's equal.
---
So what I'm hearing is sell a ton of plex and make a fortune?
---
I understand thinking is hard for you so let me help you out.
---
Food:"any nutritious substance that people or animals eat or drink or that plants absorb in order to maintain life and growth."
---
Sodium is a nutrient that is essential for a lot of animals, us included.
---
Salt is a food.
---
I hope your feeling better.
---
They must do like you say, use asymetric warfare, krab in peace while deploying all squad sig in FRT space, cloaky camp. strat op only when it is important
---
The damage cap mostly kicks in when nullsec powers are involved i imagine. 
---
But it does also matter in other spaces. You have to factor those in, in some way.       
---
Leave damage cap as is except for nullsec?         
---
Remove damage cap everywhere except for sov holders?       
---
Now that we have diminishing returns for reps, maybe that formular can be adapted for a more flexible form of damage cap?
---
yeah, dropping revs on t1 frigs is way more fun.
---
Wow, that's a one in a hundred. Sadly I only ever meet the guys with two orthrus and a curse
---
CCP doesn't run serenity, netease does.
---
I welcome our Chinese overlords. I'm getting quite rich, bought ton of extractors while they were cheap, selling injectors now that they are not.
---
Cha-ching!

just upvote

But if you add up all the renters! /s
---
Not all who wave the jolly roger flag are elite. There are a lot of novice pirates out there, and also a few, whose performances are, by some weird phenomena, gets lowered while being drunk.
---
Pvping in lowsec still makes a man at least a small hero of the day.
---
Nice battle and battle report by the way, welcome back ingame!
---
It's true. Everyone else was too busy krabbing. I mean, they were tired after sitting, logged off, in X47, letting everyone else do the work.
---
\*you're
---
Glorious. Welcome back.
---
Just hit the little x button on the top right, looks beautiful when you do
---
Because they don't want to bother building it and most likely are not familiar with the latest hardware anyway.
---
It takes a good amount of research to come up with a better system than a decent prebuilt.
---
Unless you already know that stuff. But i think *most* people with the know how do it themselves anyway.
---
me too but imperium has totally forgotten that.
---
Its so sad you can't enjoy it as much if you speak german..
---
Salt is mineral that is required for many organisms to exist and function. Based on your statement oxygen is food.           
---
    
---
Salt itself don't provide any nutritious substance what more salt is toxic and can easy lead even to your death if overdosed
---
Unironically PGL is worse than that
---
And what they have done wrong? interesting to know because old brave was the old goon spirit : zerg with mass frig t1 without giving a shit about the loss, and i like this spirit ;)
---
Thank god i left this game.   CCP drove it into the group out of greed
---
This and the fuckin spanish guy with no teeth sayin it true.
---
&gt; And what they have done wrong?
---
I mean, that's debatable.  I'd say it's not picking a direction.  They're no longer the best at recruiting newbies.  They're not focused on building a super force like TEST did.  They're not a *constant fleets* alliance like BL.  They're just kind of... there.
---
It's like the alliance is in maintenance mode until their permanent leadership comes back.  If that's Cagali's role, he's doing a good job of it.
---
Sodium is a essential nutrient by definition.
---
Oxygen isnt a food because people dont eat or drink oxygen.
---
Anything can lead to death if overdosed on.
---
"We are big, capable, dedicated, resourceful, and talented."
---
PA dosent have any better access to china than CCP does.
---
Purge avery
---
First time on reddit?
---
considering this amount of salt costs about 0,03 we can assume it will not be missed
---
I'm running an i8086k, 32g ram, nvidia 1080 graphics card pushing two 4k, a 2k and a 1080p monitor.  I run three clients in the \*k monitors.  I turn vsync on and run all three, no issues.  The 1080p is for discord/mumble/etc stuff.
---
That may or may not help you, I am just happy about my setup and wanted to brag a little\* ;)
---
\*i'm sure other folks have better computers than I do, but I'm happy with mine.
---
They'll come, but they will definitely be neutral.
---
really classic, can't believe I can see it here~
---
Also very famous in China with many different versions. 
---
The video is a nice work and I mean no offensive to tapi or pgl.
---
Attacking would be impossible
---
&gt; That sounds like you need a better bunch of people to fly with to keep it interesting Did you know Dreddit is recruiting?
---
The irony in this statement is just the best.
---
It's TEST vs the universe again, everyone!
---
No, you are wrong. The best way is get more BOT and RMT workshops in GOONS and Rus, let the Bots competition to death.
---
And why the fuck do you think Chinese are bots? Would you like a visit to FRT?
---
We made a hype video of this structure and the upcoming citadels back in the days. if you like to see a video version of this structure: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-MY20VUOjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-MY20VUOjg)
---
It's always the north vs the south.  Has been for a long time.
---
Probably too edgy for him.
---
China and Korea are different countries brohan
---
Thank you Mynxee :) I enjoyed you as CEO.
---
I'm trying my best. Lol
---
Look at this shit...he got partnered : [https://imgur.com/TlW5FNv](https://imgur.com/TlW5FNv)
---
He did it, the absolute madlad, he did the SALT meme!
---
Dumbos will dumb on fleets, news at 11
---
Lowsec FW citadel defense could also be FW sov based?
---
Not sure about the other places? Maybe add a sort of collective sov protection the attacker can chip at, at which point all citadels become vulnerable?
---
As a whole, we could move everything from shooting at a structure to messing with activity in the system.
---
And the eagle and Mach price are damn decling, although TEST and XIX feed so so many.
---
Yeah Panfam is just waiting for you feed a few more eagle fleets before coming down to toast Esoteria, you nailed it bud
---
Why is it goons fault
---
You say that like it's not true.  Panfam would let Frat do the toasting and would just *be there* to keep our fleets in check.
---
meh, we have fun in the game, its not super elite pvp, but the fun/hr is high!
---
Attack from npc station
---
Well it's everywhere
---
&gt;Maybe once your leadership comes out of it's victim complex, and build up some testicular fortitude you can chart a more independent course and go for the top spot, but for now your leadership is happy to be number 2 pretending they're number 10 or 11 leaving people confused and apathetic.
---
TEST leadership dancing monkey dance

Well Great fire wall is truly working.
---
Is that not 300b+? Pretty sure you’re just being pedantic for no reason?
---
50 shades of blue
---
Lol, what a shame. It's my buddy. Gonna troll him for such a dumb loses.
---
just say 1isk+ then 
---
its technically correct using your way of thinking 
---
you won't find a moracha for sale for less than 500b unless you get some total bro deal
---
Chinese Will have a hard time buying them right now haha now they bought like 600 People over from Serenity but they don't have the isk for buying those yet.  Until they go botting. 
---
We need to fix the economy though this is getting way out of hand like the Plex prices.
---
Compared to what sp cost to produce with the current Level of plex prices, they are still too cheap
---
May be CCP can totally stop solo ratting mechanism. I think keep the Sansha/Gusitas/Blood invasions as the main isk source is the best way. To gain ISK, this requires player to work as a team, and also cautious about the coming PVP.
---
I remember in WOW, killing 1000 turtles brings you nothing, all rewards com from killing a BOSS.
---
&gt; but the fun/hr is high!
---
Brave already coined that cringeworthy term.
---
Everything is our fault remember?
---
I suppose you're right, but it's a decent money investment for entertainment purposes.  It's worth the research anyways.
---
how dare they give us an extra line of d-scan for humanitarian purposes
---
wrong reason to be mad at them imo, say you'd rather have bling battleships self destruct and you have a point
---
doesn't mean that it doesn't apply. sorry if people are enjoying playing the game maybe you should try it, did you know [Dreddit is recruiting?](https://dredditisrecruiting.com) we can help you find the joy of playing video games again. or you can go back to being bitter about everything.
---
Agree with this entirely. I'm a rather shit pilot and pirate, but I try anyway. More the bumbling comedic type than the 'will rape all your women and teabag your corpse' type.
---
Injector prices are directly linked to Plex prices.
---
explain to me why ( im no goon by the way)
---
&gt; also a few, whose performances are, by some weird phenomena, gets lowered while being drunk.
---
Ah who the what now? You lost me here.
---
That's what goons are *for*
---
Damn. Yea we need to fix the economy or ccp needs to step in and lower the prices or something
---
More reports like this people.
---
This is how you AAR.
---
FC makes a bad call, everyone dies, 'omg how are you guys so bad at this game, you better step up or I just wont bother running fleets'
---
&gt; WHY IS MORALE PLUMMETING!??!?!?!
---
It's a running joke that's been going for over a decade. We are the reason all the bad stuff happens, even though for the most part it's not our fault, least directly.
---
Swapped all my alts into skillfarm mode months ago, looking like an increasingly good decision atm
---
Everything is toxic in the right amount
---
I'm unsure why you're surprised. This is the same amount of stamina they showed in Geminate.
---
New monitor(s) are definitely something I would like to do, but I think that might be down the line a ways so my wife doesn't murder me.
---
A true pirates abilities increase according to the amount of rum he has drank. It is known.
---
QUALITY shitpost! OMG!
---
Oh ok didnt know that. Haha Proxy wars backed by goons   Goon backed rebels
---
All you dinobrains post the same dumb shit.
---
superb eve music
---
How many bots can it run? 50?
---
Like the pre hyped blue ball ops?
---
Haha my stories usually go the same way... with me getting killed by some ships I've never heard of.
---
No matter how long the break, we always come back to New Eden...
---
GRRR people having fun in my online misery simulator
---
Which one? And from which side of the war? Let's not pretend for a moment that both sides aren't guilty of this.
---
Size of fleets will impact this as well. The reason smaller groups are "elite PVP" isn't because they are inherently better at the game. I believe it's because a group of less than 100 dudes who constantly play a video game together generally are willing to do everything right. You don't want to be the guy to let your "battle brother" down. 
---
When I was in SC or Snuff I knew pretty much every one in fleet by name. When I was in BL and NC. I cared less and went "maximize killmails" more often.
---
not all of lowsec is FW though.
---
They now have mobile apps that cater to them.  :)  Those didn't exist  before for old people like us, and Snake doesn't count.
---
Non lowsec FW can probably get a different treatment yeah. I know very little about that environment though.
---
My costs have stayed the exact same since I started playing.
---
I think too, most places require it so the people on fleets can get a pap link, or srp for any losses.
---
Allied yes, but Fire is as much as Panfam is Winter Coalition. With the only difference, that we both actually live right next to the front
---
&gt; Generally I think if you find yourself telling people they need to stop being shit or some euphemistic variation on a regular basis then the problem lies with the FCs rather than the fleet members.
---
I think it also has a lot to do with the culture of an alliance. Some alliances almost seem to take pride in being "bad at videogames", so it doesn't surprise me that those same alliances are having relatively more trouble with simple things like 'pressing f1 at the right time'.
---
The formatting here actually hurt me in places I didn't know I had.
---
&gt; It's TEST, are there ANY people there that don't count as deviant
---
If enough people are deviant, they form the new normal.
---
Frat, a primarily CNTZ alliance, would be toasting TEST, a firmly USTZ alliance? The TEST persecution complex can apparently bend the very fabric of space and time.
---
This is your brain on reddit
---
Wait, so you have to hate someone IRL to shoot them in a video game?
---
I guess I need to move to HS and be a carebear since I don't actually dislike anyone in EVE...
---
7o You guys have done excellent work!
---
&gt; Well blame the mouth breathing dev that thought damage caps (that weren't there to stop structures being RFed in 60 seconds) + auto repairs instead of defenders repairing + set windows instead of the still solid stront bays of towers and finally no natural cap to limit the number of structures per system was a good idea.
---
It's like they took all the good things of the old system and put them in the trash.
---
What is this material required for?
---
Yes that worked very well for Goons in Saranen after WWB. Most of valuable nullsec, especially staging systems, are not in range of NPC space.
---
After playing this game for years, it comes as no surprise to me that whenever the weather gets warmer, the titties come out, up-skirt photographers and cinematographers take on more projects and fleet numbers drop. It happens so naturally it's like the tides.
---
All of the Triglavian ships
---
Triglavian ship construction, which should be in demand _especially_ given we're expecting new T2 versions of existing Triglavian ships.
---
Thanks for clarifying
---
Jita Scammers have alliances now? Great.
---
10 minutes a day? I used to PI and get about 1 bil a month, but it involved at least an hour a day, mostly flying around. After a couple of months of this I gave up. No fun.
---
&gt; As soon as a side (no matter which) clearly show weakness, they are endangered to become evicted. Always was and always will be, for the simple reason: Entertainment and power-showoff. Everybody wants to join the winning team, noone the losing team. So the pendulum can swing extremely fast.
---
If any offensive action that TAPI makes is a potential life or death scenario, then why does TAPI even bother doing anything?
---
You probably think you are pretty smart, but your line of reasoning is so dumb if you consider that the top 2 alliances in the game, which together outnumber the rest of the game in fleet size and amount of supers/titans, are blue to each other.
---
&gt;If you are playing bad, and bloody the water, you will always become the victim.
---
There are plenty of alliances in EVE that are bad but also doing fine. Only test is perpetually playing the victim card, and it's laughworthy.
---
Adding this to my collection...
---
Yeah, my skill level goes up to a point when I drink because I stop over analyzing things.
---
To a point.
---
grr gons.
---
7o! You guys have done capital work!
---
Welcome back and well played!
---
TAPI line members would like to have a word with you.
---
For 87 months running! I'd call that the flavor of the decade.
---
“Do you wanna grab some food” “No thanks, I brought some salt”...
---
As someone who played this game  for years it comes as no surprise at this time of year. When the weather gets warmer, the titties come out, and every logi FC out there thinks he is an upskirt cinematographer. And fleet numbers drop. It's like the tides. Fleet numbers ebb and flow depending on titties.
---
O wow another armchair economists salt post about chinese
---
One good idea is to kidnap a CCP dev, male him sit in a fleet that gonna bash said structures and kill them for that one week and stare ay him and say “Look and feel the pain for ONE system, NOW , look at the region and tell me, how much this is gonna suck”
---
Jita Scammers have alliances now? Great!
---
Yeah I find the number of people who left the game but still lurk this subreddit amazing.
---
Boosh comp uses different keep at ranges, but it's definitely keep at it's not orbit for most stuka/retri/purifier type boosh fleets.
---
I mean, yes offensive wars in the current eve online suck; however, given the alliance and all of the great calls its leadership has been making lately, are you surprised? 
---
TEST might as well disband tbh.
---
Just warp around to the Muvolailen system and bring it in through that gate.  Dont pass through Perim.  The Muvo gate is straight above the station and lands you about 1km from dock.
---
350m isnt all that much to get worked up over if you have even a moderate buffer tank fitted.  If youre worried, you can plate it up and brick tank it.  Its the 1500 ehp faith tanked ships that get Tornadoed.
---
Yeah I must’ve hallucinated the PHORDE/BL gotg invasion
---
With 3-4 Bombers you will need to target paint the drones or none will die.
---
The space Scot in me saw the part about poorly stocked markets and the isk making opportunity makes me think it's time to make a newbro BRAVE alt and go stock that damn market!
---
Getting their roams stomped on.
---
See, you need to tell her they were on *sale*.  works every time.
---
I am very fortunate that my wife has always supported all of my hobbies, even to buying all my monitors.  She's sort of holding the line on upgrading that last 2k to a 4k, but I'll get it eventually.  :)
---
I've seen the kills with only 3 bombers on them. I have not done it with less than 5 personally. Do you need 1 or 2 paints per drone when it is 3 x covop 5?
---
Unless ur gas mining. Then it's OK
---
Wait, how do you kill them without a tackle?
---
And how did the stiletto hold you if he was in the Oracle that first showed up?
---
Yup but my buddy Nazeem did once.
---
Fold everything into one MegaAlliance called CHINA #1
---
Done... solved all out problems, and now we can mine in peace.
---
Get at it brother!!! 😁
---
You do realize that it´s not CCP setting the price for those items? Okay, they kind of are, but the extractor price hasn´t changed.
---
by the time it releases, the ships in the game will be outdated versions of the real-life ships we'll be flying around the galaxy in
---
The gallente had 8 off them. one was stolen by the sapentis though

A blockade runner is going to insta-cloak on every warp.  Doubt even remote sensor boosted Tornadoes will get a shot off unless you are 150% on the ball and have lightning fast reflexes/good very low latency.
---
Never used a DST so no comment.
---
The shitposting is too good.
---
Why not just make ur own?
---
I wouldn't put all your horses on that one. The longer PvE is in a game the better people get at farming it (or perhaps the better bots get at farming it). The new ships look kinda underwhelming too.
---
You belong to the greatest team in the world I hope you appreciate it Elder.

I feel sorry for the people that need to buy them, but my wallet sure is happy about it.

---
Yes, because running them on net negative is good.
---
&gt;coalitionsin.space
---
we usually call it ncpl or something
---
And yet, it's still a net negative to run a injector farm.
---
We at DNG gain more dps per alcohol to blood content.
---
CCP made it cancerous to copy them.  It can still be done, but only 10 bms at a time.  I know you can still place them in inventory and in cans and such, and i know for a fact that they are still tradeable.  I just dont know if anyone bothers nowadays.
---
Really, how many people actually fly them?  I injected the skills but haven't trained any of them yet.  I may never unless there's a fleet doctrine including them and that seems unlikely.  The module enhancements are quite overrated too.  I think the whole concept is extremely silly.
---
Why make it so complicated? CCP could just disallow capitals and supercapitals in the sites, straight up, if that's how they wanted to do things.
---
Well it’s been rising lately, and I would definitely expect a spike during the first two-three weeks after release.
---
I already had a good flip with crystallines this month, bought about 80-90k between 160k-190k each and dumped when they rose up to 290k till like 260k/250k.. Now I’m buying in again till the end of May when they release the rest of them.
---
Regardless I’m still 10bil give or take (I don’t do spreadsheet bs but I know I made a huge profit) positive from this flip so even if it doesn’t workout on release date, I’ll still be isk positive as long as I dump them for 200k+
---
Tbh most people who place this game are fucking retarded
---
&gt; **EVE Online**  **is** **breaking**
---
&gt;" Your apathy in rorq mining carelessly is costing us on every level, it's making it worse for everyone else in the alliance, and it makes us look weak and dumb. "
---
Ah hahahahahaha... No Sapporo, it makes you look dumb and weak. Test leadership historically has mad balls apathy for defending its own space, or members. Funny turn of events when the apathy goes the other way, eh Sapporo?
---
&gt;Think to yourself "that makes sense" you are wrong. ...  This kind of last second buffoonery is costing us dearly. 
---
Ah hahahahhaha... They can't fill their alliance contracts cause the market team is too lazy or busy!
---
&gt; Speaking of our markets you may have noticed that our market in 08-N7Q is not great.  Nor is D-PNP9.  The reason for that is we don't have enough people importing goods to put on the market.  We are seemingly relying on people to do that who don't know to do that or don't have that responsibility in their functional division to do that. 
---
Ah hahahahaha... Maybe because your fucking alliance lives in a dozen plus places, eh Sapporo?  Maybe because you stretched your alliance too thin, because you think constant war is good, but move your operations every few months and expect your members to use and move EVERY DOCTRINE under the sun to all dozen of those locations? 
---
Maybe your stretched your Alliance too thin?
---
SO MAYBE ITS YOUR FAULT SAPPORO. THAT YOUR ALLIANCE SUCKS, HMMM???
---
You also have to pay to get them back out of asset safety.

I’ve seen mostly small gangs in Triglavian fleets, not sure if many use them as doctrine tho, if any I’ve noticed mostly wormholers...

The reason that Alpha SP can be given away for free is because it's locked to a single character. Past the 5m SP limit skills can be extracted and sold so the training restriction to the alpha skillset would be ineffective. If Lambda clones are a cheaper way to get SP we'll just see farms of them undercutting Omega profits. Then we face the ugly question of "should Lambda paid skills be locked to the account?" Adding a 3rd option complicates the model considerably.
---
TAPI aggressively (lmao) followed the goons to delve after WWB only to find out the north didn't care enough to come and then they gave up
---
TAPI also ran away from Vale when they **heard** NCPL was coming for them
---
Ans how would you prevent them from going there ? Blowing the ship if it initiate warp toward a combat anomaly ?
---
you have 0 jumps to BPOs?
---
Don´t doubt yourself while you FC. EVER. Even if you feel like you just made a giant mistake, and look ahead for the rest of the fleet.   
---
Once fleet is over its time to recapitulate, find out what/ if you did (something) wrong, and try to find a way to do it better next time. There is no time for second guessing during the fleet, you are just giving the enemy fc time to get one thought process ahead of you.

They haven't truly left the game til they've unsubbed and forgotten about /r/eve
---
The industry is dumber and there were far fewer sharks in the pond. 
---
People also don't want to hear it but, the skill system is fucking radioactive as far as 99% of potential players are concerned. Everyone I've ever introduced to the game, with one exception, quit or refused to continue on after getting a grasp of how the skill system works. Numerical % advantages are complete cancer. Not only do you have no idea what you're doing, but you're also at a mathematical disadvantage, and it's not a small one. 
---
EVE players love to pretend it doesn't matter. It does. It matters a whole fucking lot.

Yer crew of scurvy seadogs cant man the wheel, tend to the sheets, and run the guns if theyre too blarneyed to walk straight.

i think its hilarious u kids talking shit about Mitani. u wouldnt say this shit to him at delve, hes jacked. not only that but he wears the freshest clothes, eats at the chillest stations and hangs out with the hottest dudes. yall are pathetic lol.
---
I stick around just in case I see something miraculous happen and makes me wanna actually play again.
---
while i fairly like this kind of post cause he's right ... it would have been easier to enable Vincemode and just DD the shit out of guys who cant do shit right 5 times a row... 
---
I mean every alliance in the game have those guys not being aligned taking the wh without a reason or command and so on... 
---
And to all who say it is a game i just want to have fun ... so i didnt want that ship anyway.... you should think about just going back to highsec and do missions. This egomaniac behavior just show you dont care about anything regarding the alliance you joined.
---
This is why i like the kind Vince is handling NC and announces to stop being shit.
---
LMAO. Looking at the damage I can see why they couldn't take you alone. They ate shit to the fucking site rats.
---
I think I have been misunderstood. The training speed is of course relative to the money paid to CCP. If the sub cost half the omega, the training speed of course need to cut half as well. It’s just a poor man sub, to put it another way.
---
Call it alpha+ sub.
---
Jeez, didn't know things were this bad for TEST
---
It's almost like they aren't a try hard alliance for new players.
---
You call for help, you are dead before people are halfway there because you are in a VNI and most risk averse ratter hunters gang up into groups to minimize the risks to themselves. A cyno on a VNI is a assured death sentence as you lose all your transversal to the rats.
---
&gt;Local is an extremely lazy way of intel.
---
Being immune to reprisal is a very lazy way of hunting. Cloaking is already a 100% safe mechanic to abuse as it is, you want to add either permanent or temporary local immunity meaning that you can be 200% safe all the time or at least long enough to get safed up every time.
---
But honestly, out of all the gaming Reddit’s I’ve been on, this one is the most amusing one, so I wouldn’t really blame anyone for sticking around hahaha
---
I don't fully understand what you're trying to spin here.
---
&gt;if any offensive action that TAPI makes is a potential life or death scenario, then why does TAPI even bother doing anything?
---
Because it's fun.
---
&gt;There are plenty of alliances in EVE that are bad but also doing fine. Only test is perpetually playing the victim card, and it's laughworthy
---
Sappo's point, which I absolutely agree with, is that FRT and friends are fully capable of evicting us if we keep fucking up.  Noreaus has stated in the past the "he's not going to go AFK until he takes Test's space."
---
&gt;You probably think you are pretty smart, but your line of reasoning is so dumb if you consider that the top 2 alliances in the game, which together outnumber the rest of the game in fleet size and amount of supers/titans, are blue to each other
---
We're not necessarily blue. We have a mutual defensive pact in place that does not include the people we're currently fighting, and we work together to shoot Panfam.
---
There is no guarantee whatsoever that if we get in trouble with FRT that goons would help, and it would be foolish for us to assume they will.
---
I'm not sure why we can't respect the dudes we're fighting against without people trying to spin it.
---
Thank you. All better.
---
The shit posts are invaluable. Like all the HyperJumpGrandmaster posts and the god tier shitposter that is NazAlGhul. 10/10 would suck his dick. No homo
---
hat gons
---
Same with anyone Scottish. Add some juice into the mix and combat effectivity increases up until a point.
---
Just watch it muted.  pretty dank.
---
Well, who is doing alright, but is bad? The alliances I counted, are not...
---
And that is why I asked: "Do you even play Nullsec?"
---
Numbers of titans, numbers of players etc are just that, numbers on a list. These also have to be used effectively. And people simply might not log in/leave to other alliances if there is a long consistent lose streak. Thinking it's not like that is only one thing: NAIVE.
---
If CCP truly cared about the PLEX price they would put it on sale. I don't believe that they care that it is a 4.1 mil right now.
---
genolution implants. 6 slot speed implant. zor's custom hyper link. speed drugs.
---
Wait, so Test, an imperial pet, is scared of a bot alliance?
---
Do they think that bots will outfight them? Could be a good summer war
---
PvP game somehow equals "You're required to PVP on every character, in every corp" now?
---
Not if you already stocked up on extractors when they were cheaper.
---
"the entire north" 
---
thats 25k dudes, Legacy is 35k Imperium is 50k 
---
Really hard war for you guys
---
High prices on their own are good for CCP, they encourage more people to buy plex with RL$, which nets CCP more profit than subscriptions. 
---
High prices also crowd out multiboxers, but in terms of "people who matter to eve" players who plex 30 rorq accounts aren't high on the list - they don't generate content or pay real money. The real damage is in crowding out smaller players from countries where the subscription cost is too high, like turkey or venezuela, but single-account players aren't as heavily affected by plex prices.
---
By physically preventing them from initiating a warp to the anomaly. Or putting an acceleration gate on it, though that one has downsides for hunting people in anomalies.
---
Bruh I’m not the one stripping my characters to pay for my losses.
---
Ok.
---
And SkillU, Laserhawks, Quiet etc!!
---
bad gons.
---
Lelob I see you with that bait in the water. 😎
---
Bruh I'm not stripping anything. I was for about 4 hours. Then I said fuck that.
---
That seems so long ago.
---
have you ever heard PGL in comms?\`It shouldn't be hard to understand why no one understand wtf he wants them to do.
---
My favourite is the failed dreadbomb where he was screaming for his dread fc to call targets while screaming lots un unnecessary stuff on comms, preventing the dread fc to call targets, leading to him screaming at him for not calling targets
---
When do we get to start seeing some Chinese Eve memes?
---
Mainly to mitigate the cost of plex, since I don't really need to keep training most of my chars. But it does mean I got the SP for cheaper than it is now, and will turn a profit - although I could've made the same profit just buying injectors at 800 mil a pop around christmas.
---
nc. doesn't really have much more than 100 on fleets unless supers are formed
---
incredible video quality. what are your OBS settings? :D
---
That seems smart.
---
Dreddit is literally one of the worst corps in Test to join. If you want "a better bunch of people" you need to find a corp where you won't just be random linemember #2435

As someone that just recently got back into Eve...can't tell if joking.
---
If you're not joking I'm imaging a Jersey Shore commercial coming out of your mouth, and imaging you think that's a good thing.
---
Jesus christ is that a 14 gig zip of literally every portrait? Do you know if the files are named in any searchable manner?
---
Without people buying PLEX with ingame money from other players there would be noone buying PLEX from CCP. So the Rorquals are pretty important to CCP too. More important than people generating c0nTEnT
---
They are indexed by `character_id` and Yes.
---
Cool nice opinion you got there, have you actually been in dreddit, and bothered to get integrated and interact with your corp members? Because if you had you would have realised its not like that at all, the only people who feel like linemember #1337 are the people who don't bother to put the effort in to get to know people. 
---
i assume you are one of the people who turn up to party where you don't know anyone ... sit in the corner and try not to make eye contact then go home and bitch about how everyone hates you and is super unfriendly.
---
We had a wormhole open in our pocket and a guy was coming out in a Tempest and a tackle inty I warped my Mach down to the gate he would come through (wh was 2J out) and he went back into his WH with the Tempest but his interceptor stuck around orbiting the gate at 50-ish so I thought if I let myself get draged off the gate he might come back in something different. Burned after the Ceptor and sure enough a Leshak gets reported and jumps in a few seconds later. Got tackle on the Leshak warped in a Carrier and blapped him. It surely wasn't the most honorable thing to do but it was a nicely executed bait in my opinion.
---
Yes, and that guy would explain to them that the only way to lower the isk price of PLEX would be to 
---
- A : remove skill extractors from the game
---
- or B : lower the PLEX RL price
---
both of which would hurt CCP more than less alphas being able to PLEX their accounts.
---
It’s objectively false that players who plex 30 accounts don’t pay ‘real money’ if the demand for plex wasn’t there it wouldn’t be worth as much and also in game items wouldn’t be as relatively cheap. 
---
It’s a assumption lots of people make. But if the autistic multiboxers and big consumers of plex went away both the value of plex would drop and the cost of I game items would rise. Both which are disincentives for people to buy plex from ccp and thus it would be bad for the game if those people went away.
---
did a little research this dude is shitlord to a corp with 100% taxes lol
---
this is probably on of the most retarded spins ever in r/Eve

Alliance numbers means fuck all if you don't get people in fleet.

---
you are wrong... check vince draken Soundboard.... every alliance have this kind of players fucking shit up cause they dont care. I also already lost ship's cause not paying attention and falling behind while traveling. I then just keep my mouth shut, die in peace and dont file for srp cause you know my mistake is not the problem of my alliance.

---
Chinese memes require biggest of brain to comprehend.
---
the goal post were literally sat by Sapporo, he was talking about fleet numbers
---
No one cares about your alliance numbers, they don't matter. What matters are the people that actually logs in and gets in fleet.
---
Going just as great as their deployment north! Guess its time to rotate further south
---
Yeah, to bad they fired that guy.
---
shhhhhhh dont ruin the fun when the FC is the only one not getting booshed :)
---
Going to assume this is a troll.
---
Since a couple of months they have a new, foreign Economist and he's red in the face, screaming and jumping through the office but noone seems to be able to understand him. 
---
**플렉스가** **너무** **비싸다!**
---
Well apperently they are still outfighting them
---
Perhaps they torp'd or painted with that few(?) Not sure, but 3 is almost not doable from my experience.  
---
I believe if everyone has cov ops 5 then you only need 1 paint, but ideally you'd want each bomber to have 2 paints so you can spread between drones.
---
&gt; if the demand for plex wasn’t there it wouldn’t be worth as much and also in game items wouldn’t be as relatively cheap
---
Well, lemme rephrase that. When plex's isk prices crashes to 250m/month, CCP will care a lot more about plex consumers. Right now, there's just far more consumers than buyers. So losing some consumers by incentivizing buyers isn't a huge deal - plex use goes down because prices go even higher. 
---
CCP definitely cares if a rorq 30boxer quits the game for *reasons unrelated to plex prices*, because that reduces plex price while providing no benefit. But if some of them get crowded out by the plex spike, that's just a cost of doing business, and the impact is still a net profit for CCP.
---
Yes, how? Unless... OP was the pirate all along killing their VNI. :thinking:
---
Me too. Every now and then I get a sudden urge to play or some cool memory hops in to my mind randomly. Kinda like when you quit smoking and you get that weird subliminal thingy going on. Or it might be the first sympthom of going insane lol.
---
TAPI can form multiple subcap fleets, NC. struggles to fill one, even with hyped prepings. 
---
They have a tiny supercap advantage, which is getting smaller every day. But these days you need to win the subcap war, not just the supercap war. 
---
PANFAM vs Legacy would be nearly the same numbers, subcap and supercap. I would rate them pretty much on the same level power wise. 
---
Raw numbers are 40k for legacy and 35k for PANFAM (much of that is B0T which is purely renters and wont form for a war)
---
“Remember when CCP had an Economist to manage Market fluctuation?”
---
Dude: when there was still such a thing as ‘Aurum’ (remember that?) Dr. Eyo had his economics talk at Fanfest. Currrent state of ISK, explanation, graphics. Current state of PLEX, explanation, graphics, charts, what have you.
---
Not.
---
A.
---
Word.
---
on Aurum.
---
-Nothing-
---
So, I get up at the mic in the big room and I ask [words to that effect] “You mentioned ISK and PLEX, but you didn’t mention Aurum a single time. What’s going on?”
---
Dr. Eyo: “It’s not where we wanted it to be.”
---
End of story.
---
/True story. I was there. I did ask the question.
---
it doesn't really matter since logi still applies.  regardless of the cap, there's a huge wave of regen when the logis complete lock and activate reps.  The whole point of alpha doctrine is to kill the target in one shot so they can't be repped.
---
With weaker logi, they can't hold against as much DPS, but you still need to fight their reps.  With alpha they're a non-factor.
---
Makes it harder to do if I am doing all 3! Maybe just need 1 more cov op 5 bomber. Need to kill those miners.
---
Subsidizing your sub with skill extracting on alts that don't need training is just smart.
---
Tapi is definitely not richer than NC. 
---
You have to remember most NC. players have played for 5+ years, most Tapi members have played less than that. 
---
When looking at numbers (for economic reasons) you also need to add B0t, which is a 5k renter alliance, and WERMT, which is a lot of NC. alts + some renters. A renting alliance brings in more ISK than your own members would through tax.
---

---
Yesterday was not the best day. Today is better, more clear headed, and will be logging in tonight. Please no vonhole night terrors Eve God's. tia
---
its a copypasta
---
The problem here being that it's necessarily a bad thing that alphas can't just blitz to subscriptions.
---
If we look at it from a business standpoint, it makes no sense for CCP to reduce the barrier to entry for alphas to use in-game currency to PLEX. Sure, yes, someone else has to spend the money to place it into the universe, but I bet the number of frustrated alpha players who decide "fuck it, I'm gonna just buy the sub" is sufficient that no specific motivation exists for CCP to make PLEX easier to access through gameplay alone.
---
&gt; I don't fully understand what you're trying to spin here.
---
I'm not 'trying' to spin anything here, I am not even playing the game anymore. I am just saying that the TAPI narrative of Test as the perpetual victim is super dumb if you spend more than 2 seconds thinking about it.
---
&gt;We're not necessarily blue.
---
Yeah right.
---
&gt;Honestly, how long would you think PL, PH and SkillU would wait until they start pile in to evict TEST if TEST would lose a significant part of their super fleet?! I guess, it's a week tops.
---
Goons would bail them out.
---
you should find an alliance with better leadership then
---
I played since 2003 until I uninstalled 1,5 years ago. As much I want to leave I just can't, Eve is part of me as is this sub...

F for this fallen hero
---
&gt; That, while it looks like a new norm, it still is a deviance off of the accepted norm.
---
Until it no longer is a deviance but rather the new norm.
---
every alliance should have a GigX tbh, imagine all the drama and wars that would happen
---
&gt; I am just saying that the TAPI narrative of Test as the perpetual victim is super dumb if you spend more than 2 seconds thinking about it.
---
Maybe. That's not the case here though, and that's obivious if you spend more then 2 seconds thinking about it, and don't have a narritive to spin.
---
&gt;Yeah right.
---
You know what? You're right. When it comes to shooting Panfam, we're pretty consistently blue.
---
&gt;It's also what allows us to sell titans to members for &lt; 50b and supers for 12b
---
Prices in the north right now are 45 for avatars and 10 for nyxes, guess renting isn't that bad after all
---
will they rotate further south in the end?
---
Yeah, some even consider lowsec fights piracy.
---
test is the new DRF, too much space, only krabs, no one wants to pvp, afk leadership that only comes on to scream or post rant post like this
---
Let's be honest, 9/10 accounts being PLEXed are veterans who have good enough isk making activities to PLEX their accounts. Any alpha actually looking to maintain their account through PLEX has a lot of time to dedicate to it.
---
imagine if you actually believe this
---
Thank you for asking that question.
---
&gt; Maybe. That's not the case here though, and that's obivious if you spend more then 2 seconds thinking about it, and don't have a narritive to spin.
---
Whatever dude, believe what you want to believe.
---
I plan to do some solo low sec pvp in carrier. I know that a cap cant take a gate if pointed by HIC, but can he dock in NPC station while pointed by HIC? With the focused warp disrupter of course
---
when its happening more in your alliance then the enemy there is something else going on though
---
It isnt difficult, it takes up time I would rather be spending  doing something else.   Trash this account too and make another one.
---
Bless you! I always wanted to retrieve the old protrait of my main char.
---
approach for booshing?
---
You want booshers to keep at range 500/1000 and rest of fleet at 1500/2500 if you're doing booshing. Approach is retarded for that use
---
A good dude.
---
I think so, I saw a while ago someone was selling gate tacks to legacy space, I think he was selling them for like 75 mil per region.
---
approach for Booshing is doing it the wrong way.
---
If you don't believe that FRT and friends are capable of taking our space, you haven't been playing Eve very long, or your too wrapped up in your own spin.
---
XIX was 100% un-evictable at one point.  Now the dudes who evicted them are friends with an alliance who has stated they want to evict us.
---
Eve generates the best stories and propaganda.  /r/Eve is like following your alma mater's football team.
---
numbers do usually taper off during summer, but they're usually highest in winter, and this winter has had decade-low numbers.  The PCU is dipping as expected but from a peak that didn't happen this year.
---
Back when plex was 1.5 bil I plexed myself pretty easily just VNI ratting. With anom nerfs, VNI nerfs, and increased prices, that’s not really feasible for a new player anymore. 
---
Sure, there is exploration, but getting good isk/hr with that requires a covops cloak to start with and a lot of practice. You can’t take an alpha with a heron and no idea what’s going on and make easy isk the same way you can just hop in a VNI and print money.
---
where will you rotate to next?
---
The only vulnerable point for a br is when they don't land at 0 on station.
---
I remember my brother's had an issue, and it really wasn't that bad.  Not enough to make me regret it in any shape or form.
---
Did you miss the part where I said barebones and where the real markups are?  My entire 6 core was cheaper than that.
---
I started an alpha account and plexed by going to providence region and taking advantage of nrds rules to tether on citadels and scan anoms in safety without a cloak
---
I used to PLEX with VNI 2 yearsish ago and it was cancer as fuck to rat for 20h+ a month. It worked because I was a student and I could somewhat afk VNI farm + study but that ended pretty fast.
---
I feel that if the Chinese are going to migrate over to TQ, that full integration requires they start shitposting and posting dank memes/propaganda on reddit.
---
&gt; And we’re the good guys.
---
Indeed we are.
---
Its not an opinion, its a fact that you're not a close group when you have hundreds of members. 
---
You will never know most of the people in Dreddit, and if you have a group of say 30-40 dudes you know, why not be in a corp with just that group? 
---
&gt;i assume you are one of the people who turn up to party where you don't know anyone ... sit in the corner and try not to make eye contact then go home and bitch about how everyone hates you and is super unfriendly.
---
I assume you're one of the people who gets triggered by someone talking shit about your corp, and needs to resolve to personal attacks to feel better about yourself
---
*Ahem*...*(whispers)* that's Korean :)
---
Simple Farmers claims to have eyes in all alliances, so more than likely if the claim is true they have eyes in CVA, therefore, they should want to protect Providence in order to create discord and have something to do when Legacy content dries up again. Or possibly they are so neurotic, they basically go insane dropping another 300 content citadels in D-G.
---
Haha that is the plan, but sloooowly :)
---
Just got a new pupper so one thing at a time ;)
---
[The small one is new, Peaches](https://i.imgur.com/syI6ZvG.jpg)
---
Problem is you’re always one Sabre away from losing your ship and all it’s cargo.
---
Not all lowsec fights are piracy. I just wanted to highlight the glory of lowsec combat.
---
&gt; If you don't believe that FRT and friends are capable of taking our space
---
Then maybe you shouldn't have attacked them?
---
Nobody would care about your space if you weren't so fucking annoying.
---
Of those T1 cruisers, vexors are the only viable ones. Fitted for max neutron blaster gank with 3 sentries.
---
2 tornadoes can gank most br if they can lock. 3 for the guaranteed kill. In 0.5 you might get 2 shots out but usually people actually fly the blockage runners gate to gate and insta cloak so if you get a shot, you only get the 1 shot.
---
But why use a T1 cruiser for a gank when a coercer, cormorant, catalyst, or a thrasher does it better for same or cheaper isk? Any of the gank fit T1 dessie should hit 500 dps. 19 seconds \* 500 \* 3 = 28500 damages, that said, count on getting 2/3 of that. 4-5 dessies should do in a tanked br.
---
As far as DST go, they can get up to 100k ehp or so for a full tank setup and they're rarely below
---
Wouldn't mind at all that account status would be visible on r/eve ... shit posts would make way more sense
---
&gt;Then maybe you shouldn't have attacked them?
---
Don't play the game unless you know you can win?
---
You must be NC.
---
&gt;I wouldn't put all your horses on that one. The longer PvE is in a game the better people get at farming it (or perhaps the better bots get at farming it). The new ships look kinda underwhelming too.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Plus it's been on a pretty steady decline since release.
---
It will spike. After that it will level off again. How long will it take for it to level off is anyones guess.
---
Except no. Normalization of deviance deals with situations where there is an objective line of "acceptable" that doesn't move, and a subjective line of "accepted" that does.
---
Silly me, of course it is! 
---
Though, this leaves me with a burning question. How does a Chinese exclamation mark look like?
---
The program "Smith" has grown beyond your control. Soon he will spread through this city, as he spread through The Matrix. You cannot stop him. But I can.
---
&gt;Well it’s been rising lately, and I would definitely expect a spike during the first two-three weeks after release.  
---
&gt;I already had a good flip with crystallines this month, bought about 80-90k between 160k-190k each and dumped when they rose up to 290k till like 260k/250k.. Now I’m buying in again till the end of May when they release the rest of them.  
---
&gt;Regardless I’m still 10bil give or take (I don’t do spreadsheet bs but I know I made a huge profit) positive from this flip so even if it doesn’t workout on release date, I’ll still be isk positive as long as I dump them for 200k+
---
If all you ever do is F1 on command then yea, these are not the ships for you. They require very active and attentive play to begin with, but are also the most fun ships in the game to use, hands down. F1 monkeys, AFK multiboxers and botters need not apply.
---
&gt; If you don't believe that FRT and friends are capable of taking our space, you haven't been playing Eve very long, or your too wrapped up in your own spin.
---
Good job totally missing the point dude. I never said that FRT and friends are not capable of taking your space, and it is a moot point regardless. Your alliance started a war, and are now attempting to paint yourselves as the underdog while everybody knows that when shit truly hits the fan daddy goon will bail you out. Everybody sees through this pathetic veil, except drones like you.
---
The only game I ever played that accurately simulated this effect was the old FPS Redneck Rampage. The health pickups tended to be beer and whiskey, and a little sauce made the game controls way smoother / less jerky, allowing much better aiming. At a certain point, if you kept drinking (out of necessity or by choice) you could no longer see your gun or even walk. However, in an absolutely crucial gameplay mechanic, you could still fire the gun. It blasted in a random direction, occasionally hitting yourself, and it was just barely possible that you would hit your enemy.
---
Why would it be a troll? It is how plex works. There is no point buying PLEX with $$ from CCP if there is no demand from players in game to buy the PLEX from you for ISK.

It looks like it's open season on those mango worshipers.

We are not painting ourselves as the underdog. We are saying that if we keep being shit at the game, we're not going to be able to defend our space from the inevitable counter invasion.

Good job missing the point of Sappo's entire fucking post.
---
And no, Goons are under no obligation to help us out against FRT/skill-u and the majority of the groups attacking us.  Assuming they will would be foolish.
---
Look man, Sappo doesn't really spin. If PGL or Vily wrote that post, ok. There would probably be some spin to read through.
---
But if Sappo writes a post saying that we suck, and we risk losing our space if we don't suck less, it's because he believes we suck and might lose our space if we don't suck less.

---
&gt;Why is it goons fault
---
Goons are really good at the whole economic side of things as well as how to run a large alliance / coalition. Gotta give credit where credit is due. Their recovery after the last time they got kicked to the curb is also quite amazing.
---
Unfortunately, they disproportionately flood Eve Online with too much ISK and too much minerals and caps / supers / titans which is fucking up the game. Also too many alts, AFK miners / ratters that turn into botting either out of boredom or what they feel is necessity etc. All of which is very bad for the game.
---
The initial fault of course lies with CCP, shitty overall game design and their lack of reaction to game breaking mechanics. But after a while, once you know how badly all of it is fucking up the game, if you don't step up and curb it, it does become goons fault at least in a fairly large part.
---
Sure, CCP threw some nerfs and made some anomaly adjustments now, but its way too little and way too late. The damage has been done causing a lot of corps and alliances to disappear from the game as well as a portion of their players who do not find joining any of the blob blocs a good alternative and are not into WHs or HS.
---
CCP really needs to do something much more in order to deplete stockpiles of ISK, plex, minerals, caps and supers in the entire game. This will be unfair for a lot of people who put a lot of hard work into getting these stockpiles, but if it doesn't happen, things will just continue to progress in direction of Serenity. Not as fast, it is relatively slow, but TQ is heading in that direction.
---

I'm getting strong "WTF IS PROTUS" vibes from this post
---
Word on the street is FW is dead. Between the citadels, farmville mechanics and the null sec cancer there is no functioning game mode. This sucks way beyond reason but there doesn't seem to be much interest in fixing it. It may simply be too broken to address at this point.
---
It's only ironic if your head is unironically that far up your own ass.
---
we are at 2B per 500 plex... so this makes sense.
---
&gt;unironically
---
Damn that's a lot of syllables for a dinobrain.
---
Skill injectors are terrible for the game and shouldn't be so easily avalable. Also, they are too expensive.
---
Am I following this right?
---
&gt;Is carrier blitzing Level 5 missions still viable after recent fighter nerf?
---
Very much so, just fit armor and some tracking links.
---
CCP should consider remove local and potentially remove dscan as well. This way, there is almost no way to create a bot with intel. A program will not be able to know when a hunter jump into the system or in warp approaching the target.
---
if they dont like pay money for gaming subscription, why not just buy plex and sell them. Surly you will make a lot of isk from it. BTW why are you even point this out? Are you try to say you dont want to pay real world money to game subscription?
---
Dinobrain.
---
That's a new one.
---
The problem is the same names appear on FC lists today as 5-10 years ago. Which means those 20 year olds have less time to deal with the mundane bullshit this game shovels into your face in order to create content. 
---
I remember spending hours reinforcing POS or POCOs in order to generate a fight that might last 30 minutes. It ain't worth it yo.
---
&gt; eyes on gates
---
Somethings bots do better then people.
---
This will make a fine addition to my collection! &gt;:)
---
The hunter has to take a risk every tackle, it's not that hard to Fit a VNI to hold a hunter for long enough for people to press jump ( about 30 seconds or so ).
---
So there's this gem:
---
&gt;Damn that's a lot of syllables for a dinobrain.

Just brilliant dude, love it. Fun fights, good piloting and chill music.
---
You do a great job spinning for them.
---
Also, still not a coherent thought.
---
why would they want to lower the isk price?
---
Which is exactly my point.
---
So many new players fall into the play-to-pay-to-play fallacy and get butthurt when they aren't making 200mil ticks like all the bittervets... Not even brag about, just remark on, it's normal for them.
---
I wonder how many people are alphas who get no satisfaction from the game whatsoever and JUST think they "know" that plexing/going omega will completely alter their worldview? How many of those inexperienced alphas then fall off the treadmill when they realize that one omega sub they bought did nothing but increase their ticks a bit, and they end up just grinding for ISK because it's all they know?
---

While desktop resolutions may have increased, what resolution we're seeing people play EVE is in still very much 1080p.
---
Data as of yesterday tells us that around 60% of EVE players playing in fullscreen resolution are currently playing at 1920x1080. The majority playing in windowed mode are playing at less than this resolution. A further 22% of players playing in fullscreen are playing at resolutions below 1920x1080.
---
Gaming at resolutions heading toward 4k in EVE is not as widespread as many people would think, mainly due to the use of multiple clients during one game session and the hardware requirements for EVE not being as demanding as most other current games.
---
The story is pretty much the same with windowed mode / windowed fullscreen too - around 50% of people are playing at 1920x1080, and a substantial percentage are playing below that resolution too.
---
40b in assets to do giveaways is not "new" to me.
---
Like i sayd.. all  fine. Community Team will do the Rest. Probally i'm wrong and he does all things EULA conform ;-)
---
Krabs count as 3/5ths of a person.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
We're not doing it wrong...the rest of the game is.  We min max the parameters set by CCP.  We're playing the game as the makers intended.  Get off your lazy butts and utilize the game the way we have.
---
Does that data take into account what resolution is only available in the in-game resolution settings, or constantly the one that is actually being used?
---
EVE Does not save the windowed setting when you close it, so only way to viably play with borders while still having borders is to have the game at non-full monitor resolution on multi-monitor setups. Every time you then simply maximize it for main screen with taskbar and the same for other monitor/s.
---
Offtopic: I should probably post that in the little things thread?
---
indeed.  I'd imagine plex is more multiboxing vets while newer omega players are more the market that sells plex.
---
I could go out, spend $500 on plex to sell, and gain very little "satisfaction" from my money spent.  A newer player could do that, and be like "I CAN BUY AND FLY A SUPER!"
---
He likes to watch.
---
This is actually troubling.
---
I look forward to the future of Moracha's having officer guns too.
---
That's probably the best comparison ever.
---
Whoever ends up taking over Test space when this is all over, just blue Brave and let us stay in the SOTA factory. We'll keep providing content for rando fleets flying through.
---
You selfish ass, theres only enough for 1 person! What a damn space jerk.
---
I always gate back rolelrs that get trapped, it is a proper adventure to take a &gt;9000 s align time, 0 m/s Megathron for a spin.
---
Maybe things are different in other regions but in catch ratting close enough to GE-8 for standing fleet to be able to respond to you in 30 seconds is a bad idea unless you want to get jumped every 15 minutes. That aside that's assuming the hunter is by himself, in my experience that is overwhelmingly not the case. The initial guy is just the tackle and 3-4 more guys are about to follow up if you can't break tackle.
---
Pretty sure he was mostly useful just so CCP could say they had an economist.

On one hand, definitely yes: they love their dreads. On the other hand, this post becomes so much funnier if you are not flair baiting.

With atleast 400m pi per farm, how is it a net negative?

---
They are already here why do you think the prices have gone up, they have secretly been building and infiltrating alliances to do that. The alliance is already hit 500+ members
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHbNuyubhz0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHbNuyubhz0)
---
Because 2b is too much for anyone. I mean, as a PLEX seller it's all good for me, but I don't  need 2B every month so I'm definitely not going to purchase any more than I need. The higher it gets, the less often I need to sell some. I the meanwhile, the argument of "you can buy subscription with IG farming" goes away at that price. 1.5b is already a pain.
---
there are many things to criticize in test, expecting the absolute bare minimum of pressing one button correctly isn't one of those things, much to the contrary.
---
Would you want to play a game that had the entirety of it's friendly public community go balls out, hate boner on you after you spent a year trying to do beneficial things and genuinely trying to be a good CSM while the devs and designers all assigned guilt where there was none? I personally wouldn't want to remain a part of that community.
---
I am assuming that you just found reddit today?
---
The leather club is two blocks down

Very GOOD!
---
white dicord user is the real story here...
---
Well, they can't make the core design changes they'd *need* to make in order to retain those 10k players (such as reducing skill training times and purging extraneous filler skills) without alienating their existing player base. So they're effectively fucked and everybody here is at fault.
---
Uh yesterday? And you're on the offensive so it really is just your side that's capable.
---
It's so much more ... vehement!
---
Make it only have one hull timer, max of 24 hours to reinforce.
---
Different caliber of ships do different amount of damage on different size of citadel,  dread fleet will do much better damage on Keepstars. Destroyer fleets for astrahus, battleships for fortizars. You get the point. Then remove damage cap, except on hull timer.
---
You really have to be a clown to buy from weird sites, given that there's a perfectly legit way to do it. Sorry not sorry.
---
There's no way you're doing PI on 600 characters though
---
&gt;Because 2b is too much for anyone.
---
If it were it wouldn't be 2b, 
---
&gt;the argument of "you can buy subscription with IG farming" goes away at that price. 1.5b is already a pain.
---
lol. 
---
2b is 20 hours of incursions in a t1 battleship (thats 40 minutes of incursion every day)
---
2b is 15 hours of carrier ratting 
---
2b is 10 hours of supercarrier ratting 
---
You can skill extract you toon each month (3 on one account) and only need like 200m left to plex, thats two hours of incursions
---
You can do PI for 10 mins each week, on all three chars (one full account) that would be around 1b, half a month in plex. 
---
Making isk today is literally super easy, thats why the prices go up. When it gets to a point were people are not willing to pay more they will stop rising. 
---
You shouldn't be able to grind in game for less than 20 hours and be able to plex. We seriously need to nerf isk generation. Plexing have always been something the rich do because they have throwaway isk. If "poor" people want to do it they need to grind, 40 minutes per day is not hardcore grinding and you can literally do it as a few week old alpha.
---
Want lower prices? Blops more krabs.
---
That would be horrible for the game, but it is the chinese way.
---
Take another sip.
---
not using dark mode DansGame
---
Yeah well step of your high horse and get on the level where you're a new players and you probably barely have enough skills to VNi ratting, need to train 50 other things and pay for others too.
---
What I actually mean is my alts now cost 50 mil a month to run instead of 2.1b a month, but yes it turned into a roundabout investment in plex prices too.
---
I got some audible feedback from the room. I clearly was not the only one with that question.
---
&gt;If it were it wouldn't be 2b,
---
They are forced to buy, so that doesnt apply.
---
plexing have never been for new players. 
---
No one should start playing eve because "hey i can grind in game for a sub". It will burn you out. 
---
This is how markets work, older players will always have the tools to make more isk than newer players. Therefore plex will always be "high" for them. 
---
A t1 battleship for incursions takes around a month to get into. thats not a lot
---
and even for us vets that plex, 2 bill is getting a little much.
---
im not sure why we're caring about newbros plexing when the lifetime advice has been "dont try to play 'for free' at first it turns the game into a really shitty paying job" but ok
---
Hey CCP
---
Some players are somehow logged in 23/7 and active at all times. Are they account sharing, botting, or both?
---
incursions as isk making for players basically means staying in HS.
---
yesterdays fleet wasn't even prepinged, there was very little hype for it was frt hyped the shit out of it so it was likely to be blueballs. i'm sure the northern bloc have never blueballed a fight ... *cough*  UALX after downtime *cough*
---
No one is forced to buy.
---
If your the time you need to make enough to sub for cash is more than what you need to sub with isk, you sub with isk.
---
For fitting, the key is to know what you want the ship to do before you fit it. If you don't have a clear idea of what you will do with it, it's hard to decide what to do.
---
If I have a clear picture, the rest tends to flow pretty straightforward.
---
Like if I want a kiting tristan for FW, then I know I want a warp disruptor and an mwd. And then some buffer so a medium shield extender. That leaves a little fitting room so some drone damage augmentors in the lows and maybe a nano to be faster and more agile when managing range. That leaves high slots (nothing, no fitting left) and rigs (tank and/or agility).
---
Maybe they shouldn't have relied on Python as heavily as they have. Time for a rewrite in Rust.
---
iBuyPower are the same people as CyberPowerPC I think...I got a PC from them (custom built) about 3 years ago, it was a really great experience.
---
People say "just build your own machine!"  Shit I'm 42 years old and been building machines since I was a teenager, it's nice to have someone else build it for you. :-)
---
Did you Have it totally custom built or just buy one of their pre-mades?
---
idk, i never had problems when buying stuff on MMOGA, might be because i only use it as game retailer and not for ingame currencies tho ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
No it doesn't.
---
My first years in EVE i spent cloning between my null staging and the incursiongroup i were with.
---
Good on him. RIP burnout though. He’s pushing super hard. Let’s see if he can keep it up over the next months.
---
If it's anything like CyberPowerPC you can choose every single component, down to the case and fans.  He may not have physically built it himself, but he probably chose what went into it...
---
And you're NS alliance basically never used JC I assumed ?
---
Yeah, I don't think I would ever be able to not do that. When an opportunity comes around, seeing another easy target during the travels is just too tempting to let go.
---
Yes

I always balls the upvote space in someone's

iBuyPower lets you custom build one, he may not have bought a prebuilt.

&gt;"Contrary to what some people think, a lot of new people join EVE Online every week," he said. "Every week we have about 10,000 people that log into EVE Online for the first time. 
---
But the number of concurrent players is going down or flatlining.
---
I have some I'd like to upload
---
And just as with other games that have currency selling sites it's most likely Chinese run website.
---
WoW is plagued with them. KalOnline and FlyFF are just completely overrun with them. I had come across quite a few in Rift too.
---
I smiled and laughed so hard that people asked about it in the elevator... well played good sir! Well played! :-)
---
Not really relevant.
---
You have lots of tools to make enough isk to plex. You need to decide if thats worth your time over subbing with cash.
---
There will wlays be someone making more isk than you, therefore plex prices will always go up. There is nothing ccp can do to stop this
---
*laughs in autism*
---
As someone with a small farm, that's fine.
---
I think it's a good balance if injectors help subsidize my alt accounts but don't generate a profit.
---
Nice projection. Fight provi yourself.
---
They are just very dedicated players, they love their Vexor Navy Issues so they spend 23 hours a day watching their screens!
---
I get it but this is just the wrong direction to tryhard in. Manipulate PI prices and make 600 chars worth of profits per month for 1% as much effort or something.
---
&gt;High prices on their own are good for CCP, they encourage more people to buy plex with RL$, which nets CCP more profit than subscriptions. 
---
No. A high price means they dont need to buy as much.
---
&gt;High prices also crowd out multiboxers,
---
Probably not as they and bots are the ones driving up the price.
---
&gt;but single-account players aren't as heavily affected by plex prices.
---
If they are plexing, they are. They cant really scale their income and are therefore the most likely victims.
---
Where can I get a hat like that?

I proceeded to kill him when he undocked. 
---
I gave him 35 mill for the ship cause generosity is not lost on me, I just like killmails. I hope he is doing well in Initiative.

More than likely both account sharing and botting.
---
There’s nary an animal alive that can outrun a greased Scotsman.

---
There is a benefit in that most other isk making acitivites become less obsolete if the intention is to plex. This means more non-alt farms can also plex. These players create content.
---
Once we were out in muninns and PGL warped us to a ping and told us not to move when we landed out of warp. We sat there at the ping for like five minutes not moving, then we got bombed and ate shit (the muninns survived but the expensive logi frigs and other support all died) because he wasn't paying any attention to the fleet. He then proceeded to yell at us about how shit we were.
---
I don't think I've been on a pgl fleet since.
---
Why pay him thousands of dollars for him to say "Sorry, we fucked up."
---
This was a great read
---
If they dont buy they lose omega status. This is not the same as picking a cheaper ship to fly.
---
Mostly Reddit

all gank, no tank for Blitzing. Only accept missions that allow fast blitzing.
---
You could do ghost or sleeper caches, they have three levels for each, and can all be run in a t1 frigate to some degree. Ghost sites are my favorite, because they are simple and offer really good loot, the trick to those is that the explosion when you fail the hack deals about 10-15k explosive damage, and a couple heated explosive hardeners is enough to survive those. You might also look at combat sites, which you can run in a gila, Stratios or t3c, and can also be really profitable.
---
If your interaction with PvE is limited to run havens/forsaken hubs or incursions only, it's your fault. You could do your billions in highsec if you knew how.

I mean hunters are not alone but you just have to hold out until your friends land, it's you home so you like have escalation advantage.
---
all you really have to do is land scram dual web and cyno on a armor tanked VNI then jump in a fax and the hunter is completely fucked.
---
Blops hunter the once that are mostly cloaking 2 billion or so is gonna be down the drain, that's you virtue set + the hull + sp. 
---
If it's a interceptor for a roaming gang, sure you likely only kill the gang but still your fax and VNI combo are likely to win against most small gangs, given you have escalation advantage.
---
&gt;Tomorrow (well, today in EU, Monday I mean) is some big time fighting.  We have a major Strat op at 1845 eve time that is likely to draw a fight, and then we're going to have some late US TZ action as well.  See yall there.
---
&gt;major strat op
---
You are forced to be omega if you need to use certain skills/ships.
---
Multiboxers are what turned me off. Made me feel like I wasn't playing properly unless I had a fleet of myselves with me. I never had the desire to make another character because that made me feel less immersed in my main one.
---
Yeah trading and moving shit 24/7 instead of playing the game is much more fun, you are so fucking enlightened.
---
But you're nlt forced to need certain skills, you play the game however you want.
---
Nothing stops you from spending all your time grinding for isk, nothing stops you from paying with rl cash
---
Fake news. CCP solved the botting problem by teleporting 10 dudes into Highsec. #WITCHHUNT!
---
Lol omg this is great, ty
---
&gt; then jump in a fax and the hunter is completely fucked.
---
And i instantly understand why your perspective is so fucked up. No one i know would risk their fax to save a vni.

I'm pretty sure that's not what they're referring to. ;-) I have fun while doing PVE. For my part, I find the key is variety.

No, people are smugposting because he stole it off one of the nicest groups of AT pilots in the game,
---
They're fine.
---
Never had a prostitute before :(
---
&gt;i mean there are a lot more groups in highsec than in nullsec, so that's just wrong
---
Still  only five corporations are responsible for 50 percent of the wardecs. Totally different thing outside of highsec. There are a lot more groups killing and losing stuff. And the 4% stat is also highsec wide. Something is wrong. It is too easy currently to avoid losing ships as an aggressor.
---
&gt;it looks like their only sin is that they're too good at the game.
---
Or the mechanics are too easy to abuse.
---
&gt;Anchoring a structure and getting fucked when you're unable to defend yourself isn't supposed to be 'fun'.

Then if you want to attack them you should have to anchor a structure also. That way it's balanced. Or I would be ok if highsec is deleted and turned into npc nullsec. But wardec noobs want to abuse the highsec mechanics to avoid losses.
---
&gt;this assertion has yet to be proven
---
Bit like all your assertions?
---
&gt;you're fucking braindead if you think it would. a 600m raitaru can be anchored and lasts over a week.
---
If they are killed more they will make that 4% stat higher. More defenders are able to get at least a single kill. And they will also end the war if they manage to do that so there are more reason to fight back.
---
Fancy gear!
---
That was fun though. They should do that again.
---
you can only make billions in highsec by either giving a ccp employee a fun one under the table for god RNG or by running 20 accounts like gaara's sniper
---
Just make this game REALLY Free to play, remove skill injector buyable with ISK &gt; buyable with RL money (15-20€ the 1month SP?) make old / new skin buyable with RL money aswell, make EvE great again   
---
change entirely the PvE making afk farm impossible (no more bot) maybe just like incursion / sotiyo spawn &gt; the npc can form "roaming group" and attack player with a drifter - incursion AI (or just rework the PvE entirely = remove combat anom, isk come from NPC invader)  
---
make invasion NPC a thing, they can invade system, conquer system and if they conquer a system make them build structure (without a damage cap) and build fleet not just some random NPC spawn if you destroy them they need to rebuild them  
---
but that's only for Null sec for factionnal just make a "battlefield zone" you can attack/defend a system(=farm LP) only if adjacent to a ennemy system so bot can't farm there, bot probably gonna mine or farm in hi-sec i don't have any idea for this :/
---
The only things that CCP can do are to remove Injectors (not gonna happen) or reduce the £$E price of plex.
---
Good for you, doesn't address the bots and injectors fucking up the economy.
---
I’d still use it to scrub my cast iron.
---
Ah, ok.
---
Wasn't sure the current anchoring graphic was always there.
---
Fear and Loathing in LSC4-P
---
The point is, with most groups the issues are small enough that they don’t have to have leadership make an entire post basically calling line members bad at pretty much everything
---
pirates are still affected by jams, they'll target the jamming ship only
---
neuts/nos do nothing, don't bother
---
pirates are affected by tracking disruptors, they'll miss more often
---
they can always rep, but there's a bug that can stop capitals from repping
---
MMOGA is a legitimate UK game code retailer. It's no more shady than G2A. I've used them for Steam game codes numerous times without issue.
---
I have seen faxes dropped for less tbh. 
---
Now it's funny how we go from there completely safe to yeah i don't want to risk my shiny toys ( that are cheaper then a blops hunter ).
---
Last I heard (which was a while ago) things like Ewar and neuts didn't affect NPCs.
---
Good fitting, good slot layout, actually very pvp capable (frigate pvp). Price isn't that much more.
---
Covert Ops 4 is the point where the covert ops scanning gets better, they are equal for relic analyzer.
---
ccp screwed up.  Brisc has the resources to fight them.  They do not want discovery to happen they will clear Brisc of all wrong doing.  He will quietly not run for CSM again.
---
Just to add, much like G2A, they are an intermediary allowing others to advertise codes they've sourced so I suspect in this instance the fraudsters are not MMOGA, rather the source of the Plex codes they advertise here: https://www.mmoga.co.uk/advanced_search.php?keywords=eve+online
---
You are forced to have omega if you need certain ships/skills. No way around that. This is why it is not a choice.
---
How will this work?  How are the Chinese going to purchase time and/or PLEX?  I thought it was illegal for CCP to charge somebody in China for either game time or PLEX, hence the entire reason for Serenity.
---
Thanks, i'm guessing the capitals you are talking about are the ones that spawn in null-sec astroid belts sometimes? What is the bug btw that keeps them from reping? Is it caused by player action, or is the AI broken?
---
or maybe market pvp
---
One single prostitute?   
---
LIGHTWEIGH BABY!
---
You owe me a keyboard. Spurt coke all over it from that comment!
---
plz no.  Innia was cancer.
---
Rixx
---
Equilibrium at work.
---
Honestly though they could have just taken the PLEX from the accounts and left it at that
---
Engageability matters. Often times you find these types of pirates when you let them come to you. If you go hunting, they tend to scurry away.
---
It's part of their RMT policy in the eula, at least their justification.
---
Pearl Abyss when they run a plex sale, more like.
---
This is next level market manipulating. In reality you have no interest in crystalline isogen. Mad ting
---
&gt; A : remove skill extractors from the game
---
I can get behind this
---
I mean, they didn't used to have faction destroyers or battle cruisers. It was just one skill that was later broken out into each faction to match the other ship classes. Seems like they actually wanted a larger skill tree rather than condensing it.
---
It's the people who keep buying that keep businesses like that running. Choices have consequences.
---
I’m a novice pirate for sure
---
I counteract that by getting together with a buddy and hanging up on solo ships(and occasionally fighting a 2v2)
---
Nobody is forced to buy anything. It used to be the choice was plexing, paying with real life currency, or not subscribing. Since the dawn of plex newbies were constantly told NOT to make plexing early on their goal. Nothing has changed about that. Making the game into a job just to keep playing is stupid. Go work 2 hours at Mcdonalds to afford your sub.
---
Skill injectors are terrible for the game and shouldn't be ~~so easily avalable~~ in the game at all
---
He should honestly be kicked for shooting blues tbh, what kind of dick does it take to have to join a alliance thats blue with people to kill them smh
---
We're only losing 10 cents per item but it'll work if we do it in _volume_ !
---
EVE 2 would only make sense if technology has changed so much that a fresh start would allow significant performance boosts and new features because of it.
---
To my knowledge, there has never been an actual sequel to a mainstream MMO. GW2 really doesnt count as its an entirely different game than GW1, and GW1 was barely an MMO to begin with.
---
I'm currently going through career agents of races other than my own - getting a better understanding of basics and some money in relative safety. When these initial things are done I'd like to try some casual PvP in small ships.
---
What kinds of setups are available to new, alpha, players? What kinds of fittings could I buy a few of, and how should I be flying them, targeting what kinds of prey?
---
You’re safe,
---
Your wallet isn’t.
---
Well, the trick is to avoid having to by the crack candy in the first place.
---
Does he have eyes?
---
I mean, fair I guess... but people are stupid, and you have to account for that. I am positive a sizable minority of the people who purchased plex this way thought, "oh, I cannot buy isk, but isn't plex the totally legitimate thing you can buy and sell for isk? And this website offers such a huge discount over the eve store. Must be a legit re-seller having a sale."
---
&gt;Dock up your faction titans
---
Why do you yell at every comment!!!
---
Thanks for sharing your adventure!
---
You can leech cap off NPCs with a nosferatu.
---
[This is a 23/7 vni pilot](https://imgur.com/gallery/mdCnQ2F)
---
tried it, constantly either got 0.01 isked by bots or made like 5mil a day in a backwater market with less bots
---
So much spilled salt. I hope you tossed a bit over your shoulder.
---
In all seriousness, though, thanks for these. They will come in handy. :)
---
The fact that CCP needed an economist to prevent them from putting things like RORQs into the game is the biggest condemnation of them I can imagine.
---
Is that still a thing? I thought they changed it years back or something so you can't "abuse" that anymore.
---
Same reason people sell plex. They have more money than free time
---
That's true, but if you're ratting you should be capstable
---
Apart from the obvious burnout it looks quite good. GF's!
---
a little behind the scenes, I was gonna write "we might ad well disband the alliance and I'll FC for Horde" but the i remember the perimeter keepstar and the wardec changes. Which is why i wrote it as it is.
---
See. This. This right here. Line member blaming. lol It's usually not hitting F1 that kills a fleet, it's the hundred other things. You could be the best F1 pusher in the game but still die to a bad warp-in, bad intel, wrong alignment, anchor flying too close/far, etc. etc.
---
With Frat's super fleet growing incredibly quickly it's important we do the same.
---
The proliferation of rorqual krabbers has grown our super deterrent massively since we left Vale. PL used to be regularly play with us and evicted us from Vale more or less on a whim for the funs. They can't do that now thanks to our intense krabbing. We have plenty to be thankful to krabs for, that shouldn't be overlooked imo.
---
None of the "really strong ship choices" are alpha compatible.
---
Try Kestrel or Tristan for starters.
---
They're usually your first steps into FW PvP, as for your engagement profile you're rockbottom in the food chain tbh.
---
Pretty much everything thats going to jump you will usually kill your sorry ass.
---
If you see any ship with Faction, T2 or ^(for fucks sake) T3 markers *(especially if you see a Hecate)* you better flap your wings and run. You should look for fights against other T1 Frigates and maybe Destroyer. But there are several Videos out there on Frigate PvP - feel free to watch them and get guided!
---
They’re shit for the game but as pong as they are in it I want to be able to afford them 🤷‍♂️
---
Used to be?????
---
They brake the rule get banned. If they just take the Plex then they would have to take the Plex Everytime.
---
Yeah but where's the evidence?
---
Yes agreed
---
so you are saying it's your responsibility to know which partner is or is not certified, right?
---
well thinking, suits ccp best
---
Whatever the price is, my point is the prices of supers have been driven lower by the proliferation of rorqual krabbers. We wouldn't have grown our super fleet to the point where we could repel PL without our krabbers. They deserve a bit of respect for that (as do krabbers in any alliance).
---
Fedo?
---
either way, all you need is some application modules, maybe a rig and 2 warp rigs to go with it, up to you and your comfort zone.
---
You can't dock, jump or warp.
---
*How do I know...* yeah, was a painful experience.
---
#MEGA
---
is markeedragon legit or is he also considered a fraudster? he's selling all kinds of stuff too on his site
---
The thing I'm confused by is that looking on their website they sell codes that are then redeemed by the eve website... so how is that not legit??? How would an a player know that the code they are getting is fraudulent?
---
Over the last couple weeks I've been doing my hardest to support the Drake econonomy and this is the result. Enjoy. :)
---
Wtf is aurum for people who aren't dinosaur eve players?
---
&gt;It will burn you out.
---
This kind of went out the window when F2P came in. F2P took this from burn out to systemically designed to not be possible. The whole F2P model is to drive up concurrent player count to create content for paying members. Whales feed off the small fish and all that. To be in the same venue for any length of time as most paying members you need omega. Yes you can use an alpha for some alliance level fights, but you are always compromising your alliance by having omega level skills or you are put into roles that label you an alpha. The way around this is to have multiple alpha accounts with different skill sets. All of this is deliberate from CCP. The social pressure from eve makes you want to upgrade. Having a limited skill set makes you want to make new characters and drive the new player number up. Both are good fro CCP. For the player though it is horrible.
---
If plex is so far out of reach for an alpha they either quit, or become a paying member. CCP has data that once a person pays just once they are hundreds of times more likely to continue playing. Either way there is resentment from the transaction and it is reinforced by the social pressure from being in an alliance/corp. That resentment is then transferred in a small way towards the community that a new player just joined and an experience is soured.
---
PLEXing an account does not fit into the F2P model, so it is in CCP's interest to extract as much money from a player before they are able to get to a level where they can plex.
---
_excitment intensivies_
---
&gt;That would be horrible for the game, but it is the chinese way.
---
I'd say it is the multiboxer / AFKer / botter way. Though the Chinese did take it to extreme once already and what am seeing from FRT they're doing it again and now TAMA will take it up another step.
---
I remember when krabbing wasn't a word. That'd be roughly around the same time frame.
---
PLEX prices soared specifically because so many options for low-buy-in methods of making ISK became normalized and accessible. Being one of the few things actually tied to IRL value specifically, it's no surprise prices soared only for PLEX -- all the manufacturing has been multiplied by 20-boxing Rorq farms. The only thing that supply has not been able to increase in response to demand is PLEX, as only so many people are willing to spend money to add it to the economy.
---
Complete side note, but I find it hilarious that a lot of eve players I’ve met (might be a completely non representative sample) are a bit right of centre IRL and all “free market blah blah”, but the same people are crying for CCP to intervene to manage the market.
---
Probably not. Confessor has better range and will generally outdps the kiki untill the kiki gets to spool up which won't happen on small rats.
---
awesome video.
---
btw, why btr0n hate China \~\~
---
ikr. theyre providing alot of content in fw space. actual pvp content, not just plex farming.
---
This, so much of this is needed! Nice story man. Glad you started playing again.
---
So alphas are limited to up to battleships and t1 battleship guns. Alphas can t2 all frigate and cruiser weapons and fly all the faction frigates and cruisers except the triglavian ones. The t1 frigate lineup is pretty good, and there’s a lot of choice in destroyers and cruisers as well. [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SV_sWWIinoheBaGZgL2nUVJGYwnsNJqJ) is a real good write up on the frigates, May be a little outdated, as the griffin navy received a nerf recently. Best chance for 1v1 fights will be faction warfare lowsec, usually black rise is a good bet.
---
Well, obviously it is your job to figure out if whatever you buy is legit. Both in real life and on the internet. If you buy stolen goods, that's not gonna help you when you're arrested with a bunch of stolen goods in your possession.
---
0.01 isking is entirely irrelevant, seriously.
---
Just ignore it.
---
&gt;As someone with a small farm, that's fine.  
---
&gt;I think it's a good balance if injectors help subsidize my alt accounts but don't generate a profit.
---
If you're not making profit, or the profit is low, why not just stop and focus on something better and actually engaging in the game instead ?
---
Yes, most certainly lol. I mean, we were calling them bad from the start.
---
Wait, that sucks, I want in on the PLEX sale lol
---
Vexor Navy is tho...
---
To a degree, yes, yes it is.
---
For one, you agreed to the eula and the terms. Which are pretty clear on RMT.
---
A lot of the economic problems are Goons' fault, or at least Goons are the ones taking the most advantage of CCP's broken game design. Injecting people into multiboxing rorquals and multiboxing near-AFK nullsec ratters is responsible for a lot of the injector and PLEX demand spikes. I bet Goons have an organised skill farm programme as well which would also be having an effect on that.
---
It's not only them of course but they always take broken game mechanics up to 11.
---
Wait, what happened?
---
ArSCHtUalLy that's basically the same as in space then. We're immortals capsuleers.
---
&gt;Now it's funny how we go from there completely safe to yeah i don't want to risk my shiny toys
---
This complaint is hilariously hypocritical in the context of wanting to be able to evade response as hunters. 
---
&gt; I have seen your corp drop titans to save a freaking proc,
---
In catch? I don't believe that. In impass? They might as well be in a different corp entirely.
---
stop day trading plex
---
What I've heard from people who get neg-walleted and stuff is that, on a first offense, they're *usually* pretty lenient and the people who get banned are repeat offenders. At least when it comes to ISK. Their stance on PLEX might be very different.
---
Now this, is a good post.
---
We have two bags of grass..
---
He's mentioned on https://secure.eveonline.com/etc.aspx at least.
---
its funny how everyone's goal is to play a game for free and then they wonder why the devs don't care that its hard to play for free. they have bills too!
---
What’s legacy space?
---
Of course it doesn't. You made two quite strong claims. I can't help you with one of them, but your second claim is a result of you overly narrowing your definition of "PVE". I'm a little tired of people complaining that all PVE is inherently x (broken, boring, etc) when they could avoid that experience with a minor change to their playstyle.
---
I know variety is good for *me*. I am suggesting that it also might be good for *you*.
---
sure, shady wardec tactics says otherwise
---
you also forgot to mention the rest of that ping, which is mostly about timers that were wrong and a tacked on reminder about the op.
---
I'm assuming the codes were initially purchased with stolen credit cards. And the charges were reversed, leaving people out of pocket.
---
I know you're trying to tie this to victim blaming so you can autowin the argument but line members in null blocs are incredibly fucking dumb
---
Plex was 4b on the chinese server years ago.
---
[CCP lists him as an approved reseller with links to his store (and others).](https://secure.eveonline.com/etc.aspx)
---
yet they ll go out sperging each time he mentions it
---
This is my main question now... who is not legit??? I want to support EVE workbench but not at the price of me getting banned.
---
Just make them pay a lot of isk for siege timers... if you dodnt pay while damagecap is reached gg it going to die.
---
And make it expesive so not anyone can have a personal astra online to krab in peacr and safty.
---
&gt;China and Korea are different countries brohan
---
True, but due to natural proximity they do a lot more business with each other then China and Iceland. Also businesses and their employees in Korea are a lot more familiar with Chinese laws, business practices etc., then a country in EU or the US. So yes, they are different, but they are still much better positioned to deal with Netease then CCP is, although CCP holds the ultimate trump card in that they can yank the license or simply not renew it if things go wrong.
---
Aurum was a new form of currency CCP introduced, around 2011, such that you could purchase items in the online store.
---
You would buy PLEX, PLEX would be converted to Aurum, then you would buy things with it in the store.
---
Needless to say: it never got anywhere.
---
CCP has actually removed references to it from their website [sneaky bastes].
---
Somebody [did write about it](https://tagn.wordpress.com/2011/05/27/eve-introduces-a-new-currency-aurum/) of course.
---
Yeah I also panicedand instead of ungrouping them I unloaded them rip
---
A while ago, on this sub, I found a gif called "infinite salt box." it was some old timey movie clip, with subtitles which read "enough salt for our village. enough salt for the country. enough salt for the whole galaxy." or something along those lines.
---
I've asked around a LOT and done some digging and haven't been able to find it. Anyone here know of its existence?
---
I love Eve and have about 2k hours from a few years ago. That being said I just can't get into it anymore. If Eve 2 was released you bet your ass I would be all over dumping a shit ton of time back into the game. That being said I have no idea if that's a popular opinion.
---
[*cries in alt*](https://evewho.com/corp/Qwo)
---
No TEST bong?
---
Players only have two choices if they need omega: sub or plex.
---
This is not the same as choosing to fly a cheaper ship. So plex is going up because there is no real choice.
---
GMs teleported bots into high-sec, flagged them as suspect (allowing anybody to kill them). They did this a few times during the last gm week.
---
[https://www.eveonline.com/article/pdt5f6/gm-week-day-one-review](https://www.eveonline.com/article/pdt5f6/gm-week-day-one-review)
---
They use stolen cards to buy legit codes, then you buy it from them (this is where they get their money). The owners of the cards notice and dispute the charges. They get their money back, the code tied to that purchase is invalidated, and you get punished since your game account was the one that redeemed that code.
---
All this effort to ban a small number of people who deprive CCP of revenue, but absolutely nothing done about thousands of bots who bot isk to buy plex, increasing in-game plex prices, and therefore out-of-game plex purchases. #CCP_TOO_CLUELESS_TO_REALIZE_SHORT_TERM_REVENUE_WILL_COST_THEM_THEIR_JOBS #sad
---
&gt;Plex was 4b on the chinese server years ago.
---
Yes, and I can't wait for it to be 4B here. With TAMA coming over, FRT ramping things up, hell even the upcoming Trig stuff where a lot of people will be activating their PvE toons, things are looking good for it to go up. Though unfortunately it will most likely hit like 2.5 or 3B it will take quite a few of the big jumps for it to increase significantly.
---
We're immortal, our hulls aren't. Unless they're docked. Then they can apparently survive anything, including the citadel it's in going up in a nuclear fireball.
---
These scams usually offer the in game item at a drastically reduced price, because it is all profit for them as it is bought with stolen credit card info. so yeah they should have known simply by the "too good to be true" standard.
---
why would you just sit there while being bombed in a frig?
---
&gt;Want lower prices? Blops more krabs.
---
Why would we want lower prices ? Game has too much multiboxing, botting omegas (yes i know alpha bots blah blah blah), skillfarms and other types of cheese shit in it. Plex needs to go up, not down.
---
I never changed my portrait when all that came out. Been happy with mine.
---
Would your average player buying Plex off of the perimeter Market either by contract or sell order be at risk here?
---
GFs
---
Can you share your fit?
---
I hope so or I have a problem
---
What is the rough payout for L5 missions right now?
---
&gt;and PVE was fun and engaging
---
I recall CCP Sreegs dismissing this as a way to reduce the incentive to bot back in the day.
---
Of course he could have been referring to CCP's lack of ability to produce such PvP.
---
Stupidity is not an excuse.
---
It never was, and never should be.
---
Or he decided to sue them for slander and they got cold feet... I'm not a lawyer is that possible? If it is oh god.
---
no corpses shit party
---
&gt; They can't do that now thanks to our intense krabbing.
---
they can´t do that now because most of them were clever enough to stop playing this shitty game.
---
I don't remember if there was an automatic conversion to the new portraits, I think you had to create a new one when the system was first launched if I recall correctly. The old portraits were a completely different art style.
---
Also, while trying to find an answer to this, turns out theres a few websites online that have the whole database saved and you can search for your character there without having to download the 14.3 gig archive yourself.
---
[I found mine.](http://eve.evildayz.com/evetars/1593242064)
---
Seems like it's a case of severe spodbrain among the linemembers. I mean, rorqs getting dunked left right and centre under the supercap umbrella, severe damage splitting, not aligning, not anchoring properly, and more...
---
Also looks like it's strat FCs making too many timers and max CTA pinging every time, burning out FCs and linemembers.
---
I feel bad for Sapporo, looks like the guy really tries his best but the spod is out of control at this point

Literally, serenity right now.
---
Just borrow him a hand, then lend him the AT ship.
---
Mostly TEST talks the talk but doesn't walk the walk. Remember their "invasion" of geminate? Because I do lmao
---
It's easy as fuck and makes it less of a hassle to afford multiple specialized accounts to utilize for different parts of the game. If you haven't adapted to this already then don't, the price is fine😎
---
Any suggestions?
---
Basically, you know all the stuff like skins in the New Eden Store?
---
Back in the day, you didn't buy that stuff with PLEX, you bought it with Aurum, 1 PLEX = 3500 AUR (also worth noting that 1 PLEX in that equation would equate to 500 PLEX in current terms, as it used to be that PLEX only had 3 functions - selling on the market for ISK, trading for a month's playtime, and buying stuff like multiple training (well, people with more money than sense could probably have used it to bait a trap or something I suppose). Which is why it's called PLEX - Pilot's Licence EXtension. 
---
I remember coming back after 4-5 years away getting a thing on Steam for a discount on 500 PLEX. I nearly had a heart attack until I saw how PLEX spending had changed.
---
Aurum wasn't liked and is rarely spoken of (think of it this way - Aurum is to Eve as almost every video game movie is to the original game series - horrible and unnecessary).
---
You can't just activate Tesselation in a game that doesn't use that feature - the same with a lot of other things.  
---
Usually the only thing you can force a client to do outside of it's normal parameters is resolution based. Resolution itself, Anti-Aliasing and stuff like that.
---
&gt;Honestly though they could have just taken the PLEX from the accounts and left it at that
---
I wonder if quantity or size of purchase plays into it too. Its one thing if some unaware dumbass makes a single time purchase of 500 to plex his single account for a month actually thinking hes buying from a legit site, and another thing where an alliance leader(s) purchase 10s or maybe even 100k $$$ worth of plex to fund their alliance.
---
Its too bad he didn't post a bit more details on it, but he might not be able to as credit card fraud is involved and the whole thing might be under law enforcement investigation or at minimum is being investigated by the CC companies.
---
I've historically been a big fan of this fit for literally any kind of fun in eve, as literally all of any ally of panfam, facwar, or legacy coalition probably knows. Great job, and +1 for the sabaton.
---
First of all you have no fucking clue what i do for my money, so maybe cut back your fucking strawmaning, second of all variety helps with burnout and would work if you at least had a little bit of fun doing what you do but get burned out after a while, it doesn't help when you enjoy none of the activities.  
---
Doing 10 boring activities instead of 2 ain't changing shit.
---
Remove damage cap, allow cits to be repped instead? 
---
This would basically nullify boosh raven fleets, too.
---
You want a dead game? A high plex price is very bad in that will cause a lot of players to quit and encourage multiboxing, command broadcasting, and botting even more so than now.
---
I wasn't being serious, I know damb well MkD is legit. Although tbf the best bargains I ever got were through Amazon.
---
Oh okay
---
Aurum isn't even that old. Does 6 years make me a dino? damn.
---
We've switched our armor doctrine to leshaks/dreks from legion/Loki.   Theyre cheaper, just as, if not more effective, and you get MJDs.   It's great for small gangs hunting caps in null.  Wormholer btw.
---
&gt; yes an atron, because an Atron shoved up a pirate's arse actually hurts
---
You launched my sides into orbit with that line.
---
Yeah... I'm by no means a TEST defender but at no point in the five years I've been around and in TEST have I heard an utterance of us considering ourselves "elite PvPers". Not even a little bit. We strive for competent, sometimes hit mediocre, but you're talking out your ass about elite PvP.
---
He is legit, he just appears sleazy as hell and has since his ulima days of selling in game stuff.
---
Err ... yeah you did.  When Incursion came out, the old portrait system was retired and replaced with a new one, in preparation for the WiS release in Incarna.  On your first login following Incursion's release, you **HAD** to update your character portrait.
---
&gt;so you are saying it's your responsibility to know which partner is or is not certified, right?  
---
&gt;well thinking, suits ccp best
---
It is consumers responsibility. A lot of countries have laws against buying stolen goods and will either smack you with a big ass fine or even throw your ass in jail if you do even if you are just the end buyer.
---
In this case you can play dumb and claim victim and most likely can at least get your money back from the CC company that you used on the site if its a single time occurrence or a small enough purchase, but if it gets investigated and a history is uncovered, your claims may be debunked and you will face the consequences from the CC company or law enforcement as well.
---
So were you always using the same script for the command burst? That being the tackle range increaser, or did you swap it around?
---
Yes.
---
Are they players from eve or from dust? You can't kick the players from dust.
---
&gt; everyone's goal is to play a game for free
---
Yeah, it's a *major* attraction for newbros that they hear "you can play for free and pay for membership with isk!" 
---
It's no wonder they get 10k new players a day and they all drop out when they find out you're not really going to be able to plex without 6+ months of training, if not much more if you're not laser-focused on the plex grind and instead just enjoying the game.
---
Ok I got it working.  I have AMD and I had to change the settings from Global Settings.  Won't work from individual profile settings.  
---
Other than Supersampling AA, I don't see much/any difference.  Except SSAA just makes things blurry and reduces FPS alot.   [https://imgur.com/a/deliZDY](https://imgur.com/a/deliZDY)

I don't even play (usually). I just stay subbed for posts like this.

but officer i was too fking stupid to know better

I found my original two :)

Triglavian doctrines are pretty nasty tbh... Whenever a gang of Triglavian is passing by I’m just like ohhhh boy, get to safe guys 😂😂
---
This is about buying from unauthorized online vendors (RMT).
---
And? That doesn't change anything.
---
It will help you if you can lead the police to the source.
---
No wonder I didn't know about it, that was a few months before I came back. 
---
Sounds fun though, should definitely be done more.
---
unless the rule breaking helps CCP's bottom line\*
---
Why would you not want it jumped though? 
---
There's no need to label anything "dangerous unknown" though ever, because it's super easy to identify wormhole classes visually without jumping through.

He's listed as an authorized 3rd party retailer on secure.eveonline.com, so I presume he's legit.
---
&gt;GMs teleported bots into high-sec, flagged them as suspect (allowing anybody to kill them). They did this a few times during the last gm week.
---
We know. Thing is, we need this ***every single*** week for a relatively long time for it to start making any difference. And not jsut with supers either, they should jsut teleport all banned VNIs, Gilas etc too and not just to Yulai but to Jita or Dodixie or Hek at least near. Dodixie Hek and Rens could actually use the uptick from it too.
---
&gt; How would an a player know that the code they are getting is fraudulent?
---
Buy from CCP, or an authorized source?
---
They pay a sub, so CCP doesn't care.  This one takes money from CCP, so it is TAIW...er, PRIORITY #1
---
hey it works for trump and co.
---
I've played EVE on and off for years, and every time I pick it back up I start a new account because I"ve forgotten everything I was doing as well as everything down to the borderline basics pretty much. It's not terrible, I do love the game...but holy jesus I haven't logged in in over a month because I"m just training. I'm at this impass where I can't advance into any new activities right now. L4s are relying on the ships I"m training and their support skills. I don't want to join a null corp because I don't want to get locked out there since I do have ONE friend who plays and he stays in higher security space since his corp is an RP corp...
---
The training system is a really interesting system but holy christ some of the time you have to spend just waiting  to start earning NOT minimal income without jumping into Null is ridiculous. 
---
Also, before anyone says to dip my toes into Lowsec...yeah, tried that. Get blown the fuck up every time.
---
I think it's gay as hell that bubble and point doesn't stop taking the gate lmbo. Hic pointed caps can still take it too
---
Skill injectors?... Maybe that's abit insensitive skill injector addiction is a serious illness.
---
You never had to re-create the portrait. I never did. You can go in there and take a new pic but I never saved it and set a new one.
---
&gt;We have a team of stratop commanders that are excellent, quite possibly the best in the game.
---
Nah this is exclusively a linemember issue, all the FCs (especially mastermind PGL) are flawless ^^/s
---
I want to start doing L1 missions in Hi-Sec so I can eventually start doing L3 and maybe L4 missions. My question is does it really matter where in the universe and for which faction I start doing these? Do I just pick an area in the map and do missions there? I know it's worth considering which enemy NPCs are in that area but is there more to it? Thanks!
---
dreadbomb both sides of the gate idiot
---
Yea tried ssaa and vsr.  Just makes everything blurry while sinking fps.  Fiddled around with other settings and there is no difference.
---
Once again, approved vendors  [https://secure.eveonline.com/etc.aspx](https://secure.eveonline.com/etc.aspx) 
---
If in doubt, ask directly in game via support ticket, or even on the official forums about a specific vendor.

---
People like to try new things, and a lot of people also like to be on equal footing as other players. 
---
That's why you see HUGE surges with Blizzlike private WoW servers when they first go up. Being part of that initial rush where everyone is first getting settled is by far the best part of any MMO's lifespan. A new EVE game would mean I don't feel like I'm 8 years behind with no way to catch up besides spending massive amounts of real life money to buy plex to buy skill injectors. It would mean I'd feel like I could start my own corp and actually get somewhere instead of just getting assimilated into an Alliance and eventually folded into another corp.
---
1 fedo = 10 prostitutes
---
I think I qualify as right of center and pretty libertarian. I've stated it is worth pointing out many players who otherwise would play will not as the isk price of a sub increases, myself one of them. Most of my accounts are unsubbed (and those that are not are waiting to expire while training some skills I wanted). 
---
There is a difference between arguing that something is in CCPs interests and mandating interference from CCP. It would probably be in CCPs near term and mid term interests to have a plex sale soonish. Arguing ccp should sell plex at a discount every once in a while to increase active players and encourage new subs to stick around isn't the same as "regulation" on the plex market. Its more akin to saying BMW should have the BMW 1 series because it allows a more affordable entrance point for people starting out in their careers and want to be able to partake in the brand. I can argue both plex and the 1 series without compromising an appreciation for the free market. 
---
On the other hand, I'm currently a uni student and not in charge of CCPs pricing decisions. If CCP decides no changes is in their best interests, and that results in me going un-subbed, then I break out the alpha caldari explorer no one knows about and putter around on that toon for a while. I think it would be in their interest. I don't think CCP is required to listen to me.
---
I'm not familiar with this eve corp.
---
Shut up and take my money!
---
How else will the little guy be able to defend all his sov without fatigue-less jump gates???
---
"The ~~minerals~~ skill points I mine are free."
---
We love fighting you guys btw.  Y'all always bring a good fight.   Brave space is best space.
---
Alliance ticker is DPSHT
---
I hate to be that guy but salt very much is a staple. If you did not have any salt in your diet you’d be running into serious problems real fast.
---
It has been proven that adding iodine to salt is an essential for infant brain development. If you don’t have that in your diet as a kid, you’re going to be actually more stupid than kids who did have it. It’s not a rumour, it’s not conjecture.
---
Salt is an essential. Too much salt, that’s the issue. Like sugar doesn’t have to be a problem, but too much sugar will definitely fuck you up, cue: obesity epidemic.
---
Don’t write off salt. Salt makes food taste fucking unbelievable.
---
Let's hope we get a great ~~feed~~ finale again!
---
Yep, forced you to.  Also teleported the ship you were in and docked it in your clone station, which made for quite a few supers in highsec.
---
I liked that in the latter parts you were toggling heat on your guns with binds too
---
clicking to toggle mods/toggle heat is inefficient as hell, the sooner you get rid of that habit the sooner you are less likely to have heat mishaps again
---
good video, make more!
---
&gt;If your interaction with PvE is limited to run havens/forsaken hubs or incursions only, it's your fault. You could do your billions in highsec if you knew how.
---
Please do tell. if you mean by marketing and trading then meh, pass on that autistic shit. the only things that are decent in HS are some of the L4 missions like the epic arcs when you first start them, burners when you first get into them and higher end Abyss when you first do it. First incursions can be OK too. 
---
But eventually only thing that is somewhat engaging longterm is Abyss, and the income for it isn't that great anymore. Sure its spiking up at the moment due to incoming Trig stuff, but that will level off and start going back down again.
---
A sad part of me wants to know if that ticker is taken
---
Nice fights! I love when folks take something deemed "shit" or hated on and turn it around to give it its own niche.
---
Also, love the end :)
---
It is for some crimes in America.
---
Great video, it hurt to see you die to the hel at the end
---
So? Just because the US does it, doesn't mean it's a good thing :P
---
it's shit and the CSM retards saying it's goof are dumb.
---
if you don't want to have to gate 4 regions for a fight, maybe don't blue up 4 regions. all they do is assist megablocks in control more space and blobbing more timers
---
CCP always serving #TheLittelGuy
---
&gt; Is anyone else getting mild "EVE Online 2" vibes from the sudden and directed PR campaign in the last quarter? There is a very shared narrative about EVE being a strong community with a lot of interest that is held back by its old tech.
---
I would come back for an "Eve 2" that was rewritten on a modern stack even if it had limited functionality at first.
---
They most certainly do not 'pay' for their sub. Its easily earned with their botted ISK multiple times over
---
Man, if only CCP could assemble a trusted circle of players for input on that region.
---
Yeah that's kinda gay and not the good kind.
---
We need better hisec security- build a wall! Make goons pay for it.
---
Still not popping up. Weird.
---
I'm probably too stupid to realize that people get off on cheesing for internet points by defending opinions given to them by a machine lovingly called a "boob-tube". If only I was smart as they were:thonking:
---
Clearly a sex store.
---
Wow potatoe mode will look sooo pretty
---
It was just the other init leadership with the problem huh
---
&gt;It's easy as fuck and makes it less of a hassle to afford multiple specialized accounts to utilize for different parts of the game. If you haven't adapted to this already then don't, the price is fine😎
---
I haven't had a need for so many accounts for a long time now, specifically ever since I left botsec and all its related cancer shit behind. The game has become much better for me and am already stocked with enough plex for years so completely a non issue. Most of the time I'm on 1 account, activate a second one maybe 1 out of 3 months or so and a 3rd maybe once every half a year. That's it. Just no need for more.
---
I new a man with a '!' in his name, for a click.
---
I also new a man with a lastname that was too long for a name-tag, so his just said 'Smith'.
---
Just remove bots! 4Head
---
I think im ok with an EVE 2 if they feel they need to rewrite the whole game again. 
---
As long as theres a lore reason and its set in a new galaxy. Have new Eden overrun by Triglaivans etc and the playerbase escapes through a new secret Sisters of Eve eden gate. 
---
The problem would be balance, 
---
Do we all start from scratch again? Would be kinda fun, if so how do you reward the players who have sunk 10+ years into the game already? 
---
How would SKill injectors affect that.
---
But inherently, hulls are, 99% of the time, money at one point or another.
---
Time to join TEST, I guess.
---
I heartily endorse this event or product.
---
good guy Peligro!
---
Will you have the guts to admit you were wrong when they're exonerated?
---
you can probably find it on https://zkillboard.com/character/96329553/
---
Thanks my man, we try to take any fight that we can and try to keep it fair and fun.. Unless it’s peak time , then there’s always one or two dicks once in a while that will drop a dread on a frig/cruiser fight and ruin the fun for everyone..
---
Also the best fight I’ve had in a while was few days back with some wormholers as well, I had set up a gate camp and we were mostly destroyers and frigs... Got scouted by some guy from wormhole society and then they brought frigs and destroyers as well, about the same amount of people... It was a fun little brawl, really intense one too haha
---
They gave the rats actual capacitor amounts with very slow recharge.
---
So that PLEX they redeem is free? Nope, CCP still gets paid.
---
The reason for the teleportation to Yulai is due to lore reasons, mainly it being the home of the CONCORD Assembly:
---
https://fiction.eveonline.com/new-eden/lore/yulai
---
Lore wise, the bots were sent to Yulai (more specifically right outside the Directive Enforcement Department) for abusing rogue AI technology and punished by the citizens of New Eden.
---
&gt;You want a dead game? A high plex price is very bad in that will cause a lot of players to quit and encourage multiboxing, command broadcasting, and botting even more so than now.
---
Sort term, perhaps. Long term, doubtful even CCP is that incredibly stupid to let their last and only cash cow die off. Instead it will finally force their hand to make some truly drastic changes that should have been in place already years ago, instead of stupid PR shit like we are getting.
---
The damage is already done...  Brisc would be an idiot to trust CCP or the CSM. 
---
If the theories are correct and several CSM members "snitched" him out would you trust your fellow CSM members?
---
The integrity of the CSM is ruined CCP took them at their word and it led to this.... CSM is now nothing but a dog and pony show.  Would/Should CCP trust anything from the CSM any more?
---
What happened to the CSM statement that several members were contemplating?  &lt;crickets....&gt;
---
The CSM members and the developer(s) who approved the original post should be publicly identified and removed from any "trustworthy" position.  
---
Of course with the Icelandic culture of apologizing is a sign of weakness nothing like this will happen.
---
I dont need to fight Provi. I am not the leader of Warped Intentions, as Minerva Arbosa would be the leader of Warped Intentions. We are about as krab as any other alliance in null sec. Nice flair bait though. 
---
Seems like you are mad about my statements. You need some help bro?
---
If I recall correctly he quit and went to work for the government of Greece after their bankruptcy.
---
Once you get to a certain size, I rather imagine it can be a pain. My former Alliance was usually really well-disciplined across the board, but fleets rarely topped 40. It has some top notch FCs too, some of the best I've ever gamed with - but once you hit that 200+ mark, I can see how it would be like herding cats.
---
I didn't say it was, you said it isn't and never was but it is.
---
Nobody or well nobody reasonable is advocating that hunters should be immune from getting baited, it's a natural part of the hunting in eve to learn to identify bait and you will be hilariously wrong plenty of times it's part of the game sometimes you just get out played.
---
The thing people are pointing out is that defenders advantage is insane right now, keep in mind a day of hunting for me means i won't play for like the next week because i'm gonna be so fucking sick of eve after it ( and likely walk away with nothing because the majority of the time as a hunter you catch next to nothing and no 3 vni's in 5 hours don't count ). 
---
Yes it was impass, i don't really think there all that different tbh because well they have exactly the same leadership.
---
So does that mean you can cap rats out now? Or is that just so you can nos them, are they immune to neuts?
---
thank you! I have those two on shift R and shift T and it's not very convenient to hit those combinations so I just click them. I should try using the keys more though.
---
yep I've been mostly using one fit
---
This has to be bait/intentional shitposting, right? There's no way somebody spends that much time in eve and still is that oblivious. Hell, a gang that small, he could've paid someone to defend his shit..
---
Nah this has to be bait. Or I'm losing faith in humanity
---
&gt; The reason for the teleportation to Yulai is due to lore reasons, mainly it being the home of the CONCORD Assembly:

&gt; https://fiction.eveonline.com/new-eden/lore/yulai

&gt; Lore wise, the bots were sent to Yulai (more specifically right outside the Directive Enforcement Department) for abusing rogue AI technology and punished by the citizens of New Eden.
---
O I know, I even parked an alt there to shoot them as I missed the 1st one. Am just saying that more and better exposure will get more players aware, especially newbs, and by default, like I said, Dodixie, Hek and Rens could really use some extra players at their locations. Jita and Amarr are ok.
---
Good news.
---
&gt; There was no pressure at all on these pilots they simply weren't paying attention to the fleet and they cost us time while we waited for them to catch up.
---
Whenever I had a mishap separating me from the fleet (missed an align broadcast, clicked on the wrong gate, emergency evacuation, etc.), I could end-up spending the rest of the fleet trying to find and catch-up with the fleet, travelling through hostile territory all by my lonesome.
---
TEST must have really patient FCs!
---
Pretty stupid mechanic imo. 
---
So here I sit, killing bloodraiders by the thousands. Some fool comes in to kill me flying a svipul, the second he points me the bloodraiders that I was just murdering switch to my aggressor and fuck his day up.... Ummmm ok....
---
or just change the binds! I mean, if they're awkward to hit then they gotta be changed or you'll never use them or fuck up using them
---
I should probably do that
---
will init start a black crusade against everyone who said fuck brisc in that thread?
---
that would be the greatest storyline in Eve history
---
Thank you! Was considering making all of the songs sabaton hehe
---
A place where I should file for sexual harassment. Like come up with a better come back than what script kiddies were using in the 90s.
---
But who will be on the CSM now?
---
&gt;So that PLEX they redeem is free? Nope, CCP still gets paid.
---
There is a caveat though. A lot of plex has been in game for many years, CCP got paid at the time it was purchased, and the thing is, they already spent a lot if not all the money that the plex was bought for. 
---
For CCP it doesn't make a difference how many players are plexing their accounts or when, but rather how much plex is purchased from their website or any of the approved vendors per month and continuously.
---
Looks hidden, therefore censoring.
---
High prices aren't good at either end of the scale.
---
The higher the in game price, the less PLEX whales need to buy to afford the in game item they're buying their way into (particularly if the price of other items is suppressed by mineral spam). At 1 bil per PLEX you need to give CCP £20-30 to buy a fitted capital; at 2 bil you only need to give them £10-15.
---
And rorq multiboxers can easily afford to PLEX their rorq accounts - if it wasn't profitable they wouldn't be doing it at all. It's exactly the single account players who are affected by high PLEX prices.
---
Because I have to spend 10 hours a day being at peak mental capacity. I go home from this thing called a job to turn off the brain, therefore, my IQ drops while I recover for the next day. Why are you a hater?

---
Well, they are probably just very dedicated players.
---
That’s a super awesome and detailed explanation and I found it extremely interesting. So how did you derive the EXACT value for those numbers? Is there a formula?
---
Also, “ They can only store a number exactly if it is an exact multiple of a power of 2.” 
---
Why is that?
---
Why would you buy from a site anyway when you could just buy from the source?
---
Interesting
---
Yeah I'm really not sure why the rats switched aggro. I guess because they activated tackle modules and they prioritize ewar, but the code never bothers to check "on who?"
---
Mind leaving your character name on reddit so people can see the boy behind the mask?
---
I have been known to be stubborn.
---
I just love tickling your fancy with grossly stupid comments. It hilarious to watch the salt flow religiously.
---
No everything you've said is correct
---
People were basically zoned out after sitting waiting for FC instructions for a long time, I think. I had actually docked up to go to bed a couple minutes before the bombing run but was still on comms.
---
*"We had two bags of exile, 75 pellets of blue pill, five sheets of high-powered mindflood, a salt shaker half full of crash, a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers. Also a quart of spirits, quart of spiced wine, case of tobacco, pint of raw Jump Fatigue, and two-dozen crystal eggs. Not that we needed all of that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can."*
---
Its really not, if you want to sell in any quantity it helps to 0.1 Isk. 
---
You dont have to, but its definitely not irrelevant.
---
Everquest 2 and Final Fantasy XIV come to mind.
---
Only cheese.
---
&gt; I'm not exactly what you'd call a deeply enfranchised player
---
So disenfranchised?
---
I wish we had a guy like Peligro for botters too.  
---
One thing that escapes me, though. Why should players unaware this was a fraudulent site be banned?
---
&gt; i think most wh have them blue
---
FYI, your WH bros must be shooting blues.
---
No, it means you can leech x amount of cap then you cannot leach anymore until the slow recharge recharges the rat. (ie you're done at that point)
---
Think of it like they have 2 cap sources. One you cannot hinder, the other will let you leech a small amount until gone.
---
&gt; I like shooting people too much as I explore
---
I never hesitate to lock my festival launchers on any target.
---
&gt; What is the bug btw that keeps them from reping? Is it caused by player action, or is the AI broken?
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/eve/wiki/rules
---
&gt; Posts cannot break the Eve Online EULA
---
&gt; Please do not post any howto guides on botting or how to exploit bugs. Please be responsible and report any bugs you find instead of making them public. Same goes for posting GM convos etc. We do not want you to get banned in eve because ccp managed to link your reddit account and eve account together.

tldr; make kills easier and without resistance.

So that's how my guys ended up in a station after being logged off in space for years. 
---
(Unless CCP auto moves accounts in space after X years?)
---
my opinions is directed by the so called *Fake News™*, tyvm
---
No it's just a token amount of capacitor so that the new nos mechanics wouldn't spaghetti code themselves all over the floor.
---
&gt; 2b is 20 hours of incursions in a t1 battleship (thats 40 minutes of incursion every day)
---
&gt; 2b is 15 hours of carrier ratting
---
&gt; 2b is 10 hours of supercarrier ratting
---
Or I could just work for an hour and pay for a sub that way. Everything you've said is a fucking awful way to spend your time, who the fuck wants to spend half a work week's worth of time just for one PLEX?
---
Do you have an imp? Asking for a friend
---
Ah ok, I figured it was not really for practical application by the player.
---
Being able to take the gate while scrammed is in my opinion ridiculous.  
---
I would understand if a single long point would allow you to jump though.
---
Most companies backfill when someone leaves/gets fired. Ccp is more of the “yeah,  it we used to have an economist” idea.
---
I'm not doing it for the farm. I mostly do covops/blops, which necessitates a bridger alt, a cyno/hunter alt or two, and often a fuel/bomb truck.
---
And I also use skill farms to supplement some VNI alts that I have spinning rock havens in the background. It's not much but at least it's not a fucking rorqual. I can't stand that CCP is methodically nerfing every other way to make money, I fucking hate mining.
---
If you go for a buffer kestrel, you **need** dual webs and either good skills or a range rig. Your engagement targets are at the edge of scram or flat out into web range. Personally I fly the dual web, shield buffer, AB, no point kestrel for sheer dps (2 BCS in the lows). It does around 200 dps heated with rage rockets and with dual webs actually applies.
---
You can do dual web, point, ab, dcu, ancil armor rep with a T2 damage rig as well (rest T1 bulkheads for extra buffer.)
---
Notice a theme?
---
Ah, that makes it a lot less interesting then. It would cool if they had rats that actually used cap boosters and could run out of cap, but I guess it would be too easy to just neut out most rats at that point.
---
This just in. People are idiots. 
---
You're blaming CCP for them being idiots. 
---
It's CCP's fault 50+ morons got scammed by buying plex. 
---
You're an idiot.
---
&gt; you keep all the bombers cloaked in system until the miners relax
---
Seriously?
---
There are miners that can relax with bombers in-system?
---
We are deep into the "long term" of the game, and its not going well.
---
&gt;The thing people are pointing out is that defenders advantage is insane right now, keep in mind a day of hunting for me means i won't play for like the next week because i'm gonna be so fucking sick of eve after it ( and likely walk away with nothing because the majority of the time as a hunter you catch next to nothing and no 3 vni's in 5 hours don't count ).
---
Sounds like you don't actually like hunting. And do it simply because you feel you need to.
---
&gt;Yes it was impass, i don't really think there all that different tbh because well they have exactly the same leadership.
---
You heard it here first folks, places like northern and southern united states the same places. The same exact places with the same behaviours mannerisms and values.
---
I dont like the guy but yeah, if hes cleared then its cool
---
Back when I played EVE, I had so many windows open that I couldn't see the ship or my surroundings. Those were the times, trying to be a space submarine.
---
Lol, it was honestly a lot more efficient than enjoying the scenery.
---
I agree, its retarded unless you have a stupid amount of isk
---
/u/ccp_peligro You banned me more than two months ago for supposed RMT activities despite not participating nor condoning such activities. When will you unban me?
---
I remember in UALX I eventually had to pull up dotlan because everyone kept asking if it was ok to shoot various tickers that I didn't recognize. I think goons, test, and brave all had negative standings, and iirc, only PL had blue standings for us. I had to remind people so many times that CURE are on our side
---
Yes!
---
If you're selling in significant quantities then .01 is actually more negligible...

Well done, you Woolworths Geniuses. Call your mothers and them them you made a contribution.

well, if you start folding, nothing can bail you out. they would help with big timers, but they cannot help with a general situation. unless they would annect the regions and let them sleep on their couch.
---
I never saw any alliance folding but then surviving not falling because of strong friends... Fcon died despite having powerful friends, DeadCo was basically done despite panfam (they bought themselfs out of misery though), Tri went under despite PH backing them etc. If you rott inside, the strongest wheelchair only delays the misery.

The fabric of New Eden is going to crack at the quantum field levels as reality breaks down as the foundation of the fictional universe begins fracturing.

&gt;Sounds like you don't actually like hunting. And do it simply because you feel you need to.
---
I like the fights, hunting is a means to a end sure like you have to get the locals to responded and sitting there going plz undock has never really gotten me results in k-space. 
---
&gt; You heard it here first folks, places like northern and southern united states the same places. The same exact places with the same behaviours mannerisms and values.
---
Nobody does that, me yes I have seen Americans do that, you they must be from the south, me Yes they where but that's the same country. 
---
You there must be no difference between the north and the south.

Keep in mind where talking about a group that has like 8000 people rather then a country here.
---
i'm saying fuck brisc in this thread
---
not because of whatever nda drama
---
because his posting is worse than mine and that's saying something
---
I love how you just melt T3 after T3
---
It actually probably has a lot more to do with the fact that Eve literally started out as a free-market/economy simulator (which was one of their biggest marketing points for a very long time) than whatever dumb bullshit you retards pull out of your ass, but who knows?
---
DeadCo lost because PANFAM+GOTG is still extremely outgunned against goons
---
FCON lost because they had 20 dudes in fleet for a max cta, TEST will never come to that point as long as goons are willing to for several sub cap fleets to come to their fights, which they do already today. 
---
Horde never fully deployed to help TRI 
---
If test truly folds of course they would die, but goons would never let it go that far

You can actually extract roughly 3.8 times per 30 day period at max SP/hr.  You should be able to break even or be slightly ahead selling SP for game time.

Can we at the same time add inability to jump a WH if you are pointed or scrammed.

it all depends when you buy extractors/sell injectors.

But this would also mean you have to stay in expensive clones all the time, so for actually using an account you would probably be around 3-400m short of plexing

---
cool bro, story
---
Aurum was its own special currency you could only spend in the New Eden Store.
---
The main issue with Aurum was the pricing structure. Aurumn could only be purchased with PLEX (back in the days when 500 PLEX was just one PLEX), and that Aurum couldn't be converted back into PLEX or ISK. IIRC the conversion rate was 1 PLEX for 3500 Aurum. 
---
The issue arose where, either stupidly on purpose, the amount of Aurum CCP charged for items such that if you bought a higher-end item in the store then you'd only be left with about ~500 Aurum, which wasn't enough to buy anything else. It basically functioned the same way XBL points on the Xbox 360 worked.
---
And of course the only way you could spend this extra Aurum was to buy another PLEX to buy more...
---
can i tripsit u?
---
I'm a *long* way off battleships and most of them don't quite interest me, either. In the interest of price and skills, I'll absolutely be sticking with small ships for a while. Thank you for the link, I'll give it a read! :D
---
And think of the planning required to figure out what the shortest distance between two points using 5 AU jumps is! it probably took at least 20 minutes per route!
---
^ this. I miss being victimised by PL on JBs with sabre bubbles, very sneaky and cool way to start fights. Now it's easy to re-approach and jump out even while pointed.
---
Revenge is sweet, even when not dealt by us. I approve and look forward to you dropping on me when I’m ratting.

It's impressive how long the mwd didn't burn out in the first fight.

You don't have a different opinion. You're just retarded.

Go to Jita 4-4, Caldari Navy Assembly Plant and set your home there.
---
Run Missions for Caldary Navy, since Jita is the main Trade Hub in EvE its smart to reduce your taxes there...
---
Caldari Space is usually crowded with Guristas amongst other hostile factions so you better go for high kinetic damage and resistances.
---
There are several [Guides](http://schildwall.phbv3.de/basics/npc_damage_en.html) out there and on [dotlan](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/region) you can look up wich enemys occupy a region of space. If you're running missions they will tell you in the log wich faction you're up against - you better decline missions against other Empires, if your standing towards them declines they shoot you if you happen to travel thru their space. For normal Security Missions you can go with specific resistances against enemys or just run Omni Resists, either Adaptive Plating or Adaptive Hardeners with resistances against every damage type.
---
I find Adaptive Resists the most carefree but if you struggle in higher missions you might switch for specific ones since specific resistances are way stronger.
---
you are completely wrong. In many countries, civilized ones, there is very solid consumer protection law and if one company is selling something exclusively, they have quite a lot of ways how to prevent other individuals or companies selling their stuff.
---
but hey, who cares, we can blame people being stupid ... ah wait how you can really say that plex pack was official or not... but seems to be a lot of very clever internet warriors around eve which can always see what's behind, lol
---
&gt; Cloaking is already a 100% safe mechanic to abuse as it 
---
It's cute when nullbears turn the risk/safety talk on their hunters. But let me break one thing to you. The way the risk/reward mechanic works in Eve is that the more risky space gets, the more reward you get from it. E.g. you can farm anoms in hisec and be safe. Concord will intervene. But you will get less money. Or you can farm in null, take some risk, and earn more money
---
So farmers are the ones that should be under risk. Cloaky people are THE risk. Ofc they need some level of safety in order to operate hostile null space.
---
&gt; Being immune to reprisal is a very lazy way of hunting
---
If you can make this comment you have no idea what it's like to hunt in hostile null space. I am coming to your sov null infrastructured space looking for fights. Only you enjoy having titans, fatigue-free jump bridges, citadels, intel network, and an entire coalition behind you in this area. You can boson hostiles at gates. You can bait them. You can freely use your supers and titans. You can gatecamp them. If all that's not taking a solid risk on the attacker's part, I don't know what you think risk is.
---
I bet if you bump this ship, it can bump a planet

---
&gt; I like the fights, hunting is a means to a end sure like you have to get the locals to responded and sitting there going plz undock has never really gotten me results in k-space.
---
Thats rich. Every time i've participated in a fleet to fight hunters they tuck tail and run as fast as their little legs will take them. They only thing they are interested in is frags on nice soft ratter targets.
---
&gt;Keep in mind where talking about a group that has like 8000 people rather then a country here.
---
Then all of eve is exactly the same. If not being in constant contact and living under different sets of rules won't generate slightly different cultures then all corps are essentially the same. from hisec to nullsec to wormhole space all exactly the same.
---
Why did you censor your ship name?
---
Its fine if you nos a ship of the same type as yours or larger you can get quite a lot of cap from it while ratting. It's just nosing smaller ships that won't work at all and if you neut them you can't nos them as much.
---
...well, of course it is? I mean with freedom comes the responsibility for your steps (and wellbeing).
---
so the people you are closest to in game is irrelevant? ok? Then you are just proving my point that you're just another linemember and not really a part of a community.   
---
I even know all the people in my spy alts corps better than you know your fellow dredditors
---
All hail the State. Jesuschrist.

Knowing CCP the changes will be implemented far too late. Lots of Chinese people left Serenity well before it was shut because the market was already hinged on bots (no botting means you couldn't buy anything. PLEX cost 4bil, and even basic T1 BS hulls cost hundreds of millions of ISK because bots were mining and running anomalies for ISK.
---
People still played it because Chinese gaming and botting is pretty synonymous anyway - leave the bot running for a day, play an hour, repeat. Westerners are not going to bother with such shenanigans and will move to other games instead. I'd rather not play anything at all than require botting or grinding for hours in eve.
---
CCP needs to hit null anomalies really hard to make people actually fight over space and make botting more difficult because of real people competition. The fact that a single smallish region can support the biggest group of players in the game with MASSIVE industry is simply ridiculous - a real world area like that would be a barren toxic wasteland by now.
---
I'm the nicest guy you've never met.

Your point was that you had low prices but k, change the goalpost. You don't deserve "respect" for krabbing, its not like its hard to do. No one is saying krabbing isn't needed, but don't act like full time krabs aren't 6th tier citizens

Markee dragon is legit and got his legs as he creates a marketplace where plex aka subscription could be purchased with many more currencies than CCP was accepting at the time, allowing players in more remote areas to play. Rather than do the work needed to impliment this increased collections, they just green lit him to continue to resell.

No matter what you choose you will face rats from different factions, so you will need refits of different shield hardeners/missile types/drones based on what youre doing. One thing to consider is that the lower the security status the better the rewards, so if youre committed to staying in hisec you will want to pick a corp that has lvl 4 agents in a 0.5 or 0.6 system. Next thing to consider is building standings by running storyline missions will lower your standings with other factions, so running gallente/minmatar will lower your standings with caldari/amarr and vice versa. This can be important because higher standings will decrease your taxes at trade hubs for the correct faction, but they wont go higher than the base if your standings go negative. This can also he circumvented by placing your buy orders in a player owned citadel and putting a range of 1 jump or however far so people can still sell to your buy orders in the citadel, but you will still receive your goods at the hub, or by simply placing a day 1 alpha character in the hub and never undocking it. Also you will lose standings against empire factions in the missions themselves as for instance if you pick a gallente corp some of the missions will have you shooting caldari ships. This can be minimized by "blitzing" missions and avoiding the rats with standings triggers, or eradicated by declining missions that target said faction, but you can only do that once every 4 hours per agent. Declining missions is not viable for that reason unless you can 1) find a system with 3 or 4 agents level 4 and rotating through them, or having multiple omega accounts and having all your character slots on your alt account filled with dedicated mission pullers, these guys can also have the added benefit of extra PI slots, flying cloaked interceptors if youre in low/null, mining barges that you cam afk except to pull and turn in missions, other stuff too.  Another thing to consider is how valuable a particular LP is, you can find that info on fuzzwork. You really want to make sure that good valuable LP is available for your chosen corp. A good rule of thump is 1500isk/LP selling to buy orders, or 2500isk/LP if you want to manage sell orders (doable on a day 1 trade alt). Lastly if youre set on highsex go for it, get a cheap hauler and grind standings fast doing distrobution missions, but if you decide you could give nullsex a try they have epic arcs available with only 1.0 standings, and with the event standings boosters (that expire in october btw) you can start pulling level 4 missions in a couple hours. I used a worm on a 4 day character and a booster to do the epic arc then started running level 4s in a gila after only a couple more days training, all as an alpha (didnt actually spend the days training though, just used a couple daily alpha injectors. That was on an alt tho so if there was activity in the null region i was running the missions in i would just log off and play on my main instead. I recommend Eve University as a corp to apply to if you want to run L4 missions day one. They have mission fleets at there hisec campus in amygnon, a 0.5 system, and they also run pirate missions for Intaki syndicate at there nullsec campus in PC9 which is more valuable LP but the fleets arent running 100% of the time like they are in hisec.

It’s insane that they don’t give fatigue. I didn’t even understand how cancer these things are until I put an alt into the imperium and used them.

I would suggest making an account from the EvE Online website, I did not like having to keep logging into steam to launch the game launcher, Steam also added almost nothing, besides the Steam login requirement.

I had a custom build. Was building up an old 2013 Dell Optiplex but that process proved to be beyond my capabilities at the moment, I can’t get the motherboard hooked up right on that machine so I decided to just get them to build me a good starting point and I’ll upgrade as I go from here.
---
Some of the most profitable ISK/h in the game is possible with null incursions. You can bring capitals and supers into incursions in null space. Most people kill the incursion as soon as possible because cyno jammers are a huge pain to deal with, but you can do HQ sites in 10 supers ridiculously fast (50M payouts every 3 min more or less). It's also pretty safe if you have a good intel network because of the constellation-wide cyno jammer.
---
I've even seen people bringing a titan to DD the Kundalini, which makes it the fastest 100M you could hope making in a standard incursion site.

&gt; nullbears
---
Credibility meet toilet.
---
&gt;So farmers are the ones that should be under risk. 
---
They are. All the time and the risk is exactly the same as it was 10 years ago. But today people band together to defend each other. You can piss and moan all you want about how "safe" this makes them but all it is is hot air. 
---
&gt;Ofc they need some level of safety in order to operate hostile null space.
---
I'm not saying cloaking should not offer some or even a lot of safety. I'm saying it shouldn't offer perfect safety especially from people actively hunting the cloakers for weeks.
---
&gt;If you can make this comment you have no idea what it's like to hunt in hostile null space
---
No i don't because getting those "dank frags" from soft ratters is not interesting to me in the slightest.
---
&gt;I am coming to your sov null infrastructured space looking for fights.
---
Wahhhhhhhhhh
---
&gt; Only you enjoy having titans, fatigue-free jump bridges, citadels, intel network, and an entire coalition behind you in this area.
---
One i don't have titans, i cannot even fly a carrier or dread. And the rest of this is for the most part people working together which no you can't take that away go fuck yourself for trying.
---
&gt;You can boson hostiles at gates. You can bait them. You can freely use your supers and titans. You can gatecamp them.
---
Again i cannot do any of these things. If i brought a super to ge-8 it would probably die to dreadbombs from stain. And then someone would be cross with me. 
---
&gt;If all that's not taking a solid risk on the attacker's part, I don't know what you think risk is.
---
Sitting cloaked up at a safe off a gate providing intel to the rest of your "elite gang" of ratter hunters who tuck tail and flee if any resistance undocks is absolutely risk free to you. You only incur any risk moving between systems or actually engaging a target. Until then you have all the time in the world to look for a target and wait for a good one to turn up. Not from moderate relative safety like the defenders have but actual invulnerability.
---
If you want a fight come down and fight, otherwise drop this bullshit pretext of hunting ratters to get fights.
---
I hope they actually answer these days.  I couldn't get a straight answer a few years ago about some of out contests when I was still doing my EvE Radio gig.  We had to shut down a lot of random DJ giveaways because we weren't certain if we counted as a "third party" even if everything was done in game.

you have access to the game without plex.

&gt; Or he decided to sue them for slander and they got cold feet... I'm not a lawyer is that possible? If it is oh god.
---
His statement lays out the rough outline of a legal case and ends with "I'm going to pursue every option." I'm sure that got CCP's lawyers into the loop and I'd bet the lawyers said "take down anything you published alleging wrongdoing by Brisc until we look into it". At this point they'll either publish a self-congratulatory final update "We were right all along but we're such good people we double checked just to make sure" OR, a retraction and abject apology (which presumably will manage to apologize without admitting to doing anything wrong they could get sued for)

Most use i've found is for brawling it out in missions that your ship is too small for. Can be a pretty fun challenge.
---
Well, yeah it matters if you want to go solo. Why can't a relatively unskilled newbie find a role to contribute to in a fleet, though?
---
Yeah, I have seen guys do "challenge" runs of level 4 missions with assault frigates, seems pretty fun, besides the lower DPS output.
---
While the concerns about botting and RMT are valid I think most people agree a big disruption to the TQ balance of power is a good thing
---
But Yossarian still didn’t understand how Milo could buy eggs in Malta for seven cents apiece and sell them at a profit in Pianosa for five cents.
---
8 mill + 60-90K LP per blitzable mission. LP can be easily converted for 700K isk per 1000 lp. The really good traders will find rates at 1 mill and above per 1000 lp . I don't think that is reasonable for most factions.

So just double checking...MMOGA is the scam site? Asking so my dumbass doesn't do anything too stupid

Hey, the new jump gates are the best thing ccp has added since citadels, they reduce the cancer of region design and facilitate fights. Now the fact that caps can take them is a little OP, but they are otherwise great.

Yes, you dumb motherfucker, yes
---
RvB, no spies? You can get a alt in there ridiculously easy
---
Yeah i wouldn't do lv4s like that, the challenge at that point is less staying alive and killing rats and more "will i die before this mission is over because of how many hours i've been sitting."

This sub in any amount
---
It's happened where our mains are dealing with one thing, dreads are on standby, someone says "hey, I found this gang, here's a cyno, people are gonna cram their dreads through to where on as much stuff as possible. It's like "hey, he's doing it, I want to do it, I want to do it better than this guy, and I wanna get the loot."
---
PLEX is also bad for the game. I realize that many players benefit from being able to pay for their subscription(s) with isk, so this isn't a popuplar opinion. 
---
I am convinced that the game would be a lot more fun in general if paying for your own subscription was the only way to play. Imagine everyone just playing to have fun, instead of trying to PLEX their accounts.
---
Need the smart bomb on auto repeat in the high slot so that you managed to whore on FCs shiny pod
---
It was definitely neat to have our little 20 man thrasher fleet get dropped on by a bunch of dreads. 
---
We noped out pretty quick. Got a myrmidon kill though.
---
What is this 2014, steam works great and some deals are steam-only.
---
you can jam the drifter. i know that for sure. and nos them.
---
Come back anytime. :) fuel is cheap.
---
In my experience the best “elite pvp’ers” were some of the most self (and outwardly) critical people I’ve ever spoken to. 
---
Every little thing was analyzed and talked about if we had any derps during a fight.
---
It’s mostly boiled down to being okay with being wrong. 
---
When it comes to anything I’ve noticed the people who suck the most are the ones who get insulted when they’re told they’re shit. The ones who don’t get bothered tend to improve out of their shitness pretty quickly.
---
Cause he's too scared to jump things into the hole to fight on equal terms without being able to cyno.
---
Thank you for the numbers. But aren’t all the L5 missions systems camped?
---
There is a list of approved vendors, they should not get a pass for not reading it.  They can google buy eve PLEX or w/e, so they are intelligent enough to browse the eve website
---
what the fuck are you on about? You don't "need anything".
---
If you want something, ok. go get it, if that means you have to be omega, ok, go get it. You don't "need" shit, you WANT.
---
There is no reason for it to be easy to plex just because people are not willing to play to get enough isk or fucking pay for the game they are playing
---
No idiot, my subscription cost has remained constant.
---
Are you specifically referring to the old models that CCP used to sell? They show up on [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Eve-Online-Faction-Tempest-Ship-Polystone-Statue-Model-Rare/123293765697?hash=item1cb4e19041:g:VsgAAOSwTMxbZ53p) ocassionally.
---
&gt; They are. All the time and the risk is exactly the same as it was 10 years ago.
---
Eve macroeconomics says you are wrong. If you were right, I wouldn't argue the things I argue. Most farmed spaces in Eve are incredibly risk-free and you have to be straight afk to die. In safest regions (umbrella regions or bot regions) people lose less than 3% of all their farm to hunters, which is immensely low. In a balanced Eve that ratio should have been 15% at a minimum.
---
&gt;  I'm saying it shouldn't offer perfect safety
---
I don't base my arguments on my intuitions on what I think game mechanics should be like, like you. I base them on Eve macroeconomics. Is Eve nullsec incredibly safe? Is it hurting the Eve economy and ecosystem, causing people to leave? Yes. Then cloakers (people who make nullsec less safe) way of life are fine, and should be buffed even.
---
&gt; One i don't have titans, i cannot even fly a carrier or dread. Again i cannot do any of these things.
---
"You" there referred to whatever coalition you are living with but sorry understanding that required a non-spodbrain. If you also had the slightest idea, you would get that a simple VNI ratter in most empire spaces enjoys the safety provided by other people gatecamping or bosoning for him, which is why these things are relevant. Besides, you were the one claiming hunters have it safe, and I just referred to mechanics which makes it unsafe for them.
---
&gt; the rest of your "elite gang"
---
It essentially boils down to this. You are part of the folk who plays Eve for asset acquisition, for a sense of belonging you derive from your alliance, for metagame. I play for killing stuff in a glorious way. You represent the culture who frowns upon my playstyle, calling it "elite pvp", thinking it's an insult. It's not. Doesn't offend me. 
---
Now all you have been doing is clashing your intuitions with me on what you think hunting/farming should look like. But you do it in a way that has 0 knowledge about the other side. And you do it ultra immersed in your own carebear way. Meanwhile, I don't base my arguments on my own intuitions but on how the game can actually be improved. Nullbear playstyle is what's fucking this game so hard. Inflating PLEX. Deflating minerals. Causing capital proliferation. Causing a stagnant meta with no wars. Ultimately causing many people to leave this game. As opposed to you, my hunting playstyle is harmless or even beneficial to the game. When I FC fleets each super/Rorqual I catch is content for 100 people for that night, a reason to keep playing. I keep your negative effects in check.
---
So you can fuck off with your carebear intuitions. Until you understand Eve macroeconomics you are not at my level to have an Eve balance discussion with me.
---
With the general hate for them it's honestly hard to tell...
---
He's legit now but back in the day he ran a forum for all kinds of RMT related stuff. 
---
Back when fresh max level WoW accounts and gold were still worth something. TBC era.
---
One of the ways he made money was through a service that did checks on sellers so customers could buy from a "trusted" source. 
---
Think he eventually gave up because everything was becoming a lot more professional and it was no longer viable for the smaller guys so income dried up. 
---
Plus WoW is now selling a lot of the services people used to pay botters for. Leveling / farming / gold / pvp ranks / professions.
---
You can buy level boosts and gold through Blizzard now and I think most games are following the PLEX route these days.
---
I had no idea there was a list of approved vendors and I've been playing for 10 years.
---
*yet*
---
Hehe. Back in my day it was 300 mil for 60 day game time card. Was also a lot more value back then.
---
My first hundreds of millions came from L4 missions and lowsex relic sites under 5mil SP flying raven (60mil) and helios(2mil). My first couple billion came from nullsec explo, and drone combat sites, 5-15mil SP flying gila (300mil) and astero (80mil). My consistent and dependable billions comes from smartbomb ratting and farming 6/10 and 10/10 Sansa DED sites, 20+mil SP in a machariel (2.2bil) and rattlesnake (1.5bil).  Next step for me is PI, moon mining, and industry, because im told that is the path to unlimited wealth in New Eden.
---
The game restricts certain skills/ships to omega. So if you dont have omega, you cant use them.
---
Why do you think having access to the game is the same as anything you do in game? Is one thing more important than the other?
---
&gt;There is no reason for it to be easy to plex just because people are not willing to play to get enough isk or fucking pay for the game they are playing
---
The only reason it is so expensive is because of multiboxers (caused by injectors) and bots.
---
Yeah supers running incursions sound like exactly the plan for new players.
---
Because there are a myriad of other options on the market that also let you play with a group, and don't mathematically hinder you. 
---
Not to be rude, but this is exactly what I'm talking about. People from the community come in and say "Oh well there's this or that way they can be useful in a fleet!"
---
They're being useful in spite of their enormous mathematical disadvantages, in a market which has by and large shunned or heavily blunted that sort of vertical progression. EVE has unique/clunky combat that's as far from intuitive as you can get, and you can't meaningfully engage in it against other players for weeks upon weeks (at least if you plan to be doing damage). That means you can't even get a handle on whether you enjoy it or not, so when most players look at that wait time they (quite rightly) decide that their time is better spent on a game that doesn't hobble them out of the gate. 
---
The learning cliff would be bad enough, but you're starting the race without legs too.
---
Isn't it time for Snuff to leave Low and move to Null Sec? You've already killed Black Rise and probably other areas of Low Sec. Time to move on and have some competition instead of the same old domination of corps and alliances that haven't a chance to stand up to you guys.
---
Is it really that fun? Sounds like insecurity and overcompensation to me.
---
Yeah. He was a gold farmer back in the early UO days, too. He didn't really start partnering with companies until he had to do it to keep his business running.
---
delet this
---
This. The game needs more fighting, not less.
---
They are basically driving the price of PLEX up naturally.
---
Funny they know about these sites  and yet tell no one and do nothing about it but wait until players buy it and ban them.
---
Amazing ccp amazing
---
Markee Dragon is "legit", however, he used to participate in the same practices.  He was a gold farmer for several games starting with Ultima Online.  I wouldn't trust him with my credit card info if he were the last online retailer on the planet.
---
It doesn't need to be managed. PLEX purchases and interactions due to botting accounts are a major part of the high cost I suspect.
---
I thought it was PSYGRB
---
Damn he sleeps few hours every 3 days ?  Eve addict?
---
lmao you're a fucking dumb person
---
Unfortunately CCP doesn't like money so there isn't any official ship models. Any other models, such as fanmade ones, is publicly not for sale due to the threat of copyright infringements.       
---
For example [Kisaki](http://kisaki.artp.cc/works_en) and [their amazing models](https://imgur.com/a/zj3i4) do not have [authorization and](https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/5hjnf7/eve_naga_modelcraft/db11cub/) cannot be [sold to you](https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/65bysz/the_stratios_ship_model/dg9442q/).
---
lolololololol
---
He was never partnered with UO selling gold.  Nor was he a partner with SWG selling Credits.  Get out of here with that shit.  The guy is a shyster.
---
Enter rampant and uncontrolled RMT.
---
It is what PLEX was designed to fix, and why games like WoW have adopted it.
---
Buy from the CCP Eve Online site. Done.
---
If only CCP had a marketing team that could monetize on this pretty evident and well known desire from the playerbase... but no, they are idiots.
---
Wouldn't you like a new skin? They sure have plenty of those.
---
You replied to the wrong comment didn't you?
---
Theres a reason people like to join snuff, they get all of the benefits of being in a dominant alliance, with non of the downsides of being in nullsec. Alot of us butch and moan about Sov grinding. We just wanna kill shit, we have fancy pods, and no bubbles.... fuck bubbles. The range of content is better in low sec.

Good for you?

How does having the game developer sanction and take a cut of RMT make it less rampant. It's far more out of control now than it would ever be if it wasn't sanctioned by CCP.
---
ok
---
only if you're rich or a politician, all the normal people get told ignorance of the law is not a valid reason to break it and go to jail anyway.
---
Fuck yeah, scorched planets all the way to Jove space
---
Not if you join the groups that camp them.
---
Not just them.  When they converted Aurum over to Plex and added pretty much anything to being purchased additionally with Plex instead of just having it be game time, they added pure value to having Plex and then expected the price to stay the same.  My reaction was "Duh?" The only way you're gonna get Plex price down in a short time frame is to do sales or permanently lower Plex price.  In fact upping subscription time is only going to increase in game Plex price as it just makes it more valuable.  The long term solutions to make each single isk more valuable but that's far more complex and involves reducing the amount of isk in game or reducing general items per player in the game which seems unlikely to happen and difficult.  Just because Skill injectors are part of that equation shouldn't mean they are the sole nexus of hatred.  I like getting the skills from them and find their value in game warranted.
---
You waste more of your own personal effort doing it, just adjust prices daily, and forget about it, it will eventually sell.
---
It boggles my mind whenever I think about it, but he said it was because he did a lot of drugs in his youth. I've lost touch with him a bit but he played EVE a lot and was an active leader.
---
holy fuck i'd be willing to spend a shitton of money for that machariel
---
why would plex a bot flying a ship you can fly as an alpha?
---
That or break into accounts and used saved credit card to buy plex.
---
This is difficult to find! CCP working hard!
---
it was a publicity stunt to make the public feel they care about botting, I wouldn't hold my breath on a repeat performance.
---
And not a care was given.
---
I believe they did move players in space to their clone station after a few years logged out, presumably just to maintain database space.
---
Of course, that was before Citadels. Not sure how that works now.
---
This must be one of those "you are not entitled"-posts. They are so useful!
---
I'm amazed at how pretty this game as and at how little it actually takes. I'm running a 1050ti in a SFF system with a 3rd gen i5, and I can crank everything up without any issues.
---
I'm assuming their one of the banned from seeing their name on a lot of comments against what ccp did.
---
"He has only sold stuff from games he is partnered with since the lat 90's or so. He kinda pioneered that as a business."
---
That is patently false.
---
Agreed.
---
Let's be honest, most people only think of fleet of said ships, when they consider how good that ship is
---
I'd honestly stop playing the game. If you're too much of a coward to go in after them, that's your thing. Wormholers have one fucking way to prevent supers from getting dropped on them to any effect, and it's fighting on a wormhole.
---
Yet they dont have alliance skins. Really makes you think
---
How many bots are you running in the background?
---
It wouldn't any money ccp qould get from said plex is refunded.
---
Good job taking the least important part of the entire post out of context.

&gt;Thanks

You're welcome.

Lol dude what happened to your Greek style of governing? Got ganked and locked out of structures gg dude.

---
Sweet a 2% return! Hit me up when you get into the 80s. Then we can chit chat in the big boy club.
---
Very cool!
---
mfw nazalghul is god tier shitposter
---
Confirming that it's you - you're an idiot. An idiot who keeps digging.
---
of course they removed the references, the release of Aurum and the in-game store will forever be tied to the Jita riots and while they are more than happy to talk about making gaming history by driving their fanbase to riot IF someone brings it up they would prefer to simply act like they never did anything that stupid.
---
Ba dum tst. Here take my upvote.
---
&gt; CCP only converted Aurum balances to PLEX for people who had over 1000 Aurum, so anyone with less wasn't compensated.
---
I always wondered if that was true because I put my characters to sleep for a few years before the conversion and all they ever had was the Aurum they gave away to encourage people to use it and when I came back to the game this past year each of my characters had a little over 100 PLEX each, so at some point they did convert the lesser amounts.
---
Dude, you’re breaking my heart here.
---
We’ve been asking for that for years. CCP simply cannot get a shop to sell their products.
---
However, the main reason I’ve heard, which does make sense, is that to build a great looking, not a good looking, a great looking, model, that mould costs stupid amounts of money. Money they will never be able to recover.
---
Having said that, I would LOVE to have an Orca and a Iteron Mark V [sentimental reasons], a Barghest and one of those new Triglavian ships.
---
And a Catalyst, of course :-).
---
And a Drake. I made my first billion in a Drake.
---
I know many pilots who are enamoured with their particular ship[s]. They would definitely buy one.
---
EVE has a whole zoo of ships, some of them iconic in design.
---
The Naglfar. The Naga. The old-style Hel [a ship that looked like the god of war had woken up cranky with a terrible hangover. Fuck, that thing was beautiful].
---
A Charon too.
---
If they had run that somewhat competently CCP could have made money hand over fist from selling pilot-centric in-game items.
---
Sometimes it feels like they’re doing it on purpose just to piss us off.
---
Never read the EULA?
---
&gt; you're a nobody

Wouldn't he talk about making more isk sinks like he said in a Dev blog? Or changing ratting isk faucets?
---
I’ve been out of Eve since 2014 but I stay here for the stories, memes, art, and drama.

Of that list I would, personally, only trust:
---
- Amazon
---
- Steam
---
- GMG
---
- Humble Bundle
---
We kicked him from Panic Attack. for being in fleet with Rogue Caldari Union, while in P.A. comms, muting and unmuting sound - I caught him jumping a few systems ahead of our fleet (Panic) scouting, which inevitably brought us around RCU's fleet and they picked off a few of our ships. 
---
Poor kid wants content and will fly with anyone, that's fair. No argument there. The issue is he will throw one group of 'friends' under the bus to another group of 'friends' just to be liked...which labels him a spy, or a douche, in the least.
---
Shade, you did it to yourself mate. All you had to do was leave amicably, not sell out your bros. 
---
We knew when he left our group that he was going to try getting into Snuffed Out after a while...I'm not surprised he had to try and fuck with that relationship. Outside Baltrom (No Handlebars RIP), Snuff bros are his idols, shame he didn't grow up a little after the falling out with us and HullPen.
---
Good luck in Spectre Fleet, Shade. I'm sure you'll change your ways *this* time.

The salt of poors is what keeps me coming back to this sub

The same way legalized weed makes the majority of weed buying people stop buying illegal weed.  
---
Your statement about the design of PLEX being to make game devs money, glosses over the fact that the action it facilitates would happen regardless of PLEX's existence.    
---
The general Customer/Player Base WANTS to trade in-game isk for money/time, if they didn't, there would not be a market for it and so PLEX would not be a profitable thing to create/design/release.
---
I didn’t even read my own fucking link, fml. You’re right the backtracked, edited the post.
---
&gt;The game restricts certain skills/ships to omega. So if you dont have omega, you cant use them.
---
Yes and as i've said multiple times, you don't need those skills, you want them. probably because you want to do stuff you need those skills to do. 
---
&gt;Why do you think having access to the game is the same as anything you do in game? Is one thing more important than the other?
---
This is insanely retarded and i don't even know what you got this from 
---
&gt;The only reason it is so expensive is because of multiboxers (caused by injectors) and bots.
---
Nope, plex prices have always gone up, because more and more players get better tools to make isk, the latest spike was because of a few people manipulating the market. 
---
There have always been multiboxers, this has nothing to do with injectors and bots.
---
There have been more ISK removed from the game from botters than ever, so if you were right prices would have gone down. 
---
Maybe look into how the market actually works. 
---
WTH is your point anyways? what change do you want? Prices will never be low enough for the little guy because there is always going to be someone bigger driving the prices up, this is how a market functions.
---
To be fair...the krabs are the same just a new leash.

It's almost like people keep flip flopping between "fatigue is bad CCPLS" and "We need fatigue because blobs"

Was informed as I rolled out of bed that Darkness were bashing a jump gate with about 100 men. Flashformed Muninn fleet, and bridged one system over. Jumped through and engaged them on the jump gate. Had some God-tier dictor pilots keeping them bubbled, and switched to EMP and just danced around their fleet as they tried to escape. Dropped caps as we began brawling. Brought in a Mino to assist with our logi dudes, who initially were feeling the brunt of the incoming damage, but stabilized quite nicely at the end, despite the fight going far out of the FAX rep ranges. 
---
After initially engaging, I found that they were holding, albeit barely, against our dps, so I fragged a couple of their logi, and then began deleting their fleet ship by ship. Kept us in EMP optimal almost the entire time, and it worked out very well. Beans had good fire control, and listened, and we fragged continuously until the last remains  of their fleet finally got out of bubbles and warped off.
---
Jump gate was saved at 3%.
---
Is Snuffed Out, snuffed out or do they snuff out others and if so who has been snuffed?
---
Black rise is literally one of the most active regions in all of lowsec. If it were dead, gangs would not roam there, and there would be sub 1k jumps/24 hrs in the pipes.
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Black_Rise#jumps24
---
As it is, there is roughly 3k jumps/24 hrs in the main pipes, and 3/5 of the most pvp-centric lowsec systems are in Black Rise. 
---
The mistake you are making is to assume that lowsec is the sole dominion of noobs and scrubs, like yourself: it is not. SNUFF are the original Kings of lowsec and this is our domain. Obligatory, git gud:

&gt;CCPLS 30% Jump Fatigue on Jump Gates?

&gt;I think sov warfare is stagnant enough
---
Tell how make war not easier will fix it ? You do realize jump gate help making fleet accross all eve because there is no stupid jump fatigue ? You do realize a fleet can travel the universe in no time thanks to no fatigue ? You do realize if you reduce travel from 1/2 hour to 10/30 min it make war easier ?
---
vOv
---
It's almost like not everyone always says the same thing. 
---
Tons of people immediately cried out about how asinine no-fatigue bridges would be. CCP is, of course, oblivious to this. Hell, they only realized caps using ansiblexes might not be a great idea after it was live and players pointed out how fantastically idiotic it was.
---
The entire portion is false. You stated he only sold items from games he was partnered with. That is false. You stared it has been this way since the 90s. Again, that is false.
---
@PronGodLegind, i am Gon but u are Deno. Still I Joy your bring much fun thanks

Cocaine's a helluva drug...
---
I thought he was just there studying stuff so he could write a paper on it or was in school for a second degree or some such. Not really sure he was there to manage the market.
---
My opinion is that RMT is bad for games, whether the game developer profits from it or not. Not having RMT sanctioned by the developer will not stop it from happening, that's true. It would happen on a much smaller scale if it wasn't sanctioned by CCP, that's for damn sure.
---
meh
---
What if they didn't know there wasan approved list? 
---
I only got aware of such a list a few months ago since I am don't even bother to go to Eve's official site for Plex, where discounts are almost never seen.
---
I usually buy plex for perks like skins when someone shares a promotion on this sub or check a price comparison sites. Shouldn't CCP check such sites wether they are illegal before going after the playerbase?
---
added dotlan + zkill links!
---
Trash cans of the galaxy and snooze dragon doing very well without NC/PL support
---
It actually has helped. The thing is that if you wanted ISK before PLEX were a thing, and didn't want to do any of the commensurate grind associated with it, you really only ever could buy it from shady websites. CCP would inevitably find out about the larger commercial RMT enterprises and subsequently nuke peoples wallets. Now you can still get isk from RMT websites and I suspect it's probably a tad cheaper, but you also don't have to risk ruining your account in the process, even if it is a few dollars more expensive.
---
&gt;points out a well known name 
---
Thanks for rubbing it in.
---
Same, but sometimes (rarely though) there are better offers than those  in legit shops I saw no complaints for other games.
---
Awww it’s adorable that you think that’s a relevant amount of isk.   It’s like when my 5 year old son proudly shows me his “big muscles”.  Very cute... keep at it champ!
---
"No. A high price means they dont need to buy as much."
---
But it will encourage more people to buy SOME.
---
" Probably not as they and bots are the ones driving up the price. "  
---
You're assuming all multiboxers are botters, they aren't
---
I know reading can be hard, nowhere does that say that he sold in-game currency while partnered with game publishers. It says that he has sold stuff from games he is partnered with **since the late `90's or so** — which I left intentionally vague because that shit was over twenty years ago and I can't be fucked to pull up exact dates. I made no mention of what he did before he started partnering with publishers.
---
Wow bro that's just phenomenal. What are your trade secrets? How can I be like you?

This is a great excerpt on why i refuse to come to any agreement with your side of the argument. You look down on my side, i don't look down on your side when you are being honest about what it is you do.
---
Just because i don't understand the whys of what you do what drives you to do it doesn't mean that i don't understand what it is you do. or the whys of the ways you go about doing it. The issue i take is not even with hunting ratters even if i think it's a bit of a dumb thing to bother with. You aren't some holy righteous defender of eve. You kicked over some kids sand castle and proclaimed that what you were doing is just because that kid was killing the game.
---
If you want to kick over kids sandcastles kick stand in their face and make fun of them go right ahead. There's room in eve for all kinds of weirdos. But stop with the delusion that you are some savour of the game for playing it the way you like while looking down your nose at the ones who don't play like you. 
---
Go out, hunt, run from the response for your aggression.

Stockpile, Stockpile, Stockpile

How about fatigue should be reasonable and balance between blobs and viavle content options?
---
Current fatigue in super blibs is almost perfect and I saw no complaints.
---
Still, a big entity can move their supers sledgehammer within 5-6 hours across the whole map (the summer wars in Immensea and X47 area), but at least it is not instant. Heard any complaints?
---
With current jump gates you have instant force application by the defenders wherever the blue donuts want.
---
You mean, you made 5% profit in 3 days? I think you should rethink your investments as I’ve made far bigger percentage profit in the last few days lol.
---
Way to be that guy, I can tell you really hated it
---
Nobody knows until they see the books at CCP if it's working out or not. That's not going to happen. So either take it or move on. That's your two choices.
---
&gt;But it will encourage more people to buy SOME.
---
On the individual level, maybe. Overall, the amount of plex is going to decrease.
---
&gt;You're assuming all multiboxers are botters, they aren't
---
There might be some other ways to get this amount of isk in a reliable way, but it seems as the price keeps going up, only multiboxers (caused by injectors) and bots willl be able to sustain it.
---
God damn that website looks like trash on a mobile phone...
---
&gt; and you have to account for that
---
umm, no ?
---
This thread fucking made my day.
---
It isn't much better on desktop either. I can't even find a dark mode setting.
---
Why is it that all these nice guys keep getting allegations laid against them. Man what a shame.
---
Sadly, all the other BR sites have been having issues lately. I miss br.inyourspace
---
This is a company who thought it was a good idea to try to sell a t-shirt for your toon at $60 when you could buy it for your IRL shell of a carcass for $20. They would much rather you buy in-game assets instead of IRL ones no matter how much money it could make them.
---
Hell, I would even take a model that I have to assemble and paint myself and, considering how many GW nerds we have here, I'm sure I'm not the only one.
---
TL;DR - x up if you're a GW nerd who'd pay crazy money for an EVE ship you have to assemble and ruin with paint yourself.

I lost like 20 of these before I could really run the t3 electricals without dying. I can do it every time now, but yeah, practice.
---
You were off by over a decade.  I mean, WoW didn't come out until the 2000's, and he was a HUGE gold seller and power leveling seller then.  He has only been legit for the past 10 years or so.
---
&gt;On the individual level, maybe. Overall, the amount of plex is going to decrease.
---
The amount of AVAILABLE plex maybe, but just because it isn't listed on the market doesn't mean its not still in the game. More than a few people over the past couple of months have admitted to investing in PLEX and stockpiling it as an investment with the intent to unload it at some point in the future when you have people doing that there is no way to tell for sure unless you are CCP just how much PLEX is in-game.
---
Let us know what the taxes and brokers fees were. Then we can see what your real % was

&lt;3 Sliv
---
My skills nosedive soon as I finish fit and hit undock.

Maybe they’ll have a chance if they bring 5 monitors next time

Gonna need it even more when that 10000 toon Chinese alliance moves over to TQ.
---
lmao your job is lobbying for ocean pollution
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ I guess you're the resident Markee Dragon expert. If that's what you want to quibble about now that you can't argue your straw man of shit nobody said… congratulations?
---
*We were somewhere around Sindicate on the edge of the Outer Ring, the tidi begin to take hold*
---
I got those values by writing a quick (like, 8 line) c++ program on http://cpp.sh where I declare a double with the corresponding value, then print it to 50 digits of precision. Doubles can't store 50 digits of precision, so I copied up to the last non-zero digit.  There is a formula, but I'm *much* to lazy to use it. 
---
Floats can only store multiples of powers of 2 because that's literally how the format stores numbers.  It's the same way that scientific notation can only represent perfect multiples of a power of 10.  We write numbers in scientific notation using a decimal number between 1 and 10, but we could just as easily move the decimal over and adjust the exponent to account for it.
---
For example, Avogadro's number is 6.02 × 10^23 but we could instead write it as 602 × 10^(21). Scientific notation chooses a power of ten, then gives a value to multiply by that power of 10. Numbers that aren't a perfect multiple of a power of 10 cannot be represented exactly in this format: 2/3 is not 6.666×10^-1 or 6.6666666 × 10^(-1). You need an infinite number of 6s, and if you only have a finite number of digits you'll end with a 7 if you want to be as close as possible. 
---
Floats do the same thing, but since they're for computers they use binary.  They would write 1/2 as being 1 × 2^(-1) and 3/8 as being 3 × 2^(-3).
---
&gt;Yes and as i've said multiple times, you don't need those skills
---
How do you fly a freighter without omega?
---
&gt;This is insanely retarded and i don't even know what you got this from 
---
Its not. It establishes an understanding of dependencies and priorities. You pretty much failed there.
---
&gt;Nope, plex prices have always gone up, because more and more players get better tools to make isk, the latest spike was because of a few people manipulating the market. 
---
Because CCP has had a bot detection rate worse than imaginable for years. Then there are injectors.
---
&gt;the latest spike was because of a few people manipulating the market. 
---
Very doubtful. We basically just ran out because the demand by cheaters became too great.
---
&gt;There have been more ISK removed from the game from botters than ever, so if you were right prices would have gone down. 
---
Because it used to be near fucking zero (relatively speaking)!
---
&gt;WTH is your point anyways? what change do you want? Prices will never be low enough for the little guy because there is always going to be someone bigger driving the prices up, this is how a market functions.
---
Injectors and bots need to go or the game dies.
---
Aurum had literally zero to do with Jita riots. They were years apart.
---
It wasn't just the part you were vague about that was wrong though, that is the thing.  And "vague"?  You were no where near the ballpark lololol.
---
Ok. you're too retarded to actually understand anything so I'm going to say it one more time. 
---
You don't need to fly a freighter, if you want to, cool, go do what you need to do to do it.
---
Your are completely wrong about CCP, bots, injectors, and the market as a whole.
---
I dont remember any major spikes in plex transactions when jita almost ran out and price reached botting levels.
---
I updated the site by adding an ‘all region’ to the market section, I also show the item displayed in /market/ (so if you come from an external link you know what item it is) and you can get some info about it.  
---
Also I load the render of data piece by piece in market/buy and market/sell so it display the data faster and load more data as you scroll them.
---
If you notice a bug or something please give me some feedback.
---
That’s a new one.
---
I made that much in about 3 minutes.  You should learn to play the market better lol.  Must suck to be that bad that you only have a 5% profit margin lol.
---
Im incredibly correct when it comes to plex, injectors, bots and a lot of other stuff.
---
The reality is that you cannot play the game in any "serious" capacity without Omega. When plex prices obsolete almost everything other than multiboxing and bots, the game slowly dies, which is obvious at this point.
---
This is strangely beautiful with the choice of music.
---
&gt;stop trying to logically explain something to a co2 supporter.    They will take you down to their level and beat you with experience.
---
You're a lot more emotionally invested in my comment than you really need to be and you should probably just go do something else for a while. Maybe go read some other comments, like the one I posted before you started spilling your shit all over the floor where I said he sold a shitload of UO gold before partnering with them.
---
&gt; no bubbles.... :monkaS: bubbles
---
All these people who didn't live through 2 (or maybe it was 3?) jump bridges PER SYSTEM pre-fatigue. Even after they reduced it to 1 it was still cancer for the longest time.
---
Yes, we will destroy you.  However we are lazy krabs, and taking us away from our preferred krab grounds would require significant motivation.
---
Good read, welcome back.
---
It works much better than the other sites, if you're on PC. Not responsive so pretty much useless when it comes to viewing these on a phone. With a few minor tweaks, mainly for mobiles, we're looking at a way better website to present brs in imo.
---
Advice? Keep in mind that the game doesn't really have stuff for you to do as such. You want stuff to do you need to go find it.
---
And as for referral codes you'll probably have to msg someone directly for one because they are banned from being posted here.
---
&gt;The reality is that you cannot play the game in any "serious" capacity without Omega. When plex prices obsolete almost everything other than multiboxing and bots
---
It doesn't 
---
I plex 6 accounts with only PI and extracting them.
---
The people plexing are not the little guy, its the rich people that can afford 2b,3b or even 4b for a month of plex. The little guy will always benefit from higher plex prices since those are the ones that buy them to sell.
---
And no you're not correct. Its some kind of twisted reality you have set yourself in, i guess you believe in chemtrails and flat earth too? 
---
&gt;the game slowly dies, which is obvious at this point.
---
Lol, you're a classic.
---
LUL wut? The Jita riots were directly preceded by the release of Incarna, which among other spectacular failures featured the introduction of the in-game store  called the Noble Exchange store or NeX, (which used Aurum...) The outrageous prices associated with the new store and CCP's complete and total disregard for player reaction surrounding the release of Incarna were the driving forces behind the riots. It also didn't help when some internal communication surrounding the player reaction was leaked to the player base and it amounted to "fuck the players we know what's best for eve".
---
It would probably be better overall if they straight up rebuilt the game on another engine and released it with an brand new slate.  Many people have previously stated that it is hard to get into EVE because they are not on the same level.
---
MMOGA is paypal partner, shouldnt they be legit?
---
Ask your kind an honorable friend if he would be interested in purchasing a ONE OF A KIND (not a single one on contracts in Jita !) t2 relic rig, which is guaranteed to be a GAME CHANGER for any serious explorers out there.
---
If he is, tell him to send me a DM on reddit and I GUARANTEE unbeatable prices.
---
Because they aren't unloading them yet, and why should they? The price is still climbing so the investment is still increasing in value.
---
&gt; a big entity can move their supers sledgehammer within 5-6 hours across the whole map
---
  Unless it's a massive TIDI fuck fest- the fight will be over in 5-6 hours depending on the distance. 
---
  No wonder why Goons only form up in Jackdaws- It's too far for them to travel across the map for a single fight.
---
Can the people using fleetcom pls just biomass Ingame?
---
But then they'd have to police it
---
:effort:
---
Thought you meant Great Wildlands nerd. I love Great Wildlands
---
Only gives you that 5% permanently if the price goes back down
---
^ This. I've not logged into my main character in forever since I created 11 others so far. I'm no longer emotionally tied to my characters as a result, and now I just view the game as a mutibox spreadsheet. The fact my dream of becoming a Jump Freighter pilot requires an entirely second account in order to cyno safely, has transitioned my win Eve scenario from attaining one and using it, to simply reaching the 20 bil ISK mark via station trading and calling it quits. I've been afk from EVE for a year now as a result. I see no reason to pay two subs just to fly a single ship.
---
Jump gates only make defending wars easier...
---
You do realize that the most active period in the game's history had no jump fatigue at all.  Fatigue inhibits fights.  Adding more won't improve the situation.
---
*The truth is out there*
---
They could make a ton of merch if they did it correctly why they don't do it is strange. In a sense it's a form of publicity as well as people seeing models might not play eve and become interested after buying a model
---
Why they do this instead of forming bombers or assault frigates  and running away when needed is beyond me, but can't complain.
---
Remember, follow the instructions ^or ^you'll ^be ^put ^to ^sleep
---
So we're both in agreement that the collective playerbase has no fucking clue what they want. And CCP has to juggle between every random idea and suggestion under the sun (including Twitter/Forums/Facebook) and somehow finetune every mechanic that makes everyone happy- Super pilots, and "the little guys".
---
You can't do shit *well*
---
Only once as far as I know and it was to force you to update your appearance.
---
But I'd have to log in.
---
If you are invading an enemy, apart form titan bridge you cannot cover a lot of territory fast. Do they not teach you that in the newbro corps? Big territory means something in some games. 
---
Viewing a war only form the perspective of the comfort of the defender is wrong and I must say retarded.
---
Interconnecting every system to the others makes a universe feel smaller. What is gudfites to you (being able to smash whoever appears on intel within 20 minutes) us fun for you, but you need to understand it is not fun for everyone and they will stop coming to you for fights eventually.
---
LOL this is a supershit post.
---
Don't use steam and your race has no effect on your character other than looks. You can still fly any ship and use any module after training for it. I still hear that one a lot.
---
My taranis!
---
I have a hovering Nyx model for sale
---
if by best you mean running around with high grade snakes then sure - anything other than that? well....
---
I got away with it 1 year ago 😬
---
this era work around super umbrella not subcap projection, having the ability the do 2 jump without fatigue to defend or 6+ jump without fatigue to attack someone, which one do you think is the most helpful ?
---
Imagine unironically flexing your in-game wealth.
---
Ok then? You literally brought more carriers than they did logi for a glorified turkey-shoot. I'm sure that must be a unique experience for a Horde FC to be on the other side of a turkey shoot, but colour me unimpressed.
---
&gt; they would prefer to simply act like they never did anything that stupid.
---
With this kind of fan base, the chances of that ever being forgotten is close to non-existent.
---
The statue looks broken. For a reason.
---
I did log in just for this. What is it supposed to do? Or what did it do in the past or is it new and just not working?
---
Yeah, huh ;-)
---
Shout out to the good folks of Rote Kapelle! o7
---
if flairs make you a someone then damn, that bugme guy must really be someone
---
sounds like you are pretty much describing daily alpha injectors which are  the pay to train from 5-20mil SP option.
---
better than a nobody in highsec lmao
---
I mean if you are ok with painting yourself surely it wouldnt be too hard to get someone with CAD skills to mock up a 3D print file for a ship.
---
You are wrong. I’ve been a customer since the 90s and he was “legit” as there were no rules against RMT in Ultima Online back then. MD is not a “shyster”
---
CODE...well known? lol
---
My corp never made so much corp roam since they added the jump gate, you know why ? Because you can get good fight within 30 min while before it was 1 hour to move from 1DQ1 to deklein, believe it or not, jump gate without help people to do pvp, but for that you need something at the beginning : The Whiling to do pvp and without taking my tinfoil hat, you must be part of the side who hide behind cyno jammer wall until big fight happen where you were kindly ask to deagress and hide away
---

Works fine for me v0v
---
Lol.  I have read all of the comments.  The one sitting there trying to claim he was "right", even though his falsehoods were pointed out is you.  Too funny.  You should get out more.
---
Probably yeah. 
---
Do stupid shit. Get fucked.
---
No rules against RMT in UO?  Wrong.  Oh so very wrong.
---
&gt;Unless it's a massive TIDI fuck fest- the fight will be over in 5-6 hours depending on the distance.
---
that's the point isn't it: that you can't get across the map in 15 mins but given a few hours you can. It strikes a decent balance between supercaps requiring marathon 12 hour move ops to get anywhere and going from tribute to Impass in 10 minutes.
---
CCP could team up with Airfix to bring us our models. would love to build and paint my ships. it's a win win for both companies just need someone to take notice Id deffo buy all the ship models and paints.
---
I'm going to test it to double check, but are you sure about the docking part on an NPC station?
---
Believe it or not there's more to wars than the 2 keepstar bashes.
---
I too can make a 5% margin on a lousy 30 million in about 3 minutes :)
---
While that keeps you busy i'll just keep reaping my profits
---
It is a button at the bottom of a solar system's Info window that says ``Show on Map`` that shows the location of that solar system on your map when you click it. Which is exactly what I expected it to do.
---
imagine being poor in-game and complaining about plex prices
---
taxes are what 1%? That's not terrible
---
Oh yeah, we also got a taranis :3
---
Cool you're in a krab corp that keeps their mains snuggly 40j deep into blue space. Maybe if you were wanting to roam you could move yourselves somewhere closer to enemy space?
---
Just timed my daily run, took 16 minutes 8 on each toon,
---
Wouldn't be half bad if the only null-sec entity in range wasn't blue to snuff (I'm looking at you INIT kids). Just no one to contest their titan drops atm and they aren't worth deploying for for most corps in null. And black rise might be kicking, but its no thx to them. They kill whatever fight they show up in.
---
Our kindest regards to you and yours o7
---
I looked at show info of the system I was in when I logged in. It has the show info button. Clicked it, nothing happens. Maybe that's the issue. Never noticed it or tried it.
---
Short answer to both questions is to join a newbro friendly Corp. I’d recommend eve uni if you’re interested in hisec/lowsec. Or brave or pandemic if you want into null.
---
What the f*ck is that webshite
---
The idea of "the collective player base" being a single unit is nonsense. Talking like it is and trying to get somewhere based on that is ridiculous.
---
Maybe you could explain what's going on?
---
No1
---
No, I made 3 Billion in 3 minutes. You need to get gud.
---
Man fuck what people say, amarr is the master race and I’d fly a space turd if it had that purity of the throne skin. #amarr4life
---
Your fit is fairly hilarious, but cool results?
---
I am in test, PvE staging is in D-P in Esoteria, PvP staging is in 08- in Immensea. Those two systems are 35 jumps apart yet I can burn a travel ceptor from keepstar tether to keepstar tether in under 5 minutes. And, good luck gating supers into a contested system under a cyno jammer. With fax as they are now that's how you kill your alliance. So far someone forming dreads makes supers dock up faster then CODE in the AT: if you commit them to an unstable grid you probably will win the timer but I don't think some random system in teniferis or detorid is worth 4-5 titans.
---
When you click on 'show on map' the map is supposed to be opened, showing you the system, duh.
---
They've sold all sorts of things over the years through different iterations of an official merch store but I'm not sure if they ever did well due to costs associated with all of the international shipping and what were probably very low order numbers. I have a zip-up hoodie that was relatively expensive and some faction emblem patches that might have been a bit more reasonable.
---
None. That's also not what's happening here.
---
I know it's darkness, but really? You need to brag about a fight that you blobbed with both triage and carriers to win? I mean go ahead and blob, everyone does but damn it's sad to come on here and brag about it after.
---
I’d also recommend eve uni as a really good newbro Corp.
---
RMTing doesn't work if you have no buyers.
---
Which is why they may be looking to expand the market.
---
Yeah, after some fiddling around it seems to be enabled for the new map only. Which makes sense. They haven't been adding new features to the old map for years and I'm surprised it's still an option.
---
Thanks, didn't know if the button was new or what? Did notice it didn't do anything. I never look there after 11 years in game lol.
---
This is faster, lol [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7dqadr/eve\_3d\_model\_repository/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7dqadr/eve_3d_model_repository/)
---
&gt; but you need to understand it is not fun for everyone and they will stop coming to you for fights eventually.
---
Congratulations, you've figured out the core concept here. We don't want you in our space. We want you out of our space. We don't want gudfites in our space, we want you gone.
---
Oh god this is maximum cringe
---
Dang it is spicy in here
---
Cancer
---
Short answer- yes to all your questions. Eve has held steady around 23k-30k players for the last 4 years or so. And you’ve got to remember that is on one single server.  Eve is dying, is a meme lol. It’s definitely viable for a new player to start. I’d recommend joining a newbro friendly Corp to help you learn the basics and get some free ships and friends :). Also get a referral code from someone as it comes with some bonus sp for you. Feel free to pm me if you want any help in game or finding a corp. good luck!
---
Shade is not a spy. A spy would not possibly be that overt about being on multiple comes constantly.
---
Why go to null when you can drop on stuff in low sec without risk?
---
Ok lol
---
That sounds like a really fun and well executed fight right until the 22 carriers pop up on the BR.
---
Our jump bridge network cuts a staggering 12 minutes off the trek from 1dq to clown ring. Wow, so scary, much projection.
---
Maybe too much spodbraining? This button USED to show they solar system on the map (old or new), but CCP happened to it I guess. You click it and magically the map opened, locating the system on the map. Although I submitted tickets 1 month ago, no word so far.
---
I have a little red riding hole ;)
---
How much isk does a VNI get botting 23 hours a day?
---
To me that used to be the fastest way to see where  a linked system is, what JBs lead to it etc, but CCP said no.
---
This is a fair assessment and I agree.
---
&gt;fleetcom.space 
---
Yeah, no.
---
This is the gameplay CCP (consciously or not) have embraced .
---
Upvoted you just for the good BR tool
---
u the mvp
---
Saving this
---
To be fair, I was on an interceptor feeding streak last night :D
---
didn't know shade was an avarr alt
---
Found the bug when I was trying to find where Placid is days ago
---
Why hello, it's me, Kefflin
---
&gt; Dropped:	871,535.18 ISK
---
lol
---
None exist. Due to copyright issues, only CCP can sell them. I'm not sure what CCP's take on the legality of commissioning the 3d printing and painting of a model is. There's enough precedent to crush them that it's not a sale - the model's still "for personal use", you're paying only for machine time, materials, and labour. That said if CCP is making a stink about that, our lawyers have better things to do than beat up their lawyers over a few hundred bucks of shop time.
---
Aurum came after Incarna. 
---
I first started playing \_because\_ of those Jita riots.
---
So you mean having to make some JF work to deploy in a place where we would need to JC every time we want to do some cool stuff ? 
---
Dude listen, from what I understand you are just a F1 monkey who live in some random renter corp or any kind of alliance with less than 2 constellation, I know you can't understand how basic mechanics work, and by mechanics I mean how a corp work
---
Thank you, that's a lot more helpful.
---
They're just too fun
---
If at least super/titan would fit in this damn gate I would understand the hate, but that's just some cry baby who are not happy when they see the alliance they attack form up to kill them and use jump gate as an excuse
---
Agreed- which is why I'm surprised people *still* think it's not slow enough.
---
Well done CCP. Fuck em.
---
&gt;Also attackers pretty much never should have 6+ jump bridges to attack, they'd typically stage from the border rather than their deepest krablands. 
---
Same for defender you got my bait, jump gate are only effective when you are not deploy and want some laid back pvp from your home without having to commit to a deployment, which I think you never ever did (the logistic part I'm talking)
---
Fair point.
---
Aw, I'm glad they do/did that. I wasn't looking forward to busting out of null only to come back and setup a cyno chain out of there for my other guys.
---
It would have been an annoying return back after winning Eve.
---
I'm gonna call bullshit. Not without a Plex injection you didn't.
---
CCP: You cannot, because we do not like to distribute merch, but if you do we might ban you for not using our official vendors.
---
So how did they buy them then?
---
I'd say a black screen undocking or a gate with trash can be scarier moments,  it's their own fault if they don't have an insta dock BM on a station.
---
I don’t see ten freaky girls though.
---
Putting aside the staggeringly hilarious professional victimhood on display here, this shit is hardly new. We have been operating on a strict policy of "get these shitlers the hell out of our space" since 2010. Probably earlier, but I can't attest to anything before then.
---
Some of your mouse motion suggests to me you are playing with a trackpad, is that the case? Great frags and music :)
---
&gt;I plex 6 accounts with only PI and extracting them.
---
You can bot trit in HS to cover it.
---
&gt;The people plexing are not the little guy, its the rich people that can afford 2b,3b or even 4b for a month of plex. 
---
Botting makes people rich.
---
There's been a few 3d printed ships in the sub. Pretty good looking ones as well. I think some even released the file for the printer.
---
His first mistake was sending this to Dark Spectrum, those dudes would sell their firstborns into the organ trade to please Snuff.
---
Send me 500 and i upvote this Post. IG: Slutty McSlutface
---
Opened 3 random ishtar kms.
---
Top damage ~20 carriers.
---
Nice br, but I don't think you keeping your fleet in "EMP optimal" mattered at all lol.
---
Telling people their motivation or telling them there lying about there motivations tends to be only effective on the audience. 
---
But fuck it you do the hard work you have 5 nano cruisers a biforst and a token garmur with high-grade snakes named xxx360noscope because garmur pilots always have amazing toon names. 
---
Now you tell me how you go around finding a fight.

Corps to look into at the start are E-Uni, Signal Cartel, Pandemic Horde, and Brave Newbies. I’m sure there’s more, but those are the only ones I know of that are actually good. Just look them all up, join their in game recruitment channels, and see which one you think you’d like the most. And don’t be afraid to bounce around between them, no one will hold that against you.

Corps to specifically avoid would be anything in Theran Alliance, or anything based in hisec.

Literally called buying a ship at a lower price, then selling it for higher.  You should look in to it.
