Second this.  OP is trying to start shit and I don't know who nor care.
---

---
All I can say is that things happened and he took responsibility for them then left.    We wanted him to stay.    Nobody had any ill will towards him at all including those who have been here from the beginning.   
---
I'll still play the Lee song just for him.   &lt;/3

No problems here: [https://i.imgur.com/iNyXLhv.png](https://i.imgur.com/iNyXLhv.png)

o7 new bravebro!
---
Welcome to your new obsession :)
---
Is that the unironic '*didn't want that sov anyway'*?
---
You wish him to stay whilst ousting him from the top position of a baby he created/ Are you guys smoking crack? No-one would want to stay after being flipped on like that, even if it's for the betterment of the corp, it's humiliating
---
Are you surprised? Eve is the only game since 2003 to run full second server ticks
---
His argument is actually that hunting would be easier without local. I'm sorry if you didn't train reading comprehension to 5.
---
Is there some meaning behind the number 754? Or is that just what you had for Plex?
---
LOL
---
Would it, though? Would the risk-averse krabs (90% of nullsec residents tbh) *really* be undocking more if they didn't even know if there was a fleet cloaked or offgrid waiting for them?
---
Bookmark all valid sites you find. 3/10, 4/10, Lookout, Watch, Vigils. All of them. After a while you'll start to notice that some systems just give more than others and some areas are just better than others. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The more data points you collect the clearer the picture becomes. It's a long term strategy.
---
Likewise. Thank you CCP. The CPU usage drop is significant.
---
&gt;Would it, though? Would the risk-averse krabs (90% of nullsec residents tbh) really be undocking more if they didn't even know if there was a fleet cloaked or offgrid waiting for them?
---
because the other things I mentioned:
---
nullsec anomalies would be more profitable, and systems would be more dense. It can be equally safe, as long as people try and make it safer.
---
CCP 2019 in a nutshell.
---
not just alliance  remember deadmines are there.
---
&gt;nullsec anomalies would be more profitable,
---
Yeah I'm done talking to you.
---
Ah ok, I farm 2-3 constellations along the Essence/Verge Vendor/Genesis border, I run hideaway/refuge for the 3/10s and faction spawns while scanning for unrated/deds.
---
Won't Darkness take the sov?
---
Genuine question for you guys. I have always considered myself decent with pcs, build my own tower etc. Software i am a little fuzzy on.
---
Can anyone ELI5 why 64 bit client is better than 32?
---
Cheers
---
Well when your corp is based on a racist meme and run by a racist shitlord...
---
&gt;then it would have to drain all fuel. 
---
If the repair cycle triggering caused a fuel usage then you could drain all the fuel by repeatedly triggering the rep timer and then letting it run out.
---
By description they are created by four empires, but on CCP's official screenshots they still have the Triglavian insignia
---
Already filed a bug report
---
A 32-bit client only uses a single core of your processor. 
---
The 64-bit processor will use multiple cores/threads, balancing out the load with less reliance on single-core speed.
---

---
it's okay, i've refuted like a dozen of your points so it's not like you have much of an argument left other than "hurr ur thing exists already in wormholes"
---
welcome to eve
---
How much SP do both toons have, may I ask?
---
Will Gobbins pay the 40 faction forts to sort now ??
---
I have less issue with being able to set the time than I do being able to set time AND day. 4am on a Saturday is much more doable  for many people than 4am on a Tuesday.
---
:(
---
uh... No? Nothing to do with the cores in use.
---
yes.   it would be longest airplane ever.
---
was thinking about  sea vessel too. but then ccp would lawsuit me for building floating  praxis model.
---
We should donate PLEX to load into this thing. Fill it to the brim!
---
was it in past  jita 4-1 ?
---
Try Harder.
---
I'm getting curious as to just how bling a Moros could be. How much is an ultra bling Vehement? Might be willing to trade a fishing trip in Alaska next summer (too late this year).
---
They've got their own coalitions, and together we form the Mango Imperial Legacy of F.I.R.E. (MILF for short).
---
I don't have a dog on either side of this fight, but the amount of tryhard in this post is why I don't tell other adults that I play this game.
---
There's a few reasons.
---
The important one is that it can use more memory than the 32 bit one. in some situations, this can allow you to avoid crashes.
---
It _also_ provides a minor performance boost, by running natively in the OS you're using, rather than with another layer to let the 32 bit software run. 
---
(CCP's probably also taken the opportunity to get some updates for libraries, which may have a performance gain)
---
Make sure you're not starting up another copy of the launcher when that happens. 
---
(when you 'close' the launcher, it normally goes to the system tray)
---
a lot of the shit that comes from -=The Imperium=- is really tryhard and cringey, much like their name
---
Oh I tell people, but I just say "it's complicated you wouldn't understand" and leave it at that
---
that is totaly false
---
&gt; reward balancing may be an issue 
---
I haven't done them at all yet.  What is the current reward mechanic for invasions?
---
Is there a reason for the number 754 plex and I'm just dense? Also I'm sorry about your loss.
---
This....here isn't complicated.  It's embarrassing.
---
Sarcasm
---
cringe.
---
hi! thanks for your comment!
---
This tackle should qualify as an example of an advanced tackle since it overcame the maximum anti-tackle capability by a maxed out blinged Orthrus, and successfully defanged him and put him in stable pointed state.  hope u liked it!
---
This sounds exactly like they have NOT finished the following stage, and use this statement to buy time to me. 
---
Listen, it is fine to release the game unfinished and/or being early access. However this expansion is more an free DLC than actual game. I think I have the right to at least experience a fully functional game play flow. 
---
The worst thing is CCP arranged a 40 hour community steam, and content is NOT available for some streamers cause there is NO INVASION going on.
---
Sounds like Twitch support.
---
If this is about a compromised account or similar account issues they investigate those thoroughly before responding.
---
Great video. Genuinely enjoyed watching it.
---
Ninja salvage other people's shit is the meta right now
---
This does not sound logical to me. In either real-life military concept or game design concept, having the first invasion as the biggest and most active is more logical. By the story the triglavian forces stupidly announced there attack, which means they should be prepared. If we have all 3 levels ready, my personal opinion is to have a rapidly forming 1st invasion, and while players are dealing with the first one, 2nd and 3rd invasion show up and start to establish in a slower manner, granting player more time (or probably can be stopped by player in early stages).
---
Like other guys said, you’ll be fine. Make sure though that in the options under “optimize settings” you click “optimize for performance”. Sound off also helps, as does keeping your overview clean and local minimized in crowded systems (1000+)

Insta-undock and gate bounces are one of the most important things you can have. The latter more for null than hi-sec but honestly Jita is the most dangerous system in the game.

What you can do is have the MJD and 1 or more warp core stabilizers in your lows.
---
The dst already comes with +2 warp core stability, so it takes 4 points to hold you down with only one stab.
---
I had 3 guys pointing me the other day with one stab and my dst just warped away as I laughed.
---
Always try to warp away in a dst when you are pointed, never just give up.

Thats not how the history of this corp was started. Two C4 groups wanted to merge, and to keep any issues from arising in the beginning, those two respective leaders agreed that Lee would be a good focal point and middle man to take the title of "CEO" with the understanding that he would not be and is not the "keymaster" for the whole show.. One of the groups left for their own reasons. So him "creating" it is misinformation to say the least. Everyone on day 1 created it, not solely him. With that said, as time goes on and adult things happen, people cannot devote enough time and attention or sometimes their mental/emotional state needs a break from it. All directors unanimously decided that he needed to focus on other things and not be spread thin as it would be detrimental to all the members if it progressively had gotten worse. So to call it "his baby" and a "flip" is inaccurate to say the least. . . Mind you none of the Directors or members of this corp PUBLICLY outed him for this or any of the internal issues that led to it as we actually wanted to look out for the betterment of him in game and IRL, you can see clearly that he did this himself in a public channel so the humiliation is entirely on a single person at that point.

Side note I once bought a badger for 608m on a market scam. This was before warnings about over priced items and was 10 years ago so that was about 2.5 - 4 plex. Which have now been broken into 500 pieces from the original. Never thought I'd come back from that

The fact that people trade in Jita/Perimeter, 2 systems out of all of hisec, and 1 activity, does not mean hisec is relevant. I see you still have nothing to back up your claim that all the PVP is done in Forge.

I'm just showing you that you're so lazy that you could have figured this out a YEAR ago and you went spouting your mouth off like a hiseccer.  It was true then, it is true now.  You've had a year to know.

If you look at their corp page, it now has their EU Commander listed as Nina Glutdrache and their USTZ Commander is listed as Nina Fyerdrache. I saw that last night and laughed out loud.
---
Yes, ships move through space. Which is the entire point of those numbers. Now look at what you can actually get in hisec, and how little PVP is actually done in hisec, and realise that your shitty krab haven is irrelevant.

Their killboard indicates that they already have.

Hey, you know the Cockroach? Not selling on the open market, or in contracts, but I think it's a special ship given out to CCP or CSM members. 500m shield and armor and 1b hull, 99.9% resists to everything, 8 highs 8 meds 8 lows, and SOMEONE ACTUALLY LOST ONE.
---
It sounds like you might enjoy a wormhole corp. I'd recommend at least trying it out. There's still a bit of blueing, but it's usually very temporary and based on a common enemy (i.e. k-space).
---
22 days is plenty of time to be thorough enough especially taking my hard earned money for digital pixels... lets just be honest here

I work graveyard shift, and am normally passed out at this time. But, I might have to alarm clock it to at least watch. Sorry for everything that's happened to ya man. But, us Eve nerds come together when needed for something good. And, I'd say that this is pretty darn good.

You need positive base stats with the faction whose militia you are planning on joining in order to join. Base stats are the stat before skills like Social, Diplomacy, Connections, etc. are taken into account.

---
&gt;Yes, ships move through space. Which is the entire point of those numbers
---
You're learning.  
---
What are those ships doing, sweetie?  Just moving around randomly, right?  Oh, wait, they're *feeding the market*, you know, exactly like I said.

If only CCP had an existing system to base that off of. Something like player owned custom offices...
---
I get the feeling reality is not your strong suit.
---
If you think this is crying you must think you are a lot bigger and scarier than you are.
---
These aren't tears, this is laughter
---
Among the frigate choices for PvE you have:
---
T1: Kestrel, Tristan
---
Navy Faction: Hookbill, Slicer can be done but it's very difficult to work with
---
T2: All of the assault frigates have their place depending on what exactly you're doing. Retributions and Hawks are popular choices
---
Pirate: Worm, maybe Succubus with beams
---
Since you asked about T1 frigates, the Kestrel is decent. A long time ago I used one to run Mul-Zatah Monasteries (DED 4/10) with one that would reach out to 90km and avoid all damage. Don't do this: once you become a Vet you can't handle the &gt;1 hr grind. (I've also done a Sansha 5/10 in a Caracal. Also not recommended. Level 4 missions in a AF are cakewalk in comparison. I'm a regular user of bombers for certain escalations.) You'll want light missiles. 
---
The Tristan can work the same but relies more on drones. I'd run a shield setup. Mind you I haven't run Abyssal content beyond the test server before it came out. I hate the depth of field fudgery. Here's a Kestrel fit: if you've got good fitting skills, you can upgrade the guidance computer to a T2.

Again change the hardener and screen reinforcer to your local flavor of rat. The highs are your taste. You could also run polycarbons in the rigs in place of the CDFEs. You could also depending on your tank relative to the site, drop the hardener in the mids for a drone navigation computer. I'm sure you could also make an afterburner fit using polycarbons or what not. Or even a 10MN setup. Whatever.
---
The Hookbill, as has been suggested by someone else, is also a great ship for PvE. However I find it suffers from chronic fitting problems, and if this ship is up your way, then so is the Hawk (which also suffers from fitting problems).
---
That is a strange issue. 2-3 for eve is really strange while mining I play pubg while I mine and never see it chug down to 2-3 sounds like a cpu bottleneck.
---
True. Just have them on standby to drop on anybody that wants to ruin this. *coughcough*snuff*coughcough*.

I will be more than happy to blow you up on memory of someone else.

Yes. So much racism in that shekelsquad. Chance was right.
---
&gt; What are those ships doing, sweetie? Just moving around randomly, right? Oh, wait, they're feeding the market, 
---
The only people who buy from amarr/dodixie/rens are drooling retards trying to get themselves scammed. Ships travelling doesn't make space relevant?
---
You claimed that The Forge is the heart of PVP. That claim is incredibly inaccurate, yet here you are completely lacking any form of self-awareness over it. I can't take your "education" and "intelligence" seriously when you're saying all that shit while also claiming HISEC is the heart of PVP.
---
And considering how few resources are brought to you by hisec, it's just fucking irrelevant. You picking a shitty metric (ships moving in space) and ignoring *literally everything else* to try and claim your shithole means something is about as intelligent as looking at the nearest kill whoring corp, saying look at their ISK efficiency from sending a t1 frig to other people's supercap fights, and ignoring that they have shit for ship and point efficiency. Cherrypicking the easiest metric to get and ignoring the fact that you're useless shit for everything else is just desperation.

I run on Linux and it was limited to about 1.6GB with the 32-bit client. Using the 64-bit client (haven't tested on a fleet yet) reduced it to 7% usage, which is around 1GB.
---
I was thinking the same.  But hey, I only have 104 plex in my vault.  So maybe that is what he has.  Maybe it is a special number,

But If I can I am gonna show up with some reps for the gent.

I hate steam reviews where someone with thousands of hours in a game shits on it when they are done with it.

lol no. What I'm saying is saying some stupid ass word doesn't automatically make you a racist and the reason anybody gives a fuck about that word is because it's thrown up as some giant untouchable monolith when in reality it's just another stupid word just like all the other stupid word. 
---
I seriously can't fucking stand it when people act as if somebody saying some forbidden word is the end of the world and even saying it in any context whatsoever just automagically means they believe this or that horrible thing. It's absolute fucking cancer and I can't wait for the day it gets stomped out.

That is what happens when emotions overtake logical thinking and listening skills. It was clearly stated and agreed upon by 6 other directors that he would still remain in some sort of directorship role, particularly in those areas where he thrived. (The recording that he leaked, does in fact have that stated in one way shape or form by many members) But honestly at this point with all the immature banter and emotion involved with it, I am bowing out and focusing on our guys and the community that we all built from day 1 together. Frankly, the emotions that are being displayed are what led to this in the first place. Some people want full control or none at all and in turn react in various ways, many times poorly to it,  maybe unit cohesion isn't their best quality....

Brainwashed liberal nazis have no value in reality, most of them cant even see reality, feelings and emotions and they wonder why they cant win. sad

I looked up some stuff on the wiki, and it doesn't matter how many stabs I have. Just having the scram on me will disrupt the MJD and the bubble prevents any warp anyway.

You’re right.

The pilot sighed, resigned to their fate they initiated the process of undocking for what they thought would be the last time.      As the massive Moros class Dreadnought cleared the docking bay and transitioned into open space its sensors came online, indicating to its pilot and sole occupant the heavy ship traffic in the area.  The pilot did not react, infact they had been expecting this.   
---
Less than a week prior they made a call out into the cosmos letting them know of something that is normally a closely held secret: The undocking of a capital vessel. An act that normally is met with meticulous planning and fervent security.  *"  I have no family, no children, no close friends, and no reason to continue my current course"*  The message had said.  It continued to highlight the specifics of exactly where and when this massive ship would be entering space. Vulnerable to attack without proper escort.  
---
Warning lights flashed as the automatic undocking protocol finished and the Moros Dreadnought completed its undocking procedure. With that, the safety protocol which prevented other ships from targeting the ship disengaged and the surrounding ships began activating a target lock on the Moros.     
---
Instead of explosions, the Moros began to receive buffs and repair beams being activated upon it.  A cloud of hundreds of repair drones of all sizes and types began to swarm around the Moros, contributing their little bit to the energies that were designed to maintain a ships integrity rather than destroy it.   A few renegade pirates who had hoped for an easy kill were instead quickly slaughtered by the Armada of ships that moved to form a protective honor guard around the Moros. 
---
The Pilot of the Moros was in shock.  They had expected a swift death, but instead, the capsuleers that had answered the call had come to offer aid and protection.    It was a breathtaking sight.
---
The pilot looked upon the ships forming around it a new signature came onto grid, at first it was not noticed due to the heavy traffic but then as it got closer it blocked the star light from hitting the moro's hull, casting a shadow on it and the entire honor guard fleet.
---
It was an Erebus class Gallente Titan, flanked by a full gallente battle fleet made up of hundreds of ships, including several Nyx Class Supercarriers which flanked the massive, multi kilometers long titan as it made its way closer to the Moros and its sole pilot.  
---
As the pilot watched, thinking that this fleet would easily brush away their moros and those who had formed the honor guard, a communication link was established from the Titan.
---
*"Greetings Captain. We heard your message and we came as soon as we could.  We bring a message to you now to let you know that You are not alone.  You say you have no family? Your family is all around you.  You said you have no children, your children are those who you have helped inspire to bigger and greater things and will move forward after following in your footsteps,  you say you have no close friends, well I can see from those around you that you have more friends than you know.   You are seen, you are heard, and you are not alone"*    The Admiral commanding the fleet said solemnly.  
---
And with that, the massive titan and its escort fleet moved and joined the honor guard formation.
---
The pilot was overwhelmed, but took the words of the gallente admiral to heart.    There were family here, there were friends and there were children could be helped.   The pilot smiled as their Moros continued on with the honor guard fleet for some time.  The pilots each took a turn expressing their feelings and desire to see the pilot succeed and thrive, and then one by one they saluted and broke away until the Moros was once again alone.    What had thought to be a short and violent end became a new and wonderful beginning. The pilot smiled and initiated a warp jump.  They were not sure what would come next, but they now knew that they were not alone.

Hi Kat!
---
There's your catch. Rookie ships now start with afterburner fitted, but they weren't years ago. So
---
1 trit per 10 seconds?
---
brb, making millions
---
So I guess it’s a more nuanced answer like most things in EVE. :) The scenario you are in matters. My scenario is I am jumping into my static, clearing a gas site of rats, then coming in my huffers to huff all the gas there. In this scenario the very best isk/hour you can get is if someone is on site giving mining boosts, and your in a venture/prospect with T2 huffers and mining frog V trained. The next best thing is a gnosis with 5 T2 huffers, it’s own mining boosts, and expanded cargo hold.
---
If you are jumping in from k-space ninja huffing it may be better in a venture/prospect because maybe the speed makes a big difference, harder to tackle, warp away from rats faster etc.
---
So I think it depends on your situation
---
What is it with all these random goon posters and their blistering takes? All these j4gs seem to posture a fucking lot with 60k nerds behind their back.
---
Lots of god ideas here, and I truly hope that this discussion results in some fruitful action. FW and low sec is what got me hooked on EVE, and its the one play style I want to come back to but Im done resubbing time and time again just to watch this area of the game get neglected as it grows more barren. Best of luck with your CSM campaign!
---
I agree, you definitely ended up with half a brain. Now run along and keep telling everyone that because you have 1 set of shitty numbers it doesn't matter that your space is useless garbage for anything else
---
nope me too, I was concerned it was just me, but I put the DST away for the night just in case.
---
It's still ridiculous. WoW players bitch if a ticket takes longer than 24 hours to be addressed. This dude is going 22 *days*. Even if it's a compromised account, that response time is pathetic.
---
You seem like a good dude.
---
reddit support will need more details in order to accurately be outraged about your problem
---
Thing is, the asymmetry of mineral distribution *still exists*, just not in sov ore anomalies. It is present in regular asteroid belts, which are based on where you are. For example, nullsec in the north does not have arkonor, and the south does not have bistot. There are a few very rare exceptions (-0.8 or better systems) but in general the restrictions are still there.
---
The issue with distribution is the sov anomalies which are identical no matter where you mine, with the only exceptions being higher yield asteroids.
---
Mineral distribution even when resolved through Jita wouldn't actually be so bad, as it would allow things like blockades and export bans to have an effect. Filling a JF cargohold with Noxcium is pretty awful to do in practice, since you can move 37 million and change units in a cargohold, but then you have to do it again and again and the effects are felt rather quickly.
---
Well, at least the video is entertaining.
---
Dude I fucking love the condor. First ship I trained for when I started playing in 2005 was a Crow. Used to orbit 15km and grind people down with my 80 dps. This was back before warp to zero and when speed tanking was mad op. 
---
This video gives me nostalgia and I love to see you winning in the condor. Always been a huge fan of the MSE/scram/web fits. I'm gonna fit some up and give it a shot.
---
Wow you're a dick
---
Usually when people do that it's because of an update or something that changes the game for the worse.
---
Thank you for posting a sick explanation and picture. This could be very helpful for people.
---
All of these reviews are *fucking hilarious.*
---
At least 2 thirds of the negative steam reviews are just hisec turbokrabs salty that PVP exists and god they're hilarious
---
Oh no, it's all real. They're completely fucking wrong, but their salt over the loss of their covetor loss in 1.0 space is real.
---
What's with that wide stretched out overview window?
---
Oh I know that, I meant the reviews in general as something to be considered before playing any game.
---
I will donate a Nyx if you can fly one, and somehow make it to the karma fleet keepstar. Then somehow make it vacj5to your destination system.
---
I was happy to pay for my resin megathron and I would happily pay for another ship.
---
Set a smartbomb off in hisec in a SIN

I mean, the mechanic would work everywhere, just wouldn't matter in low or null because you don't declare war in game there, you just attack.

"Hey TCU, we can go back to tenal now."

I call BS.  NC doesn't undock...

just take a look at initposting during rage, all he's doing is keeping the standards of the alliance.

i kind of expected the titan to say "ur gay pwnd" and DD the moros, not gonna lie.
---
Works Gobbins care?
---
“Collateral damage”
---
We don't want to fight a sov war that would be aids at best and a loss at worst? We still shoot each other. We ally up for ops when it's mutually beneficial and that's been often lately, but on any smaller level we shoot each other regularly.
---
Which guys? The rest of Legacy? IDFK. Pets.
---
Sounds like you do need to get over it, a good corp in eve will make you some connections that even if they break up, you'll carry on to your next corp.
---
For eve? Discord. For general comms? Encrypted IRC with its gateway on a vpn. It's as secure as I need it to be and I'm surprised more enterprise guys don't just do that. It basically runs itself and it's cheaper than a lot of other solutions.
---
Good luck!

I'm not so sure this guy is Imperium per se. I think he just lost a cyno alt and got super salty about it.
---
ahaha "уу китайцы вообще охуели" = "And Chinese have become daring"... That's a very polite and high-minded translation indeed. I think based on this, I can translate the conversation as follows:
---
Vk Nolen: "You are not who I wanted to see"  
---
Vk Nolen: "It would seem that the Chinese have become daring"  
---
Raptor Darine: "Have you made him suffer?"  
---
Vk Nolen: "No, alas, Lufax's speed has exceeded mine"  
---
Vk Nolen: "But his drones did meet an end by my hand"  
---
Raptor Darine: "A most sorrowful of times, worthy of no fewer than three  open parentheses to describe"  
---
Vk Nolen: "I will no despair! Unfortunately, the only ones willing to accept a fair challenge by combat are those with most excellent skills, exceeding mine"  
---
Vk Nolen: "Lucy Mandler is the lowly target I had hoped to engage in what I was hoping to be a player versus player contest skewed heavily in my favor"  
---
Vk Nolen: "Lady luck was on his side tonight though as I, unfortunately, stepped away at an inopportune time"  
---
Raptor Darine: "There is still a chance that he will find me a worthwhile target and fight me"  
---
Lucy Mandler: "u wot m8"
---
You’re just meant to take stainguy for his word, clearly the goon CSM candidate wants (and has always wanted) changes that negatively impact goon play style
---
Employee some Mercs to do it for you, or set an alarm i guess vOv
---
This would actually be a decent idea, but you would have to massively lower the repping to maybe 1 or 2 t2 logi max.
---
A fax is an absurd amount of reps to have to put at risk for a stricture half the cost.
---
honestly, the danger is what makes this game fun. sitting around doing "safe" stuff is just not fun. The constant "look over your shoulder" feeling that EVE gives you is what makes the game fun. There is no fun without challenge and that is what this game gives you!
---
thou super tempting, this is also my industrial and mining toon so, not sure I want to part with it.
---
Betas and alphas are a thing.
---
CCP is horrible at...well, most things, but the NPE is one of the worst of those things.
---
Every new player add one more to the lifeblood of this incredibly complex galaxy called New Eden. May you never cease to find something that interest you here. May you also one day pay forward the help you get, to the next new face, who's lost in some system that is in reality, much closer than you think.

Anyways the point being I can afford up to an orca and was wondering is the porpoise a good solo miner I'm wanting to go on the cheaper side and was wondering what's the best miner in game besides the rorqual I'm in highsec and want to make my own ships. What has the best ore output after all bonuses?
---
A XO that was asked to step down reinforced one of our refineries on his way out.

Don't worry OP, at least one person got that reference.

You've come to the right place, friend.

Ya know.. I haven't played in a bit, but I think I will log in for this and hop in there with a basilisk. Should be fun. Don't ever give up man. I wanted to give up myself until recently.. You are bringing joy to people's lives with your streams and videos and I'm sure you brought a lot of joy to Paola as well. The goal of getting to support yourself from youtube and streaming is awesome and I'm confident you will be able to do it. You may even get a lot farther than you expect!
---
Happy flying to you!
---
I would give the same review
---
I played Eve for thousands of hours so you don't have to go through the same suffering
---
NC would have been able to almost ignore this incursion but some genius re timed NC's SOV structures to AUTZ. There should be some good late night content, and I'll be amazed if SV &amp; Snuff doesn't sneak in a few dreads to the area.
---
The bit about banning part of the internet across your necksnapping country doesn't help with any comparisons that may or may not be being made
---
[removed]
---
Make 6/10s lowsec only content.
---
il give a 5/7
---
Not for long, lol
---
And typical griefer statement that does nothing to further the discussion. All in all I don't mind being hated. I love the pvp aspect of the game. However, this event's main money maker being taken from people working for it without penalty to the thief, at least a feasible one, is something probably most of the players can't take. It costs a lot of us ammo to do these with little to no reward due to a broken mechanic.
---
6/8
---
I've had dozens of tickets responded to within a day, have you sent follow up messages?
---
Weird Flex but ok
---
The OP posted his fit already, 4 hours before this comment.
---
2/5
---
Not sure how much you know so here's a few quick things for you:
---
* Upwell structures are replacing POSs, which are in the process of being phased out. These new structures have shields which are always vulnerable, but then have armor and shield timers which are set by the defender. The final timer comes out on the _time and day_ of the defender's choosing for a 15 minute window. 
---
* The old POS system was different and a bit less obvious in how it worked. By putting a certain amount of strontium clathrates into your POS you could set a timer of varying length to happen after it was reinforced. This could be gamed* by attackers for example by intentionally hitting it during off hours so it would come out for final timer during primetime. Their reinforce times were also not nearly as long. In general however these were usually stronted in such a way attackers would attack it once, then be forced to come back in their off hours if it was timezone tanked. Compare to the new citadel mechanics which require two such timers and no control over the time they come out.
---
* CCP has updated the wardec system so that war aggressors must declare a highsec structure they own as their HQ. Killing this structure ends the war for the defenders and prevents a new one for 2 weeks. With the goal of giving defenders a cool way to actually fight back.
---
* Many groups set their structure timers to Australian timezone to make attacking them miserable - due to the way their timers function. This makes killing these structures much more difficult for US/EU based groups as the AUS timezone has the lowest daily activity.
---
OP (me) is pointing out how these new wardec changes fall short in light of the way Upwell structure timers currently work - as wardec'ing corporations can simply timezone tank their structures to make fighting back more difficult.
---
you can:
---
they removed stront based timers
---
My thought exactly. Hopefully, it will all be destroyed and not dropped!
---
Alright DEQC SPIAS
---
yeah me too, plus UK based, got kicked twice. was out doing fleet stuff. comms stayed up so defo eve related
---
Typically I have dualboxed a Procurer and a Porpoise, both balanced between cost, yield, and tank.
---
The procurer would mine about the same as the porpoise, but when boosted by the porpoise the yield was about 30% higher.
---
So if you only had to use one, I would probably go with porpoise, even if the yield was a bit lower, you have sooo much more cargo space for less trips to the station.
---
Just remember folks they're winning the war. You think that people want FUN in this game? Ha, mittens is the definition of fun. He has an entire coalition grinding abandoned structures right now!
---
Are you guys using printers using filament or are they printed using resin? If filament , have you checked out resin 3d printed ones ? I think a resin print of the ships would be very cool.
---
If you're running multiple alts at the same time, they're omega. Put the drag bubble 100km away from the citadel, then kill them all as you bring an alt which the bots haven't whitelisted before, so they warp to the citadel, get dragged into the bubble, and killed.
---
They use out of corp recruiters to pull in random new players from the starter NPC corps.
---
I'm all for it.
---
Unfortunately wouldn't be able to find RL nerds to play it with :c
---
And they shouldn't.
---
We have sov in Tenal?
---
It was "titans" and to say nothing came of it is stupid. I was on the BB venture fleet, and we had a lot fun.
---
I do want to eventually multibox but right now itd probably be just me and my cousin singleboxing. So a porpoise would be better then for that right? Plus I'd eventually have it for multiboxing.
---
It could be a pop-up when you attack, or it could be something the Alliance or corp sets beforehand
---
I'm so used to the botters virtualizing all the alphas that I forgot you officially can't do that.
---
slash dot dash dot slash dot dash dot slash dot dash dot slash dot com
---
It's not even "ninja" salvaging at this point, they can just sit there and laugh in your face while they salvaging your kills, there's nothing stealthy or skillful about it.
---
Especially if your fleet has logi, who get aggro 90% of the time.
---
Sort of ruins the content for me.
---
The comments have been quite entertaining at least
---
Judging by the trend of comments you might have to sd it before the next dt.
---
Fly unsafe
---
Wouldn't do anything to a holding corp unfortunately.
---
The attacker.
---
Seems like the same thing is happening with regular regular ratting as well. I haven’t tested the response above me, but hoping it’s the same.
---
Hmm, yeah I suppose. But that sounds like requiring a war to attack structures in _all_ space... Unless I'm totally not understanding.
---
https://evemarketer.com/ doesn't hand you that information, but it's the best starting point for gathering it that I know of.
---
It will run Eve, CSGO and Dota just fine but you will be limited in your other gaming options and end up running most stuff on low settings. You do need SSD though, just to keep you sane during startup.
---
I mean, that is more fun than staying docked up until the end of the war.
---
Nah, just a preset adjustment.
---
Alliance A has their cits at 0500 eve
---
Alliance B attacks and has their 'Alliance Activity Preset' to 2200 eve
---
An adjustment is made according to some formula that (because CCP) makes everybody miserable.
---
Doable hawks
---
You have a very odd definition of a war.
---
Again, I don't know what bots you've seen, but this only works as a thought experiment. The citadels are all gunned and there are actual players at the keyboard to check now and then.
---
If the bubbles are within 350km, they'll get shot at by the structure. If they're further out than 350km, they'll log in some human characters to go pop them.
---
Have you.... ever hunted bots? Or is this just one of those armchair theorycrafting things? Where are you finding such dumb bots?

"asshole millennial syndrome" You do know that these activities have been performed by people before millennials could even walk, right? It's not some new thing or something that's come about in the last couple years. It has been a part of the game since day one.

Can confirm, easily doable with hawks in both a mwd and ab setup. Darks only tho.
---
It's already fitted on the ship you start out with here's what it looks like (white can in a circle with blue flames coming out of it on the right of the capacitor) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5kFc6puOH4
---
Yours will be a 1MN afterburner cuz there's different sized but it'll look and work the same.

This guy triple boxes Hawks in T5 and makes damn good isk.
---
&gt; We don't want to fight a sov war that would be aids at best and a loss at worst?
---
Not talking about NIPs here.
---
&gt; We ally up for ops when it's mutually beneficial and that's been often lately, but on any smaller level we shoot each other regularly.
---
In other words, bluetral allies. The second largest group in the game allied to the largest.
---
" He has an entire coalition grinding abandoned structures right now!"
---
Does that include the structures that horde just abandoned in delve after giving up their attempt to counter invade because they fedi a few fleets and ran back to Tribute?
---
Should remove roles before you get burned
---
If your goal is to get in big battles, absolutely ignore the guy who suggested at least twice that you do highsec missions.  Read reddit a bit, join one of the big groups (basically Karmafleet or Pandemic Horde) and move on in.  Groups are incredibly welcoming for new players, will have tons of guides and people willing to help, and will actually get you involved with what your stated goal is.
---
It's time to get the armor logi skills
---
That processor was like 7 or 8 years old.  Reasonable graphics tho.  You can 5 box easy but no reason to buy old hardware like this
---
Find Sagarys and fly tackle for his Vindi in GE standing fleet. Kills will be had.

MUH KILLBOARD RATIO

3/50

Whether it's contested or not, whether it's in Delve or Tribute, whether it's PanFam or Imperium, winning is winning.
---
While fun is delicious icing on the cake, the only thing that really matters in war is who and what is left.
---
&gt; Eve does not have micro transactions.
---
it very much fucking does, do you know what a plex is and what you can do with it?
---
True. It just wasn't nearly as accepted as it currently is. Then again we also had the ability to shoot the ass wipes before concord came along.
---
Ya it really does. I wish ccp had thought the loot through better, that or made it so salvaging/looting someone else's stuff got you concorded before making it the most valuable part of the new content.

Oil company. First thing I thought of when I saw this. Drilled a few wells for them over the years. Didn’t know they played eve!

Did you fit a (medium!!) shield extender and an adaptive invuln on your Venture? My recollections of highsec mining is that I never had trouble with rats once I learned to fit tank modules onto my ships.
---
Why?
---
Every time I go into a wormhole, I assume that I'm not going to make it out alive. Sometimes, I do. And because I assume that I'm not, the value of the ship that I went in with is generally significantly less than whatever cargo I picked up in there.
---
An alpha?
---
You need to spare 40mills isk and start huffing gas. you gonna need a lot of reading for that. Read about wormhole, and its gas sites in it. Read about scanning and probing.
---
Its a huge gap between highsec miasmo mining, to venture gas huffing in vital instrumental gas sites. Might even gets your first plex.
---
Then snuffed out decloaks a nyx.
---
Furry. SergalJerk. The feels
---
Now, that's something even PanFam should join.
---
Discord invite is expired.
---
So far it's only happened in three places, one of which has been cleared. It is also currently limited to HS (though one of them spawned close enough to LS that one LS system was effected). Honestly, there isn't enough information to say for certain one way or another.
---
That's certainly going to reduce the amount of money that I have available to spend on Games Workshop products.

Get the fuck outta here. Really?

Imagine still wearing the tinfoil hat after the pie chart of shame. I mean, not that I expected you to have any connection to reality.

you should be less active on reddit and put efforts in game ... we could have *fun* together

I liked this joke the first time around when it was about ASCN.

Is copying and research still possible to do in a POS?

Don't really get on eve much anymore, had a lot of fun when I did. These posts always tear me up.

was gonna say, getting chased out of delve by welp squad with their tails between their legs, delves been fucking silent for a few days now

2018, bro youre a year out with this
---
Mobile depots are your small citadels, and even these motherfuckers have a 1-day timer.

lmao Darkness will maybe undock a few corms. If anything RR would take it, rest of GOTG is a joke
---
I think these ships need to have bounties on them I mean it makes sense why would concord not put bounties on an invading force.
---
At least that way the people taking part who lets face it 90% of them wont be getting any loot with all the small shit just hugging stuff to ninja it when it pops.
---
Put bounties on the triglavian's /ccppls
---
big words for a worthless f1 pusher that probably don't even know how most of your doctrines works.
---
Remember the same thing happened in 2016 and you all where doing the same as what I’m doing. Keep that in mind
---
you mean the pie chart that showed a pretty new goon entity with 2% while entities that have rented out system for much longer and have been owned by multiple alliances over the years had more?
---
Yeah, those numbers doesn't mean shit before they release year by year statistics
---
ah shit I put the last time goon got slaughtered my b
---
no because paying your enemy is just as retarded now as it was when sort did it

---
Tis, twitch and so on
---
dude theres alliances that dont exist on that BR like BIA or MC or PL
---
Same here earlier.
---
Can a newbro ask for an explanation why is that important?
---
To give even more context:
---
I saw an Incursus and Catalyst on D-Scan. Tried to engage the Incursus in the Novice, but he warped off. I figured that with dual web I have enough range control to engage the Catalyst in the small.
---
Yep, I did: https://zkillboard.com/kill/76997316/ 
---
While still fighting the catalyst, the Incursus warped in: https://zkillboard.com/kill/76997343/
---
Afterwards that conversation happened
---
Fit for retribution that could fly a t3? Please
---
I think there is an option to toggle this
---
Good. I hope the North burns
---
It’s one jump outside of the biggest trade hub in the game. It’s very highly traveled, and the only(I think?) keepstar in HS is located there and a lot of trading is done out of it.
---
This comment is so poetic, I love it! And I truly hope I can pay forward all the help I've received from this wonderful community! And yes. Here's to many more capsuleers to come!
---
Your definition of war changes to whatever suits your damage control narrative
---
Sorts alliance is thriving...the rest of the north is being bent over without lube and it wont stop until mittens and the wizard hat says so...
---
Lorenzo our lord and saviour
---
Hey, you may not like Sort for all the backstabbing he has done, but still, this is the kind of stuff that keeps EVE interesting!
---
Your flair suits you moose :P
---
...cargo transfer?
---
Must be new
---
so you dicked about on grid for 15 minutes, killed a bunch of drones and then got owned.   
---
Sounds like small gang action to me, it's true. 
---
I mean, my experience with this is that if you give them too much time on grid, they will prepare the countergank and you'll be fucked. Small gang  + staying stationary = death
---

---
Triglavian incursion in starter systems seems to be an interesting decision. (Triglavians in Kisogo, the best starter system ever.)
---
*narrator voice*
---
And that’s exactly what happened.

Can I queue up different ammo to be loaded in my guns? Currently I have to stop firing and then select ammo to load.

Would be hilarious if they'd warp into the starter Mission.

I got booted 5 times from a fleet because i had a Noctis, 30+ players fleets
---
This post aged poorly lmao
---
Still proud of this lmao
---
lol, now i have to make a new alt to try that :D
---
What framerate did you get?
---
They probably had enough salvagers already. :)
---
New NPCs that are invading the galaxy. It's basically new PVE content that got introduced just a couple days ago and we're still figuring out.
---
was just me and another Noctis,
---
Yeah sure they would be up there when it comes to models but consider the audience for something like this. EVE players are not your avg 16 year old so even a higher pricetag should not be much of an issue considering how high quality these things seem to be.
---
Well, yeah... It always depends on the FC. Most of FC'S i have flown with are ok, but there will always be a dickhead. Or two...
---

  /r/eve: "THIS IS TERRIBLE"
---
Same, rather pleased with the 64-bit client. In a fleet op last night, gfx set to quality throughout and audio turned on! A lot of tidi due to number of dudes in local (2000+, client wont fix tidi) but the client held well. fps hoovered around 30-40 average, some dips in fps and RAM maxed out at 2.8GB.
---
I'd be interested to see a compassion between 32-bit and 64-bit client on the same grid.
---
It's not about that, just the two alliances claiming it's not a necessity and yet they are part of their own local blue donut. Just wanted to clarify.
---
Well, that was embarrasing

Nice job trying to use this to further your in-game grudges.
---
It's the best performing tidi fight I have been in, those using 64bit have also said the same.
---
Great fight, thank you PanFam for showing up! It was a lot of fun.
---
jita triglavian hotdrop when?
---
Because someone posted like an idiot in 2016 you should do so in 2019?
---
Oh I forget this is reddit, so okay I Guess.
---
Not actually accurate.
---
The single threaded  it is the solar system simulation, on the server. There are threads used elsewhere.
---
Glassing means something rather different in the working class parts of the UK
---
1500 man battles are definitely not what people want, and is not a sign of a active null.
---
Yeah, I was going to keep watching to figure out how it's done but it's unbearable...
---
Good player too.  Been in more than a few fleets with me before I decided to win at the game. Very long time player too.  Fleets going back at least 7 years back if not much longer.
---
Lol that's just life  go find another HQ in your TZ to shoot.. fuck..
---
We have it confirmed that NC and hangers on, cannot fight goon super fleet. Validated by the mere fact they cannot drop whilst goons in range. Once out of range they are confident in use. 
---
Goonies just run them through already.
---
You dropped the /s
---
no u
---
Yea, it sucks when your opponent doesn't just feed to you but fights back.
---
You're right, thousands of players all fighting a war isn't a sign of an active null.
---
Question for goons: Why not bring in the supers? Fight would easily have been won for you
---
Ye i live in that city lol
---
They got waterboarded...
---
Sure, supercaps could have been brought into it... if both coalitions wanted to be there for a further 12 hours.
---
I've said for a while this is their way of forcing the hibernating players in highsec out of highsec by throwing wrenches into their day to day play.
---
This is going to piss SO many people off. 
---
I love it!
---
Its not. 
---
There used to be fights and small scale wars everywhere. 
---
Now, if there is a fight, everyone and their dog is there. A active null would mean that there is actually something happening in more than 2 regions. one fight with 1500 is less active than 10 fights with 100 people.
---
I was sitting around 40-60fps with occasional drops when things like bubbles went up.
---
Had sound off, brackets hidden, potato mode, local closed, and all effects off.
---
so the new client was in the latest patch? guess thats why eve ran so smoothly last night
---
So SH1 ihub isn't worth that?
---
Wdym they got waterboarded? Their supers mided and were ready to go in
---
thats the spirit
---
Haha wow... Apparently if you disable post processing it goes back to normal, maybe try that 😉
---
Only of you opted in for the 64bit client beta.
---
You need to activate it in the settings of the launcher
---
derp
---
guess ill blame my new omen laptop then
---
Speaking of feeding, my Jackdaw isn't hungry anymore
---
No, all POS based manufacturing and research no longer works. You need to use a citadel (preferably an engineering complex) to do it now.
---
Oooooooh so that's it. Thank you kind sir.
---
I was already sleep deprived from last night where ya'll didn't show.
---
We've also confirmed that PanFam doesn't need to use supers as a crutch to prop up bad fleet comps and feeding.
---
Because jammers
---
Thanks.
---
My first thought was the cpu, but it's more than capable of handling it. Its just whenever the window goes out of focus. Maybe there's a setting within my geforce control panel 🤔
---
I really shouldve looted that Naglfar.
---
@snuff
---
Server held up well and the 64 bit client proved itself nicely.
---
Props CCP.
---
ur mum ghey
---
It turns out that more people isn't always a superior doctrine.
---
lmao with your mum though
---
nah made 5 bill the other day from 6/10s in null its just bad luck man
---
really happy with the 64bc 
---
max graphics  /w 10%  TIDI even brackets , miles better than anything else before.
---
64-bit was amazing. 0 crashes, only turned down shaders, kept sound and everything else at max. I am super happy about the new client.
---
Fun fight. Glad it's over. Going to bed for a few hrs. Zzz.
---
Well in this case, they both are left. So who wins?
---
didnt you just runned like 30 mins ago?
---
This has crossed my mind, I live in Washington, home to Funko. With the style and detail in their The Star Wars, dragons, and other detailed figure lead me to believe that something is possible there. 
---
Funko+eve ships=win
---
May be I will give a try for this, great idea which can save tons of isk :)
---
This, jammers and didn't want to burn through 150km of bubbles I expect.
---
didnt you just not showed the last 72h?
---
Awesome,  how bad is the disruption so far?   And wonder what they will hit next, they only step up I can think of is JITA itself.
---
Best performance I have ever had out of my client in a fight like that.  I was at full graphics, no audio, no chat logging and was pulling 60fps all the way through.
---
My client would typically be in potato, and would get 10 - 15 fps in a fight like that.
---
Is it really possible that most of the client issues over the last few years have just been memory utilization?
---
I had 2 clients on grid and was still running smoothly on both. Seems like they actually may have done it.
---
You could always leave the biggest coalition in the game and get more small scale fights. ;)
---
Yeah we ran away from that trillion + we farmed from you! Just wasn’t a challenge
---
I drive nights from Edmonton and Calgary and back. Yesterday morning on the way back to Edmonton the smoke wasn't quite in red deer yet, just ahead in the distance was just a wall of haze, like driving through a curtain. I see we look forward to another summer like this....
---
Same, I think the issues with the client all this time have just been memory problems
---
which is fucking nuts
---
mg crystal without omega + some 3% implants, but thats up to your taste
---
I held a constant 50fps, full graphics, no chat logging or audio.
---
I can't believe how well this thing worked.
---
not sure if you heard, but income is split by goons, test, and horde.
---
What was her favorite ship? I'd say we all show up in her favorite ship.
---
For anyone reading this and misconstruing, ISD members of ECAID are not permitted to use the cockroach outside of test environments. It was CCP Dren that lost one https://zkillboard.com/kill/22231822/ and it’s a QA ship.
---
Tentative BR(still loading): https://br.inyour.space/?s=871&amp;b=8631600&amp;e=221&amp;t=bHvfaabi
---
well, they're still the best boost ship in large fleets. they used to have a niche in wormholes because of their extremely high EHP and relatively low mass, but this right now is the age of the drekavac so not sure if CS are still a thing.
---
why bother for non important timers... but yeah this is a fair claim
---
They are still worth it imo, good for both solo and small gang.
---
Use http://koahi.co/eve instead (from the sidebar)
---
I think we just waterboarded the battleships.
---
Would be cool to get two folks with the same system specs, same settings to run it with 1 in 32 bit and 1 in 64... would be hard to coordinate though.
---
"fight back" by killing structures.
---
what a nullsec thing to do
---
maybe if INIT and Test brought real doctrines
---
Cyno jammers are a thing?
---
This isn’t aging well
---
Thanks, I’ll have to check that ship type out a bit. I’m going to assume the support skills from CS transfer well over into the precursor ship type I’d need to train to use it or does it require an entirely different set of skills?
---
COrrect, I was asking about the supers though
---
I honestly cannot tell what is better, your editing skills or your piloting skills. 10/10 would fap again.
---
I know People hate the tool, but [br.inyour.space](https://br.inyour.space) is nowhere near accurate at this hour, try this instead: [https://fleetcom.space/battlereport/FQQ3gynBss7XyGEQ9](https://fleetcom.space/battlereport/FQQ3gynBss7XyGEQ9)
---
you seem pretty upset at goons dude
---
Honor to FC with you. Glad your competent ass left le'goon
---
1. Gate them in from next door? We were fighting on the gate...
---
2. 1000 man fleet can't blap some cyno jammers?
---
3. Cyno in outside cyno jammer range
---
God this is some smooth brain shit
---
Actually I’ve seen them in the same room, but they were wearing these weird metal bodysuits and a cat was furiously waving joysticks around in sync with their movements
---
You can tell that OPs game knowledge is ... limited from a number of lines, the boosh thingy is definitely not the worst.
---
[https://fleetcom.space/battlereport/FQQ3gynBss7XyGEQ9](https://fleetcom.space/battlereport/FQQ3gynBss7XyGEQ9) switch the dark theme, I know you hate it but at least it gives an accurate picture of the carnage.
---
Also SH1 IHUB saved :unsmith:
---
I'm not crying! You're crying!
---
Triglavians vs the combined forces of panfam, legacy, and imperium would not be a fair fight. They're probably smart enough to not contest the armor timer even if they do reinforce it.
---
"We" thats a funny way of saying Penifsmash
---
Sure, with the gates properly bubbled they would probably have arrived in about 2 days.
---
The quality of current 3D printing still comes nowhere near conventional cast models from 30 years ago though. Especially when you paint them with the usual wash/drybrush routines that highlight all irregularities in a model.
---
Well, who's fault is that?
---
Reply to the original ticket. I did with mine and they apologised and gave me a week of omega. It is about being polite.
---
Was fun, can't wait for the next one.
---
It's neither the foothold nor a system adjacent to it, so I wouldn't get too excited about the level of disruption in it. Prolly nothing will change really.
---
Yeah, supers came in at the end to clean up so we weren't there all night
---
It looks like goons are mad at him and he is mad at goons. Hopefully this leads to some good battles ingame.
---
very good fight mates
---
I was there....  Can I say this now????  I've been waiting to say it every since I seen that Eve trailer
---
...ok?! quick! everybody wardec test!
---
My fleet doesn't boot nocti, but if you're a cunt and become a loot black hole I might.
---
Well played Redline. Well Played. Glad you're playing with the good guys now.
---
Imagine having one of your most active Strat FCs leave your alliance only to join the other team and then proceed to dunk on you less than three weeks later. Welcome to the team Redline XIII!
---
I love you Elo
---
glorious
---
I came across one last night. Battleship spawns and loot is the same.
---
Oh I remember you fcing for goons
---
why you so salty lol gf
---
you guys fed a boatload of capitals to harpies, so uh suuuuure
---
Sansha managed to burn 2 ships, others sites where locked out by Triglavians in separate pockets of space.
---
Dude a lot of the OG/SA guys left and now its some cringey roleplayer in charge. Of course the mentality shifted to what it is now.
---
I have strange sense that some big fight happened while i was asleep.
---
[deleted]
---
Eh it was pretty fun to just go out and fight. Glad you are having fun Redline but gotten a little less pleasant than you used to be. See you in more fights later dude!
---
not from today but from a sotiyo reinforcement the other day
---
[06:45:48] Redline XIII &gt; guys you get the pings, you know im not FC, kill yourself ingame TIA
---
i think he's mad
---
Hi,
---
Does anyone know, why I can enjoy massive battles with maxed details without single hardware lag, if I have my sound turned off? If I have maxed details and sound turned on, eve client lags as hell.

Not a fan of 3D printed plastic models. They always feel cheep compared to an extruded plastic, like they had on the models they sold four years ago on fanfest... It´s more expensive though
---
Goons semms to feed Megas more on the 64bit Client, Thank CCP!
---
Thanks for the info.
---
This is the best AAR of them all.
---
Congrats, I think you did a great job and we had all the advantages, you guys didn't have any at all. Well done with your FCing. I was the lead FC for this fight and you definitely outclassed me. Congrats again.
---
I have strange feeling that some big fight happened while i was asleep
---
That may be, but they are really high quality. I have the Prophecy model of them, and it surely was worth the 120 Euros it did cost.
---
olmeca,  
---
Me and my boys (the B-Team (thatguytoxic and xtrasquishy)) go out every day and we have a blast. I wouldn't trade anything for it. we have fun inspite of CCP and continue to make life for carebears and nullbears dangerous. We're not the best, but we don't see that as a reason not to try.   
---
I watch your video and never have I seen any good wrap up of most of the feelings of the B-team. This game is the safest it's ever been. It feels like in this day and age, players in null don't understand why small/micro gangs exist because the play style is actively being pushed out.  
---
If it's not efficient, it's not the "proper way".... We have fun, and if you're not having fun you're not playing eve.  
---
this video almost brought me to tears,  
---
please never stop fighting, you're a legend my "dude",  
---
on behalf of the b-team  
---
thank you.
---
your FC's atacked because they knew we had deployed onto the other side of the map. as soon as we got back, you all ran mid RF'in shit and we grabbed a few of ya, but you still ran like pussies it was hilarious
---
Im not disputing his madness, im encouraging it cause grudge matches lead to great battles and wars.
---
Perfect for me to! Im extremely happy this is a thing. Everything runs pretty smooth.
---
As they were talking about 3d printed models, unlikely. Also, Kisaki models are very expensive. I got the Prophecy model and it did cost 120 Euros. If CCP now wants to put some more on it to earn something with those models, it would become even more expensive, and then there would barely be any interest in those models...  
---
But maybe they can talk with Eaglemoss? Their higher quality models are still a mix of decent quality and reasonable prizes
---
Eve helped me get through som tough times. I'm no logi pilot but I'll have your back as best I can.
---
i'll give you that one yeah
---
Was a great fight.
---
I just cant appreciate all the cries about going to bed with only a few hours sleep.
---
i was slightly late for work today, im at work now, literally dropped my super, blapped some goons and jumped out, left for work xD
---
and i was up on the long ass fleet last night scaring Test away from thier own shit
---
IKR? We lost more people to IRL than we did to Goons tonight.
---
Yeah, I think this is what he meant. Nobody tends to mine in the belts in nullsec any more because the anomolies are just better, and the anomolies provide everything in essentially unlimited abundance.
---
I know. They're a lovely couple, they make each other *very* happy.
---
Biomassed my first character after 1.5 months of training cause i got a bounty placed on it.
---
My Phrophecy model on my office desk sais otherwise  
---

---
killing themselves in game saves me the trouble tho
---
Glad everyone had a good time. u/redline_XIII don't forget to smash that subscribe button bruh.
---
I have no idea wtf you're talking about because you had timers next door to SH1 and didn't show. Then you show up late for SH1 and feed an entire baltec fleet.
---
Step it up. I expect better.
---
It appears even NPCs aren't immune to super proliferation.
---
did you plan this for 10 hours too?
---
Can you cite this? I'll be happy to amend the article if you have a more recent recording where Goons are instructed to report Imperium botters. I linked to the recording of Mittani telling a guy not to report fellow Goons but if that's not active policy, I'd like to be accurate.
---
from your comment it looked like you were a goon complaining we panfam, didnt show, when we didnt show last night due to being in deklien
---
Longer I'd wager. Just got outplanned.
---
Oh lol. no I'm nc.
---
You still sound very mad-salty.
---
Perhaps take a chill pill, yes you won this battle... jeez imagine if you lose. What then. 
---
Salt levels are to damn high for a win.
---
Super smooth  battle gf all around!
---
Redline couldn't play well with others. As a result, he didn't get the power and keys that he so desperately wanted. He then, as any 2 year old would, picked up his toys, got on his trainer wheel huffy and rode to another friends house. Pout pout.
---
Not winning fast enough eh?
---
I think I was in the same fleet as you, by the sound of it.
---
I'd like to add that we lost more people to IRL than we did to Goons. Still, at least they showed up which is praiseworthy in and of itself.
---
I just wanna go to bed.
---
looking at the BR i cant work out where we lost all that isk?
---
once again it was like the goons just sat there getting hit, waiting for something to happen.
---
but i guess they were killing something, Solomon, wasn't NC. though!
---
Why can't everyone just get along and mine in peace :(
---
i did find it funny, when just after we shred a chunk of megas while they jumped through the gate into our gatecamp (and all they did is align out and blap the bubbles)
---
thier bomber wing warped to the gate, right next to all of us and decloaked on us. made me chuckle
---
INB4 "already replaced", "PanFam is too scared to deploy supers", and/or "PanFam just blueball and never take fights" *somehow*.
---
Triglavian standings when CCPLS
---
&gt;We waterboard their caps on the way in and they end up jumping their full Baltec and Eagle fleet into our super Eagle fleet (probably definitely outnumbered Goons according to them, lol).
---
I was flying a Jackdaw in that Eagle fleet. Not only did the Goons outnumber us by a decent margin but they also brought (and continued to feed) Megathrons.
---
Gudfites all around.
---
I don't really blame him. The shit being heaped on him lately by the 'A-team' FCs has been a bit over the top
---
thats whats important right
---
If every time you shared a system with people you thought were your friends and they ended up just shitting on you because you left their space guild you'd be a little less pleasant too.
---
perhaps there's a list of systems it can spawn in based on specific parameters? at least for now...
---
Apparently new player systems also got invaded lol
---
Aaaaaand given that this entire fleet was a coordinated effort of four different fleets working on separate targets and systematically removing threats to each fleet in tandem.. POOF! There goes your narrative.
---
X if elite
---
i mean, i agree, i would buy it. But from a marketing view, its not that smart. Eve isn't warhammer
---
How dare people shoot defenseless mining ships! Miner lives matter, if it wasnt for the miners and indy players, there would be nobody to make the ships for PvP!
---
Nah the lad deserves a victory lap. He was treated like shit by the Goon FC team just because he wanted to create good content for you guys but got shat on by the man.
---
This is his redemption let him enjoy it and take your medicine. No one doubts this is the end of the war, and western Tribute is all but gone already.
---
I'm confused, what does this have to do with you being a drooling baby and taking your toys somewhere else?
---
Micro means very small.  The cost of 1 single plex is small but no one buys just 1.  If they buy plex they make a macro transaction of 500.  When most people say micro transactions they are referring to $.99 to $1.99 (small)
---
i mean, goons RF shit while we arnt there or doing something else, then post memes about undocking and NCDocked. WHILST WE CHASE THEM.
---
they shit talk non stop, until their battleship fleets get pwned YET AGAIN (funny how the shittalking stops while they struggle to survive, then after 1 hour cry to be primaried cos they dont want to be there any longer)
---
they somehow think burning some useless pointless structures is them winning.
---
maybe eventually theyll work out how to get the job done, i guess until then its a bit of practice for goon leadership military skills, this aint no mining op
---
all the smack talk aside... gf to everyone that showed up to this fun fight. Hope we have many more big brawls like this.
---
Yes. Happy belated Mother's Day.
---
It will only mess with autopilots, gankers, and non-tanked haulers tbh. The trip to Jita has never felt safer that it does now... which is a problem because I'm running an anti-gank fit to troll tornado squads. &gt;.&gt; Dammit invasions are ruining my fun.
---
Fun-fact: The Loki has a higher mass than the damnation.
---
I'm glad you found undock button! :) As long as you won't forget where it is everyone in GSF will be happy even when BR shows 2:1. GF!
---
Probably the part where you said he couldn't play well with others?
---
Let's not consider the honeymoon phase of trying to please a new alliance while seeking petty revenge on your old boyfriend "playing well with others". You'll see soon enough.
---
Wow I got called out you really do care redline &lt;3
---
I mean,  to be a goon you basically have to accept conflicting narratives
---
The Triglav ships use new racial skills under "Precursor [Frigate/Cruiser/Etc]" and their weapons under a similar classification. The support skills such as the Magic 14 and armour skills especially are beneficial to have. The precursor weapon system (Disintegrators) are pretty cpu/pwg intensive so fitting skills are also very much recommended.  
---
The disintegrators make use of the regular turret support skills like surgical strike etc. 
---
Essentially outside of the racial ship and disintegrator-specific skills the support skills that are useful on any armour-tanked turret platform are useful on these ships.
---
That was not even a delve tic loss those ships are already replaced we will see u on the battlefield with your loss of rental income and no ratting mining good luck replacing your ships
---
TFF Red, was good fun even if it was at 5am-8:30am my time xD
---
Sorry about that :)
---
i want friends :(
---
Daredevil?
---
Man, they really buffed the armour on that thing...
---
It was my first fight flying with bees. I'm not great at pvp.
---
I got killmails, so I'm happy, no matter the result.
---
gf, i had fun as the server chugged along, and made my rapid light reload time take a century.
---
How did you get the model? I can't find any website or store..
---
That's more than likely software (client) side. 
---
And the reason it's so advisable to disable sounds during big fights. 
---
Btw, are you referring to the 64-bit client?
---
So basically the only way NC can win is by luring GOON FCs to lead them?
---
That's some elite shit right there!
---
The Mittani is again implementing the Fabian Strategy to wear us down with numerous dunks. I don't know about you, but I'm nearly worn out from all the winning.
---
No matter whether we win or lose the war, we will have won. The newbeans that joined between wars get to taste the skirmishes and battles, and they're more determined than ever to grow up like all of us have.
---
I can't speak for NC., and PL, because I'm a Hordeling (now and forever!). But every time we get to fight, and every time we get blue-balled, and every time we have to blue-ball the morale sits pretty balanced. You see, we've been practicing endlessly since WWB. We've been experiencing the wins, and the losses, and hardening ourselves for the next big thing all while some other alliances were "rebuilding" (read: being gluttonous). Their morale is no better than the surface tension of water. It can look hard as crystal when it's still, but a simple poke disturbs it. It has to be at rest to maintain its illusion.
---
I am thankful that our leadership aren't some distant kings, in a distant land barking shallow platitudes to stir up aqueous morale. Gobbins doesn't make grandiose, yet vapid speeches about redemption, retribution, and proving some greater point.
---
No. Gobbins, and all of the leadership maintains one simple precept
---
&gt;We're a PvP alliance. When there are fights to be had, we fight.
---
Fin.
---
I never fly logi cos I'm a selfish asshole but ill be bringing logi. o7
---
I'll always love you and my desire to meme on you comes from love.
---
Slither on!
---
Nice as always Blights! Please turn on weapon notifications in space though, you will have a much easier time.
---
I dont know why but the new undock button has been really difficult for me to find. Probably muscle memory.
---
At Fanfest 2015 (I think) they did sell two Prophecy models, and two different Stratios models (classic and blue if I´m not mistaken). It was also the first Fanfest I went to and assumed they always sell those models there, and planned to get one every year. If I would have known it was only that one year I would also have bought the Stratios as well...
---
Supers/Tits didn't really do anything until the very end and just cleaned up. I was waiting in the Titan so long that I just switched the alt to another eagle for more pewpew.
---
This hurt me to read
---
It's about a third of a chrome tab... xD
---
Mandatory good poasting\~

You mean by the guys that brought 150 feroxes to save your period basis sov Vs a 50 man muninn fleet, then playing probe games with us and only killing a single lach and muninn while losing the timer? Obviously we really ran away lol, we had much fun killing hundreds of billions up there whole you guys were moving your fleets lol (also funny to see how your cap FCs are scared to get a full fleet of faxes and supers through a regional because we have 80 gokus there, then bringing 200 harpies or how you form 200 eagles and feroxes to counter 60 eagles bashing your astra or how you lose jump freighters jumping to beacons or ... Should I continue? We didn't run away from you, we came back to the place where more content is because we farmed your krabs too much ^^)
---
 What makes you think I would leave one alliance where I had to wear pink lipstick just to go to another one that makes me wear purple?
---
Yeah but they knew the gates would be bubbled. They midded supes despite knowing the gates were bubble fucked.
---
Oh I see.  Hope they can manage to set up the damn store with some models.
---
I'm elite, sweetie.
---
But goons had so many supers and titans, if they just jumped into the fight they would have definitely stomped the northern resistance at the source.  maybe their main FC's were sleeping.
---
Great AAR. Thanks
---
Test fleet was not deleted, legions got a good chunk but we regrouped and got two dreads and few legions that tried to smartbomb us again but failed.
---
After reading this, I don't think I would be able to shoot at you
---
thanks. well, i don't upload as frequently as other eve youtubers, but you can watch my older videos, although they are less joky and more of a traditional pvp-video kind
---
Sure next one in Niarja :D
---
Lat night while infleet bashing a For and being attacked, all our EU members DC's.    They were able to relog but annoying as sin and could of lost us the timer.
---
&gt; Triglavians vs the combined forces of panfam, legacy, and imperium would not be a fair fight.
---
you're right. triglavians actually undock
---
I thought NC stayed out of it when PH went for GOTG?
---
If so, why beat on their sov, go fight in Geminate
---
imagine being a random worthless linemember thinking you're elite because your leadership says they have a great economy.
---
Remember when a war started after PGL called Sort Dragon's girlfriend fat?
---
isnt it so that incursions dont affect starter systems?
---
Plex is no different to gems or other currency type systems other games use
---
*oh no*
---
A L R E A D Y R E P L A C E D
---
Anyone tried it through Isboxer ?  I have a simple septup using it and not a power user of isboxer so don't know how easy it would be to enable the 64bit client ?
---
Its a marathon not a sprint
---
That was a fun fight, GF Goons and Co. As for the Panfam and friends all I can say is great teamwork. Awesome job FC team and all the brave dictor pilots who lost their lives in the line of duty. Looking forward to more fun fights. o7
---
Great fight! It was a lot of fun.  We should of kicked Redline years ago if he makes NC undock
---
Take down the cyno jammers and I'm sure we'll gladly jump them in.  Until then, we can't really do that can we?
---
thats a lot of words and a lot of spin to make up for the lack of facts stated there bud
---
Redline is in NC and salty at goons? Heh. JA Makanen much?   
---
I still remember how salty you were at him for leaving and now you do the same?   
---
Why? Why so salty man? You were cool and chill in goons, what happened?
---
You want me to find brs for that?
---
He doesn’t want fights he wants helldunks
---
 *There* does not equal *they're*
---
This tbh. And because of this Horde has unironically become one of the most competent and battle hardned alliances in the game. It's absolutely awesome.
---
I speak under correction here, but to my understanding:
---
The CPU processes instructions in 1's or 0's. Each of these is a bit, e.g. 1100 is 4 bits. With 32-bits no application can use more than 4GB of RAM. With 64-bit you can greatly exceed that, and the CPU can handle more complex instructions per cycle, you have more bits so you can fit more info into each instruction. Which makes things run faster. 
---
The increase is exponential, and not only 2x (32 to 64).
---
to be fair, i'd wager the majority of people in PL make their isk in ways other than ratting... I could be wrong though
---
t. cyno jammers
---
But I did the same thing in the last war:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/98kb04/today\_was\_a\_good\_day/e4gn767/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/98kb04/today_was_a_good_day/e4gn767/?context=3) :thunk:
---
Bob was the FC Redline just took over and did it quiet well. I guess it was my first fleet under this team but iam looking forward joining all USTZ ops i can even when this means a bit weired lifestyle sometimes as a german...
---
Know what was defenitely a delve tic worth of losses? The numerous supers, rorqs and titans we dunked these past weeks. I'm really excited for this months MER because it will show just how much we dickpunched your economy
---
Ya what an asshat, he didn't want to navigate the incompetent bureaucratic shitshow of your FC ladder
---
Remember when a retired swedish HVAC repairman was trolled so badly it collapsed his entire in-game image and lead to years of wars and fights?
---
You're doing bob's work bud. Love me a good grudge in EVE.
---
Floating NyX!!!
---
More like a dramiel
---
The same as in a switchback and backstab?
---
I still miss scarebear fleets.
---
Ive been there. In my maulus. Helped take down Naglfar and Revelation. Went much better than I expected-didnt crash, despite using 32bit client, didnt die in TIDI, didnt even die in transit to home.  Shame that I was too far from any wrecks, though.
---
What a snack
---
I imagine if ccp today told hilmar of yesterday back 8-10 years ago, that if they went to 64bit and sold it as Eve's only paid expansion, they would have made bank. Paid in cash or plex.
---
Don't you have those were you live? I seriously thought those were universal.
---
In Argentina we call them "medialunas".
---
And they look more like a Dramiel tbh.
---
i encourrage upvoting this, cause everyone will read this post you made there :D:D:D
---
and that the only thing people are talking about the fight is the client. Battle of 64-BIT.
---
He's just a care-bear! How could you?
---
F in the chat for the olden days, my dude.
---
F.
---
This school yard who has the bigger boy penis nonsense is making me dislike Null more and more every day. It's so juvenile.
---
No, the same as in FCing fleets, doing good shit, and bragging about it on reddit in the form of smug-filled AARs only to eat shit 2 weeks later and completely regret being so arrogant.
---
We have some projects ongoing to improve performance for Eve's audio, but it can be very processor-intensive in a huge fight.  For now, if you know you're going to be doing something that will stress the client, I'd recommend turning audio off while doing so.
---
admit it, purple is just much more your color.
---
I fixed that, thanks. I should've been to sleep hours ago.
---
Dunno bud, been PVPing for a decade and it's still fun.
---
Does anyone honestly care? The botters don't, its just a cost of doing business for them. Ban them and be done with it.
---
After I died, I realized that I couldn't go home empty handed.  I approached a dread wreck from 18km away, through the middle of Panfam's super fleet, while sig tanking Eagles who thought my pod looked like an easy target.  I found a Sabre in the wreck, boarded it and tried to get the fuck out.  
---
Meanwhile, my hands were shaking so hard I couldn't click on the right menu options and my adrenaline was so high, it was an experience I haven't had in easily 10 years from solely playing EVE.
---
Special thanks to Ralg of Shiva in Northern Coalition for keeping a Sabre around for me to reship into!
---
Can you share a fit please?
---
"Should have I stayed a little longer in high sec before moving to null sec to learn more about the mechanics of this game and all that? Probably."
---
No, you did the right thing. Be Brave.
---
precursor hulls and weapons have their specific skills, but ofc boost skills and general skills still apply.
---
Here's my reasons:
---
1. I am still playing because once in a blue moon, you get those amazing solo fights where 20 t1 frigs attack your triple rep prophecy
---
2.  Because after tons of solo kills, you still get a rush out of even killing a noobship. 
---
3. The politics and every alliances 'spin' on current events on reddit is really funny, and the shitposts are great.
---
4. There's many ways to play this game, you can choose to do semi AFK stuff or for it to be interactive, which is useful if you are studying further on top of a full time job. 
---
5. I don't know how to quit permanently.
---
Luckily for you we can drop some links in local now that can help you find it.
---
TIL, pretty weird tho.
---
Lol imagine being this dumb.
---
Times change. Hope you are enjoying pastures new.
---
elongated knight best knight tbh
---
Nice AAR
---
Also great form up from Slyce as always Rick, 8 dudes on the BR for a 2000 man Alliance
---
Dont forget to pay your renter fees to panfam this month.
---
I love you, Brownie Bite.
---
I care. You seem upset.
---
Judging by your new ticker you will eat shit. Hey at least you’ll make the undock more often!   
---
Sadly I won eve terminally so I will only see this from reddit.
---
Pretty boring aar. Sounds more like a buthurt write-up then an actual aar.
---
when your ex gf AARs
---
&gt; There used to be fights and small scale wars everywhere
---
  Strange, I remember this reason being used during Dominion sov... It's almost like it's complete bullshit and sovnull has always been about the large alliances...
---
I'm upset people are appeased by this pittance rather than demanding CCP fix this rampant problem, yes.
---
Yeah but that means he needs to leave his safety net and risk *gasp* LOSING SHIPS
---
Dramiel
---
&gt;It will only mess with autopilots, gankers, and non-tanked haulers tbh.
---
&gt;Actually it also messes with me
---
&gt;Dammit CCP
---
:D
---
Didn't X though, so how can we be sure?
---
I care that **it is not done during a weekend** when more people can take a part in this.
---
This isnt an incursion, it's an invasion
---
You can actually run one account on 32 and another on 64 on the same computer. Just launch one, change the setting in the launcher, and launch the second. I actually did this by accident on release day.
---
There used to be more large alliances, more coalitions and coalitions used to be smaller
---
We have had bad times before, goons had one half and ncpl had the other, this is when ccp fucks up force projection
---
Then it was supers, now its jumpgates and citadels
---
What time did this actually go down??? I didn't see shit before I went to bed.
---
No worries at all, any excuse to link that killmail :D
---
Better question, why is the state the only one that doesn't use it standard logo but instead uses the militias?
---
Of course. Else jita would also be under the invasion and this post would be about jita.
---
Rote's not bad either bro, sometimes. ;)
---
So, pretty much the early days of the previous northern war.
---
Hahaha
---
These invasions literally last 2 days. Who cares.
---
It's hard to get *small scale fights* without getting helldunked.  It's too easy for large blocs to travel.
---
Now if only Triglavians would stop concord from responding.
---
tfw redline, a decent dude, joins nc and starts cringe posting
---
Appeased? Every other post here and on EVE-O forums are complaints about botting. These little shows they put on - despite being very entertaining - aren't making people ignore the bot problem.
---
to be fair, its weekend for AUTZ :)
---
I was sad that I missed this, but after reading this, I'm not too disappointed. Maybe next time. :)
---
Didn't they say that a new player blowing up means they have a much bigger chance of continuing to play the game?
---
Fuck them for doing it during their work hours right
---
What channels am I supposed to be subscribed to on jabber to see these 24 hour hurfs? Redline's spy alt is obviously more connected than I am it seems.
---
Bet you wouldn't say that in autz
---
\*Respiration lourde\*
---
Yeah but no one cares about au tz ;)
---
Could they have been out of range? Drones don't auto-attack anything that's beyond your drone control range.
---
just watch quebber cooking Lobby on twitch.... absolutly love the man already and ive never met him b4 today
---
Man I 100% feel ya. I submitter a ticket about compromised account about a month ago and still waiting.
---
Worst thing is that they dont even write anything like "ok we see this and working"
---
Default key is F.
---
&gt;The tide has turned for the most part against the Imperium. 
---
I remember hearing this before in ROIR :P
---
In war, plans are useless but planning is essential.
---
Wait how can I get in on all this?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0h_q6P3lr4
---
I was there!
---
what are the chances peligro remembers to ban them this time?
---
No, I don't think it is possible for rogues to lock on beyond 20km.
---
Man, some people are never satisfied.
---
PanFam could kill every Rorq in Delve with a 100-man Stuka fleet and your ass would still be saying they're not good enough.
---
Any explosion is a good explosion.
---
Yeah, but I'm more planning on mining and doing something else than clicking F. Also, what exactly does F do?
---
Anyone is welcome in any ship, this is all an amazing response.
---
You can either have people fighting over structures or 30 citadels in every system and no cares to do anything about them.
---
This should be so much fun.
---
Neutral reps all day long.
---
How ever i find it very hard to believe that PL / NC would unlock anything bigger then a shuttle.
---
Everyone is welcome.
---
Really?
---
Man, as though those two weren't big enough losers as-is.
---
&gt; There used to be more large alliances, more coalitions and coalitions used to be smaller
---
  Show me on the sov map when this happened.
---
Then look into machs.  They are the fastest lvl 4 blitzers.
---
Yes, your internet spaceship life is so above this class of people....
---
I will only siege if I go down too fast, but maybe not I mean Big explosions is big explosions! Paola would have loved it if we get dropped by certain people.
---
Was a good fight... should do it again... and again... and again... and again...
---
I got on at 9:45 and the fight wasn't over until 12:30. Almost three hours, and I enjoyed every second.
---
I've been away for 4 years what exactly is a fax.
---
And it was glorious.
---
I mean, pretty much everyone got it.  Just nobody wanted it.
---
Lmao that’s hilarious, he was just wondering what ever happened to it! I’ll make sure he knows it found a new home heh
---
Thank you for that, it was wonderful.
---
Eventhought it s to put a knife in gotg back after the 2018 war.
---
Yeah PH took fight it s good ;=) You were really the best of the north in the 2018 war. But you had, you have and you will still have a lot of blueballs too.
---
Not lying Paola would be laughing if that happened :)
---
&gt;your alliance is fighting several large and powerful alliances and your time is near.
---
god damn, i fucking wish.
---
Things that make a big boom!
---
Possibly number of killmails generated? Newbie systems get their suicide missions (plus newbies just being new), and trade hubs and courier routes have your gankathons, so they'll both be higher on your list than some backwater high sec system that never sees action.
---
That's great! :D
---
Look forward to seeing you.
---
Damn. What tz? Even if it was mine, I would have passed out before it got that late, I think.. waking up at 5 blows.
---
Wew lad
---
Do you have your drone settings set to "aggresive"?
---
Huh. Two hours before "muh delve time" spergposting.
---
This must be your off timezone.
---
Your correct :) still fun to fly thought.
---
Just a battle AAR not war AAR though. 
---
The war AAR will likely go like this: With the amount of hardware that Goons brought to the North, they have burned down Tribute as expected. With destruction on both sides, the true winner of them all surfaced: the miners.
---
We all cry together when a pilot is lost, a part of us is gone, a place inside is hollow, one step and remember the  good times.
---
Imagine being a linemember and thinking you're elite because of the alliance you're a linemember of.
---
(Not countering you, btw, just adding to your point.)
---
In EVE as in life we should always expect the unexpected.
---
Hell yeh man nice one i hope it treats you well in space friend.
---
0/10
---
Let's be honest, though, while he's not entirely right you aren't really either. Yeah, we put a dent in their economy but it's far from crippling.
---
Good advice for Goons tbh.
---
Ok will do :)
---
You can't do that yourself?
---
It's a shitty and abandoned type of PVE, they should just delete it.
---
But I doubt they will, CCP probably just fucked up and will turn it on back again soon™.
---
i dont know man i am weird like it that way.
---
If CCP want to show us something useful, what about the dates when the player base 1st reported these bots to them.
---
The kills aren't but the not using shinies to krab anymore is
---
I saw a post about this one of the last times they did it, and it's what got me playing to begin with!
---
It orders the drones to engage your target. So mining drones will nom the rock you're looking at (if you get to them), and combat drones will pew the enemy you have selected.
---
Useful when their durr-AI has them sit and spin like you describe.
---
We never undock or jump in with anything we can't afford to lose or accept losing, roll the dice and make it glorious.
---
So then give me a context where you can call someone the n-word and it shouldn't be considered racist? Because I'm not really seeing a context where it's not? I understand your point about society giving words power, but that doesn't make a racist term any less racist to say?
---
lol why so salty, aren't you swimming in Deklein bot isk atm?
---
Ok
---
calling CCP to this thread...
---
CAN YOU TEMPORARILY DISABLE DIMINISHING RETURNS ON REPS for this please
---
The horrible stain on my KB that is loosing a gila in a T3 abyssal because i focused the wrong enemies
---
X
---
Definitely give Bomber's Bar a shot. Grab a bomber, get covops ops cloakiness, strap torps down. X up and pew :)
---
I care :'(
---
The thing about the shit-talk is that now Goons have to eat some crow.
---
Roman gladiators would talk up the ability of their opponents before a fight. If they lost they lost no honour for being defeated by such a strong opponent, and if they won they won much honour for defeating such a capable foe.
---
Goons endlessly sperging about how inferior they think PanFam is just means that when they lose shit it's doubly humiliating.
---
I can fly one we could see if I could get there and back.

---
Meh, I'm not convinced that Goons are avoiding Rorq deployment in the quantity required to damage their economy to the point where economic warfare becomes viable.
---
If they're smart they'll keep some assets in reserve to cover Delve and restrict Rorq mining to within range of supers.
---
Oh I'm sorry, are we annoying you?
---
The statistic in question claimed new players who blew up in pvp in their first week had a much bigger chance to continue playing, but it's a nonsense and skewed statistic since new players jumping straight into pvp that quickly probably either had or quickly found a support structure/friends or were just alts to start with.
---
V nice video :thumbsup:
---
That probably wouldn't end well, her favourite ship was a Vigil.
---
She loved target painting expensive enemy ships while orbiting the FC.
---
&gt;Filling a JF cargohold with Noxcium
---
... is not smart - instead use compressed crokite
---
around 45000 blocks fit in a JF, giving you more then 25M Nox, 700+ M Tritanium and 4.5M Zydrine in a bad equippid refining station.
---
9/11
---
Great story!
---
I reported blue ambrye and the corp the WERMT hel was in about 10 months ago.
---
Your talking point doesn't make sense. The optimal strategy is to hit the enemy where they're weak, not where they're strong. Surely if you're making gains in Delve the focus of your offensive forces would be...Delve.
---
It's the same TZ as China....
---
Yes but that's not important. What's important is the war, which you're rapidly losing.
---
Do it anyways. If nothing else it'll be some pretty pictures to look at.
---
Have you heard about our Lord and Savoir A Seadoo or known as Seddow
---
I’ve never hear
---
Kashin bus is an inner hell alt, ex gotg renter.
---
It's something that they're actually iterating on 😁
---
you could start a new account/character and go through the tutorial + career missions, they're very handy. here's a copy-pasta for new players:
---
Make sure to be buddy-invited by someone if you decide to start playing. It is a very significant bonus (750k SP) you get for doing so.
---
The [#newbie-help channel on the Discord server](https://discord.gg/Pjac38Y) is also filled with people who want to help out. 
---
&gt; General way to approach EVE as a new player, but yours may differ completely: Ingame tutorial -&gt; career agents (all if they interest you, see the Eve Uni link below) -&gt; thealphasguide -&gt; SoE Arc -&gt; maybe some exploration for ISK (see pinned message on exploration guides) -&gt; ??? -&gt; try PvP (maybe with Spectre Fleet) -&gt; look into joining a corp/alliance (see pinned message about newbie corps) -&gt; ??? (see the picture on what to do below) -&gt; enjoy!

Global tell all the bot rorquals to drop corp we don‘t want to give them an easy win in the pie chart of shame because if fucking bot rorquals.
---
Yes.  Yes it is.
---
It's almost like people have real loves and jobs and shit.
---
Besides WH-, the biggest thing I remember from the last 72h is another fleet out of SH- where Goons just didn't show.
---
EST, so that shit ended at 3am lmao.
---
Join Horde. I think that's the name of the in-game channel, otherwise just look up Pandemic Horde Inc. in-game and check the desc.
---
Go join Horde they’ll help you and answer your questions... or brave I guess
---
isn't it amazing what making a bigger, more obvious undock button can do?
---
They're not WRONG, but its more like they'd just be blue to the coalition next to them instead of just directly controlling it themselves
---
It's a fucking computer game. None of this matters.
---
'North'
---
I lost an expensive ship while exploring; it made me quit the game in 2017... Now i just logged on, got myself a cheap-ish heron and tried exploring again, went in the first wormhole i saw and checked if there's anything there but while scanning i got blasted by 2 others and lost my ship again.
---
Is exploring always like this? No way to gain money without risking it all?
---
TIL SkillU is the north
---
I didn't know the east is the north
---
I know, I'm not the creator or affiliated to it, I just like that it loads instantly.
---
I mean, what's important to me is annoying you enough to get ALL THIS SALT.
---
Op success.
---
You're either new or the 1%.  Eve is full of people who don't think they should be disturbed unless they want to be.
---
I mean, if you genuinely don't have anything else in your life to be proud of then go ahead.
---
When in  test everything is north./
---
I kept pushing for CCP to have the mechanism so that the war dec HQ or whatever it is is within the stated TZ of the defender.   I will keep pushing it.
---
Their fights might not be (then it's eve, no such thing).
---
Their cause is.
---
Wait, so you think CCP did this so people are appeased and don't demand they fix anything? In what way does this interfere with people demanding the problem gets fixed? Why can't we have both?
---
Exactly this.    I am glad other people are getting to this, I did try.
---
I too am gay. 
---
X up if you're gay.
---
&gt;The AUTZ merc corp is still not going to get a fight
---
I think the entire war system would need a vast redesign for it to actually lead to fights. Most wardecs are just sealclubbing, they never lead to fights (maybe ganks though).
---
At least having an objective and a structure to fight as opposed to a station to camp is a big improvement.
---
Hah Gayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
---
I can remember that i still saw the sites in space on tuesday. Maybe its just not in the agency.
---
But why *buy* a dildo when you can *3d print an avatar or an epithal*?
---
I wish frat would really fight us. 
---
Fyi: we love this shit and wouldnt stop even if we were told to
---
so, goons win? :D
---
And he would have gotten away with it, if it was not for them pesky kids.
---
There were a few orcas too as appetizers.
---
I think the triglavian invasion will go beyond the scouting phase over time since CCP said that they will get more and more hefty the longer the invasion goes on.
---
I’d say about 3/10 on shitpost quality
---
What does that have to do with anything?
---
You wouldn't say this in AUTZ
---
CCP buffed NC. reeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Woops, I didn't know that about the MJD. TIL
---
You can be salty, I'm flying all up in this.
---
How did you get through that fight with these graphics...
---
Imagine calling your former friend hateful names just because he fucking doesn't play with your space guild anymore.
---
Jesus christ.
---
I’ve never heard someone be so happy to be being made money from lol
---
Did you deploy combat drones after they agro you? From my experience the drones only trigger to fight back if you get new agro once they are deployed. Be it one that was only yellow boxing now red boxing, or one that was already red boxing but then applies some ewar.
---
If the 2nd trigger happens or you manually tell them to attack something they will then auto carry on killing any that red boxed you.
---
Frat and it's allies wipe the floor with you every evening.
---
I know all that, I was making a joke at CCP dumbly following a statistical finding "if you get blown up as a new player, you've got more chances at continuing to play". So obviously, the best next move is to spawn the invasion in a new player system!
---
I had about 30 newbeans under me in ewar. That's up to 90 goon cruisers with their damage slashed. That was fun, managed to get on a lot of kills.
---
Yep, was a great time. These fights are the reason i still play.
---
So you droped some supers and they didnt counter?
---
Why didint they follow up?
---
sure, and make sure find the one where you guys fed a bomber fleet and feroxs to our ferox fleet before leaving us to bash your station down while you're at it.
---
looking at one BR i saw on another post.
---
goons 800man fleet (and unused 400man super fleet) achieved killing 6dreads?, whilst theyre entire operation and almost the whole fleet die
---
How about u let someone who was actually [involved](https://zkillboard.com/character/852152117/) in the battle do a proper AAR compared to this karma whore?
---
Does a dedicated sound card help?
---
CCP dont paid overtime to do these things, so they do it during their work hours
---
\*insert Charlie Murphy laugh\*
---
Who was that again?
---
No but I turn down effects on 5/6 clients
---
&gt;forcing the hibernating players in highsec out of highsec by throwing wrenches into their day to day play.
---
Alternatively, it is forcing people to stop playing the game as the playstyle they enjoy has, as you put it, wrenches thrown into it while other playstyles don't get any negatives.
---
While i'm happy CCP is putting development time into something that can involve people playing in highsec for once (a notable chunk of the population), it does seem like they have far too much focus on making things annoying or disruptive rather than "worthwhile things to do as you decide to." Far too often, it seems CCP just wants to punish highsec players rather than offer them... well, features in the game they're paying for.

Anyone tried it with Linux/proton yet?

Thought - CCP is spawning the invasions and seeing what happens to collect ~data~

I mean the activity tracker shows how they have improved data logging. I also know from RL work exp that making pretty charts is the best way to sell shit to your bosses.

We did have an advantage my dude,

we had r/Redline_XIII and you did not :D

we had competant pilots, and you did not

we won a fight, outnumbered again, and you did not

If you let them win and get brave they make mistakes.

When you have 20 skill injected rorq alts I guess isk doesn't mean much.

must admit it was hard to find the undock button since the last time we diddly dunked goons fleet last time.
---
new undock button for sure helps
---
CCP just trying to brush it under the rug and pretend it never existed?
---
Lol you’re getting desperate, feroxes..... yeah we ran away because well lost a few billion in ships

replace pirates with triglavians -&gt; bam, brandnew content bois.

I don't know whether or how much a dedicated sound card would help, but it's unlikely to be a night-and-day improvement to use one.

the /r/eve subreddit wasn't exactly where I expected to run into Sondre Lerche, but here we are. Cool video, nice shots!

Don't you fight horde? I saw your alliance several times on strat ops.

Sir, I respect your integrity.
---
try explaining your windows admin that can't use a command line to safe his life how to use irssi and you quickly realize why irc isn't more popular.
---
Other idea I had, that was a reply to a comment that got downvoted to oblivion.
---
Basic issue is CCP expected players to set TZs to their most active time, since thats when your one and have people to defend with. Instead people make the TZ the one where basically NO ONE is around since thats more effective.
---
You need what CCP wants and what pilote want to align. In this case setting timers to when they are actually active.
---
Perhaps making some sort of benefit or bonus to the citadel when its in its timer window?
---
I don't know what type of bonus, but something big enough to make people want it.
---
i mean, im a brit (GMT+0)

i docked yesturday at 11pm, asleep by 11:30pm

im in the office at work trolling goons on reddit since 9am

all up for round 2, 3, 4 and 5 over this weekend. F goons

Obviously, hence why you went to all the effort of posting about it a dozen times.
---
Slow down, bucko. At least buy me dinner first.
---
Block zombie here, would def. vote for Olmeca if I wasn't. That video is inspiring.
---
Eh? Wtf are you on about?

fear and cowardice
---
Thanks, Wulkans.
---
Were you running the 64-bit client?
---
Graphics look smooth and not laggy or anything. :)
---
Slowly it becomes super clear where George Lucas had the ideas from for Star Wars fights in space :D
---
Lol fair enough, I got done reading Redliners (obvious Hedliner style cramping name) and he kinda ruined the whole atmosphere for all these AARs as seeming overly grr goon and that carried across into my reading of yours.
---
Everyone wins, your objective? Glassing Tribute, definitely achievable. Win. PanFam objective? Killing Delve and making some key plays during Tribute battle. Win. 
---
Let's all drink the Kool-Aid together and keep subbing.
---
64bit client =)
---
Exactly. Why bring up people's jobs when discussing what happens Inna fucking computer game?
---
J a was a prick and didnt want to learn hence the attitude he ended up recieving. Weird that
---
fwiw, I didn't switch client and tidi/lag aside, my client operated smoothly. so I'm not sure it had anything to do with the the new version
---
Big boi repping monster.
---
They are an absolute must for a fleet-bro from small to large fleets. Even just using a link on a non-command ship with/without bonuses is plenty worth it
---
 Especially if you have Skirmish/Info/Shield/Armor link implant plugged in. Their bonuses are simply ridiculous - for example Skirmish gives -16% sig radius, +32% AB/MWD speed, +40% propulsion disruption range on a Claymore.
---
So just been In Jita and tbh it was tidi hell.  Took ages to warp etc...wonder if CCP still need to reinforce nodes.
---
Top right in the launcher are the launcher options.
---
In the settings menu simply activate the 64bit option
---
Take a decent exploration guide on YouTube, grab a t1 explo frigate, fly ls for relic/data sites.
---
You won't make lot of isk, like really not, but you will get you hands back on Eve for cheap and will remember how this game is pvp oriented + a few other things (like dscan all the time).
---
Your GPU might simply be maxed out.
---
But if it isnt then try changing the "Interval Preset" in the graphics options of EVE
---
Are you high?
---
teleporting botters to jita allowing people to kill them but they drop loot so is that classed as people benefitting from botters?
---
[How I imagine this going down at CCP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeuOYUSXyi8)
---
I'll give that a try, thanks. The gpu isn't maxed, because the games don't stutter when the other one is in focus. I'll definitely try the interval though :)
---
Well tbh mine was a half assed attempt at a joke by implying miners = goons, but I do agree that shooting each other is good for the game.
---
Figure out what you want to do and look on Google &amp; YouTube.
---
I feel with you. My Ticket is also löst in somewhere IT seems. @CCP Your customers need Help #Wakeupdamnit
---
wouldn't it make sense to introduce a "potato mode for sound" setting where only sounds for your own ship and music are being considered, not any other sound sources? As a second step it could even be enabled automatically if sound calculations are getting too computationally expensive. Just a thought...
---
I always thought Redline was too nice to say something like this.  Apparently not.  It's still relatively polite I guess.
---
Oh shit that looks fucking nice. 
---
Gotta ask, I usually run 4-5 clients but struggle to run them on high settings(can only do 3) without chrome and everything else becomes unusable. I have 12gb ram, i5 4690k and a simple gtx 1050 ti. What do I need to upgrade to run eve better when multiboxing, and potentially run them all on high settings?
---
Hi Quebber, Mark Artreides here, the 2nd worst FC ever for EG. I am going to hook you two up to make sure it gets there or make sure it happens.  Currently at work, once home I will grab you on Discord.
---
We are pretty much assuming nobody krabs during deployment. Those who do are assumed to die quietly
---
damn, never thought of that one...
---
Thanks dick, you kinda broke my heart.
---
You must be talking about a different fc team. Red wasn’t shit on , he wanted to change how things worked, he’s got mad ego, and wanted to do it his own way (no insult intended, it’s a style that’s fits some places and not in others) issue in the goon fc team is simple, there’s a lot of competent people, if you wanna be different and get salty, you get shunned and someone else who’s willing to play by the rules will take your place.
---
Red didn’t play that game well, he’ll do well in nc. So good luck to him
---
Interesting idea!  I'll pass it along to our audio developers.
---
Yeah I try to be fair and balanced! Just like Fox News!
---
hi welcome to eve! where there's alts...
---
you wouldnt say that in autz
---
In their favour, Triglavians seem to have a better AI and fleet discipline... and do they come with abyssal clouds or they left those back home?
---
RIP Redline 2017, you will be missed.
---
Man your fleets were one of the best ive had... Feels bad to see you leave, but thanks for working hard to provide content
---
Public bot execution might discourage someone else from botting.  
---
CCP is doing fine.
---
Lmao wrong
---
Go ahead and do what?
---
You're probably the only person that did Ressource Wars.
---
Next time you run all that, hit ctrl-shift-esc to open up task manager and see which of the listed is at peak capacity, then make your own conclusions. I'd bet on 1050ti but I can not say for sure
---
you measured penises with boys in the school yard!?
---
Be quiet, Karan.
---
Very smooth experience as well.
---
Sounds nice, do you really need to train the other racial battleship or is it good enough with just lvl 3?
---
I never flew with him, who the fuck is he?
---
&gt;outnumbered again
---
More needs to be made of this.
---
yes he was
---
can you post your specs ? :P
---
No idea. From what I've heard he was a competent FC that got fucked over by Goons, but details seem thin on the ground.
---
is it that period of the month already ?
---
Thank you for your kind words of support /u/Dildo_Juggler
---
Change is bad right?
---
Lol
---
We've won the battle, not the war. Complacency kills. It's good that you're coming out for fights, but I wouldn't say "F goons" just yet. They're still the largest alliance, leading the largest coalition, in the game and they have a peerless industrial system going that, thus far, we haven't been able to more than mildly disrupt.
---
We have a lot of fights, and a lot of losses, ahead before endsieg.
---
I wish to speak to your manager!
---
I like it when people who never undock tell me what's going on inside the game referring to charts and shit
---
This is how an asshole writes Reddit posts.
---
I wonder, if he's as nice as you claim then what would your alliance have had to do to him to make him this upset with it?
---
Returning player as well, great content in your answer! Thx
---
It matters to people who don't have anything else in their life that does.
---
Hmm, PanFam undocked all the things. Where are those one meme's about docking up and not fighting?
---
You say that, but that sounds exactly like PanFam's strategy, not Goons'.
---
i meant im happy to keep going,
---
fuck goons, i wonder if all of thier players will continue to shitpost with nothing so far actually worthwhile to back it up, and continue to join goon fleets when they loose anytime we put up a stand. 
---
im not complacent even if i seem it, i fully understand goons might, and what is no doubt inevitable, im just enjoying the painful journey goons are going through to get there.
---
The gay starts young.
---
Drones only attack if the **initial attack** on them or your ship happened within drone control range, if it started outside that range and then they coasted into range the drones still won't attack. This is the only logical explanation given  the situation as you described.
---
So increase your drone control range by training up Drone Avionics to lvl 3-4 and you're good.
---
Just alts
---
Get good loot on the solos though? Isk per hour with triple loot at t3?
---
Not sure, training to 4 doesn't take that long, 
---
It it increases your falloff, which is good, means you need to burn less to kill rats, and thus complete missions faster.
---
Gosh if only you could, I dunno, fight the invasion till it left or something. Nah, literally impossible, better to whine about CCP doing anything without asking highsec bears first.
---
Remember those times you wrote AARs that didn't make you look like a massive piece of shit? :P
---
That's a great tutorial, thanks! Will try to learn to do it properly in some time. Btw, could you please give me a link to the modified model of Hel you used for printing?
---
Ah, yes, posting on r/eve will definitely help you out in this situation.
---
Cool, will try tonight. Thanks for the feedback 👍
---
if you have any emotional attachment at all to spaceships CCP wins
---
&gt; (left goons xx days ago) .... repeat
---
Why am I not surprised the pie chart looked like it did ...
---
A healthy dose of distrust will get you far in eve. But join a good corp. Eve uni is definitely one of the better ones. They are a good good first step for you. And make sure to be active on voice coms in whatever corp you join.
---
more in which way?
---
if you mean we need to keep it up. sure hope we do.
---
if you mean goons wernt outnumbered, the numbers ive seen is 800 goons subs and a est 400goon super fleet unused,
---
vs
---
600pamfam subs and a 200man superfleet memed at the end
---
IE: 600vs800 and prevail through them being the attacker and misjudging the cost to them and advantage to panfam that part has
---
Sigh... We shouldn't had let Mutafakaz troll in local
---
I just wish you hadn't put the timer when you did, I would have loved to have been there but I had to work in the morning.
---
Coalitions and large alliance have been a thing since BoB- People forget this while spinning their rose tinted glasses rhetoric that eve, somehow, was better back in two-thousand-and-something
---
Hi u/bbtb2 was this https://zkillboard.com/kill/77012457/ your Nyx   https://zkillboard.com/kill/75752144/ ?
---
&gt;  left goons 22 days ago 
---
Botted in goonlands for 6 monhs. Doesn't count as goon in Peligro's chart. Therefore there are no bots in Delve.
---
So leave your boring bloc and do so?
---
Redline wasn't a strat fc when he left.
---
It depends what countries or commands you were focusing before changes and how mow deep levels you've already acquired.
---
Generally Command ships are still strong and is needed in the battlefield for its boosting abilities and decent tank.
---
*Ex. Vultures follow ferox fleet well and is more than double the EHP in max skills. And it shield burst will give 21.6% bonus for both resistance and HP. This is a great difference if you fly command ships in the fleet and will potentially change the ratio. as well vultures can use information links which will give roughly 40 % sensor strength bonus ( forgot correct numbers ) that save your logis from hostile ECM drones.*
---
If you are gonna be flying with fleet, they are essential and needed much. You'll be loved by fleet commanders for flying cs.
---
For PVE scenes, only incursions are what command ships are essentials. For solo PVE it's not effective to be honest.
---
Sleipnir is a good thing for solo, small gang pvp or whatever because of its attributes are well balanced. Amarr and Caldari would be a thing only for fleet due to its speed. I don't know about gallente well.
---
Because bots get kicked and reported to CCP, something it appears no one else does.
---
Even my original mining alt is just training into it now lol.
---
Yes it is, it can be traded between players on an open market.
---
This AAR is more cringe than your twitch streams
---
Weird how you tried to defend your position in a genuine fashion but couldn't help yourself taking salty snipes at the end there, lmao.
---
Red seems to be doing just fine with us, and it's not like we don't have rules for the FC team. Weird right?
---
Command bursts are amazing.  The math backs this up.
---
Things I use regularly in FW lowsec.
---
Skirm boosting bifrost.
---
Solo armor repping Gnosis with a single armor boost (tanks 900 DPS).
---
Damnation for our medium size fleets (30-40)
---
Magus/ponti/stork to go along with AF/logi frig fleets.
---
Slap a command burst on any t1 BC to make it and the fleet way better.
---
Be kinda in the logi bro love club cuz the logi get dank boosts.
---
The devs usually are more active on Reddit than their own forums.
---
Pepperidge Farm doesn't.
---
As a links lifer I would say absolutely, especially if you are involved in some of the big fleet engagements...if you haven’t already trained the mind link skills that can be a slog. 
---
2 benefits I can point out right off the top, besides supplying boosts for the fleet (obvs) are:
---
You are almost always prelocked by logi and most CS comps are so tanky that being primaried only happens after the logi wing burns...
---
Pro tip, max out arty skills, fly a Sleip, get top damage in every fleet that’s smaller than BS 😎
---
They save money on developing Clash of Corporations (tm) mobile game
---
It's almost like ticket types are prioritised.... :big_thonk:
---
So about this "goons can form too much" narrative? Apparently just talk i see. So can we expect more of this from the north?
---
Yeah definitely lol
---
/u/CCP_Falcon?
---
I mean in pretty much every way t3cs are BCs.
---
They have similar ehp speed and DPS.
---
Gf northerners. Its just a shame i got dunked at the outset. Bring on more gudfights i say!
---
YOU JUST GOT FLAIR BAITED
---
big bill would never, would he
---
That's wormholes for you! Dscan, dscan, dscan.... and if you can't cloak, at least probe scan from a safespot - it'll take em longer to find you, but the moment you see combats on dscan, gtfo. Anyway, it's all about the risk vs reward - find a good site and you'll make far more than your ship's worth
---
Indeed... Cathegory wise
---
FYI the entire purpose of shit talk is to get you riled up.
---
Don't let your jimmies be rustled my dude.
---
Strat FC? No. He led meme fleets and tried, unsuccessfully to have his own vanity squad. Good on him for this fight, but I suspect this will be a rarity and not the norm, NC. will tired of his incessant insistence that he is more important than he really is and he will leave in a huff. It's what Redline does.
---
He was in KarmaFleet but left because he was not considered for leadership, so went to one of the lesser corps so he could shine. He will bounce around the game like his buddy Morgan. I know, they should create a super FC corp!

#:THINKING:
---
I might just be being dumb, but you say 7pm GMT then 7pm UK time - but isn't the UK currently on GMT+1 due to daylight saving? (i.e. Eve time + 1)?
---
Did you just take this on IRL level or something? I was talking abou the game. Oh wait, your shitty flair checks out.
---
Biomass ig plz.
---
Petition for everyone on this sub to only refer to them as the Triangles from here onwards.
---
They found the undock button.
---
Well I think the day of leave marks the day these chars got their "under investigation" message and then thy got kicked to prevent stuff ...
---
The search tab in personal assets?
---
They seem to have caught some mains (the skill u and inner h*ck guys) this time, definitely just the casual botters and not the career RMTers but it's better than nothing.
---
I was dualboxing back in the day. With a carrier and a tengu. Doing havens in nullsec. Long story short, ended up smartbombing my own tengu. Billion++ loss. Alot for me back then, hehe 😁
---
Don't underestimate them. Jammers was the only thing that kept supers from rolling over subcaps.
---
PANFAM dropping supers on Goon battleships. Wew lad...
---
About 200m per hour, soloing T3 in a frigate
---
Better than cruiser T4, but worse than cruiser T5
---
Wait, you actually had a ticket answered in minutes? What century was that in?
---
It's like in the middle ages: Who cares if someone gets the shoes of the beheaded, the crowd had a blast watching someone lose his head and that's what counts.
---
Well, I haven't been in delve much since probably April, I'm just hella limited on gaming time with young kids and work rolling wide TF open. I'll definitely be showing up as I can,even if it's just me and my sabre. Glad you're having a blast though mate :)
---
lol more frigate trash ... zzz
---
go fly a real ship coward
---
Def not underestimating,  i have flown with each side at some point. All i am saying is the whole "we cant defend against goons" narrative doesnt really hold weight after this, imo.
---
Ships in EVE are expendable. Expect to lose everything you undock and always follow rule number one which is do not fly what you cannot afford to lose. 
---
I have not once lost a ship exploring though I don’t do wormholes much. I have always played the game in null sec though. 
---
You find yourself a safe spot, cloak up and scan, watch local and if somebody comes into local dscan constantly until you know if they are coming at you or not, and then cloak up again and off to the next site. 
---
No it is not hard to not die living in null sec or exploring but you do need to be smart about it and accept you’ll lose ships sometimes. Especially if you’re just learning to survive.
---
Are you sure you didnt get it? I was upset about my response time but apparently I just didnt see it in my inbox while it sat there
---
Oh i like that quote
---
Had no idea you can reship from a wreck!
---
Bots got shamed and blown up. I am happy. This is good. Bots got removed from goons for being bots, this is good and I am happy.
---
Except it does, because goons have the bigger supercap fleet
---
I like it!  How much are you looking for?
---
Probably was kicked from Goons for botting and having no paps. PAPs almost guarantee player participation. All hail PAPs!!!!
---
lol triggered frigate trash downvoting me
---
No, I mean that that point needs to be hammered home. Goons can't just rest on their numerical superiority, and all the ships in New Eden don't matter if you can't get them to the fight fast enough.
---
failing to plan is planning to fail.
---
But also no plan survives contact with the enemy.
---
You got flair baited. He's a northerner.
---
It looks like that those rorquals is the same guy - no wonder as "ccp logic" let you multibox tons of them at the same time.
---
if anything, them not truely knowing the ability of thier infalted numbers means they cannot judge what they can or cannot fight.
---
I'm paraphrasing Gen. Eisenhower, IIRC.
---
Congrats to NC for undocking. Congrats to Goons for bringing content so this game doesn't die.
---
Good to have Redline on the team. Gf to all.
---
Something something quality over quantity. Oh the irony when a goon says that to a NC member. How times have changed.
---
I’m a noob, so I quite literally don’t know what you’re talking about or what you’re saying. This is some newspeak shit
---
Actually something different, look at nyx and those rorquals history/names.        
---
Cannot prove it but i think the Nyx and rorquals ... it is the same one guy.           
---
Can we remove rorquals now?
---
check nyx/rorqual history/names it looks like a signe guy alts.
---
That doesn't stop it being a micro transaction just because you can convert one currency in to another.

Open task manager, check there are no other instances of the launcher in the background. 
---
This is a common bug since tuesday
---
kill all bots
---
Well that sounds lovely to me. Do you guys have crab opportunities, too? I need to keep up my idk somehow!
---
also, titans, supers, and rorquals exploded, this is good and I am happy
---
How do you go about making the switch to 64bit?.  I can only see patch notes to show it has happened and everyone loves it.  
---
But I cannot find information on how people have made it happen?.  Please help this hungover idiot out.
---
Well it was a PVE content, that had rewards much more expensive than if you just go to the jita and buy them form the market.                
---
Idea was good, simply PVE "content" need to actually offer something in order to be worth engaging into it.           
---
Like you were losing isk if you run the resource wars.
---
but theyre shit talking give me, and no doubt others morale to fight.
---
they make themselves seem so weak and stupid. shit talk to be effective has to be in some way, correct
---
No plan survives contact with the enemy.
---
... and he sieges ...
---
On a little EVE break, is the 64bit client default or do i need to do something to use it?
---
To be fair supers were dropped five minutes before the fight was over, and after goons evac'ed what was not already fucked in bubbles.
---
for a very very long time, i said, 'im going to join somone to fight goons'
---
i dont keep up to date with nullsec politics ATALL the past near 2 years ive spent in my lowsec hole duck and diving snuffed having fun with some mates hotdropping nerds and going on fun fleets,
---
they join NC. i think, yeh sure i respect those dudes, much to my surprise theyre at war with goons. its all perfectness' rolled into one big wreckfest of goon hulls, my enjoyment. oh, and the NC. dudes and FC's are awesome. which is always nice xD
---
Supers were dropped at the very end of the fight to clear what was left of the grid, after goons retreated.
---
\\/

---
Anyone else notice tidi wasn’t too bad?
---
Brags about functioning economy and making Isk. Complains when economy actually functions and they lose Isk.
---
Great video but you're using the default overview settings so you must be some kind of murderer or psychopath irl
---
How so? Just by the differently owned citadels, or is there some kinda agreement now?
---
Did it twice past this month.
---
People tend to either remember the times they had lots of fun or it really sucked and forget everything else - I can remember a time where goons controlled from branch to period basis, had a JB network to take you the entire way with relative impunity
---
Dudes hype to shoot at me is dudes I get to shoot back at, so this is nothing but good for both of us.
---
If that what a tidi fight supposed to be like in 64bit... Well done CCP. Resounding success.
---
HOLY FUCK
---
THIS VIDEO IS AMAZING
---
What about the structure timer? Same email when it goes from 96% structure to 95%?
---
I suggest you join a corporation like Signal Cartel. They'll teach you how to explore safely and make a really good amount of ISK doing so! You might even start building friendships with the other players!
---
Nah fake shit talk works just fine if it pisses you off, which is the objective.
---
In the immortal words or Bruce Lee, be like water friend.
---
It’s in public beta testing as an option in the launcher settings.
---
“Strat FC”
---
I am the other only person that did RW from time to time ;)
---
I m in charge of the test rental programm you can send me 2 b ig and you will have your system.
---
Thanks for your interest in test rental.
---
We have those? We fire those.
---

I think that's what you're going for.
---
We've got tons of space to krab in. We're the main corp of TEST lol. I just happen to run small gang out of a big alliance.
---
I joined their chat channel last night, how friendly are they to player lacking the experience of running stealth bombers?
---
lmao get rekt
---
If only there were these things that allowed you to get between systems that you couldn’t light a cyno in. Maybe we could call the doors, and they could go between suns.
---
Sundoors. I think it’s a great idea. Writing a letter to CCP right now.
---
Who the fuck bot rats in a nag
---
No bots in goons.
---
Those bot killmails we've been getting every day were a fluke.
---
yes, they do. I had some rogues agressing me from 70 km in a 0.5 system. So, if agression begins out of drone control range, you have to lock on one rogue an activate the drones manually on him. then the drones normally shoot the whole group one by one
---
70 km is 43.5 miles
---
Oh shit really? I didn’t see any other posts and I was going crazy yesterday thinking it was a windows issue (due to some other computer stuff) 
---
Still recovering from a full reinstall last night.
---
To be fair goons DID kick this guy. Give them SOME credit.
---
Maybe their culture is shifting away from kicking people who report bots
---

---
Click the Eve E in the top right. Click settings. Click run clients with 64. OK.
---
Okay I understand, dont think 12gb ram is on the lower end?
---
pilots crave isk and convenience
---
or erebus tbh, especially fitted like that
---
Yep, happened to me on both my desktop and laptop.
---
Same issue, same fix. 
---
Crack open task manager and see if there are any duplicate instances, then close them all. You should be good to go after that.
---
This. As we're finding cruising through Delve and PB lately, everybody's got bots. I'm curious what bot hunters find in TAPI space.
---
This post is more cringe than the AAR.
---
So at least Imperium won something of importance in the last 24 hours.
---
A sound card just plays the audio stream that's provided to it.  The EVE client generates that audio stream, which is where the bottleneck is coming from.
---
lol
---
i mean yea, of course, duh.  but then why would one want to hold sov as well?  sov is a fucking headache if you can just pve without the stress.
---
&gt; won eve terminally
---
Still here.
---
Still pushing propaganda.
---
Still not winning, just not logging in.
---
The one who didn't run away?
---
Think he means right click an item and choose "search in personal assets" - opens your items window and gives all locations where you have that item.
---
We always call this system "Penisman" ;)
---
Thanks, will log on after work and check it out
---
True if they did. Or maybe he got banned, and then Goons kicked him. The bottom line is they can't cite Peligro data when I say there are bots in goon regions. I'm not saying its entirely botlands, but I'm saying they have as much as anyone else which means they can't claim moral high ground on botting matters.
---
Propaganda or dismay of my exFC I flew many hours together?   
---
Also I believe selling everything and biomassing characters is winning eve, because theres nothing to log into, but you do you, little pet!
---
Imagine wanting to comment something so hard you use the same overused meme as 20 other guys in this post 
---
Also imagine being xenuria
---
Thank you!!.
---
ofc, without enemies there is no content,
---
i dislike anyone who has joined goons in the past year however, on a game only level.
---
theyre sheep, and weak f1 pushers to my knowledge (all goon linemmebers ive met and had fly with me have openly admitted to knowing nothing about flying thier ship and pvp. they just follow commands as they can)
---
i hope goons drop thier excess membership and go back to a normal fightable force to make for more fun for all sides xD
---
A perfect score. You mad man.
---
When did you join NC. Redline ? Dang mate always loved your fleets. Nevertheless, hope you have a good stay in that alliance and wish you all the best.
---
Triglavians like 3’s
---
You do know that the corp leaders would not know about the investigation in order to kick, right?
---
&gt; Also I believe selling everything and biomassing characters is winning eve, 
---
Still not winning.
---
You’ve won when you don’t spend your day talking about a game you claim to not care about because you don’t log in.
---
I don’t really give a shit if you biomassed yourself in game. Or “sold everything” though if you were *really* quitting then why bother selling anything at all? The reality is that you’re still here, so you still haven’t won.
---
You can sell everything in *various* ways, but keep pushing what you think you know.   
---
Hell why bother, i RMTed out with a fucking hefty sum and happy about it.
---
I stand corrected thanks fuzz
---
Well, if he got banned 22 days ago, then brought into hisec to get nuked, that's odd.
---
Possible tho.
---
They definitely don't have the moral high ground. I get bored easily bot hunting but a lot of guys in my corp have been camping Delve lately. Nearly everyone who's a real person went on deployment.
---
Go look at their fucking krab numbers. A lot of that is bots. We don't have enough hunters to comment on even rough percentage, but from our sample size of covering a third or so of delve regularly, probably half ish?
---
As it so happens I am also in Cville. We had one tiny Eve meet a few years ago. Hidden Fremen from Lazerhawks ran it. Maybe we should organize another sometime this summer.
---
since when was making someone laugh and pity at someone else's dumb statements 'pissing someone off'
---
the sad part is goons linemebers are so tunnel visioned they dont see truth. in which my post regarding the subject is aimed to ellaborate to them why what they chant is wrong. they should chant somthing at the right times. or chant somthing actually effective, i guess the issue there being is theyve achieved nothing to chant and post about worthwile yet.
---
until then theyll keep saying nc. doesnt undock when they do (its fine to post this WHILST nc. are actually docked up)
---
Bot Dragon can go to hell lol
---
There was an agreement. That way they stop shitting up highsec and can remain in null without bashing eachothers things. Tbh. Anyone who uses them essentially pays for their srp funds and everything. From imperium to test to horde. Yes a pilot still got paid regardless in jita, but now those alliances are getting the taxes too. 
---
Essentially think about the old moon goo pacts which name escapes me atm. But was a massive nullsec agreement before the moon shakeup when test owned fountain and delve.
---
&gt;actually believing that ever was a culture within 
---
It's so retarded I can't tell if troll or not.
---
&gt; Well, if he got banned 22 days ago, then brought into hisec to get nuked, that's odd.
---
I don't think that would be odd. That would be CCP using confirmed botter assets to create some content in hisec around new content week with lots of people already logged in.
---
Just adapt. Duh.
---
It's nice to see only one bitching botter this week compared to like 20 before I went on vacation.
---
Hello gentlemen and ladies, and welcome to the tour of the Redline Saltmines. Recently this new salt vein was discovered and opened. Anyways, let's start with the tour shall we?
---
On the left we have the newest rage in the salt connoisseur world, named Bitter Disappointment. This recent new salt vein was discovered when we moved some old jars with brain tissue inside around. Apparantly the person who left them behind didn't use them anyways. 
---
Further down the hallway you can see the previous Flavour of the Month, called REeefusing To Adhere to Reasonable Deductive Advice, also shortened to RETARD Advice. For some reason we mined tons of it, but it never sold really well. I think our marketing advice fell on deaf ears. 
---
Now in the back on the right side, you can see the masterpiece of our collection. It is the good old classis Switcharoo Salt. Basically this is plain salt, but because we took the standard label off and put a special label on it, people think it is special. It is kinda like when you play a video game, get mad and are now shooting your former buddies in a superior tactical situation, then running to reddit to post about it. Anyways I digress.
---
We thank you for your visit to our Salt Museum and we are hoping to see you around!
---
\*Please buy a little salt shaker for €4,99 on your way out to help support your local Salt Museum!\*
---
You're talking about in delve right? You know the guys you are dunking down there are publicly shamed by the general population of goons. 
---
Don't get me wrong. You are killing big things...but when goons are done removing sov we will just come home and pick up literally where we left off. I don't think our wall of shame bois have allowed you to deal any kind of blow to the economy. 
---
Also GF last night. I was pretty sad we got penor kicked last night. Excited to be apart of some more penor kicking though.
---
All this smack talk from a group of people that evac their space is laughable. We brought the fight to you and you ran. You are picking your engagements and winning those but your space is getting shit on. You are shit. Forever will be shit. Accept it.
---
I don't mind that hope, and we could definitely trim some fat, but from what goon history I've learned over the years, that's literally never been the MO.
---
Aha, thanks for the explanation. As much as I do fondly remember Horde's original Perimeter campaign (mostly because of how much fun it was to kill highsec mercs)... Yeah, fuck the endless bashing contests. Makes sense to just share the taxes 3 ways.
---
i have my shitfit praxis ready to go in system, dont shoot that praxis :)
---
If just about ANYTHING on my timeline goes 22 days someone's getting fired and/or sued, I have no idea how this is considered acceptable to anyone.
---
I mean this could just be fake.
---
the top 50% of goons i respect, how they do things, same or different. old school goonies like, yeh whatever,
---
but when the shit hits the fan and goons have thier own little invasion to deal with, goons numbers will drop hard. theyre the half of goons i dont care for. the weak.
---
Tough target for goons, well defended panfam - sounds like we might be seeing some good wee skirmishes )
---
This has to be the most sore winner post in history.
---
yes.  64BC has nothing to do with tidi, only performance in large fights.  tidi is a server-side fuction only.
---
imagine the amount of people that would still be playing if they hadnt have left due to aids shit like crashing durring massive battles. Imagine if they had swapped to 64bit when the rest of the industry had.
---
Its extremely easy to do with Hawks. Orbit the conduit between 7-10km, if you get Karybdis or other beefy battleships that kite, you can just orbit them at 5km and they will spin in place.

I mean eve is a frankenstien of code made from devs that have moved on in multiple stages and no one knows what half the code does. At least in WoW they have some sort of idea what 98% of the code is or will do or documentation. Eve from a code standpoint i think we are lucky each patch that it still boots.

Redline if you weren't such a dildo this might be cool you won 1 fight. Who gives a fuck about a 30 bil swing. That will get made up when all the fucking shitadels come out of final rfs.

Not worth it for pve due to t3cruisers, have some niche but important roles in various forms of pvp.
---
I don't think so.  
---
I think, he got banned in march. Check the last killmail of the Nyx pilot.  [https://zkillboard.com/character/2113575060/](https://zkillboard.com/character/2113575060/)   
---
Two months later a corp director kicked him from corp, because he didn't login for other a month, or he wasn't able to get enough PAPs in April, while being banned.
---
People like you are what keep the alliance and all of New Eden alive and well. Keep taking those blind leaps into things you don't know with the knowledge that Brave has your back and you'll never run short of fun in his game. 7o my man and see you in space!
---
I'll show you fucking grudge matches mate.
---
I have alts in goons am I a goon
---
I love those guys though. They give us cannon fodder, CASH MONEE from ratting forever, a ton of cherrypicked minerals, and things to point and laugh at when they're dying at home during war. 
---
AND as a bonus, they give you guys content and incentive to come party. I mean really, everyone wins here.
---
I wonder how much isk they got away with  before they got caught
---
^This
---
The T2 hulls are T1 hulls retrofitted by the empires. 
---
As such they have been trademarked by the empires via New Eden maritime law XD.
---
Please do. And bring up shortening timers, they're way too long to feel satisfying. HQ timers should be like j-space timers imo.
---
Yup. A valid reason to wage war/bash otherwise. But they are not wanting to focus on highsec. Not sure if the split is even. I'd imagine it favors test ever so slightly for the services ran etc.
---
But yeah no problem. Too much eve history and shit in my brain from the last decade.
---
I would agree with that in terms of timers for low powered structures...
---
great video, reminiscent of tomalaks stuff, keep at it
---
some really close fights which was fun to watch, maybe cut away a few of the less interesting ones so it's not 23m in total
---
Your right. We lost all our shit and have only rookie ships. But with our morale we can surely win this war.... economics play a roll.
---
Corp mate with a similar rig to me constantly crashed and couldn’t get back in, he was running 32bit while I was on 64. Everything was great for me!
---
I was gonna guess a 40-30-30 split with TEST on the 40. Theres a ludicrous amount of money in the Perimeter market, that kind of cashflow must pay for pretty much all subcap SRP for everyone
---
Made another topic last night when I was with TEST in SAI. Just one client but full graphics, brackets, OBS, Mumble, discord and around 10-12 tabs in Chrome. 
---
Client performed amazing even if it was pretty heavy TiDi, I managed to get amazing screenshots while not dcing once. Bes qol change ever.
---
You seriously signed a post that has your name on it already. Wtf.
---
no jay_amazingness pings :smugdon:
---
Oh lol, gg me
---
Can you please post you rig config. 
---
Looking forward to switch on 4 k here. 
---
Some eve player already working great conf might help.
---
Thank you.
---
I think you're mistaking him for someone relevant, he instead was the guy who lead peacetime fleets to horde space then would cry on reddit when they'd drop caps on him.
---
I've been on plenty of his fleets in horde and they were always fun.
---
I wouldn't count on these ships or fits to be what they were ratting in.  CCP likely just had a list of people on the chopping block for previous botting + the subset of those that were online and grabbed them from whatever they were in/their biggest ship and teleported them.  The nag guy, for example, has plenty of VNI losses.
---
Youre missing the point. If an aggressor decides to go seal clubbing, and doesnt want to actually fight, then they should easily loose thier HQ structure. 
---
Most noobie corps that get wardeced,  and try to fight back, have no way to. And with TZ tanked bullshit, they still dont
---
Bots asking for their capitals back is obviously a priority 😂
---
Yeah, I think I need to redo my binds for that as well. There are only so many keys, though, what a pain in the ass. Especially when you have a ton of active modules that you need to work heat on.
---
Agreed
---
That sounds plausible to me tbh.
---
GF panfam, looking forward to the next one!
---
Tnx
---
Sleips are still very good, though Muninns for alpha and Drekavaks for whaling have largely replaced them in the meta right now. They're still your go-to boosting ships.
---
I have a thing planned with Claymores.
---
Wow, you came back for a second helping of downvotes.
---
I mean DSC are russians and *ahem* semi well known in Delve for questionable stuff. I highly doubt it's BBTB.
---
Brand Newbros honestly would be my go-to, but that's probably because I've been having great luck mentoring these guys into small gang pilots and having a fuckton of fun with them.
---
I was gonna say I’m pretty sure I having mining frig V with the ability for T2 huffers for ninja huffing so I guess I’m doing good for the situation I’m in then.
---
bigbillthabot3 :thanging:
---
Come on dude, that only happened like 11 or 12 times at most.
---
Now I understand why the Draugur sucks dicks. It's made with minmatar ductape. It worse then the kikimora in every way. And with just 3 mid slots doesn't work as a command dessie either.
---
Is that where we are now?  The reason Goons aren't on the chart is because we're better than others at kicking them out... and that's a bad thing?
---
I love him too &lt;3
---
400m is a good starting point. You can still do career agent missions as an old player. Welcome back to eve. Exploration and PvE sites are a good way to get your head back in the game, remember how to fly, remember that the default overview sucks, etc.
---
Discover yourself, and don't let Reddit just tell you to join a big null bloc right away. There IS more to eve than that. :)
---
Did goons show you the dont fc anymore button yet?
---
Jita and Jita 44 undock in particular is the most unsafe spot in all New Eden. Lots of ppl forget this, including vets. 
---
Don\`t feel bad, take it like this: it was an expensive lesson but now u have the chance/motivation to read/learn how to keep your ships safe in high sec
---
I'd like to press F for a friend, /u/Acia_Saraki, you'll be missed. Also countdown to your titan loss.
---
When are you going to address the botting allegations
---
Hilariously Blizzard and Wargaming also only did that this year/last year.
---
Didn't make any claim on that. My claim is there are enough bots in goonlands for you to bep unable to talk about other people's botting and be consistent.
---
No enemy contact survives with the plan
---
We had guys dropping from fleet during that time, and got one kill of a bait Hurricane that I'm pretty sure just lagged the fuck out on a gate lol.
---
Are you saying there is something wrong with an anti-bot consensus among the community? That's what it seems like...
---
Lmao just as i thought you couldn't get more retarded
---
You can't say the L word around here. That's a ban sir.
---
Didn't get the trit when I tried it in a keepstar.
---
I tried the 64 bit client and seems my client resolution is fucked up and all text in game becomes kinda blurry, after switching back to 32 bc and every thing is fine.
---
Is that by design or just me encountering this issue?
---
Well, at least one of the kills in the Draugur was good. Cyno, bot...at least the corm took a fight. Not sure what the Punisher was. Better get the recon alt tho.
---
He should leave the ship and then hit the board corvette button. Should get him in a new one. If he boards the old one. He should leave the ship, repackage it, reprocess it and then hit board corvette.
---
I believe I had a T1 adaptive hardener and prototype repairer. Or something like that. Moved into a gnosis to start exploring Corp space
---
why don't red join gal and blue join cal
---
Keen to see you guys on the other end of my atrons tackle :)
---
Mute if you just want pretty visuals, this was done live last night a single crash but overall very good. 3d mouse really make it a lot of fun to cover these fights especially after fleets drop in. Good fight, happy I stayed up late
---
&gt;The bottom line is they can't cite Peligro data when I say there are bots in goon regions.
---
No one is saying Peligro's data says we don't have bots.  Everyone has bots.  We know.  Peligro's data does, however, show that for an alliance as old and large as we are to not show up on there indicates that we are not getting many bans.  If we were as bot infested as the renter regions, we would expect to at least show up on there.  We don't.  It's a data point.
---
&gt;I'm saying they have as much as anyone else which means they can't claim moral high ground on botting matters.
---
Yes, you are asserting that, contrary to the limited evidence we have.
---
:ok_hand:
---
Not for me :( blank background every time I jump in to a system, had to docked, roll back to 32bit to cure it.
---
tbh, DSONS was getting chewed out for having unregistered (ESI-wise) characters in corp.  I wouldn't be surprised if their bans were just because Atrum put a gun to their head and told them to fix their ESI.
---
Good bot.
---
Fuck brand newbros fuck test. Brave or Horde are the only decent newbro nullsec alliances.
---
And during this "war" when subcap fights do break out the goon fleet usually gets clapped. On the Nc side we've only fed like 40 munnins and a bomber fleet and that's it.
---
No, but now as long as there is supply of purchased, unused "gems", they can be sold for the resource that isn't "premium" (isk) and essentially become an acquirable good in the game.
---
I'm not taking any sides on whether PLEX is a microtransaction or not, but it is definitely not "the same" as those gems.
---
I've been getting them 3-4 times a week. Went 3b green in hecates last night because of bads, so I guess that's a helldunk, but yknow what? I had 8 guys. I'm callin that a w.
---
Fuck Brave, they don't even undock to defend their staging JB from simple farmers.
---
Fuck Horde for the skinheads.
---
botcheck rvb lul
---
Hey man don’t shit on your coalition members like that, test is literally subhuman so...
---
Unfortunately sharing modified versions of CCP's IP still falls in the "not okay" category. For now this tutorial is the best I can do for you. There's a good chance I'll do a panel on 3D printing at Eve North, so tune in. I hope to make you learn a thing or two at least.
---
this was a much needed post thank you
---
&gt; Like maybe if structures anchored in enemy sov have the same vulnerability timer of the system owner's sov? System indexes are inversely proportional effects to enemy structure vulnerablity timers as well.
---
Nah dude, defenders have too many advantages already (in null). The problem with TZ tanking in null is that a system of warfare that already revolves around way too many timers gets ludicrous if the timers all get set away from the attackers, as has happened many times in the last couple years.
---
Perhaps people could midpoint supers in case a cyno jammer went down? Rather than into a pre-setup defense with tons of bubbles
---

EST is the worst.

You come home from work and you get the end of EUTZ. And when you go to bed so you can go to work, its in the middle of USTZ

Wait, have I come to helldump on goonfleet by accident?

Stay strong brother and all reps on your heart

Maybe you asked a dumb question

NWFLT - Brand Newbros - is always looking for people and are happy to help newbies learn.
---
There's also Pandemic Horde, Eve University, and Brave Newbies OTOH.
---
Aideron Robotics is another great newbie corp moving back to Gallente facwar right now.
---
Lol hilarious.
---
The pontifex that died is mine. It died to BBTB's station camping. BBTB typically dropped his own capitals on me during station camping.
---
I couldn't believe you guys formed as well as you did, good job, I was impressed. BTW BR is incorrect, you are missing a few kills.
---
4 DSONS members down, now they just need to kick 584 more to stop being terrible
---
Left a nullsec corp and moved all my stuff back to Jita with the help of the alliance freighter service.
---
I brought a freighter, put all my things in it (like 8b worth in ships and mods) and i also thought it was a good idea to take a public contract or 2 with me because i was heading to that direction and would be nice to earn 70m isk extra. 
---
I undocked and 5 jumps later i lost everything i had + the 2 multibillion collateral contracts. 
---
Was sitting in my pod at my old homesystem with all my stuff gone.
---
I didn't play for over a year. 
---
Yeah. That was fucking stupid of me.
---
how did the 64 bit client hold up overall?
---
Did you have to turn off brackets?

Aideron Robotics likes this.

Command Destroyers are where it's at.

Love it.  We killed this botter awhile ago on the night local broke and he still isn't banned.  I cannot say that I'm surprised.
---
The popcorn you mean?
---
I've always appreciated posts from this one. Seems to know how to talk to people.
---
Haha big bill the bot
---
Or just dont vote for your block?
---
ah a perfect score you say?
---
Niiiicee, that looks like it was fun.
---
The most surprising thing in this thread is Redline is in NC. A year ago I would have been surprised but I guess its not so shocking now a days.
---
Yeah it was okay.
---
"use ingame tools to report bots" is being chewed down people's throats every fireside fyi
---
You can't smug over a conflict you are losing. Be grateful they didn't fully drop the hammer on you. 🙄
---
Wait what? Is this an unironic attempt to claim I have a ratting bot?
---
Well maybe you should stop avoiding the question and clarify.
---
Because RvB is barely active enough anymore to do that. 
---
I would have tnought it would have been more active since alphas are now a thing but its a shell of what it used to be.
---
yeah they play a role, but that role is easily accomplished
---
it's like saying farting plays a role in your good grades at school, despite being totally autonomous and ridiculously easy
---
The audio was muted by Twitch for possible copyright issues.
---
yeah I remember they 'officially' shut down a while back, and most of their leadership and support moved on. not much reason to join them now with Horde, brave, karmafleet available
---
Yep - runs fine.  No issues to report.
---
How you hurf blurf
---
Bro what happened to you? This is some serious trash commentary and not even close to how it went down. At least when you were with us you would border line tell the truth and not just be full salt? Yikes  
---
At least one dude got the AAR pretty close:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bv4uij/aar\_battle\_of\_whjca\_sh1\_ihub/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bv4uij/aar_battle_of_whjca_sh1_ihub/)
---
JF time. The solution is more injectors
---
Yeah same issue. Two null corps fighting each other - both have their structures in holding corporations outside the alliance.
---
Wouldn't actually flip the aggressors structures with the exception of a HS HQ.
---
EUTZ is good USTZ is pretty dead, seems like USTZ is hotter for solo in amarr/minnie atm.
---
I hope we see more of this. I just like content.
---
 There were only deserters in Delve. Deserved death met them.
---
Ah thank you kept thinking BOTEC for some reason.
---
Some peeps do shit in this game for fun, disregarding the isk factor. OP is probably one of those.
---
Has anyone seen these triangle brains getting blapped by Concord yet?
---
That's great I'm a gonna do some shipspinning tonight. For sure
---
I should also clarify that i think low ADM should completely blow open vulnerability timers in nullsec. Unused space should be extremely vulnerable.
---
The point of forcing vulnerability timers for all structures in a system together is that defenders only have advantage if they are against an attacker from a different TZ. If both parties are primarily active during the same TZ, the defender's ADMs should fall rapidly  if the attacker can disrupt thier krabbing activities. Once ADMs fall, TZ tanked structures are vulnerable at more reasonable hours.
---
If the owner of the TCU determines the vulnerability timers of all the structures in a system, then its easier for a defender to keep thier system clear of enemy tz tanked citadel spam, and easy for an attacker to clear a system of structures once they flip the TCU. If a defender decides to TZ tank, they make it harder for themselves to fight enemy stuctures in thier own space, ADMs fall, and so soon does the rest.
---
It gives advantages to defenders that dont TZ tank, and maintain high ADM. It gives advantages to attackers if the defender tries to avoid actually fighting. Win-win?
---
I don't know how other alliances do it, but our diplos handle bot reports (as well as telling people to use ingame tools) and investigate very quickly. Someone pings a bot he's verified in less than an hour usually.
---
Obviously they can't kick for people using the ingame reporting tool, it doesn't log anyway. They don't want people reporting them internally, which I personally find very odd.
---
Wow... that looks excellent. They did it!?
---
Did you have sound on?
---
Seriously. 5b ship no drugs no implants what.
---
thanks for that informative tip, but it didnt answer my question.
---
It's 2 years since my last Astero's loss.  
---
WH exploring everydays
---
No contact survives the enemies plan
---
I'm really interested in getting started in this game. Are there any good newb-friendly corps to join who use discord and hangout?
---
In Stuarts Draft here, won't drive to DC for anything, but would meet in C'ville or on this side of the mountain.
---
Were some of the prior super bots killed in Jita *not* banned? Yikes.
---
It was a pretty fun fight even knowing we wouldn't win. Thanks for at least writing a decent AAR unlike redline. That dude apparently went full cancer when he left goons and I feel for you. From the perspective of the Baltec FC your bombs didn't do a whole lot. Whoever got that initial boosh and split the baltecs to start the fight was deserves some mad props and you glossed over him. His splitting the fleet allowed three fleets to focus fire on baltecs while logi were far away. Additionally, it didn't matter since most ships were just being alpha'd between over 200 eagles and the muninn fleet.   
---
The dreads warping in were able to alpha baltecs (as you would imagine 20 HAW dreads would). So after we lost mass to break eagles we swapped to the dreads. You bringing the dreads in is the only reason we got some decent isk value in kills so thanks for that. Prior to going in we already knew the timer was lost and wanted to just have a fight since everyone stayed up late (my wife is still saying im stupid for having stayed up till 3am...).  
---
One correction on the supers - PanFam didn't jump them in until Imperium capitals returned home and our fleets all were warping out. Whoever you caught with them were the idiots who didn't prop-on and align when called for. We all know you would never use those capitals without the Imperium cap fleet at least one mid away so don't pretend they put in any work.
---
I'm sure the bots feeling are mega hurt right after it read your shame post about it.
---
I turned off the overview to fly around but had full brackets on and wasnt an issue when I did
---
It’s much more accurate, even if it looks worse
---
But it totally isn’t.  And it ALSO looks awful.
---
It's another thing we lost to the Citadel expansion, tbh.
---
When I go cruising into the sunset with a bowhead full of marauders? That's wormhole drama.
---
Small world; I work in Draft. I know there are some people down near Roanoke as well . Could be interesting to try and get a small meetup going
---
Highsec wormholes are frequently camped for easy ganking oppurtunities. 
---
If you are just starting out, do the career missions and once you are re-acclimated go to lowsec and find a wormhole. Lowsec wormholes are much safer than hs ones.
---
Alone? Nobody shot him?
---
Undock button?
---
We have like 10 to 20 ppl on daily base in fleet. Nothing in compare to the early days.
---
Eve changed. So RvB need to change too.
---
Since we are in FW we got new players in Corp everyday.
---
FW is new to mostly all. Pilots in rvb now. But we enjoy it. Roaming is easier if the enemies warp to you
---
Oh F--- and i am having beer outside !
---
I'm bringing a FAX to roleplay as European Goonion v the world.
---
I'm fully expecting to be told to drop this guy.
---
What's the obsession with being "relevant" and what does that even mean to you?
---
The porpoise mines like a barge with it's drones (drone skills) and gives mining and shield boosts (boosting skills). If you have poor drone skills you will get less yield, if you have poor boosting skills your cousin will have a less than optimal yield but still better than no boosts at all.
---
So, depending on everyone's skills, you could do the porp while your cousin flys a mining ship and you could boost him while he dumps into your cargo hold. Ultimate results will vary depending on skills.
---
So why don’t they just do a hot fix where it detects what time zone you’re in and automatically applies the timer to the zone your in? Makes structure bashing fun and competitive for defending still and all that. Just a thought from someone who’s trying to get back into the game lol.
---
For sure.
---
I just shot coffee out of my nose, thanks for that.
---
lol, I would like to believe they wouldn't have done that... but I know better.
---
I just hope that they take the, rather positive, feedback they are getting, and pump it into ironing out the bugs.
---
Assuming these gains hold out through the long run, this might actually make EVE players happy for a couple of days.
---
You guys gave good fights when I was living in Asakai, have fun!
---
Fair point, I do worry that with the ability to eat memory until it is full that in some of these big fights we might end up finding a bad memory leak in the client.  Hopefully we can get more of these big fights to test the client with :)
---
Scoots is a good guy!
---
Also they were outplanned, like Asher said. Engaging the enemy on an offensive timer which is 95% done for the defender is borderline retarded.
---
We cannot defend against the might of the blob when the blob can apply its full force, which was sadly for them not the case here.
---
Yeah, even some of the weird bugs, like the lasers from nowhere seemed to go away.
---
&gt; No one is saying Peligro's data says we don't have bots. 
---
https://twitter.com/TheMittani/status/1126593231951728643d
---
This is saying exactly that the accusations that you have bots is false due to Peligro's data.
---
&gt; If we were as bot infested as the renter regions, we would expect to at least show up on there.
---
"Bot infested" can mean many things. If you mean you don't have as high bot/real people ratio as some others then you are right. But that's because you have lots of real people. I think you enjoy similar amounts of botting tax/income as much as other alliances, which are smaller. Say we go with this definition of "bot infested" for a second.
---
Yes, one would expect bot infested alliances to be in the chart. But one can't say just because you aren't in the chart you aren't bot infested. That would be a logical fallacy, namely affirming the consequent. There would be many reasons why you aren't on the list despite rampant botting, such as [having to kick botters](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98517701/) due to them feeding hunters like us, [botters in your rental regions](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Period_Basis/TN25-J#npc) not being reported/banned yet, and botters in Delve not being reported due to being concealed in Delve's crowd.
---
Murphy said it better
---
It's also too easy for large blocs to project their greatest strength.  I do not understand the design decision that led to capital ships being the most mobile ships in the game.  Then again, I don't really understand why we have supercarriers and titans at all.
---
Howdy folks:  its been a while since i last played and last round around i was a miner with a porp support role mostly,
---
but i want to get back in ( the new ship faction and such tempt me). what i have atm is a RNI and a few smaller Gilas and caracas..
---
what would i need to get back in to blowing up ships? any corps or groups that would be recommended for that ?
---
thanks :D
---
That is a possibility.
---
I know that a corpmate has a much better system then I do and kept crashing during the fight on 32bit.  I have a fairly mixed bag machine (Ryzen 7 2700x, 32gb ram, RTX2070) and didn't crash once on the 64bit.  The client was also notably more responsive vs. previous engagements I have had like this.
---
My client, at one point, was eating 4.5 gb of ram.
---
If nothing else, it at least shows there probably aren't many glaring bugs in the new client.
---
Never underestimate someone that can put a link between NC not undocking and an anti-bot consesus.
---
Theory checks out.
---

o7 everytime mate
---
I bound my module slots to QWERTY, ASDFG, and ZXCVB, and I've never found that setup wanting.  Because of the way the rows of keys and the rows of modules are both slightly offset, it actually matches up very well, and it makes for very intuitive, very easy-to-use hotkeys.  Number keys are then for drones, and anything else you need can be assigned to the right half of the keyboard.
---
Damn, aren't you fucking bitter as hell.
---
That might be a good thing, tho. Medium citadels are far too cheap for their purpose, and are spammed for trolling far too much. Forcing people to put some ISK on the line to keep them alive, and not just get saved by TZ tanking it, could help with that problem.
---
This isn't how you fix the problem. Just fucking ban them.
---
NC. don't care about Tribute with all the infrastructure they had in place so what makes you think they give a crap about Tenal.
---
This is just another case of GOTG the F tier coalition trying to be relevant when they have about as much impact in eve  as a fart in a cullender. 
---
Just look at the sov in Dek and Branch now, there isn't much space left for the human members of Darkness. is there. At the rate that Sort is handing out space to appease the Chinese there will be nothing left.
---
When Goons get bored and go home i think Sort will get whats coming to him and his army of autobots won't be able to shield him from Panfam's wrath.
---
Bwf horde keep star is about 7 jumps to jita. I bitch ever time I have to make a trip. Even if it was 4 i think i would still bitch. I am totally will to pay a mark up for convenience.
---
that 1050ti is going to be your first bottleneck.  Consider looking at at least a 1070, possibly a 2060 if you want longer term support.  A lot of the 1070's and 1080's are super on sale in a lot of places right now, so it is worth looking into.
---
I would look at your memory, make sure that you have identical sticks running in dual channel if it is available (it should be, look for similarly colored memory slots on your machine, make sure the identical RAM is in the same colored slots).  If you don't have identical ram, I would consider checking out newegg or amazon for some corsair vengeance 16 gig (2x8gb) sticks @ 3000Mhz.  You will need to enable an "XMP" memory profile in your bios.  Memory prices are super low right now (relatively speaking), so you can pick these bad boys up for about $80.
---
Your i5 is dated, but should still be fine.  If you update everything above, and you see that your CPU is maxing out it is probably time for an upgrade.  If money is an issue, I would check out the 2nd gen Ryzen 5 or 7.  You will need an AM4 board, but the Ryzen cards come with pretty good coolers, especially at the higher end, so you won't need to worry about that too much.  Make sure you don't buy a Ryzen card with the integrated graphics... they lose some horsepower.
---
If money is no issue, well, just buy the latest and greatest i7 or i9, drop in a 2080ti, 64gb of ram (4x16), and go on ahead and smoke some weed for me.
---
My setup:
---
Ryzen 7 2700x, 32gb of Corsair Vengeance 3000Mhz ram, RTX 2070
---
Well we had supers on standby too. It wouldn't have just been a turkey shoot. This shit would have gone to downtime.
---
Change your client from "release" to "beta" as well... I don't think it takes if you don't.
---
There is a lot of software like this. Eventually things get scrapped and reworked. Eve has actually gone through some major development cycles to fix this. There was a video on it a while ago. Will see if I can find it.
---
Edit: fount it https://youtu.be/rBJUiCHdmCc
---
The cyno-jammers were coming back online.  If Imperium had counter-dropped, they only had a short window to do it, and woulda been cut-off from any reinforcements. It's a great way to welp half a titan fleet, and lose all the momentum the campaign had.   
---
If Goon supercapital fleet was 110% ready-to-rock, they coulda done some damage. Standing down was probably the wiser approach.
---
This post is more cringe than the shit I just read over at r/niceguys . I bet you're an insufferable fuck.
---
&gt;Start shitting up on your former coalition because you won a single fight with help of other fcs and caps
---
Woah Red, I expected you to write about how good was that fight or how both parties had fun, but seems that living in the north has already fucked your brain. Oh well. Hope you don't complain about the caps in the final timer of M-0O.
---
I am currently at work after a all nighter, i did not realise i was signing up for a 3 tidi slug fest. I should gone to bed, bit it was worth it.
---
Started 2012. Still clueless.
---
See you in black rise
---
You're going to be homeless soon. The meteor is coming.
---
Get in a combat ship and help instead of just leeching with a noctis. There's a difference between newbros friendly and being a leech.
---
make sure you split the plex stacks (like 200 each stack or so) so you're sure some will drop and people can scramble to loot them
---
I don’t know if this will work, but you can try
---
I just moved to Draft last Friday.  Finally bought a house there after hobo'ing around C'ville and Gordonsville for two years.
---
I wouldn't mind Roanoke for a meetup either.  I play MtG too and I could hit up Star City Games while I was in town.
---
So to clear some stuff up, the battleship fleet had 3 full fleets and the haw dreads hitting it while the eagle and harpy fleet weren’t primaried over a 2 hour period. Logi worked really hard to help who we could through all that alpha. We lost 2 logi who got boosted off and then any other logi deaths happened when we tried to extract from the fight. Giving my logibros props for working through a very tough situation and keeping at it to the end.
---
Introductory paragraph from the article:  
---
&gt; Dealing with a single bee is a rather easy task, but removing a whole colony can be a very complicated and potentially dangerous process. For this reason, you should arrange for a professional to deal with the problem. Before you do, though, you can use some clues about the bees’ appearance and nesting to help identify the species. With this information, you can then anticipate what will need to be done to remove them, which can help you compare costs when obtaining quotes from professionals. Finally, you can then take preventative measures to reduce the chance of having to deal with this problem again. 
---
Remarkable how applicable that can be if viewed in an EVE context, lol.
---
thank god DeadCo is assisting in Tenal, thinks the Goons :)
---
Well, I am new, but I'm aware that they exist. I just don't understand it.
---
Unless these guys get banned, this is just theater...
---
They have probably made tens of billions through botting - and now they will just extract, biomass and inject another bot.
---
CCP needs to start GUID banning people / tying the ban to their hardware to make it permanent.
---
Add trig ships without telling anyone so we can watch bots die.
---
Jay please defend my space honur
---
Learning to adapt is a good thing.
---
And a good few were all in caps and or drowned in tildes.
---
More importantly insinuating that you're in DSONS
---
big o7 to you
---
Sure thing pal
---
Only panfam is botters they had 16% on that pie chart with no yearly stats!!! Goons are the alliance that does most against botting mittani said so
---
And yet, somehow his fleets were more fun than most other fc's fleets. Especially in that tz
---
That's racist. Have to call them 3 random lengths connected by nodes or something.
---
They probably made a deal, public execution and only limited ban
---
lol why r u so triggered
---
He was a super late us / au tz fc. Like around 6am eve time. Give or take.
---
It should work, but it may have an expiration date, it will say on the login screen if it does.
---
Are you being honest? I feel weird now lol.
---
Don't remove them, just make them actuall mining capitals, with boosting porpouse instead of a minimg beast
---
Nerf excavators
---
They could do nothing against Panfam by themselves. I wouldn't expect them to be able to, this is opening new fronts and losing Panfam rental income so only good news for Imperium.
---
&gt;Finally, you can then take preventative measures to reduce the chance of having to deal with this problem again. 
---
It's even the exact same thing why in eve everybody fails in bee control.
---
I think you get a messageas soon as armor get hits, and as soon as it stops getting hit.
---
it does not have expiration date, like the event items had.  I just tought maybe someone have tried that.
---
Aaaaah. Ventures do not armor tank very well. That said, it also just occurred to me that you probably got jumped by diamond rats (either pirate ones or the new Triglavian ones) rather than standard mining belt rats. For those it really doesn't matter how you fit your Venture. You need to move to a system that's not actively under invasion.
---
In your overview settings, check to make sure that diamond NPCs of all types show up. There might be a different entry for Triglavians; turn that on too.
---
Dunno about structure though. But you'll be advised about armor and shield days in advance, so it shouldn't matter.
---
Wouldn't the goon way be to bridge your paladin around wih your Titan?
---
No survive the enemies contact plan.
---
yea was hoping that someone already has :)
---
What I do is jump my accounts in. Turn of tanks and AB. And then on the mail account do the regroup command and just make it orbit the gate at 5KM.
---
You and /u/BoFap should both have a look at this randomly chosen newbro recruitment thread - lots of groups accept newer players and help them get established in the game. https://forums.eveonline.com/t/newbro-looking-for-a-corp/59470/9
---
Yeah TDSIN is known for being sketch. This is why I recommend joining another corp that has good relations with them for grouped fleets rather then joining them directly. Very unstable but won't die because wh space is not a Barron waste land with not many people contesting it unlike a few years back.
---
You should try it.
---
my thoughts precisely
---
There are still uses for command ships and they can be valuable. I wouldnt use them for PvE though, there are better options. Command destroyers kind of stepped on their toes a little for small gang or small fights, but you can still get a solid comp out of a few of the CS.
---
Sleip = probably the most versatile and balanced. Highest alpha arty platform in the medium ship size, gets decent buffer tank for fleet or can still do the old dual XLASB fit for solo stuff.
---
Claymore = gets more buffer than sleip, is fast (for a BC) and at least with HAM fits, has reasonable dps. The double rof bonus is kind of meh though, and a decent portion of its dps is behind its drones. Its also got some CPU issues. Not a bad skirmish CS, but a CD is probably better. As an FC ship its probably fine as well compared to the sleip.
---
Nighthawk = used to have a niche, but the DNI is better from a combat standpoint. 5 mids is a bit insulting for being the "best" shield race, when they claymore has 6 mids (also a missile ship). Its horrendously slow (raven is faster) and also has some fitting issues. Its still able to get decent tank, just the other issues it has takes away from its use.
---
Vulture = No real issues with it. What the vulture really needs is for the Ferox to not do 80% of its job as a sniper. As a command ship though, no real complaints.
---
Damnation = tankyboi, probably the best armor CS. Gets over 1m EHP. Dps suffers, but as far a links go, its one of the best actual command ships as far as namesake goes
---
Absolution = kind of weird with only 3 mids, not as tanky as the damnation, has reasonable damage. It differs from all the other command ships in that it doesnt have an optimal or application bonus.
---
Astarte = Decent armor skirmish command ship, especially with rails. Fairly well balanced.
---
Eos = its not terrible, but not impressive either. Its basically a tankier ishtar with links and a throwaway hybrid tracking bonus.
---
Ok: your mom=gay
---
Balance issues
---
Yep shit talk aside, it was actually worth staying up for.
---
Booshers never get love sadpanda . Also she sounds like a smart lady
---
Oh god I just realized this
---
If you redeem it into your skill point pool it should stay there until you use it right?
---
1.8/2
---
Is this better or worse than if it was a corporation whose name starts with M?
---
Im scared!
---
Yeh but when you look at the amount sold, Sabre sells 200-220 a day and flycatcher sells 15-30 a day.
---
Where in the wiki are the 40 faction citadels?
---
Mine N Refine...Mindstar... Mordus Angels... Merchi.... that’s a tough one
---
very good idea
---
Trust nobody not even yourself and if you undock you consent to pvp at all times.
---
You will fail at times and that’s ok we all do.
---
You will never know everything, no matter how much of a expert you feel you are there is always something you didn’t know about.
---
Find the part of the game you enjoy and embrace it, even when others think it’s stupid, inefficient, or silly.
---
Don’t let others who are bitter about the game make you bitter as well.
---
Make friends, talk to strangers. You will meet some of the coolest people in the would world this way.

Don't forget Ministry of Offense
---
The 'Big Three' for null-sec space are:   
---
1.) Pandemic Horde (search for the 'Join Horde' in-game channel)   
---
2.) BRAVE Newbies  
---
3.) Karmafleet (Goonswarm) 
---
Those all accept new players, and will get you up and running quickly.  There's plenty of wars happening right now, so there's lots of action in null.   
---
That said, big huge null-blocs aren't the best match for everyone, but they're a great match for many new players.
---
If you do join, here's what will happen:
---
1. They'll hand you some free ships/skillbooks
---
2. They'll give you a skill-plan
---
3. They'll give you a list of ships to train-into and keep in-stock in various places (AKA staging points)
---
4. There'll be a couple channels (discord/jabber/slack and in-game) to ask newbie questions
---
5. There'll be a schedule of fleets that you'll be encouraged (but not required) to attend
---
6. There's a bunch of ISK-making opportunities 
---
7. There's loads of people for you to make friends with
---
If your reaction to the above is "OMG Sweet! Some direction, stuff to do, and lots of people to make friends with!" Join-up with whichever one sounds good!
---
Skills in the free sp pool do count to your overall sp
---
If CCP has identified them to the point that they're willing to do this to them, I'm sure they scooped their wallets too.
---
Mostly dreads
---
In my experience, Bees will play fetch. Throw some spod and they will all go chase it.
---
Caldari is already at T5, you will have barely anyone to fight.
---
What is the point of joining?
---
Their existence is offensive
---
This is like the 2nd most important rule of all time
---
You really should have been able to kill something in that vargur lol.
---
And why did it need to be that tanky to rat:P
---
That's more or less what I have set up as well, though I use number keys for highs. What do you bind heat to?
---
I was doing so well with the fedora but when the doots came out I just couldn't take it.
---
"competant"....the irony
---
You are the one who got triggered about frigs
---
The first is don’t fly what you can’t afford to loose. Or is it everything is a scam?
---
You're just jealous because with srp and insurance, the isk cost is neglible for the line members
---
They handhold a bit, but I'd have a read-through of their website first:   
---
 [https://www.bombersbar.org/](https://www.bombersbar.org/) 
---
Just remember ABC: 
---
* Always
---
* Be 
---
* Cloaky
---
You mean the 2-3 Titans and general bads?
---
Dont fly what you cant afford to loose
---
Exactly, a brawl where caps werent a decisive factor, it was fun, would lose again...
---
cry more idiot
---
I tought maybe its better to leave unredeemed but i would get depressed if i lose it . He
---
Back from a long hiatus.  I feel like the traditional market hubs, especially Dodixie (the closest to my traditional staging) are way less well-supplied than I remember, and Dodixie in particular seems a lot more expensive relative to Jita than I remember (about a 30% markup compared to the ~10% I think I remember).
---
Is this an inaccurate impression?  If not, is the reason the advent of upwe structure markets?  And if that's the case, where should I be shopping in the Dodi area?
---
Of course they would drop after I went to bed
---
Barely? I would say that's the opposite of that what happens every night since we joined cal. 
---
We got barely gf's in BS in normal roams.
---
Tbh I was very sceptical about joining  FW.
---
But that changed. You find fights. Ppl of other cal militia join fleet and comms.  And from 6ppl small roam you end up as 21 man fleet who roams trough space and capture plexes and pew pew.
---
And the best thing for new player you get paid for it. And not bad in a not nullsec crab style.
---
About time we got a fight. Nicely done.
---
So what happens to all the bots that aren't in Caps
---
Yes.
---
You both made great points.
---
Those with alot of isk to burn
---
Wow, that looks amazing.
---
I bind heat to shift+the same key as the module.  Seems simplest and most efficient to me.
---
wooosh
---
I was new to null and PvP so I just panicked, didn’t shoot anything and forgot to bastion up.
---
I slow boated escalations in it because I couldn’t fly a tengu at the time, hence the tank. 
---
I do miss my vargur, but I like to think I’m better at the game now and I don’t really need one haha.
---
&gt;Highsec wormholes are frequently camped for easy ganking oppurtunities.
---
thats... pretty unintuitive... :/
---
That's pretty well thought out. I'm not sure that putting entosis ahead of structure timers is necessarily good for the content that people would like to see - I know TEST folks seem to like entosis, but I never have and most of the people I've flown with don't like it either. Your idea might be more attractive to me with a better sov system.
---
So... 2 titans worth of isk died?
---
I think we're overreacting a bit
---
T20 all over again
---
Welcome! :) It was a fun fight.
---
Music sucks ass lets hear some comms instead
---
Yup - https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/992qyy/hey_ccp_one_of_the_bot_supers_teleported_killed/
---
Which is why cynos need a total rework. They triviliaze logistics so everything escalates into who put a bigger blob within 7 ly of a point.
---
Yeh, i sold my Vargur and Extracted marauders V. its fun for a short while but a Loki does a similar job while being half the cost, more fun and much harder to catch:)
---
this is the AAR we need :D
---
I've said it before.
---
Can we just focus on bug fixes for the next 2 years and focus development time on porting the server code to the cloud?
---
In modern day and age there is no reason why we should have TIDI when cloud tech exists.
---
You cant handle goon comms. Also I didnt record myself freaking out when I got it, but if someone has that audio it can be posted.
---
If there's one thing that needs to be gotten rid of, it's your posting.
---
Eve is played on reddit, as long as you are here you didn't win anything
---
but they required brain and ... ummm ... active gameplay .... that got switched to the resource collection instead ... where it can be afked more easy ...
---
Curious, blaster hull hecates?
---
I like the [Deleted] part of the letter. It really speaks to me. *Sniff*
---
&gt; we have supercarriers and titans at all.
---
I...
---
I actually agree with this. 
---
Turn titans into bridgers and leave em, remove supers entirely.
---
Game is now carriers, dreads, and titan bridge fleets.
---
Dig it.
---
I guess my point is that the other guy, even though he might play for the other team, by stepping up and leading a fleet is providing content. He’s made the same poor life choices by playing Eve we have plus he or she is leading other nerds and doing something. At the end of the day it’s just another weirdo at the other end of they screen. 
---
There’s a place for trash talk and all but keep it in perspective.
---
Why not a battleship?
---
too poor for a battleship :(, moa only cost 9 mill
---
good AAR thanks
---
The only thing I can say is if you've thought about the numbers this much that means you probably want maximum profit, in which case I'd say join a null block (I'm assuming you're in high sec)
---
Oh you mean "what can go wrong will go wrong"
---
Why would the attacking alliance's structures have anything to do with this?
---
The defending structure has a timezone set up. 
---
The attackers have an activity setting
---
The activity setting either modifies the structure's timezone, or extends it, or adds a new one according to some formula. 
---
Since the defenders do not control the activity setting, which is changeable, it will always move it in a direction favorable to the attackers.
---
I'm hoping most of test didn't take "the meteor" as seriously as this guy did. Like seriously, I've been shooting test ever since the end of the LAST tribute war, and I still have a cymek dino on my desk. Yes, I'm against the caps-online that eve has become, but I don't blame test for following what is clearly a winning concept now. That being said, every war needs its propaganda.
---
Was great fun, hope we see such a fight again in the near future.
---
&gt; That dude apparently went full cancer when he left goons 
---
A lot of older players leaving goons recently, corps and the alliance changed quite hard. And sadly not only in a positive direction
---
&gt;  We all know you would never use those capitals without the Imperium cap  fleet at least one mid away so don't pretend they put in any work. 
---
We all know supercap fights are - more or less - a numbers game, nobody puts supers into danger when a significantly bigger hostile fleet is in jump range. If I remember right goon supers did similar moves during wwb...
---
there were a lot of battleships tackled and stuck in bubbles, and probably plenty of people who dc'd or just fell asleep in their chair. goons did a good job extracting. it was also the right thing to NOT jump in our supers until it was already a decided win.
---
The key thing to know is that it is in fact a sandbox game.
---
There's a critical juncture when you're done with the tutorials and the career agents (the New Player Experience) at which you'll likely feel lost. The game stops telling you what to do next but you don't really know what you want to do next so you wander about fiddling about with the stuff you've learned: run some missions, mine some rocks, do a little exploration... but without a clear goal it feels a meaningless and it gets boring fast. It is at this point that a *lot* of players drop out and never come back and go on to fill discussion forums with comments about how boring EvE is.... if at any point in this boring wandering about aimlessly they get killed by another player they may add that the player base is "toxic".
---
This is why CCP spends so much time on features like "the Agency" and the ill-fated "Opportunities" etc. even though veteran players on this forum don't get anything out of them. But, CCP is trying to bridge that gap and get those lost and aimless players into doing *anything* so they stick around, start figuring out what they like, start setting goals around those activities and start to have fun again.
---
The best solution IMO is to join an active group that's doing stuff. A good group will provide a lot of motivation, direction, goals and further instruction which the game as a sandbox doesn't provide on it's own. They're invading some other space... they're working to build a new structure and corner a market... you can be part of that team effort and to pursue their goals you start to have goals yourself.. I want to get into this doctrine ship so I can be a bigger part of the next battle.
---
I say this as a mostly solo player myself... but I find even as a solo player being part of a group even when I'm mostly doing my own thing within the group is really helpful. It opens up a lot of content I otherwise wouldn't have access to and there's all sorts of good advice on how to achieve the next goal, deal with the next challenge etc.. and someone to have my back when that solo fight turns out to be bait for a small gang.
---
Whats a null block? Yes im in high sec, started a couple days ago, played eve before but never got very into it.
---
Nobody would merely say "Fuck goons", it is something you have to sing.
---
anyone has a video?
---
You can't compare travel time like that with the moa. It would still be faster in the venture because you could haul back your capacity of the hauler + your 5k from the venture, whereas with the moa you'd only have the hauler + the 200 or whatever m3 from the moa. (no reason not to use a mtu with the venture too)
---
Also you can't afk in the moa and you have to babysit it constantly
---
http://sov.space
---
Pick one
---
Unironicly one of the nicest dudes I know in sinners, he doesn’t talk shit on comms about goons or anything bitter ex ish
---
I would rather CCP not treat us like children and do something about the rampant botting. If they came out tomorrow and said, yeah we dropped the x bots that we thought were most likely mains into HS but banned 9000, I'd be happy. But they didn't. You know they didn't.
---
I dont even think this would be allowed on helldump. Unless it was a cute newbee told to post like that.
---
Which is super because OP’s screenshot is only showing 4.8 user. It feels like 800MB probably wasn’t the difference.
---
I wonder what else they tweaked.
---
Well I often asked myself why goons always form so late, the same situation occured during multiple keepstar fights. although they have to form 1000+ players into fleets and need to take gates that are known to be bubbled, goon fcs seem to think that forming 1.5 hours before such an important timer is enough
---
800 is a lot when you just crash without it lol
---
Jita is already on its own dedicated node IIRC.
---
Yeah but they don’t disappear either. They can sit in there forever? 
---
There are guys in my Corp who injected a ton of injectors during the winter thing and they still haven’t used all the SP yet, they’re waiting till they need it for something.
---
God dammit
---
You made me upvote a the initiative post
---
This is a copy / pasted message, but fell free to answer it if you have any questions.
---
First of all, take the time to do the career agent missions. It will show you many things in the game (exploration, mining, industry, hauling, etc).
---
Then, well Eve is a sandbox, so you will need to figure out what you want to do. As a new player, you are not strictly limited, but what ever you do, Eve can be dull and boring, mechanics are complex at first because of the amount of informations you need to learn but once you understand them it's generally a lot easier. What ever you want to do, try to have fun or enjoy the complex interactions mechanics are creating, so basically don't grind isk for the sake of grinding isk.
---
- Want to explore the stars alone ? Buy an exploration frigate, a cloaking device and go around the stars looking for data and relic sties. Maybe join a wormhole corp and enjoy space where frontiers change everyday, and need scanning on a daily basis. There are some newbie friendly wormhole corps that can teach you the way of Bob.
---
- Want to join one of the large nullsec empire ? Join TEST, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet or Brave. They are all well known newbie friendly corporation/alliance and they will give you free ships, a place in fleet, and people are generally willing to teach you. They also offer good opportunities for new players to make isk (exploration and salvaging mainly).
---
- Overwhelmed by large organizations but still want to join an active PvP corp ? Try and look for a small faction warfare corp or alliance, there are plenty of them and they will also guide you, get you a place in fleet and you will enjoy endless content.
---
- Want to settle in a bit more in "security" ? Run some combat mission in HS. But try not to do that, really.
---
- Want to become the space Rockefeller ? Look into market, region trading, and all the shit. You won't blow space ships but if you enjoy raw data, data analysis (like, real data analysis) this is your thing. Isk revenue is potentially infinite.
---
- Want to mine rocks and turn them into modules, ships, ammunition ? Start mining and industry. Pro tip, don't do it alone in HS you don't have a single chance, join Goons (= Karmafleet), nullsec have way more valuable ore and Goons are basically the safest most organized industry in the game. You can also join some renter corp but that's up to you.
---
- Want to build your own corp ? Build it with some friends, maybe to do industry, or PvE, or PvP. My 5 isk : FW is a really good way to make isk and have some fight for new players. Low class WH can also be interesting.
---
A short list of advice :
---
- [This is your bible](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)
---
- Right clic EVERYTHING.
---
- Eve is a sand box, figure out what you want to have fun doing and don't bother what other thinks. There is no right way to play Eve.
---
- Faction do not matter. Pick one you feels seems cool and then ignore it for ever since you can fly any ship of any faction without any difference.
---
- Eve is also a dangerous game. Don't use ships you can't afford to loose. Both players and NPCs can wreck you quite fast, even later in the game when you will fly big expensive ships.
---
- People will kill you. No matter where you are, people can and will kill you, even in high security space. HS is actually the worst place to be, because you think everyone is friendly when it's really not the case. Outside, it's a lot more easier, everyone is your enemy.
---
- The very same people that will kill you can also be the same people that will explain to you why you died if you ask them. People in the game are generally friendly and don't mind teaching new players.
---
- Don't get attached to your ships.
---
- Eve shine when played with other people. Don't be afraid of recruitment policies, knock at the door, join a corp, have fun with others.
---
- Learn of your mistakes, don't get angry. If you died, it's your fault.
---
- r/evenewbies it's a good place to ask stupid question. r/evejobs it's a good place to look for a corp.
---
Or not having a brain and knowing what else is going on in the rest of Eve.  Then again you are in Darkness so I know it's not required to have a brain let alone think independently.
---
Null block is a null Corp or Alliance. There are some good newbie ones! Check our Brave Newbies or Pandemic Horde; those are the common suggestions.
---
Hmm Yeah thats true, cant really afk.  Which is i guess is a greater amount of time then then the possibly 15% increase in speed.
---
mlyp
---
no no, init doesnt do that kind of pvp.
---
Null Blocs are the largest Alliances of Corporations.  Access to null sec means the most profitable ores and combat anoms (outside of WHs).  All of them have new player initiatives and will workwith you to make you better.  
---
Horde 
---
Goons
---
etc. 
---
Disclosure: I'm a hordie, you should join us!
---
Point them to the Unity Megacity demo, they did some very interesting things with Audio on a massive scale. Surely they could learn something useful from that, as it would apply to tens/hundreds of thousands of unique audio generating objects.

---
Right, I’m saying I’m very surprised that 800MB is the difference between crashing constantly and perfect stability. Because I’m almost certain it isn’t.
---
I wonder if there were some tweaks to attempt to keep memory &lt;4GB that were causing the crashes and removing those resolved it (and rewriting them to fix them may have had a similar impact).
---
Either way, very cool and good. Just curious from a computer science POV.
---
It's unintuitive because you think that highsec and anything leading from highsec to low, null or wh is gonna be safer. It's the complete opposite. People camp highsec connections just because it's an opportunity to kill new players who are easy prey. One of the most common mistakes new players make is get too attached to their ships. I myself lost a couple asteros with 200mil+ loot inside and it sucked, but it didn't suck so much that I wanted to quit. And that was because one player told me that exploration isk becomes yours only when you sell it. If it's in your cargo, it's not truly yours yet
---
Imagine having your whole campaign rest on the shoulders of a JFC who got laughed out of his last alliance after a tantrum.
---

---
Also its accurate, we will execute 1 newbro in a myrmidon every hour that our demands are not met. We want 72 female exotic dancers and 50b in salvage.
---
Unintutive? 
---
1 - Predators seek the "lowest hanging fruit" while hunting in nature and will even "camp" chokepoints and watering holes. You should expect the same or worse from humans, IME.
---
2 - Highsec has the largest number of players AND the lowest skilled players.
---
3 - Going from any k-space system through into a wild west/no local wormhole is always a risk
---
Add that all up and it is easy to intuit that highsec wormholes provide an easy way of ganking inexperienced players.
---
Welcome back to Eve! Wormhole space is best space!
---
Can't say I agree with playing with your food but as long as you eat it, it's OK. I presume CCP ate them too here.
---
Was worth a shot, haha
---
No, i meant you should try to skill to 5 mil then use it. As long as it can sit in your reclaimables without expiring, it will work.

---
I am very cautiously optimistic about this. My one big worry is that they will make multiboxing a real pain.
---
Welcome to There. It's a great place to be.
---
Oh i mean it's unintuitive because you don't expect to go from 1.0 to -1.0 security rating even if it is via a wormhole; and the fact that it is even more dangerous via high sec just adds the cherry on top.
---
I get the reasoning though. Cheers.
---
Blueballing your fleet, while smugging that you blue balled the enemy.
---
You know who you are.
---
I hope it works, it seems like it should.
---
Yeaaa those people are weirdos lol
---
I understand not caring about your profit but literally burning isk on RW is silly lol. I tried one site.. Miming missions are more interesting .
---
Ha! So your spy is in Karmafleet, what a shit station of a corp ;)
---
I'm just a second-grade goon, I don't own or even want a titan.
---
As soon as there's a logistics titan however I'll reconsider.
---
Eh?  Nothing in Mittani's tweets says we don't have bots.
---
&gt;GSF isn't even /on the chart/ 
---
Is factual.  Whatever botting bans we have are small enough in number that they don't put us on the chart.  Not that we don't have them.
---
&gt;There would be many reasons why you aren't on the list despite rampant botting
---
So, the only way you can arrive to your conclusion is to first assume that GSF is special in a way(s) that benefits us, rather than the obvious.  And not only benefits us enough just to tilt us out of the running barely if we were on the same scale, but tilt us so far that we get off the scale despite being tremendously fat + old.  
---
Cool + not disingenuous at all.
---
I will pm you, im kinda intrigued to know more
---
Whatever that audio is for the first 10 seconds made me straight up close the browser.

Thanks!
---
Errr. More like "Vain with a huge ego who was a mediocre FC and due to repeated fuckups was told he couldn't FC bigger things, who then tried to end-around the rules by starting his own squad, failed spectacularly, and then left the alliance in a huff to found his own elite PvP alliance under the delusion a bunch of people would quit with him and join him, and then when no one did, ran off to NC and lied his way into FCing for them."
---
Good luck with him NC. He certainly is worthy of you alliance.
---
Nice flair
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
Very happy with the 64 bit client. CCP you've done really well here..
---
We are glad u left also
---
Most bots run in VMs with a VPN. GUID means nothing.
---
bookmark https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/ because that will be your best friend for quickly finding info about anything in eve.

do the tutorial missions and the 'starter' missions - or at least the military ones - you get free ships and skills and you get a taste of what each career path is like
---
apply to eve university - i spent a year there when i first started and learned a lot, I still think about returning someday when I retire from life in nullsec
---
u/Jintaan, I feel like you could improve with having discussion about the answers you get after you questions. I could lead to a long video which is not necessarily the best for getting to know a candidate, but its make the interview a bit cold and generic.
---
Also lol at the "REE cloaky camping".
---
You must be new here.
---
&gt;thinking hardware bans can't be circumvented  
---
topkek
---
For horde they have daily moon mining ops. I have a newish character I send over in a covetor. They buyback the ore from you in system. Probably made around 250mm over the last week w that while doing stuff on other characters. 
---
Other blocs will have similar but I can’t speak to details.
---
youre probably not wrong, but this shit here was DadJokes level content, so you can imagine.  
---
Well...Its only going to get worse.
---
Oof
---
......
---
I think other markets have just started stagnating and people care less about stocking them, nearly everyone is using Jita now
---
I never shop anywhere except Jita unless it's something small and I can get it in Amarr, it's simply not worth it
---
violator fleet let's go
---
SP in your redemption queue does NOT count towards your total. Unassigned free SP on a character does count.
---
It was looked at as an option.  Mostly what we do now days are Purple fleets and didn't want to be separated.  Also, one side (either Reds or Blues) would be in Gal, which locks them out of Jita and Amarr trade hubs and gives crappy LP.  No one wanted the short end of the stick.
---
I do try and get the subjects to elaborate when I feel they're being vague, but thank you for the feedback - When it comes to CSM 15 I'll aim to do so, however I would be concerned about the possibility of anyone voting listening to all the interviews if they're 1h+ long!
---
Great fight, but I want to point out that the battle report is missing a lot of kills. I tried playing around with it but no luck.
---
It's been said here many of times but I'll reiterate. As its the most important lesson.
---
**You will lose ships often. Most likely you'll lose what you fit.**
---
However, do not despair, only fly what you can afford. Learn from each experience.
---
Seriously. Redline was always miserable to be around.
---
"the cloud" is not a catch all answer for server issues
---
you're stupid
---
I understand the issue and you can't make videos for everyone don't worry
---
not at this stage, no, probably in a couple weeks
---
dropping supers without subcap grid control is not wise, no matter how many you have
---
c. Lotsa dps. Bonus points to the nano BC fleet that warped to us at 0 and kept longrange ammo loaded. Nice welp guys, shame you had the 30 caracals to bail your asses out before we killed everyone
---
How about a compromise - remove excavators?
---
This post continues to not age well
---
my alts are out of control.
---
Well, by "cloud" I also implied modernizing the code and making it more scalable and able to be deployed over a larger amount of servers to handle the load, as well as take advantage of multithreading which IIRC eves server doesn't do.
---
Why wouldn't spreading the server over a cloud service that amazon or microsoft provides not be the answer here?  You would likely need more specialized hardware but its well within their purview, especially if its raw spike thoroughput.
---
C being yes?
---
&lt;3 - Got a Griffin Navy Issue video for tomorrow!
---
i too have replaced my ship already, and didnt want it to begin with.
---
Give me a griffin 1v1 FW fit and you will make me happy
---
With a little more experience in wh space you will grow used to the drastic security change and lack of local.
---
And its usually more dangerous in highsec connections because the k-space system is close to a trade hub. This way a group can catch highsec wh daytrippers AND wormholers that try to run logistics through to that trade hub.
---
Okay how do i start this... 
---
So basically... this was **NOT** the first "major battle" of the war. But I knew of course you would state this in your "I am so glad Im not in Goons anymore" post. I honestly had to read the first lines and was like "wow. another one who posts this bullshit".
---
To start this, please keep in mind that your Allymates arent really cool mathematicians. 
---
So NC. literally fucked up a lot when one of your "bros" started a post where he wanted to state that goons already lost the war when they started moving by subtracting the used fuel of our caps with some ships of dummies we lost in our homeland. I could tell you how you calculate whos the winner and the loser of a war but... this would take too long. So yea. Gege for that. 
---
You guys then of course summed up each and every kill of a super or other capital that has been burned in Delve while we were still deploying thousands of our capitals. But okay. The actual battlefield was Tribute but... hey why not counting Delve in. Sure. If Caps still rat while have to be deployed at the same time, maybe they deserve it. 
---
But what you guys also forgot up to this day was the pretty little fact that while we deployed, you guys deployed in Delve (oh wonder). The Hide and Seek Tactics that Goons had to do while WWB was good for you now because if you were in some Eagles and faced a thousand Titans, sure you wouldnt survive. You dont even have to calculate chances. Okay. Fair enough. 
---
But now you are playing kind of a joker by coming up with telling the people that you have won the first true fight of the war ? Jesus I dont know if i should laugh of cry because this is too dumb and so wrong!
---
First point: The first real fight where you guys **ACTUALLY** undocked was this 1000 guy-fight: 
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI3FlmO2XhE&amp;t=](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI3FlmO2XhE&amp;t=)  
---
We had a real fair fight. You guys lost some good billions of Commandships, T3C, Command Destroyers, HACs and logi, we also lost a good ammount of shippies in return. Though in the end you guys warped off leaving your structure undefended. We got the timer. Im not even trashtalking in this because the fight was great.

---
Second point:
---
In the folliwing days you didnt really show up for "major fights". But well... 
---
3 days after it:  [https://zkillboard.com/related/30000863/201905270000/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30000863/201905270000/)

---
Some small fights happened.We were pretty glad because we had the chance to hit f1, so did you. But on reddit, none of you guys wrote about it. Why should you. 
---
*We even gave you a 70%-fleet of 180 Feroxes to your primezone without any capitals in our backs, but guess what: you didnt show up. Do you see any shitpost on reddit about that situation? I dont think so. Correct me if Im wrong.* 
---
Third: Your system was cynojammed yesterday so unfooooortunately our caps couldnt drop on you guys.  I can see the shame in your eyes and yes it must be really dishonorably for you to not have picked a fair fight. Such a shame.  Im sure you would have wanted this fight with all our capitals lul. And of couuurse you would have undocked to it. No doubts. ... lol 
---
**The only thing I wanna tell you with this is:  Just... dont tell people facts that you have cut from your Excel sheet of links for possible bicepsflex on reddit. There were big fights in the last weeks. And there were smaller ones. And we won most of them. So no, the Goon is not a superhero with 100m ehp in his pod so yes Goons can also die in a battle! Dont try pointing out how stupid Goons are when in return you guys dont show up for nice fights thus leaving a chance to show what you are REALLY capable of. It's just not cool at all. Please downvote this if you are unsatisfied with my pov. I do not care at all. All i want is that this lying on reddit stops. Im really tired of it.**
---
What does the download everything option do there? Also is there a link for what all those various options do?
---
and don't forget to go whale watching
---
yeah ,well, he was good enough for this fight wasn't he.  
---
FFS you gonna release a documentary about following ghandi to the ocean?
---
Better, ccp won't remove stuff though. So working towarda a nerf or rework is our best bet
---
Robbed!!
---
Just started out and was wondering what faction it would be best to start out as for solo / small gang PvP. I bought Omega now so i can cross spec, but if i were to go Alpha for a while for any reason in the future i want to have good Frigs to Cruiser sized ships available. 
---
Im also wondering if its better to join a FW NPC Corp, FW Player Corp or a WH Corp to get into solo / small gang PvP.
---
I won't beta it since I don't really have any problems right now, but once I get firmly into the game I may need it. So thank you to the Beta testers, bravely going where few others have gone.
---
Are you looking to mine for Isk or to just build? As an alpha one thing many overlook is gas huffing in a WH. You can do so in a cheap venture fit and can pull much more isk/m3 in most situations compared to hi sec ore. 
---
Take a look at joining a WH Corp and see all that Wh space has to offer. In my opinion it can be more fun and intimate instead of joining a huge Corp in one of the Null blocs.

&gt; Eh? Nothing in Mittani's tweets says we don't have bots.
---
&gt; For years, my people have been accused of botting, harboring bots, cheating, and worse in #eveonline. Today evidence was revealed by @CCP_Peligro despite being the largest alliance in the game and in the gaming industry as a whole, GSF isn't even /on the chart/. #tweetfleet
---
I'll not play this game with where the random Goon reddittor spins things being said to his space cult's benefit whenever it suits him friend. I don't have time for that anymore. The only possible connection between the accusasions and the chart is that the chart falsifies the accusations.
---
&gt; So, the only way you can arrive to your conclusion is to first assume that GSF is special in a way(s) that benefits us, rather than the obvious. And not only benefits us enough just to tilt us out of the running barely if we were on the same scale, but tilt us so far that we get off the scale despite being tremendously fat + old.
---
What you just wrote is incomprehensible. The way I arrive at my conclusion is by undocking in your space. I suggest the same for you. I'm just saying that the chart doesn't falsify the conclusion.

In what way?
---
When i try to....consolidate assets....i am often left with a bunch of crap in random places that isnt worth moving.  use a char with remote selling to visit each area and sell off the stuff.  usually you can get a significant price markup over jita, just rather unpredictable at what rate it will sell.  lowsec even better rates than high.  npc null, alas, actually not so well.

but ya, people will pay 10,000 per liquid ozone rather than fly 25 jumps to get some at the normal price.  cyno stuff in particular moves at high margins.

---
Reading stuff like this actually makes me wanna play again ):
---
&gt;I'm not sure that putting entosis ahead of structure timers is necessarily good for the content that people would like to see
---
Granted, I am in TEST, but I think entosis is a pretty well balanced system now. Once they fixed the shitty entosis mechanics and enabled remote reps, it became much more of the intent: a contest of fleet combat for control of the field(s), without the burden of structure grinds. Split fleets across the constellation are also very fun, but Im not sure how much I would change that mechanic. 
---
Structure timers and entosis fights are two different challenges, and I think both have their place in a full scale war.
---

Hey friend i do not know ! Keep on going too ! I will also be there i hope we will come across and have a fun time.

As a Mac user, the new client has been amazing. I realize this could be partially 64-bit and partially the changes made to Wine at the same time, but whatever it is, it’s been running flawlessly for me and with huge performance improvements over the old client, and my computer is pretty long in the tooth. Thank you CCP for not only not leaving Mac users behind, but giving us a better experience!
---
(And the launcher crashes every time I try to quit it and I have to force quit, but, like, who cares, I’m trying to quit it anyway)
---
I thought you meant like spanish lol
---
Just don't bring anything bigger than a battlecruiser if you don't want to get dropped.

Part of the reason many of us left calmil back in '16 was due to galmil having snuff on standby

---
I really couldn't care less who these people are this is a step in the right direction well done #CCP
---
Just logged back in for the first time in a literal ice age and holy crap does this game look prettier then it did years ago. Bit shocked. 
---
So my first noob question is my laptop sucks. Until I get an upgrade I still want to play and keep things relatively smooth. What graphical settings would you guys recommend lowering in order of priority? 
---
Tossing shadows off helped a ton in smoothing my frame rate out but I would like to tinker some more.
---
Yes please and thank you.
---
I prefer the Mike Tyson version : "Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth."
---
My point is that everything you just said is completely unrelated to them publicly executing a couple botters, but people present it as a dichotomy where we either get public executions OR we get CCP to solve the issue. It's the good old "you are chasing me for speeding when there's drug dealers and rapists on the streets" bullshit.
---
"in case a cyno jammer went down" isn't a thing in eve.
---
I started doing that last week and it generates a ton of isk by comparison. Plus, so much more fun.
---
If you can hold off from using it. Or needing it. Then yes, you should just keep it in redemption queue until you reach 5m SP. And it will give you 5.75m SP after taking it. But it might be more fun to have some SP now to train some skills up you have been waiting on.
---
Hey i didnt ping about the stupid ihub mine was for the 1900 fleet check yourself before you wreck yourself
---
If you're sub 1 mill SP (and you haven't spent money on omega), consider ditching this char for a new one. I only say this because new characters start with a LOT of basic skills that characters from 2009 just don't have, about 400k. And the new player recruitment links give an additional 750k. I'm sure anyone in this sub (myself includded) would be happy to pm you a rec link.
---
Only bot users would have a use for such data.
---
The warzone always flips.
---
Join the “Join Horde” channel in game, that’s our public recruitment channel and if you ask questions there you’ll probably get better and quicker responses than from a Reddit conversation. 
---
I don’t know the name of Brave’s public channel, but if you search for the Corp “Brave Newbies” they should have a link to it in their description. 
---
These are the two newbro friendly nullsec corps that I’d most recommend, although there are quite a few more that I know of, but I can’t confirm that those ones are actually good.
---
Honestly if you are looking for straight max performance turn off all effects, disable sound, and put all graphical settings on the lowest setting possible. It'll make your game look like a potato but it will be responsive.
---
I remember fighting you guys back in 15, before the citadel fuckery and snuff dropping every fight
---
FeelsBadMan those times are gone
---
Don't say that... It's so tempting haha
---
goons outnumber by about 2-300.... calls it an unfair fight, lmao.
---
Have you seen his solo damavik? Thing is nuts
---
 You do realize they said I'm talking and stationed  t delve would not be secure as normal they said that like a week ago they moved the whole Capital Fleet North but all the main assets they will have secure they will have stuff on back up don't be stupid come on guys delve as well secure don't think the man stuff is well protected if you see a lot of jump Freighters coming north they're moving in up north but right now I don't see that you're not looking at the logistics correctly don't be stupid
---
I have no idea why exactly, but it's so much easier to find fights in Black Rise now that we're in Caldari FW.  Also, waaaay less cap drops on our small gangs.  Since RvB is a "train by doing" organization with limited SRP, our newbros are enjoying the T5 LP while waiting for content to come to us.  We also routinely get new recruits from militias, get them into fleets, hook them up with a new ship if they need it, etc.   In all, it's a surprisingly good fit for RvB and working out better than anyone imagined.    
---
But mostly we're just always getting fights when we roam BR which is great.

Re: Cloaky camping
---
&gt; People should be at the keyboard to have an effect in the game.
---
People create effects in the game when not logged in all the time. E.g. if I moved a titan force greater than TEST's in Esoteria right now, you'd stop Rorqual mining and possibly capital ratting, if not an evacuation (see NC). The effect is very similar to cloaky campers. Not the actuality of someone being at the keyboard, but the possibility of getting tackled/die that makes you dock.
---
You as a nullsec dweller have intel networks, supercap umbrella, fatigue free jump gates, cyno beacons, spy networks, instantly updating local, and more. Does it really bother you that much for attackers to have at least some mechanics in their favor? You defended that the attacking side in sov warfare have their options very limited. Why does the same logic not apply when these are attackers in daily whaling, instead of sov warfare? 
---
All in all, I hope other TEST candidates have different mentalities from the classic "null bloc candidate", that respects different playstyles.
---
Thanks for info
---
Honestly, the web bonus is pretty strong even on a shitty rookie ship lol
---
Faction doesn't matter anyone even with alpha. You will retain your ability to use the alpha skills (including other races) when you lose omega status.
---
Enjoy your dead game
---
Fly around npc nullsec and ask in local. If you’re looking for a small alliance then even a good one probably won’t be well known on Reddit. 
---
Just be willing to hop around a bit, because obviously people in a Corp will tell you it’s good even if it really isn’t, either because they’ve never been in a good Corp or they are profiting off the taxes.

Provi does small fights.  But no one is interested in being the recipient of helldunks, so that really should be a rarer thing than it is.
---
Yep. Initially you’ll be fighting against fast tackle and whatever else happens to be nearby. After a few minutes you’re fighting against everyone in standing fleet who wants killmails.
---
I remember Redline on him fcing his ares swordfleets and me tying to kill them on my abaddon, so why is he not a goon now?

And is that why we see no more swordfleets in Horde space?

Wish I was there when that happened. I love that CCP moves bots to hisec like this so we can kill them
---
&gt; Why wouldn't spreading the server over a cloud service that amazon or microsoft provides not be the answer here?
---
because the way ccp server code is written, all events in one system need to take place on one discrete piece of server hardware. without a complete overhaul of the codebase, there is zero way that moving eve to "the cloud" even works at all, let alone helps
---
welcome to /r/eve. take note: everyone here hates how the servers work. nothing can be done.
---
Red pulses are people jumping their capital in, blue, green and yellow pulses are fleet boosting effects (like buffs in WoW), and the rest is will... magic.

I highly recommend you make the swap now. It will dramatically improve your client performance anywhere near thousands of ships and keep you from crashing due to memory issues.

Hey, Welcome to Eve!

As others have said, Eve is incredibly immense and immersive; don’t expect to “get it” right away.

Take your time to know the UI, do the tutorials, and take some time to look forward in what you want to do in Eve.

If you want some help, I know Dreddit in TEST has a mentorship program where you get paired with someone that has played the game for a bit, access to great space, and lots of opportunity to grow and find your place in Eve. Check out dredditisrecruiting.com for more info. :)

"Don't fly what you cant afford to lose" is supposed to prevent a 2 week old character from training straight into a battleship with no support skills, dying in a fire and quitting the game saying it's impossible to catch up.    
---
When they should be starting small with a dozen disposable t1 frigates and working their way up the ship tree. Along the way they learn better ways of earning income, have better skills and game knowledge and can afford better ships.    
---
But of course you also have the unintended consequence of new players thinking that all PvP requires billions to start and billions to maintain and they never get off the ground.

Well that's not what Black Rise says, we undock and we get fights.
---
Yes T5 is incentive but hey if we do it right and keep standings across the board. We can switch sides etc we just wanna have good fights. Kill and be killed just the way I like it.
---
We like the option to have access to jita so that means the choice of caldari or amarr. Seeing most pilots fly in black rise anyway the choice was made for us.
---
Damn.  So I have to actually be at my computer and take my freighter through the invasion zone with a web alt.  Usually I just keep the cargo value below 1b, the ship insured, and the route relatively safe, and I autopilot.
---
People just want free stuff. No one bitched when they got a million sp for free.
---
they literally cant be circumvented unless you buy new hardware...
---
Its stable. Very stable. Much more stable than 32 bit. I have only seen performance gains not losses.
---
It's very randomized from what I've seen.
---
Download everything downloads all models and textures (all game files) so nothing has to be live downloaded from servers.
---
Logging is for debug
---
DX9 is old graphics card compatability
---
minimise to tray on close means the eve launcher won't ever close, but just minimmize to the taskbar tray (the little icons by the clock)
---
Ignore certification errors is for when CCP breaks shit, it allows them to fix it/debug tool.
---
Use system config for proxy is only relevant if you use a proxy.
---
high DPI scaling changes the game so it looks more approrpriately sized for high dpi monitors
---
Enable hardware rendering, if disabled, means that the launcher will use more CPU and less GPU power.
---
Thread count for resource download - downloads can use multipule threads to increase maximum speed. However, this can make low lantency games and shit get fucked (ping spikes) due to overloading cheaper routers.
---
I care let he bots die. In fire.
---
I noticed that the 64-bit version of the launcher was eatting away at my CPU. More than the actual client.
---
Thanks for that! Very useful

That isn’t really true at all. It will swap to disk, not crash. We’re talking trivial values. I suspect it was some bad GC implementation that they just tuned way down on the 64 client.

---
haha n1 video bud and cool play. Sad you didnt made it., was kind a shaking with you when you bumped on the first capital. Not gona troll that Avatar right next to you with that purple skin was maybe me :)   
---
i would have dropped you a travel inti :(
---
the launcher has no 64bit version. its always 32bit
---
This battle report is a bit closer to what happened. Both sides took some hefty losses. Goons made mistakes and panfam was there, in greater numbers, with better fleet comp, and more organization then anyone had counted on. Impressive. 
---
If you change start time by an hour, you can add another 10b to goons losses.

Also of note is that [fleetcom.space](https://fleetcom.space) is more accurate then [br.inyour.space](https://br.inyour.space)

3d mouse allows for shifting multiple axis at one time including up down left right side to side and rotation of the camera. Its significant for the tactical camera as you can get the smooth feel of flying around untethered to a ship
---
This isn't actually useful to us, unless you're trying to jump to uneducated conclusions on their process, or developing your own botting tools.
---
Ok clearly you don't create or use the br tool outside of clicking on the ones you see in Reddit posts because [br.inyour.space](https://br.inyour.space) is really shit and breaks all the time.
---
This is correct.
---
If you want to be a fucking solid fleet bro fly a command ship on one account and logi or mainline dps on another.
---
I practiced with Command Destroyers and T3D fleets first then onto Command ships and HAC/BS fleets, it's pretty easy as the command ship just shoots tackle if it gets close and boosts. trickiest part is probably watching for yellowbox on 2 clients but that's not too hard.
---
Fleets are always in need of boosts, FC's usually want backup boosts also so theres usually plenty of need for lvl5 boosters with implant.
---
I've seen people try this sort of thing... hey, Eve thrives in part because the sandbox allows weird ideas to be tried, and that is fun.
---
Some suggestions:
---
Only 2 processor rigs will fit (calibration costs), maybe need 2 co-processor IIs.
---
Spend that 3rd rig slot maybe Core Defense Extender.
---
Put some basic shield tank on it to make it slightly less attractive for roving gankers. A limited adaptive, a medium regolith, maybe even a eutectic cap recharger. Then you have room for a 10mn Y-s8 AB, a survey scanner II if you really want to micromanage your mining for "peak" alpha clone efficiency.
---
I would suggest some combat drones, because having to warp off due to random rats really dents the isk/hr.
---
they are both the same launcher ^^
---
I use it all the time.  It works better than the garbage one above because it is actually readable.
---
Even if they get elected, still good to know if they are hroseshit or if they have decent ideas. So far of all the 3 interviewed I listened, almost all are either horseshit or decent with some shit ideas.
---
Where's the "Doing CCP's job for them!" crowd now?
---
Feedline
---
Again if you use br.inyour.space, you know it often misses shit and it often freezes and crashes. 
---
Also the tool that included in this post is readable, you just don't like change. It scares you...
---
Living in a wormhole because “delete local” but always feeling like someone’s watching you because there’s no local.

botting isn't an automatic permaban always which it should be :|
---
Yeah do it. Eve uni is a decent group, and yeah, rule 1 is people are gonna want to shoot you, no space is safe.
---
If I'm going to be honest part of the reason I wanted to do this was for my own personal desire to get an idea of what the people who'd be getting on the CSM would be like as CSM members.
---
Equally however, it'd be colossally unfair if I *only* interviewed people who weren't on ballots, and most of them would dissappear into irrelevancy until the next election anyway as the majority of candidates have effectively 0% chance of being elected.
---
This. It's there to prevent me from welping entire fleets of fuckin marauders and shit.

Many / most botters use virtual machines.

The only GUID in a system these days is for Windows registration, and you don't even need that to use Windows 10.

I use such a setup at the office, since I'm a Linux user, and have to deal with odd format CAD and document files.

yepp specialy in a largescalefight. When you Cant drop all, do not drop at all sometimes.

Unless you think CCP has been secretly spending all our skill-injector nuPLEX money on training a cadre of super ninjas to sneak into our houses in the middle of the night to read the serial numbers directly off the CPU--
---
(CCPlease: This is the only acceptable excuse for not spending it on further EVE development.)
---
-- then there's no way for them to know anything about your hardware with any degree of certainty.

Open the above br on mobile please.

Having come back recently from last playing in 09, The Agency window is what I needed.
---
Now that I'm older I want more market data. The details window could use a lot more info, or even embed the compare tool into it. I don't have enough screen space for all my windows lol.
---
There use to be two coalitions, Panfam and Goons, perfectly splitting the map. And not like now where there’s a bunch of coalitions that will work with Panfam or Goons in the event of war, just straight up Panfam on one side and Goons on the other. This mythical time you speak of didn’t exist because it was happening right up until the moment Phoebe and Aegis came out, and didn’t fully finish degrading till a couple years ago.
---
i have no gpu for any practical purposes atm and setting present interval to interval three is literally what keeps me in the game
---
that aside, shader quality is the most demanding factor (not shadows). high is 2019, medium is 2014 and low dates back to the first potatoes grown in history.
---
Why would any large game that has been around for years be any different from eve re: Frankenstein code? Do the wow devs do regular rewrites to all new back end code to eliminate dev decisions years ago that were poor choices in hindsight?
---
Yea, will definitely need some time to reacclimate before fielding all that, but I do like the supporting role a lot
---
the supers just cleaned up in the last 5 minutes.
---
"What are resource wars?", Alex!
---
I think it could have been a hit if it wasn't co-operative mode only.
---
If you select the rat and hit "f" will it auto lock then attack, or do you need to lock target first?
---
This answered a lot of questions I had all at once. Thanks.
---
Enjoy the beach while you can.
---
If you get into this game properly, that may be the last time you venture outdoors for a while.
---
Quick someone post Steel Roamer Hell Week
---
Wait till you hear about boosts and rorq compression. Mind blown.
---
You're so out of touch with reality CCP should hire you as CEO.
---
Why does this shit not happen when I'm off work and at home? Kinda jewish CCP.
---
We've got to even the odds somehow :P
---
I've been trying to find something like what you are talking about. It's just not out there. 
---
But that's a good thing. I feel WAY more involved having to do all of my own research and analytics on the market. Still don't understand half of it but that's been half the fun.
---
Think like a space capitalist. Fresh to the system, unfamiliar with the universe.  What do people need? where are the commerce hubs? Do you want to produce? Or courier? Think FEDEX, they don't make anything but the are a global shipping company. The game has a serious economy and needs to be handled that way. It's hard, but soooooo worth it! 
---
I could ramble on more and more but at work right now. Oh my excel skills have also been on the rise since I've started playing, which actually benefits into my RL job. So there is another thought for ya!
---
I've had dc's too, for the first time in fact, right after the main update. Also the laggy hack window.
---
No dc's yesterday though so it might have been fixed.
---
I guess Scarebear/Whelp FC  = Strat FC in NCdot.
---
While 32 bit gives 4GB, you can only have 3GB of user space memory as the kernel uses the remainder for its address space (which can't be mapped in and out). Citation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/gettingstarted/virtual-address-spaces
---
That means 3GB to 4.8 which is over a 50% increase.
---
Then there was that carrier that decided it could gate around delve with space superiority fighters and fight harpies.
---
"Carving your own part of space" is basically impossible to do so from the start. Play the game, join a corp, figure out stuff, have fun.
---
Burning real money on a make-believe  world might be considered silly too tbf.
---
Oh, but hey.. at least the Ragnarok has that blue POS! &gt;:(
---
where was this interview?
---
What are the generic playstyle chat channels these days? I know communities always had chat channels but after being gone for 3 years most of mine look dead.
---
Raw footage here: [https://youtu.be/BRyQe-VKP6U?t=1324](https://youtu.be/BRyQe-VKP6U?t=1324)
---
Easiest/quickest way: Join one of the mega-corps in the big alliances.
---
May or may not be satisfying depending on what you find in that corp/alliance during your TZ.
---
If you don't know what you want in a corp, this can be a handy tool for figuring out your personal must-haves and must-not-haves.
---
Beyond that, there's the usual recruitment platforms on here, the official forums, and in-game channels.
---
3.2 not 3 but yes, point still remains.
---
my wallet suddenly feels lighter
---
More useless theater that wastes dev time (that they obviously don't have enough of to actually deal with the problem) instead of spending that time...well, actually dealing with the problem.  I guess the PR side is working though, since there are still idiots praising them for the showmanship.
---
I mean buying plex for isk is silly lol
---
Oh the days of battleship mining those were the good days of hunting
---
He did just fine here for this fight, but that might say more about Goons.
---
First relevant win for NC after 2 weeks of war activities. At this rate you guys might still have 1 or 2 structures in tribute after we're done! Well played!
---
CCP:  New player retention is almost 0%
---
Also CCP:  Lets spawn OP NPCs in new player systems that will kill day 1 players on stations and in their mission pockets when they have no way to fight back!
---
\*CCP logic\*
---
There should be a defense mode where they attack anything attacking you (not aggroed).
---
Hell, I once got myself into a superfast claw and made a set of random off-grid instas between 1000km and 10000km away for this reason.
---
Figured it out!
---
I had Hardware Rendering enabled, and it was saved in Window's Registry, so no matter how many files i removed, it always tried to launch the Launcher with it enabled.
---
I've sent in a bug report for this.
---
So if you have the same issue:
---
1. Open regedit.exe
---
2. go to Computer\\HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Software\\CCP\\EVE
---
3. Edit "LauncherEnableHardwareRendering" from "true" to "false".
---
4. Launch the Launcher and it should work again.
---
Ya, I logged on this morning...oh well, it is what it is.
---
as a rock?
---
Kinda like Drifter incursions.  Also  probably kind of like Triglavian invasions unless the next stages are way better than this shit we've got now.
---
I mean, the gameplay is literally no different than just mining a random rock in space, except mining the rock gives you profits.  Why you'd do the same activity for no profits and consider it "fun" may be a sign of actual insanity.
---
I carrier and a ferox fleet, how will be recover
---
At work ... unaffected.
---
I do want to see the first episode people asking dumb questions of other pilots. This would be the ONE show where that kind of exposition would fit the verse.
---
I'm not particularly impressed with them, they should be what all Minmatar ships look like by default (they kinda did before the shader  "updates"), not something I have to dump an assload of PLEX for.
---
clever...
---
It's a game..... shouldn't everything you do be for fun?
---
You act like they aren't doing this as a show of appeasement, and they are actually doing things about the bots. Hell, the last time they did this, THEY DID NOT EVEN BAN THE BOTS EXECUTED.
---
Your comparison to the speeding driver only holds if the cops are actually doing something about the drug dealers and rapists. If there's a rape occuring next to your car while another gang member partner shoots at pedestrians alongside your car, and they are STILL writing you a ticket at that very moment, yes, those cops are in the wrong.
---
Might this be the wholesomest comment of the war?
---
Imagine waking up at night seeing [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1105096804159447041/Kj6RgQqd_400x400.png)

&gt;is eve overwhelming
---
no, just niche.
---
Someone should totally do an all noobfleet public gank and roam.
---
I love my min hulls, but of all the awesomeness, why brag the nag looks? it so fugly. guess it could be worse, could be a phoenix model xD
---
How do you *realistically* live your every-day life when you have the potential to be a US senator, a Congolese warlord or a Russian porn star?
---
Just... live. Calm down bro.
---
I'm so confused
---
you got inspired to have fun and do something interesting but that was scary so now you want to uninstall?
---
Do they though? They didn't last time.
---
Buy it and spend the extra 400 you said you're willing to on a new mobo/CPU and some ram. You'll be fine. I run 4 clients on a 970 and it works great.
---
Also, as important as insta-undock bookmarks are, insta-dock bookmarks are equally as useful. Warping to a station at 0 doesn't always mean you'll land at 0 exactly. With the default warp to 0, you'll often land between 0m and 2km. Having a bookmark that will always put you guaranteed inside of the docking radius is essential, because if you land a slow hauler at 2km you have to accelerate from a dead stop to burn the remaining distance to reach docking radius, which are crucial seconds where you might get popped/bumped, etc.
---
As well, don't just have one insta-undock bookmark. Make several at varying lengths. Fit yourself up a really fast frigate, like a Claw with MWD and overdrive injectors, undock and turn on your MWD. Let it run until the station disappears off grid (you can't select "look at" on it anymore) and start dropping bookmarks every 300-700km until you have a small selection of them; like 5-ish. That way if the gankers use their own bookmarks or if they use scan probes to find where you last insta-undocked to in order to wait for you to do it again, you can just pick among those bookmarks randomly each time you leave the station so you're unpredictable.
---
And all those galmil groups that worked with snuff left galmil already lol
---
Nah. It's even funnier when the 'extinction' didn't actually happen, despite the rhetoric.
---
*he has commitment issues*.
---
&gt;Is it really easy to get lost with this game? How do you *realistically* play a game with this kind of scope of possibilities and time requirements?
---
You take your time. Eve is a long-term game of patience. This way you don't get overwhelmed.
---
There are many valuable life lessons to be learned in playing eve. This is one of them.
---
That's my goal being your cheerleader over here.
---
I’m not sure the blame rests squarely on the playerbase, although of course we’re not blameless either. 
---
Citadels and Fozzie sov encourage the boredom tactics. Tidi exacerbates it even though it’s beneficial to the extent that it at least allows things to mostly function. 
---
Short of a gentleman’s agreement to duke it out with battleships or honor brawl and only bring one fleet, you’ll always find people min/maxing to try and be as effective as possible while denying the other person.  That’s human nature and it’ll never change.  Even in those honor brawl situations someone will inevitably violate it to win. 
---
My point is that CCP seems blind and deaf to our pleas about the game’s mechanics and how unfun things are. If they actually tried to make these mechanics fun to fight over, players would do it. 
---
If Fozzie sov wasn’t winnable by spamming ecm griffins and brick tanked battlecruises, players would have to come up with better solutions. 
---
If Citadels weren’t cheap and able to be anchored infinitely, players would have to come up with better solutions. 
---
If scarcity actually existed, people wouldn’t be inclined to take the easy solution and hole up in a super profitable and safe and efficient region.
---
I don’t think we can wholly blame players for trying to gain every edge they can in a game that has been competitive from the beginning.
---
Wrong there is about a 30km radius safe space if you online a large pos for about three days if it gets attacked.
---
I was uh... being sarcastic, in case that’s not entirely clear.
---
Instead of a moa try it with a gnosis. I believe it has more cargo space.
---
Mine are similar except I use 1-5, Q-T and A-G, and then I use Z for drone attack, and then the modifier keys to launch and recall drones. It frees up X, C, V and B to use for the navigation keys so you can align, orbit etc without much hand movement. 
---
Shift+key for heat, and ctrl+shift+1, Q and A to overheat the row.
---
They still have me :)
---
And I'm glad to have them to shoot at too.
---
Oh yeah, its hilarious in retrospect given how bad that campaign fell apart. 
---
I just mean I hope most test members didn't take it as personally as it seems some of them did. vOv
---
Dude, we have no idea and are wondering WTF right beside you, so don't ask us. Only ccp knows.
---
He came on with his alts when everyone else was asleep, the ceo and a few others got on and killed off the little fleet after a while.
---
Join an NPSI group, like Spectre Fleet, and do whatever the fuck you want to bud!
---
still n1 at least you tried :) i will stash a travel inti in my dreads from now on :) maybe you are lucky next time. And to be fair i never thought about what you just did... iam a bit hyped :D
---
&gt;You act like they aren't doing this as a show of appeasement, and they are actually doing things about the bots.
---
Two separate things, they are not connected. It is appeasement, but what I am repeating for the third time is that they are not connected.
---
&gt;Your comparison to the speeding driver only holds if the cops are actually doing something about the drug dealers and rapists.
---
It holds either way because nobody would ever say that the drug dealers and rapists were not caught because the police caught a speeding guy. Those two things are not related.
---
&gt;If there's a rape occuring next to your car while another gang member partner shoots at pedestrians alongside your car, and they are STILL writing you a ticket at that very moment, yes, those cops are in the wrong.
---
So CCP found 2 bots and were like "we can punish both, or only one and make a public display out of it"???
---
Nope. The Eisenhower quote is better.
---
NC will have to undock more often to get fights.
---
It was before that. It was horrendously brutal. Most of my net worth at the time.
---
I wish I was there for that
---
I don't know but you guys sure made a big deal about melting half a mega fleet a few days ago so I figured a fleet loss must be meaningful to your side.
---
Go for the Venture.  100%.  There's no contest because the Moa 100% isn't gonna work for one key reason that everyone else seems overlooked.
---
Cargo space.
---
The Moa has a 450m3 cargo bay.  If you fit 1x Expanded Cargohold II in your last remaining low-slot, you'll be able to increase that to 573.5m3.  It will take you 1m20s to fill your cargo.  At this point, you will have to jettison your cargo into a can, which will swiftly be scooped up by your MTU.
---
Then, 1m20s later, you'll fill your cargo again and you will have to jettison your cargo into a second can.  But you can't.  Because you can only jettison cargo once every 3 minutes.  So you can only mine for 1m20s every 3 minutes.
---
Well no.  That's a lie.  There is a way around it and that is to roll up with a hauler, anchor an MTU, anchor a Giant Secure Container, empty your cargo into the GSC, then jettison your cargo and quickly transfer the contents of the GSC into the can before the MTU drags it out of range.  But if you have to move position because there are no longer any decent asteroids within range, you'll have to turn up again with the hauler and move the GSC because you can't move more than 2.5km away from the GSC.
---
So stick with the Venture, find a public mining fleet and let them do the hauling for you, or move out to Null-Sec and join up with Pandemic Horde or Goons or TEST or something, where they will run regular mining fleets, with fleet boosts to increase your mining laser range and mining yield, and sometimes deal with hauling for you, and you'll be mining much more valuable ore than you'll get in high-sec, and they'll buy it off you at a good price too.
---
I just tried it last night on my 6 year old i5-4670k with 16GB ram and 1060 3GB GPU. WOW! 
---
I always wondered why youtuber's videos were so smooth and my client never felt that way, even when single boxing. I thought maybe it was just people running 4K monitors or higher refresh rates. But now with 64 bit client, it's silly smooth and the frame rates just don't drop. Great job, CCP. Thanks!
---
A cruiser has no storage... its like 0.5 cycle and your cargo hold is full. Very inneficient.
---
This.  The lack of direction is the 2nd toughest thing.
---
The toughest is to learn ships are like ammo.  You don't wanna waste them, but they are going to explode at some point.  The faster one accepts it, the better off you will be.
---
Also, if solo is your jam, find a chat channel with a variety of players.  I joined Pro Synergy when I started and had access to players in every corner of EvE.  Could ask anything and someone was able to respond in a meaningful way, and not just "Google it nub."
---
I left Karma because my buddies were in Shadow State and they're the best corp in Goonswarm.
---
And the Mystery Code, COSMOS missions, faction storylines, Walking in Stations, pirate faction ship lines...
---
Yes and no.  Find what it is you want to do then find a corp that does that stuff, join, and learn.  If you want to pvp then there is no point in reinventing the wheel.  Learn about fits and how to move on grid and fleet mechanics from folks that have been doing it a long time.  Think of it like going to college to learn a major.  Running a corp even a small one can become a job.  Why not get the experience from those already doing that job :)
---
This is always a fun show, but I don't really want to see 20 guys get a public execution, I want to see the 2000 get banned, and mechanics changed so (i) they can't just go inject a new alpha on a VM tomorrow, and (ii) anomaly ratting is more engaging and harder to bot.
---
https://youtu.be/eviWPvZn2Go just skip to 2:50 of this video, a guy says "Man, some of those dreads were blingy" and then imagine me screaming into comms, "I just stole a sabre from a dread wreck!" and then frantically trying to get it out of there. Lmao.
---
What is the status of FW??
---
I looks like the mims are getting pasted.
---
1DQ next
---
&gt; Since RvB is a "train by doing" organization with limited SRP, our newbros are enjoying the T5 LP while waiting for content to come to us. We also routinely get new recruits from militias, get them into fleets, hook them up with a new ship if they need it, etc. In all, it's a surprisingly good fit for RvB and working out better than anyone imagined.
---
I'm not un-baised but I've always thought CCP should steer new players towards faction warfare if they're not already in a well established player corporation. So many new players quit once they're done with the NPE because the sandbox is just too open ended but they don't have any idea what they really want to do next. FW is an ideal middle ground to ease those lost newbies into the idea of sandbox more gradually. Even in the NPC corp it provides just that little bit of direction towards goals, a bit more community involvement with militia chat and publicly available militia fleets. At this point it needs a revamp but it should be something prominently promoted to every player after they've completed the combat career agents 
---
(Ideally also add some FW specific career agent missions too to teach the basics of FW to newly joined players: Defend a plex, capture a plex, buy &lt;thing&gt; with the LP, fight enemy player. They should do the same thing in other areas of the game that need a little more explanation than you get in the NPE. )
---
Yeah this is basically OTEC 2.0 and it's bad for the game for the same reason.
---
Yup. 100 percent this.
---
I actually like this suggestion a lot.  I may have to try it out.  I don't use navigation hotkeys much, and I probably should.
---
You're still a virgin, aren't you?
---
Use a better browser? Lol chrome is the shit btw. And its edge these days btw lol.
---
Oh man, where are the days of 500 rvb fights? ;-;
---
those other clowns fight for a BLUE null, RvB wage an eternal honor war over a teapot.
---
I don’t think any of these fleet losses are really bothering anyone from either side, well apart from you! Seems you’re really taking it personally?
---
Don't mine ore as an alpha, do something fun instead.
---
Got a timestamp or mm:ss for when the 3-axis action is shown? Fuck mobile twitch in all the holes.

Dude... It's a fucking video game.
---
I was propped and aligned, and still got caught...
---
Where the video starts from clicking the link should show the camera doing a left circle panning up or down and moving forward
---
B-b-but it's on the internet...
---
I have drone flying 5 but also have t2 stripminers on my mining barge. I'm not sure what level my mining drones are at.
---
Red with 'lightning' are jump drive activations.  Look for a ship at the center of the effect either appearing or disappearing.
---
After they jump onto the field, there is a massive deployment of fighters by carriers (camera zooms out and shows tons of tiny icons around large ships).
---
Other 'expanding sphere' or firework-like effects are AoE fleet bonuses.
---
Weapons trails (sharp lines between two ships).
---
Possible some remote repair (sort of like directed whiteish mist moving from one ship to another), and similarly energy transfer (darkish yellow).
---
Ah, fair do.  Whoosh moment for me, then.
---
So if you're an old enough eve player you'll remember the times that we would just make the fights bigger when CCP upgraded the server hardware.
---
Every time, without fail, the fights would get bigger until it broke.
---
So 32 bit, 64 bit, quantum computing, space magic, whatever, we'll find the breaking point.
---
Most people have left
---
Looking at the BR, I can’t work out anything. Because fuck mobile, I guess.
---
He is saying u are the king of diplo’ing away content and unhealthy for the game
---
Expecting spodbrains to know to f1 and anchor is a big joke
---
The "any gameplay that adversely affects my gameplay is bad" mentality is a major issue that I have seen from many of the nullsec block candidates
---
It's part of the continuing issue that I had with last CSM that killed combat interceptors when they pushed to remove the nullification property that defined the interceptors for me.
---
Part of the reason that, even though I am running for this term, Olmeca will be getting on of my votes.
---
Vote wormhole and small group focused candidates for some healthy variety in your csm.
---
Make Nullsec dangerous again!
---
Increase the game frecuency from 1 hz to 10 hz...
---
10 time more responsive, just to have better combats and less game inertia.....
---
So I just have to unsub and I won? Really? And 11 years before I joined reddit I never really played eve despite being a valuable member of the community? What is this, 2007?
---
That isn’t how this works. PAE has been standard since Pentium’s and solves this specific issue.
---
Example audio of Goon comms was recently posted.

I thank the OP for the choice of using music instead.

The Discourse is live with reporting on the on-going Triglavian scouting operations, which have already cost Capsuleers nearing half a trillion ISK in losses. :D What does the future hold? Where are the Xordazh-class world arks? Will cladistic proving mortify civilians along with Capsuleers? The Discourse will share news as soon as we have it. 
---
In the meantime, here are today's tickers: 
---
* Reduced Sansha activity indicates preparation for direct Triglavian attack
---
* Pundits name Colelie “Least Safe System for baseliners,” citing numerous past battles
---
* University of Caille Triglavian Language Extension Program sees massive uptick in registrations
---
* LUMEN announces Ammatar Mandate Economic Initiative, I-RED Participating
---
* Analysts note Triglavian rapid combat reactions, fleet reinforcement
---
* CalNav spokesperson lauds fast, fierce Capsuleer response to Haatomo Triglavian incursion
---
* Initial lapsed Triglavian incursions suspected to be probing attacks
---
Wouldn't it be cut off anyway when the airlock hatch closes?
---
Problem solved.
---
I know you're talking about citadels, but this comment got me thinking about sov. Do people timezone-tank their sov as well? And if so, what would happen if only activity *during your sov vulnerability windows* counted for raising ADMs?
---
And for your viewing pleasure here's 90 minutes of fight: [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/432646425](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/432646425)
---
Yea music does that on VODs allowed as live but not on recorded
---
When was this? Was it announced
---
They have the "lose your ship" mission as part of the military career agent which I think is good to try to get people to learn that first rule. 
---
I think they should add a couple more to the "advanced military" missions: 
---
1. Join a fleet with another player to run a mission.
---
2. Fight a duel against another player. (most likely losing the ship )
---
3. A more minor but super practical one... some mission which teaches them that d-scan is even a thing and a little bit of how to use it.
---
Why would they need to strike a deal? Like the botter has any fucking leverage lmao
---
They did it because they can.
---
Thanks, playback started from the beginning of the clip for me :|
---
its just some T1 battleships... really not that big of a deal
---
&gt; I found a Sabre in the wreck, boarded it and tried to get the fuck out.
---
I'm really surprised you lasted so long!
---
Generally, every F1 jockey will ignore the FC to shoot at a pod for a killmail.
---
The only time I've been on field in a pod so long, is in extreme tidi, then I suddenly found myself fleet-warping for the next 10 minutes.
---
Is flying a noctis new bro?? Doesn't it require a bit of specialization that a new player would be better off investing in the 14, or something else?
---
Seeing as everyone they transferred ISK to probably got those transactions reversed, I'd say not a lot, but still too much.
---
lol what. 
---
Because believe it or not, banning people is the last thing a gaming company wants
---
Nice work asilthar
---
For mining drones speed and sometimes durability are the important ones plus having mining drones to 5, of course.
---
You actually didnt get the massage. I dont care if we won or lost a fight. But why AS AN EX GSF FC taking a shittalk about goons when you could also say "Wow what a great fight!" ??? I just hate all this "oh we are sooo cool and you are sooooo bad".
---
Yeah, but they give you the ship to lose when you accept the mission.  I think popping the ship they have, then replacing it would be a better way to get that point across.
---
The SoE arc kind of pushes them toward fleets at the end of it.  Reinforcement is always a good thing though, so a mission to get that idea across would be a good addition.
---
D-scan would be a nice addition as well.  Didn't learn how to use it until I started Day tripping WHs.
---
in the grand scale? yes. There will always be 2,3 or 4 large blocs with their area of influence. That doesn't mean they control 100% of null, mostly because they don't care. You're forgetting so much it seems like you started playing in 2018 though. Low sec is dead, there used to be a bunch of alliances living in low doing null incursions. There used to be regions in null where small alliances could live. 
---
From the view as a worthless test linemember you may not see any difference, if you actually roamed around you would notice the huge decline in activity even just the last few years.
---
What else do we do during deployment than laugh at retards unable to figure out nobody is defending delve?
---
I'm equally curious if the investigation on these was as rushed as the Brisc situation.  I don't doubt that there are botters in eve but I have zero confidence in CCP and their ability to correctly identify them.
---
Its almost like there used to be more small alliances even if there always will be bigger fish
---
HAHA didn't we're laughing at them so the kills doesn't count exdee
---
Knows entire alliance is deployed in the North, mines with 13 Rorqs and a hel dies.
---
:pickchuface:
---
How in the fuck did 24 dreads lose *nothing* to a fucking *Hel*?! Was the super pilot just AFK or something?
---
i logged in my jita alt and flew into perimiter, nothing to see there :/
---
are we just going to ignore the offensive price  point they were released at?
---
1bn isk for a frigate skin? go fuck yourself ccp, you were doing so well with pricing on the last few releases.
---
What would they count towards?
---
If that shit mattered, why wouldn't we throw a thousand rorquals into panfam and awox them and celebrate the damage?
---
Tis hilarious
---
That's pretty much equivelent to `Haha nobody is defending tribute so it doesn't count`
---
What do you expect from a pilot that missed the "whole alliance is deployed" memo?
---
Yeah getting the same thing for the past few days
---
You are wrong. It is perfectly possible to spoof a MAC address or Hardware ID by using a virtual machine.
---
PCI-E GPU passthrough makes this possible. Not every VM host on the market has that functionality, but it definitely exists.
---
Yeap. Because those rorquals are alliance assets and important to stanging what not.
---
Uh, yeah, but this is eve so sometimes you have to remind people.
---
Well, they are flying in supers. So the isk value of the super itself, plus the skills they got injected with. I'm imagining it's a lot more than I think.
---
The Goon be having a bad day.
---
Correct, we even killed the chemo legions in the end. But that goes against the narrative here so down votes for you
---
SS fighters are a thing
---
Last night.  Sorta announced.  They did a [weird lolplay tweet](https://twitter.com/EveOnline/status/1134386424093073408) about it.
---
o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-oof
---
You mean they forgot to do it for a few days, they all ended up banned
---
But PL lives in Delve now so nothing in Tribute is alliance assets.
---
Why are you trying to push a really crappy designed BR tool that is practically unreadable on mobile? br.inyour.space is a great tool and just like 99% of online services it has its flaws. However is accurate when used correctly and is definitely readable on mobile.
---
Sounds about right. PL lives outside the jump range of Goon fleet.
---
The 64 bit client is going to be huge for video content creators. The only issue is frame rates. Even pushing a high end ryzen processor and Radeon 7 the frame rates only held at around 10FPS. (Which is an improvement from the 32 bit)
---
There are no bots in Goonswarm.
---
MFW you're reduced to bragging about killing the krabbiest of krabs, what happened to all those 'we want good fights' badposters?
---
Lol I fucking love how diverse our killmails are.
---
It stops when it starts to matter to goons.
---
Eat my ass
---
Was not there, but I know the feeling
---
Bring back sliding
---
32 bit processes don't have the integer space to use beyond 4GB of ram, i think is what he was referring to.
---
That’s kind of the point. We did. Twice in 24 hours.
---
Basing it off of what others have said.
---
Yes, and this is irrelevant because the host operating system is 64 bit and it knows that your process is 32 bit. The process doesn't manage swapping, the operating system does, and it can address more than 4GiB. It's also responsible for providing the address space to the process.
---
This is all to say that the operating system will handle it for you.
---
Well they gave it a good old try with the chat channels. I guess they succeeded in the end but the beta period wasn't fun at times.
---
This is a war of cringe, you are starting to make up for the initpost about st lucifer's draugur.
---
Hey cool I can see myself on his overview.
---
Eve was ccps first game.  Blizzard has been making games before
---
I have plenty of  isk to spare:) what I don't have is the time or patience for needless "distribution missions" lol
---
Last night 2hrs before DT, no.
---
any reason in particular? Or do you just like it better that way?
---
lol, one corp.. of miner alts..  that were told they will die if they are attacked, yeah. 
---
"already replaced" comes to mind.
---
I'm pretty sure EVE Uni did those one time. I know there were fits for at least 3 out of 4 starting corvettes.
---
phrasing
---
they probably had a mino and a ton of SS fighters.
---
They really are!
---
Hey, head over to /r/evejobs to find a corp!
---
r/evejobs
---
You mean steadily?
---
Some boody didn't get the memo
---
imagine a 2k alliance running from a 60k coalition lmao they suck so bad
---
K ill move it
---
you can't fix stupid, but you can ridicule it.
---
Very nice!
---
T2 fit?
---
put your logic away it has no place here.
---
But the pie chart!
---
Yes
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77018003/
---
Got this fit from a nice dude in BSB
---
thank you!
---
Imagine a 2k alliance putting itself in a place where they need to run away from a 60k alliance and bitching about it lmao
---
Death, loss of assets, and 1 sided slaughters. Bro I dont know what eve you've been playing but in the one I've played they have not and never will care.
---
Flair checks out
---
you would think all these old grunts in goons that have been around forever would actually learn something from history and tactics used by the much smaller just as old retirement home that goes by the name of NCPL. You would think they  would actually change a tactic lol... yea man eve is in a bad spot
---
yeah, they should just join imperium and mine in peace. doom wouldn't have to sell his rorqs
---
ur elite, sweetie
---
imagine that 2k alliance kicking the shit out of a 200 person alliance and bragging about it while complaining someone bigger was doing the same thing to them.
---
I wouldn't hold my breathe personally.  It's pretty obvious the new Cynojammers have turned this game into Strategic Gate-Camp Online. With their supers/caps being able to preposition and ours can't, I think this is going to turn into a stalemate.
---
I too get invaded then focus on killing rorqs in a region where they pulled 20 trillion a month. This is why y'all are losers.
---
I guess they couldn't ..... space tank that
---
As much as I like padding my kb with the stuff and ninja looting like the filthy poor that I am these botters will just fire up more accounts and with injectors being a thing they'll just buy a whole bunch of injectors and continue botting on more accounts. I feel like the only way we can get rid of bots (at least these super/cap bots) is to get rid of injectors so that people can't just make a new account, buy injectors, inject and do it all over again.
---
They won't because
---
&gt;they have not and never will care.
---
DM Someone for a referral link they give you quite the head start. You aren't allowed to post them here tho.
---
What was it that Doomchimp said... Test has talked enough shit, they should prepare to be homeless?
---
imagine thinking that a 200man alliance with the support of two alliance size sigs + Test in every major timer is the little guy lmao
---
also pl never deployed, nc. did, after Goons did.
---
This.
---
Absolutely this. There should not be a worry from smaller groups that the other side is going to bring a big alliance to the party. Keeping things at the same scale is important. That said the blame is on both sides: the small guys for calling and the big guys for answering.
---
Feeding the so-called "Pvpers" of large alliances (a euphemism for the drooling masses that just follow the FC) in what equates to hell dunks is not OK to be OK with it.
---
But also not being a bitch and asking for help is as equally valid.
---
If a pilot/corp/alliance can't stand on their own to make the game enjoyable they need to give it up and realize they are a F1 monkey.
---
fuck doom, hes a retard thinking pvp is good for this game. why would he blob a 40k coalition with his 2k elite pvpers??
---
Oh yeah, they were hella fun.
---
It wasn’t accurate when I was trying to use it for this BR, it was off by about 10 bil for both sides, despite me setting up the teams correctly. Until br.inyour.spacee starts working correctly I’m not going to use it
---
someone made a poll and with that we kind a hit a tril of stuff killed in delve till you are deployed
---
Phoenix has the Chrome skin. You can't beat that.
---
After last nights extravaganza, the guys gotta do something till y'all come back
---
What dps are you looking for when using this fit?
---
Meh, he's alright. Can't be worse than any of the others. Low sec needs fair representation. Null politics will blue eve to death.
---
How about fighting in the main battle up north. Instead of fetching morale kills?
---
If you were trying to build the BR right after the fight sometimes it will have some of the data from zkillboard. You need to give it some time after a big fight (noticed the bigger the fight the more you had to wait) before actually analyzing and getting an accurate BR. As you can see from another comment they were able to build the same BR accurately using br.inyour.space.
---
Dreadbombs are hard especially when the only people left there are rorquals and pilots who don’t pvp. Man you guys must be proud of shooting fish in a barrel. Super hard. I bet you link AARs about killing cyno rookie ships too
---
Players will always do what they need to do to secure the win. Its CCP that needs to do something. Force projection right now is insane. Both Goons and PANFAM can get to the frat/test frontline in under 30 mins, without fatigue. None of those are "small" but the point is defending space right now is to easy
---
CCP have also made a system where you need to have a supercap fleet or be friendly to the regional superpower to live in low/null. Fuck moon changes
---
no
---
He's pointing out your spelling error in the title.
---
I mean goons brag about killing uncontested astras so
---
Well the SoE arc is probably easier at the end if you join a fleet but I there's nothing telling you that (at least not that I remember). Or even anything pushing you to do the SoE arc in the first place... You only know it exists to do at all if other people tell you about it.
---
Which gets back to CCP doing a better job of bridging that gap. There needs to be some things they can do to provide guidance easing the new player into the sandbox. I think that's the whole point of "the agency" and maybe the latest revision will do a better job but I suspect it's only a partial solution.
---
If you like mining my corp is always recruiting
---
Read his comment one more time though, first major battle and you fucked up big time
---
The "new map" has been beta for years. I suspect the ccptime for the 64bit client will be better though.
---
&gt;d Eve's new player retention is horrible and I honestly don't think it's the NPE itself at fault but that there's no bridge between the NPE and any of the self-directed activities in the sandbox that are the most fun.
---
you Sir deserve more then one upvote
---
hey i can put chrome on a turd but id rather take the butcher's word... wait.
---
Not too bad, flew 15 or 16 systems to pick something up, got back to my original destination and had left half of the shit behind, I was tired in my defense, but I had brought the wrong ship to pick up stuff and it didn't have room.
---
 you can't fix Goons, but you can ridicule it.
---
I think I know what you are talking about, its radio chatter static, might be when you mouse over a sig.
---
Very
---
pvp is good for this game.
---
He gave this statement AFTER a real coalition started moving against TEST.
---
Then again, doom being a retard is more the rule that an exception.
---
what real coalition? 
---
Test outnumbered their enemies by far.
---
They are idiots for that too. This war is boring as hell to me. They retreat to go shoot things in delve instead of fighting and defending? It’s confusing. I understand standing down being outnumbered or whatever but most of the times I’ve been around for fleets it’s been within 100 people. But one side stands down. What happened to good fights?
---
"Stimulus" if you want to be included in some of the best small gang psuedo-open NPSI fleets this side of Uedama.
---
Oh yeah fix it sry
---
I was going to post this BR just after it happened. Decided someone else would probably write an intelligent or insightful Reddit post about it.
---
That person was sadly, not you.
---
How have i not known about this sub before. Ty
---
I think you care too much. Sometimes that's a good thing, like if you work in a hospital or at an animal shelter, but doesn't really apply to internet spaceships.
---
Eve has sound?
---
Jesus christ you actually make Goons look good with this spergpost.
---
Without goons it would have been a fair fight. Shame doom didn't shut the fuck up.
---
When you have relied on paying pets for the last 10 years to act as a wall and protect you.. yep. Goons proper are fucking garbage people both in life and in game.
---
May I have a link to that please?
---
But what about the opportunity cost of your gaming time? You're losing real money!
---
Imagine being as retarded as OP.
---
l know this is just propaganda but there just space pixels, how about you undock and retake all the ihubs you have lost at least
---
or put out propaganda that your ok with running away and not defending your space ?
---
Paps?
---
https://imgur.com/a/VIiPCpD
---
EVE needs more radio chatter IMO. Maybe a sound toggle, but dynamic chatter would be nice. Like when you're mining and you hear chatter talking about onboard processors or when you're in a fight and chatter rolls off random targeting data.
---
I was not part of this gank. But of the fleet taking back or defending the sh1 ihub today. If this counts
---
Not if your unemployed! Lol
---
I saw someone trying to form one for shits and giggles the other day, was trying to get 20-30 people in Blaster Velators with ECM drones.
---
Yeah, that's gonna be tough to get to 60. I guess if you can figure a way to move the camera suuuper slow and smooth, then speed up the footage to counter tidi you would get the best "movie aesthetic" and fps wouldn't matter that much, although that wouldn't be representive of CCPs product :P
---
Bit more complicated than that unfortunately due to a number of factors.
---
Talking to him like he's a goon :thinking:
---
Thats a damn good idea if you get it off the ground. I make spread sheets but nothing api or esi as its called now.
---
If rats warp in on you I think it does.  But could be more absolutely. Some actual chatter would be good to instead of noise lol
---
made you press f1
---
I already said you can't beat it
---
Casually steals sabre.
---
So the Goon line is that WH- just didn't happen, eh?
---
A bold move, Cotton. Let's see if it pays off.
---
See thats better,  l find no matter what  side of the fence you am on a good def or attack report or propaganda is better then LOL look we killed idiot Krabs
---
Economic warfare is a *thing*. That *exists*.
---
...like last night's extravaganza?
---
I agree with the tractors and salvagers combined but scripted is lame.. We dont need an aoe salvager they just need a small range buff and an auto targeting system to work on them wrecks  while on a noctis would be amazing. But again.. Scripts are lame.. Lol
---
F. U.
---
Isn't that basically the motto of GSF?
---
Because last time this happened PL killed a super(s)/Titan/rorq(s) a day for weeks it got to the point r/eve employed the killmails need aar accompaniment rule.
---
Same. Only crash was on the way to the fight. Frame rate was low but otherwise reliable. Will try 64 bit next time around.
---
Aww, you think botting is a solvable problem without a complete overhaul of the game. How cute!
---
Chemo kills cancer.
---
:)
---
we can afford it.
---
True enough, I usually save all my random shit and either reprocess or make 1 freighter trip every few months
---
Cotton ? lets keep race out of this its just space pixels and seeing how much of a rise you can get from each other on r/eve.
---
And l have no idea what WH you am on about and l don't really care l was just saying a good def or attacking BR is better then look idiot Krabs died.
---
Not having ESI correct is a huge fine apparently as well
---
Not the ihubs! How will they ever recover?
---
Is this supposed to be some kind of dank razor alliance meme?
---
oh yeah good idea OP since you havent created an account yet - this will give you a bunch of free skill points
---
Hopefully into a better empire that can defend there space or pass leader ship to people who can inspire people to join defend and grow and be better then they am.
---
Until the debt collectors come by
---
Since everyone just changes what "winning" is to fit the current spin, it doesn't mean that much
---
Thanks for the insight. I'm sure Hedliner will take it under advice.
---
Fuckin' paid actors! :)
---
Looks like PanFam has been doing a good job at killing bees lately. You could contact Redline, he specifically did a bang up job last night
---
&gt;Cotton ? lets keep race out of this its just space pixels and seeing how much of a rise you can get from each other on [r/eve](https://www.reddit.com/r/eve/).

AAA use to live in esoteria looks like he loged in after a few years and found test there.
---
Goons aren’t, but those guys are
---
The problem is you might have one or two items in a dozen plus stations in a region.  Not worth collecting them but sending one Alt with Max trade skills to Simply remote sell everything not in a large groupworks
---
I'm appreciative of all the posts about the big epic war with no battles and only retarded bears dying
---
thx for reminding me that wh space best space
---
You can't fix goons but you can throw stupid at it.
---
Is that a real question
---
Change *what* tactics? Letting dumb shits die during deployments has worked so far.
---
I don't want to see how rorqual are fitted, but I guess that 13 rorqual + 1 super could kill some dreads before they die.
---
*read this in Triglavian voice*
---
Okay yes, you can be safe inside a pos lol. Or at a ridiculously deep incursion+burn for like 3 days safe. Nobody will find that lol.
---
Who would have thought a person who doesn't leave goon space, has goon killmails
---
 [https://www.thealphasguide.com](https://www.thealphasguide.com/)
---
You are projecting again friend, maybe stick to sips of the koolaid instead of mainlining grrgewns grape all day.
---
I was in goons at the time and yes I remember the space highway well. And the ability to move a cap or super across that distance in 5 minutes
---
It needs to be locked by you first, but if you unlock it after instructing them to engage, they'll keep going until told otherwise. Which means you can lock a guy up, drop drones, press "f", MWD to outwith his and your lock range, and the drones will stay pinging him (he'll probably aggro on and kill them before they kill him, so not exactly a perfect tactic, but can give you space to get your bearings before moving back in).
---
I can’t tell if you’re living under a rock or just very bad at shilling for goons.
---
I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume ignorance ...
---
As for which ‘WH’, it was the major battle over the NC. &amp; PL SH1 staging Keepstar IHub yesterday. Goons + pets formed over 1200 vs the North’s 900ish and still got curb stomped (100ish billion lost by tapirium of the galaxy vs 50ish billion lost by the North).
---
A day late a dollar short and completely fucking wrong.
---
Lmao
---
Watching this gave me motion sickness
---
Not on either side, but burning every structure leftover in enemy territory sets them back months of economic growth.  When goons go back to delve, it'll be back to winning MER, where the north has to rebuild, replace, etc.  This is an economic war that doesn't show up on killboards like killmails.
---
Posting a KM from May 26 pls delete yourself.
---
Eve is so beautiful when you can actually see it.
---
Ooooh that's actually super helpful, thanks!
---
ahhh I see.  I'm fortunate to have done that already so everything i own is either lost in a WH or in one of two stations.
---
Sounds good to me actually, Wanna toss me your guys elevator speech?
---
I feel like imperium is winning the economic war so hard that no amount of killmails will even dent them.
---
Who pays for the Discourse? Is CCP involved?
---
yes the 9 pilots from PL/PH that took part in this instead of toasting are really the reason Tribute is burning
---
Pretty convinced that if there was molten gold somewhere and you told a krab that it's hot, they'd still try to grab it.

Just pay for the game, alpha is just a glorified trial
---
No l just don't follow every fight there just space pixels, l have my own way to enjoy eve and lm sorry thats its not a big thing for me when a combined 150bill is lost in a fight its ... meh 
---
But .. l do enjoy reading a good battle report tho l must say l just find we killed Krabs a waste of time as Krabs am gona Krab.
---
This is eve 2019. orbit gate at current, netflix on
---
Sad that redline showed he has none. Used to kinda like him. Didn't really believe everything being said about him but he has shown that it's true. He really is a trashy piece of shit.
---
Mediocre FC beats Asher Elias despite having zero advantages? Quite impressive.
---
Its a record of having participated in a fleet. Dunno what the actual acronym is.
---
i think i need to go to the doctor cuse this music gave me cancer
---
I wonder if they noticed.
---
PL was in the main battle is was a good part of the reason we won it. Then they jump cloned to delve and dropped on some rorquals.
---
This looks like what you'd get if EVE had an FPS test.
---
Hiya.
---
There is a very good reason that high end mining capacity is locked behind a pay wall.
---
Basically, the economy of eve would be obliterated if access to mining were completely unlocked for free accounts. 
---
Long story short. Imagine the ability to run 30 rorquals for free on every player account. 
---
You've simply underestimated the effect of your expectations.
---
I can go into more detail if you like but I think you get the picture.
---
Fucking nice, lowsec definitely needs more attention. This will help.
---
EVE Online is not a F2P game. It is a P2P game with an overly generous trial.
---
10/10 will use again.
---
Wts a hel in 1dq
---
delve nanofag cloaky terrorist edgelords are stepping it up
---
There's a good reason that eve doesn't open up options for passive income for F2P players. 
---
Because passive income is very easy to scale, allowing F2P characters to make use of those income methods would allow anyone to set up hundreds of passive income toons. Restricting passive income sources (and resource extraction in general) to P2P only, puts a fairly effective cap on the amount of potential abuse of F2P accounts. 
---
That said, there are ways of making P2P accounts work like a F2P farm, but those methods are somewhat complicated and involved, (PI/SP farms being a thing you could look into). 
---
If you want to play with a focus on resource extraction, F2P exploration is a good way to get some startup ISK (the in game currency), and then you could use that ISK to buy P2P status on you account, at which point it's possible to mine/PI/etc enough each month to keep your account in P2P status. 
---
However, my personal recommendation: Buy a three month subscription, and re-sub if you enjoyed those three months. at $12-15 per month, it's an inexpensive hobby, and the friends you will make in game are more than worth the cost of a subscription.
---
Well damn, sounds pretty much like what I'm looking for.   
---
I'm hit up Evejobs as well, but you guys are now on my radar.   
---
There are no wolves on Fenris.
---
I’ll toggle it to see my tolerance. Shadows already gave me a huge bump. Low shaders should make it smooth at that rate. Hopefully it isn’t too potato looking. 
---
God I remember when this laptop was too much for EVE.
---
Nah, shoot and neut the super first and it’s pretty game over man.
---
Corporations, especially in the major alliances, require players to participate in a certain number of official fleets every month to stay in good standing.  The Corp I’m in requires a minimum of 6 per month.  Karmafleet requires 1 every 3 months.
---
Participation Link =&gt; paplink =&gt; pap =&gt; (seagull) pap! Pap! Pap! Pap!
---
Alpha clones are an extended trial demo mode. It's supposed to be so you can try out different aspects of the game, without delving too deeply into any of them. And if you decide you really like the game, you start paying for Omega and access to the rest of the game.
---
Sadly, a lot of Alphas keep whining and crying (not saying you are, not saying you aren't) that they want access to more and more and more. And if CCP isn't careful, they're going to give away access to everything tempting, and Alphas won't have any motivation to actually start paying.
---
Someone say boot.ini ?
---
you do not understand Eve in the slightest, this is clear
---
please go back to wow
---
You should probably reread that comment fam!  It's quite the opposite spodbrain

That is quality dude!
---
i'm glad that we have these friendship threads, eve can get so combative at times, and it's nice to have a reminder this game is a hobby that we all have in common.
---
Please join our channel if you want to meet some of our guys and get to know us more
---
Yeah well said Ash. All I see on this thread are people who think they know what’s going talking absolute bollocks and the others harping on about how irrelevant FEDUP is spending so much of their salty time talking about us. The irony.
---
Hopefully now Aider is going back to FW, all their inactive pilots will start logging in again and the corp will be able to field more than 20 regulars from their 122 pilots. I wish them the best of luck.  They’re going back to where they want to be.
---
There is a fuckton of good prop out there. It is just all aimed internally. Everyone has a side by now, just gotta keep morale up.
---
More to the point, where the fuck was their super fleet? They formed and then just sat there.
---
Nothing can possibly make up for that post.
---
That’s awesome!
---
Pap?!
---
But muh narrative!
---
So you want an interesting and exciting game but choose to do mining, PI and a passive play style?
---
that screen real estate. ultrawides are the best.

All players have a referral link that benefits both parties. If you make an account, find some content creator on youtube or twitch or something that you like their video and grab a referral link. Don't ask in the forums, dont think its allowed.

Gorgeous.
---
nah, i don't think so. there's something about a sandbox that's gratifying in a different way. A world with consequence. Gaining wealth, large strategic fleet fights, persistence, all that stuff. 
---
i guess it would probably have an impact on the average number of people undocked and around. eh.
---
Ultrawide screens are cool, but I've always found that having multiple monitors usually allows more than 1 ultrawide.
---
Show me these small coalitions on the 2014 sov map, other than Provi.
---
They dont give a shit about bot subs, what they know and you don't, is that botters will happily resub to continue. They lose no income by banning bots.
---
wh space really is the best space. loot pinatas are really fun!
---
Man this makes me even more hyped to go 32:9. Been waiting for the 1440p version which looks to be [coming next month](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/monitors/gaming/49-crg9-dual-qhd-curved-qled-gaming-monitor-lc49rg90ssnxza/).
---
Are you trying to get the current stocks on market? 
---
If so you can pull the appropriate region order book and filter down to location. 
---
If you want to know specific peoples orders, you will need access to their personal order book via esi and cross-reference order ids.
---
Of course they loose income retard, bots buy plex with isk, someone buys that plex
---
So your strategy is:
---
1. Deploy 1300 titans to a piece of empty space,
---
2. Get smashed on the 1SH iHub,
---
3. Lose hundreds of billions in isk as your Delve krabbers die, and 
---
4. Say "this is going fine!"
---
Yes it would have, shame goons can gat that easily triggered lmao
---
Multiple ultrawides is the solution...
---
64 bit client looks exactly like the 32 for me.
---
Used to agree with this statement. But the software that this monitor comes with makes it so much better IMO.  [https://displaysolutions.samsung.com/solutions/monitor-solution/easy-setting-box](https://displaysolutions.samsung.com/solutions/monitor-solution/easy-setting-box)
---
I got the picture, without devaluing mining the game can't sustain its economy..
---
I didn't think it was possible to be salty about "winning".  You proved me wrong.  Thanks.
---
What the fuck?
---
Anyone is different!
---
That where the trick is..
---
, Cynojammer on
---
He's probably referring to the different corps/alliances working together.
---
Never played WoW. 
---
As you can understand by my original post I do not like subscription games..
---
Again, that's where the trick is..
---
The intended output would just be is the market stocked Yes/No at a minimum. If we could derive values of the resource it would allow planning forecasting as well. Looking at the API I kind of feel like the best approach is just to pull each persons orders through ESI and filter the data that way. I wish I could just pull a specific NPC station and see the orders present. As this is a distance station with few orders it would be an easy way to just see everything seeded at the operations area.
---
Tbh panfam will be too op with all the good advice from these goon redditors
---
You already can run 30 rorquals for thanks to skill injectors
---
Consider ftp a trial. Wanna do all the other things? Then sub
---
As an alpha you can Huff gas and make lots of isk.
---
As I said in the original post, there are plenty of F2P games that sustain themself by giving cosmetics or little perks to paying players while keeping all contents free for F2P players. Like Dota 2 or Planetside 2..
---
Also, by making the game more available to F2P players you get a larger playerbase that could potentially become addicted to the game and start investing in cosmetics and in those little perks (like access to certain regions, access to certain activities (look for the subscription pass of Dota 2)).
---
Now play lofi hip hop over it.
---
The one I have is a bit too low res. It's noticeable in the beginning, but then you forget about it.  So 1440p will be awesome! No doubt.
---
Thanks for your reply, you made me understand the whole situation.
---
I will then try the exploration path and pay myself Omega with in-game currency to start the extraction path!
---
But with Omega!
---
Your alliance foots the bill for those losses?
---
Reminds me so much of the view out of the cockpit of something.
---
FYI, it's already out. I should know i've bought one already and it's just amazing XD
---
The best propaganda sounds like a war cry to your enemies, like a rallying cry to your allies, and like autistic screeching to 3rd parties.
---
Thatsthejoke.gif
---
Is it possible to ban their MAC address? that way they wouldn't even be able to login from any account aslong they don't buy a new pc
---
This guy gets it
---
holy shit the 64 bit client has actually changed everything
---
o/
---
Yes with omega! Which pays for itself
---
No trick. EVE makes it pretty clear that Alpha is just an extended trial period.
---
This isn't CCP's bad marketing, it's your lack of basic literacy.
---
7o test Bros, best bros
---
...limiting the number of people who can mine does the *opposite* of devaluing mining.
---
I think he means we can afford for idiots to be idiots and lose their shit.
---
i hope ccp reverts the exploration change, removes local, makes citadels' reinforcement timer tied to stront and fixes the game!
---
It's not, we have a guy in corp who is over a month at this point.
---
Wanting something you didn't get isn't a trick.  They're very clear about alphas not being able to do much.
---
I mean the average goon can afford to lose their shit and replace it.
---
Spodbrain is contagious.
---
But then that's an empty statement that doesn't mean anything...
---
&gt;delving
---
*Literally triggered*
---
Woosh!  That's joke going over my head
---
Make some?
---
Be the change you want to see
---
The average goon can afford to lose 100b + time lost from not krabbing, multiple times? I wonder for how long :)
---
Moreover, your expectation would lead to a requirement to run a baseline of x rorquals just to play the game as everyone goes about devaluing isk and pumping yet more alts full of injectors.
---
Effectively reducing the value of time spent on the game to zero....
---
Hang on a sec... This is happening now.
---
ssshhhhhhhh
---
Propaganda always sounds idiotic to the enemy. Problem for you guys is that since you fell from a top-level group to an average group, all the *good* propaganda is on the enemy's side, so it all sounds like autistic screeching to you. What remains is your own propaganda, which sounds bad because it's so obviously false.
---
&gt;As I said in the original post, there are plenty of F2P games that sustain themself by giving cosmetics or little perks to paying players while keeping all contents free for F2P players. Like Dota 2 or Planetside 2..
---
Cool. EVE isn't one of those games.
---
Consider that maintaining the single-shard nature of the game requires running something like the 3rd or 4th most powerful server *in the world*. Shit ain't cheap, and $15 a month *or less* isn't that high a price for access to the greatest space-based MMO in the world.

---
Where? Everything online shows June/July for the new model.
---
Then clearly EVE isn't the game for you and you should try something else.
---
Interesting that Snuff appears on the KM of bad goonies and yet not on Panfam affiliated alliances. Have they been infiltrated by Panfam agents and become another Panfam pet?
---
Literally unplayable
---
Very nice pic. 9/10
---
The biggest casualty was closing that alliance and losing the mjolnir logo
---
How long is a piece of string.
---
If CCP made all content free for f2p players, it would unleash a tide of horror the likes of which you cannot comprehend. AFK cloakers in every system, since everyone can now multibox cloaky free accounts. Bot legions stripping the belts dry, since they can multibox an army of mining barges. Markets crash as industry players gain unlimited slots. Trust me, you don't want CCP to make all content free.
---
welcome to /r/eve.
---
Hel also wasn’t crazy heavy tanked, might’ve had fibos not anticaps, died real quick. Don’t think they had a mino
---
Yeah.  Think they should tie the SoE arc into the end of the new player experience.  If nothing else, it gets people moving around.
---
It is a tough gap to bridge, introducing the sandbox.  [The Butterfly Effect](https://youtu.be/08hmqyejCYU) video was the best we example of it in their promo vids.  While not the best one they have done, it really pushed the idea home.
---
I'm sure they have more in the works for new player introduction.  Be interesting to get a peek as to what it is.
---
What are some inexpensive implant options that give battle stats? there is so many sets its confusing.
---
I think ive heard those referenced. Something about Stain and Lowsec

aaaand then test got clapped

it was PL's IHUB you didnt contest today which can only get recapped by PL... so yerah courently  you got stomped in two regions today.

They didn't move it to a holding corp?

News flash. To us killboards dont mean shit. Thats why we dont transfer krabs or dying structures out of allisnce

I want a 360 seamless wrap around monitor. Not sure how I'd use it, but just to have it would be fun.

Chrome is the standard :(

I personally use a years obsolete version of Firefox with updates and addon verification disabled, because of addons I value.  It has scripting disabled by default, and I only enable obvious CDN sites.

That's what you get when you cram 40k j4gs into a single region: fertile farmland.

That's where you want 8k per eye VR. Chatted to the oculus Devs at an old fanfest and they said 8k per eye is the sweet spot where you can't easily tell it's a screen. Of course they said it was a pipe dream at the time

nice, fucking nice. SC was dead anyway

Don’t be a poor and pay for the game. Actually don’t, I’m glad the P2P system keeps entitled people like you out. There’s no such thing as a free lunch.

Wrong, and learn to spell and use basic punctuation before calling someone a retard.

i was gonna post "how long until 1/3 of the thread is ghostile trying to do damage control?" but he beat me to it

Don't remember last time we had propaganda.
---
Don't confuse propaganda and test spinning will you ?
---
Apparently you’re not familiar with who Elitist Ops is.
---
No you have to not be in game, not log into eve client and not be on r/eve or you have not won
---
&lt;3 welcome back! 🙌🏾
---
I just orgasmed.
---
They DO NOT made it clear that EVE isn't really a F2P but a P2P.
---
Look at the video where CCP Games announced the F2P turn: https://youtu.be/sPFII3ozSHI
---
Quotes:
---
"Pursuing lives of adventure, warfare and prosperity, in they share their existence in the biggest single shard [not sure about "shard", I'm not english mother tongue]  FREE TO PLAY mmo of all times!"
---
Nope, from the replies on this post it clearly isn't a F2P.
---
"There are hundreds of ships to fly in EVE. Everything from small nimble crafts and versatile mid-range vessels to formidable warships and colossal frigates. Each has advantages and suited roles but ALL ARE COMPLETELY CUSTOMISABLE as you decide how to equip and arm them."
---
Nope, they are not "completely customisable", CCP just locked ALL the mining equipments as you and I told..
---
"What you do in New Eden is ENTIRELY UP TO YOU. EVE's immense sandbox GIVES THE OPPORTUNITY to CHOOSE between MULTIPLE professions and activities. The key to this UNIQUE CUSTOMISATION OF YOUR PLAYSTYLE is skill training." 
---
Nope, CCP decided where I can and I cannot specialise my playstyle, there nothing "up to me", there is no "unique costumisation of my playstyle" as you saw mining being locked to me.
---
"As a new player you can focus on one specific area in order to quickly REACH THE SAME LEVEL of specialisation as A VETERAN."
---
Nope, almost all high-end skills paths are just BLOCKED for Alphas.
---
There are even more for each subject discussed in the video..
---
I found out that the Ship Maintenance Bay of a Hel can hold 102 velators.
---
You're welcome.
---
I'm holding out for space magic.
---
What are they going to do unless they have Shadows for some reason?
---
well that sucks D':
---
Look at what I wrote in response to Minues
---
&gt; EVE Online is not a F2P game. It is a P2P game with an overly generous trial.
---
factually untrue
---
Someone not from TEST, boi.
---
Average goons dont fly rorqs. I know Goons that can get hundreds of solo kills every month, but they dont have the isk to fly a rorqual. Or as bored to buy one, maybe both.
---
That what I said, if CCP doesnt devalue mining and gives free access to all contents for F2P users the economy would be ruined!
---
Well, I joined Horde because I remembered how PL used to play the last time I was active, they where robber barons and thugs, destroying and pillaging everything they could. And I remember when titans where first introduced, and I remember PL and corps like them telling everyone that doomsdays where a really bad idea. I remember having a big formup (for my current alliance at the time) with equal numbers at the time, and I remember loosing that battle at the press of a button.  
---
When I come back in todays eve, titans are everywhere, they are the content deniers and blockers that PL and PL like corps said they would be. So no, I will vote for them, but Olmeca is very high on my list, and if I am disappointed in my blocks canditates, Olmeca will get all my votes.
---
Every group in the game has dumb f1 monkeys. 
---
Get off your high horse.
---
Someone told be that Omegas now cost 2 billions ISK while years ago it costed like 500 millions. Maybe that's the case..
---
If you want to pay for a game that originally tricked you!
---
I'm considering I'm considering..
---
I'm interested in that path tho!
---
Give it another 5 or ten years.
---
You move from one point of the universe to another to overshoot structures with DPS limiter.
---
Of course you care about killboards, dont lie to yourself.
---
share some Please?
---
There is not such thing as a free lunch, if something is free others pay for you while you keep the game active or you are just the product not the service. 
---
Clearly EVE did not learnt neither of this facts..
---
Thanks for telling me!
---
You just want to get offensive while I just wrote a polite and honest question giving the background. 
---
Do not get triggered pls
---
Clearly you are, since you fail to understand that CCP is talking up the full features of the game, and not merely the limited set you have while you TRY the game out.
---
Giving that I agree with you but I doubt EVE's servers are that huge..
---
If you want to immerse yourself in the true reality of what goon swarm currently embodies, just think about the fact that it was thirteen rorquals, one player, and in the grand scheme of things nobody in goonswarm gives a shit.
---
In what other alliance would that be an oh well, let's laugh at our alliance mate. Test maybe? In most hed be roasted for losing that much of the alliances industrial output, in goonswarm it's just Thursday.
---
So I've been spending $30 a month on...what, exactly?
---
your glass is empty.
---
I would play/watch this with a helmet that has limited vertical vision to get more of the real world effect.
---
Goddamn, you're *precious*.
---
Filled it. It's empty again. Bottle too...
---
As I do not really understand all these elements due to the fact I've played the game for the first time only these last two days I would agree with you, as you know more than me about that
---
Nope, it's player run. The Scope is the one that is run by CCP.
---
You can fly literally dozens of ships other than the like 6 mining ships that are locked behind omega my guy
---
Well they do an amazing job, keep up the good work
---
Second, isn't it? Goons fed pretty hard a week ago for some Fortizar timer iirc. More than they did for this timer (~75b)
---
That's the video FOR THE FREE TO PLAY TURN man hahahah it's literally in the title
---
Active booster? The sound for them plays as if you just used one every time you undock or switch ships.
---
your screen cost almost like my entire PC...
---
Im joining Frat, let me see you soon mate
---
I'm not or I wouldn't opened such a post expecting morons like you not contributing to my questions and doubts :)
---
https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/implants/
---
That will show you the cost of complete sets. If you click on the link in each set it will take you to a page telling you what it does.
---
Nice, Ive been doing that if I have an inty or any other ~~whoring~~ useless ship. I snugged a mobdepo nestor off some titan wreck last year :D
---
Yeah but how to make my playstyle work, that's my initial question man
---
Do something more interesting than fucking mining or pay for a sub lmao
---
I have it at 3 currently.
---
Just telling me not to try enjoying a game, sure..
---
I miss the days of good propaganda.
---
You just don't understand what an advertisement is, do you?
---
We've been more than contributing. You've just refused to listen.
---
Mining is quite possibly the most unenjoyable, mind numbingly boring thing that you can do in eve just FYI
---
Talk about what's said in the ad, not about me. Why making it personal? 
---
Give me facts.
---
Ayee nice. Will keep you boys in mind,l for the future always, SC died once we moved to fight CVA after snuffed out took out our structures didn't it..
---
Meh hasn't been gone that long if it's not large rigged. F none the less.
---
I dont think they did
---
Open trade window to an alt and get unlimited corvettes.
---
never had one of these am interested but is the monitor not tall enough and looks short so I get its wide but is to short ?
---
Can't see how you are by making fun of me and telling me I lack in literacy, those are just free offenses!
---
Tell me which other path I can choose then please! That's my question
---
If you live near a big city you can grab a pair or 1080 monitors for $150 a lot of the time, a lot of the same effect at a fraction of the cost.
---
"fucking garbage people both in life and in game"
---
Peace be with you.
---
You realize we just dunked his entire logi wing a few days before... with no losses.  He left after being removed and losing keys.
---
Yeah booo goons for not using supers in a jammed system, GF as usual NCDOCK
---
The mountains on the backgroud compose the picture amazingly!
---
Last night.
---
Note for future videos. Maybe don't leave your visa card on the desk... Beautiful though!
---
I was wondering why the CHG90's price has been dropping so much recently. I really, really, really want one.
---
Nullsec exploration, literally anything in wormhole space, lowsec FW pvp
---
Where is tidi slow motion PvP?
---
Hehe, it's blocked. Will toss it in the bin 😊
---
a lot of it is probably the idea that time wasted not having fights isn't really wasted cause you get LP and system control. So the downtime becomes way less noticeable.
---
Don't feed the troll. Just look at his post history.
---
Bring your own salvager, then.
---
We have it under closure, CPTRingo has the ability to reactivate it at anytime
---
Did you get what you asked for?
---
What are the best settings for the 64bit client?
---
Same as a regular 27 inch
---
We do, just that theres also 4 other neutrals trying to salvage in frigs :P
---
If you have a lot of ram, I'd enable the resource cache, the rest is really up to your PC specs and GPU.
---
Last time I looked, the WoW trial was to Level 20.  Similarly, with the apt path analogy that you used, Eve has limits in the free to play mode.  For example, you can only really get to Venture mining but not to Exhumers or Capital Industrials.
---
Yes. That is what made them fun. The fact that we knew we wouldn't have to fly back afterward.
---
It's a time zone thing. I miss out too but, it's still pretty cool.
---
Talking shit while docked.
---
Good. Don't want you getting scammed IRL
---
The nyx has been handed off. look forward to see the action, i may fly an alpha there to join the fun if time allows.
---
This is probably the best explanation of the whole thing.
---
Nah macs can be spoofed and all sorts of shit
---
One thing that seem to not be mentioned in this post is plex. The ability to just buy omega with in game currency. 
---
So if you want to play for free, join a null sec group like PH, check the moon schedule. Your game time will revolve around this for about 100 hours, probably less. Soon as you have 2.2 bill isk buy 500 plex and train in to a procurer. With a proc you can get your next month of omega in 20, probably less depending on jackpot moons. Also making sure you set up your pi in that first month.
---
Due to the high amount of hours it takes to get that first month, i highly recommend you just ask a local or friend if they want to  for some extra cast like yard work. One hour helping a old man deweed a garden or 100 hours mining, guess what i would choose.
---
Also it kinda suck, the starter pack was just free on steam. That would of gave you some omega time
---
Pretty dumb on CCP's part not making ninja salvaging suspect
---
But on the other hand looking at those frigate and destroyer swarming around is pretty hilarious
---
I was today trying mining with the Nereus, isn't that good? It has a lot of cargo capacity.
---
I wouldn't mind as much but the npcs never switch to them for us.
---
Thanks for this, that's a good advice to start and gain Omega to then try sustain it via whatever playstyle I would like take.
---
Thanks again!
---
32gb but older 2600k.  Older video card.
---
As another guy told me that a good path to get and then try to sustain Omega with whatever path I would like to choose, thanks!
---
It's out there- just gotta filter it between CCPLS and REEE threads
---
ew, why are you on mobile
---
Yeah I'd just play with your settings to see what works best, you won't run out of physical ram so that's good. I would just figure out what delivers your best frame rates. My GPU was way underutilized by EVE during Tidi, it wasnt pushed hard at all and definitely had more headroom to use.
---
All f2p games have a cap before you have to fork over SOMETHING, you will pay CPP in cash, or inject enough building mats into the market for them to let you PLEX your account.
---
If you want to be passive, buy a Star Pack, set up all three toons to do PI, then mine to your hearts content, as long as you cough up 2.4B isk a month to keep Omega through PLEXing, which your PI sshould cover if you get all toons to IV/IV with PI skills and do it good, then you can do whatever with whats left and what you mine.
---
Hell you could save up 6B ISK and buy PLEX and two MPTCs, that will take forever and be soul crushing though.
---
&gt;Ontop of it all, the people who ninja salvage never get shot by the npcs.
---
the wreck of my heron begs to differ.
---
can confirm
---
You have access to a game for *free*. You can play forever in frigates and destroyers, ventures, t2 guns. You don't have to pay a cent to CCP. Yet you're saying you feel tricked?
---
  Eve free to play is meant to be a permanent trial- until you feel you're confident in taking the next step and subbing up.
---
To bad you have to play with that darn window bar. Sweet monitor. Is it only 60hz?
---
You're right- it IS free to PLAY, not free to fly mining barges and capitals.
---
MFW everyone just want to fucking mine rocks
---
