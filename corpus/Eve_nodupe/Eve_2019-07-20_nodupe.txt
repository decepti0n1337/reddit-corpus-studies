What, you want to go hunting with a battleship? Have fun with slow warps, slow align, slow locks, and taking twice the time to hunt targets as a T3c.
---
---
---
So good.
---
Ah fuck
---
Yes, but it's really not worth the slots and fitting room since you're only getting 9 boost cycles in a fight.
---
Both, really. It lets brawling fits shine at a greater range, and it allows for sniping fits as well. It's up to you to decide how you want to use those bonuses to your advantage.
---
For clarification:
---

---
First, you were right to use it to get some distance. Good strategy.
---
Second, the requirement for warp is that you're both pointed in the same direction and traveling at least 75% of your top speed. Because MWDs increase both your acceleration and your top speed, they usually don't end up making you warp quicker. When your MWD deactivates your max speed and acceleration go down to normal instantly, but your actual speed stays high for a while. So you can use a cycle of your MWD to get up to speed, then turn it off and enter warp.
---
Most ships can go from 0 to 75% in less time than a MWD can cycle, so this isn't useful. But if your ship accelerates very slowly, such that you can cycle a MWD before you would normally gst to warp, this can speed things up a bit. Note that a MWD can also make it hard to turn around, so make sure you're pointing in the right direction before turning around.
---
There's nothing you can really do against being bumped. In this situation. Fortunately it doesn't happen too often.
---
I wish you had been at EVE North as I would have taken it all. Just getting into the lore, even after playing for a year ish.
---
I can't even tell if this is a true statement or not
---
Love!
---
Please don't do what /u/kristallnachte is suggesting. If the player is actually interested in ganking you, logging is the worst thing you can do. They will get a pilot in a rookie ship and agress you.
---
Antigankers are homophobes - you heard it here first folks!
---
Same here, I have played off and on over the years.  
---
Had a corpmate point out that with POS's you can warp to them and send items to your inventory without docking.  Just right click and there is an option in the list.
---
Couldn't believe how many times I could have used it when dropping stuff and then heading back out for more.

And my point sailing over your head is that the bots are on the Internet, and thus have plenty of ways to communicate that do not involve CCP's servers.
---
So if using CCP's servers as the communications stream becomes a problem, ejabberd is right over there.
---
The answer is to remove skill injectors outright. They were a terrible idea.
---
Older post but it still checks out.  Been running salvage for a bunch of fleets and this always gets in the way.  Thanks!
---
Has anyone tried anchoring a citadel in there?
---
Do you have a section of the EULA to point to? Not to be a dick about it but I want to see where that is.
---
:Sobering:
---
//wait, we have a wrong ammo size variable?
---
No. This griefing tactic is designed by CCP for some unknown reason with no counter to it.
---
Don't waste your money on bounties, they're also useless by design.
---
Very scary! I have never fought a capital class ship before is it hard?
---
Evetard destroyed with facts and logic!
---
Imagine hiding behind a CONCORD flair.
---
Either or, but even nerfed caps won't make blops as competitive as other cloaky options.
---
Yes retention numbers, not subs. Sub are relevant for us to actually determine things.
---
Not saying anything against that. Ofc they wil have numbers. But the only real number we have are login numbers. And those are being pumped up by a login event. This is my only point. Doesnt matter what numbers CCP has if they dont share them. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Thing you dont get here is that retention numbers is an issue that CCP has enforced. You know what the single biggest impediment to that is? The idea of Eve being this hardcore game where everything hurts. Their refusal to actually make HS viable, their inability to create a clearer path for new players even after 16 years.
---
Im not CCP and Ive got far less knowledge of the game than many others but I can off the top of my head name several changes that would enable higher retention. Which is sad.
---
And also, you shouldnt be quick to dismiss what certain players are saying. CCP is the reason behind the changes that people keep wanting to revert. No local is just another step thats going to make the game worse.
---
Just give it time.

According to Cpubenchmark and the few hundred samples they got, a Ryzen 5 3600 has a single-thread score of 2852, and the Intel 9900K has 2898.

Similar, but said Ryzen is at Intel price divided by 2.4 :)
---
At nearly as the same cost than the 9900K, the Ryzen 7 3800X has a score of 3006.

You say it two posts down or something. But has it occured to you that people are in nullsec just because they are not based on WHs? That if people want WHs they can choose to go there but they havent?

I mean I really dont get it, people dont want WH living. Just accept it.

You'll learn when you're older, honey.

I see these in highsec all the time. I think they are trying to bubble the Trigs.
---
Map is deffntly outdated from vale Inc drone lands is panfam
---
Oh so it's a game design issue? I thought all this time you were implying it's a player issue. Glad we got that settled at last!
---
CVA is a high skill PvP alliance. Haven’t you ever seen their capital flesh DEMOLISH enemy vessels?
---
Based on the little info you've given, I'll be very surprised if you get a positive response. I used to run missions a long time ago, like most folks do when they first start, and after a while I learned that it wasn't worth the hassle of pulling-in all the wreck, emptying the junk, and salvaging what was left - it was more efficient to leave it all behind and start a new mission.    
---
Folks like that won't have any 'junk' to give you.    
---
The other folks... the ones who'll spend an hour emptying wrecks and salvaging every last scrap of metal...? I doubt they'd do all that, then dock-up and hand it to you.    
---
A better bet for you - if you really want all that stuff - is to find someone who runs missions, and doesn't bother to loot, and ask if they'll give you bookmarks for the loot locations so that you can dig through the wrecks yourself. It's not very glamorous though. You'd honestly be better served just putting up cheap market buy orders, and re-selling at a higher price.
---
Only useful reply in this thread.
---
  
---
OP, get a hyena or a daredevil, duel yourself, web your orca to max speed of fuckall, your warp out instantly.
---
Awesome. I was the same way first time seeing it. Remember they are about 18km long per the game. Think of that scale. I now own 2 and being in a cap fleet you lose a bit of hype over it, but sometimes I am gating a frigate and run across one and kinda go back to my old ways of being in awe.
---
Beat bet dude it to join a large alliance and offer buy back in bulk for like 10% less than jita. You compete with others trying to do the same thing. 
---
Also a lot of people just toss their loot in contracts for x% discounts all the time.
---
under the presented situation, all of that it true
---
not logging out isn't going to change that.
---
If they want to gank you, nothing you can do to change that.
---
recently broke into dread ratting. its been very fun and lucrative, and lets me blow up more ships in more stupid ways than ever. blackout is very fun when in null sec, and will be moving into our first house irl soon. life is currently great! hope everyone else is having a great time irl and in game too, or is on the path to better days for thise who aren't!
---
Yes, just like people are in lowsec because it isn't like nullsec.
---
Nobody ever implied anything else.
---
Do you have a meaningful point there?
---
It's a game design issue that only exists because of the player issue.
---
The game design issue is how to fix players. The players are the root cause of the issue.
---
A recharge fit Rattle can do it: [https://pastebin.com/kwEUfKfK](https://pastebin.com/kwEUfKfK)

Drop a depot and refit damagemods/recharge lows depending on the incomming damage.

1. be more appreciated 
---
2. Industry and mining 
---
Yeah sorry mate I don't think thats gonna work tbh. if you join Imperium you're just a n+1 dude especially if you're new. Sad to say that but its true - you should know what to expect! Also the market is stuffed and you need to compete with a lot of powersellers in Delve.
---
Apparently that's what it takes (took before blackout) to kill supers in Delve.
---
Shouldn't it take 4 smalls?
---
Welcome to hell.
---
Not all these tiny things are explicitly written in the EULA. It broadly forbids harassment and such. It's then the GMs that decide what constitutes harassment.
---
At a certain point excessive bumping without any other end goal should qualify for that, imo.
---
if you could let it run without the market open i would not mind
---
Join Karmafleet, follow the plan laid out by your forefathers. In 13 months you’ll be in your very own titan, spending fuel to kill some cruisers.
---
Incorrect. In this case he could bring an alt char and use the current bump vector as his warpout point, hoping that the Thorax is lazy and not changing his direction... he could try 1-cycling his MWD to get into warp... etc.

There is no reason to own more space. A single region supports their +30k players  and their main strengh is in the combined umbrella, all supercapitals in jumprange to each system. They would risk loosing ships by spreading out.
---
oof. you wouldn't say this in thera /s
---
I’ve been multiboxinging 4-8 chars in fleets for years now on a single monitor. You just need to have a good setup and be well versed in using hotkeys for maximum efficiency.
---
Tell me again why you think such a player would have an alt?
---
If you don't have any practical examples then it probably isn't against the rules. CCP is known to be lenient towards in-game actions, and for good reason.
---
just the ones in Amarr?

Or did you see one in action?

---
Oh, shit, the Orca is down to 550Mn? Nice.
---
&gt; A reworked inhibiter would allow people to consider fighting what they are engaging with, not “what can the enemy bring 10 minutes from now”. The system wide affect means it can be dropped off grid, more likely forcing a sub cap response to secure or contest the inhibiter before the capital assets can be brought in. 
---
So you want fast easy kills where help cannot arrive, and nullbears want safe swathes of space farmable in peace.  I think the real balance is somewhere in the middle.  Removing local is an interesting way of tackling the issues, however as you stated in your post it will ultimately result in more people hiding under super umbrellas to krab.  This should be an example of the other extreme is not always the answer.

---
Idk I’m sick of being nice
---
I merely said I doubted that due to CCP's focus on making EVE as unforgivable as possible. You seem to be taking things way too personally and escalating to direct attacks for no discernable reason.
---
That sounds like a you problem.
---
&gt;we went on cruiser roams for about a week without any 'gudfites'...   and any fleets that did come to meet us were so disproportionate in  quality (pirate cruisers, T3s) or quantity (like 5+ people to chase us 3  out of their sov).   
---
Were they just supposed to let you rampage through their space because you'd enjoy it more?
---
and yet you implied making ganking rorquals easier is bad because it will drive new players away.
---
NO
---
Not the worst post I’ve seen this month, it’s up there, but still not the worst.
---
yea that's the point, you actually have to try and find me. im not just constantly broadcasting my location at all times that anyone can see with minimal effort
---
If there isn't a 30 rorq player buying your plex what's the point of buying it in the first place? You may not like that segment of the playerbase but without them keeping demand and price for PLEX up pure pvpers would find it a lot more expense to pay for eve that way. And contrary to popular opinion not all krabs plex their accounts.
---
&gt; but we are lightyears away from it
---
we are 3,000-4,000 players closer to it than we were a week ago.
---
The wolf isn't bad, and it's speed certainly is a good bonus. However, it's damage and projection just can't beat the retribution's lasers, which can hit up to 50km with aurora. Using microwave at 40km, the retri's projection far eclipses the wolf's. While the wolf may have superior damage type and speed, it lacks projection and application.
---
What post does the living server come from?
---
To an extent. I don’t want kills to necessarily be easy; but I do want them to be possible. As you say there will always be extreme points of view. On one side you have the perfect safety, perfect intel, perfect support mechanics. On the other side I could certainly think of more onerous threats to the krabs; cyno jammers online instantly, they suppress existing cynos, capitals can’t apply to subcaps at all, etc.
---
I’m not trying to suggest these things as I also want to find a balance. If you want to have 10 rorquals in anomaly, perhaps you do need to sit 4-5 faxes, 3-4 supers in there with them to protect your economic assets and obtain the safety that currently exists.
---
For some reason the Bradley evolution video keeps coming back to my youtube suggestions 😀
---
:Jamal:
---
An exaggeration to illustrate the point there is no amount of dreads you can drop to successfully bypass 7 minutes of invulnerability.
---
Yup. I try and at least justify my reasoning behind the proposed changes.
---
True, but for those who want to improve the game we need to keep having discussions around what the community would like.
---
Its not that T3s are better than BLOPs at just a few things, its that T3s are very close in many regards while still being better at a few things. 
---
So while a BLOPs may be able to push out 1000-1200dps, a T3 can get 800-1000dps with weapons that apply better, a ship that is a fraction of the cost, much more agile and speedy, better lock speeds (possibly offset by BLOPs targeting delay, but who knows if that would stay or matter), unique bonuses to EWAR and nullification and such, and can have a tank fairly close to a BLOPs, better resist profiles, etc., etc. 
---
While I don't doubt people will try to use BLOPs for hunting, those folks are basically going to have to overcome all the drawbacks and downsides many aspiring solo BS pilots suffer from everywhere. It would be a great buff to BLOPs if they could fit covert cloaks, but they still have a long way to go before they come into the same arena as other options for hunting.
---
If you're interested in helping with translations you can head over to https://volunteers.eveonline.com/ The Loc team already does it and they are probably more than grateful for any influx in volunteers
---
I disagree that it’s not logical, as any guerrilla warfare campaign has demonstrated in history. I agree that a small group should never be able to destroy the larger groups keepstar, but an individual PvE ship (say a single Rorqual alone) should be able to be taken down by a small group.
---
Denied, they do not want more languages....
---
Meaning you guys are the pussies
---
If you fight in nullsec, you'll see capital fleets numbering above twenty. It's absurd.
---
Hmm that's stupid
---
i appreciate that a system named "itsyamil" exists
---
imagine someone being chased down by a bunch of bad guys and they've got him cornered  
---
then suddenly his 4.5m tall bro shows up and gives the bad guys a spanking, and says "it's yamil" after he's done
---
dumbass bad guys should have known better than messing with the friends of yamil smh
---
Sounds like you found one of the old COSMOS mission complexes.
---
It is not bannable, that is super clear. People bump constantly. CODE wouldn't exist if that was the case.
---
Killing excavators, not if the rorqual pilot is competent and paying attention. Same thing with killing a super or rorq, given the time to kill issues I raised above. 
---
Subcap ratters absolutely, and I think they are in a good place. 
---
Cloaky camping cannot shut down a region if there is no reasonable expectation of a follow up from the campers. The null sec blackout has demonstrated this. In addition, it also doesn’t allow small groups of players to achieve anything, as those “threats” require large numbers of people (such as a large bomber fleet). 
---
For example, if there are 10 Rorquals in a belt, and force projection / panic is removed, it may be possible for 10 people to get leshacks to kill 1, perhaps 2 of those unprotected PvE ships before help arrives.
---
If you dont mind me asking what dont you like about it. 
---
I could see some friends and I being interested.
---
It removes all the bullshit of roaming around fruitlessly. Getting blobbed on and/or trapped down a pocket. Etc. 
---
I'll admit it defeats a certain feeling to the size of the game and changes its, i guess, "core concept." The sandbox. 
---
If people didn't like doing it, they could opt out.
---
Was a thought i had at the tail end of work
---
With a few plex and injectors you too can be in a titan very soon!
---
That has never been a thing.
---
Where?
---
You have a strong point. I don't see much purpose in using a 2-3b ship instead of a 800m 800 dps proteus when I can get more people in the latter.
---
Warp interdiction and speed is important when probe hunting so I feel it would divide the niches between the two. I do however think having a ship that can jump and warp cloaked might wind up being a bit strong, however.
---
This is wrong and bad advice to someone. CCP have never said that ever.
---
If you continually follow someone that moves to different systems (and not just next system across) and continue to bump them, then can may be ruled as harassment on an individual case by case basis, but that is based on following them no matter what they do to try to avoid you.
---
Bumping someone for an extended period of time however is not griefing under CCP rules and there is no need to try to kill them or achieve anything from the bumping.
---
Well the prospect is typically used to fill this role - I'm just referring specifically to dropping ratting carriers.
---
Im not necessarily disagreeing with you here. But why should they be able to? I mean alot of people, especially during this no local event, has been screaming about how null needs to be hardcore. So why doesnt that rule apply to the rest of the game? Where and when does it make sense that a small group somehow affects a considerable larger amount of people?
---
And Inner Hell is a WH group right? They kill stuff on the regular, dont hear them bitching. They bring the right numbers, tactics and tools for the job. And Skillu manage to topple the east right? So it was never impossible, you just have to actually put in the work.
---
What I keep hearing is that a few people cant mess up alliances with thousands upon thousands of players. Why is the assumption that you should be able to?
---
IF WH logi is ez, Null are completely braindead to the point where a bot could do it.
---
neat.
---
Apply to Pandemic Horde in game. They’ll get you set up on guided new player ratting fleets, as well as about everything else.
---
CCP ruled otherwise years ago:
---
[https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/topic/199310/](https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/topic/199310/)
---
After deciding they would put a 3-minute warp timer into the game, which they never did, they updated the post to say their thinking had moved on, but that still stands currently as the only ruling that explains what might be regarded as harassment with relation to bumping, and it has nothing to do with excessive time.
---
The in-game corporation finder makes me want to jump into the sun, and Evejobs seems to be little more than false advertising and scamming.
---
What are some tips to help find a good corporation/group to play with in Eve?
---
Yes. 
---
I agree totally that the response will be to begin mixing in the supers and capitals to be on grid with the rorqs when they are out mining. Currently the bloc has their entire online super fleet ready to drop on any particular threat, regardless of where it appears. 
---
To demonstrate the principle with hypotheticals, mega bloc is mining in 20 systems with groups of rorqs. They have a decent sized fleet of 40-50 faxes / supers chilling around Netflixing. If a rorq is tackled by a group of 30-40 t3cs they light the cyno, hit panic, at as its expiring jump in 40-50 faxes and supers. Attackers go home sad having achieved nothing.
---
If we can find an acceptable way to remove / hamper force protection, those same 20 groups want to mix in the supers and faxes. Now each belt has 1-2 supers and a fax with them. The same 30-40 T3Cs have a chance of killing a fax, or a super, or a rorq in the time it takes the remainder of the fleet to make their way to the system. 
---
No, they still can’t kill them all, and they could easily get all destroyed as the defenders seal off the system, but they can inflict some damage for the risks they take.
---
Market values must be fucked too, cause the cheapest Orca on the market is 650 mil, and its in the middle of nullsec.
---
Picard facepalm.exe.The idea of small gang pvp is to fight bigger and stronger groups than your own and still win. Be that through  clever use of mechanics, better outright skill than your opponents or through sheer luck
---
"bullshit of roaming around fruitlessly" is what keeps things fresh. Never knowing what exactly you may face and ensuring you constantly have to adapt and show initiative to improve at the game. What you are proposing is nothing more than a glorified version of rock,paper scissors which is almost certainly "meh"
---
I think it's mostly decorative. It doesn't hurt anything.
---
Yup. I agree, it shouldn’t be possible to topple any mega bloc as a small group. It’s a really unfortunate parallel to draw, but yes let’s look at 9/11 as an example. A group of terrorists inflicted billions of dollars of damage (arguably trillions) on the US while still being a small group. 
---
A group of rorquals dying will never kill a null bloc either, but it certainly gives people the opportunity to fight over something.
---
oh, the remote cargo deposit thing? Yeah, that's newish - I think only a few months old now. Nice innit?

---
The official forums are decent. There at least you can get an idea of what they’re trying to be, requirements and can check zkill to confirm. 
---
The best way is to find a group by playing the game but that becomes difficult without a group to play with already. Sometimes you’ll end up in a fleet with a temp ally and you end up liking how they do things or the people. Or meet people through a NPSI fleet or run into somebody while solo roaming and so on.

Honestly I can understand why the devs are on crusade to kill all capsuleers.
---
Thanks for your response. I agree that a lot of this stems from different perspectives on what eve should be, which is why I’m happy to talk about things like this. 
---
My thought of eve was always the “dangerous” MMO where you could risk a lot and gain a lot. There was scammers, pirates, gankers and people looking to shoot you wherever you went. 
---
IMHO the idea of building trillions of isk in perfect safety is pretty anti-EVE, but I respect that others may want to play it that way.
---
My question would be, what’s better for the long term health of the game? It appears that everyone who complains about less safety and builds up their isk reserves for their third Titan then also complains about the stagnation that’s created from that style of play. 
---
When everything is unassailable, what good does all the isk you have do you?

You can mark what the ticker shows using the market quickbar folder option.  
---
Simply make a folder in the quickbar, add what you want to keep an eye on, right click on the folder and "Mark as your Market Ticker Folder".
---
I agree people shift towards capitals due to isk and pretty much isk alone. My primary concern was the EHP inflation that has come along with this increase in isk generation. Increased safety has come along as a byproduct of making more isk, and imho those things should be directly opposed. Lots of risk, lots of isk. 
---
Also, I want to make sure to point out I’m not looking to kill carrier and rorqual mining. People want to work towards big toys and they should be able to play with them. I just want there to be some risk associated with that increase in isk revenue.

fuck snuff!

The bounties are low, but I just calculated the loot I got from the relic and data cans. Between the Yan Jung stuff and the Serpentis artifacts I got about 45 mill worth of stuff when I ship it off to Jita. I had to hack a bunch of stuff for the COSMOS agent.

From what experience I have so far, playing solo just isn't viable at all. Lack of good structures, massive risk, no intel, and any attempts at PVP end with you getting gangbanged by 20+ ships at once. I'm not sure how someone would really manage to play the game without a huge group, since the complaints about everything devolving into N+1 seem to be fairly accurate, which is unfortunate, since I'm not real keen on being forced into Goons/TEST.
---
I was that way with boobs.
---
And then listen to a certain CSM and Dev complain about how you didn't do it right and are ruining the game.  haha
---
I liked them, they had spirit. They also fed a lot, but they had spirit.
---
Thanks for the response. 
---
In regards to “why should they be able to”, im assuming you’re generally referring to small groups.  This is a totally fair question, and I have two answers. 
---
First, I think it’s better for the health of the game. If you enable small groups of people to achieve things it allows people to be engaged and want to play. Even if those few people are part of a big null bloc they can get some friends together and go out and achieve (read: kill) without necessarily having to heard 70-90 cats into bombers. The lower the bar for the minimum number of people required to achieve something, the more accessible it is to the entirety of eve.
---
Second, i don’t think a small group should be able to affect a larger amount of people in the strategic sense. A small wormhole group should never be a threat to a keepstar. They should never be able to go toe to toe. My argument centres on the fact that if any group (not just wormholes) identifies a tiny ”unprotected” section of that large group, they should be able to engage and destroy it, not necessarily be forced to go toe to toe with the entire alliance. This time frame might mean they can only kill 20% of what’s on grid before being forced off, but at the moment that hovers around 0% due to EHP and force projection.
---
Skillu toppling the east is talking about a significant major nullsec power that could field 50+ titans, not anything remotely near what we’re talking about. Once more, it’s not about being able to destroy larger alliances, it’s being able to take out an individual weak member of the herd if they present themselves :)
---
My head hurts
---
What does the ability to control grid mean?
---
Dude, you are lost. I mean truly.
---
&gt;A ratting carrier will likely kill most blops with their fighters...
---
Thanks for the details.
---
ELI5
---
If I got this correct you think the fact many people don't want nullsec to be like wormholes means they shouldn't be, which isn't an actually good argument.
---
What's good for content isn't always liked by everyone. People will kick and scream through changes even if they are good for them.
---
Your argument appears to be a "because it is, thus it ought to be".

You could also Check out Unholy Knights of Cthulu. We are another corp in TEST Like dreddit tho much smaller

I think this qualifies you to have a twitch stream. GL

Afaik it’s based on the region you’re in. If you go to some abondoned area you won’t get proper prices.

i remember one of her funniest streams was she got pretty drunk i fell of my chair laughing.
---
You definitely don’t have to then but yes some things do get more difficult without the big groups. 
---
If I were you I think I’d look into a wormhole corp which is a lot less about n+1, a lot more roaming, wormhole fights are in much smaller groups and depending how good your group is with it running sites can be done moderately safely.

This was coming "next patch" about two years ago. Never happened, disappeared without further mention.

All these thread downvotes are from the same chucklefucks who think ruining your fun superceeds any notion that what they are doing might be a problem.

And the guys just in a orca out mining, not a freighter getting bumped so one guy and his 30+ alts can wack him. Nice to see some returning player gets the same treatment as anyone else, except if he's a pvp player.

Fleet doesn't do anything. A duel is needed, or being in the same corporation with legal friendly fire.

Bumping is a terrible one-sided mechanic with no counter. Not much that can be done really. Maybe some day CCP will create some counterplay to bumping, but until then you're stuck just suffering endless concord-less agression. The only real option is ganking them - which requires multiple alts and typically means you're spending much more isk than the target ship is worth so even if you "win" by destroying them you're losing more isk than they are.
---
Don't do bounties though, those are useless. TL;DR on that is that only a tiny bit of the bounty is handed out to anyone killing them, based on a small % of the value of the ship they lost. 1b bounty would take probably hundreds of billion in ship losses and not affect them in the slightest (except they get a kick out of the number on them, i guess).

Yes yes another day in Eve. You need projectile ammo no no not that projectile ammo.
---
No thanks. This one of the few elements that gives FW its flavour. Thematically, it's supposed to be a war; so there's nothing unreasonable about being shot on sight by the enemy - even if they're NPCs.    
---
I don't see why FW would suddenly thrive with life if this was removed; if this is the only thing keeping someone from enjoying FW, I reckon they're kidding themselves.

Wouldn't need the planet back of we didnt rebel.

No, stop putting instanced bullshit in my sandbox.

It doesn't. You just need to be on your toes - or shop with an alt.

Holy crap, Coronaries are down to 100k?  Excavs must be falling off a cliff.  Those things used to be like 5m.
---
They can fix it with lore and the mass warping space time and flexing on the ships hull or warp core or causing excessive heat to the area reducing resistance there’s all kinds of things they can do to slow down the cap blobs.
---
Is a shame that they arent as rare as they used to be. Seeing a Titan was hype back in the 00's. Now its just another ship.

Oh to be new again. I envy you OP.

ok

You... Can't be a real person

[removed]
---
The Russian bots are learning.
---
You really hate the idea that someone new could break into Null Sec. NPC Null Sec is a critical staging area for adding risk to sovereign space.  It’s a training wheels area for newer groups. It’s a haven for beaten groups. It’s a lily pad for groups to travel deep into null without blueing everyone on the potential supply route. And you want to eviscerate it by preventing capitals from docking there. That’s just crazy, man.
---
Eve needs more NPC stations, not to nerf the ones we have.
---
if you need help setting up your multi-dollar media empire shoot me a pm
---
And in term the people that ground out their money can continue to play the game without putting any money into the system because someone else paid for their month's bill.  In the end it all comes around; someone plays for free because someone's whaling incredibly hard.
---
And Falcon said above that he wouldn’t let capitals dock in NPC stations. So you couldn’t even really store or transport anything anyway. He would literally kill the 0.0 and low sec game for everyone except Goons and anti-Goons.
---
Sure... But the PLEX was still bought and paid for with real dollars. At some point CCP gets money for every character, whether that be you paying via a subscription or someone buying PLEX with real dollars and then selling them/you buying that PLEX with ISK.
---
Did you have a mining permit?

I'm not sure how the same old same old every day day in and day out is 'keeping it fresh.'

---
real person my friend she stopped streaming for a bit due to her daughter you can see her daughter in the middle of her emotes :)

I assumed the reason for the hold was to stash ships to defend yourself with.i always keep a couple battleships in my orca. Weird that the rorq doesn't let you :(

What people often do is go to hisec systems with level 4 security agents and place low-ball buy orders for mission loot (mostly meta modules). A lot of these don't really sell well, so why do they do it? Well, because they often sell less than their mineral cost.
---
So for example, you might have a meta (named) module that sells for 500k in Jita, but if you reprocess it you could get minerals worth 800k. You could put up buy orders in the mission systems for 400k, haul the modules to jita (much less volume needed when it's a module), reprocess them there (you'll need some skills and standings to be effective) and dump them on the market. There are tools that calculate profit margins automatically for this thing, like Evernus. It will give you an eve login window, pull your skills to calculate refining rates, then you can load the prices for specific regions and have it tell you which modules are profitable to reprocess this way.
---
i'll thrust my fists against your posts and still insist you see the ghosts

Yeah, same thing in small gangs, where you've got that orthrus/hyena shit screening tacklers off.

---
I never ran missions when I was in FW, but I don't see any need to take them away from the folks who do; just make the risk commensurate with the risk. CCP already have a new AI, as exemplified by the Drifters and Trigs - just use that.
---
While I'm here, I hear people complain that system-control became largely irrelevant with the advent of Citadels; well, CCP have a structure-bashing AI that never gets bored. You want to tear down your enemies' structures, then fight to flip the system and control it long enough for Navy fleets to start harassing the hell out of them. It doesn't have to be as insane as the Drifter AI was in Null, but it'd certainly go a long way towards livening things up.
---
On that subject, what are the current rewards for 'holding space' for the Empires? Last time I checked, it was something like lower taxes, or industry costs in the NPC stations. If that's still the case, I'm not feeling any draw...
---
Old grudge/beating a long-dead horse... despite all these pilots fighting the Empire's proxy wars in Lowsec, there's no impact of that on Hisec. Maybe it's finally time to change that. There'd be a unscaleable mountain of salt if Galmil retook the warzone and the Caldari megacorps were 'forced' to raise Hisec's taxes to fund their fleets, but I'd be all for it...
---
was already posted sry
---
No the whole point of the rorqual was to boost the effectiveness of mining barges.  So with the bay you could load up your whole mining fleet and jump to the location everyone was going to mine in.  Fit the clone bay to it and everyone could jump clone to the rorqual grab their ships and go mining.  At least that was the intended use for it.
---
What is liberty squad?
---
My ceo is super paranoid, and even he has us leave eve-scout can in our system alone.
---
We help lost folk too, but we get them out via medical clone, with advice and sometimes some isk.
---
You seriously think those that run the bots don't keep close eye on the income? It's literally the one thing they care about in EVE. 
---
I wouldn't be surprised if the damned things are programmed to blast alert notices all over the place if their ticks start dropping by a certain percentage.
---
Still not enough, base cargo bay in Venture is 50m3, and there's only 1 low slot, so you'd also need t2 cargo rigs, and that's just too fancy for a tankless cyno frig.
---
I get what you are saying. But look at it from the other perspective. People join bigger groups for a lot of reasons, one being safety. Just like in real life. Doesnt mean that they cant be killed but important things like Rorqs and supers will be defended. And if it was too easy for you to do it then the entire ship lineup will stop being used. Look at excavators right now, they arent being used since there is no counter to bombing them.
---
Its like in every other game and irl, if you dont have the right gear (right setup) then it doesnt really make sense that you should be able to kill ships much more expensive than yours. You wouldnt be upset if you couldnt 5 man a 20 man raid in WoW would you?
---
Honestly, some things shouldnt be able to be killed my smaller groups and people join big groups to be able to kill them. So one has to make a decision, do you want big kills or are you content with smaller. But its your choice, not mine or anyone elses. And likewise its the choice of the person flying the bigger thing if they wanna pay the price of it, i.e., being just another member in a big alliance.
---
But I hope you understand that I am talking with respect here, I love small gang, probably the most fun aspect about any game and in Eve in particular. I really want you guys to be around because you make the game more diverse, but I dont think the compromise is to make you overpowered. I dont know what is needed for you guys to have more fun but I think some of the solution lies in the acceptance from small gangs that there are things you cant kill without atleast temp bluing other groups.
---
Not if you get about 3 logi legions with armor/info links on grid.

skilling spree. killing rats for sp is a step in the right direction
---
you can, but everything will still be 0.00-.0.05 so its still worthless data
---
Yes, it is.  If it were not, next to no games would be pay to win, because in even the grindiest of asian MMOs you can technically get everything for free/with in game currency, it would just take a ridiculously long time.  EVE has enough nuances that a strictly better ship doesn't always win, unlike in some games, but the pay to win boat has definitely long sailed.
---

---
&gt;Reply
---
Enjoy the upvote
---
You present really good ideas. I perhaps didnt make it known that I like what you are saying. Especially the above. Right now NS feels like we have isk but no real content. 
---
But I have to point one thing out, I rat because Im bored and it gives me a feeling of meditation if that makes sense? Its calming to just kick back and focus on nothing but a game for a while. Miners prob feel the same. For me PvP is upwards so I do that when Im too down so to speak. Others are quite the opposite, PvP calms them whilst PvE stresses them. Thats one thing that has to be remembered and respected, people are different and if we want a good game then we have to adapt to both. 
---
But this meta, the Rorqual meta, took it too far. We have been complaining, me personally for several years, that this isnt good. Its become an arms race and if you fall behind then you might not have sov in a couple of months. So every group has tried to adapt to ensure higher and higher amounts of supers/titans because CCP thought that meant bigger fights and better marketing. On the ground it became more and more evident that nobody would risk more just because they had more since the other side also had more. And what we see today is that Delve has won the cold war and become a superpower that can crush any group.
---
So my opinion isnt that Eve should be more dangerous or hardcore because thats what always made the game a bit to niche which we can in retention numbers. I would rather that CCP stops the arms race and never does anything like that again. Right now it would be better for the game if capitals became stronger and more expensive whilst supers and titans just get removed. That way people will fight in caps since they dont cost an arm and a leg but it will be something wow to see. Plus other change ofc.
---
But then we are dropping too much? And people wanna nerf cynos. You realise that we cant win in any way right? The situation is that we are cunts no matter.
---
And its your perception that cows dont belong in NS. I like milk so Im of another opinion.
---
As in, you eventually got them?
---
Boosting another side isnt the same as nerfing your side. You can still kill up to carriers with relative ease even under an umbrella, you just cant kill rorqs and supers. But who ever said that you should.
---
do you see my post on the forums ?
---
could you let me know thanks i dont seem to see it
---
Dude, NS was part of the people complaining. Why wouldnt we be? We are the ones who actually fight these things on a regular.
---
is this the thing ccp specifically says isn't allowd?
---
Seriously, it just makes the market a little bit brighter and a bit more immersive.
---
No its not. Makes very little difference honestly.
---
Nope
---
Caps cant kill small gangs the way you present it man. If you stick around too long sure but you can always disengage. Takes a shitlong time for caps to do the same. And ultimately nobody forces you to be on grid with something bigger. I mean you wouldnt take on a BS in a frig yet people expect that cruisers against capitals should be ok.
---
Not a good mechanic, but literally awesome. Amazing and scary. Bad game design, though.
---
Can't log off safely when targeted.
---
Corp buyback at 90% jita. I'll pass.
---
Yeah they are nice too. They've let me join a fleet or two of theirs and seemed like chill dudes.
---
I see your point. Sure awesome in that sense, but absolute shit for the game.
---
&gt; I've never seen a Titan, but this one was very very big. How can people control these things. I was like an ant compared to the Titan. 
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Oh yeah no, screw that noise.
---
You keep saying content. And you keep forgetting that you want content for a small procentage at the cost of fking over a much larger part of the pop. Theres something wrong with that picture.
---
You got it correct, because its different playstyles and people opt in to one or the other. Why should you or anyone else feel the need to change that? Nobody is telling you what do to right? Yet you feel the need to tell others. Thats childish.
---
And also, people will hail changes that arent good for them aswell. Literally one of the things human beings are known for, fucking themselves over in the long run because of instant gratification.
---
My argument is, if it aint broke, dont fix it. If you want more content, fine, lets fix that without wrecking for the bigger group. The analogy right now is that society would all of the sudden start adapting to the criminals, the smaller more belligerent groups at the expense of the ones that hold up the economy and everything else.
---
Why the fk would a society do that? And what real criminal would expect that? Thats why you dont see the succesful small gang groups sitting here arguing for things like no local, its just the shitty groups and individuals who want to do big boi stuff without having to do big boi work.
---
No he wanted to fly them
---
Exactly.
---
&gt; My argument is, if it aint broke, dont fix it.
---
Well, some don't agree with you that it's not broke. That's the Crux of the issue.

You are excelling in your new found art bill...... good shit poast A+

nothing wrong with that....sad CCP couldnt keep the valuation on par.

Hrm. I thought if you didn't have docking rights it didn't populate there
---
We have AoE doomsdays now....with a lot more of them.

You can just ignore it if it is pointless info, but if it exists, it will occasionally alert you to big swings in something weird that you would otherwise not have noticed
---
And they are not even remotely similar to the AoE doomsdays that he was talking about.
---
Intel has always been much more expensive and still somehow managed to ensure a lot of brand loyality. Admittedly after my past experiences with Phenom CPU's personally i also am one of the people that prefer Intel. It's very possible that Ryzen CPU's do much better than past AMD products but i can imagine that theres quite a few people that aren't really interested in experimenting.  
---
PS: [For it being a "fact" it looks like Intel is still pretty far from dying](https://www.statista.com/statistics/735904/worldwide-x86-intel-amd-market-share/)
---
Make it so strong that destroying it would require sacrificing 100s of titans and supers. It should have XXL bombs with large aoe and each dealing 1 mil hp damage. It's the ultimate citadel and should be incredibly op. Killing it should be the biggest bloodbath in the history of EVE.
---
The most important thing to do while streaming is to maintain engagement. Follow the 3 second rule (no silence for longer than 3 seconds). It doesn't really matter what you're talking about. Though it's generally best practice to be saying something relevant to what you're doing.
---
It'll be found in &lt;24 hrs. Thousands of players visit all wormholes everyday. And all explorers have have the system map open whenever they jump into a new wormhole.
---
just make sure &gt;50% of your stream is actual content, not just idling in station like most eve streamers
---
never implemented, for good reason.
---
I'm pretty sure it's in fountain somewhere...
---
No problems at all my dude :) I hear what you’re saying as well.
---
I disagree with a few minor things, I think excavators are still being used plenty, although bombers are forcing people to be not quite as afk with them. The counter of course being to pull them when the bombers decloak. 
---
I do agree with the aspect that there is, and should be, content that the exclusive domain of large blocs. Strategic level goals such as large sov warfare, killing of keepstars, super / Titan battles are all examples of this. 
---
I disagree that some of these changes would necessarily make any small gang over powered. There would certainly be solutions to maintain the level of safety that currently exists - but it would come at a greater cost. 
---
I suppose our differences might be highlighted by the following hypothetical.
---
During the blackout you are warping around in delve. You see a single rorqual in an ice belt, and no other people are on dscan. Warping around the system and checking citadels, you can see he is actually totally alone. 
---
Ideally in the perfect eve world; 
---
1. Do you think you should be able to kill this ship?
---
2. How many people do you think you should need to bring to successfully kill this rorq?
---
3. How much isk do you think you should need to commit to the field to do so?
---
I’ll then ask the same three questions and ask your estimate for what the figures currently are.
---
good point. I never idle. I plan my day so that streaming is 100% jumping in a ship and looking for content.
---
I use it on my focused folder. Good to have some daily clue

---
[Yes](https://www.eveonline.com/article/regarding-afk-complex-farming-1), this is considered an exploit
---
that ruling is dated, and pretty much says "you can do it as long as you're able to do it" which is real dumb
---
Clearly structures just need a jump drive to fix this problem.
---
Go back to the drawing board.
---
NO. NO NO. NOOOOOOOOO
---
For sure. I can totally appreciate that different people enjoy different things. It is a sandbox and no one playstyle should be *totally* dominant over the other. Ratters should have a chance to fairly defend themselves, and hunters should have a chance to fairly kill them. 
---
I’ve got a slightly different take on the arms race, but do agree that is largely what is happening (or rather happened, goons won it). The driving force behind the accumulation of titans and supers is because *that* is the way you win. Bar some minor tactical decisions such as ranges to engage at, etc, the deciding factor is how many bums you can get into the Titans. 
---
This stems from the fact that you simply can’t damage the null blocs in any other way. The force projection they hold means that you *have* to fight their super fleet whenever you go into their space to achieve anything. There is no current ability to hit supply lines, economic activity, or anything else because of the issues I raised above. 
---
Let’s face it, Titans and supers are never being removed. I’m just hoping to provide some small viable alternatives to inflicting (limited) damage on any group regardless of size. This should hopefully give an avenue outside strictly n+1 in the largest ship size possible, and bypass the end result of the arms race. This also means that small groups of people can go and achieve some modest goals, which again brings more content availability to everyone.
---
Good point, forget that the alt I use is in same corps.
---
OH MY GOD! THAT\`S A TITAN! 
---
Sweet! Sweet!

Welcome to EVE!

Now: salvage -&gt; inject -&gt; rorq/super -&gt; inject -&gt; TITAN!

thats still like 15% below jita
---
It still gives you an isk snapshot, which is most of what will matter to a trader who has an item he's familiar with in his ticker folder.
---
It helps region to region traders to keep an eye on hot items as they pass through (since it pulls from the regional market).  As you trade a lot, you become familiar with the prices enough that the price is all the info you really need.
---
You still primarily rely on sources like Eve trade to find trades, but the ticker isn't a terrible way to keep an eye out for deals on your way to other places.  Frankly, I'd use it more if it could pop out from the market window.
---
[laughs in space french HONHONHON]
---
During some Burn Jita events we had like 3-4 fleets and 10+ targets ... so, some freighters had to be bumped like 2h before it was their turn to be ganked.
---
I have no idea. I just found it last night by accident when doing a COSMOS mission. I warped into the complex only to be greeted by a planet sized blob of wrecks and a lone Ishtar = Drones just constantly farming bounties.
---
Raw damage isn't everything. In fact the number on your fitting window is only a theoretical maximum: not your actual damage output.
---
Resists are very important, and a prepared projectile weapon (or missile) user can adjust their damage output to the situation at hand. Easy to do in PvE, harder in PvP, but devastating if done right.
---
Then there's application. Lets take a frigate duel for example. You've got a Gallente blaster boat and I've got a Minmatar projectile boat. If I am faster than you I will win every time because I can do my damage further out than you can do yours. Even if we're evenly matched on speed I might be able to win the DPS race to the death in a close brawl if I correctly guessed your resist hole and loaded ammunition to exploit it. 
---
Don't get me wrong though. I love blasters (rails are okay, but I prefer missiles for long distance - beams if I'm doing turrets). They're not the magical silver bullet you make them out to be though.
---
Lvl 3... injectors are bad M'kay
---
That's really good advice dude. Never noticed that. I'll try and do that
---
Not a lot of hulls can do that and have the mids to fit the full tackle needed to make blasters effective. 
---

Don't care.

I saw my first Titan as He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named decided.... Actually not it was a DBRB bridge into a Band of Brothers double aoe doomsday. At least we DD tanked our BS.

If they have all that setup and executed properly, they deserve the kill.

I’ve joined a few corps other than Pandemic Horde, I’m actually a wormholer btw now. I can’t really give a specific guide, beyond not being afraid to leave a group you don’t like. 
---
I’ve joined groups that I thought would be great that i ended up bored and doing nothing, and my current Corp is a wormhole group I’d never heard of until they recruited me. 
---
I guess my advice is just to try out different groups until you find one you like.
---
Oh boy. The Thrasher is a neat little ship. So many possibilities. Most of them nefarious.
---
Artillery fit to suicide gank covops frigates fishing for Sisters Probe Launcher drop (best done with a buddy and a neutral character to scoop up loot after the police kill you). High-dps, low-tank Faction Warfare brawling. Get some buddies all fit up in brawly thrashers and go off to anywhere and be far more dangerous than you have any right to be in a gang of 3 million ISK ships.
---
Good ship indeed.
---
&gt;  Skill injectors that can be used without discretion ( there's should be a monthly limit on how many of those you can use )
---
How about something along the lines of an addiction mechanic? Inject too much too often, and you could wind up learning slower without that fix. Maybe you start blacking out, and bonuses from random nonessential skills don't apply until the blackout ends. And then to break the addiction, you have to stop injecting altogether until the withdrawal effects wear off. But if you get addicted again, you're likely to be affected to the same extent or worse than the last time.
---
Yep.  They are too good.  Why have your main in fw fighting the opposition when you have just have a fucking alt run missions for both sides year round and keep your main neutral?
---
You can't make people do pvp.  The mission runners will just farm their alts.  It's been brought up MANY MANY TIMES and it's fucking retarded how people think they can force the communist RMT bears into pvp.  They.  Will.  Just.  Farm.  And.  Kill.  Their.  Alts.
---
something like this was actually pretty fun in albion
---
Try relogging, see if that fixes it

Subs and logins are down why do you think they are throwing SP at us?  You think inflating logins with free SP is to help pad the numbers even more because the \~BLACKOUT\~ is doing such a great job for the health of subs?  Nope.  
---
CCP is merely trying to get people to login so their overlords don't see how many people have walked away from the game in the last month.
---
Eve has tons of great helpful features like this, and it only takes a few years to learn that most of them even exist. A few more years and you may even remember where most of the ones you know about are located.
---
Also, the ammo will have a letter on the icon and in the name to tell you what size it is. S, M, L, and C (Not sure on the capital-class, haven't seen any yet.)
---
That's because it's being removed.

Liked so much the first time I saw them, I built my own.

&gt;non-consentual pvp

&gt;nullsec 
---
Pick one.
---
Being able to permabump is beyond stupid. No one should be able to stall for forever while they wait for things to be 'perfect' for them to aggress. Shit or get off the pot.
---
Couldn't they be sent through a wormhole or something.. ?
---
Don't do this.  Always fit an Orca for Max tank in highsec.  A higgs rig will do nothing for bumping.  Pretty sure just a troll.
---
Skill injectors are the biggest factor for super proliferation.
---
don't fly the one ship type susceptible to bumping unescorted moron
---
It’s obvious that you shouldn’t be in nullsec. Go to lowsec and highsec then. 
---
The next thing eve should do is remove asset recovery from nullsec. Then you’ll see which group has the biggest balls.
---
Just make it not show. Best way to tell CCP that you don't care about it.
---
The precentage data is completely useless. I'd rather just see it be removed altogether.
---
Very well done !
---
&gt; I mean you wouldnt take on a BS in a frig
---
Faction/AF frig vs missile/long ranged guns BS, sure you would. Orbit, kill their few drones. Sure, these days they can have grapplers, MJDs, easier fitting of a utility neut, but plenty of PvE BSs have died to 1 or 2 frigs.
---
You talking about orcas or mining barges? Or are you talking about freighters? Or are you talking about certain battleships? or capitals?
---
you dont get the ingame items. it gets applied to your account.
---
you dont seem to have taken the time to actually read his post.
---
I got a invite to some gay cowboy channel at some point, if you’re not too particular you might want to seek that out.
---
Think about having a delay. Not having one will make people hunt you but that can also be great (and very entertaining) content.
---
Skill Injectors made every poor decision they made worse by magnitudes.
---
&gt; MPTC arrived. Neither in item form nor directly applied to account (I believe it is not supposed to be in item form).
---
''i believe'' doesnt mean ''i know''.
---
Things have been pretty patchy with her lately.
---
Tried that.  It won't allow me to start it on my second character.
---
'freighters', orca being a freighter
---
battleships and barges can fit to negate bumping completely and easily
---
nope...fake news
---
If its applied to account try logging in another char on account and start training.
---
Any update on how we can farm skillpoints for npc kills?
---
Controlling a titan is not really different from controlling a frigate. Just more hitpoints and DPS and less velocity.
---
They do, vacations man, but well worth it.
---

---
#ThetKnewThisWouldHappen
---
Thanks but as stated in other replies, I've already tried that
---
Capital is XL :)
---
as a guy who spends all day in highsec, this is untrue unless substantiated with evidence
---
Would love to see BLOPS be able to fit Command Bursts.
---
A Covert cloak would be cool aswell, but a reduction in Micro Jump Drive reactivation (What the Marauders have) would be nice aswell. 
---
Also give Nestor a jumpdrive with BLOPS range so it can jump with BLOPS. :D
---
Worked perfectly fine for me. Not items, but could see the available training slot under Character Sheet &gt; Pilots Services. Then just hit start button on the second char.
---
that's why it's imperative that 100% safety isn't possible via perfect intelligence

dont worry... by the time you manage to fly one, all the capital-haters will have nerfed them even harder.
---
I feel personally attacked
---
This is a pretty good but OP's name makes me want to die.
---
Horrifying.
---
Why people dont understand this way :'( , why people do not understand that in a sandbox you play as you want and that there is no logic to play as everyone has a game or you can be whoever you want.  Because apart from the twins that looks like no human thinks really the same way .
---
Sounds like we need to take away local in highsec too than hmm?
---
just partition it
---
One of the devs must've came up with this market ticker idea and was so damn proud of his ingenuity that he absolutely insists it remains not only in the game but is on by default
---

---
there is two in two minutes
---
if i recall right, to just ram you to annoy the fuck out of you for a prolonged time is a breah of rules and a punishable offence, so partition it, preferably film it or screenshot it multiple times with a few minutes between the screenshots and then give the evidence to the GM handeling the partition.
---
&gt; You can still kill up to carriers with relative ease even under an umbrella
---
No you cannot. 9/10 a carrier will light a cyno as soon as they are tackled and a super/fax/titan group will drop in, even sometimes a titan bridge of ram jags. This is wrong, and don't pretend that this happens.
---
Shhhh, we are the stealthiest alliance in game, dont give our location away!
---
Good point. I've been leaving the delay off and moving in a fast ship to kinda sorta avoid snipers. Thann you.
---
but did you actually buy the MPTC?
---
Its not just buy 3 months get MPTC, it's buy 3 months and get MPTC for $1.
---
You don't mention actually buying the MPTC.

Wonder what corp this guy is in
---
No not really. You say it like its instant. Ofc it all depends on where and when and who you tackle but you are arguing that people will just blindly jump supers and titans in without actually knowing whats on the other side. 
---
Im not saying that it doesnt happen but burning down a carrier isnt that hard, its not a super. A ratting carrier goes down fast, more often faster than any response fleet can respond to. But ofc, if you tackle a carrier with a couple of ships and you are surprised that a response fleet can react then.. 
---
And if it really was 9/10 then barely any carriers would die in the game.
---
Moot point when they're all running Abyss

Did you actually subscribe through the promo that included the MCT or buy a regular 3 month extension?
---
I can relate. One time i was baked out of my mind. Was a slow day on Eve so me and the bois hopped on some pubg. When we do this we switch to discord so we don’t have to use push to talk. I forget about this. And proceed to beat box multiple times. Was totally embarrassed
---
I remember that feeling, it was good feeling.
---
&gt;&gt; but we are lightyears away from it

---
&gt;we are 3,000-4,000 ~~players~~ Accounts closer to it than we were a week ago.
---
Dude you cant compare a PvE BS to a PvE carrier. Subcap PvE has active tank with high resists whilst PvE carrier will always be rocking buffer simply because its a capital ship. Not to mention weapon systems and so on.
---
But fits arent what I was referring to, rather that you dont fight things bigger than yourself. Usually.
---
They should make a next level for ships, like what a Titan is to a frigate.
---
congratz. you found a guy that mande 3 new chars!
---
I miss them.  No they weren't very good, but they were always down for a scrap, which is more than I can say for pretty much any other galmil group i've encountered recently.

 [Apollo Tyrannos](https://zkillboard.com/character/3019582/) Wants to know Your Location In Highsec

And huge resist holes and barely stable. Easy to crack so long as you can deal with their damage application to your smaller ship.
---
Meh , I went hunting in frt space and other spaces in null ... it is a ghost space , the most content I got out of this blackout is dropping my dreadnaught haw on small gangs that think that the mega alliances are just going to sit idle and let you kill those supposedly full of prey space there is at current time and present.
---
Most hunter I c or roamers, small or medium size gangs comes to die in another hunter hands.
---
The only way I support blackout is temporarily, I do agree this is a critical blow against botters, 
---
I’m down for a ones in a while purge ... 
---
Use some well earned isk I pve,d and pvp with style , either solo , cloacky, blobs, roaming , small gang , major fleets , I do em all , except for abyss pvp , There’s just so much to do ... 
---
Oh and I don’t mine , I tried it trust me .... I just can’t do it....  I need pew pew .
---
All eve needed saving from was the bots and I dare to say skill injectors that was just fuel for the botters , 
---
Skill injectors also creates inflation due to now there is more pilots able to do the same task quickly , like FRT mega isk bot farm china shop.
---
CCP FF,d up with skill injectors imo.
---
Had to mess with the core fundamentals and now we messing with yet null sand box player base experience, blackout local.... yet  another fundamental.....tsk.
---
" nullbears have become highsec carebears "
---
They always were the same.
---
Wait so this place defends 45 cloaky camping alts cause "muh sandbox" but loses their shit if someone rats or mines because that's not the way the game should be played lmao
---
We aren't blue to goons, we just got sick of defending our sov against them.
---
Lol so basically get rid of eve , get rid of super , titans , carrier and dreads and game is fix ..... durrrrr :P
---
No local was never the issue. It wasnt broken no matter how many times its chanted. A lot of other stuff is broken. People have conflated the issues and presented it in one tangible way. Foregoing the fact that people dont want WH living and that shouldnt be a bad thing. Its okey if people dont want the thing they opted into suddenly start morphing into something else.
---
But if NS was to be nerfed in a relevant matter then ye great. What started this Rorq meta is just that, Rorqs. If you wanna revert the changes, then simply fix the Rorq. Dont start to change ten different mechanics with ten different outcomes you cant calculate. Just change the one thing you are after.
---
Rorquals.
---
Dont start using WHs as a model to reshape NS because people are not going to like it. And thats gonna drive people away. For no other reason than "uuh if u dont like it move to HS because eve is supposed to be dangerous", i.e., hate for another playstyle.
---
&gt;I had turned the mic on the auto setting too that night, so I didn't have to a hold a key or anything, which is really uncommon since they usually have strict rules about that.
---
Sick bastard.
---
Im not arguing against any of these things dude. It was never a discussion about fits.
---
So a lowsec alliance you are blue with and then 3 dead wormhole alliances. Got it.
---
He did that but as is the customer with CCP they are dragging their heels with the ticket.
---
Totally agree, but whataboutism stops any change from happening at all
---
All of them.
---
That's actually the best way to frame it.
---
No
---
&gt;I mean you wouldnt take on a BS in a frig yet people expect that cruisers against capitals should be ok.
---
This is what you said &amp; I disagree with.
---
BS &amp; BCs vs Capitals, yeah caps applying well is ok. Cruisers should be naturally too small &amp; fast for capitals to apply to. Is ok for dreads (HAWs can be seen, dreads don't exactly tackle you fast, etc). Carriers &amp; current fighters are a different problem.
---
They were in Highsec before they moved to nullsec, they've just journeyed back to the safest area to make money in the game, now that there is palpable risk in nullsec again.
---
Exactly but there is only one way I support this if it’s temporary long enough to starve all botters heck make it a dedicated botter hunting event all local blackout...  to point that all active alliances just focus on afk and bot hunts, especially china shop bots , can only go so long without making cash ... it will kill the botting industry eventually I hope.
---
Maybe he’s just talking about Maori (New Zealand native) [poi](https://youtu.be/7GXAapbacBc) in which case pounding the poi is basically appropriate...
---
the old mantra "bigger is not necessarily better" has been destroyed. Now warfare is about who can bring the most supers on field and enough titans to oneshot the other ones before they die.
---
Subcap warfare is basically dead in large scale null battles
---
Bots need to end ...
---
What ever they are i want some
---
Queef zero^tm
---
It makes pussies become louder
---
Would you allow implants?
---
Youve stated a way of dictating overall fleet xomp by mass. This would result in very specific comps being more common than others. Perhaps a 'the more of a ship type that enters (each month, each session, unsure) that hull is further restricted (in AT can only have 2 of any hull). 
---
Would you see the agency panel being used to tell you a team as 'applied' to enter. How much info would be available for this panel 'who iniatiated, who has entered, what hulls?' How much info is avaiable to the team that is under time pressure to enter v the team that prepared before they initiated the instance.
---
What stops me having my fleet comp, and my buddies wnter as the opposing side in unfit hulls to just die and let me take the LP?
---
Conceptually, i like the idea. I also liked the concept of the the abys PvP...less so on what it has become.
---
you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about, pls dont embarass yourself
---
The no local thing has been a much talked about solution for the last decade of problems in nullsec, not just since the rorq changes.
---
It was a solid change. The perfect Intel system local  was didn't make sense in nullsec
---
I mean the 00's was a decade ago.
---
Even without skill injectors etc, there will be more titans now than then, since players are older and richer. I've personally only seen one or two player titans in the game, and a couple of NPC ones, it's still an event for many players.
---
This is really good advice and very helpful. Thank you. I have a good web cam otw via Amazon now. Something I think I have going for me is I dont get sour about losses or kills. I'm very the thankful when a region gives me content. Sometimes I suicide and the shit on me, sometimes I kill a bunch of them and I leave a "gf". Either way I am happy. Timopotamus is my stream name. I've got some recents stored there.
---
How many titans do you have? The narrative that everyone has injected 6 of their alts to a titan makes no sense. 
---
The vast majority of players do not have one, or even a super, as it should be
---
Sadly u dont get certificates.. Oh well i guess its time for another alt XD
---
I too, keep my transversal high in order to speed/sig tank in my titan
---
Wow you found a whole 3 gilas in highsec?! Unbelievable
---
An orca with mwd warps in one mwd cycle. Warp to target, mwd on, mwd off. If he doesn't bump you for those \[I believe\] 10s you are gone. Keep trying that. 
---
Also if you mwd towards your warp target it will be harder for him to take you out of alignment for more than 25% of your speed (which should be around 300m/s) so once you are full speed ahead he should not be able to de-align you enough for you to not be able to warp off. Even more so if you stop mwd and now 75% of your speed should be like 70m/s and you are going 200 more or less directly towards your target.
---
I doubt anyone wants to be like Pax lmao
---
I know people say that would kill living in WHs once and for all, but every time we say that people live in WHs anyway. It would effectively ruin QoL of doing so though. What would be the point? You couldn't extract out to sell or buy anything unless you just roamed all of k space looking for your hole. Day tripping would essentially end, going one hole deep is pretty boring. Wormholers wouldn't get to pick fights with temp neighbors anymore, only shoot the people that wander into their hole, which as previously mentioned would probably be almost nobody. Youd have significantly less threat living inside a hole as holes would no longer connect to each other. I guess it would make wh hyper crab territory with the only downside being the IMMENSE pain of extracting your blue loot and gas.
---
Seems far less dangerous to me but whatevs.
---
i already know swings because I use adam4eve which has a differential at different periods, not just a one day or whatever worthless one the in game one shows.
---
Lets put it like this. We shall see.
---
You dont have time man. Excavs are superslow. If they are at the far end of a rock and you are just 1-2km from the rock they will be dead. They are being used but much less and less, prices on them are freefalling simply because people know they are worthless now. And I promise you, there is no counter atm. Its a really shitty part of no local because the only counter used to be local, you pulled them in as soon as a neut entered system. And Im not even mentioning moonmining, thats even worse since the rocks move and can be really far off plus sometimes multiple rorqs mine the same rocks so you can wipe out an entire grid of excavs with a couple of bombs. No risk just reward.
---
Under an umbrella, unless you bring a big crew, no.
---
Outside of an umbrella, maybe 30-50. Inside of one closer to a full fleet. (thinking bombers).
---
Atleast 30-50% of what youre killing.
---
And yes I know, I get your point. Im not being objective here, Im trying but Im tainted by what Ive seen. The numbers are too high I get it. But imo, big things should rarely die under an umbrella. And I guess this is where we disagree.
---
I get it, its not fair. Its just that any change towards the smaller group would be abused by bigger groups. Which leaves us in this rot because it makes it impossible for a smaller group to do anything.
---
I get your point and will admit that I havent really seen it from that perspective. Im always thinking in terms of what Ive seen which leans towards bigger fleets rather than smaller groups. I honestly dont know how to fix that. All I can say is if you make certain things more potent then it will be abused in a scary way by bigger groups. Like pure bloc level warfare would go into overdrive. Not necessarily a bad thing but if small groups can use the advantage to kill big things then imagine what a big group could do with it. 
---
What would you suggest? Cause the things you present are good ideas but they can all be abused. What cant be abused from N+1? I really have no clue.
---
Plenty of people who run abyss PvP in the abyss too?
---
I've seen Orthrus fits built purposely to get through T3 and enter the PvP room, and also Gila's that have killed Iki's coming from a T5
---
Additionally the narrative that people "ran away" from null to high makes no sense, is this not a game where most players have more than one character? Finally if I enjoy PvE/ need to make isk for a sub, shy would I undock and rat in anything less than a supercap when I have to spam D-scan till I get RSI and still may be caught by a ship that doesn't show up?
---
T4 And T5 abyss sites that offer the best rewards are extremely dangerous, good players routinely lose ships in them due to the unpredictable spawns. Hurr durr risk averse - if you were risk averse you wouldn't be running T5 abyss. That requires a high grade pod and blinged ship. T4 is doable without, but not easy. T3 is probably slightly more Idk/hour than L4's, but still can't be AFK'd.
---
Not saying its a good method. But it is relevant to point out that both sides need to adapt. Just changing things onesided doesnt lead to good results. It just leaves one side feeling fked.
---
Perfect is exaggerated.
---
Imo its the fact that the risk outweighs the reward. There's no balance. Why would I risk my ~ 2 bil carrier that won't be able to defend itself for long without backup, when I can instead risk a 2bil Eagle/Gila in a fight I don't need a fleet to win?
---
&gt;they've just journeyed back to the safest area to make money in the game
---
Run some T5 abyss sites and tell me it's safe.
---
Cruisers can always warp off. Nothing stops them from doing that. But if you stay on grid thinking you are gonna grind down that carrier with just a few ships then you will die. Which is the way it should be. And you can always defang, in fact thats always what you should be doing. Fighters arent all that hard to kill honestly.
---
One Thing is the main gain, the other a side project we collaborate on. Also I'm not here to deny we are de facto blue to goons, I was talking about Horde. Other than TTT our relationship is not a de facto blue one.
---
It never was. 
---
Acting as if nobody was ever killed in Goon/Test space is stupid.
---
I would like either more agility or some Venture-style warp core stability.
---
The Leviathan is gone :) look up "The Battle of Caldari Prime".
---
Only one ... but I'm poor.
---
 **Force Projection**  \- dropping caps in your own backyard is not really force projection. Also what you propose means I cannot drop caps to fight your 50 dudes so you come and fight when it is convenient for you, but I can't compensate for the time (tz, ops, etc) not being convenient for me by escalating. To me it sounds like the attacker holds all the cards and the result will be that if you are outside your alliance main tz you can't do shit. If your alliance is small and can't fight 50 dudes on a whim you can't do shit. So only goons and test will use big toys and even them will lose more than they will win, rest will stick to barges and vnis (sorry I meant myrms)...
---
 **Remove Damage Limitations** \- not only the the rorq was nerfed considerably, now you want it to just die to anything with a little of dps and 2 logis... It is fine for them to risk 3b+ of assets (which usually turns into 10) staying with their pants down for 5minutes, but it is not fine for you to wait 5 minutes for his friends to react... As long as the ship is pinned when mining, I think PANIC is a faire defense. And you want it to stay pinned cause it is currently one of the biggest generator of fights in the game.
---
 **Straight Nerfs** \- ok, lol. 2b+ ships should not be able to do anything to my gang so I can roam at leisure and the only defense will be similar sized gangs which most of the time I will choose to kite if things go tough... And again coming back to the same idea as in "Force Projection"...
---
How about let me bring supers in the whs? I think it will be quite the content generator. No? Then maybe you let nullsec support its current different game play where people can compensate for numbers with size and you worry about your env game play.
---
NOT wormholer btw
---
Ohh i like the warp code stability part , not sure about agility
---
Could you stop posting also?

Paging CODE. This is what bottom feeders exist in the ecosystem for. Get after it dudes.
---
You could almost definitely not that in low skill alphas, with plenty of time to skill up your replacements between ban waves.
---
You could almost definitely bot that in low skill alphas, with plenty of time to skill up your replacements between ban waves.
---
Lorewise that class already exists, and it appeared in game a long time ago in an event.
---
What's likelihood of bots moving to high and running anoms there? I know there isn't as many anoms and reward is less though
---
Unfortunately bumping is an extremely useful mechanic in many ways. It can be used to grief, that sucks, op is dealing with a specific case where I agree with him 100% that's garbage and shouldn't happen, sorry if it does.
---
That said, removing bumping would damn near end highsec ganking, would allow way more players to escape by crashing gates or docking in citadels when otherwise a fight would happen, would be a MASSIVE buff to supercap move ops.
---
This is actually one of the rarer uses of an already niche mechanic. Removing the mechanic altogether would be severely harmful to many other aspects of the game. A suspect flag after n bumps in y time period might be doable?
---
Hmm, highsec carebears seems too long. Nullbears. Hmm... Highcares? Highbears?
---
There's a joke in here somewhere...
---
are there any new information?
---
If you know how to fly ecm ships you shouldn’t be getting tackled. A built in warp core wouldn’t have a huge impact on how that ship is used in combat. 
---
It would also be ideal for fw bots too if they remove mining ships from plexes...
---
They got real high on volcano gas or whatever people in Iceland do to get high, watched an episode of Star Trek, saw The Borg and said "Duuuude we should totally have ice cold killer cyborg enemies too!"

saw CODE come to an ice belt and cry how its just 20 orcas and 10 skiff ...
---
You have to buy the MTC on the market. CCP will refund you the ISK. Trust me
---
I agree but that only matters in home defence fleets , On roaming fleet the warp is generally group warp and hence you mostly go at the same distance with the whole team. I know u can cancel the warp but its not always as easy to use ecm ships in roaming fleet. them being a taunt make then to be used as a sniper which is not helpful , as sniping +taunt is not always possible. I would say its too much restricting
---
cloaky proteus used to be the crazy too stronk bricktank cynomachine that was the start of every ubergank. Now it must go to timeout to pay for its sins. Sorry senpai.
---
??? The design is the only part that actually everyone agrees on that it is awesome. EVE is truly a beautiful game. Saying there is no difference between potato and high graphics makes you sound really ignorant. Maybe you stop investing in latest high end intel cpus and buy a graphics card?
---
want me to list more?
---
How much do you take for a Pixelartwork? I'd love to have a spooled up Iki.
---
Then surely he'd be more aware than most, that few go to abyss sites (especially the PvP rooms with chances of hundreds of millions in loot if you win) if they're looking for safety. 
---
My point is that if you PvE make ISK, the risk and reward is more balanced for abyss sites than they are for nullsec ratting, unless you're in a super. 
---
It isn't about safety imo, it's about not making stupid decisions.
---
I like the ticker.
---
Don’t think you’re the patron saint of New Eden. You don’t know what other people like.
---
You have to buy mining permit by order of James 315. Praise James 315 and New Order of Hisec!
---
I’ve seen plenty of them, never wanted to fly one.
---
Luminaire is Gallented space. Go be a nuisance somewhere else. Go to Uedama for all I care.
---
I bought it. You dont get the actual MPTC items. Just log in click on the alt you want to train, go to skill queue and just add skills and start training. It will automatically work 
---
So for the 3 months you can train any other char slot on that account, not just a specific one.
---
Black Ops should be dscan immune, like combat recons.
---
&gt; Under an umbrella, unless you bring a big crew, no.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Outside of an umbrella, maybe 30-50. Inside of one closer to a full fleet. (thinking bombers).
---
&gt; Atleast 30-50% of what youre killing.
---
Yeah this is where we disagree. To give perspective often we try and bridge in T3C's, each average around 800m. Usually we can get together about 10 people, so through double, triple, or quad boxing we get around 20-30 ships on grid. That's between 16b - 24b worth of assets in an attempt to kill a rorq which after the excav save into wetu's that will be worth what - 3-4b?
---
But the issue with the scenario I put was that even if we brought 100 T3C's it wouldn't matter, in the current environment we still couldn't kill that rorq. It would simply light a cyno, wait until it's in hull, then panic. Goons would have 6-7 minutes to get together whatever range of titan's felt like bosoning a fleet today and drop them. We would then be faced with trying to dodge boson's and risking a fleet worth 4 - 6 times the target or just getting out. 
---
With panic, the same math applies if it's 50 dreads. It gives the attackers no advantage to bring more, you cannot beat the cyno or PANIC module, you can't still DPS through it, there is no counter play involved. 
---
In regards to abuse, I'm not sure I agree with your premise. You state they can be abused, but don't state how. Absolutely bigger groups will be able to use the tactics against minor entities, but here's the rub - if they want to, they can already completely shaft those minor entities anyway. 
---
Giving the little guy / small gang / group of players a chance to win against a big entity doesn't change the fact that the big entity *always* does and still does have the ability to win as well.
---
Well there's the next best thing, which is the World Ark Xordazh.
---
why do people think instancing and sandbox are mutually exclusive.
---
Preety dam sure a venture can just need cyno 5 and lowslot. Might need the rigs to.
---
Source: wh's dropped on a caretaker mining fleet, a natural venture mining with us was funny for a whole 10 seconds.
---
Eww fitting your widow with ecm 🤢🤮
---
&gt; battleships and barges can fit to negate bumping completely and easily
---
Matters not at all when you're already being bumped genius.
---
I'll give an example: we've had cloakys in every system for 10 jumps or so out. Do we not play, or do we carry on with life? If a rorq is active, it can be caught. There isn't always time/numbers to get a cap fleet to save it timezones etc. And let's face it, you need a cap fleet to fight something like a 50 Kiki squad or T3C's because subcaps struggle not to get alpha'd off field.
---
Wormhole groups tend to be pretty good at hit and runs too. 
---
Obviously idiots and afk people are easiest to catch, but that's not always the case. People running abyss sites in null can also be caught fairly easily, unless they have a fleet to camp their Sig, that is n+1 any enemy fleet.
---
That Leviathan, called the CN Shiigeru, has long been destroyed in the Battle of Caldari Prime, and its wreck crashed into the Kaalakiota mountain range, causing widespread devastation in the Caldari continent of Tikiona.
---
Read the article before reading the comments expecting to agree with you but still call you out for horribly misunderstanding the expression you misused to take a shot at goons.
---
Nope, solid article, bunch of valid points. Doesnt say the blackout is bad, just that it isn't a panacea, and hey if it ends up not being great let's just not lose our cool like /r/eve always does. Looks like devs are trying, let's let them do that please.
---
Read comments. They basically all say what I just said but they did it before me. Good job /r/eve.
---
Proteus is not bad, it is different now.
---
"blob warfare is so good for the game! 4% new player retention" in response to him saying dropping on rorquals without a supercap response is fun. anyway time to mute you i realised you are either a troll or incredibly dumb now
---
No no, mean abuse like it will be much easier for them to do to eachother. Like bigger groups might do to a somewhat smaller group I mean. But still big. It will still force a new race to kill strategic things all over. But I mean, if it would help the smaller groups then why not. I dont mind paying a price to live in NS.
---
In delve, ye I get you. Thats hard. But like 20-30 T3C will kill rorqs in most other places. But ye I get it. 
---
I mean personally, I dont like the Rorq. Imo, it should only be a booster. No excavs, pump up the numbers a bit so they can mine perhaps 30m with t2s but it should remain somewhat the same otherwise. And remove both the panic but also the siege. That way its mobile, harder to catch, yet its useless in comparison to the fleet it covers. The Rorq is OP, its always been the most OP ship since they revamped it. Its hilarious what it can do honestly.
---
Check your audio, many streams are either too loud or too quiet.
---
Isn't that filthy frank?
---
Intels brand loyalty is mostly due to them consistently offering the best product (with the moderate price premium that enables them to charge). Intel wont die, not even close. If their market share where to magically fall significantly they would just lower prices and still make a healthy profit.
---
All that said, most people are probably going to buy amd for any new builds until intel releases something new or drops prices. Possibly the bigger deal is enterprise grade stuff though. AMD may have actually put themselves in a position to take some of that market share, that could be a huge deal for Intel and AMD.
---
tell em about PI and what hell it is to make nanite paste in one system on 5 planets
---
Man, you seem to be taking lighthearted banter way too seriously.
---
well it kinda makes sense, you have 4 barrels instead of 2 so you need more "surface area" from your crystal
---
&gt;Caldari continent of Tikiona
---
Damn right! :D
---
Fly with blocs, it's a pretty common meme. Eve has sound? Is also something you will hear a lot.
---
Yeah eve is pretty, but a LOT of bittervets play perma zoomed out never looking at anything up close anyway, and needing to switch to potato during a big brawl is an extra few seconds that make some people say eh, plays the same, fuck it.
---
Unless you get instablapped by 2 tornados. Or explode due to bad spawns and time is over. Personally i lost more isk running abyss in hisec (like 5b) than i did carrier/super ratting or rorq mining in null (2b in excavators).
---
Yes it is, rebranded as Joni
---
Thanks for the correction!
---
Nullboars never really were anything but highsec carebears in disguise
---
its not, omega is 500, MCT is 450 plex (475 maybe?)
---
People defend rating mining all the time, but they also attack whining pretty hard. Also as a general rule this sub thinks pve is less important to the game than pvp. Considering the game has survived this long with relatively terrible pve and pvp everywhere mechanics they're probably not wrong. When a feature makes pvp worse for the benefit of pve the sub will probably complain. Pve worse but pvp better, probably cheer.
---
Pve worse with no effect on pvp. Probably complain. Exceptions are needed nerfs, like the vni, and possibly the rorq, been gone a while dunno if it's still broken af.
---
So is eve dead now or what? Mining values have been low yet the volume of ore traded in Jita is at about 40% or less of just 2 months ago...
---
But there should be a special anti-cap module so that my five man nano gang can go head to head against a titan!
---
I bought it and it was immediately applied to my account. I was able to log in an alt and start a second skillqueue without a problem
---
It's shit nigga.
---
and looking...and looking...and looking...and looking...and looking...and looking...and looking...and looking...and looking...and looking...and looking...and looking...and looking...and looking...and looking...then either getting killed on gate by a gank of an instalocker plus 20 something ships with logi support or just a bunch of titans/supers...GG...get back to step 1
---
Yeah, but nobody here is bitching about boob proliferation and getting blobbed by large numbers of boobs every time they go outside.
---
Nerf cap production not how good they are.
---
Nice try with that BR
---
\&gt;  **Force Projection**  \- dropping caps in your own backyard is not really force projection. 
---
We can quibble over semantics but it's pretty clear at least in the context of this conversation we're using the term force projection to mean getting your force (i.e. Supers / Titans / Dreads / Faxes) into a position that's needed rapidly. 
---
\&gt;  Also what you propose means I cannot drop caps to fight your 50 dudes so  you come and fight when it is convenient for you, but I can't  compensate for the time (tz, ops, etc) not being convenient for me by  escalating. 
---
Sure you can escalate, it would just be slower then an instant cyno -&gt; jump response. For example if you have supers / titans in system you can still warp there, or if you have sub caps you can quickly contest the jammer and jump to the rorq. You can also avoid putting assets on the field you feel like you can't protect until it's in a TZ that suits you. Being close to your home with all the available resources to you, I think it's a bit rich to characterize this as the attacker holding all the cards. 
---
\&gt;  If your alliance is small and can't fight 50 dudes on a whim you can't  do shit. So only goons and test will use big toys and even them will  lose more than they will win, rest will stick to barges and vnis (sorry I  meant myrms)... 
---
What exactly do you think the state of the game is now? Hate to tell you, but if you're dropped by goons or test you really can't do shit now anyway. That's why everyone is blue with each other. Can you tell me of these mythical small alliances that are sitting on rorq clouds without super capital support at the moment that we'd be damaging with these changes? 
---
\&gt;  not only that the rorq was nerfed considerably, now you want it to just  die to anything with some dps and 2 logis...
---
Certainly not. I'd actually like it if their protection was on field with them so people could chose to engage what they see, not what they know can instantly jump in. As I was saying before, this also has the effect of spreading out capital support into bite sized chunks that people could conceivably contest. 
---
\&gt;  It is fine for them to risk 3b+ of assets (which usually turns into 10)  staying with their pants down for 5minutes, but it is not fine for you  to wait 5 minutes for his friends to react... 
---
Basically, yes. First, typically the attackers are risking a much bigger amount of isk to attack in the first place, if their fleet gets destroyed it will be in the 10's of billions of isk. Second, the home advantage means that waiting 5 minutes leads to an escalation that is impossible to fight. With the delays to projecting force it can lead to situations tilted a bit more in the attackers favor such as being able to pick off 1-2 ships before being forced to leave. 
---
\&gt;   ok, lol. 2b+ ships should not be able to do anything to my gang so I  can roam at leisure and the only defense will be similar sized gangs  which most of the time I will choose to kite if things go tough... And  again coming back to the same idea as in "Force Projection"...
---
Characterizing what I said as suggesting capitals can do nothing to subcaps is straw manning the argument. 
---
\&gt;  How about let me bring supers in the  whs? I think it will be quite the content generator. No? Then maybe you  let nullsec support its current different game play where people can  compensate for numbers with size and you worry about your env game play.
---
You seem to suggest that wormholers or these smaller groups are somehow bringing astonishing numbers of ships and you're only hope is batting them back with superior doctrines. The idea is laughable, even during "off" timezones any major nullsec block will out number a small group by a factor of 4-5 to 1. In fact, the entire problem stems from the fact that small groups *cannot* compensate for numbers with size. You can't out escalate the biggest ships in the game, so it comes down to who has more of them. In the pure numbers game, the large blocs always win.
---
Aren't you confusing 2 different senses? or is that some form of synesthesia?
---
ok.... I can get an archon into warp a full 2 seconds faster than a plated nully proteus.... This makes sense and is well balanced.
---
At least you are telling the fight properly not like they vid does. Where it tries to pretend it was a fight like really outnumbered. :)
---
While your AAR actually tells people that BBC/AVDOT where actually fighting outnumbered at the beginning. Additionally to being under fire from a Tatara.
---
Still the Zkill BR is bad as always :) butting like 60 ships on BBC/AVDOT side that are just 3rd party and never where in the fight shown in the vid at all.
---
Also what is up with nearly only AVDOT machs dieing, you guys got some hate boner against them or are they just too bad?
---
You should be exempted from fleet warp and you should be pinging on and off grid from different safes or warpables if you land at 0 with a gang/fleet your doing it wrong
---
join pro synergy. they also do this.
---
&gt; No no, mean abuse like it will be much easier for them to do to eachother.
---
**Mission Accomplished**. This is EVE, *let people kill each other*. Imagine null sec entities actually battling to inflict damage on each other that doesn't involve a month long super capital deployment across the map while the target hides. 
---
&gt; But like 20-30 T3C will kill rorqs in most other places.
---
Honestly, these days, not really. I mean like I said you have to look at the state that we're at; who's region are you going to be able to kill a rorq with that fleet?
---
Goons - As discussed, no. 
---
Test - Nope, still get super escalated on.
---
Panfam - Nope, Delve 2.0 is being sorted out now.
---
How about smaller "independant" entities? 
---
Fraternity - Nope, still dropping titans.
---
Ranger Regiment? Darkness? Who *doesn't* have the ability to do significant cap escalates in their home space these days. 
---
Anyway, I think we both largely agree, even if we have a few different viewpoints about what should / shouldn't be possible. Thanks for the reasonable discussion :)
---
Eagle? What kind of fits are people using?
---
Works against Siege Torps iirc...
---
After being destroyed by a franchise i loved very much, I really wanted to not be excited for 2077 but it's really hard.
---
Wait until your in the receiving end of your first boson 😂 still remember mine
---
I've been playing since 2005. I've never once ran any botting program. According to the community and the forums I"m getting what I deserve.
---
wow, the thought of having to fit your ship properly initially doesn't count?
---
jeez
---
I mean ye, I dunno how it will play out but its worth a try no doubt. Its fking stale atm and progress is so slow. They really need to fix that part aswell.
---
Hey honestly you would know better. If I go to kill rorqs its in big fleets so responses will differ. 
---
My pleasure, its nice to be able to actually talk to people here without everyone going emo.
---
&gt;Do we not play, or do we carry on with life? If a rorq is active, it can be caught. There isn't always time/numbers to get a cap fleet to save it timezones etc. And let's face it, you need a cap fleet to fight something like a 50 Kiki squad or T3C's because subcaps struggle not to get alpha'd off field.
---
bring your own 50 kiki's? all it looks like is a superior force winning, as it should be.
---
Imagine how awesome a new server would be...
---
For T3s probably just your standard pvp fit. It’s not very challenging there
---
Would make sense if all factions lp shops had actual equally good shops...
---
Be gone Satan
---
Are you sure those arent bots? Cause Im fairly certain those are bots. Atleast now we know where all those non-existent bots no local handled went. 
---
I just wish we would have been told that no local wont fix the bot issue. Maybe we wouldnt look stupid since we vehemently argued that the bot plague is over.
---
Upgrade your clones!
---
Ye its not bots at all. Cause botting ended with no local right?
---
hi enjoy!
---
You’re either constantly cancelling your warp when you get bumped or you’re lying. No matter what your direction or velocity, after 3 minutes of letting a warp attempt play out, your ship will warp. This is precisely designed to prevent infinite bumping without pointing. Everyone who is NOT mentioning this useful fact is a moron. This is the solution to your problem.
---
Dude, dont argue with this guy. He doesnt understand words. Perfect intel as in we know shiptype, history, the fit, his shoesize, what he had for breakfast and so on.
---
If the bots have all gone to highsec then (i) that proves that no local *is* good for the botting problem, and (ii) it will be a huge improvement to the game because the amount of ISK fountained out of high sec is so much lower than null.
---
Except those who actively PVE — the bulk of Eve’s population — also pay for the servers. Your perspective here is extremely naive.
---
From what I hear HS has the highest concentration of bots. They run combat and hauling missions. There was a spike in new players last week and Im fairly certain bot runners just moved their shit to HS. Thats what I would do.
---
In short no not really. You need something around the same size as the bumper with an mwd. Usually they use mach's or orca's
---
Heck, my main doesn't have Cyno V, let alone all the random cyno alts :p
---
Why should I bring my own 50 kiki's? This is my space. I rule here. I live here. I thrive here. I will bring bosons until you leave my space to bother someone else.
---
No it doesnt. It only means that bots move. Literally says nothing more than that.  But do you know what it does say? That the login drop most likely wasnt bots.
---
And you are quite naive if you think they just wont make even more bots to offset the isk deficit.
---
Who was 3rd party you think? there are no 3rd party. they called AOM muninn fleet and Hardknocks bhaalgorn fleet. oh ye, 7 Magus seems like 3rd party. Math is not hard dude  
---
Except 25 dreads and titans. Still outnumbered. xD
---
Calm down, satan. I need my subsystem skills to 5 when i lose my t3c.
---
 
---
Totally aggree with subcap skills only though.
---
The Proteus used to be my default fleet ship when I was a line member. I miss flying it and not being dumb for doing so.
---
Lol, man with the amount of tears we are seeing I wouldnt be suprised if that came out.
---
As long as it's an XL Torp Phoenix you should be good!
---
Can we please turn off the isk faucet that is L4's?, i mean they have no risk in highsec and gain lp into the bargin, nullsec has high risk and cant simply churn out missions like highsec krab mission runners can.
---
hi i did not
---
also, whats the reason you have your character sheet open in the lower left corner, with portrait, no less? is this to show your handsome virtual face to the stream, like those other weirdo streamers do with the actual faces?
---
i dont get this culture
---
Wish I could downvote twice.
---
can you adapt pls
---
stop defending bots
---
There's no time for lubrication!
---
Hi! 
---
I used to run out of boosters(quafe&amp;overclocker) in mid-battle and it's easy to see when your booster runs out with character Augmentation sheet open.
---
Because sand castles shouldn't be unassailable?
---
Forcing new players to get neutral haulers is a sure way to make them quit
---
Be in horde, no auth
---
Delete ECM it's shit
---
Also warp core stabilizers
---
&gt;I dont have end intel cpus  and my Zotac RTX2080TI for playing eve online :) , i just play because this game its very complex and complete and that for more than ten years already , and yes there are players who do not play necessarily for the graphics of the game.
---
It should have a police skin
---
*smell
---
The ships were vulnerable you were watching them but just didn't have friends to help you kill them
---
Shut up retard
---
better become a f1 money if u think other modes of fitting shud not be allowed , game does not need to be monotnous , if there are ways of killing there shud be ways of protecting else its just a normal shooter game
---
Can you use google translate?
---
ECM is shit
---
It's still going in the pay2play cash grab direction with making isk on your own to fund your pvp with even just t1 ships with t2 fits being increasingly harder.
---
That's why there are so many bots, the players do not accept the horrendous waste their time farming is in this game.
---
its shit till ccp fixes it
---
Eve es basura racista.
---
Deseo con todas mis fuerzas que quiebren y se vallan todos debajo de un puente.
---
Dios deseo que se unda Eve.
---
Todo por ser un juego que se olvidó de la comunidad española.
---
SI DIOS EXISTE QUE EVE QUIEBRE DE UNA VEZ.
---
Freighters have no guns or tank. Why you didn't kill them?       
---
You can bubble them point them and they die preeeeeeety fast.
---
No fixing allowed. Only removing. Mechanic was shit in the first place they improved it but its still shit. Best fix is delete ECM. Be a real man and use real EWAR
---
You're describing a situation like it was back in 2006-2008 (Cant recall when JF were introduced). Regular freighters would need an escort fleet from empire to their destination in null. It took effort and was a group activity.
---
Yes, it wasn't exciting, but, goshdarnit, it *mattered*. We had stuff to move, supplies to deliver, gatecamps to disperse. IN THE SNOW, UPHILL BOTH WAYS.
---
Keep talking out of your ass no one listens
---
The range of ecm ships is very good, if properly supported, e.g. protected against fast tackle by something like a jackdaw they can be very effective. However the speed of ecm ships is very poor, I think they could use a bit of a buff here.
---
Do it yourself you lazy cunt.
---
Seems to be your approach. 
---
You can't post any evidence of what you claim, because you are making it up.
---
Instead of buffing stats until it becomes good by virtue of numbers, I think the best way to do it would be to give ECM a useful role. Right now it has a role (counter to logi) which overlaps significantly with damps, but damps are much more flexible and arguably more effective.
---
For instance, maybe ECM can be redesigned as a more direct counter to fleet support ships including logi. A beginning of an idea I had is that ECM could reduce the effectiveness of remote assistance modules like remote reps or sensor boosters. This still leaves ECM with a significant role overlap with damps in terms of countering logi, but it would still almost never be bad to have some ECM against most proper fleets and could be used to break open logi n+1 syndrome.
---
The only other role of ECM I know of is a (not particularly effective) counter to drones and fighters, and as far as I know it's almost unique in this niche (I guess smartbombs still exist technically). That being said, jamming individual drones is a pain and not really viable in most fights. Maybe another direction for rework would be as a dedicated drone boat counter, which I think would bring drones more in line with other weapon systems which have disruption modules to counter them. Something like ECM modules activations on a ship reducing its drone control range, or other drone related stats, might be an interesting starting point.
---
None of these really fix the Griffin Navy though. That boat needs to be rebuilt from the ground up.
---
He is saying (at my best guess from limited Spanish) that we don’t accept the Spanish community enough
---
Go to amarr there's some always there.
---
if the community wants ecm removed , i dont mind but i think its also a very different mechanism . it just became op . i just want few waste ships to be revived, if they dont like ecm ships maybe make a new module to replace it. but i liked ecm. Even a 1 day newbie player could contribute a lot with a small griffin in a fite with ecm .
---
Protect carriers , fites, save someone , etc etc. I think the modules's idea was good just implements badly
---
Buffer gilas are ungankable mate. You’d need 8 tornados in highsec to kill a regular buffer gila that heats its hardeners when it sees nados on the filament... 8 nados is like 600m, you will legit never even break even dropwise, even if they all use a c-type invuln (which they don’t have to).
---
Nerf buffer regen gilas CCPls.
---
It's your job to make it dangerous, if you prefer watch instead of killing it, don't come here for cry about it.
---
ECM was shit. It was something you couldnt mitigate. There was no skill at all. Now its kind of still the same but you can at least remove the guy jamming you which is good. EC 300s are still broken as shit.
---
&gt; you are quite naive if you think they just wont make even more bots to offset the isk deficit
---
Why wouldn't they already be running as many bots as they could?
---
&gt; But do you know what it does say? That the login drop most likely wasnt bots.
---
Only if you think that 100% of the botters in nullsec picked up a L4 mission bot. We should be able to see in July's MER if that's the case.
---
Sorry that you feel we exclude the Spanish community. Honestly, we want everyone to play the game so we can have fun and have big wars.
---
&gt; On roaming fleet the warp is generally group warp and hence you mostly go at the same distance with the whole team
---
Anything other than mainline DPS should be fleet warp exempt, that's a learn-to-play issue. If you drop your logi at 0 and it gets brawled off the field, that doesn't mean logi needs buffing, it means you need to learn not to warp at 0.
---
ECM is still very viable in a small gang scenario where you can kite the fight.
---
ec 300 have like a very minor chance of getting u jammed , eg frig vs a frig u would not be able to maybe survive like 50% times , however for big ships ecm drones are not even worth using
---
Eve es un juego de mierda. Ojalá quiebre próximamente. Se lo tienen merecido por dejar a la comunidad española de lado.               
---
&gt;Eve is a fucking game. I hope it breaks soon. They deserve it for leaving the Spanish community aside.          
---
I did, got something like this but i assumed that google translator was simply bad.      
---
If he wrote it even with limited en-GB knowledge he could see if this is what he wanted to say.             
---
Because tbh i have no idea what he is talking about atm.
---
We don't care where u are from, what language you are speaking or what gender you are... Why should we? In the end we will blow you up anyways, capsuleer! 😉
---
Que te den!
---
Wow dude please pass my "thank you" to your girlfriend. Also thank you for posting. I stole your wallpaper.
---
Have you fought in keepstar range before?
---
I understand this.
---
So far, I've mostly played alone due to a lack friends I could ask to play.
---
This brought me to mainly play singleplayer games, story based singleplayer games for that matter. I am not that deep into more community based, 'social' games as I only started playing some of those not too long ago.
---
I know that EVE would be a very big departure from what I've been used to.
---
On another note, the game itself doesn't seem to give me much incentive to get bigger stuff if the cheaper one is sufficient to get by in the game (and I heard it's safer in terms of drawing attention from PK-ers).
---
Keepstars were manned

This man gets it
---
You're pretty loud on the topic of ECM for someone who clearly has no experience giving or recieving ECM. You can swarm carriers with ec 300s and they become useless mate. And it takes so long to target them back you'll get jammed in that time.
---
Yes issue is people now a days dont even want an ecm change at all , they are afraid . i never said revert ecm i said fix ships and the module so it can be of help in a useful manner and not always die first
---
&gt;bring your own 50 kiki's? all it looks like is a superior force winning, as it should be.
---
Nah we drop caps, and they make salty rage filled posts about caps needing a nerf. But my point was if I'm a corp member with limited time, my options are also limited. I can chose high risk low reward, or do something else.
---
Hey man renters fly weird shit sometimes.
---
That could still shit out a ton of dps
---
agree  at the time of ecm nerf some hints of tank or agility was suppose to be added to counter the ecm fix but that was never enough
---
D:
---
COSMOS is a fucking relic and needs to be removed.
---
So?      
---
Loosing like 1-2 bombers for a freighter kill ...      
---
Whats the problem.
---
kite on ecm ship being the slow ship they are and the bad align time , i seriously feel sad for the ship
---
It's not dumb. I considered contacting him but didn't know if that's the right thing to do. Then to my surprise he opens a chat invitation to me, which I gladly accepted. But by the time I accepted there was nobody in chat. I opened an invite to him but he didn't respond so I suppose he made a mistake and wanted to contact someone else.
---
It's not dumb, there's nothing to lose.
---
You are a valuable member of our eve community keep it up
---
then why complain moron
---
Hey unos cuantos consejos de parte de otro español:  
---
\- Unete a una corp hispana, hay muchas desde corps pequeñas hasta corps de cientos de jugadores hispanos en las grandes alianzas.  
---
\- Métete al canal Español del juego, se llama "Español" para preguntar dudas y hablar con gente.
---
\- Vete pensando en prender ingles si el problema es el idioma, que es 2019.
---
\- Deja de llorar, si no te gusta el juego lárgate pero puedo confirmarte que no es culpa de CCP ni de EvE si te sientes excluido/agredido por ser hispano, es culpa tuya por juntarte con quien no debes  
---
\- Deja de avergonzar a la comunidad Hispana poniendo estas cosas en Reddit que lo único que provocas es darnos mala imagen.
---
It’s the Reddit way: go over the top with lighthearted banter, make a mockery of the most painful tragedy.
---
Come live with us, you’ll question the choices you made in your life.
---
do whatever you want, but you gotta pick a narrative:
---
either it's impossible to live in null, or it's easy to kill shit with massed caps.
---
“Jump jump hold cloak!”
---
“D-scan clear.” 
---
“Fleet, starburst spread out to all anomalies further out than 14.3 AU. Report any hostile ships and bubbles on grid or on d-scan. Burn in to tackle and call out warp-in as fast as possible.”
---
“Warp drive active,” verbalises in disinterested voice my ship computer as I lock onto a combat anomaly far out of long scan range. In preparation, I send commands to pre overheat propulsion and tackle mods along with adrenaline glands stimulators. Warp bubble collapses as I land on grid with a handful of my fleet members and a small group of Sansha pirates.
---
“Damn...,” I sigh in my pod as I hastily align my ship out and initiate warp to escape the pirates’ response and relocate for a different lookout point. “We didn’t come to fight you today...”
---
“System clear. Move on to next gate towards destination.”
---
“Jump in and hold cloak.” 
---
As this little routine repeats a couple of more times as we delve deeper into enemy territory, I begin to realise the beauty of it. Our fleet, consisting of cheap tech one frigates and a handful of support destroyers, can go out there, deep into controlled null-sec space and provoke disruption and chaos without instant perfect response fleet form-up. The FTL intel blackout allows us to execute an actual hit-and-run raid under the cloak of the night. 
---
Or do are we simply walking into a well-executed trap? Have we been spotted by a sneaky scout on our way and are we about to get dropped on by a carefully composited response fleet? 
---
On the way to our ever-changing destination, we catch a couple of stragglers on gates boosting our morale up, but letting our presence be surely known to the rest of the alliance. But we fear not and carry on with our mission.
---
Then all out of sudden, the proverbial quiet before the storm sets in, too many systems clear. Scouts reporting no signatures in 2-3 systems out. Our stride slows down to a more vigilant pace. Something is afoot. The sense of unknown and mystery I haven’t felt since I lived in wormhole space sets in. The fact, that you might just under eyes of tens or hundreds at the very moment is something that freezes the fleet chatter. We jump on more time.
---
As our warp bubble collapses one more time, we are greeted by the sight of a medium sized Jackdaw fleet. This is going to be a bloodbath.
---
I cannot wait.
---
“Primary…!”
---
All right for now I'm not going to worry too much about specific situations like dictors and bombers. I don't know what they are but it sounds too specific and I try to deal with the common scenarios first.
---
So what's best then when someone enters your space while doing sites. Instantly cloak or instantly warp away?
---
All I can say is, if you meet a woman who says, "Let's go be pirates!" you have to marry her. That's space law.
---
&gt;Ah yes, because people should always be fit for pvp / instant warping, especially in highsec where most of the retarded bumping stupidity can occur without any ability to aggress.
---
usually the defense is a single module, don't pretend like that's that much of a drawback
---
likewise, bumping is hardly ever an issue for 99% of highsec players
---
&gt;"THE ANSWER SHOULD ALWAYS BE N+1" I can see why you'd want to defend that when you feel you should have forever to rally up a team of retards to finally "pvp" someone but only after ensuring you can win.
---
it's not about n+1, if i have 50 bumpers a webber will counter all of them.
---
likewise, there is no reason you should expect to be able to beat 50 players all ready and waiting for you with one character
---
you need to sit down and think about your arguments before you spout nonsense that hurts your own point
---
AOE doomsday through cyno was yes :)
---
Yet awesome in the traditional sense
---
Google translate has brought the salt!
---
Eve is racist trash. I wish with all my strength to break and go all under a bridge. God, I want Eve to join. All for being a game that forgot the Spanish community. IF GOD EXISTS EVE BREAKING ONCE.
---
So the high level cloaks allows you to stay cloaked during warp? And they can look invisible up until the point they jump you?
---
So in general I take that if I someone shows up in my dscan in a perfect world I have about 5-6 seconds to warp away. Now I see why it's important to dscan every second.
---
So assuming there's someone at the site, generally speaking if I warp within say 50 km from the site and I don't see anyone in dscan it means they're cloaked and I still have that 5-6 second window to react. And they can't reach me cause I'm about 50km away.
---
remove jumpfreighters
---
TL;DR Translation for those interested:  
---
He says he "hopes this shitty game goes bankrupt because it's racist towards the hispanic/spanish community"  
---
TL;DR Of my answer:  
---
"Hey, A few tips from a fellow spaniard:  
---
\-Join a hispanic corp, plenty of them both small and in the big blocks  
---
\-Join the spanish ingame channel  
---
\-Learn english, it's 2019 (not that I'm an exaple... but at least I try)
---
\-Stop crying, if you don't feel comfortable because as an hispanic it's because you surrounded yourself with the wrong people.  
---
\- Don't post shit like this it's counterproductive.
---
"Eve es un juego de mierda" means "Eve is a shitty game", if this helps. OP is probably just drunk and salty because nobody understands what he is saying typing in spanish with caps on in local.
---
Most players simply don't play Eve this way but that fact seems totally lost to you.
---
Still, it's especially players like you who would benefit A LOT if Omega would unlock limitless accounts, multicharacter training and multiboxing.
---
PCCh lleva sin escuchar a la comunidad desde hace 10 años.
---
Es el momento de abandonar este juego desfasado, dejemos de dar nuestro dinero a una empresa tan negaste como es PCCh
---
You saying that AFK multiboxing 10 of them with excavators wasn't the intended use?
---
It's only isk! :)
---
Si nublando tambien
---
Si me envías tu isk, lo multiplicaré por dos
---
I noticed a lot of groups are turtling up together, they're less spread out. I would like to see a rework of anomalies to lower the spawn rate and make people spread out to krab.
---
Honestly I hate when someone makes a post and never replies to anyone.  It makes me think it was just a troll. 
---
Thank you for putting together a great reply and a translation for everyone.
---
Correct. Keep in mind that the 'high level cloaks' I mentioned (a.k.a. covert cloaks) can only be fitted to a select few ship types. Your first covert ship will almost certainly be the Astero. If you go to show info on it, and look under traits, you'll see that it explicitly mentions the ability to fit a covert cloak. 
---
&gt;So assuming there's someone at the site, generally speaking if I warp within say 50 km from the site and I don't see anyone in dscan it means they're cloaked and I still have that 5-6 second window to react. And they can't reach me cause I'm about 50km away.
---
This is correct. In such a case, best-case scenario is that they're tricked into thinking you actually warped at 0, at which point they spring their trap only to see you land 50km off. That way you know what's up and you should probably move on to a different hole. This is highly probable too - as a hunter, you generally wouldn't expect an explorer to be this clever. However, it's possible they keep a cool head and don't show themselves, at which point you don't get any information just by warping to the site at 50km.
---
And the reason you didn’t catch them and kill them was... you didn’t want to risk losing a couple of ships to kill some freighters? Who is being risk averse here?
---
Go on a goons summer deployment and you see casually 1300 of them like it's nothing
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
They all jump ...
---
Englishmen that neither using a translator have enough ci to understand something.
---
I will not say anything else. I just hope that your dear EVE breaks and they leave you with nothing.
---
no. fuck ecm, it's a terrible mechanic and it needs to die altogether. caldari need new ewar.
---
Could get over a million ehp with slaves and officer mods back in the day
---
Why is there lots of comments defending the ability to put a jumpgate on grid with a keepstar?
---
I dont know. Maybe technical aspects? Maybe they dont need more? Why should there even be an upper limit?
---
I dont know. It kinda makes sense but perhaps not because of no local but rather the VNI nerf. Gilas in HS makes more sense than Domis in NS. Very low risk and I dont think the isk differs that much. If it does they can just offset by making more. This could have been planned ever since the VNI nerf announcement. 
---
Its speculation on my part but as you say, the MER should show increase in HS. Will it be significant, dunno. If im not mistaken MER is always regional which means that spreading them out over different regions (which they prob would do anyways because of safety) could make the rise too low to be interpreted as significant, i.e., non random. One could calculate the total but even then its hard to actually say anything definitive, atleast for us.
---
Dangers only good if it happens to other people obviously
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! FUUUUUCK MEEEE.....
---
why?
---
&gt; you need to sit down and think about your arguments before you spout nonsense that hurts your own point
---
Ironic from someone defending how its completely necessary and they *must* be allowed to bump people indefinitely, possibly without ever aggressing.
---
dunno how many keepstars you've gunned before but i can promise you it cant shoot the 1000km to the nearest gate, so i fail to see the problem here bud
---
Like others have said, mine worked perfectly.
---
What does your email receipt say? Mine specifically stated that I got MCT:
---
"1 x 3 Month EVE subscription @ 28.99 GBP = 28.99 GBP  
---
1 x Multi Characters Training @ 0.00 GBP = 0.00 GBP"
---
If yours doesn't mention MCT then you must have purchased 3 months game time and not the MCT promo. If it does mention it then I guess you'll just have to wait for CCP to get back to your ticket.
---
Just an added angle. A different aspect of the game.
---
They're basically useless, except maybe as a hauler (650k ehp cold bling fit, nearly 1 million ehp hot). So if you have high/medium value- low m3 items to haul, it's probably the best choice in hisec. 
---
They were popular when hisec was more popular because of mining boosting fleets, but they're now pretty useless since mining fleets are pretty much gone from hisec. It might sometimes happen in wormholes, but mining in wormholes is not something most corps do. You can always use Rorqs in wormholes, but you're very much at the mercy of any hunters.
---
The last use of an orca is a truly AFK miner. It's not very efficient, but it takes 3 hours for the orca to fill both of its cargo bays and you're basically ungankable. Pressing 1 button for 15m-20m isk per hour is not the worst income since it's 100 risk-free. All someone could really do is to bump you out of range of the asteroids or kill your drones.
---
There are two types of eve player it would seem, the nullsec donuts attract a certain type and then everyone else!
---
So the whole server is in delayed mode now!
---
EVE has a shares system, but they have to be manually traded and there's lots of delays built into it.  
---
The problem, as always with anything to do with the EVE market, is that there's no accountability. Almost everything is done on neutral, mostly untracable, disposable accounts. 
---
Without the accountability, you can't really have a stock exchange as you've no recourse against whoever you invest with.
---
Corporate stock was never as valuable as it should’ve been imo
---
i never said that, i said it's completely fine, not that it's necessary.
---
bumping doesn't do anything to you, just walk away or don't retard fit your ship in the first place lmao
---
it's a super niche strategy that effects only the greediest and biggest ships in the game, don't be retarded
---
&gt; it's possible they keep a cool head and don't show themselves, at which point you don't get any information just by warping to the site at 50km. 
---
No but at least they're cloaked and you still have that 5-6 seconds window, assuming you spam dscan like crazy once you arrive.
---
So hunters are actually in a constant disadvantage because they have to either be uncloaked so they can instantly lock you, or they take their chances and uncloak when they want to jump you but then you have that time window which allows you to warp away or whatever.
---
If so this is great information. This helps me know exactly what windows are I should be paying attention to. So it all comes down to dscan actually. I suppose setting up a script or macro that hits the scan (through keyboard) every second is not allowed in Eve? :)
---
Wait after rereading my post I think I missed something? When they're cloaked, and I check the area first, then move in assuming they need time to uncloak which gives me time to escape. I didn't count in the time I need to warp out and warp in again. So they can use the time I warp out to uncloak and target me, which then doesn't give me time to warp back out?
---
As someone who posts incessantly on changes he would like I’m surprised you don’t see the obvious issues I’ve raised. Nullsec would be much more active with content if it wasn’t safe.  Other players to interact with in an MMO is a good thing.
---
They didn't died, because you weren't prepared to get the stuff in to kill them. Regardless of that, many of us including a good bunch of imperium members would like it if Jump Bridges and Beacons could not be anchored in range of an Upwell structure especially Keepstars but also Fortizars. Coming here and whining isn't really good style, though. It's just another dumb CCPlease post with a demand that is out there for quite some time.
---
\xF0\x9F\x98\x82
---
ITS OOOOOOOONLINE AGAIN, WHAT A TIME TO BE AALLLLLLLLLLLLIIIIIVVVVEEEEEEEEEEE
---
But what do they do in highsec with their Gilas? Run abyssal sites?
---
I'm not even joking, one of our scouts yesterday reported a Horde bean ratting in a revelation, and there was a saber warping back and forth between him and a structure. Eventually the guy figured out that the sabre was warping in to kill the frigates that the revelation couldn't track. My fucking sides man!

Amigo crees que está basura de juego, come vidas y racista merece el más mínimo esfuerzo de aprender inglés....

Ya te aseguro que nunca gastaré un solo céntimo en una basura que ni tiene en cuenta al 2 idioma más hablado del jodido mundo.

Después PCCh llora y solo gastan vuestro dinero en la creación de juegos Android y demás basura...

bruh eve is already dead
---
bruh 😝🤤🔥🔥🙌
---
i want free kills on defenseless ships uhat are worth billions of isk. damn am i gonna have to join code?
---
Sois le changement que tu veux voir
---
Lo normal en un juego pro Trump racista
---
&gt;So hunters are actually in a constant disadvantage because they have to either be uncloaked so they can instantly lock you, or they take their chances and uncloak when they want to jump you but then you have that time window which allows you to warp away or whatever.
---
Bingo
---
&gt;Wait after rereading my post I think I missed something? When they're cloaked, and I check the area first, then move in assuming they need time to uncloak which gives me time to escape. I didn't count in the time I need to warp out and warp in again. So they can use the time I warp out to uncloak and target me, which then doesn't give me time to warp back out?
---
I'm not totally sure I get what you mean by this. If they don't decloak after seeing you warp in at 50, then they can wait for you to come back at 0. If they see you warping at 0, they can decloak while you are still landing, which gives them time to recalibrate their sensors after decloaking, and by the time you land they can start locking you (worst case scenario for you). 
---
Also, a single ship type (stealth bombers) have the unique feature that their sensors don't need to recalibrate after decloaking - theyu can begin locking you up immediately. This is the slimmest possible window for you to escape, although they're not the most common ship to hunt in.
---
We need behemoths back :) One day ... maybe
---
It’s not just freighters that use jump gates. I thought it showed how broken they are when so many freighters are able to use nullsec safely, someone has commented about how it used to be doing logistics. They were interesting times and alliances had to plan runs.
---
It is so bad for the game that only 4% of new players stay. Yet, they want more of it. It is very strange.
---
You mean Griffin Navy... There is no ship in the game more nerffed that GNI... Change my mind
---
I remember how excited I was when I saw my first Titan, those were the days...
---
Maybe move l4s to lowsec
---
keep doing this mate, fuck those salty bitches
---
Corp stocks work differently than how you Imagine they do
---
Nah. Just because you have the skills doesn't mean a hull was available. B-R occurred before  skill injectors and there were a couple hundred Titans on field.   
---
Time.
---
Time was the biggest factor.
---
Well said.
---
They don’t work. They don’t really do anything. From my point of view it is a forgotten/unused system. I was just thinking it would be an interesting new venture.
---
Hi! Thank you! XD
---
So what you actually saw was a bunch of freighters too stupid to get a titan bridge from keepstar tether to the next keepstar in docking range
---
That was before jump freighters
---
si nublando tambien
---
Nah, you just need more crystals.
---
no shit.
---
Keepstars in null are fit vs capitals, a gang of stealth bombers could kill them with minimal losses
---
Well said
---
Youre pretty loud on the topic if carrierfights for someone who clearly has no experience giving or receiving carrierfights. You can smartbomb them real quick as basically every pvp carrierdoctrine  has a sb fitted.
---
PS. I am split on the topic. ECM is kinda shit, but i think some revamp of ships with ECM boni should be done.
---
watches 8 undefended freighters jump 8 gates and complains its too safe while he sits safely cloaked up watching, the problem here is people like you not the freighter pilots,
---
And that kids, is how I met your mother.
---
Its a mechanic to forcefully change ceo. Thats about the only thing its good for. Handing out shares is just a huge security risk.
---
Piggybacking off this data focused thread: any plans to add “players in space in the last 30 minutes” to the Universe scope in the ESI? ☺️
---
Dont eat on stream. reading the chat and answering is pretty good, fleets with viewers. Finally the quality of the overlay and custom images and sounds such as for the intro for subs make the stream look professional and viewers watch it even if the content is shit. Im not a fan of giveaways.
---
Ya super badass, in a modern sense.
---
It is better to throw money with investments in games that no one will play.
---
It would not be much better to translate the game into Spanish (it is the second most spoken language in the world).
---
In front of the English.
---
Why do not they do it? They are racist, they come from the hand of Trump.
---
the only intel non custom bots have (the ones you can buy) is local intel, not even reading channels, please shut up forever until you know what you are talking about
---
With shit like this, damn right
---
Again?
---
Come visit TEST in Eso.  All the boobs you can handle and more 🍻
---
Right. My thought is if folks have something to invest in. Like minerals have their own stock, corps will have actively traded stock based on either production of goods or trade or something. It would give people more ways to possibly make isk other then grinding NPC sites or mindlessly shooting rock/ice/moons.
---
You mean to say that in 8 jumps you didnt decloak bombers on them and kill them?  in 8 jumps you didnt do anything and you want CCP to kill them for you?
---
You said they went to a gate.. Imo you're making excuses the danger was there, you were just to risk averse to do anything
---
I’d suggest leaving the tags on and the item intact. If you cut it up, CCP may not take returns.
---
They took an Ansiblex gate to travel the equivalent of 8 jumps in 1 jump is what he means.
---
He’s a chode, but that doesn’t mean his arguments are wrong.
---
Let's not forget you were to risk adverse to attack a ship that can't attack back lol
---
These were normal freighters.. Gating.. Op is just risk adverse and to cowardly to fight unarmed ships
---
I’ve lost enough sub caps on keepstars to them to know that they wreck all ships
---
To a jumpgate on grid with a keepstar
---
The keepstar is not attacking you 1000km off so yes.
---
Plz make “3 whole gilas” a new meme. Kthx
---
Try and understand the broader concept of my post.
---
i never said they weren't normal freighters........
---
Ganking a freighter is doable on a keepstar grid
---
Exceptional pun, well done.
---
Flagging is better
---
I like the idea of ecm being the counter to logi maybe the other ewar weapons too it would have to be balanced though
---
I’m not ‘reeing’ on Reddit. I’m using Reddit as it was intended and having a spot of lunch reading your responses. I am surprised at how desperate you all are to keep nullsec safe. I hope CCP continues to ignore your cries
---
It is possible yes.
---
I think CCP should drop English support, and us all have to learn Icelandic!
---
Look at the player count numbers to see just how bad shitadels hit this game. Summer of Boredom was the all time low point of this game.
---
&gt;fuuuuuunnn
---
You know that bots dont have emotions right ?
---
You are ignorant of the politics at play here, CCP is in Iceland, and that last line of your post is most likely false.
---
Sorry you feel you don’t have support, but that doesn’t stop me from bumping into at least 2 primarily Spanish groups a week.
---
Have to disagree, the tank on these cancers is the range at which they can ruin your fight - soloing a small gang in a brawling BS, with only a ickle-sig Griffin 80km yonder to shoot at, is only marginally better than it was (ie. at least you have something to shoot at). Much as I dislike ecm, I see why its in the game - buffing it or the angular little ships it infests should be at the bottom of the to do list though. 
---
Just bounce off grid if you take damage - the tackle/dps/logi are doing the real work anyways.
---
Plenty of people on this board warned you guys that this wouldn't affect botters.
---
ah right on I meant solo/small fleet combat sabre instead of fleet sabre
---
Who would have thought that due to blackout players would turtle closer to ns blobs with super umbrellas? Man if only i had seen it coming...
---
So if someone waits at a site while being cloaked and he uncloaks instantly as I'm coming out of warp then I'm dead. Cause the time it takes to come out of warp and to go back in warp is enough for him to do what he needs to do. 
---
And I wouldn't see him if I just approach the site at 50km cause he's cloaked. 
---
So that's the only situation where I literally can't do anything about it. Right?
---
Cause all other scenarios I still have time to react due to uncloaking taking time, except for the uncomon like the stealth bomber you mention, I'll figure that out later.
---
In my previous response I was thinking that even in this scenario I would have the upper hand, if we want to call it that way, but actually we don't in that scenario.
---
However, if I warp in a site and I'm completely out of warp, and I'm still not being targeted then I have the upper  hand again because now he (wherever he comes from whether he was there or not) will need to uncloak and I still have time to warp away.
---
Thanks for sticking with me btw this is very helpful information. It's important to know your vulnerabilities. In fact, this helps me in 2 ways. Playing defensively as an explorer and who knows when I want to get in pvp this helps me as the aggressor as well.
---
In a vacuum, I'd take on a BS in a frig. Even using a bs with close-range high tracking guns, an AB frig will simply not get hit by the BS if flown properly (always keeping high transversal). Then it really depends what kind of tank the BS has and if it has webs. If it has webs, the frig is dead, if it has a really strong active cap-stable tank, the frig might not break it. In all other cases, the frig will kill the BS. It's always been part of Eve's subcap meta that it's much harder for bigger ships to kill ships smaller than them (BS shooting frigs for example). That's why destroyers are anti-frigate ships and battlecruisers are anti-cruiser ships.
---
To properly shoot a frig, a battleship needs to be specifically fitted for it with close-range high tracking guns and multiple tracking modules, often gimping it's tank. Or something off-meta like fitting small or medium guns on a battleship. Most battleships can't easily pull it off.
---
Carriers will chew up any small gang that don't immediately leave the field, or that can't outrun their fighters. You're only recourse as a cruiser gang that gets dropped on by a carrier is to leave (except maybe for Munnin or similar gangs who can outrun the fighters and fight the cruiser at range). Depending on how fast the cruisers are going (and if they're using AB vs MWD) HAW Dreads will also obliterate cruiser gangs if they stay on field.
---
To keep with the theme of Caldari being anti-Gallente/anti-drone, ECM should generate a field that affects drones, such as temporarily disables them based on field strength (such as a stronger strength gives you a larger and longer area of effect).
---
It will be a soft nerf to drone boats (as I figure the Caldari would jave probably tried something to weaken the Gallente strength).
---
Drawback could be that it affects all drones (not just hostiles), weakens your own systems (pick a stat, speed, sog radius, etc).
---
I dunno, maybe a script to make it single target?
---
Or make the duration of the jam based on signal strength.
---
Like WTF.          
---
Those are freighters, you can kill them easily.    
---
They are bad at receiving reps, they are slow and slow align.         
---
Person did a stupid thing "jump gating" those freighters.       
---
You could use bunch of bombers to blap those freighters, a single dread with emergency damage control could probably suicide all of them.         
---
Like you are simply unwilling to take some loses as "this is unfair".              
---
Honestly i gladly trade a dread for so many freighters, especially that they probably are not empty.
---
Ice Ice baby
---
My bad if i depicted that way, First of all i am sorry . As u said i am a noob . I only have 1 year of experience on game and on pvp mostly have played with griffin, blackbird or kirin(now). I am too new to game.

I dont want to sound ignorant  and if i did i am sorry again
---
My issue with ecm is that i am a caldari person all skills in caldari , but 5-6 ships in my tree are just full on waste , Thats why i kinda cried for help . that please either do something to ships purely dependent on ECM or just change mechanics of ecm .
---
You might want to use an overlay to hide chat (or switch to a channel that you create for your viewers to join).
---
I would say no to implants being allowed. 
---
I agree with you, the mass constraint might not be the best notion. As you stated it might be better to limit number of ship types 
---
If ccp approached the idea with the concept that a variety of fleets would be allowed and viable, in a manner that limits a rock paper scissor scenario of the current abyssal trace. 
---
Yes i would like the agency to tell on the map that someone (but not who) has initiated a zone/arena and the system. But no other details. You could check zkill to see if there is a group that commonly does these shenanigans in that system. But you wouldnt know for sure. 
---
The success or failure would be (in my opinion) a changing of the constraints (whatever dictates how many or how big of ship is allowed). This would force people to have to adapt, and one main fleet wouldn't be accepted as the golden or best. 
---
As for the 'gaming' of the system. I dont have an answer. Not right now
---
if i can get more isk for less effort elsewhere, the activity isn't worth doing. therefore it is worthless.
---
Thanks for pointing that out.   We didn't notice.
---
You know, I'm very happy to see how CCP uses your money to pay for other people's games.
---
Some say that the Spanish community does not spend. But think at least 1 second.
---
Would not you like more people to play the day before?
---
It is better to continue playing the same thing forever.
---
If I played pvp, I would like to see more people in the game ... but you only know how to defend the CCP as a racist garbage company.
---
Good
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeepost?
---
If you dont want to put up with it, dont live in a wh?
---
I haven't seen anyone else crossposting it to this subreddit.
---
If you ignore it has an ecm bonus, you can get a decent fit out of it.
---
I think it's better if I don't go there. I probably would cause problems on the server.
---
Is there a decent PvP or ratter setup for it? I have it trained up but always felt that the Tengu was the better ship.
---
Its how i banged yours.
---
They're thoroughly outclassed in basically everything by other T3Cs except maybe as a FW mission runner (see Olmeca's video) or that weird fit with Large Smartbombs that deals 2000 damage instantly, without needing to lock anyone.
---
I find ECM pretty handy to bring along if I'm in a tight brawling gang, as the ECM ship can just warp in at 50 and influence the fight. You can get a lot of mileage out of it in these gangs.
---
Please excuse my ignorance; I get why botting would drop off but for just normal bears in the big alliances, why is blackout so much of an issue? Surely the super cap umbrella still works?
---
When did you do it? It was a 1 day promo from what I can tell
---
But if you ignore the ship bonus, then my point is proven...
---
Ah now I see you didn’t understand. Ansiplex jump gates were used not normal gates
---
I turned it off 5 seconds after it first appeared.

I called the other Person out for basically calling you ignorant. Not you :). Have an updoot for human decency. And actually i get your pain. Hopefully CCP will revamp some of the ships.
---
Hey CODE babies, now's your chance to prove you are the elite PVPers you claim to be!  Time to start culling all these nullbears who are running out sites and mining our tritanium rocks....
---
I agree with you as I had the same experience (Phenom II then Intel i5-4590 and I only recommended Intel since then) but my next upgrade will be a Ryzen 3xxx, as it seems that AMD hit hard and I rarely see bad appreciation about the Ryzen series. I am willing to take the risk :)
---
Still, Intel has leadership problem, seems to fail the passage to 10 nm, and AMD is rizen again. Maybe I exagerated a little bit by saying that it is dying, but they are going to lose ground for sure.
---
I think your accusations of racism are overblown, I think Spanish localization would be a good idea, but I know for a fact that there are very active groups that are primarily Spanish.
---
Honey, I'm sorry you guys just lost a big fight with us, but...c'mon.
---
Has he died forever?

You are correct, my apologies.

The text was too fast but I loved the Skyrim ending!

Its an honest mistake so dont worry about it :)

you tried not being shit, that might help?
---
I'm portuguese i didn't like how the drifter and blackout was hand out, but 1 thing i can't agree with you, ccp isn't racist, stop day dreaming it's 2019 go learn some english, saying ccp is racist coz it doesn't have a spanish version it's same thing saying all the game campanys are racist coz they don't always have spanish version get your head out of your arse .... ffs

well they can prevent this &gt; LP cap week/month (based on the plex you captured / ihub detroyed / ship killed / ennemy milicia structure...) for ship kill prevent the "farm your alt" by decreasing the LP you gain for killing the same player/day and delay the LP you gain (can't smartbomb XX ship from the same owner and still get the LP)
---
but yeah i agree mission runner are cancer, and i'm a mission runner in FW, i don't give a fuck about the factionnal, i just do mission cause they are lesssss boring than retard anom farm and more interesting isk/h but if they change the way LP are farm (when you pvp only) we probably gonna move in FW &lt;3
---
Bumping them to demand ransom to stop is perfectly fine. Bumping because they don't have a mining permit is perfectly fine. The only thing that is considered harrassment is if the bumper can't come up with an actual reason when asked.
---
Ive honestly never heard of doing that with a strat.
---
**madly searches zkill for... academic purposes**
---
My main toon is flying a proteus, and it's bad? What t3 would be good for me to fly instead? Loki looks pretty sick honestly.
---
&gt;I know that ECM is considered very bad for pvp or shud i say was considered. 
---
Not considered. Is. It is the most overpowered and ridiculous mechanic in the game except for maybe cynos.
---
The nerf is useless. You get jammed from 80km+ and cant target anything. Utterly pointless to try to fight it.
---
&gt;ships like falcon , rook, griffin navy issue , but i dont think anyone was done to save them 
---
Many older ships are obsolete. GNI could be fixed easily, but no one should give a fuck because it was designed and released after it was extremely well known that ECM was a problem. Fuck that ship.
---
How would that be any different than your regular market trading?
---
The solution to logi is more diminishing returns. It is overpowered right now. ECM and damps are anti-content. Being potentially useless is just not an incentive to take a fight.
---
I've heard some wacky, wrong things around here, but this one takes the cake. A good bumper can keep an orca from warping all day long.
---
It would be more based on prediction of future costs? So instead of going out and mining or looting, you buy “stock”. So how the US market has things like price of gold, silver, copper, it would have similar attributes. Or you could invest in a Corp (not necessarily your own) based on whatever they produce. Like buying stock in say Apple. You are not part of the Corp, but you can invest in it. I don’t have all the mechanics down, just a general framework.
---
Actually, they tend to sit out of targeting range, so you still cant do shit.
---
well at least now you have some what of an ability to try and chase them down or reposition previously it was just RNG hates you and you're gonna sit there and take this dick, and you can't fight back
---
begone thot
---
Look, you can go on to ignore my points that I had made, but it is universally known by veteran players, that Hybrid weapons have superiority in the game. I am not a veteran. I was told this, when I tried Amarr weapons, thinking that I wouldn't have to spend money on the charges.

Best thing you can do is watch other streamers and get an idea of what you like and don’t like! Me personally, a clean and organized UI as well as clean audio is extremely important. Not only that but too much overlay/extra stuff on screen is annoying.

As for content, no matter what it is, make sure it’s fun for you and engaging with the people that watch! Viewer engagement and your interaction with them is extremely important. If I jump into your stream and talk and you don’t respond/acknowledge me I most likely won’t stay long!

Those same "people" have been farming that site since forever
---
&gt;My perspective on eve has always been that is is a sandbox resembling real life to a degree, there is a mass economy that can be manipulated and affected by things going on around the universe or by individuals with massive amounts of wealth, there used to even be a stock market aspect with people selling shares of business ventures, there are corporations, alliances, coalitions, and wars that are heavily influenced by politics. There are spys that can bring down an organization from the inside, etc.   
---
&gt;Building the trillions of isk fits along fine with that meta. People aren't building it just to have it. This is a common misconception. People are building it to fortify their space, grow their strength, and get ready for the next great war. People want to use the titans and in fact I have seen many self-destruct the titans and quit the game because they were not being used.   
---
&gt;I disagree with you that everything is unassailable. For one, while small groups like yours may not be able to disrupt the economic backbone, you are very successful at consistently getting super and rorq kills even with the umbrella. It isn't perfect safety. You complain on the unsuccessful attempts that are thwarted by an umbrella as unfair but how is 40 hurricanes fair against one super? Second, it isn't unassailable because other big blocks go to war with each other and they can and do disrupt the economic backbone. Goons have shown this multiple times in the past year with killing Keepstars, camping entire regions, and most recently evicting NC/PL from multiple regions until CCP interrupted with the drifters. That is what eve is about for many, large scale conflict involving thousands of players.   
---
&gt;I also disagree that Goons have won. People used to feel the same about BOB, about NC/PL, and about Goons the first time around before world war bee. Six or so months ago there were plenty of battles where coalitions formed equal or greater titan numbers than Goons and made Goons stand down and blue balls. They are without a doubt the most powerful now but I think the Chinese groups are rapidly catching up and will be able to contest them. Unfortunately, they need hundreds of additional titans to do this. Just like in real life, you need to amass the wealth and build the fleet up all in preparation for the unknown big war that is potentially on the horizon. That is the play style that many enjoy.   
---
&gt;I have a titan and a faction super and use both in combat. I want as many opportunities to actually use them as possible. The game is too far gone to stop the super/titan proliferation. What it needs is ways to induce people to want to risk those assets in ways that they can actually be used and die in pvp. The FAX nerfs will help this along. To me, the biggest impediment is server performance. The last big titan fight it was still whoever loads grid first wins. The servers were miserable before completely crashing. CCP seems to be rapidly addressing these issues with 64-bit and other projects in the works. Once the server can handle it, and once the enemies of the Goons have built enough wealth, there will be another massive fight one day where hundreds (maybe even a thousand) titans will die in one battle that could last up to 24 hours. That is what we are building for and that is what the game needs.   
---
&gt;These big fights set guiness records for most players in a battle in any MMO out there. They get EVE massive publicity with people writing articles about the millions of dollars equivalent that are on the field and dying. They bring back old vets who have been away from the game for years but hear about the fight and want to see what happens and get in on the action. During the TEST Keepstar battle I saw countless vets return and people who had never hear of eve watching on Twitch and asking questions with genuine interest. They put energy back into the game. Unfortunately, they are rare though and take ages for all the stars to allign where both sides have near equal assets and are willing to engage to see who can come out on top.
---
Unpopular Opinion; ECM is in a good place. 
---
It is extremely effective against logi, it can stop other ECM ships, it can stop force multiplier ships like a Bhaal, and if you need it to stop DPS you can combine it with dampeners.

This already exists in the form of commodity trading. Just buy a bunch of something you think is going to increase in price. Wait until it’s price goes up. Sell it.

&gt; crashed into the Kaalakiota mountain range
---
"smote it's ruin upon the Kaalakiota mountainside," I think you meant to say.
---
This. Lots of folks liked to talk about how they had their titan book injected and training waaaayyyy before they had concrete plans to get a hull and fit.
---
Yup Loki for PvP tengu for pve
---
I thought they were implying both were a possibility.
---
Yeah but an average fit was much closer to 500k as it usually was on field before boosts and a Bus dropped (and often enough neither of those was involved)
---
Delete ECM
---
Ships give different bonuses
---
In WINGSPAN it's a meme how much worse the Covert Ops Proteus is than every other T3. Like sure it can put out 900 DPS but they all can now, and the other 3 aren't limited to a shin-kicking range.
---
Some issues (primarily for covops hunting in solo/nano) :
---
* Slow as fuck under every circumstance
---
* Drone subsystem is worse than a Stratios by a huge margin thanks to tiny drone bay
---
* Drone subsystem still gives you high slots for hybrids but the fitting is terrible and DPS anemic. 
---
* It's not like you can fit 6 neuts and support them in any way
---
* Ewar bonus is to scram and point range. Which feels useless when your engagement range is basically zero (blasters) or you're not fast enough to dictate range (drones)
---
* No police skin, no matte black skin
---
* We get it, no mid slots but it makes for a shitty covops fit. 
---
Suggestions:
---
* Maybe drone synth could give more mids instead of highs you can't even use? Make it a utility fitting option?
---
* Change ewar subsystem to DAMPS. This means for blasters you could fit for scan rez so you can smash your 1k DPS for a long time before they can even lock back. And for drones you script for range so you can smash them from 20km while they are helpless
---
* Add cool skins
---
* If you're gonna make a nav subsystem around agility, maybe make the agility good when equipped?
---
That's the overview it doesn't show up in. The sensor overlay(sorry got my terminology mixed up) shows all of the anomalies, sigs, structures etc. in the system. 
---
[https://updates.eveonline.com/card/6ajro/sensor-overlay-2-0/](https://updates.eveonline.com/card/6ajro/sensor-overlay-2-0/) 
---
You can look at the radial display and it will show the tick marks for each one. The structures show up as blue. You can use that to aim your camera and you should see the marker displayed in space the same as anomalies and signatures. You can use that marker to warp to them.
---
Literally any of them are better at everything
---
Maybe there is not a large group of Spanish speakers because the game is not in Spanish.
---
Could that be the cause?
---
We will never know because CCP racist company never plans to implement it.
---
This game every day that passes loses population.
---
Only the obsessed ones of eve remain.
---
You shouldn't feel sorry for a ship where a single one can change the outcome of a 10-20 v 10-20 brawl.
---
Or because the language thats spoken worldwide is English
---
just buff the fitting so it can roll 250s  without needing to fit 2 acrs and look at some speed/inertia buffs (its currently slower than a battleship unironically). The muninn still outclasses it heavily even with those buffs since the prot had its tank put in the dumpster after the t3 changes. Most other pvpers ive talked to would want the t3s brought up to the current loki level of power. They are significant investments in sp as well as isk but are unique hulls that can do multiple things.
---
Having a delay will never ever make your stream popular to more then a few. You already have a very small set of potential viewers. And adding a delay you will get rid of most of them. 
---
You can't have interaction with your viewers when you have a delay.
---
This is good to know, thanks. Disappointing for the above situation, but a man can dream I guess :p
---
Having read all comments, I would like to add something: it's true that it would be great that CCP translates Eve to Spanish to keep rising players number. BTW, they are not forced to. If someone wants to play properly this game, should try to learn some English. And, to be honest, you don't have to speak English properly to play this game in a satisfactory way. And finally, a couple of things : Spanish is not the second language of the world, try to read a little more. Second, if you don't like this game, just get the fuck off. Third, it's a shame for the Spanish community players with you behaviour and shitposting things like you have done ;you could just defend your thinking by writing something respectful and reasonably. Remember that CCP has ways to solve your doubts and questions, and because of that, I think that you are posting here just because you have gross manners or you are just a troll. You have only one thing bigger than your mouth : your stupidity. o7
---
A ver... te puedo preguntar que ha pasado para que llames al juego racista? te han dicho o hecho algo en el juego?

I want to make sure this isnt misunderstanding.  It's not a package deal, the devs get to open up/create APIs for modmakers to use.  I'm coming from World of Tanks, similarly WOW.  I do also very much enjoy the Ui customizations in Rimworld and CDDA.
---
Look for where there are more millions of Spanish speakers than English.
---
Did you know?
---
Also, Eve is in German.
---
GERMAN how many speak German ???
---
Jajajajajajajajajajaja
---
If you do not know about the subject, better not talk.

yes. Please

I still remember that the first time I played EVE I gave up after wasting all my ISK on ammo of wrong size (while wondering why the price was so damn high.)

you should either set your stream on delay on use overlays to censor your location and fit, else youll get blobbed

It really would take forever to seed ships in a C2 to take down a keepstar. The reason they could get that many in a C5 was because the high mass connections allow the use of freighters. A C2 has a much smaller mass limit and only a few passes with battleships will collapse the connection.
---
Disagree entirely. It's good on a few hulls (4 that I can think of: griffin/blackbird/scorpion/kitsune). The actual ecm modules are fairly atrocious. For comparison of unbonused ecm modules:
---
https://imgur.com/LfQpEg2
---
Ecm strength of 5 is utterly atrocious, especially after CCP came up with the idiotic sensor strength skillbooks.
---
Crabs.
---
So? Drop on the destination ansiblex, in range of the keepstar's guns. Let the gunner shoot you. Lose your ship, but get the kills anyways.
---
no problem
---
What is racist about ccp?
---
No fair using facts like that.
---
The majority of market pvp and industry is done on a personal basis, not corp
---
Uhm, I didn’t suggest to have one but to think about it. In my opinion the risk of getting stream-sniped is well worth the content you might get but I guess that’s not for everybody.
---
The German alphabet is quite similar to the Spanish alphabet, with slight differences, it lacks the ñ, but it has 3 letters that the Spanish does not have: ä, ö and ß.
---
My pleasure  
---
Honestly I do think he's a troll, he has another post saying this game is "fueled by the trump administration" (what?), that the reason he doesn't want to learn english is because Spanish is a "far superior language" and that "If God It's real he'll destroy both the servers and the company"...
---
Only it is number 4, not number 2. Facts hurt eh?
---
WTF IS PROTUS
---
More people speak English than Spanish, by a wide margin. English is the second most spoken language in the world after Mandarin. Spanish is after Hindi.
---
ECM is not in a good place. It is terrible. They nerfed the shit out of ECM, which was arguably the only real "tank" ECM ships had, and didn't buff anything else to compensate. 
---
ECM is not use in wormholes by competent players. Neuts are way more effective and used much more than ECM. Even Damps are better to bring than ECM at this point.
---
Did you just assume our servers gender?
---
Skill farms are barely profitable, but they are profitable. Expand your farm to 2500 accounts. Note I say accounts and not pilots because rather than use MPTCs, you'll want the rewards from login events that will happen over the time it will take to grow the farm.
---
 You get just under 4 injectors a month normally, and occasionally you'll get a 4 injector month because of the saved extra SP from the partials. On a month where you will get 4 injectors each, do not sell injectors for plex to pay for omega anymore. Hoard them all and once they are sucked dry sell them on the Character baazar.
---
You should end the month with a little over 5000 injectors. The rewards from the events and the isk from selling the skillgoo pilots should total well over 12t isk alone.
---
Point bonus is worth it. Its not supposed to be better than a t2 in any one category.
---
It provides you with a list of people logged into the system and nothing else. Doesn't tell you if they are active, docked, cloaked, or a variety of other things.
---
Another great contribution
---
Make it so while you have ECM active, it lowers your signature radius. So while targeted ships can only lock you, it takes longer to do so and they have a harder time hitting you. This will keep ECM useful in solo as well since it will be a unique mechanic to lower sig radius. It also gives a tactical reason to hit all your jams at once.
---
It never made sense to me that the Ishtar and VNI had 125mbit of drone bandwidth for 5 heavies but the Proteus didn't.
---
it isn't afk any more, gotta be hitting that V key every 2 seconds.
---
Gf
---
Local provided Intel but there's so much it doesn't tell you. Why do you think afk cloaking works if local was perfect Intel?
---
Any non-racist game after 16 years would have implemented Spanish.
---
If it were only exclusive in English.
---
But it has much less spoken languages than Spanish.
---
STOP DONE WHAT IS OBVIOUS TO CPPH WE DO NOT LIKE THE SPANISH SPEAKERS.
---
&gt;who would have thought
---
literally anyone
---
what happens when you make nullsec subcap pve not worth people's time?

they either upship to caps, or they go and use their subcaps in a place that's worth their time.

By the way, "E INSULTADO" is incorrect. The verb "Haber" (To have), has to be written "HE INSULTADO",with a previous "h". And yes, the Spanish is the second language of the world if we attend the amount of people that speaks it. And I am surprised of it, if we consider that are people that writes it like you. o7
---
&gt; The last use of an orca is a truly AFK miner
---
They have a niche use as a mobile home for nomadic players, particularly in WH space. The combination of a large cargo hold, large fleet hold, ship maintenance bay, and am ore hold means you can store a decent amount of eclectic stuff in them. 
---
I live out of mine in WH space, using it as a hangar and loot stash while my main kills sleepers/huffs gas/hacks sites. Only reason I ever hop back into k-space is to grab more ammo and do deposit loot.
---
Clarify this for me: Are people wanting a solo proteus that isn’t just a hunter to open cyno for friends?
---
Sorry, but anyone who quits because they were able to create as many free accounts as they please, is going to quit anyway.
---
Blaming a game mechanic for forcing people to leave is retarded.
---
New players are heavily influenced by the people they do or do not meet in game, it's the social interaction and encouragement that plays the biggest part in inspiring new members, and attitudes like "Oh bro, it's such a shitty mechanic. It's punishing new guys like you. So many people just quit." is a surefire way of putting new people in a downer.
---
12 Trillion! Wow! Bit I mean how will you even be able to have so many alts? That means coming up with 2500 names, emails, etc. It's a hassle.
---
And all the SP ever injected. Refund accordingly.
---
Why is the point bonus worth it? Specifically for the situation I describe? Covert Ops allows you to dictate initial engagement range.
---
Give the fleet battleships damage modifiers against capital hulls.
---
Farther. Not further
---
I remember a moron in a proteus once baiting noobs with cans and killing them in one of the starter systems, when I told him to fuck off he didn't so I called someone from the help channel to kick him out.  
---
I then got kicked from a small corp for causing a "diplomatic incident".  
---
I was like 1 out of 5 people that were active in said corp XD
---
Then because it is also in Russian and German French.
---
Is not English spoken all over the world?
---
What differentiates those languages from Spanish, yes! They are spoken by far fewer people.

100 megabits it's fine, it is the Drone Bay that killed it. You just can't carry a large enough variety of drones to be useful, or to win drone attrition combat. Look at the stratios. It does great with a hundred megabytes, but it has a huge drone Bay.
---
ECM ships should have gotten the same adjustments that drones received. Make the jam time a bonus of the hull. Smaller ships have a lower jam time and shorter range. Larger ships get more jam time and longer range. The cycle time for the module would be a fixed time so you would only be jammed for a portion of the cycle time based on the ship bonus. 
---
As it is now, ships that rely on ECM for their main utility or defense are in a really poor place. Griffin Navy Issue lost their main utility bonus. It's completely pointless now due to the fact that a jammed target can still target you. The same goes for the Widow. 
---
The rest of the ECM ships have a very weak tank due to the fact that ECM was part of their "tank". This is now no longer true given that the ships you jam can target you. Being a counter to logi is a weak argument given that as soon as you jam a logi you'll be primaried. Having no tank means that you will die very quickly. You'll have about 1 jam cycle of usefulness in a fight before you're forced off field or killed.  Bringing any other utility ship would make more sense than ECM as it is now.

OP, you have a problem of  courtesy and patience  I am Mexican and speak spanish and english; i am the owner of the only Spanish blog about Eve with regular updates ( [https://inactiveseller.wordpress.com](https://inactiveseller.wordpress.com) ) with more than 500 posts and two years . I live as a Programmer (ruby/php) and get money for programming since 1991. I am 47 years old.
---
In the past i already do  programs that work in several languages (spanissh enlish and portuguese), and translate a games is not easy and is not peanuts. Translations are CHEAP if you have motivated people. The problem in games are based in memory, strings, resource files. Spanish is problematic because the graphics normally have not enough space to the strings. Example "coche rojo" have more letters than red car. Then you need more memory and  slightly different  graphics to make space for the pixels to the extra letters. We are USERS of a complex VERBOSE  beautiful and ornate language  with specific needs for translate for the technical reasons i say. Not all the 
---
screens can read the resource files or the database and adapt. Games need many times malloc or direct similar memory functions and the length of a word can have many implications in a pointer in language c .
---
And good customers ? LOL. I am in the upper part of my country with around 60,000 USD yearly; but many people here and in all south america are worst. In spain the 1000 euros (mileurista) is a reality.  Our Hispanic heritage does not normally translate into the ability to buy, but rather the desire to buy, and being rude is not going to help anyone
---
I sign any petition to spanish translation because my own wife and one of my sons dont want play a game in english, but iun that case maybe i will need to stop one of my current 10 oemgas (4 subscription 6 plexed).
---
I play alone because not like the  behavior  of groups as ARSENICO, and like more Union Libre and rekium (not part of rekium but interestested in maybe soon)

En el pasado he hecho programas que usan inglés español y portugués y traducir juegos no es precisamente barati. Traducciones pueden ser baratas si tienes personas motivadas, pero los problemas en juegos estan basados en memoria, cadan y archivos de recurso. El español es problemático porque las graficas normalmente no tienen suficient espacio para las cadenas de texto. Ejemplo, coche rojo es mas largo que "red car"; por lo mismo necesitas mas memoria y pequeños cambios en las graficas para hacer espacio a las letras sobrantes, y eso si no hay otros problemas. Nosotros somos los USUARIOS de un lenguaje COMPLEJO , bello y complicado con necesidades específicas en la traducción por las razones técnicas que he dicho. No todas las pantallas pueden leer archivos de recursoso o bases de datos y adaptarse. Los juegos necesitan muchas veces llamadas a Malloc in C o funciones similares de memoria y el largo de una palabra puede tener implicaciones en el largo de un puntero en lenguaje C.
---
Buenos CLientes ?'? LOL Estoy en mi pais en lo que llaman clase alta y solo gano 60 mil dolares al año, pero muchas personas aqui y en sudamerica estan peor. En españa los mileuristas (1000 euros) son una realidad. Nuestra herencia hispana No se traduce en la habilidad de comporar sino en el deseo de comprar, y ser grosero no le sirve a nadie.
---
Yo firmaria cualquier peticion de vee en español, porque mi esposa y uno de mis hijos no juegan juegos en inglés, pero n ese caso probablemente debería detener una de mis 10 cuentas (4 cash 6 plexes).
---
Juego solo porque no me gusta la actitud de grupos como ARSENICO y prefiero l oque hacen union libre y rekium 8no soy parte de rerekium peor quiza entre en un tiempo.
---
I mean, there is not much you can do about that.    
---
At least have ships and a route in mind (dotlan data for example) before starting goes a long way.
---
Maybe because the game is not in Spanish?
---
SERA PORQUE EL JUEGO NO ESTA EN ESPAÑOL. COML YO HAY MILLO ES QUE NUNCA JUGARIAN A UN JUEGO RACISYA COML EVE

You say that, and yet I see streams like this with 60+ viewers.... May e that is really what eve nerds want to see.
---
That's pretty-much the only answer you need, right there.    
---
If you think the real world stock markets and investments are a solid and interesting mechanic that might translate well in-game, just stop and ask yourself how well the real world stock markets would function if scamming and sabotage were perfectly legal.
---
Man, you're either an A grade troll or a genuine retard. In both cases arguing is pointless.
---
CCP talk with those yes that really is wasting time.
---
CCPh does not respond to Spanish speakers.
---
Check it

Maybe they can make T3C doomsdays; so you can warp in cloaky and nullified and doomsday carriers and supers. Would that make it easy enough?

Don't use a delay.... It's not that big of a deal tbh and it will hurt your stream. If you want to hide your system info due to stream snipers let me know in dm.

Honestly, audio and video go a long way. Watch your vods to see if you'd watch you.

Can you buy injector narcan to reverse the blackout? Of course, this would incur a 30 day block on injection as well.
---
And we could open injector rehab clinics in derelik, where addicts could be weaned off using a 12 step that would slowly allow your training rate to recover!

CCPlease!
---
It's almost one of the races in Starcraft.
---
What good is a point bonus when you can't dictate range in that slow ass lard butt of a ship?
---
The Proteus used to be the best solo covert Ops hunting Ship by a long shot. With the redesign it lost most of its tank and the other T3Cs were buffed as covops, making the Proteus the worst choice, even worse than a Stratios in many circumstances.
---
Do not fight only against the eve fanboys.
---
Eve has been racist for 13 years now, ignoring the Hispanic community.
---
So fit it in was which there's 50 better cheaper hulls to do the same?
---
Gallente is the only t3c I don't religiously keep all 5's in subsystems
---
I think that ECM as mechanics is fine, however some ships need adjustment.
---
- Griffin: no opinion as i never even theorized to use it
---
- Griffin Navy Issue: i think to fix it CCP either has to introduce 2nd caldari ewar and rework GNI to focus on it, or change ECM mechanics on this ship specifically, a-la blood raider ships. For example - first 5 seconds of cycle it jamms target altogether, and the rest of cycle it works like regular jamm (or 2 seconds old jamm + 8 cycle new jamm, i.e. effectively reduce cycle time to 10 seconds for more annoyance)
---
- Kitsune: i feel it's fine as-is, very fast, agile, can jamm from 100k-ish range. I am using it in notank fit from time to time against fighters and against logies
---
- Rook and falcon: both are probably alright. We were using them as effectively "taunt" ships vs carriers - with decent sigtank (10mn + halo/snake or 100mn + genolutions) if enemy focuses on rook/falcon, then they do not apply their fighter DPS onto cyno inhib or battleships which have less effective tank, with sigtank considered. If they do not focus rook/falcon - they lose dps of 6 fighters (DG multispecs reliably jamm any fighter squad). Also can be used for wormhole brawls vs logistics. Rook might need some help as it's not much better than falcon
---
- Tengu - idk, no opinion on it apart from "meh" jamm strength
---
- Widow - partially suffers from the same issue as GNI, it's quite close-range ship for its class with huge sig (so cannot fullfill role such as rook/falcon). Might make use of the same fix

lokis for pretty much everything except being a brick tanked slaved neuting snail, thats the legion's job. If you're happy flying the prot who cares, but if you do yeah. I guess some people use tengus as hunter killers for covops but lmao hks 2k19
---
Which fighters are the ones with smartbombs? I need to get some of these
---
Dramatic much
---
I'm just wishing for a Triglavian T3.....
---
.........code is the nullbears
---
Once insulted, you lose all reason.
---
Keep defending the company that invests your money in trash and not in improving eve.
---
Because they are.
---
20 dudes and you couldn’t bring enough to tank some fighters? Obviously you didn’t try very hard. Post is basically “wah game too hard”
---
I wasted time flying over 50 jumps in null.  I didn't see anyone ratting in less than a carrier.  And that was under an super umbrella with faxes.
---
20 dudes that were on grid. We had roughly even numbers.
---
Please replace “zerg” with “blob”.
---
This is the best change CCP have made in YEARS. Space should be a dangerous place, adapt or die.
---
Lol
---
 "you need a cap fleet to fight 50 Kiki's or squad of t3c's"
---
Such a goonie statement. 
---
Maybe you need caps to fight dessies and cruisers because.... You're really, really bad and only play ez mode.
---
I still see trashposting
---
When you figure out which ammo size you need, [here's](https://i.imgur.com/ggeXzka.png) a helpful chart for if/when you skill up for missiles!

&gt; &gt; &gt; and lets face it, you need caps to fight 50 kikis
---
&gt; &gt; just bring 50 kikis lmao
---
&gt; why should i bring 50 kikis
---
fascinating
---
Honestly, the "trading" comments here kind of pissed me off. Why should the attacker be trading *any* losses for a bunch of unescorted freighters assuming no QRF, just because someone is sitting in a station? Stupid.
---
I think you are working under the assumption that nullbears are somehow good at the game and harder to kill than highbears?
---
They aren't, nullbears created their safespace because they are garbage without it. 
---
CODE will clean the floor with them, just like they do in all of their one sided engagements.
---
Try to fit it for almost anything. It's fucking terrible. 
---
Want to be able to fit tackle? You can't fit any utility
---
Want to fit DPS? You're going to have the tank of a T1 cruiser
---
Want to fit tank? You're going to have worse DPS than some destroyers. 
---
I know there are trade-offs in fitting, you can't have everything be great, but the Proteus is by far one of the worst ships to fit up. One of the only real uses, that's already been pointed out, is using it for mission running. It can fit a cloak and have enough DPS and an active tank to run some missions in low/null. 
---
The Proteus is just the worst of the bunch though. All of the T3 cruisers got a swift kick in the balls once Null groups started using them in big fleets. The Loki shines because it can actually fit a decent tank, some utility, and still put out a fair amount of DPS. I wouldn't risk the loss of SP on the rest of them though. 
---
\*The Tengu is still an alright PvE boat.
---
That's actually a bannable offense (or it used to be when I played years ago).
---
Do you take into account that neither French nor German is on that list?
---
Triple box hawks. 150m in ships + character investment. Could even clear the World Ark room.
---
I think exactly the same.
---
I do not play Eve because she is not in Spanish.
---
I like the game but my friends do not want to play a racist game like eve either.
---
Yup. That is a good thing. You have now to actually play the game to play eve.
---
It's sad as shit to be honest.
---
Delete ecm, or better. Make ECM stupid strong against capitals and work against nothing else, give those ships a sign radius of 5 and the ab buff of a sansha ship.
---
Watch the capital and ecm dingleberries flail at each other, would be pleasing.
---
We'd rather they train into and purchase capitals, so they add to our fleet and fleet-in-being.
---
I sold mine at 750 mill a while back. Did I win EVE?
---
Proteus isn't actually that bad, given it is the only T3C with access to the Hyperspatial Optimiser. 
---
Now this doesn't at all help with "proper awesome pvp" where people actually want to take fights, but used as a covops hunter \*or\* solo hunter, this prop system is god mode enabled all by itself, presuming you are willing to do without nullification.
---
If I ever made a solo hunting video it would feature why off-grid speed (align &amp; warp) is so critically under-valued in catching things. The Proteus is the only ship you can put together with a 10AU warp, &lt;4s align and enough tank - all at the same time (+clone ofc) - to face-tank a kinetic super-carrier while immobilised by your own cyno.
---
Niche, granted, but I love my proteus (this post written from the bridge of my Loki roaming in Delve, which is simply far safer due to the engagement bubble &amp; nullification)
---
Current total SP needed to train everything is 518,400,000.
---
You're awful.
---
A Eve le queda 1 o 2 años buenos.
---
Pero como solo invierten en basura en plan: Eve echoes, infinite galaxy....
---
Lo peor es que los fanboys defienden a la compañía CPPH cuando no mejora EVE.
---
Con la falta que le hace atraer a nuevos jugadores que aporten su dinero.
---
Mejor que gasten el dinero ganado en eve en Eve Candy crash
---
tl;dr: other than objectives that matter we still F1 each other guys.
---
because they're scared and feel entitled to no risk no effort  isk, an afk vni would have lost his ship with or without local, active subcap ratters can get out pretty easily too, but then they'd need to press more than 3 buttons per site. There is zero reason someone in a domi for one can't leave the site before warp deceleration ends on the hunter since its aligned, and that's ignoring dscan 100%. And if they do catch you maybe with a sb(no cloak module delay) there are those highs on the ship that could house those things that cap out frigs quite easily, and another thing in the mids too...
---
and lets say you do get caught and cant get out, it happens, but how much did you lose at that point again? insured t1 ships are dirt cheap.
---
tldr: pve people are overreacting egged on by lazy ratters thst can't stand actually playing the game
---
My plan is that, but it takes time.
---
I've seen freighters titan bridged. Your argument is invalid.
---
Mass is an important part of the bumping calculation.
---
This would solve all it's issues! CCP; Make it so!
---
&gt; maybe as a FW mission runner (see Olmeca's videos)
---
dude thats the t3d hecate lmao
---
Anybody with a brain saw this coming
---
All the blackout does is cause members of small alliances to either go to high sec for isk making or fold into a large alliance to benefit from a super umbrella. There, anything with a cyno gets saved.
---
People are enjoying it right now because of the confusion related to the event. It’s new and fresh and lots of people probably havent figured out how to dscan.
---
Why was this downvoted citadels truly are aids and need to be shot
---
0-5m SP - 10 injectors.
---
Add 45m SP at 400000 each to hit 50m SP - 112.5
---
Add 30m SP at 300000 each to hit 80m SP - 100
---
Add 438.4m SP at 150000 each to hit 518,400,000 - 2922.66
---
Rounding level 2 and 4 down because of starting SP leaves you 3144 injectors needed to inject everything.
---
This does also include skills like Astronautic Engineering which was 12b last I saw and that was IF you could even find one.  
---
Someone else total how much isk is needed for all the skill books.
---
I'm going to bet he just subbed 3 months and thought the MCT applied automatically. He probably didn't read that you have to add the MCT for $1
---
Why? The risk is nearly zero when there is no blackout
---
The blackout isn't intended as a punishment.  Its to make the game more interesting and healthy
---
🚨 *DISPATCH* 🚨 
---
We have a code 11, Shots fired, I repeat shots fired.
---
🚑 🚒
---
No, its too high as it is
---
Ive gotten a few kills in my WH with my proteus with relative ease. Have yet to even try to go hunting anywhere outside of WHs. But its been about 6 months since i was playing regularly, came back with the blackout going to be doing frig/t3 destroyer pvp for a bit so im not losing 1b+ isk on ships trying to learn to pvp.
---
 **CCP is saving our game. Prove me wrong.**   
---
You think script writers won't adapt to these changes and develop new bots in a few weeks? If they can develop scripts that work with local, why not d-scan? It's not exactly a feat, these are pretty simply programs. It's a reflex agent AI a freshmen CS student could write, not some kind of ground breaking skynet technology. I don't think blasting an entire tripod of gameplay interaction by turning null sec into another form of WH space just to eliminate a small percentage of people that bot is the answer. A small percentage of folks make a magnitude greater isk by adding zeros to their sell orders. Shall we eliminate market transactions for player specified amounts and instead mandate all prices based on averages?  
---
**This is all irrelevant anyway**  
---
Take a look at the player count charts. If drifter invasions and local blackouts were a golden ticket, I'd expect to see positive trends with less decay by now. Instead you see a small spike that immediately fell off. People wanna get in for a few 'tee hee' kills on some easy newbro rorqs in null, sure. The thrill fades, however. Burn Jita doesn't last 6 months either.   
---
Our problem isn't bots. It's **New Player Retention**. What do we have to offer? Why is our Player count dipping below 30k. Why did CCP decide 2018 was a good time to sell out to Pearl abyss. Read the writing on the wall while you cheer the collapse of bots.
---
atfer insurance + loot is what is used for ganks and BCs insure p damn good last i checked
---
no you don't.
---
you just go to somwehere that isn't null for better isk:effort.
---
Why?
---
CONCORD voids insurance, please don’t make stupid statements :)
---
there is a guy who bots incursions with a shit ton of rattlesnakes , He's been doing this for years in safety, no amount of reporting stopped his actions despite proof a plenty being sent to CCP 
---
Personally witnessed him input broadcasting and turning on all the rattles dps at once. 
---
He makes ALOT of isk and LP (In fact he crashed LP from 2k &gt; 1k/lp by himself)
---
I would definitely add interceptors to your list.
---
If you're a paper, then logo alts are always useful
---
proteus are fine, just fit faction scram and web on him.
---
Good job the VNI is getting changed to a PVP boat then!
---
Adapt or die
---
Proteus is actual garbage at this point.  I have perfect proteus skills and I wont touch the thing.  Stratios is way more bang for the buck.   If only they could fit a cov ops cyno, seems like bullshit that they cant honestly.
---
You would think that, but after a while of being constantly bombarded and smothered with boobs, you realize you wont be able to do anything else for the rest of time. Cant drive to work cause tits constantly in your face. Hard to eat when you unintentionally motorboat 24/7. Eventually you lose all interest in boobs cause due to the constant bombardment of the mammaries, they just become more annoying than exciting. Take head this tale of cascading tatas and be careful of the hubris in the words you wish.
---
I like  it too but more as an visual thing to make the market look like an market.
---
Unfortunately you are not the first nor last who got a bit of skills wasted because of mechanics change. My friend left the game a long time ago because he was new and CCP changed skill requirements for ships he was training to. Twice if I remember correctly. By my opinion they should unload skill points from affected skills to unallocated when changed any mechanic so people could decide if they still want those skills or should re-invest sp in something else.
---
But don't let this loss blind you. ECM was one of the worst mechanics EVE ever has, because it required literally no personal skill and was overpowered. Right now it's still bad, but now you could at least beat all the shit from the dude who permajamming you. That's something.
---
Don't cry over your ECM skills. My advice - farm for skill extractors and re-inject yourself or sell skill injectors.
---
He's actually right, and you are wrong
---
Bring back ABC ratting
---
They always were highsec carebears. They just found a safer place than highsec for a while.
---
Is that actual less loot, or are more people running abyssals now?
---
So, what you're trying to say is spooling down a MWD after a cycle you will \*always\* warp slower?
---
Yeah the Legion is pretty well a better drone boat.
---
It feels like less loot overall. Fewer mutas, less building materials. Ive stopped running them in favor of invasions.
---
You're bad and you should feel bad. Understand more about mechanics before trying to give advice
---
I'm not in goons?  We did have a Kiki fleet attack a while ago, and like I said, subcaps struggled with their DPS. 
---
&gt;Maybe you need caps to fight dessies and cruisers because.... You're really, really bad and only play ez mode.
---
What a low IQ statement. No, we need the same numbers they have. If these numbers aren't available, we need ships that can soak up their DPS / dish out far more in return. Or we can hope they're trash tier pilots who forgot to bring ammo. These are your options.
---
Where can I find said planet sized blob of wrecks I need salvage for making rigs.
---
Or just tripple box them in 3 frigates with ~80m each for 1b per hour profit.
---
yes gankers have a right to be safe, danger is for the person without the guns ¬\_¬
---
unelss there's a good reason why the most efficient way to obtain isk in a subcap needs to be kept in null, i don't see any reason why we should.
---
Lost an empty, naked,  kryos at Jita dock the other day. 500k after insurance and sold a kill right for 5 mil. Cost him a 80 mil tornado. Sometimes logic has nothing to do with it.
---
can we nominate this for the "shitpost of the year award 2019" ?
---
So it took a high skill point t3c  and a high sp blood to kill what was likely a new player, in an unarmed ship.
---
Cloaks online sure is a great game.
---
lol hi
---
No, he uses a Drone Proteus and talks about how he likes it more than other drone boats
---
https://youtu.be/o7DgE0EKGiw
---
True, I forgot about that usage too.
---
Sounds like a wornhole
---
Yes. But it get right. Less effort, less reward. 
---
Until now nullsec were Zero effort, almost no risk, and best reward.
---
People can still burn out of the point range.
---
subcap ratting in null wasn't the best reward, it was like 60m/hour before corp taxes.
---
it was a fairly low isk/hour to beat, it was just really really low effort that's why it was so prevalent.
---
You don't need to convo anyone actually, the map has the ability to show fleet members in space.
---
If I had been in a Merlin, I would have killed it with a Merlin, but I wasn't. /shrug
---
Covert ops cloak allows you to dictate initial engagement range.
---
Ah solo uboat gameplay lol.
---
The Noctis was working in conjunction with a HAW Naglfar. The “think of the new players element” of your post is irrelevant.
---
The HAW Naglfar and the Noctis would not have been out in space had they seen my “known hotdropper” alt in local. Eve is a better game now than it was last month.
---
A strike on strategic assets in null is not "ganking".
---
Can you salvage with out worrying about the rats?
---
People are just playing the games how they want to.  Just because they chose not to participate in your or my activity of choice does not make them garbage.
---
"a strike" shooting "strategic assets" undefended shit heap "is not ganking" actually yes, yes it is
---
&gt;**The following is a dramatization of a conversation I had with my wife.**
---
says who?  I think abyssal space fits fine in the eve lore.   The cancer kids already kicked 99% of the kids out of the your alleged sandbox so the game is dead and empty.   You've basically shit and pissed in your sandbox so much that no body plays in it.  May as well make a secure part of that sandbox for people to actually play and have fun; let all the shitlers that think everything should remain how it has been play with their dicks in empty space. (PS, it wouldn't become empty, it would remain empty as it currently is.)
---
No. 
---
Spool MWD for one cycle to accelerate your ship, then turn it off and you should be at speed to enter warp. This  will help to get you in to warp faster with larger ships.  
---
I think what he was pointing out is that you could have explained the MWD trick to the other person rather than trying to insult them. It sounds like they didn't know about the trick and they were simply saying "Hey, if you are running a prop mod it will take longer to warp", which in most situations is correct. 
---
TLDR-You could have explained it without being a prick.
---
So, if you do anything besides pvp then you're carebear? I wonder who pays for your ships.
---
yes, I, too, use subcaps to fight a group of 50 800+ DPS destroyers which are capable of alphaing any subcap in the game off the field, and ends up needing to have split target callers because otherwise most of the fleet's DPS goes to waste.
---
Surely that means that the range bonus is less useful then mobility?
---
it still is 
---
newbies in starter systems are protected
---
Yes, but if the number goes from 20 to 40 you can be pretty sure a fleet of neutrals just entered your system and you had better dock up boi.
---
&gt; Goons only use capitals and supercaps.
---
Are you even playing the same game? The state bird of Delve is a suicidal T1 frigate.
---
How? 8 unescorted freighters should be a slam dunk, no losses, lootfest.
---
People often try to burn out of point range.
---
\&gt; Cant drive to work cause tits constantly in your face 
---
this is a blessing not a curse
---
How do you not die? I'm assuming you have a cloak on the orca?
---
so.. because it could be a new player, noone is allowed to kill him? fml...
---
HCrabs, LCrabs, NCrabs, WCrabs.
---
yeah sorry my bad
---
I thought everyone was supposed to start ratting in carriers because it was the only safe way in the blackout.
---
Have goons been telling lies? :o
---
I thought so! Was wondering why they were so shit now.
---
Who said that?
---
Docking permission requested.
---
Docking request accepted.
---
THE CIRCLE OF LIFE CONTINUES
---
ah my bad  not often in highsec 
---
arent buffer gilas only good for L3s anyways ? i always assumed the majority of gankworthy targets are the L4 and 5 runners in blingy avtive tank stuff
---
*raises spork*
---
Ansiplex gates are a joke like 95% of eve community.
---
They aren't though, you just made up your own definition along with the other few people that don't like that players would leave dead and boring space to actually have fun.   You can always write in sandbox lore exactly how they did Abyssal space and it maintains said sandbox qualifications.  CCP defines the rules of said sandbox, we interact under those laws however we see fit.   
---
I've often thought it would be interesting for them to add in something like simulation mode, where the cost of said simulation is a ship hull w/ fittings as the cost of entry.  100v100 rifter battles, 200 rifters sucked out of the economy, something like that.  I don't even think "real sandbox" space as you call it would even lose players, it might even see more players, because after you are fighting in simulation for so long, you would want to actually go fly in "real" space and be able to kill and obtain loot from your enemies, instead of plugging your wealth away into the simulation.    
---
Lets not kid ourselves anyway, almost all of space is already empty anyway because of the cancerous tactics groups have developed over the years.  I get it, it works, KB is green, you don't lose anything, but the result is a nearly empty universe and players flocking to other games because of the huge amount of effort and little payback you get from roaming an empty universe.
---
How stoned are you?
---
&gt;I thought everyone was supposed to start ratting in carriers because it was the only safe way in the blackout.
---
Many people don't have carriers though, contrary to what this sub seems to think.
---
Kiki doesn't have an 800 dps alpha my dude.
---
And yeah of course you don't, that would require you to be able to play the game. Why not just use the ez button and drop caps, keep mining.
---
Garbage in the sense that they have garbage PvP skills in a PvP game, not that they are garbage humans haha. It's ok if they don't want to be decent at PvP, but they're still garbage at it and will get wrecked by groups like code that gank low skill players for fun.
---
So that's why I can't find any Gurista Scout Outposts!
---
Goons, test, brave, meh - all the same just different levels of ability, nullbear if you prefer that term?
---
But yeah, most nullbears in eve are like you describe "the fight was hard with subcaps, we don't do hard so we brought caps, then it was we easy, we like easy, now we can go back to mining and afk ratting".
---
See this is useful!
---
&gt;ccp is saving our game
---
&gt;this is the eve I wanted
---
Literally said i was willing for people to come to me when i had local in nulsec. Half of /r/eve needs to go back to grade school and work on reading comprehension.
---
You could probably argue these days that pvp has become a niche activity and industry/pve is the more dominant activity. At least I think that was the case until the blackout.
---
3x Core Field Purger II’s. Sorry I cant believe I managed to forget that lol
---
To some degree. However, you have to wait out the initial targeting delay and then lock time to even be able to engage.  Given the limited midslots, you don't have any room for utility like a sensor booster if you want to fit proper tackle.  This gives the target enough time to pull range while you're trying to maneuver in what amounts to a brick, minus the tank. 
---
The Proteus as it is now has terrible agility. In fact, it's by far the worst of any of the T3s. That means it accelerates to warp slower and maneuvers slower. Add any modules or rigs that penalize that, and it just gets worse.  Given that it's armor tanked, that's almost guaranteed in all but a few fits. 
---
The general consensus that the Proteus is shit is for good reason. None of the bonuses make up for its many drawbacks.
---
yes thats the point , If u are making the ships now as a taunt u need to compensate the ships else ppl like me who went for caldari ships have 6 ships that are waste except very few scnerios
---
People such as yourself come on every week claiming that a dangerous nullsec would increase population. Or at least increase fights. This is verifiably false.
---
You have already proven that you're only interested in having a one sided engagement. Otherwise you would have engaged the freighters. It is laughable that you think that you should give to kill anything and everything in said bomber.
---
The average player is not looking for fights. That is the unfortunate truth. Causing nullsec to be more dangerous will lower null Sec population. Look at wormhole and low security space, they are dead.
---
i dont mind getting a new ewar , just make ships like falcon and kitsune , griffin navy issue more viable in pvp compared to other similar ships
---
&gt; I'm assuming you have a cloak on the orca?
---
You 1000% need to be cloaked in a safe at all times you aren't either moving the Orca or accessing a bay, yes. You'll also want a MWD so accelerating to warp doesn't take eight years. When moving it around, you'll want to ship into your explo frigate and use that character as your scout before actually going anywhere. And of course, have a basic scanner on the Orca in case your main dude gets slapped and you need a way out. 
---
There's also the fact that I play off of peak times, so the space is just generally pretty empty.
---
Good question, this was what I asked myself when reading the OP...
---
They have buffed PVP only and have single handed killed Mining. I have seen so many miners talk about waiting until the blackout has lifted or they leave Eve. They do not speak up for being verbally raped by the PVPers. When all the miners are gone and no one can make good isk....game dies. I will be another that leaves the game if they do not kill this soon.
---
Yes one bump and that Orca will never stop moving if you fit a higgs rig.  I hope you are being accidentally obtuse.
---
I think it has a lot more to do with the accessibility of Eve in some Spanish speaking countries. Hard to play Eve in a tin sheet hut. Whereas sure less people speak German than Spanish, but a much higher percentage of those that speak it have ease of access and play Eve.
---
But that's thing, thats all it tells you, there is so much information it doesn't give, so it's not perfect. It's adequate for what it does.
---
I think you're right.
---
brother many big ships like falcon and widow have very low agility and align time so even if they sit far , many ships can close the distance which removed th point of sitting away
---
Orbit a rock and use an AB and most 100mn mwd ships will miss
---
small ships like griffins are best ecm ships as per my understand anthing above cruiser like falcon rook widow , are too slow to use ecm and taunt and get away as per my understanding
---
i totally agree , there was never a compenasation given to the ecm nerf as per my thinking which is like 1 kind of ships being just useless
---
How does the mass of an oversized ab affect your ship compared to sig bloom of mwd and what is the difference in speed?
---
&gt;Can Alpha level clones run L4s? I think the problem are Alpha clone bots, not omegas chars (from CCPs perspective at least).
---
I assume this would be only lowering sig towards the one ship being ECM'd? Otherwise, this might lead to some weird OP ships where a small gang bring a logi ship that they ECM on just to lower their sig massively.
---
Sometimes....in the fitting window....when you try to change ammo types (of the correct size and type) you get this same message if you drag and drop the ammo on your ship instead of on the gun icon.
---
Scramweb from &gt;15km and your fatass just might keep up with them
---
You're getting caught by a bunch of Titans/ supers? 
---
I'm not sure where you hang out, but I've almost never seen a gate camp with a bunch of capitals just hanging out. The occasional carrier drop, sure, but nothing more than that.
---
Ah right that makes sense. I'm not a big fan of pve so I wouldn't do it, but it sounds interesting.
---
Around 60mil/h is good isk.
---
Yo soy latinoamericano y nunca tuve ningún problema ni con la compañía ni con otros jugadores por ello, ni me sentí discriminado de forma alguna.
---
La traducción hispana del juego estaría buena (porque abriría el juego a nuevos mercados, lo mismo se aplica a otros idiomas), pero para serte sincero yo seguiría jugándolo en inglés (porque estoy acostumbrado y manejo el idioma; algo que podrías hacer, es muy útil). Igualmente, como siempre, la comunidad logró suplir las falencias de CCP y existen páginas, grupos de chat/discord, alianzas y corporaciones, así como jugadores solos que se comunican en español.
---
Así que hacele un favor a la humanidad y dejá de ser tan idiota.
---
------
---
I'm latinamerican and never had a single problem with the company or with other players because of it, nor I felt discriminated in any way.
---
A hispanic translation would be nice (because it would open the game to new markets, which also applies to other languages), but tbh I would still play it in english (because I'm used to it and handle the language; something you could do, very useful). Anyway, as usual, the community managed to cover CCP's shortcomings, and there are sites, chat groups/discord, alliances and corps, as solo players that communicate in english.
---
So do humanity a favour and stop being such an idiot.
---
These statements aren't contradictory.
---
If you don't have a cap or a super it is very difficult to live in null because any tackled subcap dies before help gets there.
---
If you do have a significant amount of caps and supers you drop on everything trying to kill your supers.
---
It's entrenched people who have supers because there's less competition for them, and it's made life for people without much harder, to the point that they probably need highsec/FW alts to make money with.
---
Wormhole space has always been like that. If you like it, move there.
---
your reddit username is ironic
---
&gt;But yeah, most nullbears in eve are like you describe "the fight was hard with subcaps, we don't do hard so we brought caps, then it was we easy, we like easy, now we can go back to mining and afk ratting".
---
Did you miss the part where I mentioned not having enough numbers being a factor. Also assuming anyone who rats is AFK makes no sense. 
---
Less numbers than the enemy mean you need to escalate or lose. That's the simplest way to put it. Skill matters, sure, but not as much as numbers, or ships. 
---
Also an attacking fleet only attacks something they're stronger than. They aren't looking for fights, they're looking for easy kills. Why shouldn't you respond the same way?
---
The day enemy fleets give us their numbers and ships so we can all warp to the sun at 0 and have a nice fair, with a neutral titan standing by to referree an even fight is the day I'll feel bad about dropping bigger blappier ships on someone who just got 50 people to go hunt VNI's and lucked upon a rorq. Defending your space isn't about having a jolly ol skirmish. It's about making xx_3leet4uPvP_xx regret his choice to go VNI hunting in your region.
---
Then your PVP boat gets wrecked by the rats, or you get ticks low enough that you make better isk in Highsec.
---
Bring back TECH 3 resists! Why were they even removed in the first place? t3s are supposed to be highly expensive cruisers you can configure into different modes not a fucking downgrade from t2 or faction
---
Wow,super easy to tell you were being sarcastic and not just a knob from the inflection and tone of your voice, which are usually used to determine sarcasm. /s
---
I dont mind have any issues with kitsune and griffin as being small they can align anf ping easily , my issue starts for ships above that rook and falcon u said are ok but i think they are not agile enough or tanky enough(from ship bonuses) to be considered a good ecm ship. And i am not considering the fight with fighters but normal small gang pvp. Compared to other specialized recon ships i think these 2 are at the worst part . I opened falcon and had bought it quite sometime ago but when i asked my allince . they said dont even bother using it , No use .
---
For Griffin navy issue i agree with you. that 5 sec complete jam could solve the whole ecm issue as 5sec is enough for quite a lot of ships to handle a warp off or ping
---
widow would also love the same fix . issue is the fix u gave can actually be sued to insta lock a ship if other ecm is locking before previous 5 sec is completed
---
Being aligned is only marginally useful against bomber points since they warp cloaked.
---
Supercarriers*
---
Imo if all ecm had aoe it could be viable
---
Doesnt really happen like that. They wont solo in a falcon.
---
Yup yup yup, keep defending your pixel space duder. Have fun mining and ratting.
---
bro you have to take into consideration that for ships like rook and falcon and widow the align time and agility is quite low. to use same tactic as griffin on which ecm is still viable
---
Just get better at it then
---
Brother do u normaly fit missiles on a non missile ship , reason: no bonus for it . Thats the point normally people try to make ship fits base don bonuses to get most out of them . Issue is this bonus is useless except few ships like kitsune or griffin
---
I'd like to achieve the shitLords fighting amongst themselves, haha.
---
I did not know that you get along well with each person in your country.
---
You are very lucky.
---
Tanslation: "leave our perfect intel alone! don't celebrate the blackout or CCP will make it permanet!"
---
Yes, just towards the ship you're targeting.
---
&gt; ECM is not used in wormholes by competent players
---
This is 100% false.
---
People like you and me are going to find something to bitch about no matter what, so screw us this is awesome
---
i received it via directly applied to account
---
What else you gonna fit on Prophecy or Armageddon? Guns? Ewww.
---
Go join a small ls corp, dont join any of the blobs
---
Seems like it would be helpful to separate improved and prototype cloaks into two distinct modules.  One which hides you from directional scan (which deserves a nerf), and one which hides you visually and from overview.  
---
Having a movement penalty, even a weakened one, on the visual cloak probably makes sense.  However, I think a cloak that only removes a ship from directional scan results should have relatively little penalty at all, or at least should be an active module.
---
A better directional scanning would take into account distance and signal strength, and fail to discriminate weak signals against the background noise.  Perhaps the modules that currently affect variables relevant to the scanning system could also affect the acuity of the directional scanner in discriminating weak signals.  
---
If we wanted more directional scan options, perhaps we could trade scan time length for greater signal discrimination acuity.  Alternately, by shortening the "range" and scope of a scan, the time could be reduced.
---
I don't know if the new 64bit client touches on the scanner, but it would be nice to know if there are fewer limitations in place now.
---
Did you read the post?
---
I suspect you find most things challenging
---
Would you be willing to share your perspective?
---
You're free to be wrong.
---
I like blackout not only because of null being more dangerous, but also because it rejuvenated the ''pvp spirit'' of players
---
Meh, why don't we just make enemy ship blow up as soon as you target it, since you want to have everything easy.
---
TL;DR This is the weekly "CCP PLZ nerf cyno" post.
---
Do you mean the name or how they look?
---
Nice, using it for my desktop for a bit, I love my Loki.
---
Of course.
---
ah, thanks
---
Why dont we make the Inhibitor instant and Cyno anchoring 1 minute for next few year if you are up for a challange?
---
Snaked garmur is faster than a stabber, more news at 11.
---
Haaaalp, cyno too stronk, plz nerf!!!!!
---
Or any system that is adequately camped. People find a safer way around if pirates are too successful.
---
&gt; high/medium value- low m3 items to haul, it's probably the best choice in hisec
---
Blockade runner disagrees.
---
But anyway, my point was  that price was 100m under jita.
---
Are you saying is it not? Why?
---
Because the attacked pilot should also have a chance to react.
---
And while at it, why don't we make a "gate shutdown module" which would also shut down all stargates in a system, or something like that.
---
Tornado ganks are only an issue if you run in Jita lol
---
"Fuck there are too many boobs"
---
ofc it's pvp, the price is market driven. ppl manipulate markets to get to other players money. ever been ganked? that's also part of trading. unconsensual pvp means exactly that: no matter what you do or where you are, you are exposed to pvp.
---
I had a thought that ECM could be the opposite effect of sensor dampening, where it creates a zone around your ship where you can only be locked from outside. You then need to be kited as a brawler can't lock you. Much like you can't snipe at a Keres, you can't brawl a Griffin.
---
I don't think it should be AoE (maybe a Widow only module??) but targetted, and if you have the fleet comp can be cobined with sensor damps to prevent all lock but without the randomness of old ECM. Let its effectiveness be offset with scan strength or sensor res.
---
This then makes a nice lore based reason for Caldari and Gallente ewar where each one operates in the combat range they are least effective in.
---
Unironically I love my hunter proteus
---
Dont dump the burden of proof to me.
---
But for your info, it cannot be of any strength, as does a simple thing, allows jump drives to lock onto it, don't know else should it do.
---
So much this.
---
&gt; I understand that if you change training time for Cyno modules then alot of ppl who use cyno alts all of EVE for logistics will be mad.
---
Not really. They'd still be able to use them. The way to make it take traning longer is to add (likely science) skills as prerequisites to cyno, meaning those with Cyno would already have it and be able to use it even without those prereqs.
---
ntm super and titan pilots would pretty easily skill inject when making new ones.
---
OFC he should have a chance to react. limitation will hit both. Attacker and defencer. But atm most of the cards are in the person with Cyno fitted. Let me give you an example. If i roam in a Deimos for example. And i see another deimos on a gate. I might think this could be fun. But if the deimos intent is only to scram+web and light the cyno while activating the assault dmg ctrl so that his alt in super can kill me well that not really any chance to react for me is it? But if that ship has a 10 seconds delay on his cyno then at least i have time to try to use jam drones and pray to jesus.
---
or an active module you can 'cloak' your ship with the signiture of another ship.
---
only if you bought PLEX with the proceeds
---
&gt; the other T3Cs were buffed as covops 
---
Wait, what? Most covops hunting is done with a Loki or if you are simply lighting a covops cyno with some tackle, a prospect. The Tengu used to be a solid covops hunter, but with the nerfs, all it is really good for is PVE.  The agility and nullification nerfs mostly removed the T3C from the covops hunting game for many groups.
---
I agree, the T3Cs needed a nerf, but not to the point of near uselessness.
---
French is number 10.
---
It has the defence properties of the ship that uses it dumb dumb.
---
Don't know why you're getting downvoted other than your rhetorical opening, market discussions should be very interesting right now.
---
In Nullsec there is always a cloaky tengu watching you, even when you're in a cloaky tengu.
---
Think of it as nullsec player made Concord.
---
Also, you want to make cynojammer instant, which means attacked pilot would have no chance to activate cyno, especially with the delay you want.
---
I mean, that's what I would do.  
---
Why do people get upset about things that don't hurt them?  Does anybody get upset at a farmer for leaving a tree in his field "for nice" and no other reason?
---
So then you agree with me that all cards are on the Cyno side and not on the Inhibitor. As cyno atm is instant.
---
Please, oh please, CCP!
---
What if I also like it in combination with the other aspects of nullsec?
---
It would make sense if a weaker signal was blotted out by a stronger one, but that's probably really complicated.
---
Dude, linking your stream doesn’t make you an attention whore. If you want help though check out streamfleet. Tons of great streamers on there and you can pop into chat on most and ask questions and they’re more than willing to help. I also see your goon flair might be worth applying to INN and streaming on there. I started myself and it has really helped me gain a lot of traction.
---
goons
---
Eve is submarines in space.
---
Submarines are referred to as boats.
---
With motors.
---
Motorboat them.
---
Indeed. Sometimes they just play the lottery without taking the time to scan, or just want to watch something burn. 
---
But again, that doesn't mean fitting tank or taking other behaviours can't make you safer. Losing an empty Kryos on the undock is an outlier and bad luck for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. And painless with insurance other than a small loss of time. But losing a 1B filled T1 industrial on the Jita undock is a much more likely outcome, and not really has much luck involved given how juicy a target you have made yourself. 
---
Your fate is really in your hands. Fly safe haulers, not reckless.
---
The market already exists like a stock market.
---
Well, a commodities market.
---
Same function.
---
And your solution is to lock them to a known class of ship with a system wide beacon and spool up time, and zero resists.  Just make it a fucking clown horn, and a sign that says 'kill me please' at that point, it would be just as useful.
---
Solid reply. I give it a 5/7 on informatism.
---
Stop strawmanning.
---
They do.
---
They let you come into a new corp, steal it, set friendly fire on, and shoot everyone.
---
Don't forget the cloaky Tengu watching both of you at the same time and the other cloaky Tengu watching him
---
Nerf concord to please starved hunters next? Because all that noise sounds like r/eve only likes the game's sandbox elements when it suits them.
---
/Posted from my highsec abyssal anom alt. Still a nullsec player btw.
---
A lot of thought put i to this, a good read.
---
" This is the state of nullsec today: massing Rorquals and Supercarriers allows an alliance a massive reward in income for very little risk.   Unless you're AFK or absolutely retarded, lighting your cyno before an inhib goes up is the default behavior, and almost always, if you manage this and you're in a major null alliance, your rorqual or super will not die. " ===========================&gt;  "they've invested a lot of time and resources to build that super umbrella and that multi-account Rorq multibox setup". 
---
Organize your own corp, expand it to Alliance and invest same amount time and effort. That's is straight way to balance.
---
I agree, so mobility is more useful for a ship that can choose its starting position.
---
What the fuck?
---
welcome to Wormhole PvP!
---
Hello yes I am definitely a small easy to kill ratting cruiser, definitely not a pvp fit faction super
---
buat muahh safe afk pve?wut do with my bots army senor?
---
seriously, whatching this crybabies on forums is hilariouse...no1 told u nullsec is a safe haven for printing isk,fight for that cry shits
---
I resubbed at the start of black out, since it looked like CCP was actually doing something.   I canceled it when I realized it's more likely it's a broken clock showing the right time twice a day.
---
*  The log in incentives are a step in a stupid direction.   Basically one of those insecure K-MMO log in every day, and spend.   Even starting with skill points is more of a skin box reward "selection" thing, so that next month when they're offering skins to a ship you don't fly you'll still log in for it (since daily log ins reward value will be pegged to skill point rewards).
---
*  https://updates.eveonline.com/  is empty for the rest of the year.
---
*  Since the last time I logged in a year ago the biggest thing I've noticed are more insincere/insecure notifications for things like achievements, and spamming me 2 or 3 times a day about unspent skill points.   (do these really help players)
---
*  high sec war changes are more of a "finally", I guess.
---
The co2 post was epic.
---
I completly agree. I love Blackout and some of its effects ( reduce safety in nullsec, adressing BOTS to some lvl ) But at the end of the day we still play the same Broken mechanic game that was before Blackout. Cyno mechanics with no real counter, Ansiblex with no fatigue that allows huge alliance to keep control of 5-7 regions without much effort and reduces the potential for smaller alliance to create conflict, HAW Dreds, Fighter that behaves like recons that travel with 15k m/s, 3-4k titans in-game, etc.   
---
It's still the same broken ass game i tried to leave so many times lately. But i kinda like blackout and id like to play a bit more :)
---
The game is owned by a Korean company.
---
There isn't even a Korean language option.
---
They should just make new languages for the empires and we have to learn the language of our people to understand our HUD.
---
And the market in each system is language based on the controlling faction.
---
I agree with this 100% a delay will make it so hard to interact with your viewers. Stream snipers are always going to be an issue, but it’s better to have content than not. Also remember that more that 65% of your viewers are actually hoping to watch you die.
---
This thread adds nothing, just truisms to farm karma and appear to be knowledgeable of the game.
---
This is actually a problem in EVE atm and it seems you fail to see and find it as a fix. Migrating everyone into 2-3 pockets of super umbrellas will make the game stagnant and without fun in conflicts. Alliances should be spread around map and light in localized conflicts rather the Ansiblex you way from Paragon Soul to Detorid and back withn 10 minutes with 0 fatigue.
---
uuggg riverini jr
---
How many alts do you run there?
---
Yea you are right, let's delete cynos. Instead, any jump capable ship can just enter the name of any character, and if they're in space and within range, jump to them.
---
falcon and kitsune are support ships, theyre bad cause ecm is bad. if the new ewar's gonna be good they will be good too. navy griffin is perfectly viable for what it was used before, lowsec plex fights. u just dont fit jams anymore. try this https://i.imgur.com/nDuahiZ.png
---
Still very ineterested in EVE numbers with these CPU too.
---
I am going to buy it. Cant wait.
---
force recons ships are ther for a reason,,,look like is useless to argue with the mass of f1 monkeys
---
Yup, while it would be great for the game to support EVERY language, it doesn't make them racist for not.
---
Hell, CCP is owned by a korean company and the game has no Korean language options AND the korean text display is pretty shitty.
---
This fractal never ends
---
I have an alt character on my account with 4.5mil SP but I really don't like it's name so I'm thinking about deleting it. There is no way to transfer SP if it's below 5mil? I also assume I can't sell it since it's probably not worth much, right?
---
The basic argument he says is that the game doesn't support Spanish, therefore CCP is racist.
---
and the cloaky tengu back in your staging system watching your black ops.
---
What if ECM had an AoE effect like links, but it was the counter to links? As in, a DEBUFF (non-stacking) to point range or shield resists or speed or w/e. To keep from being OP, make the effects scripted like the links are.
---
botters get banned often.  
---
botters use alpha accounts so bans are basically meaningless.  
---
botters used VNI ratters.  
---
VNI often wont be saved by umbrella. even with perfect intel.  
---
VNI alpha nerfs just happened.
---
And how about the functionality of Cyno inhibitor atm? 0. If you are a pilot that has them on overview and react to it then there is 0 chance for me to inhib your cyno. You jump your HAW dreads and we warp off. GG. Why is EVE atm not much more the structure bash online. Why you dont see anything else roaming in Esotria except maybe 1-5 small ships that can hope they can avoid your traps.
---
Sorry I should hVe clarified, I meant for solo work, not blopa HKing
---
the test goon army gona downvote the heck out of ya...these dummies never gona change,carebear gona be a carebear interested only on safe isk
---
T3C skill loss is an antiquated mechanic that should honestly just be removed altogether. Nothing else in the game works like it any more, and T3Cs aren't the must-have nigh-unstoppable ships they used to be.
---
It was something good, that's for sure.
---
That's addressed later in the post. Realistically those who already have titans/supers have a far easier time expanding to large numbers of titans/supers because they're the ones who can defend their miners and ratters.
---
No logical krab would join a startup with 3 rorqs and 3 supercaps when they can join an established umbrella. Just saying "grow" assumes there's some kind of reason for people with those assets to join anyone not in the major nullblocs to krab.
---
ECM is one of those things that scales weirdly between small gangs and large gangs.
---
Frankly, it might as well just work more like sensor dampeners.  If you have 10 gravimetric strength, and you get knocked down to just 1, there should be some change in an exponent that modifies the range and speed with which you can lock a gravimetric signature.  
---
That way, you don't do nothing, but you instead simply do less, and moving yourself on the battlefield might make a difference.  Similarly, there is significantly less reliance upon random number generation.
---
This would require some retooling for basic ship stats.  Instead of having just one stack of signal strength, they would need a distribution across all of them.  E.g. a basilisk might have higher grav sensor stats, while a thrasher would probably have high radar and magneto sensor strength.  
---
Confusingly, your lock range and speed would probably be presented as the average of all of them, unless there was a more detailed breakdown.
---
One net effect is that it would put simplistic fleet metas off kilter.
---
Two slight corrections. 
---
1) ccp is a neutral douche, Seriously, I’ve been to several eve events (Vegas, etc) and can say that yes, most ccp ppl are douches.
---
2) ns rorq mining, while very high up on the isk/hr is not the best. C5-c6 sites are the best.
---
Other then those, you raise a lot of good, well thought out points
---
Where can i find a place like that?
---
ofc they are because this is their play style. Undock - jump - Boson. But if we dont speak out about the issues we face in game as a player then we can all stop playing now.
---
Don't act dumb you know what I mean.
---
Well it becomes a tradeoff of advantage vs extreme advantage.
---
Fart harder?
---
brb im in war thunder
---
Except you want cyno inhibs to be instant.  And anyway, if I'm not in the one ship class that can light a cyno, or have one instantly on grid, I wouldn't be able to light a cyno anyway under your retarded ass system.
---
Why do I even bother engaging a dumbass like you...
---
abyssal are instances. any ship in an instance is one less ship in the real game.
---
As soon as they announced Blackout on TQ i knew this will becoume even more a problem. As players will migrate more and more as they die into safer alliances.
---
&gt; How does the mass of an oversized ab affect your ship
---
\shits on your agility but it's still more useful than mwd for damage mitigation  
---
&gt; what is the difference in speed?  
---
75-80% of an unscrammed mwd, may take a few cycles to get there though
---
I'm normally in highsec boonies, seeing anyone out here is strange
---
would be interesting to see a gun thats double or quad barrel take more than one crystal, but it would break balance a bit
---
this is a pretty good showcase of people just parroting what they heard and not knowing what they're talking about, nor reading the comment replied to.
---
combat recons don't warp cloaked 
---
T3s with covert/force recons still have a 5s targeting delay before they can start locking the target, so effectively the same as deceleration(a bit more even?)
---
bombers were covered already in the replied to comment
---
Nullsec is not and shouldn’t feel safe. You want safe pve, lowsec still has local.
---
I run L5 in a buffer gila. It's 100mn ab but still...
---
I actually suggested the idea both cyno and inhib have a 10 sec spool time. I only suggested Inhib to be instant as an idea to better understand the effects of instant Cyno. But a fair and similar spool up time for both its what i suggested.
---
Spaniards are the most retarded race in gaming with pinoys.
---
Found that hunter that could not kill a few targets and is blaming cynos now.
---
Cyno have only one problem: it should not take 10 fuckin minutes.
---
Everything else, is just tears, sweet tears.
---
CCPlease: make a module that once i lock the enemy, it will instantly dies.
---
If CCP was onboard they could switch it up enough to prevent it from becoming an established rock-paper-scissor. They could technically already do this in the current Abyssal Traces - but they don't. 
---
Add bonus to things like neuts, or repair times. Increase boundary size, decrease boundary size. Bonus to speed ... etc etc etc. There could also be penalties. 
---
The reason it appeals to me - and its just an idea. Is that as I get older (irl) my ability to play has become less and less. Gone are the days that I could play EVE for a long stretch multiple times a week. I remember when my group roamed every night and if we got a really good fight once or twice a week we were happy. Now using some of my very cherished computer time to do a roam or timer that doesn't result in a fight - seems less than appealing. 
---
Now there is so many 'timers' and discord pings. Your side shows up but the other side doesn't (uncontested citadel bashing) then the next timer the other side shows up +300% (so its an uncontested repair timer). 
---
Not to mention you and your friends on a roam in NULL getting trapped down a dead end pipe with recon webs and carriers and HAW dreads and bubbles after a 1 hour roam in your battlecruiser. Mmm safe logging for an extraction tomorrow - thats fun. 
---
With the current set up, when big fights do break out they're amazing and highly anticipated, but all of this wouldn't be impacted by the arena/zone idea. The PVE side of eve wouldn't be impacted either. For the people that wanted to play this gamestyle it would be part of the sandbox, and wouldn't affect anyone in a negative impact that I can see.
---
I like how most people complain how stupid the idea of " Instant Inhibitor " is and they don't realize that we have been under Instant Cyno for 16 years lol.
---
Naw, the better idea is to remove asset safety from nullsec .
---
Make a post on eve forum presenting you and what you want and more importantly what you don’t want. 
---
Perhaps your time zone is precise or you cannot be on time in operation due to irl . 
---
For me , I don’t use discord or any voiceapp . So it’s my first question.
---
Discuss with the operator and if you feel good apply. Don’t forget is very simple to quit a Corp so try different ones
---
A type of Corp can at one time be perfect for you and some months later be not suited . 
---
The most important thing is : it’s not you that is seeking a Corp , it’s the corps that try to have you.

Seriously? I was just going to start running them again... wtf ccp.
---
&gt;The stale state of null is a direct consequence of capital/supercapital ships and cynos. The lack of mercenary or pirate gameplay is a direct consequence of capital/supercapital ships and cynos. The absolute gulf between Imperium/Legacy/PanFam and the rest of the game is a direct consequence of capital/supercapital ships and cynos.  
---
&gt;Until CCP addresses the core mechanics which have made this state of play inevitable and continue to widen the gap by the day, Eve will continue to hemorrhage not only players but entire alliances like Skill Urself who realize there's just no way to bridge the gap.  
---
&gt;Get people out and about in subcap ships for PvE, home defense, and aggression again and Eve will benefit for it.
---
Ummm, yes? I think everyone, even CCP realizes the issues with the version of Supercapitals Online that Eve has become. In a balanced game, all ships would have a role and not be dominated by the top one or two ship classes in the game. That actually works reasonably well for the subcaps - most ship classes at least have a place - but not so much for the capitals and especially supercapitals which are pretty much an apex force without counter. 
---
These ships are oppressive. Dropping them, almost without exception, is an "I Win" button that only can be countered by the other side bringing more of them. They also are also costly, meaning groups won't risk them unless they are sure of success which breeds risk aversion. They are broken, but yet they serve as a major driver of player activity because they are so broken. 
---
I don't blame CCP for having a tough time cracking this tough nut. But yeah, the power gap between sub-capitals and capitals is significant, and large bar for new entrants. Finding a way to fix that would be good. Until then, he who has grinded for the largest supercap fleet has won, barring some internal rot or quitting due to boredom. 
---
Diagnosing the issue isn't hard, but fixing it is. Maybe CCP has recently found the *cojones* and resources to do something about this. Or perhaps not.
---
Yes, I read it. More coward cloaks online. Does that trigger you? I hope it does.
---
I don't use cloaks, I use a T1 frigate. I still manage to roam and get kills. Yes, it's challenging. You hide behind a cloak to get easy kills as a high skill point player. I think that is cowardly. Does that trigger half of Reddit? I hope it does.
---
I know what you mean "I'm risk averse and want my content free and not worked for"
---
you obviously are slow. I only ask for a change of equal abilities in combat. I only ask that people who play the game in small numbers and not that affected by idiots who jump titans on their 3 man frig roam and think its great gameplay. I only ask for a more balanced way to counter Cyno realistically in Capitals Online. My main char has 66 loses under Cyno inhibitor section. So i undock, play and create content. ATM CYNO is overpowered like fuck and 99% of the time the response against a 10 man gang is 4 times more pilots in Capiotals. GG Great Game. Idiot
---
Dude relax, at least you have not retardet Translations like 'Warpunterbrechungszerstörer' in the german Client, or the russian Client has more worst Examples. Git gut and learn some english. Eve Client in your Mother Language is for the lazy People.
---
Wormhole space is not defined solely by lack of instant local chat. It is best defined by the constantly changing connections to other systems via Wormholes. This creates unpredictability in connections, but predictability in the maximum scale of the possible fight. No wormhole space fight can turn into the next Asakai. I think wormholers like that and I would not like to see that change.
---
Nullsec now has the same predictable (gates and jump bridges) and unpredictable (wormholes and jump drives) connections to other systems as it had before, but the potential for a fight to escalate wildly has been greatly enhanced by Blackout.
---
I love the unpredictability and uncertainty of knowing that at any moment a simple fight could escalate beyond all control. I love the premium this will place on active spies and scouts.
---
I want Eve to have a wider variety of accessibility, predictability, risk. I would like to see more variety across all of Eve. The differences in space should not be linear. Some systems have advantages and disadvantages due to security status, proximity to other kinds of space, ease of finding other pilots or being found by them. I’d like to see alliances choosing between space by weighing lots of factors. I’d like to see geography matter even more than it does now.
---
I want CCP to encourage pilots to be active and out in space. 
---
I want a sovereign Nullsec environment that rewards the most organized, best equipped, and most daring pilots. Not an environment that caters to keeping the lowest common denominator safe, that rewards the most craven and most risk averse. 
---
But I don’t want a sovereign Nullsec environment where you need to own Supercapitals in order to take and hold space, but you need to take and hold space to own Supercapitals. I’d love to remove all Supercapitals from Eve.
---
I want tools that allow and encourage unpredictable interactions, not binary “fight or flight” decisions where the best choice is usually “flight.”
---
This turned into a rambling response, but I’ll leave it.
---
Straight up evil. Can't wait.
---
Fuck off

---
Everybody here is just being a whiny little bitch because they feel like getting jammed remove the ability to fight and makes it some sort of auntie content thing. Bro your ship is still blowing up and we're getting all the content in the world. I can't believe people wouldn't make the same argument over weapon destruction and damps. like, you can only hit 500 m in front of you and Target out to 5K but it's cool you aren't getting jammed so it's clearly a good mechanic.
---
Half of the instances people used your I have almost never seen. I exclusively flew a blackbird on fleets back in the day and was constantly either Alphad off the field or I successfully warped range and instead of had fast tackle chasing me around giving me a good sense of a decent fight. People act like there are actual fleet comps with 50 rooks involved jamming out the entire enemy fleet.
---
Thanks for clarifying, I was confused for a moment!
---
More wiggle room for when the 100mn cruiser tries to keep flying outside your control range.
---
Let jump freighters jump without a cyno so they don't have to subscribe an extra account just for that \o/
---
reminds me of [this](http://i.imgur.com/vGVlbOv.jpg)
---
Imagine having enough speed or another mid to dual web. Also what point is wiggle room if you can't shoot it because your blasters don't hit that far?
---
Horde has no auth, also very slow to react on scammers.
---
Watch when CCP nerfs Loki by nerfing medium autocannons, just like they nerfed medium railguns during petes online.
---
stabber and machariel are both excellent bumping ships
---
Another one of these but a good post just bat capitals into the ground then nerf anoms to where you have to spread out to make good consistent isk
---
Everything I can do in a Proteus that is bling fit I can do in any other T3 with a T2 fitting. The Proteus is outclassed by every other T3 in regards to DPS, Tank, and utility.
---
yes.
---
That's why I switched to ISK/effort as a metric. C5/6 sites are great ISK but you rinse them fast and then the ISK is gone. You also cant cyno in supers to defend your C5 dreads.
---
Said it a million times so one more cant hurt.
---
Make it reduce drone bandwidth. Limiting the number of drones an enemy target can control while jammed.
---
I think removing asset recovery from nullsec will fix most problems.
---
Your in goons and you couldn't get enough people to drop/ flight on a single dread??
---
If the people that live in your wh constellation are good, the sites respawn at a decent pace for daily runs. Granted it isn’t fast enough for 24/7 but still plenty for one/two people
---
Cállate su boca.
---
Spanish is spoken by a little over 500 million people. English? Just shy of a Billion.
---
Also remember, a large portion of Spanish speaking countries do not have reliable internet connections, especially those in South America. Their cities have it, but only for the rich.  That greatly lowers the numbers of potential players that speak Spanish.
---
It is useful if you configure it.
---
Does nothing problematic. Other people enjoy it, some people like myself even find it useful. But no, a couple people don't think there should be anything in the game they dont use, so better remove it!
---
I got killed a lot.
---
Show me where a non shit tier wormhole group uses them as a regular fixture in their fleets. 
---
Parking a Falcon 100km of some schmuck you ganked running sites that you didn't really need anyway doesn't count.
---
People who don't configure features of their game, and then get upset about seeing information that they didn't bother to customize: /u/brygphilomena
---
If the spool up matches then they may as well be instant as the first to activate on a tick wins. Make it so a certain ship can use, the capital pilot will have one ready off grid to warp in at whatever range the inhib is set for. It's a circle jerk you will always loose as the hunter.
---
In the end good fits will live, shit fits will die. As it is now.
---
RIP Eve
---
Yeah I get them spoopy Anoikis feels in K-space now. Bob be praised.
---
GNI is not bad. Actually it’s p decent solo boat.
---
Just, you must fit ECM burst instead of standard ECM.
---
It’s not stable and cancerous as pre-nerf GNI, but if you fit some tank with Burst Jammer, it’s fun as fuck.
---
I think most of the replies here are from people who don’t play eve DD.

I’m like the idea of blackout. If it is equal for all, it is advantage to none.

Way to miss the point of the post

Me too! I get killed a lot! We can repawn, who cares besides risk adverse cowards? Oh, don't fly what you can't afford to lose.
---
Heh hunters looking for easy prey... Without any defense , so they can fap all night how great they are... 
---
Enjoy the no local you have now...
---
But do not cry when hunted ppl are bringing help to not make it so easy for you...
---
It is so fun for you hunters to kill defenceless ships right? But God forbids that the prey tries to fight back...
---
Hang on while I drop any amount of capitals on your subcap force and defeat it.
---
Wowzers if anyone sounds trigger it’s the dude with the name tiredofcowards. How dare people play this sandbox game different from the way you play.
---
That's a real long way of saying unchecked player activities have ruined the game.
---
Totally. Hilarious and broken.
---
Elite PvP at its finest. It takes 5 Billion in ship hardware to kill a 100 Mil non-combat salvage ship. Just the absolute finest example of hardcore PvP I have ever seen in any game, anywhere. Congratulations to all involved! &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
---
Just because the game doesn't provide a Spanish version, it's racist? Hope you're kidding there as that's not logical at all.
---
You misunderstand the point of my post. Nullsec alliances can and should have to form escort fleets to move their logistics ships around to fuel their citadels. The fact everyone in an alliance just jumps through ansiplex jump gates no matter the ship they fly makes less people to interact with. If I was in a massive alliance I’d want other alliances to use standard gates so I could organise raids in their regions. Fights would occur and content would be created. As it stands people live in their regions and do their thing in a ‘safe’ way because they have the option to. To think that people would evacuate to high sec or low sec is laughable. Some would but alliances would still carry on as usual.
---
&gt; Points to all the rorqual losses
---
Don't broadcast you don't know how the game works pal.
---
That is the definition of a carebear, yes
---
For solo in a cruiser? Yes. Because frigate sites pay out 3 times as much as cruiser sites. 
---
But can be done reliably with a much smaller investment.
---
bye
---
Remove multiboxing.
---
good job not offering any counter point at all, because you have none. If you are in a null corp without an intel network, you are bad, if you are in a null corp with an intel network and still get tackled (pre blackout) you are mentally handicapped or asleep.
---
Yeah, I guess I'm looking at this on the scale of a corp/alliance rather than an individual.
---
Those VNIs need to come from somewhere.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Thing about streaming is that you're giving up some so you can share it with others. It's like that with every multiplayer game. Although in eve it's more prominent.
---
Very much this. I have seen more possible targets - including a lot of bait targets - out in Tenal and Branch than I ever thought possible. A sizable percentage of people are whining about the changes, but many others are learning to play more cooperatively and work together to overcome the new challenges. And that's what Eve is all about.
---
Not really, just encourages the krabs even more into the biggest groups.
---
So reducing the cyno activation with 10 seconds and give same attributes to inhibitor will render you defenseless?  So thinking like that i cant imagine you can imagine how it is now for small groups who struggle in low sec under Snuff control, or any small roam fleet that goes anywere in control of big blocs.
---
So what you are saying is. Restrict Cynos from Capitals and Super Capitals?
---
I like it.
---
That’s good, but then the big groups will start clearing out citadels.
---
I tried to point out the issue with cynos on the TIS Discord but got jumped on by an obnoxious WH player who started going off about a sub cap I never lost when I used a VNI as an example and other such deflections.   
---
I was putting up the issue with cynos and super/titan proliferation and was suggesting that perhaps having a random jump in point on grid would make the game more interesting and with some other players was to the point of suggesting that the structure cyno beacons would be fully accurate to 0, and that there would be different level of cynos, which would allow greater mass to jump through before lock on the exact location was lost and stuff dropped all over the grid.   
---
Some people liked the idea of small battles across the grid but so many just seem to be brain dead about even putting up ideas without being insulting twits.   The WH idiot managed to derail it and stop people from putting forth ideas and I almost got muted on the server for calling him a Wormholer who has no idea about cynos.
---
So respect to you for putting up this post, more people need to understand this.
---
There's no dick that progod won't preemptively suck.
---
To my surprise I've really enjoyed the blackout.  Last weekend I was camping with corp mates using VNI's as bait.  Dank kill mails and good times over comms.  I've left it a bit longer for mining but today I undocked my Rorqual for the first time since the blackout began.  Safety in numbers and all that so a few of us grouped up together.  Again chat in comms and a much better time than sitting along in an anom.  The greater risk is generally being made up for by fun.
---
Where I feel it has made a bigger difference unfortunately is the newer and lower skilled pilots out in null.  Sub-cap money making seems disproportionally negatively impacted by the change.  I'm meaning the people who can just about fly a VNI or barge.  I think there's a lot having a rough time of it.
---
It does make me (at at least) yearn for the old days of eve, when seeing a Titan was a rare thing. I sometimes wish I could go back. Before injectors and excavator drones. When people would have to commit months(even years) to flying a Titan. Now you get some moron with a credit card, 2-3 months later he is losing a Titan every couple weeks.
---
And don’t forget about the dummy who skilled the wrong ship, in a cloak Legion, watching them. 
---
I’m that dummy.

---
L4s are pretty bad compared to carrier ratting as a time/isk activity.  Drops are shit too.  With a little LP crash it will make navy ships a bit cheaper too.  I see nothing bad about this.  It will make war decs great for smaller groups again.
---
Basically it looks like crap, it's slow and it can't do any of of the things it should be able to do properly. 
---
Oh I thought you said POTUS. Never mind.
---
You keep saying by definition, but its a definition you yourself are defining.  Citadels break your definition, NPC stations break your definition, docking does too, logging out as well.  You are basically arguing that your definition is right and other people's are wrong, and I'm saying its open to interpretation, and in the end the only interpretation that is correct is the one CCP creates and gives us.  
---
You seem to lack imagination of what kind of systems could be implemented.  Many games have a standard mode of play in addition to a brawl mode, of rotating different game modes, think HotS, Overwatch, etc.   As I've posted in another thread it could easily be integrated into Eve Lore via a simulation, where players have to pony up the ship hull as an entry fee for simulation time.  People would gladly sacrifice a ship to pay for simulation CPU time just to play Eve and have fun.  
---
PS idgaf who you are, I guess you got butthurt because I said you shit and pissed in your sandbox enough.  But if you enjoy the current situation, you are most likely one of the cancerous tumors that defecates where he eats.
---
That's one option, but then they'll just cloak another cyno ship on grid. Realistically give cynos a spool up, make the cyno inhib immediately prevent jumping when it becomes online, and nerf super capital and Rorqual income by a massive factor.
---
Cost is not a good enough balancing factor for caps any more.
---
I'm not in Goons. And the Dreadnought was in Tenal. Eventually I'll be in a position to drop enough on him on short notice two hours after DT, but this morning I wasn't ready.
---
Lets see here...
---
So the cyno, not the capital ships, are the problem here. 
---
**If I was CCP, what would I do?** 
---
Judging by how they handled the whole issue with delaying local to give hunters an even better chance, the only result would be: Remove Cynos, then reintroduce them via structures *oh wait we already have that*
---
Goddamn I love being docked.
---
This is so retarded, it has to be a meme post. Even goons aren't this dumb.
---
Doesnt matter, my penis is already smaller than before
---
goddamn goons and their army of 400 strippers
---
&gt; The ability to warp while cloaked would make them push T3C hunters out and mean they don't need any support.
---
that amazing 3b, 10s align, 2 au warp speed hunter(with worse acceleration i might add) that can't mjd out of bait in the first 30s, can barely tank one carrier, is gonna get memed in a single volley by a super. You always will need support, unless you're hunting domis or some smt you ain't killing shit with a single blops bs.
---
I think a better approach is buffing cyno inhibation rather than nerfing cynoes themselves.
---

---
I never understood the entitlement of people who somehow think its perfectly fine to be able to sit in a indestructible station and when they like take out a small group of cruisers that together cost less then half of a mining drone of a rorq  and still expect to kill the actual rorq as well, if not they complain. 
---
This is where there is no risk/reward. If you in your cruiser cant kill 1 mining drone for every 10 ships you loosing you should go back to frigates
---
There's various possibilities but I think a lot are situational.  For example an ECMed ship could have longer lock times - an issue for fleets when trying to swap as primaries change but not an issue for a small gang where everyone can be pre-locked.  The problem is finding something that's valid in most scenarios in the same way other e-war types are for other races.
---
For the GNI I agree, start again from scratch and do something different.
---
Multiboxing isn't the problem and would kill the smallgang blackops game

People troll The Intiative’s member pride and egos by saying all The Imperiums member alliances are in goons, to create friction between them and Goonswarm. 
---
Its a low effort troll.
---
^So much this.  Any combination of these changes would be great.
---
Those newer and lower skilled pilots need to work with and be protected by older and higher skilled (in SP and real skills) pilots. This is a good change.
---
My corporation has also been doing bait PVE/PVP ops and enjoying them. 
---
Not a wormholer, but by the way... every single one of our ships has a cyno fitted and 300 dudes sitting on a Titan waiting to drop at all times. Along with no less than 12 Black Legion spies. And a Falcon.
---
Congratulation on reading the first paragraph.
---
This is a common role newbies play in tandem with high sp players in my experience. I used to noctis for tengu ratters when i was a newbee.
---
Not to me, I don't do market PVP or any of that. I just like seeing the ticker scroll past.

I think I'll downvote.

---
Alright, the correct, true, non-troll  term is Goons' Pet.
---
Yes
---
Unfortunately not. Besides every fleet constantly having times every time they move anywhere, because you'll collide hundreds of times per minute when anchoring, the server load of tracking every bump backwards in time for some number of minutes would be massive.
---
3.50
---
It's time to stop havish lmao
---
&gt; &gt; &gt; why put a T3 on grid that can be alphad when you can use a brick tanked Sin to neut and tackle at the same time as drop?
---
&gt; &gt; A ratting carrier will likely kill most blops with their fighters...
---
&gt; Not if you get about 3 logi legions with armor/info links on grid.
---
you just dropped ~6b on a hostile grid to *maybe* kill 2.5-3.5b before insurance, and that's assuming a single blops will be able to sit there for long enough to kill the carrier (it won't). I really don't think a hk t3c would get volleyed by a single carrier either, but been a while since i actually checked  their ehp values
---
Thanks for the downvote, my guy, hope you get some powder for that chapped butthole.

No. You should unsub

I'm not terribly mad. Nullsec has become what I was originally told it was. Dangerous. Unpredictable. Mysterious.

Sitting in my Rorqual mining yesterday I had a Wolf sit about 60km off me that was red. He didn't bug me, I didn't bug him. Eventually he left after like 45 seconds. Was kind of interesting.

Maybe he was sending Intel and nobody wanted to bite...maybe he was just seeing if I was AFK. Who knows. I was nervous for about 3 seconds until I just kept doing my thing.

No multi boxing skill injector become a whole entire thing, no multiboxing means no more +1 infinite scaleability for rorqs. No multiboxing means no more infinite faxes thus severely limiting the longevity of super fleets. No multiboxing means PI is an actuall  way of earning isk thus being a passive income source for lowsec pirates. Also for a lot of newer players multi boxing means additional subscription fees as nowadays not having at least 1 additional alt puts you way behind in comparison.
---
It has nothing to do with risk adversity. Which is what those fucking freighters were doing. 
---
The ability to mobilize 8 freighters with no QRF or escort is the epitome of risk adversity. Nobody should be able to get away with that shit.
---
Ccp made a mistake by saying the out was temporary. If they left it unknown, krabs would have to adapt, not just wait until its over
---
As someone who runs DED sites in a tengu, yes please buff the kinetic damage.  1100 with rage is nice but 1200 would be alot cooler.
---
Except with stable connections and limitless backup, it's awesome!
---
have you put a ring on her yet?
---
no you're just a pussy who wants easy mode for shooting people and no risk for yourself.
---
I uncloaked on a VNI a couple days ago as 4 Lokis also uncloaked at the same time. They wound up killing both of us. I actually laughed out loud because the timing was so perfect that I couldn’t believe it was actually happening.
---
So, back when Eve was first advertised in the UK, back around 2002. I always thought it was an 'always online' game of nomads. Sure, i'd just come from playing games like freelancer. But i figured it was 'always' risky to exist.
---
This is the first change that makes me feel nostalgic for that memory.
---
That's just natural and you see it in any game that doesn't have some sort of matchmaking mechanic.  It's the whole reason people theory craft or use different compositions. It's all about trying to get an advantage over your opponent. Superior numbers is the easiest way to do that.
---
Or perhaps I want some SLIGHT level of pseudo realism.
---
That should be a thing, but in the form of a totally different module. That’d be hilarious.
---
Yep, Most corps view membership in these big newbro corps such as Horde as an immediate red flag. Anyone who has been in these newbro corps is automatically rejected or viewed with extreme suspicion.
---
Kf recruiters have a massive stick up their ass. Just join ascee
---
Oh is it that time already for the Weekly Cyno Change Suggestion Post™?
---
Some people just take their video games way too seriously
---
You are laughably wrong.  The less safe space is, the less people will want to live there. Unfortunately, the majority of the playerbase is not here for PvP. That portion of the game does not interest them. That is why a corp with over 10k members can only fill 1 fleet. Because most of their members are hurr durr'ing while hiding in a citadel whenever someone flies through.
---
PVE will shift to the safest activity possible in game. Shock!
---
I get that maybe you wanted to take out your shiny new toy, but that was stupid as fuck. You could have probably killed the Noctis with your hunter. Risking a multi-billion ISK ship to drop on a Noctis isn't very smart. You're lucky the other person was more inept than you were

It’s not so much anything about being labeled a spi but some null alliances / corps are laid back, some are some what 75% stuck up there own arse and paranoid a spi will rip the alliance apart and the remaining few are so stuck up there own arse there head are poking through the other side. As for multi accounts that’s the only way if you want a pvp / Indy toon so there loss. Plus there is so much better out there then karmafleet.
---
Think thats the point... they want you to run invasions
---
Literally all of your comments are complaining on r/eve about recent changes.
---
I have a feeling RL isn't your strong suit which may be why you're crying so much about these video game updates.
---
I actually upvoted you.
---
Correct.
---
When a wh is actively rolled into your system. Do you really think that it is possible to form a 50 man subcap defence fleet in time to make a difference?
---
You are kinda retarded -.-
---
Damn I just got into abyssals, lame :/
---
I get it but even 1v1 is pretty punishing unless you have billions of isk to blow
---
A subreddit dedicated to a video game is probably not the best place to ask, tbh.
---
Mommies credit card presumably.
---
Eve is just a slow drop by design. It’s cool just wish they had some mechanics to acually have a winner to things
---
Come to think of it, has anyone kept track of the Jita price of Exotic Dancers, Female since this whole high sec embargo thing started?
---
That there was no Muninn in they fight
---
Appreciated. The reason it is a low effort troll is that The Initiative is one of the imperiums strongest, most competent, and most independent member alliances. The troll is poking at people’s impulse to correct them.
---
It’s challenging, but it’s not scary. There’s nothing at stake when you fly a T1 frigate. There’s a lot at stake when you’re flying a 2 bil cruiser that can’t disengage easily if you get caught. People don’t actively try to bait Merlins to drop supers on them. Cloaky shit is scary because you don’t know when the Noctis you just uncloaked on is a hull tanked cyno fit. People are always trying to bait out cloaky ships, and they’re doing it now more than ever. It makes it exciting, it makes it dangerous, and in a lot of cases, it leads to some really awesome fights. You can shit on it all you want, but coming from somebody that roams everything from frigates to T3C’s, you don’t know what you’re talking about.
---
Man, it's almost as if CCP added NPCs that can insta-delete anything subcap if they happen to spawn on you, then delete local so ratter can't see danger coming. You expect people to stick around when faced with overwhelming risk factor? They're going to upship to something substantial enough to survive, not play in that area of space, or just not play at all.
---
Who'd have seen this coming?!?!? SHOCK
---
And that’s completely irrelevant to the point he’s making.
---
I’m sorry roaming into the most heavily player defended sectors of space isn’t easier for you :( 
---
Truly I am.  Fingers crossed ccp fucks over tens of thousands of players so you can easily and safely kill other people without them killing you back :(
---
It gave us hope!
---
Hordes amazing, you only get out what you put in. No corp is gonna log your account in and play the game for you...
---
"Oh hey a ratting carrier."
---
Warp in on a (insert heavy tackle that is nearly impossible to kill solo)
---
Being rejected from KF isn't a big deal, lol. Apply to one of the other 600 corps in Goonswarm (start with Ascendance).
---
fwiw, if you're not a wretched PITA on comms you can find a nice spot in most corps. If you're also nice and solid at some niche(s) and/or willing to learn, you'll get into most of those corps you couldn't get into just by being tolerable (the being nice part is less and less important the more compelling your personality is and/or competent you are). Those corps remaining are either not worth your time or are good targets for infiltration, depending on your point of view.
---
I'm feeling pretty guilty about also talking my friend into joining with me. He just wanted to mine his rocks in high-sec.
---
*Broadsword appears on overview* “oh.”
---
Just be me: and have All Strategic cruisers and just spend your life retraining subsystems
---
The good olepermajam days will be back bois
---
I love all these poors crying because their betters have Capitals.
---
This nosy gamer blog post deserves bit more recognition for putting some work in to show direct comparison of dotlan maps before and after blackout.
---
You mean zero?
---
Whilst true, it is both a terrible way to impart information and forgetting the 'because I want to use this mechanic' factor that is a huge part of the enjoyment in any decent game.
---
Caring more about min maxing the risk/reward of  kb stats is kind of a reason why the black out was needed in the first place. Let people have their fun.
---
If it is an hk tengu then (if it has any at all) there will be barely any dps. Better yo just nuke it with a sin.
---
So you are upset with one newbie Corp and immediately look to join another newbie Corp that hates your first Corp.
---
It's less about the autopilot and more about the "I literally can't see anything in overview or in space but hey lemme just do this anyways wcgw" but honestly, unless they've minimized chat or literally never used the autopilot once in that entire week... yes
---
Why you using 5 heavies on an Ishtar instead of a Gecko squad
---
Hmm, I see capitals dying to subcaps all over ZKill. Are you saying squizz coded his site wrong?
---
Nothing at stake for you with a T1. I mine up the minerals  to buy that T1, as I have no isk. I simply have the means to get more, as do you. The risk is equal my T1 and your T3. What may not be equal is the aversion to risk.
---
If coward doesn't apply to you why take offense at generalities. Unless your conscience is bothering you.
---
Where they far enough away from you that you can be sure you didn't uncloak them? Its coll either way, I just want to know what I should be happily imagining
---
&gt; I guess you got butthurt because I said you shit and pissed in your sandbox enough. But if you enjoy the current situation, you are most likely one of the cancerous tumors that defecates where he eats.
---
Toxic little fucker aren't you?  
---
Had you considered I'm not enjoying the current situation, and in fact haven't been subbed for the past couple of years? And prior to that have lived in w-space and was in a tourne team that made it to a 5/5 final?
---
Find anyone that understands "a sandbox pvp game" to mean anything other than 'people can build castles out of sand and/or kick other castles over'.
---
Have you ever put in the months of training for a tourne team? Or played Eve under the mechanics of a long term honourable war, such as RvB?
---
&gt;Citadels break your definition, NPC stations break your definition, docking does too, logging out as well.
---
Citadels/asset safety indeed seems retarded, I spend the first years of w-space living out of a POS, always were my assets at risk, no docking, I could log off 1 ship per char but that'd still be returning to where a POS should be, and instead a "rapecaged" trap could be (do you even remember POS, &gt;1week anchored bubble rapecages, etc?).
---
I always rejected the nullsec mechanics, when it was POS driven, TCUs, entosis, whatever it is now. CCP hasn't found a good anti-blob/negative feedback solution.
---
But that doesn't mean instanced PVP is suddenly a good idea, it'd be a distraction from solving this bigger challenge that could instead involve the majority of the playerbase.
---
"The VNIs and myrms all left :("
---
"Nerf Capitals please else the game ruined :("
---
"Fuck Gilas in hisec btw :("
---
Most importantly you don't have to scan down gates
---
I agree. Level the playing field. Remove Supercapitals completely. Or, if they must stay... add the siege module to them and nerf them to “regular capitals +5-10%” while keeping the build costs the same.
---
Who is crying? Are you crying and doing a bit of transference? If the word coward doesn't apply to you why care? Maybe time to be introspective.
---
I didn't accuse you of being a spy you stupid fuck. I asked you if a character was your alt. I ask THOUSANDS of people this same question, as it's a basic question.
---
You made it easy for me by turning into a massive crybaby idiot when I asked you a simple and VERY basic question.
---
Also, our wait is currently 3-4 days until you application is looked at.
---
Yeah, it always blows my mind when I see people recommend these huge null groups to people new to the game.  Safety != simplicity.  Null is very safe if you know what you're doing.  However, just navigating the UI can be overwhelming for newer players.  I don't care if the community views FW groups as generally shit or a stepping stone or sub-prime content, I think most of us agree that these groups served an important (and now vacant) role in easing newbies into pvp.
---
Like NC? Reee
---
All of that is pretty much correct. 
---
Even in your worst-case scenario (the hunter has started locking you and you are still at 0 velocity), you still don't automatically die (even though you are very likely to against a competent hunter). Cruisers will take a few seconds to lock you, and you can use that time to overheat your MWD and burn as far away as possible from him. With some luck, you'll get over 10km away, at which point they can't scram you. Warp scramblers are modules that prevent you from warping, but also prevent you from using an MWD, which means you're dead, however they have a short ~10km range. If you just get warp *disrupted*, it means you can still zoom around with your MWD, and you're most likely faster than a cruiser, so you can probably get out of their range and warp out. 
---
If they do manage to scram you, your last option is to use ECM drones (look up Hornet EC-300) - these have a chance to break their lock for 5 seconds, giving you a window of opportunity to escape, however they are very unreliable. 
---
Finally, there is a module called 'warp core stabilizer', which protects you from *some* forms of warp disruption.
---
Unti CCP improves UI and the search starts again.
---
Not yet but I'm planning to
---
I wish someone at CCP could see your post
---
He is a newbie so yes thats what they do....
---
Im not having fun here let me try the other new player friendly corp.
---
﻿[ 2019.07.20 17:27:47 ] Toni Delancor &gt; Artunius you didn't add all your characters.
---
﻿[ 2019.07.20 17:27:59 ] Artunius &gt; I added all of them to the site
---
﻿[ 2019.07.20 17:28:08 ] Toni Delancor &gt; even Alta Burgs?

﻿[ 2019.07.20 17:28:17 ] Artunius &gt; That's my friends character.
---
﻿[ 2019.07.20 17:29:57 ] Artunius &gt; I think I'll just talk to Reen about joining another GSF corp. I don't like being accused of having characters that I don't have.
---
﻿[ 2019.07.20 17:30:11 ] Toni Delancor &gt; That's fine, it's up to you

﻿[ 2019.07.20 17:30:19 ] Toni Delancor &gt; I ask people about characters I think are alts a lot

﻿[ 2019.07.20 17:30:29 ] Toni Delancor &gt; if you're that sensitive, goonswarm is likely not a good fit for you
---
﻿[ 2019.07.20 17:32:34 ] Artunius &gt; Thanks for being a massive cunt, Toni.
---
﻿[ 2019.07.20 17:32:42 ] Toni Delancor &gt; No problem
---
That's really weird.
---
I have been all over the place, CFC, Horde, Brave, even awoxing and corporate theft.
---
Still haven't had much issue getting into serious corporations.
---
X47 they were outnumber at the armor timer, just had more titans
---
Don't forget it can also fit a ton of neuts in the highs. PvP noctis is real.
---
KarmaFleet doesn't care if you were in PH. Not at all.
---
You were never accused of being a spy.
---
You were never told why you were rejected, but it was probably because you won't declare all of your alts based on your original post.
---
And I will repeat this so the folks in the back can hear. 
---
KARMAFLEET DOES NOT HOLD NEWBIE CORPS AGAINST YOU.
---
I pay for my ships with plex, typically, but that’s neither here nor there. I’m not bothered by you calling people cowards. I’m bothered by the fact that you pretend to know what you’re talking about when you’ve clearly never flown a T3C because, if you had, you’d understand that every time you uncloak is a risk. People actively bait cloaky ships and if you get caught, you very likely can’t disengage. Sometimes, the Ishtar you tackle scrams you and lights a cyno. Sometimes people uncloak even scarier shit right on top of you. Your only way out is to kill literally everything that has a point on you. If I get into a bad situation flying a dual prop Dramiel, most of the time, I can just bail. Maybe the isk risk is proportional, maybe it isn’t, but I definitely have an easier time not dying in frigates when I get myself into a bad situation.
---
Hah, ok sure you can be the designated fuel truck or cyno bitch from now on. Let’s see how much fun that is for you my friend.
---
Yup, honestly, those corps are much better for FC types that can make shit happen.
---
The newbros become SUPER dependant on the FCs, while the FCs get shit tons of cannon fodder.
---
Wrong on your first sentence. Did not read rest.
---
This truly elevates the thread.
---
And yes, chat logs like that can be faked pretty easily, but I doubt a KF recruiter has any reason to do so.
---
Rip
---
Yupido, but you would never do it - you would just drop caps, errytime XD
---
instant cynos play a big role in non-consential pvp
---
 hunting super move ops? gone
---
solo dropping? gone
---
staging caps in hostile space? gone
---
yea cyno inhib state is retarded and ccp is dumb for only lowering volume these past years.  Making cynos deployable will just make content even more instanced and less spontaneous than it is now.
---
You karmafleet peeps sure are nice guys
---
Have you ever tried it? Because if you have general sense and awareness of what and where the space of grid is then it honestly can be quite thrilling, as long as stuff is happening obviously
---
Really? Which ones?
---
"nO ur the one who's crying", good one m8. 
---
I said that because you made an alt Reddit account specifically to complain about recent Eve patches and comment about 5 times a day on said alt account. So yes I'd say you're pretty butthurt.
---
Have you lived in w-space, with the blob-countering mass &amp; connection timer mechanics? At least in the earlier years of it, these mitigated the incentives to just cram warm bodies into a single home area and somehow still provide them with sufficient PvP &amp; PvE.
---
I've long suggested the main eve gates map could do with some interruptions, some galactic space weather that makes &amp; breaks logistic lines, flank routes, etc. But that'd still require fundamental fixes to logistics being gate-based rather than jump-drive based, and a reason to have constant smaller wars &amp; entities. It'd probably need dynamic resources &amp; depletion too, unlike the old tech moon situation. IDK the details of newer moon ore mining though, but I don't hear of it fragmenting the donut or people making plays for small suddenly-rich constellations to hold for a few weeks at a time.
---
Cared enough to reply
---
From zero to blustering dick in less than 40 seconds.
---
oof
---
/u/ccp_falcon
---
There you go
---
Depends what you mean. If you mean appear on grid (close enough to be on your overview) then yes, run. If you mean appear on dscan, then it depends. 
---
If you are in nullsec, wait for probes to show up on dscan before you run. 90% of the traffic through null has bigger things to do than kill a random explorer. 
---
If you’re in wormholes, then I’d bail as soon as you see anything on scan. Wormholers often scan and bookmark all the sites in the holes that connect directly to their home, but usually don’t run them because wormhole ratting is more isk/hr than doing cans. So, if they see you, odds are they’ll go hop into a cloaky ship to go hunt you with. Maybe finish the site if you are feeling lucky and only have a few cans left, but that is testing your luck. 
---
Also, remember to drop your loot off frequently so you don’t die with a ton of isk in cargo. One way around this is to explore in nullsec, and carry a depot. Before you run any sites, anchor the depot and put all your loot in it. If you die, come back in an interceptor and get the loot.
---
Toni is a nice guy, he just doesn't like people misrepresenting his actions.
---
You can still get Proteus to warp *much* faster than a Stratios, doesn't have to gimp entire fit to get expanded launcher, and you get nice 20.9km scram range with heated true sansha scram - which is more than enough when you're doing short warp to probe result. For heavy tackle/hunter with cyno duty it's still arguably one of the best ships out there as long as you don't need to go nullified.
---
What a jizz rag...
---
Blackout doesn't solve the Rorqual, Cyno, SuperCap umbrella problem.   
---
It hurts the little guy who isn't under the SuperCap umbrella with a cyno.  
---
Now essentially there is a cloaky camper in every nullsec sytem.  
---
I'd gladly trade the jump bridges and the panic modules away for deployable Local platform.
---
&gt;shits on your agility 
---
nice euphemism of hiding the fact that you turn slower than a Supercarrier...
---
In two of the rooms the biggest rats were cruisers and I just let my drones take care of them if they aggroed me. Most of the time the farmer bots killed them before the NPCs could do any real damage to me.
---
Don't forget that you also like to form caps for a "squad of t3c's".
---
My point is the problem with the state of eve. 
---
If you aren't good enough to handle 50 destroyers work your entire corps - then you should not be able to own a single capital ship. 
---
Capitals should be extremely rare things that are a huge deal when one undocks. Instead they are just a ship that everyone fields as an as button.
---
Can I still downvote you if I live in a C2-Null?
---
Surely it has longer faction scram with its bonus than other T3 no? Tbfh I have no idea how you'd take advantage of that when every gank target should be able to apply to &lt;20km with no probs and the prot is limited to drones/rails 🤷‍♂️👎
---
I 2 am gay
---
They were between 10-20km. The VNI scrammed me so I thought it was bait, but they shot him too.
---
did you get demoted to PR?
---
No I just don’t remember what tis they had kusion on and he admitted that to bump for some amount of time without attempting to make a kill is griefing.
---
Shocking, truly shocking.
---
Which ones did I complain about? I forget from all the crying.
---
Doing the lords work.
---
&gt;  since KF apparently takes months to join for some reason. I got  automatically rejected within a day, accused of having multiple accounts  and being a spy. Just for being part of said previous nullsec Corp. 
---
These last statements let anyone who knows anything about KarmaFleet (even our enemies) that you are completely full of shit.
---
Thank you for playing.
---
Which is actually fine and most people willl not hold against him.
---
At least he said Thank You Tooni
---
I heard EVE-Scout will go on 'BLOPS' roams - their hunters will tackle something, and then they just drop a ton of falcons on them with jams and fireworks.
---
I makes me sad that this meme is no longer about the cloaky Proteus :(
---
Tengu and Proteus are still a bit better than Loki for blops hunting by a large margin - Loki has huge issue of not enough medslots to fit both tank, tackle and ship scanner (you need to either give up point or scram in order to fit ship scanner), while Tengu still can do somewhat okay with an XLASB cheapfit when you need nullification. If nullification is not the case, then 20+km initial scram from Proteus is usually enough to skip longpoint in favor of ship scanner and getting 8.6AU/s and 3.5s align with cheapfit (630mil total including WS-610) Proteus outshines all potential non-nullified competition, unless you're either bridging a blob (so no need for ship scanner) or expect to feed lots of hunting ships to gatecamps etc. - in both cases just switch to Prospect.
---
Well if you get a web on it you can catch up and get in blaster range, and if you hear a cycle of mwd you can hopefully hold that point just long enough to get back in web range. I mean it's definitely a small benefit, but yeah speed would probably be just as good or better.
---
Not op, but I agree.
---
This isn't two friends having a beer and talking about fw.
---
It's people on Reddit trying to hash things out. Line by line and quoting makes it much easier to follow a train of thought.
---
Especially when it turns into this sort of parrellized conversation where you are discussing multiple things which would usually be done sequentially face to face
---
That's disgusting
---
EVE reddit detective mode activated!
---
ok, I'll give you that, they indeed are not like Bastion, Lawn and TNT which were never able to do anything by themselves, always being carried by goons hand.   
---
But independent...nope...in the last years goons say "jump", init asks "how high?".
---
In that sense, SNUFF is more independent, strong alliance that don't need no goons, than INIT.
---
&gt; So fit it in was which there's
---
sorry what?
---
Well, CCP has never been great at balance
---
Maybe I don't understand. My view is pretty simple. If you cannot afford to loose it don't fly it. If you won't risk what you CAN afford to loose and are too scared to pull the trigger then your a green killboard coward. Change my mind.
---
I find super ratting too intensive to use anything else. Sure, you can use VNI alts, but that makes less money than concentrating on the super.
---
450+M Isk/H supers are a thing.
---
so proper game balance should exclusively be based on overall grind/money invested and not things like personal skill, experience, intel, awareness and a multidimensional and diverse meta.
---
are you a mobile gamer by any chance?
---
This would be catastrophic for all 3 people using an autocannon Loki out there
---
tldr
---
Frigates tend to come in all races btw, so it's more likely you'll be applying a 1.62 jam when you see an assortment of jags/retributions etc.
---
Its never said that, and never will. If you feel you were duped because you cant actually read the numerous dev blogs, articles, or responses here on reddit, then I don't know what to tell you.
---
The old trial expired after x days. alpha state does not. I suppose this is why they don't , and will not call it a trial, but I'm just guessing.
---
When I want to know what I am getting, I just read. 
---
You got what you paid for.
---
Literally 30 T2 bubbles for ONE gate.  
---
And then someone has the audacity to ask for the removal of nullification...
---
I was in the Channel at that time, iam not part of the Goons, actually i am a returning eve player who was previously in horde. And i was rejected by Karmafleet. But my 2 cents:
---
The chat which Tony Delancor posted is accurate, he let out some chatlines which werent part of the conversation between Artunius and him. Like Questions from other guys etc.
---
Funfact: Nobody accused him of being a spy. 
---
A little tip to Artunius: Don't share accounts when a friend of you has a character on one of your accounts THAT character has to be included. I don't know if this is accurate or not on your account, just wanted to let you know. And in the youtube video, on reddit and other forms via google you will find out that all Corporations will make a check of your ESI, latest when you want to go higher up like in Horde it was for Vanguard.
---
First, there is a difference between "ECM is not used in wormholes by competent players" and "a regular fixture in their fleets."
---
If you've watched any recently posted C5/6 heavy armor brawl videos by corps like HK, Hawks, NOVAC, AFK, etc, then you are literally blind if you've seen zero ECM.
---
Properly flown ECM ships are an amazing (arguably one of the best) counters to Triglavian ships. ECM Burst Damnations are unironically a thing.
---
Scorps are also used by several mid-tier WH groups in armor brawls where the EHP of the Scorp is high enough to provide enough time to land reps. If you'd like, I can spend time on Zkill to link specific battle reports since it appears you're too lazy to find them yourself.
---
How do you manually move fighters in space?
---
To revive a meme from Scrapheap Challenge and the old Crime &amp; Punishment eve-o forums (RIPx3):
---
&gt;Pathetic.
---
Can confirm the chat was unedited - I was there, and some other members of the chat asked if they could paste it in
---
No, Frigate T5s are more like 5-700m an hour depending on drops
---
Show me a Loki for less than 2b that can tank a carrier, and I'll stop using my 600M Tengu for BLOPS hunting, lol
---
They take like 45 hours to lock on to a sub cap, especially a bomber. You have time to see a yellow box, think “huh that’s weird. I guess the keep is manned”, panic about what to do, ask FC for help twice, and then warp off and it still won’t have you locked.
---
My point is that there’s an inherent risk to flying a T3C. That’s what you don’t seem to grasp. If you’re calling people cowards for not feeding ships for free, well, then I guess I’m a coward because I won’t do that regardless of what I fly. Still gonna keep flying my Tengu though because it’s fun when you solo kill a battleship and manage to warp out right as all his friends are landing on grid.
---

wow. that was fucking hard.
---
Dude, just shut the fuck up already.
---
meh, it would kill the smallgang playstyle less than most others. solo BOs, sure.
---
At least they don't have have like 250k+ HP, that would just be crazy, right? Imagine if they gave them that much health so they would take forever to kill.
---
i love flying them.
---
Dude STFU He asked you a simple question, one that gets asked daily... you got awfully defensive in one sentence, so - guilty of something much?
---
Holy shit a whole 20 million isk
---
The orca fit I use to haul stuff has 1.3M EHP

Me too, bro. Me too.

I hate this

I hate you

You get a sabre bpo

Oh man we were there last week, almost ran into those bubbles head-first... after some skirmishes, I took a tengu through to discover what they could possibly be hiding so desperately from the outside world. I was picturing fleets of rorquals roaming free, carriers ratting in asteroid belts, I don't even know. There was nothing. Not a rattlesnake in a haven, not even a catalyst in an asteroid belt. 
---
It's like they were camping that gate just for the sake of killing other people. Sick. Sick and disgusting.
---
Like I said, it's a beta test!
---
Love you too big fella!
---
dude went from zero to fuckboy in 3 replies.
---
The number of times I sat and watched people in wormholes is crazy. I'd leave toons for hours just watching a POS that had someone sitting in it. it's mind-blowing to sit back and think the number of hours I'd just watch someone, stalk them for their precious modules and a juicy kill.
---
30 aint shit. Wait till you "see" 200+. And by see I mean get blinded, because they overlapp and for some ungodly reason get extremly bright
---
Yeah, but unless they are MWD fit it might as well just be a point. Even if they are MWD, you better hope you can apply it before they burn out of range. That's where the shitty agility will hurt you, you accelerate like a dog turd. I'm not saying that given certain situations you wouldn't be able to catch them, but everything being equal, you're at a disadvantage. 
---
The web won't go any further than with any other ship. It's also much slower with an AB than most cruisers. If they web you as well, they'll outrun you eventually. 
---
The shitty DPS and tank of the Proteus hurts you all around no matter the situation.
---
PROTEUUUUUUUS
---
Exploration can be so hit and miss, and I think it's that gamble that makes it exciting.
---
Obviously it sucks when you're on a dry streak, but the payouts and so exciting.
---
Certainly more fun than a more stable comparative payout.
---
They fixed that. It used to be a lot worse.
---
If you just ring the bell out of the blue they are probably going to send  you off. I'd drop a mail to Falcon (or PM him here) and see if anything can be arranged in advance.
---
All of them lol, why not just be honest? You're upset that your isk source got nerfed.
---
Yes, you're right. [Rorquals](https://zkillboard.com/ship/28352/losses/) and [Every](https://zkillboard.com/ship/23919/losses/).

---
Something must be done, surely.
---
Nobody is sharing accounts with anyone. 
---
Once again, another accusation by the KarmaFleet fellows. How can I share accounts with the guy that -I- referred to the game? I put all of the characters on my SOLE SINGLE account onto your application. 
---
I have only played the game 19 days. I have not seen any purpose/rhyme/or reason to pay for two accounts.
---
Wow... That is a lot!!
---
I've been able to atleast fit a few RLML on there. That's more than enough to pop a Noctis
---
Thanks for calling me a stupid fuck, you stupid cunt.
---
Just like how any other companies treat casual visitors
---
Remember when bubbles were insanely bright?
---
Yeah they get super duper tough to kill. You can always be ganked in them, but it quickly reaches the not worth it category of your opponents needing like 80 talos
---
Q click I think
---
iam not part of Goons or Karma as i stated, so i assumed which i said i do that you have maybe a shared account. To quote myself: Don't share accounts when a friend of you has a character on one of your accounts THAT character has to be included. I don't know if this is accurate or not on your account
---
eh, a medium and a few lights. it doesnt have that much CPU.
---
good luck on actually finding your name, hopefully its not corroded off yet
---
You can probably sell it. It’s not worth a ton, but 5M alts have some value to start injector farms for people without the spool up.
---
You see a sign saying "Please forward all inquiries to our new headquarters -  24, Simin-daero 327 beon-gil  Dongan-gu, Anyang-si, Gyeonggi-do, 14055, Rep. of KOREA"
---
Just whatever you do, don't arrive carrying small red containers.
---
No Problem.
---
Holy shit I could make 20m isk with a whole hour if not more of effort!
---
Thx &lt;3!!!!1!!!1!
---
tell fozzie to retire
---
My isk source is a venture in high sec. Didn't get nerfed.
---
Man people are such slaves to ISK in this game. It's so sad. Maybe taking some time off and doing something, god forbid, sub optimal will make you feel better!

🍿🍿🍿

Interesting sound track
---
You're welcome. 
---
Thanks for being such a "newbie friendly" Corp and driving newbies away from the games o7.
---
He's not wrong, you are a stupid fuck
---
Honestly I think it's fine if newer players are steered away from mining and ratting.  That shit is boring and an easy trap to fall into.
---
Inb4 the last can gets camped
---
Twice
---
Make ships jumping/bridging to a cyno
---
1. Delay in appearing in the target system proportional to the ships mass
---
2. Scatter inverse proportionally to the ships mass, with crigs out to an AU
---
3. Mass on the target grid negates both these things
---
Yeah, eve is best played with friends and it is clear that you have a hard time making any. Good luck.

Apparently it's because he's a whiny douchebag, and that comes across even in a five minute conversation with the guy.

Yeah they're run almost entirely with HAMs or artillery.

It's by region, not constellation. Isk/hr in C5/6 is higher but the maximum potential earnings is higher in null, unless you're doing nomad dreads or something but that's then a lot riskier.

If you do want to join another nullsec bloc I would recommend a new character and new personality first.  Most already have their quota of whiny, entitled assholes.

Okay.

I mean, in the logs he said he would look elsewhere. He apparently was rejected at his own behest, then cried to Reddit.

Step by step implementation. Cynos need a spool up and make the cyno ship a huge target. Massively increase sig radius when using cyno, after it spools up.
---
Done.

Hey that's helpful. Thanks!

If players have to do extensive google and FAQ searching just to find out what kind of "free" game they're getting into, then you're just doing it wrong as a publisher.

pseudo realism is an oxymoron, come to think of it as are you

 You have had frequent breakdowns both in game and here on Reddit. The issue isn't KarmaFleet, it is you.

We're a community first and foremost, not everyone fits in to the community, I'm sure you understand.

Since the rework you can maybe pull ~60k ehp out of an HK, a lot less scary than they used to be.
---
And you are correct, it's much more efficient just to lob a lot of bombers at them for that price. But that's a lot less badass.

I stalked a gila around for about 10 minutes before watching a tengu+2 blops drop on it right before I was about to pounce. Was hilarious.

Are you on drugs? You might want to check, or possibly just OD on that fentanyl or something.

The locals are total bads. If you bring a decent comp you can farm them off their own bubbles, that is, if they even undock for you.

Which they rarely do, unless you go there in 2 people, then they camp you in with 3 ramjags and a bunch of whatevers.

Extended reading shouldn't be required. CCP simply shouldn't suggest F2P in the first place.

Now THIS is space submarine warfare!

&gt;The stale state of null is a direct consequence of ~~capital/supercapital ships and cynos~~ skill injectors.
---
Fixed your post and gave you a tl;dr
---
I don't usually comment on why I'm rejecting applications.. But hell you unsubbed citing me as the source of it.
---
I rejected your application because you're an entitled idiot that I didn't want infecting our community.
---
Why would you ever go into the proving grounds not pvp fit?
---
The problem is some ECM ships were originally meant to be light long range fleet support (Griffin) and others were meant to be something more like close range brawlers(Widow) . The long range ships still function great with the new ECM but the short range ones don't have a role anymore.
---
There is a legend that if you deploy just enough bubbles for the server to be as near to overload as possible, it will nullify interdiction nullifiers.
---
I'm sorry living in supposedly the most dangerous area of space is too hard for you, so you need to defend broken mechanics that actually make it the safest area of space with the highest amount of rewards bar none in the entire game :(
---
Truly i am. Fingers crossed ccp keeps pandering to risk averse blocs of tens of thousand of players so they can watch their game slowly die only to keep those people playing by plexing without them giving any real money back :(
---
See what i did there? ;)
---
ok, what is the story with eve-mogul ? why are ppl shooting its structures ? ( rip my orders in ashab)
---
Seconded. I've been having a blast.  When gangs come roaming in we're more likely to engage each other because no one can see local spike.  There are just more people getting caught and forcing each side to commit and escalate.  More kills had overall.
---
 I totally get it.  I think my record is 3 weeks, camping a C6 in a bomber hoping to drop on a Noctis.  
---
Wormholers are a little "special"
---
this
---
do folks still do that shit?
---
bubbles decay now thankfully.
---
It sounds like you don’t like ambushing people. Try another play style.
---
I'd rather see something more like keep reactivation time 10 minutes change active time to 5 minutes and then add a module or a script for an existing module that reduces the current remaining activation time by 50% on the targeted ship.
---
Dude lights a cyno and it's gonna be up for 5 minutes, your hunting party was prepared and 4 of you use the module on him, the first reduces 300 seconds to 150, the second takes 150 to 75, the third 75 to 37 rounded down, the fourth to 18 seconds.
---
The response fleet now has 18 seconds to decide to jump and do it. The cyno goes down and the pilot can't reactivate the cyno for 10 minutes still.
---
Keeps the value of being ready to jump but trades off a slot on a few ships for reducing the power of an umbrella.
---
Actually, it benefits those with the skills, assets, and organization to withstand a drop.
---
Saying that it advantages nobody is incorrect, because the following advantages given by a big group and player SP/Assets are compounded.
---
1.Massive Intel channels give larger groups a level of "somewhat local" (a brownout, not a blackout, if we're talking power). Smaller groups get nothing and are effectively isolated (they need to dedicate way more scouts/active member to get the same info)
---
2. Heavily tanked ships with cynos give bigger assets the time to actually withstand a drop. Newer players don't get this benefit, as the ships that they fly can't long enough for help to arrive
---
3. Massive groups can respond with more home-defence assets. Whether this be a super umbrella, bridged fleets,  or a standing fleet that warps in, bigger groups can actually show up and fight off bigger roaming targets.  Previously, the smaller group would see the bigger group coming and hide.  Now they either get no warning, or (more likely)  just don't show up at all. 
---
The blackout Is BAD for smaller groups, the blackout is BAD for newer players. The blackout is good for hunters, and it's more of a brownout for bigger groups.
---
If the goal of this is to push every 0.0 resident onto goons, brave, test, horde, or frat, this is a good thing.  If you value smaller groups trying to live in 0.0 on their own, this is a BAD thing.
---
5 people with 500 dps each would only need 100 seconds.
---
Because... I don't like being accused of having characters that I don't have? I just joined the game, moron. How would I infect your community of Mittani Cumdumpsters?
---
All of my characters that I personally have were declared (once again: https://imgur.com/a/HBdMeND), you assumed that I was playing as my friend, who is on a different IP... in a different state... and you have people on here accusing me of sharing my account with him on top of it, downvoting any conducive replies that are anti-GSF.
---
Only need train the 5's once for proty and legion since you have something to do anything they can do better.
---
Wardec them and get the botters to dock up?
---
Can you share the fitting?
---
My fit is used for fleet buffs/mining/tank, and I can reach 500EHP with it.
---
need more bubbles...that is not enough
---
I never liked leaving my only decent alt for too long. I left it as a scout for an eviction for about that long learning their patterns. I miss this game sometimes. But for a noctis???
---
For the billionth time. 
---
Blackouts have done nothing to neutralize or equalize a super shield. It just reinforces the mentality that the only viable long term play in null, is with a coalition that has oñe
---
Very accurate. To summarize all that, we could just say there is not enough room for asymmetric counterplay to capitals.
---
So basically subcaps are balanced for the most part and keep receiving various balance passes over the years to keep warfare assymetric and interesting . It maintains the old, tried and tested method of "you can apply good damage to your own class of ships, one class lower and one class higher".
---
The reason everyone currently uses caps is because they are too good at too many things. They shouldn't be able to track anything below a battleship. Also, give cynos a spool up time and slightly buff inhibitors as suggested, and watch the problem solve itself in the long run.
---
I would literally crap my pants if 4 Lokis uncloaked on me. Might as well skip the brawl and die.
---
ever been to TXJ-II in Provi?
---
Considering they volleyed my Stratios before I got reps off, that’s effectively what happened.
---
Worked fine for me
---
As long as you can use a cyno orthrus to drop a minokawa on a hecate and a catalyst the game will remain in acompletely shite state.
---
​&gt; Ummm, yes? I think everyone, even CCP realizes the issues with the version of Supercapitals Online that Eve has become.
---
Sadly there is a large amount of people I've been replied to that believe this current state of EVE is fine.
---
I'm not accusing you of violating the TOS, I suspected you had an alt and brought it up, which I do daily to so many people. you're the only one that had a tantrum over it.
---
I think people are down voting you because your replies are stupid.
---

wut
---
Per bubble, so that's almost an hour
---
If you don't see anything its probably already docked. but yeah those bubbles has made some fun fights happen.
---
Yeah like a year ago lol
---
So your 5 man gang would only need 50 minutes to clear the bubbles shown in the screenshot?
---
That sure seems like a fun way to spend an hour.
---
1. Potatoe/Potato. If they were that awesome they would be in a doctrine. Just because somebody grabs an ECM ship while everyone else is flying something more useful doesn't make them good.
---
2. C6 brawls are a thing of the past. They almost never happen. C5 brawls are few and far between. I've never seen that hero ECM ship that just shut down the other side and tipped the scales to victory. They're a nuisance more than anything. Easily dealt with now that jammed ships can lock them.
---
3.  Anything that keeps Trig ships from reaching a full spool up could be considered a counter. What are the odds of landing a jam on a sufficient amount of the enemy fleet to make a significant difference? Given an avg pilot skill of mostly 4's in the relevant skills and the same for a pilot flying a Leshak, you get about a 28% chance of jamming per cycle for a Scorpion vs a Leshak. If the Leshak pilot were to add a Sebo with an ECCM script though, that drops you down to a 14% chance to jam per cycle. Burst jammers are about the same chance but they also have the drawback of friendly fire as well. You're going to break everyone's lock.

Next time we´ll ping for a drekavac fleet and have them spool up on one bubble each.  
---
FUN FUN FUN  
---
For real, there should be some sort of a hard cap on how much garbage you can anchor off a gate.  
---
Being able to bubble 140+ km in literally every direction is extreme aids.
---
And when you set up on a juicy kill and see someone jumping him and for a moment think "Hey, wait, that is not us". "Guys, jumpjumpjump, the party just got way better and more fun."
---
Now we just need a Bifrost and Stork to go with it.
---
Now we just need a couple of command destroyers to go with it :\^)

On a serious note, nice work!

Kinda funny to see how they even had to ping for a fleet to go kill a Leshak and an omen navy.

Solid post dude, totally agree.

Praise be with BOB

A Blockade Runner can go to a maximum of 120k cold ehp, 500kehp hot (calculated using Corpus X-Type Armor Hardeners and Pith X-Type Shield Hardeners and Pithum A-Type Adaptive Invulns). It'll be more agile, carry 60k cargo and have that +2 warp core strength, but this doesn't matter all that much if you get ganked. It also costs 4-5 billion.
---
The Orca gets on a T2 fit, 620k ehp cold and 710k ehp hot. It only costs 750m and hasn't been bling fit yet. It will only haul 30k, but if you use its 400k ship maintenance bay and 188k ore hold, in practice, you cam often haul much more.
---
2 weeks of scanning an entrance 4 days a week to jump what I knew to be a 5B marauder. And then some retards in my own alliance cleared the sites in the hole despite it being flagged. Over a week waiting for the sites to built up. And ofc the one day I get home an hour late some other group got him. 10 B with lots of purple dropping...
---
Wow. Great bedside manner. Also.... if he wants to use his black ops, he can use his damn black ops. Don’t be an ass. Will he get caught one day on bait? Maybe. But if he enjoys the game in the meantime... good on him. Because it’s a damn game.

You're taking affront because a stranger asked you whether an associated character is an alt of yours? In a game that's widely-renowned for its spying meta?

---
You don't need to nerf super ratting IMO because it's not a scalable activity like rorqual mining is. If anything, make rorqual mining more of an active thing to reduce the ease of which it can be multi boxed.
---
I think it is still important to remember that these are the apex ships and they should be good at what they do. It just needs to be harder to do and involve more skill. Mining has been such a braindead activity for so long.

Thanks for being my risky click of the day.

Question about applying missile damage.  I was with a friend in a WH yesterday trying to hit sleepers with a stealth bomber and three torpedo launchers.  I had two T2 painters on my target while throwing volleys of Torps out.  But my damage was sooo bad.  Like 30-400 damage each strike.  
---
Once or twice it would jump to 1300.  What gives?  How can I reliably apply that 1300 dmg?
---
The funny thing is that I lived in a WH for a bit on an alt. I did not really care for it. The sense of losing your connection and ending up super far from home wasn’t fun to me. Maybe I will give it a try again some day...
---
Making cyno inhibs actually repairable by logi would be nice too.
---
Wow, I guess for over a decade while people only having a single account was common there were no corps in nullsec!
---
Multiboxing is cancer. It's a cancer to MMOs as a whole that inevitably kills them by essentially requiring new players to shell out hundreds of dollars, and it's one of the things killing EVE.
---
I still to this day say that the calculation for jamming should have been that if the jam strength is stronger than your sensor strength, then you get jammed, if not then its chance based, but if your sensor strength is greater than the jam strength then the jam cycle time is reduced proportionally to the difference. 
---
Example 
---
Jam strength 10
---
Sensor strength 0-9.99 = jammed
---
Sensor strength 20 = chance to jam + 50% reduction jam cycle for the target
---
This would benefit targets that have greater sensor strength.
---
Here, have my upvote sir! Very well said!
---
Skill injectors is a whole new bag of dicks though, and honestly the main use of those among the people I know are to train up a new rorqual alt to add to the rorqual army. You make it impossible to multi box them and I think the skill injector market will take a hit.
---
I'll bite, but this is my final response; not interested in continuing this discussion with someone who moves goalposts as much as you.
---
1. I'm not sure what the fuck you're talking about here. There are literally doctrine ships in several corps that involve ECM. I gave several examples on my previous post.
---
2. The first part of your statement is 100% wrong. The second part - what? Where did I state, or even *imply*, anything about a, "hero ECM ship that just shut down the other side and tipped the scales to victory"? Are you even reading what my posts or are you skimming and responding to some made up argument? Additionally, ECM bursts, one of the **specific examples** I gave, break lock on targeted ships - they do not function the same as single target ECM.

&gt; Anything that keeps Trig ships from reaching a full spool up could be considered a counter.
---
Really? That must be why I referred to ECM as "**ONE** of the best", and not "the only." Again, are you reading what I'm saying?
---
Anyone who knows me knows what is coming next.
---
Scorpion: Assuming 5 Radar jams each with a strength of 10 and a Leshak sensor strength of 65.9 (1 ECCM scripted SEBO), that results in a 15.2% chance to jam per cycle **per module**. This results in a ( 1-(1-.0152)^5 ) = 56.2% chance for a Scorp to jam a Leshak every 20 seconds (assuming no heat on the jams). I guess the 14% you posted is assuming that the ECM ship only has one jam... vOv
---
ECM Burst (ship is irrelevant, let's pretend Damnation): Jam strength of 9, which is very similar to the 10 used earlier. Utilizing the same math you get a 13.6% chance to jam each Leshak per cycle. Assuming there are 5 Leshaks within jam range (in reality this could be higher, as several fights I've seen this used in have had 15-20+ Leshaks *per side*), this results in a 52% chance ( 1-(1-.136)^5 ) of a jam per cycle for utilizing literally 1 mid slot.
---
Of course, as you stated, these could result in friendly fire. That's why fleets practice a concept called controlling range to ensure it doesn't happen.
---
TLDR: Stop making factually incorrect statements then moving the goalposts when you get called out.
---
So, you think if CCP just banned multiboxing let’s say tomorrow. That this decade plus game would flourish into the platinum age? I’m sure all those incredibly dull tasks fulfilled by alts would be oh so gloriously fun to be fulfilled by mains. Should we also have to update our skill ques one skill at a time as well? Your Dino brain is showing.
---
Thanks for keeping this butthurt baby away from the promised land!
---
This is ridiculous. Bubblefucking gates makes it unfun for both attackers and defenders. The anchoring distance for mobile warp disruptors should be hiked up to 100km from stargates.
---
lol this is true.
---
I'm not his alliance leader banning him from flying ships. It was just funny how he wanted to smug when it was a stupid move.
---
I was more making fun that every single one of them was 0.00%

Might be time to talk to a therapist in real life about how your insecurities could be affecting you

---
You don't get to be a fucking coward and remove this u/Artunius
---
As a new player, I myself was targeted by an automail to join one of these said Corps. I said to myself, "Hey, what could it hurt? If I don't like them I'll just leave". Big mistake, once you join one of these Corps, you end up apparently screwing yourself out of any future opportunities in the game.
---
I gave the Corp a good while to see if it would click, didn't make any acquaintances, didn't receive much guidance... so I decided to take my leave and do things for myself. I don't really have anything bad to say about them, it's just I didn't feel like I would be anything more than a cog in a machine.
---
I did some research and it looked like KarmaFleet took themselves a little more seriously. My buddy and I made a little newbie Corp while we waited, since KF apparently takes months to join for some reason. I got automatically rejected within a day, accused of having multiple accounts and being a spy. Just for being part of said previous nullsec Corp.
---
I'm really starting to see why the newbie experience here is so bad and why people quit.
---
His reddit posts on the other hand......
---
Yes! I have been following that!
---
Don't get me wrong, prot def is a turd atm. Just originally replied that in a very specific range you can dictate range against most other ships. But like I said that range dictation is hard to translate into an dps/application advantage.
---
They will miss your 15 bucks
---
no u
---
Im sorry you think that the game needs to hand you nerfs to make it the most dangerous space by your hand :( 
---
Truly I am. Fingers crossed ccp keeps pandering to risk averse crybabies who want to gank tens of thousands of players until they all quit while paying for their pvp with plex without putting any real content back into the game :(
---
In all seriousness. The devs didnt, and never have advertised nullsec as "everyone will kill everyone easily, so you will DIE MUHAHAHAHA DIE LOTS NOOB DIE"  No.  They said there is no NPC police, and players make it what they want.  Players made fortresses, and you dont like that so you wanna cry about it because you REALLY wanna go kill people in that one specific area and that one specific type of player.
---
That isn't ccp's problem.  That's your problem.  Cry, blame the economy, blame the game, blame botters, blame whatever you want while crying to get your risk free kills.  If it happens this game truly will die because the big groups will abuse it 100x smarter and harder than you ever could.  
---
Sit back down now.
---
"Toni: Is that character an alt of your's?" "You: no. It's my friend's character." "  "Toni: Invite sent."
---
It was just that simple. But instead, it was "Toni: Is that an alt of your's?" "You: damned cunt. Reeeeeee Reeeee." "You moving on to reddit: reeeeee. reeeeee".  "Everyone: lol. what a complete douche".
---
What "small groups" were living in 0.0 before?
---
if you need more man's send me a dm, i might be able to help friend
---
You were rejected immediately after stating in a public channel you would look elsewhere? THE HORROR!
---
Nothing is factually incorrect
---
1. I have never seen a recent doctrine involving ECM. The nerf to ECM mde them much less desirable to other alternatives.
---
2. Why fly ECM when there are better option for a useful pilot. Most decent corps/FCs know this. 
---
3. If you want to put all of your jams on a single target then congratulations, you managed to neutralize exactly one ship.  
---
4. So you're going to drop a burst fit ship in the middle of their fleet and your fleet is going to be out of range? It's going to die very fast or get neuted to shit and not be able to jam at all. 
---
We'll just agree to disagree on this particular matter
---
Thank you for your enlightment
---
I'm not sure, but I've seen killmails of people who may have used the wrong conduit by accident or something
---
Yes, those tangentially related to the larger groups, and those who live in npc 0.0.
---
Stain is WAY quieter than normal, due to these changes. That's BAD for the health of 0.0 as a whole
---
I mean.... it isn’t the dude who dropped who posted bro... so maybe chill out with the superiority complex a little.
---
Nothing of value was lost.
---
\*laughs in Russian*
---
Just make them killable in a reasonable amount of time. That way you would have to at least watch them.
---
I dont think so. Groups are more willing to roam again. Fights are actually happening, rather than just cap drop, done. 
---
No, I think you just dont like change, and are salty about it.
---
Lol, seeing freighters to "escape" might hurt you if you deem ganking a freighter PvP.
---
It wouldn’t. The strong would gobble up the assets of the weak or they would join the blobs before that would occur. Both situations only further feed the blobs
---
"We'll just agree to disagree on this particular matter" is what people who refuse to admit they are wrong say. But ok. Have a nice day.
---
The person I replied to is the one who dropped the Sin. The OP linked the KM and then he wanted to wave his hands around like "Look at me"
---
No. No buffing T3Cs. Just stop it already. They were *just* nerfed.
---
They're Cruiser hulls and you can't make it so they outperform T2 Cruiser hulls. There's a limit to how useful they can be before they just become the defacto Cruiser hull, like they were before the nerf.
---
This change was announced at Eve north, I'm pretty sure before the new CSM was even announced, but definately before they would've been able to influence ccp
---
Fair enough
---
My bad. The problem with Blockade Runners is that they just don't haul as much as an Orca or a Deep Space Transport. At that point, it's almost better to get a cloaky sub 2s align ship so that gankers don't insta-lock and blap it.
---
NPC null died with the moon changes not with the local changes tbh
---
If the blobs feed each other, it would be good for the economy, no?
---
You're the one who said you were done posting. I was just agreeing that we weren't going to reach a consensus
---
Careful don't get banned for excessive bubbling
---
I mean I wouldn't care for super/titan heavy gameplay if they would actually used in fights instead of dropping them on roaming gangs or figths wich are 0% risk of losing one.
---
There is. Unless ccp changed it they have literally banned people for bubbling before
---
They wouldn’t. They would just gobble up the shitty little alliances assets and grow and grow. I say they when I really mean goons.
---
You are a bundle of fun. Said person saw himself in a post that he didn’t do and laughingly said hi. So you decide to tell him how much of an idiot he is for enjoying the game his way. 🤷‍♂️ I call you out for being a tad bit of a asshole. It’s cool. You don’t have to justify it.  Fly dangerous bro. o7
---
CCP never actually implemented this. They just said they would.
---
*weeps sadly in Drone Region Carebear-language*
---
Needs more tilde
---
Jamming fighters is a pretty viable way to make carriers completely useless. Thats done mainly on smaller groups of them not big blobs however.   
---
But saying that using ECM (and that includes EC300) is impractical against carriers shows that you can't have used carriers much outside of blob warfare and "hyperdunks".
---
I did not, thanks for telling me /s
---
Nah I'm a pretty big asshole.
---
And now compare this to how many are used on a daily basis.
---
chisp are fucking over it lol
---
You're a dickhead.
---
You sound like a fun guy. Clearly dropping a Sin on a Noctis is stupid - let the dude have his fun. Look at how many people got entertainment out of this scenario? Lighten up a bit
---
But snuff needs init?
---
What is a good hotkey setup for combat? I've mostly been clicking but since starting to solo/small gang more I want to transition in to using the keyboard.
---
You've proposed a complex solution but haven't grabbed any of the extremely low hanging fruit.
---
The largest factor for having few 'gudfights' is that there's really no incentive for others to fight you.
---
Nothing to do with marshmellow-testing people with delayed rewards
---
I mean, the peak of the games flourishing was back during that era so yes?
---
&gt;guhh if you like any QoL features at all you dinobrain
---
No. Multiboxing is on an entirely different level from QoL features; it directly impacts gameplay in negative ways in every game it features heavily in.
---
I am trying to figure out what went so fucking wrong that you got where you are right now.
---
It s easier to play at 5000 vs 1000. More news tomorow....
---
Because clearly having a corp name referencing buttfucking is so much more entertaining. What are you retards, 10 yrs old?

Newer players can tag along for mining, but there's no real way for them to tag along with ratting since anoms are designed only for one person.

they've warned people for posting hundreds of cans around a gate to decloak due to "lag"
---
Is just pixels, who gives a fuck? If the man wants to drop a Sin on a Noctis he should drop a Sin on a Noctis, anyone who says different is just being an ass. He has literally nothing to lose but imaginary video game points.
---
Frankly I've had just about enough of this risk averse mentality of yours. PvP would be more interesting for all of us if everyone thought like that guy.
---
Imagine not only thinking this, but also writing it, and pressing the post button.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butte
---
You don't have to be risk-averse to realize dropping that probably wasn't the brightest idea. There's a thin line between bravery and stupidity. 
---
Why crack a walnut with a sledghammer?
---
Why do you care about cloaky ships if you don't even live in null?
---
But if I do ever kill him cheers for some free iskies
---
News flash incursions have been going on for like 2 years now
---
(un)Luckily, we don't even have to imagine.
---
Upvote simple for the use of ‘chucklefucks’
---
Ahh, you're land preservationists. Well that explains everything. My fault, move along now. /s
---
Don’t forget to propose a dumbass change that only affects the 8 players that actually need it and put zero thought into it.
---
Extra points for tagging a ccp employee.
---
Do you read my post like you want to on purpose or not? In my starting reply i wrote about jamming the carrier with ec300, not the fighters. So if you just read what you want its meaningless to go on.
---
But lets Switch to your point.
---
Jamming fighters with normal ECM happened definetly and is/was a thing, but since booshers hit the game thats more prevalent. Furthermore if it didnt change, jamming a squad after it already locked does jam the first fighter, Not the whole squad so its effectiveness delends. . Additionaly i never have seen EC300 used for that, but i didnt say that never happened. And why cant you just stick to an argument without playing an ego game :D
---
The only metric by which you can even judge that idea to be bad is aversion to risk. 
---
To me its kind of funny, which means its a good idea. I also like having more possibilities of getting sweet Sin killmails, so its also a good idea in that way too.
---
Face it, you're just risk averse. You're trying to be practical in a fuckin fantasy video game - which is about the stupidest thing I've ever heard of. More people taking these kinds of risks makes PvP better for the whole community.
---
Thats helpful, thanks
---
Welcome to Blackout, quit your bitchin
---
Im alfa haw I earn 300m isk pr hour?
---
Keep an alt in your home hole and scan out to k-space if you don't have a route. Or have a buddy live with you that can scan you back in.
---
What's that old saying about only flying what you can afford to lose?
---
Not if he deletes them all before too many people read them!
---
You dunk bro?
---
Im glad.  I have 7m skill points and didnt specialize in a ship.  Poor choice on my part i guess.
---
I've seen worse, I was blops hunting in the arse end of the drone lands once time and no word of a lie, the bubbles were between 230km and 250km in every direction, shit load of abandoned drones around the gate also ... took feckin ages for three grid to load too!
---
ahhh nut the 64 bit client probably means your system can handle more items in space before it taps out
---
Do you have a mining permit?
---
The imicus i lost i can afford to replace.  The other two are the problem.  Never got to where i can make 300m isk per hour.  Was actually working on that with distro runs.  They seem impossible even in high sec, as l3s take me through incursion space lately.
---
You are not asking questions, you are trying to justify yourself
---
How this usually works:
---
HR: Hey man, how do you know Joeblow Noobz?
---
Applicant: Oh yeah, he's a guy I used to be in &lt;insert random wormhole corp&gt; with he hasn't played in a year or so.
---
HR: cool cool cool, tight tight tight
---
what about making super and titans 20x more expensive? These ships should be the exception, not the norm.
---
In a normal world with normal people lol
---
Just you
---
Maybe you should join your fellow coalition members when they go hunting in Delve
---
oh Jared Dale or whatever
---
In the who knows how many apps I've processed I've never seen anyone flip the fuck out about an "is this an alt" question. Some people.
---
&gt; You've proposed a complex solution but haven't grabbed any of the extremely low hanging fruit.
---
We have the low-hanging fruit in lists already.   They are linked in this thread somewhere nearby. 
---
This proposal is presented as an  enabling metric, like multi-timer plexes (also linked in thread), for supporting cooler milestone and endgame content for facwar without creating unbounded economic disasters or late-comer locust swarms.
---
Works fine for me.
---
Lol. Fair enough.
---
He started doing dumb stuff so people observe him more and donate stuff.          
---
Like " don't do DST in null" well guess, what he died and then hoped for people giving mu more isk.
---
You mean Jeremy Davids?
---
Lmao, nah they're trying to kill this shit heap by listening to retarded suggestions from you mouth breathers.
---
Yeah, that's a pretty retarded suggestion tbh, you should try skilling yourself and learn to shoot the fighters.
---
You seem to be getting the wrong idea about Eve. You seem to think that Eve is free to play. It's not. It's a subscription-based game with an indefinite trial.
---
The overused imagine phrase, so witty!
---
They have very little place at the moment.
---
Legacy coalition deserves worse. 😃
---
He became dependent on making ISK by people donating or overpaying for his services. Soon business dried up and he came back on a multi with another story to try and make it as a con artist 'outsmarting' eve.
---
I think the blackout should extend to all chats and you should only be allowed to chat in stations. You can have all your private chat rooms and shit but they are only accessible in stations
---
Literally unreadable
---
&gt;It's like they were camping that gate just for the sake of killing other people
---
The nerve of spme people. smh
---
Tbf the Levi pilot was dumb
---
Thats not how cccp advertises it.  Also, thats fine; but, im not going to sub for several months just to train to where i can survive in high sec.  Seems a poor choice for me.
---
a single rorq pulls in around 100 to 150 mil  an hour 1 excavator is around 500 mil . excavators are pretty easy to kill these days. Sure the umbrella can save the rorq but no umbrella is going to keep the excavators from dying
---
Imagine being this salty about a rorqual kill
---
Yup. I don't even like supercap gameplay. Old as dirt and I think I've undocked something battleship and up less than 50 times.
---
Oh that was us last night. They reanchored them after we blew through. They mad.
---
By stale you mean that the goons correctly saw the meta and capitalized on it while the other nullsec enties became the shitlords they hated.
---
Medium preki already suck...please no
---
Who?
---
&gt;so witty
---
Reading the Alpha Day 4 posts made me think about the Jared dale hauling service also
---
 Imagine clutching your pearls like this and pretending you're a man.
---
I run anoms with triple Ishtars quite often. If I can do that, a pair of new players could pair up. The help also doesn’t have to be on grid.
---
getting rid of injectors and nerfing alpha accounts would greatly improve the game
---
True. But he seems to lack the foresight.
---
I agree, but even without skill injectors, we still would've gotten to this point, just would've taken longer. Dockable supers and titans are what really created the madness. And infinite mining/ratting anomalies appearing faster than you can kill them.
---
Give people like 3 months notice, then titans/supers are no longer dockable. Restrict skill injectors to non capital skills. Make rorqual excavators use fighter mechanics. Maybe make ice much more rare so isotopes for jumping capital ships is a strategic item to not be wasted on dropping 10 titans on a garmur instead of the commodity it is now. Make athanors and raitarus only give tether to industrials. Make astrahuses only tether subcaps. I dunno, there need to be some sweeping game mechanic changes. There's a million things they could do. Blackout is just a shot at treating a few symptoms.
---
My highsec incursion alt is an alpha and joins TDF just fine. Just be smart and don't feed.
---
Very Great! I test printed a stratios, and it did ok, what machine did you use?  Also can you reccommend a good way to clean it without breaking any antennas?
---
Oh, the guy who's "done with it"
---
Pack it up, the guy who's done with it doesn't like it anymore. Glad we got this hot take.
---
Or he bottled it thinking that you were very overpriced bait :)
---
"I simply didn't want to wait until the incursion was over. It's my last day off this week and i wanted to get some distribution runs done." Its entirely on you then. The only thing you should be mad at is yourself for not wanting to be patient and not wanting to learn the invasion mechanics. Invasions and incursions are totally different FYI.
---
​
---
Note to self: eve is perfect, and any complaint gets met with "you're just wrong" even though the new xpac Incursion has killed it for me.  
---
sorry for taking my frustration out on this sub.  I can see i'm not welcome here, i'll be going now.
---
&gt; Be a rich alliance
---
&gt; Put observatories in a pipe before ratting/mining system
---
&gt; Intel bots are back
---
Thanks CCP
---
Its an unnecessary amount of bubbles though
---
If you mean they injected an army for every available task then yes.
---
Imagine not knowing satire when you read it.
---
Well we knew this was coming
---
Stupid bait post.
---
This will never happen, but Dynamic Sov Security levels would be awesome. What does Concord pay us bounties for? We're making null safer, so that -1.0 truesec system slowly goes to 0, if you keep farming, it becomes lowsec, then highsec even. Same with lowsec, if no one is there killing pirates, its sec status slowly decays and even will become negative. Players would have to move around and use more of their space. If the positive rate of change was fast enough and the negative rate was slow enough, this would make all kinds of interesting stuff happen.
---
Wouldn't be the first bubble-ception.

This change is bad for eve, not bad for me.
---
I'll personally make it out just fine. I'm still Rorqual mining, i'm still carrier ratting, i'll be perfectly fine if the blackout goes on forever. I live in a big block, and we're not really impacted by it much. The biggest change is that i've shifted to miner IIs when i'm not paying attention, rather than excavators.
---
But I can see outside of Delve, and what I see is concerning. I actually think about what impacts others, not just impacting me. People outside the big blocks aren't logging in nearly as much. This is BAD for eve.
---
Provide me HARD data that shows that more people are logging in, more things are being produced, that this is actually good for anyone besides roaming groups (the loud minority on /r/eve)
---
That's because it isn't there, or on the forums. Most people link the article when they post it too. That was a dead giveaway
---
\&gt; I waited for 20-30 minutes. That whole time hitting D-Scan every few seconds.

Not everyone is space rich enough to PVP with geckos.

The most dropped on ships are engaging in PvE, but you think they shouldn't be able to turn the tables on their attackers in PvP fit ships. You are a special kind of stupid.

yeah one usually entails the other

might be that the sleeper turned off its prop mod or something

two factors play into missile damage, sig radius and ship velocity. however webs can't always be relied upon due to short range.

Thats great for you; again not my style, and i wasnt aware that warping to a warp gate was considered feeding.  Thats great advice though; just dont die.  I hadnt thought of that.

---
I'm not in one of the mageblocks and honestly have never seen a cyno, but how is this not already a thing? You are sending out a flare that is bright enough people a system over can use it to find you, to the grid exactly. Everyone in the system should be able to get a target lock with the same angular error in measurements.

Una propuesta:
---
\-Compra CCP y luego obliga a los empleados a que traduzcan el juego y que todo se encuentre acorde a tus gustos.
---
Deja de decir sandeces, si no quieres jugar al juego por que no sabes inglés (y no saber inglés ahora es como firmar tu sentencia de muerte en la carrera profesional, en españa incluso para tener la titulación de la universidad te requieren tener un nivel básico de inglés - el FIRST para ser claros -, así que sin saber inglés no vas a llegar a ningún sitio la verdad), vete a otro juego donde esté traducido y doblado al español, crea tu mismo una traducción al español o haz lo que te he propuesto.

I mean, can you even read? He never accused you of sharing characters. He even stated as such in the post you replied to.

Goons roamed into our space and tackled a pvp fit carrier that was searching for content:  
---
I started forming for a retri roam and reshipped into caracals with logi to fight these pesty little frigs off.  
---
Before we arrived goons dropped a dread and killed the carrier and carrier pilot wanted to yolo drop his titan for the funnsies (I do not deny people content if they wish to risk their own assets - we are not elite - ohh my killboard has to be green - we are here for the fun.)  
---
Goons got dreadbomb in - Legacy fromed, cleared dreadbomb and fun was had on both sides GF all together - enjoy your titan kill as i do enjoy those dreadkills :)

---
I use a CR-10s. To protect the antennas (and make pulling off the supports easier) I turned off all supports in Cura. I then turned on Tree supports in the Experimental tab.
---
Then when pulling the supports off the antennas I used scissors to cut away most of the supports under the antennas. After that I still had a centimeter of support left. I then used my small cutters to cut lines perpendicular to the antennas. Then I wiggled/pryed off the rest of the supports.
---
I didn't quite do it that delicately, but that's roughly how. Honestly, just go slow and be cautious.
---
Wouldn't fix all the titans and supers that already exist.
---
Is doing anomalies in haw dreads a thing now?
---
Incursions are not solo content
---
Fired too early, CCP wouldn't have announced this so soon into the blackout. Should have waited till near the end, more people would bite.
---
go to an icebelt in hisec  lots of bots in them been that way for awhile
---
Goons don’t magically have dreads formed, that was preplanned and that’s what is called being fished
---
With exhumers you had a choice: mine fast, big hold, or good survivability. With the Rorq you have all 3, but better than the exhumers on all counts. Apex ship or not, something shouldn't just be a strictly better choice.
---
I am bad with names.  Ill be sure to remember that.  It is entirely on me, but it is still not fun to have to stop playing because npcs are invading.  Thought i could slip through, and failed.  Thats frustrating, but not why im leaving.  I admit ive made mistakes.  I was working on correcting that; the first step lately is to find a way to make at least tens of millions of isk per hour through missions.  With the current meta, and where my character is at i feel that is impossible without months of being subbed, and dealing with frustrating play or not playing to train.  
---
I feel like i am being left behind as a player, and the time or money inveatment doesnt seem worth it.  I want to play a fun game.  Having the equivilent of end game encounters in the newbie zone is not fun.
---
What’s whinging?
---
If it's cloaky it already can't be instalocked.
---
And blockade runners can still carry a lot more than non cargo ships.
---
“mighty” is a WEIRD adjective for a giant brick of pixels you can shoot and can’t shoot you back.
---
When did “eve is dangerous” become “eve should let me shoot defenseless things whenever i want &gt;: (“
---
I agree skill injectors are a problem and have accelerated the issue, but we would have got here with or without them, eventually.
---
self burn?
---
At least one person is doing it.
---
Missiles fuck you twice with their damage application, trying to apply Torpedo damage of all Missiles is even harder. Read [Wingspan "Torpedo Delivery"](http://www.torpedodelivery.com/new-products/torpedo-delivery-guide-wingspantt) for some hints at proper Stealth Bombers ( use the *minmatarlol* code to get it free) but usually in J.space you want other ships for ratting than Bombers, go for Gilas / Rattlesnakes those are usually very good.
---
Torpedos as weaponsystem are aidscancer to get them to apply properly. Sure there are meme fits out there like the Raven Navy Issue for Faction Warfare schenanigans with a thumb up your arse but otherwise noone really uses this weaponsystem.
---
Maybe some Golem fits make use of Torpedos while abusing several Missile Guidance Computers and Laserpointer at the same time.
---
Torpedos problems are the extremely huge explosion radius, horrible explosion velocity and short range. You need a special ship just like your Stealth Bomber with triple boni to Torpedo travel velocity and flight time so you have somewhat acceptable reach, also Stealth Bombers boost Explosion Velocity to apply better.
---
Unbuffed Torpedos can usually only track slow and big ships ... or structures. So in PvE only shoot NPC battleships with them and in PvP better aim at only battleships and capital sized vessels. Some battleships like the Machariel are huge as fuck but also fast and shit like a Nightmare wich is tiny and fast is a nightmare ^(see what I did there) to track so even your optimal sized prey might be prepared or hard to engage.
---
Torpedos usually don't apply against anything below Battlecruiser, maybe Cruiser size - depends on the fit. You need to fit shittons of Missile Guidance Computers and several different application modules!
---
If you look at Battleship Weaponsystems you usually prefer Cruise Missiles since they are way better, long range 120km+ per default while having better application alltogether! Rapid Heavy Missile Launchers are usually your melee range brawling weaponsystem of choice.
---
To make Torpedos work you need a dedicated hullbonus and several application modules, so outside of Golems, RNI and Stealthbombers nobody really uses that Missiletype.
---
There are [calculators](http://sisterofeve.ru/gmdc/) wich show you the damage done -**before resistances!!!**\- against targets of different velocity and size!
---
ofc it was - it was in range of curse
---
You mean CCP changed the meta by removing passive moons, turning Rorqs into a mining ship, adding citadels, and allowing titans/supers to dock and Goons continued playing exactly as they'd played before but with a huge buff to their own krabbing and a huge nerf to their enemies?
---
Then why are they surrounding high-sec warp gates?  Makes casual play impossible in my opinion.  I also think this will strongly deter new players, but hopefully i am wrong.
---
Yeah, we're aware of that. If you advertise something as "oh this game is free to play (it just has these extensive and restrictive limitations if you're f2p)" it comes out a lot better-sounding than "oh this game is subscription-based (but you can also play a free trial as long as you want)".
---
It's just simple advertising.
---
Incursions have been going on for nearly a decade. They won't be ending soon.
---
Also, why do you think people shouldn't be able to lock and shoot you in 2 seconds?
---
No, incursions have been many years longer than that. They weren't new when I tried them over 5 years ago.
---
That's what my post says.
---
It indeed shouldn’t be safe.  Quit being scared of risk, quit hiding behind the safety of your cloaked invincibility, uncloak and do something other than bitch for ccp to hand you free kills
---
Fucking hypocrite coward
---
You can survive in highsec day 1 though
---
But T3  Should be better than 2... It's in the number !
---
Welcome to Eve. If you don't like it, go back to high sec where you can be safe. We aren't going to stop roaming around because of one shitposter on Reddit
---
If you're doing small gangs, you can ask your corpmates about their own keybinds. A classic one is to use your F1-F4 keys for high slot modules, F5-F8 for mids, F9-F12 for lows. Ctrl-Clicking to overheat.
---
Roaming doesn’t mean having dreads prestaged and dread alts on standby
---
Is mwd then still preferable in assault ships because of the decrease in sig? And in a pvp scenario is mwd the way to go or are scrambles too prevalent?
---
We bubble holes occasionally, we only need like 4 max though.
---
They can.  Im not immuned to death.  My warp bubble hadnt left the screen yet while in high sec, saw i was warp locked, slowed, and a few other things before i could even hit a booster, and died.  
---
The point of that is to say even with thought behind how to slip through here; it was impossible.  That shouldn't happen in high sec.  This is end game content thrust onto noobs.  I am a noob, despite having played.
---
Oy geez yeah like 2010/11. I miss my original characters :( wish I didn't sell them and start over.
---
How many cynos you get in your wormholes?  Yeah, not the same thing.
---
 complain persistently and in a peevish or irritating way.
---
Think he went to school
---
Your usual shortcuts work on fighters.
---
Keybing Fighterselection and allways deselect your own carrier then just give them commands as usual!
---
No more than 2 rorqs mulitboxed per person. All problems fixed
---
&gt;I agree, but even without skill injectors, we still would've gotten to this point, just would've taken longer. 
---
Would we though?
---
The only groups that were ever in that situation were smaller very selective groups, the larger groups went through a culling every so often that stopped them from snowballing to that point.
---
Without an injector path the larger ships were unattainable to many people who just couldn't stomach the grind, injectors offer the shortest path through every grind and thus the gates were thrown open.
---
There was quite literally nothing stopping the larger groups from spooling up like this before other than the time it took to get it done, its not like EVE started 5 years ago, this games old AF at this point.
---
We have dreads staged in multiple places mate, and quite a few pilots are always on standby. Our treaty says the only restrictions are no entosis shit, no structure bashing, and no cloaky camping. That's it. Everything else is free game. That's Eve.
---
i think alot of nullbears unsubbed and left and the botters moved to hisec win win i guess
---
So my comment assumed you were using a ship with ECM bonuses. I agree that they are useless on ships without the bonus
---
Lol, I love ECM.  It is really interesting to see the strong feelings from some against it throughout the replies.  I'm guessing the trigger here though was mentioning WCS.
---
Well eve is different.  Unlike other f2p games it is a wonderful sandbox, but with invasion it seems like ccp is saying "dont bother buying expensive ships until you can survive invasion, or are super rich"  i worked hard for my ships and was proud of them.  I was planning on working hard again to get them back, but even that seems impossible.
---
Could go for Freighters, although they're a bit longer train.
---
I do, quite often aswell really.
---
Are you sure you are on the same server as the rest of us?
---
No, you sit back down. I've been around the cluster since 2004. Unless you've seen how things were before the current meta, you have fuck-all measure of comparison to argue any kind of superiority for the current meta and just going off of what is the only known state of things for you. It's just that a large part of the playerbase has turned into a bunch of instant gratification babies over the years and they think their version of events is the only version.
---
You guys have idea of how easy you have it today, and yet the game was so much healthier and more engaging back then that you couldn't even imagine.
---
Why do you think i'm playing as an alpha? Because the game is fun for extended periods of time? If it was, i'd be buying a sub.
---
I can fly full t2 fits for the majority of subcaps for 2 races in the game with near maximum fitting/engineering skills, i can fight well in a small gang (which means i can also do it in a fleet since it's waaaay easier) and know enough to keep myself safe in null and help others. I could easily apply to one of the blocs and comfortably plex 2 or 3 accounts in null (heck i can almost do it without leaving jita 4-4 already). Why won't i do it? Because the average flow of the game has gradually turned into slow-dripping molasses, tidi blobs that take ages to assemble, jump and load grid, only to blueball eachother for fear of losing their swarms of blinged-out behemoths. Well, fuck that, i'm not going to grind my ass off or pay money in order not to play the game.
---
Also, i think you were meant to hit reply under my comment and not post under the main thread.
---
you are correct on the treaty parts and on the take on how both sides of the deal act :) and I do like your attitude Cretannia.  
---
The dessies and retris were roaming - the dreads ofc were prestaged - I assume curse. Titan pilot was aware of the risk. My words: would be a big dick move your choice - he made a choice and gf was had. It is actually pretty funny that he is less sad than you are - It is eve - every ship exists for a timeframe and this timeframe comes to an end at some point.  
---
Gf Goons I enjoyed the engagement and so did many of my linemembers - all in all : A Day To Remember
---
Yes, let's talk about the flaw in my general statement, and focus on day 1.  I am worried about those that might stick around, not people just trying it for the first time.  Fuck those guys.
---
Paging [CCP\_Falcon](https://www.reddit.com/user/CCP_Falcon/) to a good ideas thread. 
---
Also inhibitors are pretty poor both in cost and usage.
---
First off, the negative responses you are getting is because you said incursions which is indeed end-game difficulty. You mean invasions.
---
Also your expectations are waaaay off in how much isk/h you will make. 300m/h is extremely high, especially in highsec where you are more or less "safe".
---
Ok, the last time I was in null before a 10 year hiatus, cynos and supers where brand new, the group I was apart of was always camping the gate to Torrinos in Lonetrek, or breaking up a camp so we could get freighters through.
---
What is the purpose of a bubble camp like this in a post super null?
---
I don’t know, because when I got back I joined a low-sec corp, then one day found a wormhole and only pop out to null for easy targets and exploration sites.
---
Do you understand “complete safety”?
---
Jesus
---
Griffin, blackbird, kitsune and scorpion all function well in my opinion, although they could all use a speed buff, which I do not believe would be power creep. 
---
Rook should be changed to have a ecm range bonus and a tank bonus, it has 180km lock range but the multispectral jammers have an optimal of under 40km...
---
Navy griffin needs a completely new bonus, it was bad form to change ECM and leave the navy griffin how it is.   Not sure how you could change it though?
---
&gt; The stale state of null is a direct consequence of capital/supercapital ships and cynos. 
---
Speaking of cyno, can they just add a spool timer on those so that it does not cyno instantly ?
---
It's great at blapping with blasters. Really risky tho. Make medium rails great again.
---
True in the aligning out during combst.  I was thinking about compensating a bit for the targeting changes removing our (RNG) self-protection.  Travelling to and from fleets rather than during combat.  The post was empty so it seemed a simple way to kick off the discussion.  :-)
---
I am getting really tired of these if it nerfs goons it also hurts the little guy arguments. 
---
Look at the kb the 500+ goon excavs that have died in the past week says otherwise. how many "little guy" excavs or rorquals died? a couple.
---
The weirdest thing about this remark is the notions that only the PVP-avoiding class is capable of making isk.
---
I already said this in a different response, but i am simply working on 10s of millions per hour.  Enought to reasonably afford to lose a good ship and not have to spend months earning the cash to get it back.  Also, i will edit that, thank you.
---
the guy you were talking to talked about "swarming" the carriers, he never mentioned jamming the ship directly with the ec's and not the fighters. now someone who is even remotely familiar with the topic would assume the most obvious meaning in that regard: jamming the fighters. I'm not reading your post like i want, i'm just about 99% sure you misunderstood the dude.
---
What ccp givith ccp can just as easily takith. 
---
1. ccp gave you citadels to increase your safety
---
2. ccp gave you endless anoms to increase your income
---
3. ccp buffed supers to apply better to subs 
---
4. ccp buffed titans to apply better to subs and gave back area dd. 
---
5. ccp gave you fatigue less jb's
---
These are all within the past 5 years. They can all be undone and adjusted as with any other game when the developer realizes they fucked up.
---
Just thinking out loud here, but wouldn't a specialized cyno ship fix this problem also? Or maybe make the cyno module subcap only?
---

Proteus is the best pod killer. That’s it. It sucks donkey dicks for anything else.
---
That was a lot of words but the main idea is missing: do you agree that 0.0-sec is a space controlled by players and they should play as they want? Or do you think that developers should set up rules of what players should do there and how they should play?
---
only if you put every third party with panfam &amp; friends which would be inaccurate. and \*\*even\*\* then it still was only one fight, entity wise the Imperium still easily outnumbered their enemies.
---
Yeppers
---
So there is a role for jams after all!
---
Eve is far from perfect. But if you expect a game you can play carelessly, it's not it. And that's what makes it appealing really for the people who stick around and keep playing.
---
There's a reason i used that word specifically. You can play casually just fine (i do from time to time and i've made billions as an alpha clone), but you can't play carelessly without something bad happening sooner or later.
---
Your fault was not being casual, it was being impatient and deciding to go through a hot zone in one of the main ships you use, instead of scouting it out with a shuttle (which is dirt-cheap and you could have afforded to lose).
---
Cyno ships are already stuck on grid, I think that's fine. The spool up is necessary though.
---
Its an NIP not blueing test hunts in our space we hunrlt in yours
---
Can fly Tengu and Proteus. Legion next someday in the future. But never a Loki just because it's the only ugly one out of the bunch.
---
That's a lot of tits... I am jealous. I have to flash thousands at a strip club to get that
---
Buffer gilas can run any site up to T3 comfortably and T4 exotics comfortably. Anything else has risk associated with them. Unfortunately not a lot of risk in flying an 80k ehp buffer ship in highsec :/.
---
Developers have been doing that for the entire game (not just nullsec) since forever. They make the game mechanics, players use them. The player's choice is how to use the mechanics, not what mechanics get implemented. Sure, we can discuss, propose and advocate certain things (like we do now), but in the end CCP lays down the rules.
---
A long time ago, CCP said that sov works this way, then said it works another way. Then they changed a bunch of ships, then they changed some others and so on. Players just use what they are given. They don't make the rules of the game, they make the rules of their group within the frame of what the game permits them to do.
---
And Permanent, and there was no nullification.  
---
This is also argued to be the 'eve glory days' funny that.
---
Faction warfare space is a good place to start. Plex mechanics make it so that you can somewhat predict the initial range at which the fight starts, plus it's relatively easy to locate fights (just d-scan the plexes and check which ones have ships you're ok with engaging).
---
For a basic idea of the FW frigate rock-paper-scissors meta and an overview of how frigates are flown, check out the guide https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ahwsef/novice_frigates_yearbook_2019/.
---
My recommendation is to fly some T1 frigates and destroyers to start out. Cruisers are also not a bad idea, insurance on T1 cruisers is really good. The advantage to frigates and destroyers is that they're fast moving and eminently engageable, so it's easy to move through lowsec you'll find a lot of fights. Cruisers are slightly slower so you occasionally run into the possibility of being caught on a gate, though barring a dedicated gatecamp this is usually not a problem as long as you understand gate mechanics. The nice thing about cruisers is that they have a substantially larger starting EHP pool, which means fights last longer and you have a bit more time to react to changes. With frigate and destroyer PvP, a fight is often decided within a few seconds due to the low EHP. (Destroyers don't have that much more tank than frigates. They have slightly more base EHP but usually can't increase their tank by too much because they don't have that many low and mid slots and need to devote fitting room to max out their number of guns.)
---
For frigates some good ships to start out with are:
---
1. Tormentor. Can fit both beam and pulse. Usually wants to scram-kite. Very good dps and can fight at many distances due to the range of lasers and the ability to quickly swap ammo. Main problem to dance around is that it has some capacitor issues.
---
2. Incursus/Merlin. Incursus is an brawler, can also try scram kiting with rails. Probably the best ship at 0km. One of the strongest tanks due to its armor rep bonus, good ship for practicing how to optimally use a SAAR. Merlin is quite similar, a tanky ship that hits exceptionally hard at 0km. Slightly slower at base, though Incursus will usually penalize its speed with armor rigs so it even out. Merlin tends to have fewer capacitor issues because it typically shield tanks. For lols, try fitting dual web and no scram, load Void, and scare people with ridiculous DPS for a T1 frigate (works for both ships).
---
3. Breacher. Mostly fit with rockets. Excellent tank with the rep bonus. Somewhat flexible in terms of fits, people do all sorts of stuff (dual shield/armor rep, dual shield rep, cap stable shield rep, etc). Good base speed because it's a Minmatar ship. Rockets let you fight anywhere in scram range and allow for choosing damage type. Usually doesn't have severe cap issues.
---
4. Tristan. The most flexible frigate. Can kite, brawl, and scram-kite with equal viability. Might use turrets, might use neuts, might put nothing in the high slots. Might tank with shield buffer, or armor tank, or hull tank, or fit nanos and speed/range tank. It's pretty much impossible to predict how a Tristan is fit unless you're on grid with it.
---
For destroyers I suggest:
---
1. Thrasher. Both AC and artillery fits work. Make use of the good falloff on projectiles. Has some flexibility with the mids, especially pertaining to the choice of prop mod. Shreds most frigates.
---
2. Coercer. Does suffer from only having 2 mids. A decent strategy is to go dual web with no prop mod, and blap your opponent within the first few seconds of the fight. A Coercer that has set up shop within a plex is very dangerous. Again, lasers allow you to fight at lots of ranges.
---
3. Algos. Much like the Tristan, can fight at any range and has a significant amount of flexibility in fitting.
---
Later on you can upgrade to faction frigates.
---
proteus
---
it seems you have it backwards- oversized ab is a novelty and mwd is the de facto prop mod in nullsec. it's basically what lets you keep up with others on grid. assault ships get to exploit the sig bonus, but they would use it either way. i dont think assault frigates lend themselves to 10mn, i tried to make a 10mn wolf work but it's not particularly great, maybe in more skilled hands.
---
some ships will have competitive oversized ab fits and you'll know when you see them, jackdaw, confessor and thrasher are examples.
---
F
---
Nah i scouted with my scout ship.  I can afford to replace it, but i dont think i am being unreasonable by pointing out that one of the fastest builds in the game cant even react in high sec by simply traveling to a warp gate.
---
I was on autopilot.  Id made a mistake.  My issue is that invasions last hours.  I wanted to do low stress distro missions on a saturday, but just realized that this has been removed from the game.  The thought of not being able to play a game because i have to wait hours for an invasion to stop seems like a bad mechanic and not fun to me.
---
Write a script that replaces all capital ships with rooke ships during downtime, then delete capitals. Problem solved.
---
It does in my world.
---
Make rorqs cost about as much as a dread, give them turrets and cap miners that make them stationary with each one minute cycle and mine for close to what they get today.
---
Reduce their tank accordingly. If they died about as quick as a carrier, the window of opportunity to kill them might be longer than the time for umbrella response. This won't always work (and it shouldn't) but you'll see more of them die.
---
There's a problem with your subcaps for home defense idea. The hunters are almost always in ships that can moon walk away from a response fleet. Harpy fleet shows? Just cloak and get to the next target. Caps can jump right in and at least kill a few attackers.
---
The skill cap on alpha clones is also an issue for me, as i cant skill up to try to keep pace.  I shouldnt have to pay for a game that i am not playing, so that i can get more mastery so that i can survive long enough to buy ship parts to play the game with.  I like working hard in games, but this seems rigged for hardcore players, or rich casuals, which i am not.
---
No, he says: Delete capitals.
---
Was expecting a Provi BR...
---
Wow the eve Reddit community is toxic. 
---
You’ve misunderstood the fundamental point of my post. Try again
---
Defenceless things should be escorted by gangs of combat ships. Content. Wake up
---
&gt; For example an ECMed ship could have longer lock times 
---
damps already do this
---
Just move to a different constellation until it goes away. Crazy huge map and you're unsubbing because a tiny tiny piece of it is a pain in the ass for a little while? Are you for real?
---
RIP i just wrote my AAR and its blocked cause my toon is too new it seems...
---
my problem is when the first site is a WIN so i spend the rest of the day going for the next big payout only to go dry.
---
Do I know you?
---
I'm confused, this is titled "Blackout", yet everything but 1 kill has local enabled in it ??
---
&gt; Would we though?
---
I doubt it. The train is terrible and the ship is niche so I bet a lot of people would have stuck to other methods. I remember rorqs being quite rare.
---
Injectors broke pretty much everything and they were all about appeasing the people who didn't want to wait over a year for a cap ship. Now people are crying to dump skills altogether and make all characters basically the same.
---
I have no issue with it being better, don't really care about that and I personally think it would be stupid to advocate that a multibillion isk ship should be worse than a 250m exhumer in some way. The only problem I have with the ship is that people use 20 of them at a time making it way to easy to get space rich.
---
But you are still playing even when not logged in. Your skill queue keeps running, the market orders you put up are still buying and selling, your PI is still being collected and the list goes on. It's a subscription. Just because you subscribe to a newspaper service and you don't read one release it doesn't mean you can get your money back......
---
Secondly: if you were the FC, shouldn’t you have been aware of saving him? No fax on standby? Are you always this trash?
---
You can easily counter bumping by purchasing mining permit and obeying the Code.
---
&gt; You mean CCP changed the meta by removing passive moons
---
That change was a good one, IMO. if it was done right, you'd have more targets on moons (which we do) that can be killed (which they largely can't) before help arrives. Fix the ships and the moons provide you opportunity.
---
You do know this thread is two months old, right?
---
the popularity of halo sets is directly caused by snakes being better at pretty much every single situation, not about a sig bonus being bad or underpowered.
---
has it occured to you that those pictures are covering up certain things on the stream and not ego at all?
---
Longer lock times is something that damps do already, which adds to their flexibility: if they run into a brawling situation they can load scan res scripts and mess with the logi that way.
---
I don't agree that ECM needs a rework that makes it viable in most scenarios. In fact, the only ewar that have that property are damps and tackle. Weapons disruptors are not universally viable because you have to choose between being able to disrupt turrets and missiles and do nothing to drones. Target painters are not universally viable because they're irrelevant in fleets using smaller weapons systems.
---
My contention is that ECM just needs a role that, while not necessarily universal, is sufficiently common for it to warrant a consistent level of use. Spitballing the suggestion of reducing the effectiveness of remote assistance was based on that idea: the need to break past logi reps is a sufficiently common scenario so that ECM will be useful in many situations, while giving it certain use cases where it performs better or worse at that role compared to damps.
---
Module and ship design in EVE has always revolved around the philosophy that it's better to be good at one thing rather than ok at everything. That principle should apply to all ewar. There's no need for ECM to be useful all the time; it just needs to have a somewhat common use case where it's the best option, along with a way to effectively counter it. This makes choosing to fly ECM an interactive process: instead of automatically going "hey let's fly ECM because it's always super useful," you need to think about your opponent's likely fleet composition to decide if ECM is the right ewar to bring along. In fact, I'd even suggest that based on this principle, damps might be a little too strong right now.
---
you got flair baited buddy
---
Bombers Bar are literally irreverent
---
Undocking in eve is consent for PvP, so dont't undock, better yet, don't log in.
---
&gt; It hurts the little guy
---
Not really. Little guys (I'm one) can mine in a porp/barge fleet. Sure the isk/hr isn't as good but the isk risk a fraction of a rorq. I finally got my porpoise killed today and my 75Mil loss was literally replaced in minutes ans I came || this close to killing one of them. If I'd had a point, I'd have been isk positive.
---
Yes, and invasions are all over.  The issue is that id spent what to me is a lot of money on a part, unwittingly bought it in invasion space and wanted to play today.  Is there a way to tell if where you are buying something inside invasion space?  Im not aware of one, and i dont think group raids are a good idea in the newbie areas.  
---
Also, just going to a different area is what i was trying to do.
---
Word, triglav ships are beautiful
---
Take this feeling times 100 and you're starting to understand WH space...
---
yeah but they can still take reps, right?
---
I don’t think that a “fight” has any greater chance of escalating due to the black out, I think the feeding of ships to save someone has increased. The fights have been happening before blackout, they haven’t increased only the amount of people talking about the battles have.  I think the test has given people a “reason” to try hunting, fleets, roams which is good.  What I really think CCP is trying is cultivating a change to any risk adverse mentality. 
---
I log on, intel channel is buzzing crazy, let’s see how many jumps from me.  Nope only 5 or so away, guess I’ll go play a different game. 
---
I myself am guilty of doing this, so with the test of blackout I think it’s good from that perspective.  
---
On your recommendation of sovereignty holding some sort of perk or tactical advance, yes, yes and more yes.  I could say “bring back R64 moons” however I’d rather say give us more things like that to fucking kill each other over.  
---
Maybe I need a little help understanding a sandbox but, shouldn’t the player base help facilitate gameplay as well?  It’s a collective action in my opinion.
---
I think as I re read your post as I’m writing this you hit the nail on the head with the most organized forces piece.  Do you not think those pilots with carriers, super carriers, titans are risk adverse?  The umbrellas that are in place still take someone willing to jump 2 billion to 80 billion worth of a ship to someone in need.  At each stage of progression with capitals I still felt the nervous shakes before jumping.   This didn’t matter if I was in a dread to my titan.

Your last part stating removing super capitals from eve, i don’t have any other way of putting this that doesn’t sound antagonizing so do you own these ships? I ask because for me it’s a milestone, it’s something I think many strive to achieve but don’t always make.  It’s a staple of achievement in your corporation, in your alliance.  It’s that end game feeling and many would say “ I have a titan, I’ve won EVE.”  The skill training program has to have a carrot on a stick, there has to be a goal or there is an incentive to keep grinding that SP.  The wrong turn CCP took was allowing a new player to skill inject to end game content, that’s a fucking pay to win button.  It’ll cost you but god damn that shouldn’t have been a option.  
---
One of my fellow pilots is a newer player, within the last 3 years.  He injected to catch up, eventually even into an titan.  Call me salty sure, but that should be something that you have to wait for.  Something that will take your time and patience to get.  A level of appreciation not only for grinding for the ship but the skill points to use effectively. Giving every Tom, Dick and Jane the instant I win button isn’t right.  You want a titan pilot? Buy it off the character bazaar and let people purchase name changes.  Don’t give them a pay to win model.   
---
My rant there, apologies.
---
Nah. It really isn't THAT bad. It's as likely to catch retards in t1 haulers full of pi stuff as slow down PVPers. And you can shoot then to draw out defenders.

what does the chart mean? is it volume? It can't be historical price if it's hockey sticking like this but it's still 0.00%
---
The idea should be [this](https://i.imgur.com/KYexHVP.jpg) and not [this](https://i.imgur.com/mAQRBFh.jpg).

Maybe the total logins is down, but I'm sure its - - - krabs/bots and ++ actual content generators (i.e. real players, interacting with other real players, rather than a bot with some spod)
---
That is not playing a game.  Also, i dont want my money back.  I wanted to raise an issue i saw, granted i was frustrated at the time id written the initial post.  I still feel like ccp has taken the way i like to play and cut it from the game.  Just one of my ossues is a hurdle.  All of them combined makes the game impossible.
---
bit of an exaggeration. but i mean... sleeper loot tougher to get right? D:
---
Have you a fitting you can share? That sounds like super fun.
---
faxes were on standby titan cyno was delayed cause he paniced and had ozone in a container in his cargohold
---
I believe they are tracked in the Agency. Chin up man, it's natural to feel like the game isn't fair (it isn't)
---
Bombers Bar - spending 40 hours sitting on a blops for 2 minutes of clips
---
Nah, Proteus has its flaws, but it also has some great bonuses... It needs some tweaks to it's fitting and then it's viable again... What can you even do to fix the GNI??
---
well get to it then!
---
200s tend to use more pg/cpu and not offer that much more dps over 150's.
---
On ships where you can take 200s without sacrificing heavily for it, they are good; they are even better if that ship has a tracking bonus.
---
A perfect example of this is the firetail, which has a tracking bonus, and other things that make it just work perfectly with 200's.
---
Otoh, Rifter has issues with the 200's as it has no tracking bonus to work well up close, and at range, it needs them because of the extra falloff ... despite the fact that it has issues fitting them overall. :(
---
A cloaky tengu probably.
---
Blackout has me *this close* to re-subbing. If only real life would let me have the time to play.
---
Nicely done! Make sure to share it once more if you end up painting it!
---
Your probes are 20m a pop, no.
---
Probe, core probe launcher, core probes, 5mn mwd, relic and data scanner, emission scope sharpener rig, i-stabs in low. Flavor with probe mods, drones, whatever.
---
It’s under 2m, T1 setups can be under 900k, what are you fitting?
---
You need to lookup what sites are safe, learn to use bookmarks and dscan.
---
Making the cyno subcap only plus a spool up time. Also allow the cyno to be shut off by jams? 
---
You'd effectively bring a lot of counterplay to dropping on big toys and maybe being able to squirrel a kill before the slow beasts land and pummel you. 
---
Imagine. 
---
You're ratting in your Nyx. Shit you're tackled. Warp in your cyno subcap. Blackbird jams it. Cyno goes down. Can't jump your FAX alt in. Now depending on where you're at. Help can maybe jump to the Beacon in system. That means you have the align and warp time of FAX, caps, supers, and titans to kill the nyx before they arrive. Unless the gang that tackled you brought a dictor or two and they've already bubbled the Beacon and the safe cyno on the keepstar.
---
you gotta make up your mind, are they third party or are they just shooting the azbel?. I know chinese may have some cultural differences but i doubt one of the is an undying wish to bash random people's structures.
---
You totally lost me.
---
A probe is like 300k in my current zone and when decked up probably runs me around 1 million when all said and done.
---
So where you getting the 20m math?
---
I love reading new player stories, escpecially explorers.  
---
So I recently created an alpha heron account to see what it is like to be an alpha explorer (my normal play mode as an omega is hunting whatever I find in wormholes).  Splashing c1-c3 wormholes in high sec such a favorable risk vs. reward. I just make sure I am far away from trade hubs when I am scanning for holes.  My first site was a crappy data site that paid for my next 12 herons.  
---
With my 5 mid-slots I fit 2 sensor boosters with eccm scripts and it makes me very hard to be combat probed at my safe spots (thanks Jonny Splunk).  With that an burning toward dead space while scanning, I haven't been probed yet.  I'm at about 200 mil without losing a ship yet (which would pay for my current fit about 430 times over).  I got jumped once at a site but had the sun preselected and immediately warped off.  
---
I guess my point is, make sure you are efficient with scanning (watch some videos if you havent, most people can be twice as fast if they understood the mechanics a little better), always scan from a safe and burn into dead space (in the direction of nothing warpable), DScan all the time, hack in c1-3 wormholes far from Amarr and Jita, and have a celestial pre-selected while hacking to be ready for a quick escape.  You will start raking in isk in no time.
---
Cloak really doesn't need any kind of nerfing.
---
Intresting i will look into it in the future when i need a tristen fix again :) will let you know about the skins cheers when i get round to it.
---
I've been out solo hunting for the first time in months, and have scored kills solo for the first time in a long long time
---
This seems like an unpopular opinion here but, this is their space and it’s a sand box. If they want it super bubbled then that’s their choice. If you want to clear the bubbles instead of just burning through them, then that’s your choice as well.
---
AHAHAHAHA holy shit I can't stop laughing at that gif
---
Yea, they are, i hadnt thought to check zone names around the area before buying something on the market.  I also had lost everything since this xpac.  I dont mind picking myself back up, but its not feasable without what would be a large time investment, and i cannot afford that at the moment without getting something in return.  I want to earn my ships back and have been stopped from doing so.  I only see this problem happening again and again to where it becomes a vicous cycle.  
---
Without the ability to freely travel through high sec the game has changed in a way i cannot play, and the way to correct that costs money and time, and i wont pay for a game just to skill up when a single point for me takes weeks.  I might get 4 or 5 skills from 3 to 4 for $15, which means im approximately $60 from any l4 mastery and thats if i can play without loss long enough to afford a decent ship at this point, plus the current missions=cash meta forces you in to invasion space.
---
I have had two Avatars since roughly 2014.
---
It's funny cause cynos are probably going to be delayed based on current eve patch trends. They're specifically targeting this kind of gameplay since Hilmars divine promise.
---
I’m sorry, you FOUND 80m, and the end wasn’t sarcastic, lol.
---
I thought you where saying you LOST 80 over the few deaths.
---
Good job persevering!
---
that is why i asked, i didn't want to make any assumptions lol.
---
&gt;Can we please turn off the isk faucet that is L4's?
---
That's so 2011. L4s have been shit isk for a long time compared to highsec incursions, exploration, abyssals (guessing here I've no experience with them).
---
Subcap pilots are the only people who are really suffering from Local Null Black Out; the newbros who have been investing slowly to the game and who immediately went to Null.
---
Yes.
---
&gt;Putting boosts on a Titan
---
Meh, you've gave yourself an accurate assessment already no need to slice the wound further
---
Imagine using 2b Loki for almost same ticks as 500m Loki
---
bubbles should have reinforcement timers /s
---
Subscription is paying for a service. Whether you use the available service or not is a personal choice.
---
hi! 
---
To long point 2 stabbers, you need to be faster than their drones, keep point on a stabber and dodge the other stabber’s optimal with help of a TD and some manual range manipulation. So not just speed can do this.
---
yeah my T2 were in cargo dragged the wrong ones... Why can you comment btw? I was told this is hidden and no one can see it because my account was not old enough to post!
---
That and no more standings loss for attacking someone who is in the NPC corp of fw.
---
It would be good if it wasn't yet another kick in the teeth to every playstyle except sov null. Some of us don't want to krab all day to play the game, but CCP is gradually making every other option unrewarding.
