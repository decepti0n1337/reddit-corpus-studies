fit shield tank on it

Stability in logistics, is the area they live in good for pvp and income. Do i have to do pap links? Does my presence matter or am i just a number/sheep. Try trying small/medium corp/alliance where your presence can actually make a difference a place where your not just a f1 monkey where u might need to self pilot.
---
Eve has literally lost all of its flavor without AT.
---
You guys were way better. Good job.

rocketx made a good video about the drone damage exploit: https://youtu.be/z1FH06MqNxA

---
He didnt pretend nor implied anything along those lines?
---
For a very limited time yes, but after that no you really want omega.
---
remember that time you were getting evicted and some of those people had to save you.....
---
I figured it would be something along those lines. But I assumed you werent dumb enough to think that unnecessary complexity is something good. Too many on this forum somehow think a game is more hardcore if its so stupidly over the top complex so few play it.
---
I can't answer your question, and I'm no authority of drops rates, site types or rat faction differences.
---

---
But I can say that I've done a lot of Serpentis HS combat sites over the last 2-3 months or so, and I've gotten a single Daredevil bpc. So I assume that you got very lucky and I'd be surprised if you saw any more anytime soon. I have read something about this but I can't remember. A guess could be something like 1 in 1-10k for one bpc maybe?
---
I was in P-Town on Cape Cod one time for a vacatation. Turns out it was Bear Week and let me tell you - the amount of gigantic hairy men  riding around on single speeds was legendary. It was a \*revelation\*.
---
It's easier to grind for omega once you become omega. So it's always recommended to pay for your first omega with rl iskies. 
---
Having said that if you have a lot of free time then you can earn omega as an alpha by exploration, wormhole gas huffing, and mining R64 moons.
---
I love your videos, keep them up!
---
It's a Titan DD, not a Keepstar module

Whos feeding who? Kek
---
There were NPC buy orders for them during the event. But apart from that, they are junk.
---
This was almost never true of Caldari Militia groups in my experience, but there were a few exceptions. PYRE, in its time in CalMil, were very good small gang pilots. We definitely had to rely on numbers to evict them from Enaluri, but we fought on even terms many many times and won.
---
Until FedUP, I don't recall there ever being a gallente militia outfit that relied on "blob" tactics.  
---
Indeed, gallente militia culture was steeped in using attrition tactics against overwhelming numbers. Most of the old school GalMil groups from my early days (JustK, Moira, QCATS) formed during a period when nullsec blocs on hard times would join Caldari Militia in order to farm isk before returning to null. This happened with eVoke, then TEST, then Brave a few years later. I can't think of a time in the entire history of FW where a massive null group joined GalMil and added a massive numbers advantage to our side.
---
Complimentary screenshot to illegal nullsec operation of Concord https://i.imgur.com/MLZEf9q.png
---
None of you ever recall it when you did it either.. it's funny how that works..
---
and no none of those groups formed because of null sec blocs.. whenever the null sec blocs came in.. they stayed for a month at most and farmed like crazy then ran off to do what they did and put their alts in Gal Mil to farm back the other side..
---
The lore in this game is a complete mess.
---
Triglavian ships have unnaturally weak shields (but thick armor) compared to... pretty much every other faction in the game. Their shields will regenerate very slowly, but in most cases you shouldn't be concerned about this fact because in most cases their defenses will be focused on their armor.
---
So while you can get around this by fitting Shield Extenders in the mid slots, Power Diagnostics or Shield Power Relays in the low slots, and Extender or Purger Rigs, you *really* shouldn't worry about this specific weakness of that ship because you can use the ship more efficiently and effectively in other ways. (i.e., make the Armor stronger.)
---
Yeah, I'm cool with that. I don't care about losing my ship if there's SRP in place, lol. If there isn't, I'll be pissed.
---
In what circumstance do concord illegally operate in null?
---
Wormhole pvp. Deadspace fit T2 or T3 ships, with Faction Fax for support, then everyone jumps through the wormhole when the fight starts to go one direction.
---
Under supercap umbrellas? yeah it is thanks.
---
Looks like good fun! Almost makes me wish I hadn't "won" at Eve. :)  Well done to all, gents!
---
There is an in-game market
---
&gt;There isnt a C4 group that I know of whose currently active who lives in a c4 for that reason.
---
:bigthink:
---
They used to be the absolute best.
---
Back when tracking titans existed.
---
Rogue drones produced minerals. A titan could rat up another titan in less time than a rorqual mines another rorqual.
---
.
---
Shit was crazy
---
Yes. These haven't been changed
---
It's typically derogatorily used to refer to people that do not provide any content to the game, that just farm and never do any PVP.
---
One of the most stupids exploits I found: You know how you can transfer items from one inventory using ctrl-x and ctrl-v? Well I found occasions were ctrl-c would work as well. *Those* got fixed fast when I reported them.
---
You can't jump clone to J-space citadels? o.O
---
Thank you for that information, had been toying with an idea which relied on that being possible. Thank you for informing me on that so I can scrap that plan.
---
I live in a c4. My corp will only drop caps to defend structures from what I understand.
---
Other than that be prepared to fight T2 fit battleships and cruisers more than anything, really. Maybe some leshaks if the other side escalates. 
---
We pvp for the sake of pvp. It's fun. It's why we play eve.
---
To the best of my knowledge, no. This is why hole control is so powerful. Once you've podded someone out to empire during an eviction, if you can control the hole leading back in, they have no way to get in to their own system to defend it.
---
Put back Blackout REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Mind = Considerably blown.
---
Hum... scalability ? Like HS -&gt; LS Massive gap, then LS-&gt; NS ... well not difference at all but the NPC stations...
---
If you are in Therabois with V0lta, than your situation is special and you cannot compare to a lot of smaller C2-groups. You are basically for J-Space what SNUFF was for Lowsec.
---
If you are 10 active people in Subcaps, usually poking a Rorqual makes no sense at all. You need to be able to field 25 Trig DPS + 100MN-Logi vs. Fighters and the occasional Bhaals. In Wormhole Categories this already qualifies you as blob.
---
There was a time when they didn't, and that probably gives rise to people still thinking they don't today.
---
No, consider it a short trial
---
It's A LOT of number crunching, I can only recommand using tools and spreadcheats.
---
Being aware of taxe rates, hauling issues, volumes sold…
---
My favorite tool as a bonushttps://eveiph.github.io/

Well, yes, obviously.

There is no Ishtar/domi hunting fit less than 100m
---
Elo can I sell you another corpse for 5bn before you go?
---
As one of the fiew Zombies that did actualy attack and fight concord then i can tell you why, cause they needed to get boosted after we slaughtered them, simple as that.
---
THE rust
---
We did it to show how dumb it was that remote repairing and energy transfer was while it was not taken as an aggression. Cause earlyer in days you could remote repair and energy transfer a ship and you did not get flagged, that is what we were trying to point out was dumb, and so we did.
---
If anybody hadn't noticed, but FXR and Banderlogs are technically full INIT.Pets since a while now. INIT even planted a Keepstar in FXR space which now represents the northern beachhead for the ansiblex network and the projection of the INIT/Imperium SCap-Forces ....
---
This isn’t the time to be a spodbrain dude...

What a horrible fit.

We can outform you in caps in EU TZ. That's no secret. The fact that you claim otherwise makes you "super spai" claim a little doubtful.
---
Also, just FYI, we know you guys have spais in our groups, as I'm sure you guys know we have spais in yours. We've been at this for almost 2 years now, it would be kind of weird if we didn't.

For Branch/Deklein i used the following Ishkur fit:

&amp;#x200B;
---
Its sufficent for most of your list, dominixes can be tricky since the dps is basically on the edge to break it, but then normally waiting for some more npc can help. 
---
If you grind them too long most botters start to fit stabs, thats why i generally put depot+additional scram in cargo. Often i have also refit, probes, some extra drones with me.
---
Its (probably) the cheapest solution, best in terms of isk/efficiency is probably a magus (for branch/deklein/other ki/th based botting regions).
---
Yea I was talking about the us timezone and I ment I personally have spy characters so I have heard the propaganda and spin your li e members are fed fire fly myself
---
yeah this was long before the safety was implemented. the good ol' days (around 2008-2009 I think). when they relaunched the snowballs the next year, they modified it so it wouldn't show you as aggressing anymore
---
Stay strong and welcome to Toronto its a great city. Hopefully you get settled in and come back soon.
---
o7 elo, life gets better. you'll get better. fly safe!
---
[removed]
---
Funnyenough I just rewatched the phoenus vindication series from early early eve when battleship roaming meant good fights. 
---
I hate seeing alliances like this close up.
---
Okay but this fails to explain how I can only fill up a storage unit/launchpad to maximum-1 but then go back the very next day and add the final one.
---
The calculation isn’t randomly changing day to day. The calculation isn’t fluid.
---
Like I literally have a screenshot of the launch pad in my post filled to the maximum-2 and a screen shot that I took the next day after I was able to put the final one in there.
---
Expect minerals to drop in price. No one likes grinding more than the Koreans, except maybe the chinese
---
Your post seems to have negative connotation. I it does, what's so bad about it?
---
They are indeed a group of disgruntled ex-Provi dudes. Their leader likes to pin people down and tell them at great lengths how CVA touched him funny when he was a young newb. He's the source of a lot of their funniest propaganda.
---
HTP used to keep them around as amusing pets. Used them to HQ tank H6 (closest system to Provi staging) and to provide a bit of buffer to their own systems. 
---
They originally rented some systems and moons from HTP. I'm not sure about systems, but they still rent moons. They've kind of become the krabber/ADM maintenance wing of RC, and do most of the grunt-work to keep the non-HQ tanked systems firmly in the US TZ.
---
Those Kr players have Big Deadspace Energy
---
Fly safe mate o7
---
Who TF is MC?? lol
---
You need Thermodynamics 1 to unlock heating your modules.
---
You need Nanite skill to use Nanite Repairpaste to actively repair them in space.
---
Most basic skills also benefit shiptypes of a higher class... some basic skill you might just want to train for conveniece are actually required to fly specialized T2 ships.
---
Buyers market
---
Plenty of heaters ahead dood.
---
Have any links to some of other discords?
---
Why low though, it's basically the worse place for krabbing because of the high risk and only medium reward.
---
Why would they need a nerf? They are fine
---
o7 buddy feel better
---
Cynabois feasting this season
---
I've used a version of this, too. It's solid. You can also do a single-prop w/plate so you have more buffer and can annoy ratting carriers, but I think I prefer this one.
---
It doesn't matter, as longas the vocal minority on Twitter continue to act the way they have and are still acting, it will put people off. Same as the mods of this sub reddit allowing toxic comments to stay on posts and encouraging it.
---
Eve Online is in the process of revamping its image and its doing a fine job. But the community itself needs to step up and stop projecting a "toxic" vibe on social media. 
---
No doubt the haters will downvote the crap out of this comment but when they do, it will simply prove my point.
---
Thank you, sadly I have 9d left before getting into a Retri :(
---
But I'm training !
---
Raven is a pretty bad ship for emergings. The rattler is a much better choice. Also the drekevac, sleipnir, and pretty much any t3c. Those are the most common i've seen
---
Thanks man!
---
I don't think he has the patience.
---
From FB to Reddit? It must be opposite day.
---
&gt; Why you play EVE if you can have more fun somewhere else without effort? 
---
because other games require effort. for me eve's draw is just how much of the game is fire and forget. skill training, industry, PI etc. spend a few mins setting it up, then it ticks way whether i'm in game or not.
---
I have been away for awhile. What is/was a ramjag?
---
Congrats on focusing on getting better. It isn't easy climbing out of the spiral, but we all know you can do it :) See you soon!
---
If I can turn my Minmatar and Gallente standings into even more of a dumpster fire by helping out Triglavians without messing with Caldari and Amarr standings, then sure.
---
Don't the empires dislike capsuleers in the first place?
---
Angel Cartel is BiS anyway...
---
Count the chins.
---
Gosh
---
They broke the jag by nerfing it? Or you mean when they buffed it and other AFs?
---
Thanks for fleet Elo o7
---
*Quadlavian
---
Is there any reliable site that has ship fits for most play styles?  It's been so long since I've done any actual PVP, and most of my stuff was usually small gang/roam or line member, so I'm not sure what I would need for Solo PVP stuff, notably trying to push back against people that try to push me out of wormholes.
---
&gt;What does this at all have to do with the conversation at hand here?
---
Everytime I read people complain about "people that do not provide any content to the game" I automatically presume they must be one of those leet pvpers.
---
Nobody must contribute to your playstyle.
---
The fact that some regions of space are considered a "Fortress" hints at the fact that many different people don't want to be part of your gameplay.
---
If you ignore that fact and push for PvP shit like *cHaOs eRa* you loose a third of our playerbase and need to face responsibility: Just watch this presentation from Vegas [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLRuKopYNXw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=823](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLRuKopYNXw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=823) where the Dev talked about the failure that was blackout as well as income inequality and the gap that blackout made obvious.
---
*cHaOs eRa* nerfed the little guys, small corps and not the EvE Veterans!
---
You need to keep the PvE in EvE, you need to support different parts of the game.
---
EvE is no "full" PvP game because you can undock and it might take years or months until you loose your ship the first time. Its not comparable to CS:GO or LoL for example wich are clearly ment for direct conflict. In EvE there is PvP enabled at all times and you can get ganked sure, but that does not mean you want to be ganked or contribute to PvP gameplay/content.
---
I know thats hard for *'muh elite pvpers* to grasp--
---
Its legit to ditch PvP alltogether and only focus on PvE, mining, PI, salvaging, reactions, inventions, production etc. - you can do so many things in EvE why choose to do PvP?
---
I mean if those where jamgu's you where basically 1 cycle on a leshak away from well dead.
---
But wouldn´t then the max life time of the longest living wh make more sense? Or is it actually 48 hours long?
---
Mine is/was "Friendly Local Cyno," and he lived up to his name; I only ever used it for industry boats or blops travelling.
---
Oh, I see - I thought you were complaining that the houses were cheap, which made no sense to me. $500k isn't cheap.
---
True, i forgot about the t1 phoon. Explo velocity is pretty weak (grappler negates its usefulness), but is still an application bonus i suppose.
---
Even if you have 20 rorquals, your production is a drop in the bucket for major alliances. Anywhere where there is a functioning alliance with a capital umbrella will have a decent market for selling minerals. Theyre always in demand
---
oh ya, that's the other bonus, Drones drop all types of salvage so you make more money off of salvaging sites in drone lands.   
---
Also, Drone sites are a bit easier to run for newer players because drones don't have ECM, painters, jammers, etc like other pirates do.
---
DM me the system and location and I'll see if my guys want to make the trek over to high sec.
---
pay for your trip yourself next time
---
CCP fucked up the moment they relied completely on players to create content, drive engagements and movement in space. Anything as a result of that is to be expected.
---
Do you lose standings for attacking players of the opposite faction while enlisted? I know you do for NPCs
---
This is an example of buying into the system, you're told when there's war time and peace time. 
---
I'll give you an example: I don't have peace mode and war mode, I'm just always looking for a fight, I guess I'm a pirate or raider or whatever you want to call it. Yeah I krab to make some isk, but its to buy some ships and get out there with my buddies and do some damage. It's not always about leading a huge 1000 vs 1000 battle, it could be you and 5 buddies roaming around hunting, or locking systems down with gatecamps, or whatever. 
---
My point is that too many people look at the political narrative of things, and thats boring, you litterally end up paying a subscription to impress others, that sounds not fun at all. Warlording can be done at any size/scale, and if you get kicked from your garbage tier alliance, that's good, as now you have nothing to hold you back from warlording.
---
remove triglodyte
---
Trig ships are the strongest sub caps in the game. Two Leshaks is incredibly strong against that fleet, especially spider tanking as they are.
---
How cute and quirky you are.
---
Grrrrrr
---
yeah, I imagine a vindi would do that. Thx for the tip. I may unbox my tengu, hoping the new event will allow them
---
o7 MC, miss you nerds ❤️
---
Is the counter to just not give them a fight unless you have same ship type or more?
