He was in lowsec too, I assumed it was a suicide gank at first... I bet the guys that killed him just saw a random Iteron Mark V on a gate and killed it because they could, not realizing until they opened the wreck...

Heed my words, it's 3/3/4

How much isk for one trust?
---
Ah yes, renting with goons. Only a 500mil fee for an over 9000% chance of getting scammed. Seems legit.
---
I admit, I'm not sure how Drust's issue has anything other than is going on in Pator:
---

---
&gt; Even now a capsuleer madman **is attempting to provoke an incident in Pator and these meddlers in ARC, LUMEN and other capsuleer groups** are essentially aiding and abetting him. 
---
Now, I can't speak for ARC, but Lumen literally hasn't been involved with the incident in Pator - so I don't see how we're aiding and abetting in any fashion?
---

---
&gt; On CONCORD and its mission
---
That's fair. If I can explain a little, it feels like there's "no right choice" when it comes to CONCORD. They rabble whatever we do (including, apparently, nothing at all), only giving vague implications of threats and no sense of what/why they are so upset or what we can do about it.
---
I realize I'm just one voice and you probably get story suggestions all the time, but if you want to move CONCORD to a more rationale position, two options seem available to me:
---
- Write in some explicit *~bad things~* happening on account of those foolish capsuleers messing with things they don't understand, so CONCORD's position seems credible.
---
- Provide a means for players to positively engage with CONCORD in some fashion, so it feels like we have an option other than "be their enemies".

We got srp for the vendettas we dropped to tackle supers in X47 so... hi?

It wasn't you for once, how does this make you feel?

In b4 goon scammed me and blew up all my freighters, post #45019.
---
Not a fan boy at all, just pointing out the fact that if someone were really as horrible as the folks in this subreddit would have you believe, Eve would have shuttered its doors within 3 years.
---
Doh! My bad, missed the username lol. Oops.
---
Hey no cargo expanders, what could go wrong?

Yeah it's just harder. If you misclick nothing happens compared to misclicking in space
---
he was safe, he had 2 warp stabs...
---
CCP will actually have to fix citadels to do that
---
I mean... still better defense that the north offers
---
Yeah I gotta admit the last time I saw that kind of dickpunching was before citadels.
---
You're focusing on one time and place. Drust isn't. The context is that entire paragraph of news and everything it refers to.  
---
CONCORD are tricky both because of their lore and also their unique role in EVE mechanics but as I say, we can think about how to ameliorate those factors.
---
Just don't pick Civire. You will never look under 40

You were probably told you weren't skilled enough to join *their corporation*, not that you weren't skilled enough for nullsec.

You've clearly never looked into what its like being a goon line member...I have made money on every single ship I have lost pvping due to SRP since returning to game and joining goons. That alone makes it worth it, but then you get to add in that the infrastructure built up by the alliance making piles of money allows for the price of subs, caps and supers to be lower here than anywhere else, leading to large fleets of big things with guns keeping the reds away so I can more or less print isk with what time I have to rat which goes farther in delve than anywhere else do to the previously mentioned lower ship prices.
---

Ok,  since you've clearly never looked  into what its actually like being a goon line member...I have made money on every  single ship I have lost pvping due to SRP since returning to game and  joining goons. That alone makes it worth it, but then you get to add in  that the infrastructure built up due to the alliance making piles of money  allows for the price of subs, caps and supers to be lower here than  anywhere else, leading to large fleets of big things with guns keeping  the reds away so I can more or less print isk with what time I have to  rat which goes farther in delve than anywhere else do to the previously mentioned lower ship prices. Also due to the large numbers of ratters and site runners the faction mods down here are cheaper than just about anywhere else in game, so you can even shiny fit you shit for less.

" There's a reason why your required to be on a set amount of fleets a month. They need numbers, and your just a number. " That's more about cutting the dead weight that doesn't want to contribute out than anything else.

Click target once, then spam ctrl key...problem solved.
---
Great post!
---
I'm not even a bittervet but I've been around long enough to know they won't do anything with them, ever. EVE is CCPs one trick pony at this point, it sucks to say but you have to admit it. Eve is the only successful product they've still got and the only thing that came close to mixing that up was in VR. 
---
Hell half the tech they promise is going to help Eve never gets implemented. Believing that CCP can do anything other than keep Eve running is a fools errand.
---
It makes me really sad too, because some of the game ideas and concepts are amazing.
---
I disagree but I appreciate your compliment!
---
What's the fun in farming kills from people who have shown several times they don't even have the skill required to fight back? The spire lost all Ihubs in record time even with them trying to contest the timers. The only things they held onto were fights were NC and horde dropped everything to contest the fight.
---
Appears to have been written by a bot.
---
ditto.  citadels are to...accessable.  need limitation and faster to kill.

I don't bot in r/eve, only in r/osrs

How did manage to become the landlord of period basin in the first place?
---
There are originally 7 landlords of Period Basis. But in the end there can be only one.

It‚Äôs because eve is so dead that no one even complains about how dead it is anymore
---
Was expecting another prime NazAlGhul post but only got a goon rental advert. :sadface:
---
How do I know that after I pay you, no one else will come up to me and demand rent?
---
I've sold out temporarily but soon I will make more posts. Once my apartment is set up, I shall be playing this and ESO.

That's illegal they can't do that
---
Were we due for another "Eve is dying" post already? I think you might actually be a few days early, bro.
---
Can I have some shoes?
---
Use TEST structures in Perimeter, those are the safest right now.
---
They'd just dump it like they did their other VR offerings due to a lack of demand. I love how they went as far as making and releasing the games before realizing the purchasing population for VR games is as small as it is. Its like CCP doesn't understand how market research works or why you pay someone to do it BEFORE you start a project.
---
I know. I don't actually have anything against CCP making a shooter, it's just a genre I'm into anymore, alas. Feeling old and crusty, I guess.
---
Mine had 18 hours left on insurance and didn't die.

" At Reboot Develop in Croatia, CCP's CEO Hilmar Veigar P√©tursson told the  audience that they will "try and fail and try again. For a few more  years until we crack it. At CCP we keep at it until we figure it out."   
---
Its not that they can't face their failures, they do that just fine, just take a look at the long line of canceled IP they have strewn in their wake. Their true issue is they seem to be completely incapable of learning from their failures and repeatedly make the same mistakes every time they try again. Think of it in terms of Edison working on the light bulb, only this time instead of trying hundreds of different things to make a working light bulb he just keeps using the same piece of string and wondering why test #1000 had the same outcome as test #1.
---
Still a better deal than renting from BOT and paying 10b to be toldto defend your own shit, though.
---
As a newbie i love to spend irl money to buy 500 plex before i even i even start playing this game because grinding isk as an alpha is stupid and painful
---
I thought they skipped the defense fleets part and just went to demanding the rest still be paid on time even though the spire lost all its upgrades?

"or I'll tackle you and the tittyraptors will motorboat your corpse."

Getting scammed is better than renting to you? lol? Not that I'm here to defend bot or renting, but only an idiot "rents" from goons, given their extremely long history of scamming or awoxing their own "renters".
---
Can you point me to some examples of goons scamming and awoxing actual legit renters, and not just scooter mccabe running a recruitment or rental scam?
---
Their rental alliance was/is the greater western co-prosperity sphere.

Ooh how about Expanded Drone Bay lows and Expanded Drone Bandwidth mids?
---
The serpentis one is the i remember the most clearly as being too hard for the prenerf proteus, and Ishtar. even the prenerf tengu struggled on it simply because its difficulty more like a 8/10. Though that does mean that that my memories of it are ~4 years old. 
---
For the 4/10 it is the the jamming that kills you, the missiles always hit and most of it is light missiles. so they do full damage, and since you get jammed you cant clear enemies off the field to lighten the damage. It sucks to try in a non droneboat like the amarr t3c.

Even 250 arties are rarely used.

Let's make a deal.

No.
---
You will never be free of me. This game could shut down for a variety of reasons, from lack of interest to CCP Games trying desperately to make any game other than a PC port of Dust 512 and wasting all their money on those aborted attempts at game development,  but I'll still be here on this subreddit masturbating to the sound of my keyboard as streams of semen paint my light lavendar walls white.

My rule to add if you get into ship pvp. There is no such thing as a fair fight. There is way too many ways and always too many unknowns. But that's a okay! Pvp is the best!
---
So we are share croppers?
---
Got him good
---
LOL, lost the fight man o7
---
check out the drone region AARs rather than the hordling perimeter morale posts
---
yeah like when they steamrolled out of the north when ncpl was still 2 regions away
---
???????
---
It could be worse: we could have EVE Battle Royale instead.
---
Submit a bug report for it. Sounds like you found an issue with the traces.
---
mmm, data porn..........   
---
with that being said, if you're pulling from zkill involved stats, they can be a little bit misleading at times:  
---
\&gt; team A with 30 instantly gibs one ship of team B with 20  
---
\&gt; team B splashes the wormhole, team A follows  
---
\&gt; B gets caught with a few stragglers on the other side  
---
the data would looks like:  
---
\- one battle report with an involved reading 30 versus 1, because team B didnt kill anything  
---
\- another battle report (same groups mind you) shows 30 versus 3 from the second side
---
reddit kta now
---
Imagine being this butthurt over triangles in a video game..
---
LMAO, all your alliance cares about is pap links o7
---
Why are you so dumb?
---
Where a rental alliance replaces Ihubs and loses nothing more than the upgrades that the renters themselves willingly pay for?
---
waiting for papa goon to lead the way to victory
---
&gt;unrestricted access to anomalies in the entire region, to start. Couple that with the active and powerful defenses of the Imperium
---
but you get that for free if you just join the imperium and most places don't require you to do more than 1 fleet a month and you can do that in a frigate most times. Why rent when joining comes with more benefits?
---
Mad gonz mad
---
We will try and fail and try again. For a few more years until the sub money runs out. At CCP we fuck up until our money runs out.

Bot.

how about improving stuff we got right now.  like 180mm autocannons.
---
No, but the API was redone to enable webapps in standard browsers to access your character information.
---
oof
---
And only old school runescape at that.
---
Honestly oldschool runescape is better than Eve.  Are we playing osrs as a corp yet, naz?  I've got a maxed combat account ready to kill some vorkath in like a day, or whenever I complete Dragon Slayer 2.
---
Not a terrible analogy.  It's the same way the alliance makes money off of linemembers, really.  Make it super nice to live in our space, tax us for the convenience (and then re-invest said money to make our space even nicer, rinse, repeat).  Only instead of the entry fee being "fight for us", your entry fee is "pay a billion spacebux once".

good fits with 250s at least *exist*. when have you ever seen 650s or 1200s on anything?
---
artillery doesn't need a 3rd variant, it just needs the smaller size to have a purpose and not suck quite so much.
---
Yes for the drone bay, no for the drone bandwidth. Lemme just fit my gila with 30 medium drones, it's only 300 million dps with perfect application
---
Mods...?
---
P*ndemic Le*ion, they defy the Godemperor Mittani (PBUH)
---
We have no corp rules really, but most of us give the loot to whoever lost a ship and/or whoever got initial tackle. 
---
Some small gang fleets split the loot even between all participants.
---
dam nice pict love it
---
I'm not sure what you're trying to say here. Imperium has  brought supers to your front door multiple times, even killing several keepstars in the process. Are you saying that wasn't a reason to undock your own titans?
---
As much as I hate Caldari scum... This is beautiful!!!!

make him join a null block and vni rat 100 hours a week, barely making more then he losses from afking. that will show him.

you should give it a try.  Put in a few hours a week and do a little reading for quests and you'll have a dope account within 3-5 business years

So much Corpus/Dark Blood stuff. Someone Goon's loot hangar, perhaps?

WTF, CCP.

You said Brisc Rubal would be immediately perma-banned, but he's still loggin' in, hiding in wormhole space.
---
His perma-ban was announced in the Dev blog on 4/8, but as of 4/12, he's still flying.
---
Granted, he's getting repeatedly killed. Nice.

He deserves deletion and no mercy.

180?

Good to see occasional Tapi victory, even a fairly small one like this.

The endless Tapi fleet disasters were getting a bit dull.

With all the changes since I quit I wouldn't even know where to start. Are there even midslot targeting computers anymore?
---
highsec pvp is real pvp
---
we just don't spurge on reddit as much about them.
---
Weird I know
---
Does anyone actually believe this? You can't eve catch the DED hunters in delve yet all these 'counter hunters' are going to purge PB of hunters. Get a grip.
---
Should have been a krab waving... oh well
---
Can‚Äôt believe no one has mentioned ninja looting/salvaging. It‚Äôs not consistent income but you can easily sustain PvP in decent priced ships by looting. It‚Äôs best done on the weekend when there‚Äôs lots of shit dying. Best is when there‚Äôs a big fight and you can loot while the fight is happening (use the map to find hot spots)
---
You can do this on your main with a Sunesis (the only good use for this ship), so there‚Äôs little to no investment required. Also, I find it quite fun personally.
---
one of the renders someone did had it being almost the same size as a keepstar, how awesome would it be to having a roaming deathstar like NPC that could drop into a system and fuck shit up without warning as an event?
---
we catch and kill hunters in delve all the time, its why such a large number of people complain about why delve is too "safe" for krabs.
---
Basically make a new alt. stick them in eve uni and brave newbies.
---
Never trade, evemail nor put in the same corp as your mains.
---
Thats basicly it M8
---
Just call them nerds.
---
Light the cyno:
---
Search your deck for any ship cards, immediately play all of them.
---
More like guys why am I dead omggg
---
No thats nothing to do with it. Its the fact your krabs can light a cyno and have unlimited fax and titan support in a second. In PB you'll have none of that.

---
You're kidding, right? This subreddit is usually wall to wall Tapi sperging. Slower these last few weeks given the number of fleets you've destroyed, but perhaps this tiny victory you've posted will give it new life!
---
Thunderfury blessed blade of the wind seeker
---
No you're wrong
---
okay now write the python script to differentiate it
---
Evictions represent spikes in the kill rate. Perhaps you could calculate kills/day and go with median values?
---
Nope I am sure you have gave us reasons in the past. It is just a comment on the fact there are 40 goon cloaked up in i00. Its a split system so the only thing they are getting is new beans that do not check intel.
---
 I am sure these guys could be bringing us more pain instead of siting on the arse picking on newbeans.
---
" That doesn't change the math. " the new dread and carrier insurance levels do though.
---
‚ÄúPutting yourself forward‚Äù = Break the NDA now
---
I know this is a game about meta, yes. 
---
But are to assume like you that CCP fucked over... when its far more likely that your leaders cheated?
---
And why would the fellow CSM players wrongfully accuse your alliance? Some of them are in your coalition.
---
Hell, if there were Goon aligned CSM members that did this, major kudos to them. Been playing this game since 2006, never EVER aligned with Goons on any form, but stuff like this makes me realize they are players just like any other and that they‚Äôll despise cheaters as well, no matter where they come from.
---
Ya

Are you not expecting any more victories then?
---
This is why i have to keep my safety on yellow. way to many accidental concords.

You can‚Äôt really beat something more that‚Äôs already broke.
---
Ok. I know an old corpie has my old fit for sure. But make sure you remind me. I'm about to sail the seven and have tons of shit going on that distracts me.
---
No... but I've seen a Titan wander aimlessly off tether when the owner was watching GoT... with about the results you'd expect. Ah, good old FCON.
---
Seeing how they have little-to-no revenue stream... probably a credit card swipe.
---
Don‚Äôt worry PGL - you keep distracting them with shit posts while the world burns around them k thnx.
---
in PB they''ll likely also have false flag "renters" calling for help and luring defence fleets into traps.
---
This looks more like an advertisement for concentration camps...
---
&gt; an initiation fee of 1b
---
sounds like Goon rental/membership scams of old.
---
i'm sure it isn't of course, but some people may be wary.
---
I would actually enjoy these
---
If someone asks for money to join goons, that's a sign your not being recruited. All you have to do is look at corp pages, the ones that are recruiting ban scamming by their members for a reason.

"PL is a relevant alliance"
---
I'd suggest considering joining a newbie focused nullsec group. They will have many bonused research and construction citadels and should be relatively risk free from being taken offline. Logistics might be a bit tougher than highsec but the bonuses should make up for it.
---
True, thats why all the best VR games are indies. Basically they are passion projects that probably don't even pay the bills for their devs. Still if CCP made that I'd buy it.
---
Tell him you scanned his signature!
---
Sent a PM a few hours ago, replying in case you don't check your mail :P
---
Nope. Those are combat holes.
---
To this day, I haven‚Äôt clicked the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt show me this again‚Äù to the warning you get when going from high to wh/lowsec, and it‚Äôs a funny little reminder of how scary wormholes used to be.

if you're running a poopsock op you don't want all your fcs to burn out, you need fresh ones to take over at some point.

No he can not just enjoy the ‚Äúride‚Äù on the tittyraptors.
---
Goons are the only faction to choose.
---
They are not slums they are subsidized by the glorious Mittani PBUH.
---
I happen to agree. It‚Äôs a base designed by the triglavians, that capsuleers will be able to use. Will require triglavian materials, which is probably what Brisc got banned for leaking.
---
I just see game of assholes when I read the title.
---
Why rent at all?
---
I bet he literally shat himself when it went pop.  The worse feeling ever losing expensive shit.
---
Probably skill injected and plex money bought mods.  You cant be that noobish otherwise
---
I'm sure people have wised up to it more now, but about 5-6 years ago a friend killed a TON FW dudes by beacon camping in an eris. Everyone took fights with it, because nobody knew what it was or how much DPS it could put out at 0.
---
To the OP if we are going to get this high quality ‚Äúgraphic‚Äù novel level of shitposting can we please get the illustrations to masturbate to?
---
I hope they get unbanned, because eve is a bit more dead with out them, but I've been hoping that with gigx for quite awhile now.

That‚Äôs not censorship you fucking idiot, if your comment was removed then it would be

#RorqLivesMatter

Amarr battlegroup next? :DDDDDDD

You can afford to welp a lot of Asteros with a bankroll like that. It's not dumb if you enjoy it and can afford it.

Can you be banned for posting this though?  :thonking:

kindly delete your account and then biomass (ingame)

We'll look at you and your tech ten speculatorianation.
---
It makes perfect sense, the correctly sized render of the "ship" someone made shows it as slightly smaller than a keepstar.
---
exactly T.T   no one remembers Dual 180mm AutoCannon
---
How is eve more dead with ~~Goonswarm~~ Init taking a heavy blow like that? If anything it‚Äôll make people move away from ~~Goonswarm~~ Init to other alliances.
---
‚ÄúI kindof like TAPI‚Äù
---
That cable seems important, probably not a good idea to let a fox chew on it
---
I bought one and fitted it. I'm stuck in nullsec and haven't found a single relic site.
---
Having fun tho!
---
&gt; Eve still here.
---
With despite many failed attempts, no other remotely successful game since. Of course EVE is still around when the only potential "competition" in the market is ED and star shitizen, a game that gets another 4 years added to release date every time it's "almost finished"
---
I‚Äôd say caldari and the only reason for that is you‚Äôre closer to Jita with your school. It really doesn‚Äôt matter much.

"Super umbrella" When one of your ships is attacked, if it has a cyno, you may search your deck for any number of capital ships and put them onto the battlefield
---
Haha, they tend to crop up in the places people seldom visit. Good luck!

"Goons evicted HK"
---
If hes Init... make sure he doesnt own a gun
---
So, you plan on losing any weight?
---
It starts to fly by, you just can‚Äôt be focused on your SP and grinding to get more. Just make sure you‚Äôre having fun. Sure not all of the ships will be available to your right away but you should focus on a role and get good at it anyways. 
---
If you want to be useful in fleets for example you should train for a Vexor Navy issue (with heavy drones) (to make a bit of cash), a Scythe and Osprey, and a sabre/stilleto. You‚Äôll be able to join almost every fleet in a mega null alliance with that and have money to buy ships.
---
I‚Äôd probably also just buy 110 plex with credit card and sell it on the market that will get you enough ISK to get started easily. 
---
And don‚Äôt try to pay for your sub with ingame money until you know what you‚Äôre doing, that‚Äôs an easy way to suck the fun out of Eve.
---
That is so bad ass and the reason I want to play this game but then I look at the 5 million ISK that I've made so far and the cost the ships people fly.  Are there groups that take new players that do stuff like that?  Once I make enough ISK to buy a few ships I'd love to try blowing some shit up.
---
Are there resources to read on how to do so? I must be food sped you see for I am mentally deficient

They'll just go to goons proper, so instead of init who occasionally tries to things you'll just have goons being even bigger
---
Nah a lot of them will move on Init thinks of themselves as elite and above Goons

I think all it shows is how good C4 residents are at feeding...
---
lol I've been threatened with worse in local and nothing came of it. If he had been co2 line member 1396 he'd be playing by now.

Init doesn't consider themselves elite lol (source, spent more than a year in init they're way more self aware than that), and you're right, some of them will go to snuff.

Tell him he wasted years playing some stupid submarine simulator and that he could've used his time for more productive. Also call him a no lifer cuck if he owns supers or titans.
---
You're kidding right? You know, PL had the balls to go for #1 spot and got it. They became the top dog. They lost it as well, but they dont bitch about it. Same for goons, they've gained and lost it a few times. You're are the guy whose ambition is as big as looking for a participation trophy.
---
Test and Legacy are far bigger than Panfam, but are happy to be the lapdogs of whoever is #1 and still bitch about few year old events, which are done and dusted and nobody really gives a shot other then get annoyed, which makes you look more bad, even tho you're all quite decent.
---
Get a soundboard on your phone with various alert sounds from Eve. That will drive him crazy.

Newer caps like the fax have bigger ‚Äúcorrectly sized‚Äù models. If the old ones were proportional to subcaps they would all be much larger. My speculation is it could very well be a ‚Äúnew size‚Äù dread.

Yeah, played it at eve vegas. One of my first thoughts was 'damn this is on unreal engine...' 
---
You gotta look at what DICE did with Star Wars Battlefront 2, sure EA did screw it up but dice made a really beautiful immersive game. 
---
You also gotta look at Planetside 1 and the second iteration, some of my best gaming memories were in PS1. Those games can handle 300 man shootouts. 
---
It is 2019 now. You can probably make a game with great netcode and graphics but not many people do it.
---
Some 20v20 shooter isn't going to be that breakout game. I believe that they need to write their own engine from scratch. Camelot Unchained is doing it and it is really hard, and I don't know if they will succeed but they want those epic encounters that will make the game stand out, just like eve has!

It's probably not a good sign when a large number of gamers (not just eve players) expect it to fail. And a significant number of Eve players hoping that it fails, all while basically funding it by playing Eve.
---
Unpopular opinion, but even a minimum wage job and plex is much better isk per hour than making money in game.

Hmmm, for once I'm above average. At least average age of Eve players heh.

Hunting the haulers can be profitable as they drop skins and I believe harvester BPCs. They are however very scary as they will call a support fleet based on what you attack them with, so be careful.

If the ship has a fleet hanger, such as a DST, you can access it after ejecting it without boarding. Otherwise you need to board it to access it.
---
You're talking about something else, that's just 'normal' NPC mining fleets and their haulers + the defence fleets they call in if attacked. In high-sec they're not too bad as you either get a frigate defence fleet which is easy enough of a cruiser one so just warp out if it's cruisers before they scram you. 
---
The diamond versions are rats near a FOB, they're insanely tough to kill. I've no idea what they drop though as I've warped off before dying a couple of times I tried.

Hey, well good luck with that. Space is big. And I know even two T3s could bring me down but first, I can afford to lose my ship and this ship is actually 1.5 year old and has done quite a few C3s so i guess it's not that easy to get me.

That's... actually a believable explanation for this heresy.

That player's ex-corp lost 80% of its members after it (left/kicked from) TNT at the end of February and went basically completely inactive; the corp description (google translated from Chinese) still says they're with TNT, EUTZ, and are looking for experienced players who know English; and that allegedly they're a PVP/FW group with 10% Tax \[actually 15%\] and 200% SRP.
---
... That PVP/FW thing is obviously a lie though given that their ZKill is a tapestry of Noctis, VNI, and Nyx deaths.
---
Looks like that corp just hard *died* and so yeah maybe this was just a round of someone trying to get all his assets out via an alt. ... A really bad alt.
---
Im not one for speculation but that sort of makes sense, as I recall a shortage of triglav materials (and someone making a post about the increasing price of kikimoras &amp; triglav weapons) right before he got the banhammer.

Correct. DED sites can be decent income, too. But there it‚Äôs mostly loot, which isn‚Äôt taxable either.

I mean, true and it is also enjoyable!
---
In addition to using the fleet hanger if it has one, you can just blow up the hauler and loot the wreck. You have to unstable all the boosters, and you‚Äôll lose half of them, but boosters are cheap compared to losing your capital ship because you ran out of them.

The triggers are somewhat random in high class jspace sites.

It takes forever but it can be done. Safer and faster method is tinker snakes/Nestor‚Äôs.

Still operating under the assumption that ccp is lying and doesn't have actual evidence to do this. Or else they'd share it with their new owners, right?

So default assuming ccp but brisc is completely truthful. Makes a lot of sense. Rofl. People are retarded.
---
I do not pull battlereports and had no intention to sort this kind of problems.
---
There is no misleading since I never show victim fleet size. Infographic shows only what is in killmails, so "20 people shoot one guy in this hole". Killmail does not clarify was this one guy alone, did he had fight in other hole and etc. And you don't need this information, since other side kill will look like "19 people shoot one guy". So infographics get 2 points of kills "20 involved" and "19 involved".
---
I'd love to have clear data on both sides, like "2 data points of 20v20", but this is assumptions based on zkb BR algorythm...

PS Hope you can understand my explanation, feel free to ask if something is not clear.

[Sorry forgot to link rykki's wormhole guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17cNu8hxqJKqkkPnhDlIuJY-IT6ps7kTNCd3BEz0Bvqs/pubhtml#) The spreadsheet is kinda the bible most use when starting out with these sites. It covers how much damage to expect (volley and sustained). You can use pyfa with your skills to make sure you have the skills to do the sites. Also another random tidbit, cap batteries don't affect the amount npc's neut from you, the only bonus is the cap amount.

Great graphic, but it's important to remember that this is a reference and not necessarily an indication in most of the cases of what holes are actively lived in the most.

You're more likely to get content in your chain than in your home in most circumstances, and the ones that aren't are completely dependent on mass limitations and which direction another pvp corp rolled in from.

you know a tengu can do those for half the price of that legion right. and just as fast.

This is great, thank you very very much for your relpy, you helped me a lot, apreciate it.

Because the south does not need CCP assistance ;)

Because they don‚Äôt have a lowsec gate to go to Spain

To be fair, we only intervened in this war on two occasions. The Titan save (i believe 4 is correct) and a final timer of a renter Fort in Branch. Apart from that GOTG held the line on their own, mostly due to their huge autz advantage.

You might well be correct sir.

When I was a rookie I found out about whs, scanned one down in a frig and saw a drake come through. This was also the time I would lock up ships and then click to look at them and well the drake immediately started to shoot me but the swift response of concord made his offensive short. First mill I made in game from the loot.
---
Depends for how long you want to chain sites. Tengu will run out of missiles long before a Legion runs out of crystals
---
Scamming Renters is a Blacklist offence. It is not done.
---
It is actually your moms dildo.
---
there are like two active c6 groups: Deadstar Syndicate and...i dunno, Indigo Generation?  The rest of it is basically for krabbing.
---
&gt;we play the game in accordance to the EULA
---
Now just wait a goshdarn minute mister
---
It is banned after 8 turns, but you have dozens spare that are redeployed after one turn.
---
you really shouldn't be running that many sites, without dumping loot. but a tengu can sustain multiple hours worth of ammo in a single run. and ammo isnt that expensive either.
---
I really enjoy the new station interior graphics. Thanks ccp :)

Just go with aesthetics/lore. Factions have no impact on your gameplay whatsoever nowadays.

im just stating. that you dont have to bling your pve ships. the cheaper ones will hit the same out put just fine.

and yeah understanding ISk/hr is not worth it is the first step on enjoying this game. and c4s are crap. i dont bother running my home sites.
---
Fight was over an azbel.  Horde brought ishtars and we were in domis.  When they got to Perimeter they switched to Feroxes and brought in NCdot and FRT Ferox fleets as well, so we switched to feroxes also.
---
Ferox brawl happened on azbel, was pretty even but azbel got RFed and then we extracted clean.  After that Horde ishtar fleet tried to go home but got trapped by smooth maneuvers and destroyed.
---
Its a trebuchet

---
pretty easy to hold the dominant opinion if all the users on this broken website downvote anyone who doesn't agree with you
---
Really depends on your setup, how efficient you are, do you get a roundrip, does the customer give extra tio and if you lose contracts. I can give some ballpark numbers:
---
- Freighter hauling is ~70mill/h per character.. Very easy too run many at the same time and scales linearly with the amount.. So with 3 haulers you are up to ~210mill/h.
---
- DST hauling is ~120 mill/h per character, but is hard to multibox past two.
---
- Jump Freighter hauling is often ~300mill/h per hsuler, but requires by itself several cyno characters. A decent start is 1 jf and 2 cyno characters that can fly interceptors. Again it is not hard to run multiple at the same time, so it gets very profitable when you scale out and it scales almost quadratic up to a point because every extra jf utilize the cynoes and every extra cyno speeds up the whole process .. A setup of 3 jfs and 3-4 cyno characters can make over ~1bill/h. 
---
The risk also scales with reward. While potential loss of a freighter is very small (you don't put over 2b in it), it is bigger with a DST.. And with JF's unfortunately huge losses are not uncommon while you are still a rookie :P
---
You're absolutly right, the less bling the better but I upgraded this legion overtime and in 1.5 year it became a bit ridiculous but you can run theses sites with the same fit downgraded to 1.2B. Less than that would be risky.
---

I got banned from FC'ing for typical jealous BS and I stopped playing myself.  Once I left a corporation they started calling my house. I think the issue is people take this "game" way to personally.

With that expectation I still had a lots of fun while knowing it was always going to be temporary.  I personally wouldn't waste any thought or effort.

When I was a spy I told my handler at the time Vicki Rail, that I would not do anything unless my account was paid for.  This was after a year or so of spying in Nulli Secunda. 
---
When I was a handler OOOOOO boy was that a shit show.  My goal was to try and convince people to run the GSF logger not for the plex but "for the benfit of gsf".  There was some pretty dumb (fun) stuff I got caught up in but overall I was a glorified salesman.    
---
PL and friends already know this but when we left gsf we only had one nc spy and one pl spy who the main duder (Vicki Rail) handled personally.  I told the nc spy to go native.

The only field where I think SP matter most is probably industry and mining, in mining and industry your SP basically determine your mining yield, your number and speed of industry jobs and refinery rates, among other things. But since there's only a fixed set of skills, you can catch up with some training.
---
Combat piloting is more dependant on individual skills, rather than actual SP. You need to know which fights to pick, tank holes and ship properties, which aren't given by SP, but personal experience.

It seems the slapped ranges on that where the same for pos guns and didn't think about how a it would work on cits. An since it works from a single point the docking range you get that problem. I guess if the range was set from the hard points it would fix that.

I think you could be correct. The devs have been thinking about doing something like this for a very very long time.

---
Weirdly enough, I kinda want to see someone do an EVE tarot deck now.
---
I have to point this out, since there are some things you‚Äôre overlooking when recommending the tengu.
---
The fact of the matter is that since most people in wormholes use Tengus/Gilas for their C3‚Äôs and due to their weakness in wolf rayatt holes. Most C3‚Äôs are actually farmed down to 4-8 sites (Pulsars are empty ) while wolf rayatt C3‚Äôs tend to have 12-20 open sites. That‚Äôs about half a bil of isk for a night of krabbing. Which isn‚Äôt the best. But it‚Äôs livable isk for newbro.
---
Also the range on HAMs are a major factor. You need to burn down webbers. IIRC i tried the loki and I had to burn down the webbers to get in javlin range. The legion has scorch which hits out to 40KM. Allowing it to run sites faster. It can also instapop frigs coming at it at range.
---
You‚Äôre also forgetting about nuances like the volume of ammo needed to run more than 5 sites exceeds the maximum volume of cargohold - Essential mods to swap.  It‚Äôs a real thing thats really annoying. Most PVE ganks by sub-major groups will be on your route home. Meaning its slightly more dangerous as well.
---
In essence the Tengu is cheaper for a reason. It may look good on paper. But in the context of C3 wormhole sites we must take more into consideration.
---
The fact of the matter is that the laser legion can run sites faster than a tengu, for longer durations at a time. With ample cargohold to go on extended week long trips. Scorch and conflag are absolutely amazing. My first legion cost me 700Mil and I paid it off in a single night in a wo√±f rayatt. So please please please. Stop recommending the tengu before you‚Äôve tried the laser legion.
---
Just imagine having to travel back home for more HAM ammo makes me want to gag.
---
Do you have a source for this? I've sat cloaked on a dread spawn and watched it warp off to land on a mining anomaly, not to mention the multiple occassions that people have left a dread while ratting in VNIs, only to have them appear somewhere else in system (usually mining anomalies, sometimes belts).
---
If you have CCP verification that this is not the case, please share. Experience dictates otherwise.
---

flying a plate buffer algos gives you a pretty sizeable hp buffer and is one of the strongest FW 1v1 ships - that is a pretty good ship to learn PvP in, it gives you more time to consider what you are doing so its not just over in a flash (like with the coercer)
---
are you using the FW maps to get an idea of where the action is? are you using dscan to check plexes? are you going to plexes to start fights, checking dscan inside to see if anyone is coming?

---
Electrical yes, exotic not so much. Vedmak has naturally low kinetic resistance and lacks major kinetic damage source. Gamma yes but it is sub optimal to Gila and other ships, it takes extra damage due to naturally low explosive resistance so you will have to fly in such a way as to not get hit in the 1st place. Speed and sig tank everything. It is really best for fire and electrical filament types.
---
Not an expert in PVP but I always go with "Know your ship capabilities and the ship of your enemy"   
---
Yes I pick up my fights and sometimes they dont go as planned but have learned from them and make me have a different view on fights...its not of what you can do its about what your enemy is capable of doing and always be calm.

Not the best advice but I hope it helps.
---
They bragged about a rorq kill yesterday...
---
Of course not. But that's *one* reason they get downvoted, and your post hit that reason along with like three other more emotion-based reasons, only one of which has anything to do with your supposed proof. Like I said, you're being an idiot and acting surprised that you get downvoted for it.

Generate infinite isk each turn.
---
Every 8th turn, roll a six sided die. If it lands on a 1, remove this card from the game.
---
During either your or your opponent's turn, you may play another "Bot" card that you own, except one that has already been removed from the game. You may use this effect in response to other effects, including any of this card's effects.
---
Does that work?
---
Well there's 2 options.  Either you're being brigaded by a coordinated cabal, or you're just a bad poster.  You might want to consider the second option.
---
I'd start out by looking at some new player friendly groups like Pandemic Horde to get a feel for the game mechanics and how PVP works. 
---
If you have the disposable income I would also recommend buying Plex (with RL money) and selling it for isk. This will keep you funded for a long time while you figure out which PVE activity you want to do to make isk.

I still have some troubles using the Star Map, so I generally just set a route through FW lowsec and shoot whoever is inside, since my corporation cannot be part of a militia. However, I do use D-Scan to get an idea of my surroundings and to find some targets. Generally, when I find a ship that's "engageable", I try to pinpoint its position with dscan, and if it's on a warpable celestial I go there and DIAF.
---
Well the Triglavian stuff makes sense because of the T2 Triglavian ships announcement as well as the T2 ammo for T1 guns.
---
I‚Äôm wandering if CCP messed up the scale of it, because it does have propulsion sections. Either they butchered the scale, it‚Äôs a mobile station, or a really really big ship.

I personally prefer the flattened old map ingame + dotlan, those together will help you get an idea of where to go quite easily, using the links I gave you above. the new map drives me crazy.
---
make sure your ingame map is filtered to "pilots in space" (star map -&gt; stars -&gt; statistics -&gt; avg pilots in space last 30 minutes) - that's generally the best setting to find people, but you can alternate it to docked/other things as well to see where people might be docked and willing to undock for fights
---
good luck!

And i will post locations of those until something changes - so assume that you will find info on each spawn on reddit.

TBH thinking about the lowsec ones ... like they don't need changes i guess but they lack the visibility for the vP part.

If you didn't notice - for some reason due to "publicity" of those spawns on reddid we had like 3-4 drops on people doing those - **something that almost didn't happen before**

---
   Concord seems very spiteful toward capsuleers coupled that with a total information blackout and attempts at censorship of triglavian data found by capsuleers makes them the villains in our eyes currently atleast in my personal perspective but I'm sure alot of other players feel the same.
---
 
---
 Fact is despite it being hard to understand fully the Triglavian Collective have shown a decent amount of communication by opening abyssal space to squads of frigates by information dispersed to capsuleers exploring their shipyards and most importantly they made a public declaration of intent when they hacked into the Concord billboards.
---
 That intent is essentially to destroy what I'd regard evil in New Eden-Drifters and Sansha so make no mistake we will consider The Collective friends and Concord enemies should we have to choose.
---
We can see it now)

Thank you for clarifying.  I hate lazy so-called journalists who don't bother checking with sources to see if what they are saying is right.

It's a UI issue caused by having completed their mission before having Aura send you to them. If it bothers you just find another set of career agents for your faction (each faction has 3 sets) and talk to them while Aura is telling you to.

Thats a silly thing a non-wormholer would do. ü§î you don‚Äôt take into account the fluid nature of wormhole space. 
---
- Living in a C5 with a C5 static means you can roll into a C5 with any class of static. So we regularly fight in all classes of space. Even 0.0, HS, and LS.
---
- Wormhole corps also like to have three ways with two other corps in wormholes. If not involved I witness a lot.
---
- most C5 wormhole corps have the isk to run 3 well SP‚Äôd accounts so. You may be seeing a lot of sabre alts that get repetitively blapped in fights.

- Most important, c5 space is small gang capital warfare. üòÇ‚úåüèø

So many of those rorqs are super shit fit. Is literally nobody there trying to help these players fit their ships?

There was one time when I was too long in a null sec (we've been teasing some nulsecers and they rolled our way back so I need to jump about 20j to other chain entery) After I eneter J-space.. it was like fresh cold  mountian wind that I felt through the screen.
---
Its free to play, jump in and give it a spin.

Honestly surprising. We help our guys fit their rorqs and tell them beforehand of how to act if they're tackled. Even made some how to be less bad material that our hr team provides to our newbros.

i really don't know why i didn't think it could be an alt. something about the "activity in last 90 days" on zkillboard made me think it was just some on and off noob moving his shit for whatever reason.

Subscription is better tbh free to play lets u do alot but not the best way to play eve. Most people play 2-3 accounts and making ingame isk is good for buying ships but you can sell plex which you huy with irl money as well if you dont wanna grind to afford things.

not even close - it's a subscription based mmo.

but paying to play is optional, just remember the old phrase 'you get what you pay for'.

you can pay your subscription with in-game currency - but due to recent questionable decisions by CCP doing so is somewhat prohibitive these days, especially for those who don't already have a strong and established income stream.
---
Eve online is free to play, there's lots of guides and advice for how to start. Find your own path, don't follow someone else's.

No idea. you might want to check the official forums, either newbie or pve sections. I do believe there were some people doing it in a Gnosis which is a BC, but I could be wrong. Also, jsut cause they can do it in a Gnosis doesn't mean all BCs can though they should.
---
We've had literal months of peacetime mining, including a couple of months where we had the entire shield super fleet umbrella.
---
If people haven't saved up enough Isk that they either don't need to mine, or can afford to lose a Rorq or two, then it sucks to be them.

We go through this every time we deploy or go to war.

Eve is more like "free to trial". But the core gameplay is accessible to free accounts. You just won't be as good as subbed players.

I guess I'll stay with Breacher a bit, however I have very bad missiles skills, most of my skills are concentrated in Gunnery as I used a ratting Nightmare for a while. I'll try to look up some PVP frigates using guns, thanks.
---
They are. Bs and lower are now frigs. Captials are going to be the new battleship class.

This is your new capital ship. Have fun trying to build a lot of these

They confused IRL ISK and in-game ISK so they keep thinking of more ways to create ISK sinks.

If those BPO and materials are the important I'd definitely recommend you remove them to a safe spot outside the WH as a precaution, just stash it in a station in the lowsec next time the static rolls a good location.
---
Brb gonna go make a character named dora the explore
---
Were afraid they will kill whatever transport ship we take. They have someone scanning and going into and out of the holes before we can. Our scanning skills arent maxed yet
---
I'm sure you know the lesson is golden.
---
Plus if we did that then we may not be able to get them back into the hole
---
Picking your fights means selecting engagements that your fit is designed to win. This is a bit of a simplification but there is basically brawling and kiting (and, for frigate fights, scram-kiting) - brawlers typically fit AB+scram+web and look to get into scram range, pin their opponent down and win the DPS race, whereas kiters typically fit MWD+point (sometimes a defensive web) and look to shoot their opponent from outside optimal range.
---
Each of these is the counter to the other, if flown well. Slingshotting is a method by which a brawler can trick a kiter into getting into scram range. (It's sometimes also possible to reverse-slingshot to break tackle, if you aren't webbed to hell.) In a 1v1 (unlike fleet fights) range control through tackle mods is critical.
---
As well as picking what role you want your own ship to fulfil and fitting it accordingly, you also need to know what other ships are likely to be fit like. This is why Tristans and some other ships are so dangerous - they can be fit in multiple different ways and you don't know until you engage.
---
r8 8/8
---
That's a real risk but if you get evicted as you said the corp might die. Better to evac what you can when you see an opening vs risk losing it all.
---
It's worth around 500b and we cannot risk moving it to lowsec. Were requesting help from rate my ticks
---
The most fun I've had was owning a station and fighting to defend it (even though I lost), it really gets at the sandbox nature of the game.
---
Who are you at war with?
---

---
Belt ones will do this. not Haven/Sanctum Dreads.

if you kill all the BS and leave, the site despawns, dread goes away as well

more of a question of why this enemy was so much stronger then the others
---
I just started playing a few days ago and can tell you one thing for sure: get a referral code.  You get 750 million skill points if you use a code to create your account.  This has let me instantly train some of the skills I need to do the things I want.  Some of the skills that I need take 9 RL days to train.  It's a bit annoying having to wait that long but I guess you can buy skills if you want to throw cash at it.
---
So you refuse to save your important things, or take the risk of saving your imporant things. I hope those important things drop when they kill your stuff.

Obvious bait post, but for anyone who finds themself in a similar situation, you want to evac the BPOs in an interceptor. Sub-2s align, shield extenders and hardener in the mids, protocloak and probe launcher. Use a matching fit to scout ahead in case of smartbombers.

You said you have 15 active members, 5 running shuttles, 10 run interference, and have some alts in empty haulers flying on autopilot at other exits.

the aggression on booshing is a huge nerf actually
---
Best advice: Join a corporation, which is our version of "guilds" or "clans" or whatever you want to call them. You will learn so much more quickly, and make a lot more ISK while doing it. It is *possible* to play EVE solo, but as I can tell you from experience, it's a pale shadow of what the game is when playing with a group.

Oh, and come to wormhole space. Don't sell your soul to the nullsec empires!

Here is an option. Cloak a blockade runner on a safespot and log it out until it calms down. If you really want to move them out, leave it cloak for couple of hours/days, have a covert scout check your exit, make sure its not bubbled, undock a fleet of small ships as a decoy, warp it on another WH and try your luck with the cloaked blockade on the exit. Good luck with that.

Unless it's actually a significant amount of rorquals or something stupid like mining during a CTA, why even bother posting these anymore?

7 Rorqs really isn't a big deal these days, especially compared to the normal amount a null alliance can put on the field.

FYI the Triglavian capital ship does have engines/boosters in its rear end, which makes it clear that it's a ship, not an FOB or any other stationary object.

This is obviously a bait post, but for the benefit of others -

'Don't fly what you can't afford to lose' also applies to the contents of citadels in J space. If you have expensive stuff in there you need an evac plan (even if that's just to put them in a cloaky T3C and log off in the whole for a month).

T2 command destroyers have a prop mod which, when activated takes them and every other ship with in its range 100 KM in the direction of the command destroyer. The whole act it‚Äôs called ‚Äúbooshing‚Äù and there are many metas, doctrines, and tactics that can be used with this effect.

AAR: v0lta was rolling holes. Tackled a Hel in system. Held the grid vs 4 nyxes and one aeon for 15 minutes with 4 sabres. GG fighter application. Dropped dreks and batphoned some supers. Lot of supers gotten out. Kept one. HK decided to rescue it with approx 10 supers and 12 hurricane's. Didn't know PL was 4 jumps out with a muninn fleet. Then goons suddenly jump in.
---
Same like im suprised as saw Goons call BL and Elo for help killing our supers and caps in Branch in Jul 2018
---
 I farm isk couple of months then go on a rampage then quit then come back and repeat the cycle
---
They both have uses. Buffer is easier to deal with for newer players, because it‚Äôs one less thing to manage (and capacitor can be an issue), but buffers don‚Äôt always add as much ehp as reps, and can limit either speed or increase sig, depending on armor or shield. Active tanks usually shine when the fight goes on for a long time, like if you look at lasker‚Äôs dread fights, they can last 20+ minutes against subcaps and he *always* fits active reps. Compare this to a dreadbomb dread, and they are almost always buffer fit, because they have massive alphas to worry about, and the damage doesn‚Äôt last long enough for the active to make sense.
---
Ah, Fractal Industries

Thank you for the AAR. Feel free to post a BR with it so i can remove mine. Don't wanna take your karma. :D

&gt; we see that the gameplay experience in its current form does not live up to our original vision and would not achieve our ambitious goals for this project. **As a result, we will not be moving forward with the upcoming invite-only Alpha until further notice.**
---
They could have worded their press release better tbh... the whole thing can be paraphrased as "It sucks. We failed. Apologies etc etc. Not even good enough for alpha. Probably need to start over. Might evolve, no rush to ever  launch it"
---
‚ÄúMake isk‚Äù? Absolutely. ‚ÄúSteady‚Äù maybe. Many pvp groups have a loot share system where the hunter gets a percentage of the loot, so you could try to get into one of those groups and make ISK by flying cloaky recons or t3cs and killing rorqs for those sweet excavators. Alternatively you can do fw and run plexes and get LP from killing people that come try to kill you.

Incessant complaining on comms distracts you and you lose 50% of starting hp next turn .

 I think that is as simple as this : if you have a lot of BPO in a wormhole, and you don't know how to save them if you need to, then you don't deserve to live in a wormhole.
---
Does this also apply to your nightmares?
---
You mean TEST hasn't been the good guys since you bent the knee and started calling it the Casino War. Imagine arguing that goon allies are the good guys in TYOOL 2019. Laffo.

---
Eve is dead. It's dead games all the way down.
---
Very good points.  Careful with a B-type, as you can see in several instances, my tank is barely keeping up, what saves me is having relatively high dps and speed. And having the combat probes is a big + . Also having the cloak ready.

Technically you did not complete it. You can complete what she asks by doing the mission in HER order.
---
1) go to another set of career agents. 
---
2) do as Aura asks and use the activity finderUI to contact them.
---
They will be done with you, but it advances her order of tasks for completion.
---
3) take ANY career agent mission, ANY mission with any career agent; That is ALL it is waiting for at that point, just accept. Done.
---
P.S. Would not be surprised if any agents mission, even if not a career agent will satisfy step 3, but it does NOT have to be the same agent you contact through activity finder UI
---
He got banned permanently from the game for leaking info, not that hard to connect the two. CCP presumably doesn't just ban people arbitrarily over something like this. The lack of transparency from CCP is the most frustrating aspect of this.
---
got it saved, thank you.
---
I'll pm you with new infographics in few days. (want to add some other data in it)
---
&gt;On the other hand, surely they could have double checked?
---
No, they sure as hell didn't. They're sourcing another article on the same day, same topic. And THAT article sources a previous article too. None of these articles have added anything new to the story except a refreshed quote from Hilmar.
---
oh thanks! Guess I'll wait for another day until the 48h period ends then try again :D

7 whole rorquals?? Test is doomed..
---
Anyways, there's something called a micro jump field generator which command dessies can fit. When it spools up, it displaces you 100km towards your current direction. It can be used to pick up friends or foes alike.
---
It can happen, quite often it is like 2-3 mids in someone space - so escalating it is not possible quite often.        
---
Additionally most of the spawns spawn in like 1/2 of eve while leaving other half dry, here is some details :

Could we get a bit further confirmation though, as in, has the project been put on pause but not cancelled, or anything of that sort ? Just to clarify any discrepancies resulting from semantics.
---
What about a big roomba to take care of citadel spam
---
You can try combat scanning drones in lowsec fw space (dangerous, but geckos are like 100mil and faction/t2 heavies are 1-2 mil)
---
You could also scam people, usually in jita local. be creative. I made like 80mil selling some guy a fake mittani corpse once.
---
Nope it is about spawn mechanic that works equal chance for every system instead of equal chance for every area in new eden.      
---
**or much much better** spawns in NPC null areas only where every one can escalate the spawn.
---
begin surprised that the BR is broken in 2019 :big thonk:

Planet V is blue, and there's nothing I can do
---
Yea, their article on Brisc kept calling him a politician, he isnt, hes a lobbyist who tried to be a politician but didn't make it.
---
One of our dudes reproduced.
---
But, HIC scrams have alos been an issue with MJD beacons for almost 2 years now. We originally submitted a bug report around AT XV, where it was first noticed. Don't know what happened to that BR.
---
Second BR, submitted around start of 2018: EBR-148159
---
Honestly feels like they somehow managed to spread the HIC MJD beacon bug
---
I thought it was when TAPI backstabbed their friends in the south to get protection from Panfam.
---
There really isn't a difference between a lobbyist and a politician anyway, so...

---
Eve has sound?
---
[This website](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/region) gives very good maps of all of new eden, and here provides the player and NPC factions associated with each region.
---
The [individual regional maps](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Great_Wildlands#jumps) like this one give a simple 2D map and allow you to check a number of different stats for each system at a glance. Recent jumps is probably the most useful for an explorer when combined with the "pilots in space in the last 30mins" on your in-game map, allowing you to find unoccupied pockets to search for sites. I selected Great Wildlands here as it's one of the quietest areas of nullsec, as well as not allowing control by large player-run factions, making it a good place to start out for explorers until you feel comfortable competing with others in more lucrative regions like Stain.
---
There are plenty of wormhole relic sites that can be run safely by an explorer, but only in C1, C2, and C3 wormholes. [This website](http://www.ellatha.com/eve/WormholeSystemslist.asp) has a lookup feature for wormholes to check class and what types of space it has a static connection to. Also make sure to check the wormhole system on on zkillboard.com to get a sense if it has active residents hunting explorers.
---
Wormhole relic sites with a pirate faction name (Serpentis, Guristas, Sansha, Angel, Blood) do not spawn NPC defenders. There is some incorrect outdated information to the contrary you are safe to ignore. Relic sites with a name starting like "Forgotten frontier" or "Forgotten perimeter" are populated by highly dangerous Seeker enemies, and most of the site value comes from loot they drop instead of the relic cans.
---
[This is the bible of wormholers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSbMMEBlM5BAFXldnnX3GDGfUp02OAuMznRljKkbpH4Ff3SyNTrkyEjHSJGkNJsDPqypSZw3sQmQ1Ta/pubhtml#) for information about what sites contain. If you check through the data, you'll see that the relic sites are particularly nasty, however some of the gas and ore sites are lightly defended and very capable of being handled by a properly combat-fitted astero with good skills or even something far cheaper (I've done some of them in a 5m tristan).
---
sadly most websites that cover the "news" these days seem to be hiring people without the ability to spell or form complex sentences and there's no sign of any kind of editing staff as even headlines on major news sites are coming out with spelling errors these days, PC gamer is not unique in that aspect.

Put them in an interceptor like above and either:

Safelog that toon in a safe spot and do not log it on again for the duration.

Also, move your expensive bpos to hisec, there's a good sotiyo in Kamio, and copy bpcs to move into the hole, never ever keep expensive bpos in wh space.

Hello all! I live in delve with my Corp of 1000+ we currently only have about 1,5 members active with a bunch of alts and we recently have been invaded by a small group of wh strongmen in our backwater farming pocket. Now we cant pvp well because were all using alts to do it so we try to scare people away with the number of alts. It usually works well for us but these guys won't leave. We cant mine in our hulk and rorq fleet anymore because they will try to kill us and is their anyway we can get some help? Also they've reffed our structures like our fort and raitarus. And we cannot lose these! We have so many capital componet BPO's and battleship bpos that losing it would cause our Corp to disintegrate. Plz help us we have a low sec static but can only maintain hole control during prime western us time zone. Plz is there any good guys left? Also i¬¥m gay.
---
Use 2 shield bursts, one for HP, the other for resists. There is no reason to burst for armor on an orca. If you are only using one burst burst for HP as it will give better EHP then resists will on its own.
---
ECM got a Buff, thanks CCP
---
yeah I completely forgot that all other fleet members are skiffs and procurers, they all use shield and not armor, it was a stupid question indeed
---
I mean, it may not be OFFICIALLY canceled yet, but after the development hell it's already been in, the odds of (if it is actually released) it actually being a good product are slim to nil at this point.
---
Thank you so much. This is incredibly helpful!
---
Inspect the different fits closer. It's really a mish-mash of every kind of fit.
---
Real "from the Havens" feeling
---
Yeah that alone killed solo CD. Makes me sad ((
---
Curious has Tom been to every system in EVE yet?
---
You'll need to be ready for a level V scan. ~110 Scan strength is required. Aside from that, keep your eyes peeled for a "Space Oddity" anomaly sig and happy hunting!
---
When reacting things into an Unrefined material (in my case, Unrefined Prometium), does anything impact the reprocessing percentage, or is it always at 50%?
---
Don't get our hopes up
---
I mean he probably knew, but vni application is very balanced and does about 2.5k per volley. If you don't instantly warp in a frigate once the drones are applying, you will die in a fire.
---
Yeah, blobs are the worst fears of a solo player... But eh, after seeing Lasker Emanuel's videos with solo Dreadnoughts and Marauders fights, I'd like to be able to do that one day, maybe on a smaller scale.
---
Concerning T3Ds and T3C, it's true I'm quite interested in those ships. The wide combinations of the cruisers are what I'm looking for, as I can cook way more easily a fit that appeal to me. And technically, the Hecate is one of my goal, as its modes and hybrids turrets are what I like.
---
I don't know much about Retribution, just that it is often used in fleet fights in The Initiative. However, the Jaguar still have that reputation of being a tough nut to crack, because of high base resists coupled with the ADC.

---
just meant that you'll get personal notification.
---
Eve sub is hella good tho tbf its not a 'normal' game sub
---
I see, thank you ! I'll take a deeper look at slingshots, it sound like a basic but extremely important maneuver for frigate and destroyer PVP. To be honest, I'm not that great at range control, so most of the fits I tried were brawlers... With an MWD. I thought the speed given by Afterburners wasn't enough to keep up with other ships and hold them in my optimal range, but I was apparently mistaken. So eh, I'll guess I can rework my fits and get less fitting troubles since AB aren't as energyvore as MWD...
---
Yeah I was confused about that myself, cause if the exit is camped 24/7 they never have control, or it's not camped certain times and they can evac at their leisure.
---
Look up Roko's basilisk. I want to have my ass covered when the mining bots become self-aware.

Launcher is a total piece of shit (shocking, I know). Anyways I tried to log in and it wouldn't log me into my account. I removed the account and went to add account and entered my details. It send me a verification code and prompted me to enter it. I entered it and this popped up. Really frustrating that I am not able to get on just because they fuck with the launcher constantly and mess stuff up. I am on a mac (if that matters)

If you have 5.0 standings or higher to Sansha's with Faction you will be blue to their diamond NPCs and will get RR from their logi.

I was sad to have found him once but still only have level 4 scanning. Even with a sisters probe launcher and probes I could not fully scan it down.

It's a pretty cool mechanic really. Have good standing with the NPC's and diamond and faction npcs will help you out.
---

---
Ok out of the loop for a few years but what casino did goons ever run? From my memory and the only one that ccp still points out on the economic reports is Somer blink. And then there was that other popular raffle style lottery. Pretty sure neither of those were goon run?
---

---
Except he didn't? He actually fared quite well for about two minutes, but then he started breaking. He wasn't being pointed or anything. He just stayed there, not breaking my armor and slowly died. He was either bad or just had a brainfart. He was using emp ammo as well, eventhough he would have known that i was armor fit since I had no shield left when he landed and was in the last wave of that haven. And maybe, if you want to hunt ratters, know wtf you are doing. The guy didn't even have an ADC fitted. Why are you so bitter about a loss that wasn't even yours?
---
Can i bring my drek?
---
Have you bug reported it?
---
Goons like to call it th3 casino war because the people fighting them for the most part were bankrolled by the group that ran Iwantisk which is like somer blink. The name itself is always argued about because the name world war bee was the first to be widely accepted and then goons didn't like it so they pushed the other name.
---
How so? Curious on your thoughts. Note: I don't fly CDs much so this is an real question.
---
I dont play this game, but I'm subbed here because I think its fascinating. Can someone explain this to me?
---
That's Star Wars, this is EVE. No station in EVE ever had the ability to move. There certainly are ships in EVE the size of stations or even small moons (as in the case of Iapetan titans) that can move, but they're still ships, not stations.

One of cornerstones of solo command destroyer was splitting up small gangs with a boosh on or around gates or stations. For example you could try and jump a single guy 100km from their gang and kill them before backup arrived. Now with the aggression changes, if you start a boosh, but get scrammed, you are now in the middle of their gang with a 1-minutes aggression timer and very dead.
---
Replacement for PoSes?
---
We're all gunna die, might as well not do anything.
---
Plot twist: it was him.
---
Oh, I haven't played in a couple months so I didn't realize they gave an aggression timer. Yeah I can see what you mean, that's kinda shit. If they are gonna change that then interdictors need to get an agro timer when launching a bubble. I mean they get on the kill mail with their bubble therefore it is an aggressive module.   
---
While we are talking about it, why cant I OH a mod while cloaked. T3 dessies can change configurations while cloaked (like their ship physically changes "shape"), so why cant I pre-OH...
---
It's pretty good mate. I like the quiet music. Very fitting for EVE's type of combat.
---
Nope...Some EVE vids popped up on my Youtube feed probably because I was  looking at stuff like Star Citizen and I got curious as to the state of the game, how old friends (and enemies) were fairing and so on.
---
&gt; I can only imagine what was going through the minds of test rorqs when a cyno goes up and 2 hostile rorqs come through.
---
Probably not much because (1) they were prob not paying attention and (2) because using rorqs as heavy tackle isn't exactly the newest meta.
---
Or at least a spell check bot.

You think he said something like, "hey if they came out with a new FOB, what considerations would you like me to present?"

---
WH space requires so much more of you in terms of system mastery that you'll be a much better pilot and player for having lived there.
---
Honestly it's not too bad if you have overheat mid rack set as a separate hotkey, you can OH and activate in the same tick very easily. I have mine set as the key to the left of 1, and activate mwd as 1.

True and loyal pet, cute occasionally.

Yeah I know there are work arounds, but still. Should be able to preOH if a ship is allowed to move their structure around with gate cloak. That's all I am getting at.
---
One'd think its not that hard to write CCP an e-Mail and ask for a comment that could a) clear this up or b) give you the opportunity to write that "CCP was not available to comment" which'd be a statement of its own. I'd always mail for a comment before pulling something of from a website.
---
NWO revived
---
That's gotta be in Providence
---
But Drakes are the best so the answer is always yes.
---
They're pretty great for lowsec pvp if you just want to use one pod for everything
---
I'll be honest here. I think it would be bad because gatecampers would quickly get used to people heating MWD to run their camps. In turn they would probably figure out that heating their own MWD and point is a good idea. 
---
I would prefer they just remain trash.

Not every fight was won by TEST, but farmed? really? not like FRTCo won anything on the offensive, even though they tried...

Yep wining if new ground for TEST, we don't know what to do with the isk from Perimeter, please HALP!
---
Well, bending the knee is how you can see that. Winning an unwinnable war, is just slightly differently worded.
---
Kay,
---
 but those BRs at least mean some sort of interesting event happened. While the isk value is interesting, it's just a basic determiner of who may have left with their heads up high. 
---
Rorqs die literally all the time and their isk value doesn't really mean much. Of course, the pilots who were mining lost. 
---
Then again LOL EXDEE TAPI DINOBRAIN LOST RORQS EXDEE !!!ONE!!
---
NOT Eve Online 2019 .....haven't logged in
---
I was a jock teenager football team captain when I started playing Eve in 2006. Got bored of console gaming and Eve seemed like the richest game that would run on my parents' piece of shit Dell computer from Costco.
---
I come and go. Recently took two years off to study. Some of my old corpmates and friends still play. We're gonna meet up again in-game as soon as I finish skilling into a freighter and moving house over to where they've settled.
---
It's amazing the wide range of characters that play Eve. Despite the psychopath in-game behaviour and saltiness... I'd say that Eve players are by far the most "normal" or average group of MMO players.
---
And it's truly global, too. You will learn what life is like in other cultures and countries just by chatting with your corp mates or being on forums.
---
The learning curve is steep and is more like a brick wall. But be patient! You will find something to love about Eve. You will.
---
Come join us!
---
dont put yourself down for thinking about what's the right thing to do.

I miss the time when Drake was dangerous thing to verse as solo nano pilot... [for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHGNdlcCntM)

Very much so.

Come out and play!!! ;)
---
I don't like the drake
---
who?
---
I use my accounts and alts to farm SP for only one character. None of them undock. Ever.
---
Resist vs. buffer is a worthwhile question though. Even if it wasn't exactly the question asked.
---
Well yeah you never know when "CSM members" will lie and set you up to get banned. I dont blame you

it's a triglavian station. if you just check updates to sisi on hoboleaks there's been multiple updates to effects files for a triglavian station. i don't get why people think it's an actual cap. there's a massive dock bay shown on multiple videos that looks similar to the size of the old Minmatar Outposts.

Take drugs! Lots of drugs and fly a ship that doesnt use whatever stat got the debuff.
---
For example, if you take a drug that buffs shield boosting, but got a penalty in, say, projectiles-- then fly a ship that uses non-projectile weapons.
---
And use implants, and fly pirate ships with dead space modules ONLY against T1 frigates, and use expensive modules but abysal them so they're only 1 ISK on your kms, and only fight new players.. be as dishonorable as possible, basically.

do people just refuse to load dromis into their supers?

Apparently they were on a statOP

there was another battle  [https://zkillboard.com/br/108694/](https://zkillboard.com/br/108694/)

literally no one

Bad news for your GPU

WTF is this bubble

The problem with solo dreadnaught stuff, they're only crazy fun if you can find a match vs a bunch of subcaps, but typically you just get dropped by Titans who haven't seen combat in over a year or other dreads or carriers.

I just don't show up to ops.

what high quality glorious nyx fits

Not to burst any bubbles but CCP has been talking about and showing iterations of walking in stations since I was at the  first fanfest in 2005?(ish). I eoupdn't hold your breath.

Good outcome for the game, so many cheaters in goonswarm there's enough on the CSM as it it tbh

Well back in the day if you were flying a vagabond or cynabal then the rule was you had to ram drakes.

I see this shit in my career. Other engineers with PhDs and their PE making spelling and grammar mistakes out the ass. Now I'm not saying they should be flawless, but can they not ask someone to read through reports before they get sent out?

I was Alpha for a while. I trained my skills. Everything was fine. I became Omega. I trained my skills. Everything was fine. Omega ran out. Now I can not train any skills, even Alpha ones. What do I need to do to continue training Alpha skills?

---
csm has set a precedent....and now they have to face it.  they've chosen blind accusations without explaining what the guilty did (even to the guilty party).

so now...accepting the position is like being put on a pedestal in front of a firing squad and hoping no one gets an itchy trigger finger.
---
51 cards of rules and explanations of how eve works. In micro script. And 1 card of Rifter art.
---
Sorry if this is already known, but I was told by multiple sources and this subreddit that the two don't stack.
---
I'm not exactly sure how I got this to work and which part of this is relevant but but what I did...:  
---
* I started playing in 2006. Left for 11 years.  This part is probably not relevant
---
* When I came back, I decided to download the game again through Steam instead of directly.  
---
* Came back wanting to redeem that pack on my account, realized I couldn't.  Made a new account on Steam (showed up on launcher as Steam::numbers under my old account I added in). I did NOT create a character nor redeem the pack on that account.
---
* Realized the Steam Starter Pack is worse than RAF's 750k skill points (Starter pack is basically 533k SP after the 7 days total IIRC)... so used RAF link from my original 13 year old account (but I'm sure another non-steam RAF link would work), and added that. 
---
* Initially only had the RAF Civilian Skill Pack I think in the redemption list on this RAF account which I did not redeem, but after about 24 hours the Steam Pack also appeared on there and Omega appeared on the account.
---
You generally don't fit adcs on solo afs
---
Once again EVE extends her claws to draw in the innocent.
---
Welcome to the rabbit hole, sweetheart. Just take a look at how deep it goes :-)
---
The black hole of side projects will continue to suck Eve money in, never to be seen again.
---
uwu
---
It also goes on to say:
---
&gt;We are aware that many of you have been eagerly anticipating the moment when you can get your hands on Project Nova. Please accept our heartfelt apologies for the disappointment this will no doubt cause. **We hope you understand that we need to take a step back and return to the drawing board, where we will spend more time figuring out how all this hard work can translate into something better and more meaningful for the EVE Universe.**
---
It's hard not to see this as them saying the game's essentially canceled. At best it sounds like "Project Nova" as an umbrella project that's trying to develop a FPS spin off that ties in with Eve will continue, but that's it.
---
  Let's be honest Nova didn't impress anyone and it shouldn't be a surprise it got put on ice until further notice or if CCP completely rethinks it in hopes of catching some of the FPS audience nowdays who like battle royale games.Atleast they stoped earlier this time to rethink it
---
We *just* managed to boosh out of the boson from the ragnarok, which then hit the nyx. Really fun, GF!
---
Big fan of the rag whoring on his blue titan with a doomsday.
---
The free part is true. It‚Äôs absolutely true.
---
The thing is though, you‚Äôll get some ways into the game with the free mode [what we call an Alpha clone].
---
And then this happens: you kind of see how this could actually be a good time. It looks gorgeous [it absolutely does], it has a great sound scape [there is an ongoing debate on turning the music on or off, I like it on. You also hear ships warp stopping that way], and there is *so freaking much to do* in there, there‚Äôs always going to be something you like doing.
---
But
---
you can‚Äôt really do those things on an Alpha clone. It‚Äôs just not enough. You‚Äôre going to need an Omega clone [all possible features are available to you]. And then you need to pay.
---
Having said that: I pay per 3 months. For that money I can‚Äôt go out one night and have beer. I just came back from a sports bar. I had some stuff to eat and drink. Costs more than 3 months worth of EVE. That‚Äôs 1 evening out.
---
You‚Äôre going to love it there. There is a freedom in EVE that quickens the soul. You‚Äôll know what I‚Äôm talking about when you get locked on the first time by people who know what they‚Äôre doing and you understand that your ship, everything in it and everything on it will be lost in the next 20 seconds. Also: your pod if you‚Äôre a little unlucky.
---
EVE makes the heart pound faster :-).
---
All their fcs are banned
---
Nice bait post , but if you are the evicter evicting these guys , please dont . They are great content each time we roll into them .
---
Its the internet, its just incestuous cross-references all the way down.  Primary sources are a myth
---
&gt; and can do most things in the game 
---
You‚Äôre not going to fly capitals, are you?
---
INIT seems to be doing well
---
&gt; You just won't be as good as subbed players
---
Even when you sub you‚Äôre still not going to be as good as the old hands, but if you only use an Alpha clone, you‚Äôre going to get your ass kicked all the time.
---
People got kicked from goons for less
---
When I started out [2008], I started with 900.000 skill points.
---
/just for reference.
---
&gt; take 9 RL days to train
---
This is not a long skill to train. Some take 30 days or more [depening on how much head metal you have].
---
I assumed it was cancelled too when the story first broke those months ago.
---
Join Horde. We'll train ya' proper
---
So are we getting pets now or something? Dam you pearl abyss!!!

Good supers are dead supers. But who really cares about them nowadays?

It's almost like black magic.

 The CSM has always been a tool for information leaks and exploits by groups with members on the inside.
---
big mood ;__;
---
The difference is the only reason the imperium is opening rental space is to wage economic warfare on their enemies that actually rely on rental income
---
oh, big mood
---
They set this precedent years ago when they kicked someone from the CSM for abuse. They didn't explain it then either (the kicked CSM member explained what he did in the aftermath of it).
---
Why people can't think to check what CCP has done in the past and expect them to do that again is beyond me.
---
but they only banned, like, three people...
---
This lol. 
---
Having said that; Unfortunately Nova isn't actually going to get released though. They'll burn cash for another year or two and eventually close it down.
---

good job.the love from Frat.

would you like HAM with that
---
aye, but it didn't have the same real life impact as it did now.
---
and showing is better than telling, so when people see the result it can have real life. it does more to scare them than telling only online
---
Complimentary free training only lasts to 5 million skillpoints. To keep training past that point you need Omega or injectors.

Goons don't scam their renters.  
---
Prior to Phoebe, their renting program was the worst (in terms of what value per ISK paid) of the three main renting blocks (CFC, N3, PL) but it was very well managed and thoroughly professional.  
---
Prior to WWB, the goons rented their buffer regions like Pure Blind, which was a horrible deal but was managed honestly and competently (why people would pay to rent that place, on the other hand...).  
---
The Initiative has been renting Fountain for over a year. Goons are now getting in on the action. They never kill the hen that lays the golden eggs, rest assured that if it is in their best financial interest to have an honest renting program, then honest rent managers is what they will be.  
---
It is funny that after all the spin about how they are free citizens of the Tapirium versus all the slavers / elite landlords of the other side, they are now embracing rental programs, but from the renters' perspective that is just another program, no particular risk of being scammed.
---
not even getting upboated by HERO nerds
---
embarassing
---
Also almost everyone had and can fly a drake so when you don‚Äôt have the ships the fleet wants.... there‚Äôs always drake baby
---
Consider the following: the backup fleet was landing as the 2nd nyx died. Would have survived in deep hull if he hadn't boson'ed it.....or king would have driven us into a glorious whelp to get that 10% dmg
---
Init has elected to pointlessly die at every opportunity, to mark the passing of Brisc Rubal.
---
&gt; Also turbokrabs have terrible situational awareness
---
  "Wait, what deployment?" *ratting in Hel*
---
So some goon CSM wannabe has abandoned their campaign because they're afraid they'd get caught breaking an NDA?
---
Oh, is that the narrative of this week? He was set up? Lololol
---
I used to work in a certain company as an internal support tech, one very small part of that job involved informing writers, and I use that term loosely, who wrote for (insert the name of a large well known news site here) about spelling errors and broken links in their blogs and articles that needed to be corrected. You would not believe how much these people complained to me about being told they needed to correct their spelling errors or broken web links to the facts they were referencing because they didn't feel it was a good use of their time and wasn't important enough to matter to readers... these same people claim to be "journalists".
---
not generic but pretty bad nonetheless
---
Brisc knows what he did. Don't let him play coy with you.
---
It is not a blind accusation. It was not done lightly. They do not owe anyone an explanation.
---
If you honor the NDA, you have nothing to fear.
---
I accept my judgment.
---
...and of course, [the best cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaOC9danxNo)
---
That's not a fair comparison. Tapi wins are so rare that all of them deserve posting. Like the sighting of a dodo.
---
On the other hand Tapi losses are so common that 50 bn isk is a bare minimum loss to be worth recording.
---
The easiest way to not get kicked for breaking the rules is to not break the rules!  No idea why folks can't understand it. If you don't break rules, you have nothing to fear.
---
Why is the op talking about himself in the third person?
---
Its weird as fuck bro.
---
Does anyone have an up to date Tengu fit for running exploration/superior sleeper caches using mobile depot refit? From what I understand the exploration bit is relatively straight forward. I've gotten around 7.5b in the last month using my astero. Not worried about that fit. The superior sleeper caches though are a completely new ball field for me. All I know thus far is that you need very high shield resists across all damage types/ cap stable/ data + relic analyzer. Am I missing something? Which subsystems and rigs should I be using? Shield booster needed? After scanning down the site I would refit to run it so I dont need super high scan strength while using the sleeper site fit. This is all assuming that I will be running the final room on the site
---
I would legit put the original sticker on one of my old rides though.
---
Yes but you can only apply the skill points that you inject via alpha injectors in skills that you could normally train as an alpha (i.e. before the 5 mil skillpoint limit). All alpha-certified skills together are \~20 million skill points iirc.
---
Which skills you are allowed to train as an alpha can be seen here:

This is an unfortunate consequence of CCP's poor handling of the currently ongoing issue with Brisc. I believe Aze would have always been a player whom the community would have benefited greatly from if he had been voted on the CSM. 
---
Aze, I understand your decision and support it. Until CCP can be trusted to handle matters like this more professionally I think it is a good idea you and others should stay away. 
---
CCP, you are losing great candidates for the CSM.  Fix the issue with Brisc and come out with a better plan going forward.
---
Lol k
---
Sprry i thought u meant a small gun not surpreme snall guns
---
It is very easy to kill you in highsec , you should be fine for now but once you have more then 200 m isk in a ship they will kill you and dance on your ship in 3m isk fit catalysts 
---
It is a good rule to learn now even if you don‚Äôt know the reasons why.
---
How does one manage to not get elected when on the imperiums ticket?
---

Had an issue with this the other night while fighting a drifter in a wh. boosher landed on grid and used my hic to scram the other rattlesnake. boosher jumped all of us off and i lost a 2 bill fit. then he warped back in again and tried to do the same........just let one die and called it a night. cool down needs adjusted or drifter needs to only apply disruptor........not like it matters since he can scram out to like 100k
---
He was ratting during beta op so main fleet wasn't home when he got tackled, some other dudes tried to save him i guess but it didn't end well
---
It‚Äôs possible that he is moving a contract
---
War doesn't start till next week or something. 
---
Till then we're still in Vily's "change of tempo" phase.

Truth often does.

Yeah, I mean congrats on finding the one true thing in the giant pile of bullshit.

This is also the guy who saved the last event when all their shit was stuck in customs
---
And yet he can fly away on his Zephyr...

Every alliances their krabs. Most alliances dislike j4j krabs with 0 situational awareness.

Thank god. My heart sank when i saw the article for the first time.

---
Whys that
---
It‚Äôs funny because this meme has been going on for so long that nobody realises that Drakes are actually solid ships.
---
Ham brawler drake does like 800+dps with 80K EHP while still having a web, which is some of the best buffer/dps combinations of the whole bc line. The HM kite fit is also not too bad in terms of dps although kite bcs were kinda killed by the ram jag meta.
---
And Drake Navy is an absolute monster, you can get 100k ehp with close to 1k dps. The kite Drake Navy is easily my favourite of the faction BCs with the application bonus and speed. The only sad thing is that the hull is kinda expensive.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Couldn't you abuse this by having an alt attack the npc miners in belt while you're fighting someone on your main?
---
He posted an apology message. Might have been on old forums. Basically he found out about moon mining changes, went back to his hotel room and bought all the Dyspro in Jita. I'll try to dig it up.

No, they don't want to get outed and have even the remotest possibility of having their name appear in journalism for something that can only be proven in the confines of CCP's headquarters.  
---
Who'd want to risk their real world position under the threat of having hidden charges blasted out in the news? Whether Brisc did or did not do what CCP claims his name is tied with words like corruption on media sites, and has no recourse to counter the claims. Who'd want that risk especially if your job is tied to some modicum of public trust.
---
We were on a fleet, they shouldn't have been ratting anyhow
---
Tbh what i am afraid of is that someone within CCP assumed that game can get a free publicity due to Brisk RL.            
---
I fear that not all was property checked and i assume this on a simple fact that no one from CCP cared to talk to Brisk first and then ignored him soon after.         
---
Something went very wrong in this whole process if no one talked to Brisk.             
---
Like before burning someone reputation you could just quietly talk to a person, ban the accounts do the whole investigation ... confront people with the evidences .......           
---
Christ so much wrong stuff happened.
---
Love Lazerhawks, why would INIT shoot them?
---
Quality post.
---
We were out blowing up your renters sotiyo.  NC must have been docked up.
---
A player that cared about game enough to support it in RL.
---
see, i've wondered about that.
---
but it doesnt make sense.
---
if he knows what he did, and he knows its wrong. its not something he'd want going public. so he'd make some small excuse and try to dissapear. 
---
by demanding publicly to know what he did, he's giving CCP permission to release it publicly, which if its really something that he did wrong, would actually hurt him in real life.   and he wouldnt be able to call it an attack on him due to him demanding they release it.
---
so logically, it sounds more like he really doesnt know.
---
and no, the NDA can be abused.   hell in World of Warships, i got banned for "leaking supertest"
---
they refused to provide evidence of this.  until one mod(who didnt get the memo) told me over skype that they found out the timezone of the leak matched mine.
---
when i brought this up, they unbanned me and stepped back. cause that "evidence" was so full of holes that it was useless.
---
Think your gpu is dying hard.
---
Tbh i want to hear that because BCs seems to be last used everywhere
---
HAS to be a bait post.
---
But, just in case... Put your BPOs on a insta warp ceptor, with a core launcher and cloak fitted, undock, warp away constantly from ss to ss, put your dscan distance to 1AU and scan constantly around, if no probes, logout.
---
Few days/weeks/months later, login again, and scan till you find a low sec exit. 
---
You have already lost the fort and the structures, unless the hostiles moved out.
---
The other alternative you have is to pay mercs. They are not cheap, though.
---
It's gotten a lot safer there since we aren't staging from there anymore. Thought it might work for just a bit
---
I quit 5 years ago, sold my 2 accounts for $1,500!
---
How are you certain it is not a blind accusation?
---
Asking RMT for help? Confirmed troll post.
---
I thought Drake was good, at least for PvE
---
Yup, bpos in a wh, its only a matter of time
---
I am just saying this. Mining Drakes. Really?
---
What war is this?
---
Mining Drakes. No.
---
Time for me to actually do my job I guess
---
I thought Drake was good
---
True! I mine there.... But I'm expecting to get ganked. I find it easier to stay a few systems away, stay on coms, and watch Intel for what's coming up the pipe. To many perma campers for me to pull out the vni there :-P
---
I laughed a bit at this, wish them the best and hopefully, they ship a week+ before next time to ensure it can make it through without issue

Totally agree. But was seeing people refer to this as though it is kspace, where the systems you love in are where you get fights. Figured it was relevant context to people looking at this with an intention of using the data to figure out what they want to do.
---
If you looked at my kb for vni losses I clearly have no right to talk to be honest. Happy ratting and hunting!
---
Because the legal ramifications of falsely accusing someone publicly are quite high. They have evidence of the wrongdoing. They do not have to tell us, and they should never tell us, as then it could help someone else game the system.

Carebear Deck is just Solitaire

I am usually in a Wolf or Svipul when they are calling for Triangle ships of some kind.
---
That's a good thing. Some risk. Otherwise you can just play gate games until next Boosh is up and gtfo.
---
sounds more like there "helping you"
---
Looks like people are noticing how OP the drekvac is.

Hull tank best tank

Once I saw him in local. I said ‚ÄùHi‚Äù. He said ‚ÄùHi‚Äù. That‚Äôs all my experience with the CSM.
---
this is why interceptors are a thing, get a wormhole scanned out, then give the bookmark to a ceptor pilot and have them run it out.
---
Yeah so technically Odin's Call only killed one super right?
---
My card died like 4 days ago, even if the screen was fucked up - screenshoots where "fine"
---
It depends on where you live and what you do. FW has major problems, but doesn't effect  the majority of players. Bots are a problem still, and getting small fights in NS is difficult in general. WHs have several problems, but aren't in a bad place overall. There isn't one single biggest problem so much as a bunch of smaller problems that compound on each other.
---
CCP didn't "out" Brisc Rubal's real name. He did it himself in a fucking campaign video.
---
its not like you need any tank, if they managed to get lock on on you... you allready dead
---
better loose less money than more
---
Does it work with other factions too?
---
HOW DARE YOU
---
Its situational but I see where you are coming from.

Journalism is dead. Integrity is dead. It's current year where corporate and political shills, hateful gossipers and bigoted culture warriors, all with garbage degrees, rule the day. Appealing to outrage culture and consumerism with subjective fake news is how we pay the bills.

There re skills and implants that impact it. Athanors and tataras also have a bonus to refining. Finally, you can rig structures to further increase refining efficiency. The max you can get is  87.52% if my math is correct.
---
Part of me wants it to be some supercap from hell that runs around nullsec spawning incursion like events where it goes after player owned stations and structures and you have to use supers and titans to actually be able to fight it.
---
You at least acknowledge a small part of you thought about this.  Either way you still have a great reputation in GSF.
---
Wow! Join CODE..
---
i have no idea what you are shooting at lol
---
That makes sense, i'm going to take it out on the test server first before trying on Tranquility. How often have you lost this ship and how much money do you bring in per site on average? I can get 40-60mil per site on average in T4 electricals with a phantasm and I've only lost 1 so far in about 40-50 sites. Havent been keeping exact numbers

He hated the Hull Alarm sound
---
Join CODE.. We will teach you HiSec Elite PvP.

Yeah they are super good, not surprised if they get toned down a touch. 
---
They make good whalers and small gang boats, although they are easy to counter. Most whaling drek fleets can't stand up to classic nullsec fleets such as feroxes, cerbs, muninns or ishtars.
---
Just the pirate factions I think.
---
They give you like the 8th spot on the ticket as a meaningless gesture.

Our spies in DnG told us that they were planning on dropping a fortizar somewhere, and like complete idiots they decided on putting it into a regular freighter, and not teleporting it to it's destination in a JF.
---
We had logged off over 80 characters in the system next to the system where it died, and were waiting for it to come through. We knew it's path and knew about this choke point and stalked it the entire way with 4 different alt characters.
---
DnG attempted to suicide gank the macharial bumper, but didn't realize that they were outside of optimal when they started shooting and failed miserably.
---
When it arrived in system, we suicide-pointed it and achieved the bump. We bumped it away from the gate-guns, and then landed our first run of 40 DPS characters. It did most of it's health, but shortly followed it up with our next set of 30.
---
The fortizar dropped.
---
I'd just like to say GF DnG and thanks for the fortizar!
---
Justice wins again

Targeted hit job at INIT FC, gets messy - conspirators gloat! Brutus you will get stabbed too one day. Next time INIT want to burn the whole north - there will be no mercy and no peace. You will be murdered just as much as you did last summer.  All you can do is get horny on Brisc Rubal and 2 main INIT FC bans!
---
You will always be a bunch of donkeys stuck on a bridge, doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results. 
---
Sort and KillahFlea did the shit smearing, but are now quiet while their hands are stinking.  Ruined someone's real life because you don want to undock your fucking casino faction titans. Enjoy your game!
---
CCP required me to out myself due to CSM campaign rules years ago its hard to find but its out there
---
Can I bring a Raven instead?
---
Great fight, 300 local FFA faction cruisers + t1 logi.

That's what she said.

Could've swore I just saw a post where INIT was bragging about taking out some small TEST ships. Seems like karma worked itself out.
