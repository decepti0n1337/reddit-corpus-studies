I'm starting to think this is the solution too. We have less players than we used to, but we have just as much space. Too much empty space means no conflict.

The downside to this is that it might hamper the ability for a small entity to break into null, but when was the last time that actually happened?

Complex problems often require complex solutions. It's quite rare for simple fixes to resolve complex, multi-variable problems. 
---
Blackout and the cyno changes don't appear to be complex solutions.

Passing through wormholes should be more dangerous.  You ship should have a random chance to explode when passing through one.

&gt;A corporation that is the attacker in a war may not join an alliance until they have ended the war.
---
&gt;However, a defending corporation may join an alliance, in which case the war will be moved to the alliance level as it is when the corporation finishes the alliance joining approximately¬†24h after their application to the alliance has been accepted. As the war will be copied in the active state, the war will usually be in a state where fights can occur and Alliance leaders have to ensure informing their alliance members if a corporation with an active war is accepted to join the alliance, so surprises once the corporation completes the joining process can be avoided. If the defending corporation has any allies in their war, these allies will drop as soon as the corporation finishes joining the alliance.

I didn‚Äôt have the blue play button on one of my accts. It was a grey square on the launcher but nothing was loaded. I had the go to task manager and quit something eve related. I think it thought it was loaded but it wasn‚Äôt. Idk. Might help you.
---
T3 should have been simple to begin with. My idea of modular was to take a low slot and move it to a mod slot... or swap a turret point for launcher... and so forth. They really complicated it by giving all the different mod parts their own bonuses. A T3 cruiser shouldn't be anything you want, it should fit its racial stereotype, but give you the ability to swap things around. 
---
I would have been happy with making T3 the same cruiser hulls as all the T1 counterparts, but adding swappable slots, weapons, drone space, etc. They wouldn't be overpowered, they'd just be different. 
---
Then you have room for T4 to modded T2 ships.

Starcraft:  
---
Finite quantity of minerals PERIOD.  A Starcraft game will always end in one way or another unless both players stop playing.  
---
Finite 'Army Caps' with 'workers' included in the cap.  No one turtled with 100 SCVs because then your army was smaller and you lose.   
---
Starcraft specifically allows automated, defensive buildings, at no army cost, to counter balance this factor.  Eve just removed automated defenses.
---
I am not going to go into the rest, its all the same old shit.  You are trying to balance from the top, and the bottom dies because of it.
---
That marine you send in to die to scout that you wanted to get rid of because you had supply cap and excess minerals and lack of intel, that was a player in eve.
---
As someone who is strongly opposed to skill injectors, I think the free sp events are pretty rad. They don't disrupt the balance between casual and power gamers like skill injectors do, but they do help newer players get into bigger ships to be killed in. Cool.
---
Please everyone come to provi we are starving for people to protect and people to kill
---
You sure? That was all the talk when they were introduced. Modular frigs and battleships.
---
I wouldn't worry to much about losing current player, rather the 96% of players that quit after 1 week TBH. If anything is killing Eve it's that, not these changes.
---
How? Is this just a glitch?
---
I could have lived in a wormhole a long time ago, just more word salad.

Open the in game compare tool, drag all the drones into it and start clicking on a bunch of stats. That will tell you everything you need to know about how different they are from each other.

Was in RCJT, but they left to go to low sec. I followed them with one of my pvp mains and we had a week of good fights, then ccp announced cyno changes, and i haven't logged in except to give people back their stuff that i was going to move for them or was building for them. Dreddit was willing to take all my alts and my pvp mains. I still get to fly with predds and other cool sigs in test, so I don't see the correlation between my $40,000 and me joining dreddit.

C5 Anoms drop afaik roundabout 250-300m in loot, how are you getting 1.5-1.8b/h with 20min site times ?

Sounds like your math is off by quite a bit there, unless there is something I'm not seeing here.
---
Isn't this what half of /r/eve wants any Trig capitals to be?
---
Mc never kept up with changing times, they were too stuck on elite pvp when all they could bang together was a cormorant fleet at best when the game was at a time where every group was building its dread cache. The leadership was short sighted an despite being told by many people what course of action needed to be taken (and it was very much the opposite of tribute is killing mc which was the misguided narrative) pride an "but our green killboard" rotted them to a husk that finally gave out.  It was a shame there were many good people i enjoyed playing with in mc.
---
With links and implants, yeah.
---
i mean, isn't it though? it'll die just the same eventually and the amount of isk and time involved kind of balances it out the benefits. its stupid expensive for like a 50-60% non-permanent boost, not to mention he probably has links on grid too
---
Well I know what I'm going to be rolling for now for standing fleet. Lol
---
Holy hacking heck. Imagine having a point on you from a ship 100KM out.
---
I would probably cry XD
---
Test test
---
It's a near-perfect roll with perfect links plus a mindlink.
---
I love the Triglavian ships, all of them. They're just such sexy ships like mmmmMmMMM look at those sexy hulls especially with Blackfire Steel SKIN. If I could have it my way, I'd fly nothing but Triglavian ships; alas, sometimes the situation requires I take a different role. So point being is, I've spent my fair amount of time theorycrafting them. Most of the ships have a pretty decent variety of roles, and can be fit a number of ways due to their ship role bonuses. 
---
The Damavik and Nergal, however, I've had to come to the unfortunate conclusion that they can serve one role efficiently, and that's as bait. Everyone knows Damaviks and Nergals suck ass AND are incredibly shiny, they will be primaried nearly 100% of the time in small gang play; the gang is ISK positive if they get that one ship, after all. So if you can fit the ship to be just tanky and evasive enough to escape when the cavalry arrives, then it did its job.
---
They're not exactly the fastest ships, but they're in that direction. Pop some Overclocker IV and Quafe Zero to make up the difference and be ready to [practice the Secret Joseph Joestar Technique](https://youtu.be/7GaJUmefY1I).
---
Let's say we did, and don't.
---
And yet you still feel the need to complain on the eve subreddit. Not really winning ..
---
This is true. The only time the game gets any publicity is when we are out there in a massive super battle with like 30-40 titans blowing up. Then its literally on the news the next day or two and several articles on Forbes saying how hundreds of thousands were destroyed. That's what we need to do.
---
"Balanced" by the fact that you could buy a couple of fit carriers for the price of that single point.
---
...OPs 4 Rattles and 1 Rorqal also don't do 7.5k DPS
---
The main purpose of null is whatever comes with the security status of the systems. Different PVE, no sec status hits, no gate/station guns, and no CONCORD. Anything beyond that is the will of the sandbox.
---
haha good one
---
You can train alpha up to 5M SP. That's the tradeoff for newer players. It was never this way before. New players years ago were ripped off harder.
---
I run an abyssal point on my doctrine Lachesis. If I recall correctly it's just under 100km with links (no implants) cold. While it's cap hungry and I have to be aware of the fact, it didn't cost me much. I rolled a single point and get mine. So just add the standard faction point + the most expensive roll thingy.

Good question. Not enough to be a drop in the bucket for me now.  I'd actually be sure to keep in touch with him instead, build a network, work friends, meet people, chat him up. People are a more valuable resource than isk. Friends too especially.

that's true, just pointing out other long playtime games that were popular. not sure what the playtime is like for grand theft auto but that's the only other sandbox mmo that comes to mind.
---
Well it's a "roll", so it won't always go that well. You could end up with something on the other spectrum, to a point where it's just trashed. That's generally included in the price, even if you got lucky on a specific roll.

Like i replied (in more detail here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cvtqyq/the\_dimming\_light\_of\_the\_cyno\_and\_the\_death\_of\_eve/ey78jji?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cvtqyq/the_dimming_light_of_the_cyno_and_the_death_of_eve/ey78jji?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
 to the OP in the other thread...
---
1. Don't expect the game to serve you your definition of end-game content on a platter because you now have a job and a kid (also, big capital fights are not everyone's definition of end-game content...for many of us, flying slow-ass bathtubs in heavy lag or, more recently, 1% tidi is more boring than mining, has been this way since the beginning in 2004 or so and has been the reason we haven't stuck around with game continuously and only play on and off, but more on that later on in this post).
---
2. Don't expect to get the same rewards you got when you were a college student and putting in massive time, now that you have more RL responsibilities and can put in a fraction of the time, just because you got used to it. Make some room for the newbros, which brings us to...
---
3. Get good or downscale, or completely change your primary activity. EvE is so massive, try out different things, experience it, play the damn game. Do something else with a smaller, more close-knit group where your individual actions matter more, where you need much less alts than before and much less isk to maintain that playstyle. Get out of sov null if you don't have the time for it, and maybe there will be room left for newbros and younger players to rise up through the ranks there. Or your coalition will just suffer a massive drop in its experience pool and get stomped by someone else but still, both outcomes result in less stagnation and less boredom for everyone. You are not your alliance tag, unless you are someone who's been there from the start through thick and thin for the majority of your EvE life. This is especially true for the average line members who are recruited at a massive scale. Sure, join up a 20000 player group, it's fun. But the moment it stops being fun, get yourself out (along with the 10-20 friends you made there) and go do your own thing, you'll have more fun in the long run.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Now, as for the way to balance things out...i've already posted an essay on this (here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cdxaf5/thought\_on\_the\_lack\_of\_interdiction\_mechanics\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cdxaf5/thought_on_the_lack_of_interdiction_mechanics_in/)) and surprise, surprise, line members from some of the biggest null blocs responded favorably, because they are probably bored out of their minds with the current meta as well.
---
To put it simply, EvE warfare on the strategic scale plays out more like a medieval siege and less like modern, combined arms warfare. In reality you'll never see a fleet of all carriers without smaller ship escorts, because all it takes is 2-3 submarines (aka cloakers) to ruin their day. You'll never see a division fielding only long range artillery or pushing with armor (capitals) without having infantry escort to guard their flanks, because they are either useless against or very easily ambushed by enemy infantry (frigates and cruisers) that manages to sneak up close to them . You'll never see an air assault spamming the biggest, most cumbersome bombers at the general direction of the enemy, without at least three times as many smaller, faster, multi-role platforms organized in groups that complement each other (instead of flying a single "doctrine") paving the way and clearing a path through the enemy defences for them. 
---
But in EvE we see such bland, boring craziness all the time, because the smaller stuff has been rendered useless by the bigger stuff having such a broad application profile, that they are too good at too many things at once, so there's no reason to bring out the smaller toys at all. And this is what makes not only the actual act of strategic warfare boring (large scale fleet combat is about as engaging as PvE to be honest, in PvE at least you are actually flying your own ship), but it also incentivizes blobbing up, which makes the lag unbearable and "start ops" about as interesting as watching paint dry.
---
But imagine now if piling 1000 pilots on a single grid got you the same results as splitting those 1000 pilots in 10 smaller groups of faster ships and have them roam and terrorize enemy space in a way that actually mattered strategically, what would you do? Sure, a lot of people would still do the big capital fleets because they enjoy it and that's fine. But there are also a lot of people who would prefer the "split up, encircle, interdict and stay mobile" way of doing things.
---
These people currently have no valid way to influence the situation, apart from getting swallowed by the blob, because there are absolutely no game mechanics in place to support this. That's a huge oversight and the source of many problems in the game, both in terms of the meta and in terms of average enjoyment derived. To put it mildly, strat ops are fucking boring for a large amount of players because the ships required for them are too big, which means the movement is too slow, the numbers required are too big and as a result the scheduling of it all is too difficult, the logistics and coordination take even more time and the risk is too high (which very often leads to jumping half way across the map and not even engaging anything).
---
Instead, we should be able to take 10 fleets of 100 people in smaller ships, rampage through an area and shut down enemy station services (targettable citadel/station modules, shootable right away, no timers and no invulnerability windows, but also easy to repair by the defenders), instead of coalescing all these people in one 1000 player fleet on a single grid, which usually ends with a mexican standoff/blueball situation depending on who has the most capital assets.
---
We should be able to consistently do enough damage to an alliance's money making backbone (the isk makers, miners and producers) by guerilla attacks, so that the enemy alliance is pressured into committing to a fight, abandoning territory or losing the war. You know, like we used to be able to.
---
In other words, we should have meaningful counterplay options against the blob, in a way that incentivizes breaking up our own blobs into smaller, more mobile detachments that can run rings around the bigger, slower fleet compositions.
---
This also opens up a much richer strategic decision process for top level alliance leads and FCs. Will you choose to maintain an impenetrable defence in your core systems (similar to the current umbrella) but relinquish control of the surrounding areas to the enemy blitzkrieg detachments? Or will you counter them fleet for fleet, spread out across your territory and hunt them down, resulting in a series of smaller, running engagements that span the entire day for non-stop, round the clock action in much smaller, engageable and replaceable fleet compositions?
---
Long story short, the mechanics of smaller fleets, down to the size of microgangs, should be similar but scaled down versions of big capital fights, with actual impact on the strategic scale. This would make fighting more fluid, more fun (for some people at least), more spread out over a larger area and less laggy as a result. And the people that don't like to play this way would still have the option to go in capital-heavy like before, but this time they would need some escort screens made up of smaller ships.
---
If something like this came to pass, i expect that most groups would simply divide their fleets into different compositions that players would join, either according to their wealth ("i'll stay in the skirmisher standing fleet while i make some isk to get into a capital of my own") or their preference ("i've got 50 million SP and still can't fly capitals, but i can FC our newbros in groups of 20-30 to run rings around anything they throw at me, i got your back capital fleet guys"). The important thing here is that all of those compositions would be viable and useful in a strategic sense, so people would have more choice in what they do while still being useful in the grand scheme of this. Because let's face it, the current situation is  more like "join some blob to rat/mine and make isk, then join boring strat-ops to have the right to remain in said blob and continue farming isk, so that i can finally have access to the specific ships and  SIGs i actually wanted to play all along".
---
And guess what, this would also let some new talent rise through the ranks. This is quite important, because one of the looming problems for big null blocs may be an upcoming lack of competent FCs if/when the handful of remaining old-timers burn out and quit. This will lead to even more stagnation, because people will be too competent in defending if the mechanics remain unchanged (you can always drop enough under your umbrella to drive people off) and too incompetent in attacking ("all i learned to do was anchor up and F1 when told, halp!").
---
Frankly, the blackout, the drifters, the triglavians, the taxes and the cyno changes range from small experiments to useful little steps. But maybe it's time to finally acknowledge the elephant in the room. What's needed to make all the above happen is a rebalancing of all ships classes first and foremost (followed by structures and "farmability"/depletion of resources).
---
Subcaps are far more balanced between them than they are against caps, and adjusting them against caps would also mean having to readjust them among themselves. Eg, if you make battleships good against carriers, they will then be too good against cruisers so you'll have to buff those too, then those will be too good against destroyers, and so on. Getting this right might take years. So, what's the elephant in the room? Well, the only efficient and timely solution is to adjust capitals against subcaps, since they are the primary source of imbalance and they are a single ship group. If CCP really wants to start fixing things, this  will inevitably end with capitals getting nerfed into being unable to effectively chase subcaps and apply damage to them, and being unable to stay on grid without subcap escorts of their own. This translates to nerfs like the current cyno changes and extends all the way to EHP reduction, inability to tackle by yourself (support fighters no longer scram/web, NSA only applies in locking enemy fighters and other caps, not subcaps) and a massively reduced application against subcaps (HAW weapons are deleted).

The classic Nullsec experiences. I think NS missed the mark, and LS should've been what Eve was about all along. WHs, while I enjoy them, should've been day-trip only. NS was made the way it is by the players and having just a tad too much control over risk-reduction. Look at the backlash to the Drifter attacks, the black-out and any other nerfs to what players have bent to their will in order to remain risk-averse.
---
Also, yes, do not remind me of the insta-bookmarks. Oh so painful just to travel and have folders setup for routes, then limited by a smaller bookmark total. Again though, that was players avoiding the risk measures put in by CCP. They were only normalized because "the players are gonna make these bookmarks anyway, /le sigh..."
---
Anyway, HS kiddie pool, LS fun PVP zone, WH day-tripping risky risky isky isky and then NS... maybe just get rid of it? Fold it into LS and remove player stations. Look at the BLIGHT that Player Stations have become in HS with them populated everywhere... such clutter.

---
Not really. You have a 1 in 20 chance to get a point in the +95-+100% factor. You have a 1 in 4 to get a point in the +50-+100% factor and that will usually push it to ludicrous range on a warp disrupt bonused ship. You pay less than a bil normally for such a module, and you can also sell the ones that roll very high and just use the 70%ish rolls, not to mention sell the slightly buffed ones to compensate.
---
It's less expensive than you think, and on a killmail it doesn't add value whereas a faction point does.
---
That doesn't mean it's *worth* 500m.
---
I've neer actually seen anyone fly Triglavian ships other than Kikimora, Drekavak, and Leshak. How good are the damage and logi cruisers? And are the T2 versions worth the extremely high price of being both T2 and Triglavian? What about the command destroyer?

20 bombers vs 1 carrier isn't just 1b worth of ships va 1b worth of ship. It's also 20 accounts (likely played by 10+ real people) vs 1 account played by 1 person.

Nerf capital EHP. Caps have massive systems they have to support - massive engines, jump drives, massive weapons, fleet hangars, fighter bays, seige infrastructure... all that stuff conceivably takes up a lot of space in the ship, space which isn't adding to the EHP pool. Caps also need a defined role and need to drop their ewar immunity. Resistance is fine but immunity is garbage. It used to be battleship/dreadnaught/carrier and then supercaps came and broke the balance completely. Subcaps need a place too. But the biggest thing would be to nerf cap EHP and nerf dread tracking so they're mostly there to counter carriers and Titans.

There is plenty of fun to be had in cruisers.  Its not hundreds of dollars.  Its not even a hundred dollars.  You can also just play the game to earn the isk...  The first character I bought was 5 months after I started with isk I earned in game.
---
Nope it is under DLC on the website
---
I dont know why people downvoted me.  Id be happy to clear anything up that they find confusing...
---
Basically the reason you do different accounts is so that you can play both characters at the same time.  
---
For instance I have 3 main accounts all with characters that complement each other.  I am able to have all 3 characters doing stuff at the same time.  I use an overview so that its super easy to watch them and switch to the account that I need to alter at any given time. 
---
Seriously though, dont sweat the fact that you are "far behind".  Any character can only fly 1 ship at a time.  A 100 million sp character in a cruiser is only using roughly 30% of the skill points they have accrued. In other words a 30 million sp character can be using the same amount of skill points as the 100 million sp character while each are using a specific ship.  Many alliances use cruisers or smaller as a main doctrine.  
---
Basically high sp doesnt mean useful sp or even how much sp you are currently using.  I spent months training all the subsystems for all the t3's (every race), but I can only fly 1 at a time on that character.  The other 75% of the subsystem sp is literally useless. Sure I have more options than a newbro when it comes to what ship I go hunting in, but that doesnt give me an advantage when I am trapped in a bubble 20 jumps from my home system.
---
They added a garrison that leveled up as you played WoD expansion.  The game basically became: sit in garrison waiting for a queue or world boss to pop, and harvest the same three resources everyone in the game could harvest regardless of gathering profession.  It got to the point where you wouldn't see anyone unless they had to run outside the garrison gate to get the daily blingtron quest.  They tried to carry it on in Legion with guildhalls, but they were instanced to class, and had less functionality.
---
Yes jump freighter pilots will all of a sudden go full retard and jump into the middle of wormhole space without any safety. Do you re-read your own posts and then think about what you wrote? I mean sure maybe there are a few retards that will do it, but for the most part Null sec alliances will just get a bit more organized about doing it and either drop forts in all the wormholes they need (because what the fuck is 100 more fortizars to them) or they will just plan a bit in advance and do logistics in groups so they can actually form up to defend their JF pilots.
---
You'd be a fool to think that too many JF pilots will just risk 10 billion ISK ships with billions isk worth of cargo without at least some safety net.
---
Just wait for TBC ;)
---
In previous circumstances selectively recruiting models would be able to compete very well. Not anymore. This invalidated entities like NC, PL, skillu, V0lta, Origin, Snuff, the null wing of HK/Lazers etc. Some left. Some went for daily content. Some keep in the game as less relevant actors. In an Eve which didn't experience the Rorquals, injectors, citadels, removal of moon goo etc, there are plenty of entities who could have been strong rivals of Goons.
---
And selective recruiting could come back as a meta even after injectors. Imagine farm per region was really limited, so only 1/20 of null population can live off an umbrella. You'd suddenly see hardcore players stacking certain regions, and the casuals moving to others. 
---
The current meta is a design decision. It is not a fate set in stone.
---
\&gt; In the end, it is very probable that Eve won't survive a transition to a more sustainable game. It catered to the low risk PvE side of the game  too much for 5 years. At this point, the game might have lost enough PvP'ers to the compensate for the PvE players leaving the game.  Moreover, the sheer propaganda and organizational powers of null mega  empires do not make it easier to balance the game against their  interests. Even Hilmar is getting so much flak, so I am not even  surprised why I am getting it. 
---
Well, most of the actual situation has been created by CCP himself.
---
For my point of view, everything started in 2010/2011 when CCP decided to simplify the access to high-end ships and modules. For exemple, Capital Ships required Battleship V but not anymore (minus 30 days of skilling, and making BS obsolete in the process), many modules who required level 5 was downgraded to level 4, etc. Few intelligent leaders realized that being always bigger is better with this kind of modifications, and so decided to lower the recrutement pre-requisites. Even day-one newbros are fine, they will be coached and they will get a capital ship fastly.
---
The lack of appropriate and fast responses from CCP to any problem who would surge also contributed to the actual situation. Even the Citadel proliferation would have been avoided if they reacted fast enough. The Citadel proliferation was already visible BEFORE they were even released, because of stations. They costed only 15/20 B each and provided so much services, so when the players became efficient, they built a station in nearly every system of the galaxy... In a way, CCP did have one previous experience to know what would happened with the Citadels.
---
And more importantly, CCP didn't (and probably still don't) realize that players would become so much efficient at raising ISKs, manufacturing, etc. Even when the modern Rorqual was introduced, CCP knew that they would have to nerf it (and they did) but they could have done a less desastrous job if only they trusted our ability to exploit all the potential of EVE. They still consider us as children, despite being equiped by Pyfa/EFT, Evemon/Cerebreal, Googlesheets, etc.
---
Still, it is pointless to try to correct the game, it can't be saved since 2016... because the last screw on the coffin was the Skill Injectors. The day they were introduced, the game died. Why ? Because whatever CCP would do in the future (even the actual Chaos era) can be compensated by more people and more skill points. Covert cynos for JFs ? No problem, injecting 1 or 2 Skill Injectors and I have Cyno Theory V that I wouldn't skill otherwise on my cyno alts... Rorquals can't be safe easily ? No problem, building fortress-like pockets with dedicated scouts and a decent security will be restored...
---
EVE is done. CCP screwed up.
---
So if they REALLY want to correct everything, they will have to screw the new players and so rebalance the pre-requisites as it was before (I am sorry for them, but it is mandatory). It won't solve the actual proliferation, but can prevent a future one and it will probably restore the battleships and exhumers who became useless since then (yes, exhumers. Why skill them when you can get a Rorqual who mine more even with low fit and low-end drones ?).
---
They will have to remove the Skill Injectors, period.
---
They must raise up the cost of citadels, capital ships (2 B full fit for a dread, really ?) so that battleships and sub-caps become viable able.
---
They need to add special ships that small gangs can use to harass coalition-size structures, but I am at lack of ideas. Maybe restore nano tanking (Vagabond style - 2006) ? Too fast to be hit, fast enough to shoot miners and flee before the home defense response team.
---
And they will need luck... and our patience. Because as you say, the risks that the game will be done for after any correction is high now, we can leave... It is already impressive despite the general stagnation and so the boredom, that EVE is still here... in a pre-agony state.
---
Only been suggested for the past 5 years

**This feels like a reaction post**. Clearly meme tier, just like the poster. At least do a youtube video or something, that takes effort.
---
üôè the hero we need
---
Are you sure? According to a diagram I saw, you can train up to 5 mil for free, then inject sp up to 20.5 mil, and finally train the rest as Omega.
---
What about the plex used for the 20 bomber accounts?
---
Blackout was not designed to counter botting.
---
No Other Game has anything like them. We gotta keep em.
---
Please do not criticize my arranged junior FC t1 cruiser 30v30 brawls they are real exciting content thanks
---
its free if u roll it urself
---
That was just a lovely side-effect.
---
I filled the CPU and PG bars because I thought they were health and shield.
---
I've always been the one to learn the hard way...
---
Nope. The basic assumption behind that statement is that people who runs bots for a living just stopped going to work. Would you stop going to work if they started construction along your path to work?
---
It takes a lot out of you, but, to me, it was totally worth it. I put my corp in stasis last month. Been running it for over 10 years, and it sucks to do, but I'm enjoying actually being able to play the game semi-casually now. A lot of my friends have moved on from Eve, or are also on hiatus, so it helps that we have a meetup once/twice a year no matter who all is still playing Eve. We're doing a corp Thanksgiving this year!
---
Ended up being quite a long video this time. As a personal preference Ive always prefered video's in real time so i can see whats going on rather then sped up. I also prefer the game and commentary sound to be louder than the music. Please let me know if this is how you prefer everything to be in little pvp videos like this. Hope you all enjoy cheers.
---
Easier to just, turn local off less dev work.
---
Kikimira, Drekavac, Leshak all have the highest cost to effectiveness ratio, so they're used most commonly. However, if you start looking at other statistics, then the other ships can be useful as well.
---
The Draugur isn't phenomenal; it's better replaced by a Magus for the Skirmish and Armor links. However, the Draugur isn't *bad* either, it's certainly usable. Its price would need to be cut by 33-50% or so before it becomes a good solid ship, I think. As is, the Magus does a better job at booshing for much cheaper.
---
Rodiva and Zarmazd start out below average reps but ramp upwards into ludicrous amounts. The initial rep isn't terrible, but it is inferior to standard logi ship reps. In large fleet battles one would get around this by switching targets, negating most of their usefulness. They can be useful ran with Ikitursas, see bottom of this post.
---
The Vedmak can mount a sizable buffer tank and then absolutely melt its opponent's face, even better if you add in neuts to crush their tank. A fitted brawling Vedmak without bling can often run for less expensive than the average Kikimora. They're still a couple hundred million ISK, I think of them vaguely as a sidegrade from Pirate cruisers. Their benefit is that you may already have Precursor Cruiser V from training into Ikitursas.
---
So the point is, each of the other Triglavian ships aren't *good*, only *usable*. And for the price tag they ask, you're gonna be looking for actively ***good***. 
---
However, this is all leading up into the one big daddy Triglavian ship: the Ikitursa.
---
The Ikitursa is expensive as all hell. It can fit a massive buffer tank (T2 Trig resists are weird, but sexy), spider-tanked with other Ikis, and deal ludicrous dps. The point being, Ikitursas have some of the highest mass efficiency in the game for WHers and quite high individual value for the ship class. Ikitursas are practically made to hunt supercapitals, and with their resists, speed, etc, as long as you primary all webs on the field, no Ikitursas should die in the process. I imagine Ikitursas will also be used with the new Triglavian spooling implants as well for even better whaling.
---
I actually like small gangs as well. But the entire thing has gone too far. The umbrellas cost trillions of isk and require so many people to properly work. Its supposed to be weaker than a couple of people roaming around in rather cheap ships. 
---
Imo, the only things that are broken with capitals is the fact that theyre not used more often. I would very much like to see them being used in real fleet engagements but sadly thats not how it works.
---
But can you point 10 ramjags charging at you in the same time?
---
The jump drive is crucial to the JF. It would be impossible to use in any real way without it.
---
When it come to WHs, honestly dont know enough about them to have an opinion. But I mean if its something thats needed then I would def agree that a solution should be found.
---
I dont think humping ratters is the kind of action ccp is trying to create. I for one find that boring af.
---
What's 07 mean?
---
Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooof.
---
Bots were being drained out, and CCP added blackout to make sure no more leave..?
---
yeah that lovely side effect of the bots just adapting and real players saying fuck this
---
I‚Äôll always remember fondly corm storm with Barky. Take it easy man, you earned it!
---
Great it worked for you, but on average most rolls don't work out, which is why it's expensive (on average)
---
Fuck that. Once per extraction. 
---
Hillmar can just say "something something different section of the moon" 
---
Or more aptly "lol chaos guys!"
---
Yeah but not usually 126km you mongaloid
---
Sorry who is this again?
---
How do?
---
But how can I carry covops and nullifier subsystems on my fleet ships so I can GTFO when we get boson'd
---
No man. Small gangs who have benefitted the most of these changes are like 10% of the games pop, NS is about 40%. Quite frankly, you could have lost all the small gangs and the game would have lost less than what Im seeing today.
---
But my argument has never been to kill any playstyle. In fact I keep repeating that small gang should have CCP made content that allows the to fight small gang. And big gang get changes so we can fight big gang. The assumption is that we always have to have a loser, we can actually all win and honestly, its required cause Eve consists of many playstyles and I will never be in favor of losing any of them.
---
In general, cutting things will cut the playerbase, adding things will probably add players. We need an expansion that adapts the game to 2019, based on the current situation and not on nostalgia. Cause all Im seeing right now is "change things back to 2016 and well have those numbers again". Has that ever worked for anything?
---
So yes, we most def need change. But we need for the company to start listening and to stop blaming the costumers and trying to hurt them. Thats the worst fucking kind of business.
---
Yes I get it. But that equates to not having asset safety on anything and the defenders just moving their stuff, i.e., you wont get loot in any scenario. From an incentive point of the attacker it doesnt matter.
---
Nah there'll be people arguing that all bots moved to hisec and Eve lost 8000 real players.

Its a farce at this point. They are not even thinking anymore.

remove JFs all together tbh, make convoys great again

Holy crap please use an album if you're going to upload 3-4 pictures instead of individual posts

Could just, you know, make a thing that catches and bans botters... or change some mechanics so botting is no longer ideal. 
---
Anytime over the course of 15 years

Anytime CCP
---
The bots in your game can't get reported by players if there's no players left.
---
Command ships getting cynos would be nice.
---
They need a purpose and are tank AF for their sig radius
---
I honestly dont get it either. They dont understand business and they dont understand games. Have no idea how they still have jobs. But I guess its like in any other place, they start to think in a way and then just fire everyone that says anything different until its only a circlejerk of yay-sayers.

medium risk, i fly fast kity ships but its not low risk because i jump blindly into gatecamps and bubbles
---
Defenders moving loot out of a low power citadel would give you the opportunity of interdict them.
---
Well, Sort is worst so...
---
They already have a purpose, command bursts.
---
No it wouldnt. You cant be targeted right away even if you remove tether, just like NPC station undocking. You click one button and you jump out. Its all theoretical, in reality it will only drive players away without anything good coming from it.
---
You're missing the point... They WANT the Cyno ships to get killed. They don't want you landing on the field and immediately lighting up an Indestructible Cyno so your entire Alliance can pour through. Either you protect your Cynos (plural), or you bring enough to keep replacing them when they die, or... you lose.
---
great shot bud
---
For the love of sanity please try and convince them to have this thing not fullscreen/immersive.  There's actually no reason it has to, you can go into the appmanefest, unfuck their theme, go into gameactivity, unfuck their window manager flags, and it not only works just fine but also retains soft button functionality perfectly.
---
Please don't make me have to deodex every version they release just so I can use my fucking back button.

We are talking about humans and a huge population of carebears when local is there for them to feel safe. Prey population was higher and there was a lot of ‚Äúincompetence‚Äù.

I'd love to see tactical BS for the animations alone
---
Flair checks out.
---
Good point. It was all so long ago it's kinda fuzzy.
---
I understand what they want. I also understand the limitations of *getting* what they want. Making it so that everyone has to sub a new account or train an existing alt into a completely different ship class is **stupid**. Especially when there are other fixes available that don't shut off so many facets of gameplay. This is just going to make big groups stronger, pushing the already condensed areas of nullsec further in on themselves.
---
For perspective, I don't fly capital ships and I don't think I ever will. Even I understand that treating the flu with chemotherapy is **stupid**.
---
You may not see it, but this is a massive advantage to anyone on grid first, i.e., the defender in any system under almost any scenario. It also means fights like UALX last year (and countless others) likely would never have happened and less caps are going to die. The Falcon and Widow are the tankiest and they'll last a few seconds in a serious cap escalation scenario. The change *limits* cap escalations making them infinitely harder for the attacker. Cyno jammers, in their current form, are OP like they'll never been before ... and now this. Imagine trying to attack Delve or Esoteria and try to escalate caps. Good luck.
---
Well I doubt he would have the links off grid
---
You can't kill what you can't see..
---
I think this belief that you won't be able tof ield a fleet because the cyno is instantly alpha's is irrational.
---
It just doesn't happen with subcap cynos now.
---
Also, they want cynos dying. Not super win buttons.
---
Not everyone has to sub a new account or training alts into a completely different ship.
---
Sure, but risk is better than incompetence.
---
There should be inherent risk, not inherent safety.
---
The only advantage I see here is that, in large fights like UALX where TIDI is maxed out, the people cynoing in will likely have time to get a majority of their fleet in before the cyno gets killed in TIDI. We shouldn't be letting limitations of the game dictate play though.
---
&gt;I imagine Ikitursas will also be used with the new Triglavian spooling implants as well for even better whaling.
---
No they're fucking garbage.
---
No, not everyone, but I'm willing to bet a large amount of the playerbase will.
---
We were losing dread cynos in seconds, repeatedly.

You know what your right the game should just die of stagnation nothing should be done. That would be best.

Just wait until someone else uses the app to reply with "Please take me off this distro."

WotLK is also when dungeons turned into the idiot AoE-fest that they are today, since the implementation of the Dungeon Finder.

Heroics meant something back in BC (and they tried to dial it back to being semi-challenging in Cataclysm), but the Wrathbabies couldn't stomach it.
---
The more I think about it, the more I would be on-board with a Classic -&gt; BC server.
---
there's an easy solution to that.
---
just fucking ban them.
---
literally every solution to bots that isn't "ban them" is a band aid fix, at best.
---
Except we don't use subcap cynos for major cap escalations.
---
A mountain indeed, and who left that mountain there in the first place?
---
no no, you have it backwards. it's definitely just the bots that quit - they told me over in the thread about the player count going down.
---
So for the price of a dreadnought you can point out that far, but only until you burn it out - assuming it doesn‚Äôt just mwd away because you‚Äôre way too far to web it down.
---
So a super will just warp off, a bs will mjd, anything smaller than that is probably faster than you, and realistically you probably can‚Äôt close the distance enough to hold him before you have to stop overheating. 
---
I‚Äôm ok with this.
---
i'd just whatsapp my boss a picture of the construction and let him know i'll be WFH until they're done.

Hey I could buy it from you for 600m, it's a 100m profit

^ correct.
---
You said a lot and never anything to refute the real OP's point,

**the playerbase has shifted in both demographics and preferred gameplay style, and CCP's going against the direction of that shift. In effect, doubling down on the losses.**

Make your Capital Cyno module dump ships 1,000km away from the cyno.

If you want defenders, make the defenders warp in.

Get out
---
You do now.
---
And also how do you get caps in when there are no caps then?
---
Warp them?
---
And then what incentive is there for a defender to warp in? None. Which means attackers have no reason to attack. Then we have Farming Simulator in Space.
---
Is it limited to just new accounts? All this SP stuff is black magic to me
---
Yea i think you vastly underestimate the number of recons pilots little guy.
---
Asset saftey?
---
"IRL emergencies"? 
---
Ok, Asset Saftey in wormholes and we'll stop.
---
That aside, there should be at least more restrictions on asset saftey than present. I really love the idea of assets pushed into asset Saftey stays in that system. If you want them back you have to anchor a structure to get em. 
---
Man, imagine locking like 100 titans out of a war because you took some fob cap system. That would create some insane content bruv! Sign me up into the first null block who embarks on a great capital liberation crusade.
---
Ive been flying enchanted lachesis for over a year now. Theyre very very strong :)
---
You will now :)
---
/u/BraveNewbean the reason your post was downvoted halfway down page 2 is because all the F1 monkeys who come through wormholes don't want caps to have cynos; just so ya know. Cynos on caps aren't fair! lmao
---
5 seconds later: "well, guess I'll die"
---
Literally the bots didn‚Äôt quit they just adapted
---
The bots are still there and you‚Äôre blindly trying to lie to yourself if you think otherwise, go look.
---
Yes.  The vast majority of people i know that quit we‚Äôre just casual players who didn‚Äôt want eve to become a grind fest to break even in an unbalanced nature
---
if I had a 128km point, I'd ransom people in wormholes.
---
Especially amongst people that have capitals.
---
It's one thing for highsec mission runner to not have recons, but even he might have a cruiser to 5.
---
But also, he doesn't have need for cloaky stuff or a cyno.
---
How so?
---
"When a module cycle is cancelled allow a player to uncancel,"
---
Please stop, Please I know I love this idea but it will never be implemented. Don't give me hope.

it's 1 per account, not limited to age
---
&gt; a serious cap escalation scenario. 
---
These don't really happen often.
---
&gt; less caps are going to die.
---
Possibly. But how many capital lossmails are from these as compared to every other thing capitals die in?
---
I like the video.
---
Have fun and you are good at pvp.
---
Ahh, that makes sense. Don't be too put off though, the first time I tried to run combat sites in a C1 in a Moa I thought it was empty too then suddenly 12 Lachisis landed and wrecked me lol. At first I thought "this is going to happen everytime isn't it?"  It won't happen everytime though, it won't even happen most of the time especially if you choose an entrance that is more than a few jumps from a trade hub, wormholes near trade hubs are bad news for the lifespan of your ship. ;)
---
In a super/titan scenario (a major cap escalation fight), typically fax are used for obvious reasons. In UALX, dreads were used over and over on a titan/super blob. Max tanked Tengu's didn't last long enough. Read my comment above about the massive advantage this gives to a defender.
---
There's at least 10 people *in my corp* that now have to train recons.
---
Everquest does exactly this with their Progression Servers. They usually spin up a couple a year.
---
Why?
---
Are they all moving capitals around alone?
---
don't need to worry about the cyno changes if your faxes are already on grid.
---
So how did the FAX get there?
---
Was he already there? Did he warp in?
---
could you shrink the pic a little more i could still make out some details.
---
These fights happen literally every day in our current TEST vs. Winter Co. war. They happen on every Fortizar/Keepstar attack, which is already cancer with current citadel mechanics. They happen on ihub RFs, Rorq saves vs. dread bombs, etc. etc. The change will simply give defenders one more advantage, and trust me, there's plenty already. It's great for Goons, TEST, NC, FRT. CCP will have almost assured escalations are so difficult, we will all forever hold our current space and just turtle up.
---
I'll take three dozen of these, who do I send the 0.36isk to?
---
There should be an ability to link omega accounts with a discount for additional accounts. 10% of 2nd, 20% of 3rd to 50% of 5th and 50% there after. Such that more linked accounts gets you a deal overall.
---
This. However trying to explain it to someone with a myopic viewpoint is futile.
---
Yeah that's what I got too... :S
---
Any attempts at scarcity need to be accompanied by changes to Rorquals to have literally any effect. Really either one of two changes - they can't mine, or they can't jump.
---
i watched part of a talk from a game developer whose focus was on monetization and micro transactions. Especially on how to maximise the player utilisation of monetised features of the games. Overall the guys attitude was sickening.
---
One key point he made was you need to get players to start spending as soon as possible. Once they have made that initial purchase its easy to convince them later to spend more. One way to do so was to make a deal that was so good any new player would be foolish not to buy in.
---
Every time I see people mention the 1 mil SP for five bucks deal I think of this guy.
---
You know the answer to that, and if you somehow think a brick-tanked Widow has the EHP of a Minokowa, you might wanna pull up pyfa. As I said, which you're not hearing, is that this makes major cap escalations infinitely more difficult in an age where the defender already has major advantages, including OP cyno jammers placed 250km off Keepstars, etc.
---

Hi Grath. How are you? You seem much more relaxed these days. In a weird way, you seem to have just accepted the fate of CCPs bad decisions and don't put up much of a fight about almost anything anymore. It's a bit sad to watch.
---
&gt; And then what incentive is there for a defender to warp in? None.  
---
Explain why that's the case. It's not self-evident for me. Wouldn't defenders warp in to... *defend*? Or whore on some kills? I don't understand why they wouldn't. 
---
What key part have I missed here.
---
And an aside question, when you say 'capital escalation' do you mean specifically cynoing into position, or do you mean more broadly bringing capitals to a fight by any sensible means?
---
&gt; You know the answer to that
---
Do I?
---
You said people don't use subcap cynos.
---
Either you're here lying (ON THE INTERNET!!!) or you're dumb.
---
I'd like to prefer you're just dumb, because that's excusable.
---
I'm asking questions.
---
How did the fax get there if not from a subcap cyno?
---
You do realize when you say its great
---
for goons test NC and frt you just named 95 percent if null population. The remaining 5 percent probably doesn't agree with you.
---
Minmatar are all programmers and the solar panels are legacy engineering. The guy who stuck them on moved out to Jita because the pay was better and everyone is too unnerved by the way that they seem to connect to the self destruct module to try removing them.
---

---
there's no 'a' in mongoloid you ape
---
Hey can I kindly have you isk. Would be much appreciated, thank you!
---
And it might be unicorns as well. But since there is no way to know today nor in a year we have to look at what actually is. If activity drops of hard, which it has, then thats proof. If you wait a year then there is absolutely no way of knowing what caused what.
---
 FUCKING FUCK FUCK SHIT FUCK my phone is too old to install it.
---
&gt; and LS should've been what Eve was about all along. 
---
I agree.  I think there should have been a "middle sec" with concord response on gates and stations to smooth the transition of people into low sec.  Get them used to mechanics like watching local and dscan while mining and missioning while not having to worry about gate camps.  Better new player retention, smoother path out of high sec.
---
When you end up with the right person for that, it's not an issue, but there are a lot of people who are the right person for reasons other than that.
---
The remaining 5 percent won't ever be able to hold major swaths of space (without renting) because this change gives the attackers a huge disadvantage. You think Delve is a fortress now? Anyway, logic isn't working here, so I'll just step away from the computer.
---
Eh?
---
Ok, overheating in a red giant with mindlinked max CS boosts is KIND OF cheating.
---
I've been very patient trying to explain this to you, but with the name calling, I'm done now. Have a good day.
---
I guess I read it completely wrong, so I'll give you a more or less run down. First subcaps fight, then a "soft" cyno lights for the Carriers/faxes, the soft cyno is typically a nullified interceptor/T3C, then a fax lights for dreads to kill the Carriers, then supers are cynoed in to kill dreads via a dread/fax cyno, then titans are cynoed in to supers via capital cyno. That's a very very generic version of events.
---
Perfectly Balanced, 20 people concentrating their efforts against one should pretty much always win
---
A lot of times the first fax/Carrier/dread to jump thru a soft cyno lights a follow up cyno. To the average player they may never see the soft cyno only the capital cyno.
---
Please clap.
---
3/4 of the T3s are still relatively good in some roles and even the ‚Äúbad‚Äù one (Prot) still has uses (fits a better tank than a Lach/Arazu for Anti-booshing)
---
Im killing the drifter as well.
---
&gt;Tapi calling others F1 monkeys
---
Also consider the range of things, its going to be hard to escalate past Carriers to dreads if the cyno is in range and is a subcap. Carriers will alpha it prior to dreads jumping in. Dreads never jump, supers never jump, titans never jump.
---
Is one able to tractor the wreck of someone else outside of High Sec?
---
You're whining about slippery t3s while bosoning gates.  
---
My heart weeps for you.
---
Good on you. I still remember my first time :)
---
Please do. Is I can blow you ship up 100KM away from the fleet and they can not burn in intime.
---
You're just not cultured to the minimal requirements of TAPI
---
Swing and a miss, try again.
---
My heart weeps for your elementary school teachers
---
Imagine your self-esteem and imagination being so bad, that you have to make a Reddit name mocking one Eve's longtime FCs and a CSM member.
---
Tech 1 mining lif
---
The player count was higher back then, just sayin'.
---
I concur, I got quite a few fights in FW were people underestimated the neuting power and got wrecked as a result.
---
Yes clearly the first one in is using a subcap, but that cyno never last more than a few seconds. That is why people use whatever capital that gets in as the follow up cyno. With only subcap cynos no more than a few capitals will get into to attack and the defender will clean them up piece meal.
---
Aye, it‚Äôs p solid against jags and hawks, and a little bling goes a long way.
---
Are those the only 2 options? Either throw shit on the wall and see what sticks or just let it die? There is no middleground here? No way we can actually fix things that doesnt involve just breaking more stuff?
---
See this is the issue dude. I see a vocal minority hailing CCP right now. But your memory of why we are here seems to be flawed. The stagnation we are seing today is CCP made. We have a responsibilty too as players, but people will always pick the easiest path. CCP gave us a reason not to fight, and we didnt fight.
---
This hasnt changed. The things that cause the stagnation are still here. Citadeltimers, fozziesov, fking triple cyno jammers, no reason to fight and so on. All of this is CCP made. And none of it has been fixed. But instead of actually keeping on point said minority wants more changes that will only bring about the exact same thing they want out of the game.
---
Cyno change will make capital fighting harder for the attacker meaning the defender just got a massive boost in SOV defense, the blackout has made tons of players leave NS, removal of asset safety will most likely make it much much harder for the smallest groups to actually live in sov NS. These things will not remove stagnation, they will just make it much much worse.
---
And heres the kicker. You think CCP has somehow all of the sudden become something else, this innovative company that will actually turn all of this around. But what you dont see is that we havent received a new CCP, its just more of the same old one that keeps ignoring the signs and valid critisicm. But you will, issue is that it might have caused too much damage by then.
---
TL:DR Change for the sake of change is only done by people who dont understand what the issues are. But if we know the issues and still refuse to change those factors and instead do everything in our power to make changes around it to somehow try to imitate real change...
---
Yes, you won't be able to tractor yellow wrecks though as they belong to someone else
---
Of course activity drops hard if you make gameplay harder. That is how it has always worked in Eve. It takes time for players to adjust to changes. For example Apocrypha update in 2009 when wormholes were added to game it took several years for people to figure out how to play in WH space.
---
The easiest thing to do is make cynos act like seige, no remote reps and can not be lit during panic/or panic cant be active while cyno is active. It's an easy change that would fix the cyno issues. A ratting super/carrier and mining rorq would have to make the decision to cyno or not to cyno.
---
&gt; Either throw shit on the wall and see what sticks or just let it die? There is no middleground here? No way we can actually fix things that doesnt involve just breaking more stuff?
---
Have you been paying attention to the last decade of CCP development? They are either crippled by indecisiveness, crippled by investing in other projects or slapping shit on the wall to see what sticks. There isn't a middle ground between these states.
---
&gt;Cyno change will make capital fighting harder for the attacker meaning the defender just got a massive boost in SOV defense,
---
Easily solved by removing caps. This can also solve citadel timers because they don't need as agressive of damage caps.
---
&gt;removal of asset safety will most likely make it much much harder for the smallest groups to actually live in sov NS
---
I'm advocating the total removal of asset safety. I advocate for the removal of asset safety once the citadel is in low power mode. And for people who have not logged in since you can just grandfather them in using the old asset safety system. 
---
&gt;Change for the sake of change is only done by people who dont understand what the issues are.
---
This is my position you can't have it and then declare my position as something else.
---
Adapt or die.
---
Problem is, TIDI breaks many things already. To rely on chance isnt the way you want your supercap escalation to go. There is a high probabily of only being able to jump a couple of supers and then the cyno dies. That means you just fed multiple supers. What FC in their right mind would call for another drop after that?
---
That's what I'm asking though, wrecks of someone else that haven't been abandoned. Because in HS if they're blued it's all up for grabs. I would assume it'd be the same outside of HS.
---
Nullsec gets a nerf so wormholes should too, ok that's fair, as soon as wormholes get the 300 or so buffs nullsec has had since wormholes were added of course ;)
---
I remember asking where can I find the overview?
---
Nice humble brag about the Lamborghini
---
Get like 10 of em and nobody will ever escape you again.
---
The bot battle was lost when they introduced Alpha clones.
---
Any f2p game will always be infested with bots, and there's nothing you can do about it.
---
I enjoy sharing it with others more than I enjoy owning it. It‚Äôs mostly used as a way to give cancer patients a bit of joy before they pass more than anything. I live in the Midwest so pretty rare thing in most cases
---
Which hasnt changed. Im saying thats how you fix the game.
---
If you remove caps you will lose tons of players. Thats yet another reduction instead of addition. People seldom bash structures with caps so the damage cap isnt even relevant.
---
You are not advocating or you are advocating? Cause the low power aspect I can get behind. But it wont due much good because in my opinion those should be killed outright with no timers. And people will most likely not store anything of value in them.
---
I dont get it.
---
It is a nice car nonetheless.
---
What's really funny is that Universal Healthcare is already in the game(free clones)
---
Adjusting isnt the same as leaving. WHs were an addition, people could opt into it. These changes are reductions, you just leave instead. Why I keep saying adding things is good, removing is bad.
---
But the argument is that it will somehow make more people play.. No. The game needs to become more casual, not more hardcore. It wont survive it.
---
Thank you for the kind words. If you know someone who is sick in the KCMO area we have a lot of cool super car rides we do for people that are feeling blue.
---
I didn't call you any names.
---
Not did you answer the basic questions.
---
Ah yes, the classic "Sure it's pure cancer that's terrible for the game's longevity, but I had fun for a short while!" that gets upvoted into hundreds.
---
Yay positive feedback! :) Let's keep on being constructive guys :) and by constructive I mean suck CCP's dick :U
---
So then what you can absolutely just put in the Titans and supers on that initial cyno
---
If the cyno lasts long enough to get 1 ship through, then it can get all of them through.
---
There isn't a line or a limit.
---
Eve was totally unique game 16 years ago. And guess what: it still is. There are no other games like it. They have just added too many farmville mechanics lately and players have forgot what makes it special.
---
As much as I agree, reset is something that CCP can always do as a desperate last measure. So there's no point in doing it now when the game is still somehow dragging along.
---
No, you can not.
---
I too would enjoy ~~showing off~~ sharing with others.
---
I remember trying to bring some RL friends into EVE. At some point I completely failed to persuade one of them that there are no "friendlies" in EVE without actual social contact. Somehow he kept thinking that default corps or whatever is green on overview by default reliably means friendlies.
---
weird flex...but ok
---
Actually this is brilliant. with the cyno changes ive been working how to keep my faxes ongrid
---
They can not only be in rep range at all times now, but they can ADD TO MY ISK/HOUR.
---
BRILLIANT
---
Woof
---
CCP has made a concerted effort to make EVE harder and more time intensive. They like the hard core players, and cater to them almost exclusively. I've been playing on and off for 15 years, and that's always been the case. 
---
They seem to think more people will play if you NEED to work together, but the opposite is true. The die-hard players may work together more, but that just makes it even harder for the average Joe with a wife 2 kids and a career to compete.
---
If you want to fix eve you have to walk away from the idea that eve is great because it's so hard core. If I can't have fun playing for an hour or two a few times a month I'm just not going to play. There are far too many other options for my time, many not even gaming.
---
I still get the itch to log on occasionally, but after 2 hours of moving ships, getting ganked in Jita, another hour moving stuff that was lost, hearing about how delicious my tears are when I point out how unfun eve can be, waiting for a fleet for an hour, roaming around trying to find a solo fight and finding nothing... I'm always reminded that my time is much better spent doing something that's actually fun.
---
Except that's not how it actually ends up working. Alliances try to get as many in as they can but never more than a few get through. Once those are in you have whoever managed to get in light a cyno so the rest can get in.
---
Would you prefer I park it up and never bring it out for kids that have cancer?
---
HARD FLEX for kids with cancer...........problems bruh?
---
I do not think they'll have time to work on that until they finish Walking in Station, which I don't think can get done until they re-write the POS code, which they really can't do until they fix capital bump mechanics, and that means first they'll need to correct supercap proliferation.
---
Game must be hard since you are not allowed to undock in the ally nc dock üòÖ
---
Imagine taking reddit serious
---
Making game more casual has been the biggest problem. Plex prices have gone up because it's too easy to farm/bot isk and nullsec has become safer place than highsec. Content creators and FC's have quit because creating pvp content has gotten too hard. Roaming became almost extinct because only handful of people are good enough to avoid getting dropped with caps/supers every time.
---
The more easier it is to go do pvp the better it is for the game. Pvp fuels the economy making stuff explode so you have reason to build new shit.
---
Why can't you?
---
You lit a cyno and got ships in.
---
Why does that magically stop working?
---
Capital warfare isn't that common anyway.
---
You could just light multiple cynos to start with
---
Lol it‚Äôs junk it has like 1/10 of the information that neocom has
---
At least let us look at all the things we can in neocom
---
Look man, go back to your b274 and camp highsec wormholes and pretend that you are a relevant wormhole corp. Capital warfare is common currently.
---
Probably a lot of people. New players and old players.
---
Well I mean if "representing cancer patients" is how you wanna justify it, be my guest.
---
Did you miss the post about bots using pods on gates?
---
Now I feel poor
---
Hahaha.
---
Anton. Anton never changes. 
---
I've unironically been with him since he was in highsec. Great guy, loyal to the end, always hungry for a fight, always looking to generate content, and he's never been phased by any risk. If we were all more like anton we wouldn't have a stagnated nullsec. Sometimes he's just... a touch too creative though. 
---
Anyway, since it's happening regardless, he wanted to get dropped. Like he was legitimently disappointed he wasn't.
---
holy fuck you are conceited
---
It's the same logic behind why mining ore doesn't add ISK to the economy, ratting does add ISK to the economy, and losing ships doesn't remove ISK from the economy. The act of going to Jita or Perimeter and buying 500 PLEX out of 4-4 or TTT results in you getting a month worth of Omega game time, and CCP not getting anything in return. The ISK you spend to get that PLEX goes to another player.
---
Now, SOMEbody had to have sent CCP money to get that 500 PLEX in order to post it to the market, but that's them sending CCP money for their own reasons, not the person buying PLEX off the market to keep their account going. Therefore, PLEXed accounts do not *directly* give CCP money.
---
Ask in car groups then my dude........feel free to ask about Lamborghini Club Missouri and we will be there. Not like we aren't legit or anything just one of us plays EVE Are you pissed about that? Should I post the '86 Grand National as well?
---
And in that case, isnt it balanced that you can buy 20 frigates for the price of a single bomber and those 20 frigates can kill the 20 bombers?
---
I guess I must just play at am off time (8pm mountain) because every time I risk around fw low I find a hand full of players at best and usually they're flying a throw away with no mods...

I specifically bring it out for anyone with cancer. Last one was a fella that was 86 with stage 4. Cancer is lame and fortunately I have the opportunity to give the "last ride". If you know anyone in the KCMO area we do a lot of this for people in the Midwest.
---
Sure, we care about kids with cancer...but thats not what this post is about. theres absolutely no eve context other than a paper sign. This post is about your car. you're quite literally bragging now. nobody here gives a fuck man.
---
I would suggest Anton mine within range of 08... would be happy to drop on him :D

Yikes!  I'd take being normal over being rich and you any day of the week.  Jesus fuck.
---
it does not count, im alpha with 5.8 mil sp all in skills, just right click a skill and apply unused points
---
Not if all the stupid little things like the broken default overview and window positioning or the outdated career missions get fixed. Even if an extra 1% of players were to stay from changes like that, that would have been 6000 new players just this year according to the guy above.
---
Unless there is a dread bomb on grid, the carrier/super/rorq doesn't need remote repair, because the fight is over once the umbrella gets in

Dad's drunk.........I play EVE........I donate a ton of cash per year to early onset cancer patients.........meanwhile you're a dickhead.......again if you know someone in KCMO area.....I'd love to give them a ride. I have an Aventador, not a fucking Keepstar.

You can pretty easily get over 100km point on lach/arazu with links and heat, for 400-500m especially if the fitting stats are bad.

Pretty sure there is a group in EVE that was pumped about cancer patients and had keepstars  etc. I like bringing joy to people even if its not digital, end of story. TY

You can kill a super/rorq with bombers very easily. They would lose it before you lose the fleet.

Contact Lamborghini Missouri for requests for sick kids that like supercars.
---
So you have no explanation?
---
Just personal attacks as if you even know me
---
Capital warfare is, sure.
---
THe kind of capital stuff you're talking about really isn't.
---
Theres one...what? Every few weeks? Since the beginning of june there have been 3 instances of multiple titans dying in a fight. In the same time there have been 8 instances of multiple supers dying. And most of those were with less than 50 people on the kill mails, meaning it wasn't some huge brawl where cynos are being instablapped.
---
Not only are huge capital fights not common, they are an almost negligable amount of super killmails.
---
The idea is that is that the jump drive would be reworked to lead a JF to WH space, then the JF would need to travel from that WH system to its destinaton.
---
Basically, at point B find a WH nearby and drop a beacon in it, JF at point A warps to WH system near point B then has to  manually fly out of the WH and then however many jumps to point B.
---
It would give a larger yet still small window to attempt to gank the JF, Any wise JF pilot would have an escort fleet but this could lead to content. A well planned quick response could potentially roll the exit hole to point B and trap the JF inside WH space. Of course the JF's group can send in a fleet but the more back up they send through the hole the more they contribute to collapsing the exit so its a risk/reward mechanic.
---
You don't, you start catering to the demographic you have by making the game less time intensive. Doesn't mean they need to make 30min matches, it means I shouldn't expect to spend at least 2 hours in game getting ready to spend an hour trying to find a fight that lasts 30s...
---

The more you post the more you prove just how little you know about this game.
---
Oh I get it now.
---
I like the idea but I dont think it would be viable. The amount of extra work it would cause will be an issue from what I see. But I dont know, might even be better than now for all parties.
---
No, I know your corp. So i wouldn't call it a personal attack but a corporate one. I have explained it, this will kill all capital escalation. You pick these out and say "BUT SINCE JUNE," when you look at eve things are done a lot slower than that. Plus the cyno jammer issues came out prior to june so yes there hasnt been a lot of capital warfare and we would like to change that, not double down on it.
---
But in the past if you used that argument to justify supercarriers it wouldn‚Äôt be a good argument?
---
Yet somehow, even with all my incorrect statements, you can't really provide any evidence they're wrong.
---
No
---
This post gave me cancer
---
You can use whatever you want until you get banned for it
---
This is the biggest assumption of them all. That people left the game not for any of the other thousands of reasons but because it became more casual. But the thing is, we dont need to speculate. If youre right then we will have higher PCU in a couple of months. If Im right we wont.
---
But Im telling you, the only reason we even are still in business is because of the casuals. They are the main group in every game. You alienate them and your game is over.
---
Another whiney post... the same people who say " Oh eve comunity is best comunity" jesus...

Then you will get a sweet lambo ride if you‚Äôre in the midwest

Now that sounds like a genuine new player
---
You only know my flair.
---
So of the last 800 Super deaths, going back even further, only 10% were in instances of multiple supers dying. Meaning just 2.
---
It's clear big super battles with capital escalations just aren't happening enough to worry about them over the overall health of the game.
---
Almost sound alike more supers will be dying with this change than without.
---
For how long will that be free...?
---
Hmm... that would maybe be a good one, pay to activate clone whuaaahahahahaaaa
---
Overall health of the game needs advertisements and hype, seems that super fights do that. Not heron kills.

I get that people hate carriers now but it sucks because I spent actual time and effort on it instead of skill injectors. Was always dreaming of flying a nid, and now I barely used it before it became worthless. Thanks autists. A couple of million sp wasted. A year or two, as well.
---
They have icons on overview that correspond to ship sizes. Also higher bounties on then is a good indication they are strong.
---
Sure. But youre forgetting one key aspect, 16 years ago you and me were different than we are today and the world was a different place. You are conveniently forgetting thousands of other aspects that changed during this time and thinking nostalgia will save the game.

It wont. Give me one good example of when regression has ever resultated in anything good.

WHOA GUY LETS NOT TAKE INTERNET SO SERIOUSLY K???
---
But big super fights aren't happening regardless.
---
And this change won't really affect that.
---
The biggest fights in eve history pretty much all involved supers dropping at the same time. Not a significant offensive escalation.
---
When I first started playing Eve my first corps ceo said that Eve is a tactical space submarine simulator. There are not that many casual players in simulator genre...

Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

of course test pilots would see this and think anything other than what it is, a complete bastardization of supers

Tbh all UI bugs are annoying, destroyed targets staying in locked item slots, overview not updating when stuff disappears
---
I‚Äôd literally buy plex for a ‚Äúreload UI‚Äù button to keep from having to dock/undock all characters each time it happened
---
It's just a novel idea really. Yes it causes extra work but it also causes an opportunity for player driven content. I'm not saying this is the change that needs to happen but changes like this could make New Eden a lot more engaging.
---
I do worry about JF's relation to other industrial haulers in that they devalue other hulls by performing better in nearly every aspect. It's similar to how the Rorq outclasses every other mining ship. EVE ships should not be a linear progression to bigger is better. Character (hull) diversity and balance is core to creating an engaging meta for any game.
---
Does your graphics card exist/is it dying?
---
This, it looks like a graphics card problem, and by problem I mean it's dying.
---
It's a fallacy to think you can balance a game like Eve.
---
Changing mechanics in a game isn't always regression. For example they removed neutral logistics from highsec wardecs. That was a good change even if it removed something from the game. Changing things around keeps the game interesting and not stagnant.
---
Drop the cancer thing already, even if you do all this charity work, it‚Äôs pretty classless to even bring it up in this context.
---
Well, tbh he's probably right...
---
The problem is, that capital drops are used in three situtations:
---
1. Hotdropping a single capital, most of the time this happens in lowsec. For these kind of fights you don't need the tank and the changes will not really affect those a lot.
---
2. Spawning your umbrella. I think those are the main reason for the changes, because now you can kill the cyno and maybe some capitals if the umbrella doesn't manage to get a new cyno in place fo reinforcements.
---
3. Capital escalations in big fights. These might be the collateral damage; but any change you make here also affects the outcome of no.2.
---
There is no way to make umbrella cynos different from big capital fight cynos. These changes are targeting the ability for capitals to summon more capitals if things go south, which is a *good* thing.
---
next time you and dad have an outing you should both look up the following words together: tact, humility, grace

Yes and no, this happens on a random ship, meanwhile everything else looks fine

I'd bring up a Keepstar but I don't have one so I figured I'd stick to things that were real rather than another scam.

Thank you for this input, this is spot on and addresses some of the major reasons that lead me start this post in the first place.
---
Butthurt krab spotted.
---
Every solution to bots that is "just ban them" just leads to new bot accounts/characters
---
Point 1 - No
---
Point 2 - Hell no
---
Point 3 - OMGWTFBBQ YES PLEASE
---
Oh it is on the fking test server..... Next!
---
nice try but i know you only want to "give" me "free" healthcare and income so you can take credit for my existence and then later threaten to take it away.  which if I let you have number 3, wouldnt be very difficult to pull off
---
thats the fundamental problem - I need to wait 100 days to try something out and I need to pay for it...
---
thats why this game is hemorrhaging people, old people quitting cause of burn out or whatever but new people who come in, they won't stick around due to this. 
---
Game needs to evolve, but you will always find group of die hard with rose tinted glasses who go: achhtuallly....
---
Botting never is ideal. It's always on a "good enough" base, considering the alternative would be the account being logged out or shipspinning.
---
Why? Input broadcasting is fine up until character selection. Using multiboxing software is not a bannable offense.
---
Can anything?

In 2006 when I joined and died hilariously in a mining stabbed, I was 25, I could play from 6 pm to midnight - each weekday - and often 20 hrs extra over a weekend. It wasn‚Äôt good for my social life, and my girlfriend at the time. But hey - spaceships.
---
I joined LV in null, ended up fighting goons - which was dramatic, exciting - a real ‚Äúenemy‚Äù. I got p.nuch well into this - looking back I realise how much ‚Äúdrama‚Äù there was and how wound up I got (gg goons!).
---
Alliances collapsed and died - great caravans to ‚Äúescape to th other side of bull‚Äù made you feel like the rebel alliance fleeing to the‚Äùouter rim‚Äù. Freighter ops were organised - 50 corp mates spending 4-5 hrs escorting 10 freighters though null - no titans.
---
BoB was around fighting goons - huge drama continued the fight went back and forth. MC turned on BOB - Bob came back Wvil thug hotdropped peeps. Campaigns over systems lasted for what seemed like months.
---
Over time the 6 hrs a day went to 2, I got married got a house, got promoted for junior trainee and over 10 years to senior partner.
---
Now I scrape 30 mins here and there. Fleetnopa are far to long, cyborg based Titan warfare (enjoyed a few of those, and had the pleasure of flying all 4 racia titans on a single character (yes I trained 4 diff skills).
---
All this done on SRP. When there is no means to losing stuff - when I lost my t2 fitted sniper megathron to goons in 9-9 and spent near 2 months mining and moving to fit another one (no srp) - it meant something. Losing a titan and getting it replaced that week felt kind of blank for me.
---
Now I talk to friends - lifelong friends I‚Äôve made - people I visit, I know their kids - we have bbq‚Äôs and beer. We don‚Äôt play the game anymore - we are out - because the time available to play is to short.
---
But the greatest part of eve is the friendships and characters you make and meet. Even enemies I would happily drink beer with now (looking back eve is a game that matures you as it matures). 
---
Eve throws al of us into a melting pot of human and social anxiety played out on a galactic stage. The skills you are forced to learn help you all the time.
---
Without Eve I wouldn‚Äôt have been promoted - I would never have learnt excel to the level I did. Without Eve I wouldn‚Äôt have life long friends from around he world. I would have hardly travelled.
---
The only thing that could save eve would be something dramatic. Something truly crazy. Enabling people to reset and start over would be one options. Force that basic need for working together to occur.
---
you got me.
---
add subtlety and discretion to that list
---
But they can still jump through to hisec...
---
Yeah I usually prefer describing myself to females  as a beta male that likes to be pegged at the bars as well
---
It doesnt take 100 days to train into anything of value. You can train into a battleship within one month of sub.
---
Regardles, for 3 months of sub (40$) or 3 15$ months you'll be able to train MORE than enough to enjoy eve. That's for less than a AAA title rn.
---
&gt; What's 07 mean?

Now [70](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bravenewbies/comments/2893su/what_does_7o_mean/) is really gonna mess with your head.
---
thats some impressive mental gymnastics there.
---
That many were left?
---
I just see a load of lokis. And a tengu doing pve here and there. There may be other playstyles that I never visit. However, a niche role for a modular, versatile platform design is a nerfed concept.
---
just stay in your wh and continue your heron hunting bro.

nothing to see here for you, you‚Äôll not understand anyway.
---
You've never fought a stuka fleet have you?
---
As far as I've understood the subject, input automation is fine, as long as you do not gain an unfair advantage. If you map a voice command to the button 'V', for dscanning with your voice, that should be fine. If you map a voice command to a macro, pressing F1 through F8 with a small interval, that is bannable.

i wonder if the cancer patients you supposedly drive around know about the homophobia... I mean they have the right to know don't they?
---
Have a nice rest massa, me and levi and the torrinos boys say hi.
---
Should buff lock times for BS but add a default penalty % so that stacking scan resolution would lead to the same result. Thus improving solo experieince and keeping fleet where it is.
---
You really dont get the point, right?
---
&gt; Of course, there‚Äôs probably a multitude of reasons why this is a bad idea or just not going to happen, and I‚Äôm sure you will all tell me why.
---
It's purely balancing. You have to balance for basically every combination of subsystems, have industry chains for every subsytem and ship, make the different ships have their own consistency with their race and have them still be meaningful as a ship class.
---
Legion is used as a powerful 100mn platform either with RLML (dunks Frigs/Dessies hard, works decently on Cruisers) or Pulses (Dunks cruisers and works well vs BCs and BS's, less good against Frigs/Dessies unless they are bad and drop to low transversal).
---
It's also used by some groups as an Armour doctrine (Either HAMs with Neuts or RLML in Wolf Rayet Wormholes).
---
You're right tons of homophobia in this post.....any more rebuttals Al Gore?
---
stukas wont apply for shit to SB frigs

Jump in carriers 1000km away, burn fighters in for 5 minutes while other cap dies...

---
someone plays/played osu! :)
---
Weird SJW comment but OK......I presented lots of good we do for the area and you've done nothing but posture on here so there's that.......I'll put my 500k car and good will against your reddit posture in your mom's basement any day.
---
You are correct and wrong at the same time.                  
---
If big part of the new player group actually stayed in game - then yes you don't have to worry about it.           
---
But when new players don't stay and old people quit - hell now you have a serious issue.                  
---
Consider on top of this that most of the people are quitting as eve is already 2nd job and CCP changes only make game more annoying rather than fun.
---
Putting the word **stupid** in bold doesn‚Äôt make it true.
---
weird how you felt the need to do that, almost as if you were worried about people catching wind of what a huge piece of shit you are, but what do i know?  go on keep digging that hole for yourself though, it's interesting to watch
---
shit fit frigs don't need much application.
---
Who said anything about shitfit? Armor punishers have a  solid tank, and their weapons will apply to the bombers.
---
Weird how I'm really not worried about your opinion mate. I won't oppressed by your SJW lifestyle and if you don't like the 1st Amendment I have the 2nd to protect it.
---
Citadels go low power in their final timer.
---
You kinda do if you dont like frigates as pvp machines... you are just assuming that your way is the only right one :-(
---
enough bombs combined with target painters melts everything
---
if you have 4,5m in skills + 500k unallocated,
---
you can't train anymore. 
---
if those 500k are not redeemed yet, you can train.
---
What's stopping you from warping the carrier in?
---
I think this is the part I'm missing. 
---
Is it just the fear of warping into bubbles, and not being within FAX range?
---
How about CCP add cynos to faxes? You still don't get the "save me button" on carriers/supers/titans, but getting a masterrace fax on grid as a hard cyno could be an option?
---
Scarcity is not a bad thing in a game.          
---
But people are not quitting over this idea but about changes CCP did.               
---
* Blackout - if people wanted to live in space without local ... they would move to WH space long ago ^(guess what no one did)          
---
* Drifters - CCP decided to fuck you with the OP mechanic. Nothing like a fleet of ships spawning on top of you or force you do do even more chores in game already considered 2nd job                    
---
* Cyno Changes - hell you can do stuff like before - all you need is alt with a recon. More accounts yay!  ^(like seriously WTF)         
---
Now this is more funny when you consider that real issue is in :             
---
* Injectors ^(CCP is milking people for years and all what we get is 1/0 changes on a database level)                
---
* 'Excavators' ^(like you can delete them)            
---
* ISK flooding into the system : remove blue loot, give 50% reduction on the ticks when you rat in a capital sized ship , **PUT SOME WORK AND INTRODUCE ISK SINKS**                 
---
People are mad, CCP say 'we don't care if people rage quit' ... people quit ... CCP finance team is shocked.
---
yea what's there to be worried about? who is worried?  oh and yea, cool, you were government property for a time, good for you lad
---
EVE online, not EVE portal, but I just downloaded portal and will check it out
---
Rarely do I find selfless service to be a problem........again...........you're welcome for my service
---
You‚Äôd bring up a keepstar in relation to your Lambo...that doesn‚Äôt even make sense.
---
Better at RL ISK vs in game? I mean I could shelter myself and be eccentric
---
maybe you should add selfless to your list too, cus i dont think you know what that means. in fact, just pick up the dictionary and start reading, and dont worry if those 2 brain cells of yours get tired, hang in there buddy you can grow a brain yet
---
:condi:
---
Haha, once again, wtf!?
---
*cries in pool of bricked modules*
---
How do you get the number? Even with 37km Base and heat and Arazu and Proteus boost i don‚Äôt get that number ?
---
Join as an Infantryman, go to the Kunar River Valley, then come talk to me about selfless service, or if you're too much of a bitch to do it IRL just watch the documentary Restrepo
---
Are there still people who think this abyssal shite was a good idea?
---
o7
---
Enough bombs indeed, but you wont get more than 7 off.
---
Nice Lambo dude! Also r/Eve hivemind please rain those negas here too! &lt;3 :'D
---
Not fear of bubbles, no. But the bubbles would stop you getting on grid and helping the cyno ship. Out of fax range, no, since the fax would be in the bubbles with you.
---
So the only option would be to launch your fighters and hope they burn to the cyno in time to dps down the attacking ships before the cyno ship dies, as it wont get fax reps.
---
Yes, and minerals are free if you mined them yourself.
---
Looking at the post, I thought you were just ostentatious.
---
Reading your comments, I realise you're a *massive* lolcow.
---
i wouldnt disclose my military record to anyone if I was really concerned about being selfless. what a disgrace to anyone who wore a uniform for truly honorable reasons than to brag to a bunch of civilians, disgusting
---
TY mate! We do a lot of charity work in the area but sadly I'm the only only EVE player so I try to use the profile to bring people to the game!
---
&gt;if ccp focused on creating real  pvp opportunities for content in the small, cheap, new ship level.
---
Player retention problem, yeah.
---
OP is a POS, I grant, but none of what he said there was homophobic. Classless, tasteless, tactless, sure, but not homophobic.
---
1. OP never claimed it could do 7.5k dps
---
2. OP is pretty close. Each rattle does ~1.3k with perfect skills + 1.5k rorq = ~6.7k dps. Realistically more like 6k - 6.3k dps probably but still more than 5 nestors would ever do no matter how blinged.
---
Only way this works is if you have a titan on the undock if the KS with 10 Scimis or Oneiros to be bridged IMMEDIATELY a cyno is lit.
---
They can then hopefully get on grid with cyno ship and start repping while capital response is forming
---
So someone, incorrectly, calls you a homophobe and your response is to get massively defensive, call him an SJW, and brag about how much you care for the BOR.
---
Christ, can you be any more of a stereotype?
---
Don't. You have at least a semblance of humility, which makes you richer than the OP will ever be.
---
Nothing to be ashamed of bud. I can wear it with pride, even on the internet so there is that. If you really hate yourself that much then that's your problem but I'm quite proud of my accomplishments and the willingness to share them with others.
---
r/JustBootThings
---
TFW you mjd and are still in long point range
---
Eve is very very broken currently, just give its some time so they fix it... maybe it happens before the release of starcitizen
---
I'll be right there with some on-site IT support if you tell me what system you're in
---
i dont know, im kinda 50/50 on whether that was an attempt at an insult or not, dont really care either way
---
&gt;But the bubbles would stop you getting on grid and helping the cyno ship. Out of fax range, no, since the fax would be in the bubbles with you.
---
If you land 1,000km off the cyno, why are you in a bubble? 
---
That literally makes no sense.
---
C6 red giant give stupid number when overheating. but you can't keep your OH more than few cycles before everything burn
---
Security status is a good general indicator. The lower the number, the tougher the rats. Also, if you're doing industrial or mining missions then I have a decent Tayra fit I can send your way.
---
you can try to tell people your vanity is pride all you want, but unfortunately most people have more than 2 brains cells which puts you at a disadvantage, doesnt it?
---
Surely for it to be an insult it would have to be insulting, right?
---
It just came across as pathetic.
---
Pretty sure if your 5yr old brother was withering away you‚Äôd have a different tone.
---
Because the attacking gang would put bubbles around the cyno ship, thus if you warp in from your 1000km jump-in you'll land in one of the bubbles
---

---
lol 33
---
Lol says the guy that only uses an Enyo in game........what a fucking loser
---
Yep, I just wish they would hurry up and give Hilmar his millions of dollars bonus so if can fuck off sooner.
---
I was looking for this comment :D
---
I'm sure.
---
Is that supposed to be insulting or something?
---
what even the hell is that supposed to mean? you think I havent lost someone close in my life or something?  maybe i have, and I just refuse to use that as leverage against someone in an argument, because you know someone bothered to explain to me what integrity was, and sorry they didnt teach you that in the army or what ever the fuck hole you crawled out of
---
Good luck targetting and melting 20 frigates before they ruin 20 bombers. Not to mention the bombers would have to focus fire whilst the frigates can just pick a bomber and melt it.
---
So, ban them.
---
Think he's referring to the fact you have 42 in fleet and there's only 15 enemies on your overview.
---
As long as the input doesn't do more than 1 keystroke you should be fine.
---
Now that you've edited the post, so you *are* saying that you won't warp in to help a bro unless you are in FAX range. 
---
That sounds like a you problem, and not a problem with the mechanics.
---
Well seeing as how I wasn‚Äôt implicitly invoking a response from whatever sespool you crawled out of I don‚Äôt see how this post of me and my dad having a good time or even my possessions has anything to do with you. Perhaps you‚Äôre just a total piece of shit that lives in moms basement whereas I‚Äôve demonstrated more than reddit acumen IRL through a simple prank on my pops who has clearly had too much tonight
---
Anyone have same issue? I turn the app, few sec of loading and then popup:
---
Unsupported Texture Format
---
Cooked Flavors: ASTC
---
Supported: ETC1,ETCP,VRTC
---
And app crashes
---
My favorite ship. Always got fights, and they were usually good.
---
Average EVE age checks out
---
There's a shitload of content right now in null. So many anomaly runners to kill for non consensual pvp. After that the locals might rally to fight you. The main thing is to fly nano since then you can choose your fights.
---
Next to be evicted so yes
---
No. If the jumo in at 1000km is in random spread around cyno, then nobody jumping in is going to be in range of anyone... Let alone a fax
---
There is a list of compatible phones also, if your phone isn't on that list you won't be able to install it either. Which is currently my problem
---
DOW 2 wasnt it`?
---
You just want cheap faction mods back.

right because after 6 replies, you figured, the best way to not invoke any more responses from me, was to... reply yet again. brilliant strategy, but we expect no less from you, the hero of this story. i dont know what the hell reddit acumen is, but im sure if we shine a black light on you tomorrow  we'll see plenty of it strewn about the place, you're right about that
---
For the love of everything that is holy I hope you're right. We're in desperate need of an eviction. Please, come save us from our addiction to this game.
---
Imagine if this was a Korean game and you only had like a 2% chance to get it above 90%
---
Shine your black light on me then. I welcome it. Looking forward to the proceeds that spring forth. In the mean....I‚Äôll have you know that you‚Äôll find the real McCoy
---
I just thought the meme format was funny, wasn't trying to make a loud statement. I hadn't actually seen this meme until today. If CCP did indeed introduce blackout to hurt bots, it seems to be a poorly executed and rushed method. But I've really enjoyed blackout. I like solo/small gang stuff. 2 sides to every coin. But I'll get downvoted regardless. Oh well.
---
The nergal is pretty op in Burner missions
---
Story? UI bug or lag is my guess.
---
well that is the problem with insulting stupid people isn't it? i think all we'll find is some idiot with his dick in his hand, which is what im about to leave you with right now
---
Ah yes the way out of keyboard warrior conversation. Shame your mom didn‚Äôt quit while she was ahead too....
---
Or we can't be arsed because we don't play the cool dank memes games with the kids. But accidentally one gets wound up when you select one and use it. Kids these days.
---
I really don't like the sound of what you seem to be proposing. Some sort of instanced PVP between 2 similarly sized gangs? Do we just ship spin in station, sitting in a queue waiting for arenas? Seems like a poor suggestion. If that's not what you're implying I'd be curious what you think would work to provide small gangs an organic method to seek out other small gangs. As it stands now, poking the nest usually gets a quick response which works just as well for me. But mega-blocs and donuts make for 100v10 situation. Don't get me wrong, I love fighting outnumbered, it's part of what makes it so rewarding and so reliant on individual player skill. But the fun of small gang is you dont need to rally a hundred dudes just to go out and poke some shit. In those cases you undock with 10 buddies and shoot whatever you find. Doesn't that sound like a net good for the player who might only have an hour or 2 to play?
---
Then you warp to the cyno. The FAXes warp to the cyno. You land in bubbles. They land in bubbles. 
---
Oh, you've edited the post already. 
---
A dictor bubble is 40km from one side to the other. An Apostle's optimal range is 54km. It can rep anything in the same bubble as it with full effectiveness. 
---
Alternatively, and this might actually require use of braincells from the fleet, is that you warp to a perch, *then* warp to the cyno, so that you're all deliberately landing in the same bubble together. 
---
The meta would adapt. It has before, and it will again.

if i was THAT close before mjb, it means i have all utility to murder\\neut tackle

They did it for nullsec stations
---
Yeah the issue was CCP being retarded.
---
Kisaki Studios have taken thousands of models to eve china fanfest before, these guys have been wanting to sell them for ages and ages but CCP are retarded.
---
Or just add new sorting that would show only columns affected by abyssal similar to compare tool.
---
I had to chuckle
---
Adding &lt;&gt; filters for module stats like CPU, PG, ROF, etc (plus module type filter) would be a really useful addition to the hangar but especially  when looking for the right abyssal mod
---
Do NOT trust him! Look he even shows as snuff!
---
(Dude are you trying to get us deployed again?! Shush! Don't give mom and dad any ideas!)

And this means anything?

Its only like that if you follow the guides. I usually don‚Äôt do that, only flying the ships I like with fits that suit my playstyle, no matter what anyone else says. 
---
Try it out - It‚Äôs really works!

what are you talking about this guy is super inspiring

Just get a new bf at that point tbh.

Yeah cool is probably my fav t1 cruiser besides the vexor.

What phone?

---
if it doesnt shit on my family but will bring about the apocalypse  then I wouldnt vote yea. It s called, you wouldn t know, having a personal thought and a bit of foresight.
---
&gt;Until the "stack anyone breathing under a single umbrella and make them Rorqual mine as much as possible" became the only model that's significantly ahead of others, Eve politics were much more balanced.
---
Do you mean in the era when several large groups controlled nearly all the moon goo they could just AFK extract from moons protected by a super/cap/titan fleet without jump fatigue?
---
You ran on a platform that made me believe you would be against AFK ISK generation. Can you please explain why AFK extracting billions from moons (in the previous iteration) is ok while AFK VNI spinning isn't?
---
The idea of more resource scarcity is interesting but comes with a big caveat regarding the actual implementation and balance.
---
People having 2 hours queues for WoW to login into the laggy experience and you guys keep complaining that "Eve is dead" and all is bad. Stop whining and Give CCP some credit :D
---
isk is never a balancing factor
---
Iphone 6 here, shows up fine. Installing now. Ill update if i get it all working :)
---
Tbh I still don't know why people like those green stuffs over the nice t2 thingies after playing 2 months
---
honestly you can't kill stukas with 20 frigs, they are just so damn tanky and if they only have a single boosher or two you won't even get into a range you can apply to them while they shred through your frigs, I can tell from personal experience that 80 jackdaws is not enough to alpha through the tank of a stuka boosher if they do it right and with only like 3 or 4 logis on their fleet, a command dessie or two and 15 bombers congrats on trying to kill anything, you'll just die in a ball of fire to bombs
---
20 frigates per bomber btw
---
 that would actually be a good idea. fuck stabs
---
And that's your opinion
---
apparently yes. it's like lootboxes but much worse
---
How cool would it be if that if you set your autopilot before you un-dock that the station will un-dock you aligned w/ the gate you are trying to reach.
---
They break even after firing for 350 seconds at a single target: https://funkyimg.com/i/2WxjH.jpg
---
They might be usable in some narrow set of cases on other ships, but definitely not on ikitursa.
---
you can get a lot more than that if you tech 1 fit them.
---
&gt;remove blue loot
---
lol ok remove bounties and mining too
---
Thanks!
---
what per volley? did you forget the boosher who starts to cycle on time with the bomb drop to avoid you burning into them?
---
Don't worry, I'm sure Hilmar will give him some sp soon for T2s
---
New damavik (after CCP added resist bonus) with some bling is one of the best frigates for 1x1 fights - it's very hard to counter due to sheer neuting power and decent mwd speed.
---
On this case it‚Äôs skirm link + mindlink + c5 RG
---
just because someone on twitch (or the internet in general) does something does not mean it is not against the rules of the game.
---
if i remember the EULA blurb correct, 1 keypress = 1 action. doesnt matter if its from some gamepad or macro keys on a keyboard or a voice thingy.
---
Just wait until you see my mining Arazu! It will be getting mining and tank boosts, already getting perma reps and show I have a cyno ready to go!
---
Maybe even throw on tackle range bonus just for shits and giggles.
---
that's the entire idea behind passive moon mining: not needing 10k warm bodies
---
Nice Fake
---
They take Hubble pics as inspiration for them, so no they do not exist in these shapes in RL, but in principle this is what Hubble pics look like in spectral augmented filters. Though it is not what we would see with the human eye ...
---
20 bombers dont include CD's
---
Thats true, but the limit he is talking about is that injected/unallocated SP counts towards the free 5mil SP. So if you have 4.5mil trained and 0.5 mil SP sitting unallocated then you stop training cause you've hit the 5mil max.
---
The only way around that would be to have the free SP sitting in your item redemption queue until you hit 5mil from actual training (just be careful it doesn't expire on you).
---
If you've alread hit the 5mil max then all the free SP is just extra gravy.

Yeah, but those sometimes are when they are evacuating.

Fair, I hadn't actually done the math on Kostenanza implants
---
I was at the charity dinner last year (2018) at Fanfest.
---
I was at CCP Hilmar's table.
---
He was flying in a wormhole corp. 
---
A player run corp. Not a CCP one. 
---
Obviously they couldn't and didn't know who he was. He specifically called out that he couldn't join their voice comms, for obvious reasons. I told him he was lucky they hadn't Awox'd him yet. That day he learnt a new word.
---
And told some good stories about his adventures. He even had the star struck look of a noob flying his first ship into a WH when he told the story.
---
They do play the game. So give them a little credit.
---
Take away NPC-Strations in Hisec, and thus reliable and trustworthy bases for the 70% of EVEs population at least that just runs missions or mines &amp; builds in Hisec, and you can close down this server. NO, your PLEX-trading mess in Perimeter will never be able to replace NPC-Stations ...

Damavik is still shit, as in, it'll eat shit to any number of pirate frigates that can fit into novice plexes.
---
Target painters are stacking penalized you goddamn baboon
---
Procurer. Train for that and the magic 14 skills first. Then the only things you need usually worry about are the ones with a diamond before their names or the precursor types of super rats (Trilgavian &amp; Drifter) they just added recently.
---
Then of course depending where you are you may or may not be in violation of CODE, the ministers of Miniluv or just other pirates passing by. Better check that privilege and license. #Desuganku is a thing.
---
Seriously though... grinding the very outdated totem pole of NPC rep is not a very effective. You may want to figure out other means to an end. Outside of anomic burner missions the rest of the higher end income options won't have you going for copy paste dialogue with an NPC picture in a station dock.
---
Meh it gets the point across...
---
they still have an effect your clown
---
I started losing st EVE at 21, started winning at 27. I loved my time with the game but I couldn't keep up with the time demands of PvP nullblock life. I was working more and more overtime IRL, so I tried supplementing the lack of commitment with PLEX. One day I got really baked and had a good talk with myself about how sustainable this all is.
---
It was either turncoat on my friends and join a bearblock or press the delete key. I chose the latter, because the only ship in my hangar worth saving was friendship.
---
Garmur is the only one which you cannot fight at all out of your list. Another one is cruor which also wrecks damavik if it has decent fit.
---
Blingy tank solves issues with worm and even some destroyers (my damavik tanks 250 dps vs uniform before heat, 316 with - without asklepian; with asklepian it's even higher).
---
Succubus' cap gets owned by a-type neuts if it stays within scram range and cannot kill damavik if it's kiting.
---
Unlike other ships, damavik is less likely to die to various range control + TD ships which are quite abundant in FW, so you can invest extra ISK into it without fear to die in a fight vs random 50m frig.
---
The game and nullsec in general especially needs more fights like this. I very much enjoy seeing fights at this scale happening in nullsec; great to see.
---
&gt; Maybe a system that requires more skills for bigger things, that are exponentially harder to achieve would be good
---
EVE already does this, the level V skills take much longer to train.
---
&gt; I feel that there is too much doom and gloom
---
Stop reading /r/eve and you'll be fine.
---
Not really OP, for the ones where you use a Daredevil atm (Angel, Sansha, Gurista), the Nergal isn't faster, for the Serpentis and Blood Raider Burner it rocks. Haven't done the math for team burners yet.
---
why are you using EMP against armor cruisers? or is my small af phone screen deceiving me 
---
nice vid anyways  ballsy taking on a maller considering 99% of them are bait :P
---
I'm hesitant to believe you, but will give you benefit of the doubt. 
---
I'm quite curious as to your fit. I'm not necessarily suggesting you give away trade secrets like that, I'm just surprised that you managed to make a Damavik functional. I tried blinging the Damavik and Nergal to see if they shone there, but my fits failed. Were you able to fit any Entropic Radiation sinks, or just all lows to tank? What type of ammo do you use?
---
blackout or no blackout didn't matter much for most of us who do mostly pvp. Some regions are more dead than others, small gang hit and run and fleetfights still happen. You find now less targets who doing pve but as you said be in a enemy staging and poke them always gives you a response.
---
Played 2-4h per day beside last week. Got Around 500 kills, lost 4 ships. I run mostly with fleets and boost them.
---
Feel that all to well. Now I have a FW character for the pvp and a explorer character to keep him well funded.
---
get away from /r/eve 
---
Few years ago I was doom and gloom, Eve was dying etc. Stepped away from /r/Eve and even the forums for a bit and just played the game. Boy was I surprised when I actually enjoyed the game when I was playing it.
---
Ahh cheers did not know that
---
It's just a small minority of salty 1337 pvpers who want to kill capitals with 1 bomber.
---
Just downvote and move on.
---
Yeah im not to good with what ammo to use against diff armour types and ships, I mainly just use ammo in ralation to the range i want to fight at. Definately something i  need to improve on. Yeah was worried bout the whole bait thing being a maller
---
Sounds like a good idea for the new era of chaos
---
you can use a single nergal for several burners which if you are poor might be an advantage
---
if you are unsure just use Phased Plasma vs everything and load EMP/Fusion when you think you can snipe a resist hole
---
&gt; not needing 10k warm bodies
---
Just a large superfleet instead. Olmeca's entire argument and agenda is 'make it how it used to be where me and my friends we're kings for only one days work'
---
spreadsheets are king REEEEEEEEEEE!
---
Awesome cheers for the advice man.
---
Hmmm, wait, aren't there many people in China who (scientifically false) believe that chinese are not homo sapiens sapiens but homo erectus descendants and thus a superior race over all of the rest of the world?

Too bad a study of the University of Shanghai that should have proven this proved the exact opposite XD ...

I wish I was one three three seven :(
---
All you have to do is get some vaccines and become a turbo autist

As others have said, completely ignore most of the posts in this sub and you'll be fine. Game is awesome, it could be better of course and that's why people complain A LOT, but it doesn't make it less fun to play.
---
See you in space o7
---
The nergal is faster in the most Burner missions (Check out the guide here https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ctkvno/update_burner_mission_guide/ ) unbeatable is the Daredevil agains the Succubus/Dramiel/Worm and the Garmur against the Hawk. And from my perspective, I haven't flown the daredevil burner so fast ever before.
---
Salt&amp;Tears are from 70-80% of PvE population. Opinions about great changes come from pvp neckbeards. As they broke ingame chat long time ago it still working like the first day of upgrade. Low effort changes are  discouraging  old players, and another wave might come as soon as they remake cyno.
---
We are mainly masochists. We whine about TIDI, supercap proliferation, ship balance, skill injectors and CCP in generan. But in the meantime we would alarm clock and take a personal day at work just to be in another UALX or X47 or any other 4h+ TIDI slugfest, where you can go to the bathroom and you still haven't locked up the last broadcast.

Fit has been lost by me and casper24 quite a few times already, so it's not a secret. I've had a bad run due to playing tired and falling into various traps, casper had a much better run (he died only once due to playing bad - to Enyo):

Fitting any damage mods goes against damavik's advantage - neuts. Neuts need time to work, to have that time you need all the tank you can fit.
---
AB helps to control range but high neuting power lets you to ignore any kind of range control within scram range. If your neuts can reach it - it will be dry, so you have option to fit mwd which lets you be more flexible. AB only fit dies to quite many kiters.
---
Base fit is the following:

[Damavik, 5MN neuts]

p1: better rep to be able to fight various high-dps ships (with ~300-500m rep you can fight coercers)
---
p2: lower pg to fit 2nd a-type to be able to fight expensive scram kiters better
---
p3: cheapish longer range scram (you have CPU for that, helps vs kiters)
---
p4: mwd - not very important, but higher speed helps vs kiters, lower sig lets you to fight arty thrashers, as in facetank while they have cap and then reduce their dps when they are dry
---
p5: neuts - might be quite important upgrade but they are always expensive, so i'd stick to deadspace

You are NOT prepared!  
---
PHASE 1: Triglavian invasion:  
---
Stage 1: BlackOut.  
---
Stage 2: CynoOut.   
---
Stage 3: **TitanOut** (Capitals nerfed to the ground in order to calm the "blah blah too many capitals, blah blah they are too powerful, blah blah we dropped by avatar in delve HALP!" whines. Now you need one person/account per titan\`s every active module (including guns)to fly one)  
---
Stage 4: **MinerOut** (Use new kinect-shovel to decide how much your venture/hulk/mackinaw/rorq extracts per cycle.  T3 miner/exhumer laser blueprints drop from triglavian capitals and stack amount of ore they extract per cycle... and don\`t need kinect-shovel...).  
---
Stage 5: **TriglavianOut** (Flying triglavian ships converts all menus into shiny triangle language... Triglavians attack and capture SOV systems under sansha and blood raiders, roll out their own carriers, titans and have huge murder boner for drifters + capsuleers if latter ones decide to intervene).
---
Next stage: Drifter Invasion!  
---
Stage 1: **GateOut** (Gates aren\`t working, manual fuel block feed required and travel is possible thanks to black holes (Hard Knocks and WH corps that got used to people fearing to get evicted by them are gonna love it) with solid chance of having C5 and C4 entrances to high sec!)  
---
Stage 2: **AthanorOut** (Drifters furiously kill athanors/sotyos and mine minerals themselves. On place of destroyed athanors - their own edition of athanor with lots of mining goes up, destroying these gives you advanced blueprints and badge "Drifting miner" buuut summons drifter fleet behaving like capsuleers).
---
Stage 3: **FAXOut** (Faxes can only repair subcaps,  attempt to repair armor ends up in shield damage and vice versa.)  
---
Stage 4: **FreightOut** (Drifters analyze freighter routes and leave anomalies near spots and stations that destroy  random 5% of freighter\`s cargo each 5 minutes AFK\`d in those anomalies. Normal ships get their modules shutting down from overheat in seconds instead of cargo loss).  
---
Stage 5: **CapsuleerOut** (All drifter ships carry warp disruptors and webifiers, loot player\`s wrecks. Slowly adapt their doctrines and counter % of player PvP roams with fleets matching DPS and tank numbers.   Drifters capture SOV and expand, manufacture ships and mine resources and construct their own capitals and actively attack high sec and its concord. They have their stations, loot and blueprints that drop, the best loot is in their original home systems... there is also also a rumor of Artemis Tyrannos in charge wearing attractive pink cat keyhole bra but last person knowing where it is located and how to get it ended up dead from 2 drifter DDs...).
---
Thanks for backing my post exactly, cause thats what I said, DD still better on Sansha (Succubus)/Angel(Dramiel)/Gurista(Worm). So its better in 3 of 5 (60 %) of the solo burners. Nergal rocks against the Daredevil (Serpentis) and the Cruor (BloodRaider).
---
I've literally never camped a wormhole.
---
Wow, what a great position!
---
No actual information, just personal attacks!
---
I like that you can fly the enyo burner and jaguar burner without any issue, you dont even need to kill the logistics on the field
---
yea, im used to losing ships, the only part i hate is flying around doing shopping because i cant buy everything in one place most of the time, but i guess its part of learning process
---
Its weird you think seeing somebody else happy is sad.  See a doctor.
---
You mean the free lvl 5 skill or 100k sp mission pocket thing?
---
I have a compatibly phone, but also, apks can't be limited by phone type.
---
At most they can have issues with processer architecture, but the phone they listed are all ARM, which is most common anyway.
---
Bravo Ovidiu, asta-i atitudinea :) (in the off-chance i nailed it :))) )  
---
Yea, just stay away from r/eve is a good advice, especially at start. And look for and join a good corp of like-minded people that have the same resources as you. Also play the game for the fun of it and try not to turn it into a job.   
---
What I mean if you go out mining or ratting or pvp-ing, the issue should be less "do I make enough to plex" but more "how much better am I today than yesterday". That saved me a lot of headache. Welcome to the game.
---
Just chew through the 500m EHP komodo 4head
---
I've been asking in the discord (my phone and computer just tell me the thing doesn't exist) but no one will take the 5 minutes to extract and upload the apk...
---
Probably..  Orange
---
Not when he targetting range damps you
---
You nailed it :)
---
Didnt know brave lived in a C5-C6 Red Giant
---
This x10, though it can backfire if you engage t2 ships and don't know their resist profiles well.
---
agree on this, also i think goons have more interest in eve surviving, innovations and investments from CCP than CCP themselves. I think Test/Pandafam etc. also want CCP to set their agenda to eve and not mobile games or failure projects and 4 devs for eve. Spaghetti code etc. ccp had the money from eve and never invested that back. Its like a government where the persons before did all infrastructure etc. and then the follow ups dont do shit it take some years but then shit hits the fans.
---
What is this fitted to? I'm guessing from the cloak and the damp that it's an Arazu.
---
So you've basically used the most extreme module you could find, on the most reasonably accessible ship that gives the largest bonus to that specific function of that specific module in order to make a shitpost about balance.
---
Seriously? Have rabble rousing shitposts about the state of EVE gotten this low effort?
---
I am aware of this part of eve, obviously. I was thinking that skills for higher level activities, like flying ships that do not exist yet in the game, that are bigger that Titan, should be way harder to train. Something like 10.000.000 SP for level 1 and the usual exponential curve for all the next levels. Maybe 10.000.000 is too much... 5 million may be better... but if the game is 10 years old, it seems reasonable to have a skill branch that takes 1-2 years to unlock for any player in the game.
---
Na, the legwork is the burden of the attacker.
---
You n me both...
---
&lt;3!
---
Not a phone hardware/software architect so I didn't know that, also, I'm bad with phones anyway
---
It‚Äôs 16 years almost
---
You mix up timelines, what you say ended 2013 with Phoebe Jumprange/Fatigue patch. PL lost nearly all its Lowsec Moons at that time. Lifeblood Moonmining patch came late 2017. 
---
It maybe just coincidence that exactly during that timespan EVE had the most logged in accounts and was considered the healthiest state of EVE ever (tiericide patches 2012/13 helped too, making f.e. T1 Cruiser Gangs a huge thing again that time).
---
Wow that looks terrifying, thank god I live in nullsec and ccp teleports all of my assets around lowsec if anyone manages to stay awake for 2 weeks of timers
---
Mess? I thought it's been quite profitable
---
Haha TDSIN days. Holy shit. Yeah, still got the ducks and I've grown pretty bitter about EVE. I don't read jokes and humor well real life, let alone online. Not an excuse to be mean to an old friend, but yeah, I'm kind of a grumpy asshole now.
---
Thanks, this I learned today.
---
you dumb f***s, stop shitting up timelines, "Kings of Lowsec" ended in 2013, everybody with a brain could have Lowsec-R64 after that. 
---
And in fact 2013-2017 (until Citadels &amp; Lifeblood) was the most healthy period of EVE with most subbed Accounts and Logins (Weekend avg 55-60 thousand).
---
No, you're being dishonest.
---
I answered every one of these questions for you like a week ago. The fact you're asking them again means you're either stupid, or not arguing I'm good faith.
---
yep but the main problem is when this happens in nullsec/lowsec the big blocks would evict a lot of people. Question is how many players would quit? How many new Players would this attract? 
---
Before Asset Safety you would never lose your assets in the station just the access but you could still firesale the shit.
---
Wow 126km \*-\*
---
Imagine thinking that after 2013 lowsec moons were owned by 'everybody with a brain' instead of the reality we got right up until the moon mining changes.
---
Or, could it possibly be, that your answer isn't satisfactory?
---
Dow 1 &gt; Dow 2 &gt; Dow 3 see the pattern? ^^
---
I am sure, thats why its a mess (to the EVE economy and the playerbase as a whole)
---
Morning falcon !
---
It's only inadaquate if it doesn't fit your agenda.
---
Here's two or three more people telling you the exact same shit I did, and you're still being a dickhead about it.
---
Eve catered to carebears are changed the game to please wow players. Realizing that changed ultimately doomed the game, they are back peddling hard AF trying to get the game back on its core design. This mean the wow players (makes up a large chunk of the population) who are in eve are raging thus spewing shit on r/eve. 
---
This is why you get true eve players loving the game and whatever you want to categorize the others players hating it. 
---
Best advice is to tone out the cancer Eve players and focus and the core mechanics.
---
It's actually a disadvantage because it's a lot slower.  Works nicely in a game like Elite Dangerous though, if you don't have enough buttons on your joystick or remembering them all is a pain in the bum.
---
No matter how hard you cry, you're not getting your FAX cynos anymore. Enjoy. :)
---
Id like to add that you should be able to jump to any cyni within range, not just fleet or even blue. Imagine lighting a save cyno only to have the enemy drop a dreadbomb instead.
---
nobody cares
---
I think you need to see a doctor. Happiness is forbidden. Get back to the spod, you have exceeded your permitted smiling allowance.
---
the smart ones start some tools and see the ships they want to fly and all those skills needed for them to fit it properly are years away wont play the game either if reset.
---
It still caters to carebears.  Buying Plex is carebearish.  Skill injectors are carebearish.  Both of these things are still possible.  Things like Blackout are just arm-waving.  The core game was ruined by the desire for revenue as are most things in gaming.
---
damn falcon for once i have to agree with you, i don't like this feeling MAKE IT GO AWAY!
---
I remember the day when technetium was a monopolized resource, and with the old system you can extract a finite amount per day.
---
I quit 0.0 a lot time ago, but if I recall correctly ratting and mining site are a "infinite" respawnable resource. Would it be beneficial if you could have a fixed ammount of stuff per day in each system? Or even per week. Like one big mining site, but once is done you have to move, once you finished the resources in your territory you will have to stare at your neighborhood.
---
Maybe this is hard since this stuff resets at downtime, but you have at least a limit.
---
upvoted to counter his downvotes!
---
Imagine posting for something you had no part in or information on lmfao.
---
Your point is... long.
---
Buying plex isn‚Äôt carebearish. Unless you‚Äôre suggesting that plex was bought from a carebear which isn‚Äôt 100% true. Depending what time of the game we are talking about.
---
Skill injectors are carebearish and shouldn‚Äôt have ever been introduced ti the game.
---
Blackout and arm waving? I don‚Äôt get what you‚Äôre trying to say. Blackout is a good thing as it was damn near impossible to catch players and bots due to intel programs.
---
Core game was ruined by CCP investing everything into nullsec and big battles. Things that is what drove the game and let them shit on everyone elses play style. WH been fucked over, LS been fucked over, HS been fucked over (unless youre a carebear) and null sec was giving everything to become ridiculously wealthy and safe with little risk.
---
than i'll prob lose ,my 424 ship and call it a day i guess
---
I don't know how much - PG you rolled on Abyssals, but the base fit you posted nothing Abyssal all lv5 skills is 9.12% over maximum power grid
---
MFW profit and making isk = a mess to the economy...
---
I don't think about 3
---
&gt;There is no way to make umbrella cynos different from big capital fight cynos. 
---
Take cynos off krabbing ships (carriers, rorqs, supers, whatever) and the ships that save krabbing ships (faxes), but leave them on dreads, which don't krab particularly well, except in wormholes, where you can't light a cyno anyway.
---
They are making a big part of the game collateral damage.  It's pretty fucking stupid.
---
adapt or die
---
As a new player, my biggest drawback is that I would not pay over $60 per year for a game.  Eve Online is over $130 per year making it an extremely expensive game especially given alternatives that are more economical.
---
Is that what goons do when they post about eve?
---
Sad to see this great corp go.  o7
---
Should we update this with WoWs line having a queue of people waiting to get on the line.
---
They'll never be able to field enough capitals to hold sov anyway, so who cares about them?
---
t3 is what we have.
---
Respect dude
---
Dude, that is one seriously beautiful station :-).
---
This is just an everyday low class loot pi√±ata. Why is this post worthy? It was probably even left low power.
---
&gt;If you want defenders, make the defenders warp in.
---
Bubbles man. Supercaps align insanely slow, especially when they are bumping off each other after jumping in. You can't really warp a super fleet around and not get bubbled all the time.
---
This is non-abyssal fit and it, well, fits. Abyssals are merely an improvement to it, but it can function as-is.
---
Horde or Goons. Which one are you by chance?
---
The whole point is that you can't get a hard unkillable cyno easily anymore. Once a FAX (or rorqual) cyno goes up the grid is instantly won by the defenders unless you have a triple digit sized fleet. They get *at least* 10 minutes of cyno uptime, allowing them to slowly form whatever is needed with zero urgency.
---
It might suck if this is your usual content, but meh. Live with it or go to highsec. There are valid concerns about the cyno changes, but not being able to have a 50k ehp/s tank cyno (or one on your ratting carrier) is not one of them lmao.
---
Prob down to the 1 second ticks, if Eve thinks you‚Äôll be in range in the next tick you‚Äôll be able to activate a scram at range.
---
So you're saying they have a titan alt but don't have cruiser 5?
---
It simply caught my eye on zKillboard as I said... I never claimed to have any part or further information on it why does that matter?

&gt; Chase things that go 5km/second or cloak for 10 hours straight.

You forgot the things that can instant align and warp while being nullified.
---
Certainly something I don't see very often, that's why I posted it.
---
You'd cyno in a full tank phoenix rather than a full tank apostle to be your unkillable cyno in that case.
---
Yes we're so superior and intellectual.
---
Seriously I think that's a cancerous meme, stop being smug, let people enjoy things and don't define yourself by what video game you waste your time in lmao.
---
I‚Äôm a journeyman. I‚Äôm interested in WH life currently.
---
Yeah, this community is very split between PvP "extremists" and mega krabs. The sooner we accept that both are playstyles that need attention from the Devs and proper balancing the better.
---
I suppose not everyone cares, no.
---
If only u have paid a yearly subscription and then game company fucks you in the ass. How would you feel?
---
Im now free from this depressing, buged game. Himlar can now remove asset safty, remake wormhole rolling mechanics and do everything he wants.
---
Golden ammo will fix the game soon.
---
Does it not list the destination?
---
To be fair there are already tools to hide information that some streamers already use (parts of their overview has like a mosiac blur, etc).
---
No, it doesn't. It's just a small reply bar that doesn't say anything.
---
*autistic head jerk and intense stare*
---
Tell me how supers that land 1,000km apart are going to bump? I *really* want to see you reason your way through that one. Did you not read the whole comment before making a contextless quote of it?
---
Look at you big man with 500 mil and 3 rf points to spare.
---
Which are all irrelevant until they are actually playing, they are drawn in by false advertisement, this game plays nothing like advertised and you wouldn't know it until you tried it.
---
The Sell: Epic space battles, zooming around, EXPLOSIONS!
---
The Reality: hours and hours of boring gameplay with that other stuff sorta going on but either you can't see it or it's moving at 5fps in 10% tidi
---
People tell people to join a corp and find friends as soon as possible for a reason, the game itself is pretty boring, the people and encounters with them make it fun.
---
I mean, I don't understand what CCP doesn't just remove cynos from anoms.  It seems like that fixes the actual problem without changing fleet fights at all.
---
But whatever. If you insist on making it absolutely impossible to hard cyno under any circumstances, it's going to cost us fleet fights, and all the players who stay subbed for them.  If you think that's reasonable, then I guess it is what it is.
---
You only have to fly faster than it, plus they're having to heat the point, let alone any mwd/injector to try keep up. Arazu aren't particularly fast iirc. And should it instead go stationary and cyno anything else in, they start a *long* ways off and you'll get out of range faster.
---
I would *love* that. 
---
In any case, out of the box thinking like this is what should be happening.
---
Pando
---
Get the ravens. HK think they are big fish again.
---
Your definition of `very easily` is very dishonest. You'd need almost 100 bombers to break a well fit rorqual. 
---
Not all of us are in nullblocs where 100 man fleets are the norm. EVE is a game where there are many different playstyles, which up until recently were all equally viable.
---

I realize this is bait. I know it is. But I still want to say please dont reproduce....
---
To me there is no game like this. I‚Äôm not even interested in 99% of multiplayer games anymore since they are targeted to people who watch the Big Bang Theory where they don‚Äôt have to have a brain. 
---
Quibbles over temporary mechanic changes made to tweak things and can be rolled back shouldn‚Äôt kill a game like this. But then again I have only played a year so I guess idk a lot comparatively. 
---
Guess we can all go buy fortnite season passes when everyone leaves this game since that is the only type of multiplayer game being developed basically.
---
That‚Äôs going to be a feature enhancement request then.
---
But you raise a good point because this is an important distinction. It -may be- that CCP thought: well, if this is a corp mail and you respond, you‚Äôre going to respond to the corp as well, whereas you may have only wanted to respond to the original sender.
---
Thanks for pointing that out so that other people may avoid that gaffe!
---
You‚Äôre a bro!
---
&gt;Did you not read the whole comment before making a contextless quote of it?
---
Pretty much, yeah.
---
I've been responding to different varieties of these shit tier ideas for weeks now, and I just don't have the energy to carefully read them all through anymore.
---
Bubbles are still the big issue anyway.
---
Somehow you managed to make triglavian ships look cute to me lol
---
Me, too. My friends that weren't interested in that role.. not so much.
---
Why can't you just jump through a cyno quickly?
---
nah, its just 20 disposable Alts on the 20 Rorq-Accounts of a single guy
---
Sure, the same talking point that avoid basic logic and encourages personal attacks and doesn't line up with objective fact.
---
But we don't need to get meta.
---
Can you stay on topic please?
---
&gt;I just don't have the energy to carefully read them all through anymore.
---
But how will you know which are shit tier, and which are not if you don't carefully read them? Regardless, if you're suffering burnout, take a break. Not worth the cost to your mental health.
---
Bye, Felicia

---
As the creator of the corp it's ultimately your choice, but I'm curious - was there any reason why you wouldn't simply elect a new acting CEO in your absence? Surely a corp with that much tenure has some dedicated players just like yourself who wouldn't want to branch out into other corps.
---
Sounds like to me, that you need to find a community and not a game. Dude, I was in serious need of the same thing. If you want some info on where you might feel like you can have some fun pm me or just hit us up on our discord https://discord.gg/eeCX7ch or go to dredditisrecruiting.com and we could hit it off. I was in the same state for years... literally years but found a home with these guys. Not only do they game together but they also find time to hold events to meet each other out of game to become closer than just "gaming bros"... anyways... If interested, hmu via PM or join our discord. we'd be more than happy to help you find a new perspective when it comes to an "online gaming community".
---
I'll have you know /u/Mavev5 is one of the goon elites. Rumour has it he killed 5 ships in a *week*
---
True, but we dont want that
---
I'm burnt out on trying to defend my favorite way of playing the game from people hell bent on destroying it.
---
But whatever.
---
Back to your point, you can't warp a superfleet into a fight from random places because the superfleet already on grid is going to be bubble fucking themselves to catch discos.  The ball of bubbles in these sites is huge in some cases. You'll end up with your fleet spread over a couple of hundred km.
---
The only other thing you could do is try to ping, but then you are bumping.
---
&gt;But how will you know which are shit tier, and which are not if you don't carefully read them?
---
Because they are all iterations of the same shit tier ideas. Warp to grid, jump faster, and occasionally bring more subcaps.
---
No real reason to be sad, actually. Despite the complaining on this subreddit (populated by bittervits, a not insignificant portion of which don't actually even play the game anymore). The game isn't going to go anywhere, if the changes thrown into the game for "CHAOS" don't have the effect CCP wanted they can be rolled back or changed. The recent cyno stuff even has me cautiously optimistic; CCP put something out, people pointed out it's weird and kinda dumb (for JF's to use covops cyno's) and alters the plans. If you'd said CCP was doing a big change like that a year ago everyone would've laughed at you since historically CCP doesn't iterate on things, let alone reshape the plans before launch based on feedback.
---
Don't let a minority stating the game is now dead make you think it actually is. Even if a good portion of the existing (nullsec) playerbase *does* leave, EVE will continue and the players within will adapt. Nullsec isn't all of eve, those complaining don't hold the ultimate power in whether EVE lives.
---
and overheat in a C5 redgiant :p
---
Dont know if my mobile fitting app is just fucked then. It probably is, I've had some problems with it before. Lol
---
It's not gonna die anytime soon, don't listen to the doom and gloom of the forums; those are just angry customers, everyone has them.
---
Tbh, idk what you're trying to suggest we do instead. You think we should all just continue to pay for and play a game that the Developers are making less and less fun to do so by the hour?
---
It's not personal insults, it's statement of fact. You are either (1) a complete fucking idiot incapable of understanding some basic concepts, or (2) you are not arguing in good faith, and are instead trying to advance your agenda.
---
Either way, get fucked.
---
I agree that this dude you're replying to is a bit overboard. But thinking any change CCP makes is "temporary" just shows you haven't been around long.
---
The number of soon‚Ñ¢ changes, fixes, balances, features we've been promised again and again over the years that just get put off while ccp throws money at now-failed projects and churns out login events? They're not going to inspire confidence in vets as a whole, regardless of what they say or do these days.
---
Honestly they should just make it a permanent daily, weekly, monthly.
---
It would drive logins, and it would give people a taste for extra sp which might well help drive sales.  The extra sp for sp farmers would drive down injector prices though so that might be bad.. Could it be made unextractable?
---
That was a long time ago wasnt it? Things change man. Not saying we can ever break WoW numbers but we can def get more people than we currently have. Most of the issues we have with that isnt that people arent trying the game, its just a clusterfuck to get into.
---
I love that so many ideas that were seeded 3-5 years ago are now back on the table, like this one.
---
- redistributing moon goo 
---
- delaying local either by secstat or distance to Yulai (CONCORD lore), up to no local in -1.0 (risk vs. reward reestablished)
---
- Structures to cut down local delay in Sov (for a not to low price/upkeep)
---
- no cynos on Capitals (although in my personal opinion next patch is 1 step too far)
---
etc.
---
Just because you pay (or paid) a subscription doesn't mean the game or its developers need to cater specifically to you or exclude you from negative effects of balancing if things get out of hand.
---
Golden ammo can never exist in EVE and you, CCP and everyone who knows anything about the game know that. CCP tried expensive MTX before and it backfired hard even though there was zero mechanical benefit.
---
It's so easy. Why don't we do that now?
---
Because it doesn't work.
---
Cool man.
---
Ye but I mean those that arent fueled. I dont even like that small citas take more than direct kills.
---
Or put an alt into the attacker‚Äôs to get your stuff back.
---
2019 EVE is heaps easier than Vanilla WoW.
---
That's what r/Eve is, shit posts.
---
No, you create a price differential which gives value to reprocessing
---
UI bug on SISI, had fought this guy, lost, warped away to a keepstar on grid and still had this up. One of my most treasured pictures.
---
It works for me.
---
&gt; People rarely fight over moons now. It wasn‚Äôt the content driver POS‚Äôs were.
---
If that Structure would yield me the moon goo, I dont care if its a POS or an Athanor. I would attack it. but as I get Herpes,Diarrhea and Cramps simultaneously from mining just 10 minutes, there is no point for me in attacking moons anymore. So its not the structure but the functionality that keeps people from shredding Athanors at the same rate as they did with Monnmining POS.
---
The game was also new back then. It's been what 16 years out?
---
Passionate devs that actually play the game
---
As a new player the skill points are the main reason I've quit this game 3 times over the past 10 years without ever making it to a 2nd month of subscription. I restarted recently a fresh because they were handing out 1 mil friend request skill points and it was more than my previous account had on him. This time around I've definitely sunk more hours in but the waiting for skillpoints before taking part in things I would enjoy, such as basic pvp, is still something that's pushing me away pretty damn quickly. The only thing keeping me going is grinding for injectors as at least if I picture the injectors as a player time invested progression system I can be less annoyed at how boring, dumb and dated a time-gated progression system that isn't affected by your interaction in the game and play time really is.
---
Eve's great.
---
It's an absolutely unbelievable concept. So amazing that the regularly-shit execution by ccp still allows eve to be great.
---
However, how slowly they have addressed issues (balance, fixes, bugs, qol, everything) over the years is most of, imo, what creates bittervets. And it's not the only great game around. 
---
We've had lots of big changes to keep things fresh in the past. They caused the same outcry you see these days. Fewer people quit each time than it sounds like. But, at the same time, CCP reacting too late to try to spice things up or balance things out again and again over time has taken a toll on player counts, and it's taken a toll on the mindset od many of the players left behind.
---
Etc.
---
What Im proposing is that the 10 man gang finds content closer to them (something CCP has to create) so they dont have to go to NS. If they choose to go to NS they shouldnt bitch about a superumbrella. Cause those arent cheap and theyre not really there to fight the small gang but will be used against them if you tackle something you shouldnt.
---
The issue here is that you are presenting the small gang as something benign when all these nerfs are here to serve you. But you are completely omitting the fact that big gangs fight big gangs and its hell of a lot different fighting a small gang roam than it is a stuka fleet.
---
Any sort of balance between small gang and big gang will result in big gang nerfs simply because the small gang cant compete. And here we are.
---

You just defined the current Rorqual-AFK-Multibox-Netflix&amp;Chill Meta, thx.

oh god the irony of you claiming to have foresight hurts hahahahahahahah
---
Don't sweat it. The vast majority of the players in EVE Online are in hisec and never go on r/eve, forums, or anywhere else. They happily mine/incursion/mission run/industry away regardless of how fast the sky is falling. This is a few years out of date, but if anything, I bet the % of hisec players is higher now than it was before.
---
https://imgur.com/a/KOdub
---
Half of nullsec players could quit (and possibly have) and it wouldn't matter. Hell, CCP is probably trying to get nullsec to not only quit, but also stop posting about EVE since we scare away players like you.
---
Why do morons like you seem persistant that this time-gated progression makes the game any colder or harder than another game? Eve is a fucking EASY game mechanically. The hardest part about eve is warping in and warping out. Everything else is waiting.

This is a question best suited to our [No question is too stupid thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ctx62l/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread_august/)
---
For me, and maybe players like me, there is always something to achieve no matter my personal skills: The power of my space nation and maybe my corporation within that political system. I don't play a lot when TEST is doing fine without me, I tend to play when things a shifting around and my ship might actually make a difference in the grand scheme of things. What CCP needs to do, for me it least, is keep the sandbox moving, they are clearly trying that right now so I couldn't be more happy.
---
Yup, definitely not personal attacks.
---
you: thing
---
me: I doubt that
---
you: YOU'RE A FUCKING IDIOT
---
&gt;Such a shame that the people who made this game great are abandoning it.
---
Most of them left years ago. At least, most of the people that made my eve great.
---
They're around, either to chat to or doing out of client eve stuff. They aren't in game any more though.
---
Welp, the whole corp knows about his syphilis now
---
No they don't.
---
In the last 3 whole months only 3 instances of multiple titans dying and 8 instances of multiple supers dying have happened.
---
Of the last 800 super killmails, only 10% were in connection to a battle in which 2 or more super died.
---
I dunno man, I just got the 2 week trial way back when that was a thing, no articles read or trailers seen. Game felt like shit, but I could tell there was something about it. Now, if the game keeps getting polished it can at least not feel like garbage and keep maybe a couple hundred newbies a month. That'd be enough to stop bleeding players at least.
---
As for joining the corp and the base game being trash... That's every sandbox game ever really. Most blatant examples that come to mind are VRchat, gmod and Minecraft, and there's hundreds of others to look at. All of them are fairly bland or simplistic, and VRchat barely qualifies as a game, yet all of them are or were popular for significant lengths of time.
---
Luckily number 3 is the rarest of those by a long shot.
---
bro since when the fuck do linemembers know anything other than the narrative told to them by their leadership?
---
&gt;Nobody even wants to do them
---
Oh you'd be surprised...
---
You can also consider increasing your scan resolution. It won't decrease your cloaking delay, but it will decrease your locking time. Sensor boosters, signal amplifiers, targeting subcontroller rigs and implants can all help.
---
There would be a new sport of dropping 20 supers on jump freighter cynos to try to bump them
---
Used to be true though a decade ago. How the times change...
---
No worries man I'm just glad we sorted it out. 
---
But yeah man I hear you. I finally understand all those bittervets who would say "they've made the game too easy/safe and everyone is a carebear".
---
Hilmar has said some interesting things lately so hopefully EVE returns to being the place I go to raise my cortisol.
---
Plus think of how often someone lights the cyno in the wrong fleet. This would negate that.
---
Spool up shield and armor resist debuff.
---
You are still able to jump through holes if you are pointed or scrammed.
---
You are still unsubbing right ? Very hard to read your already difficult posts now that you like to change text sizes.
---
Don't worry bro, we all like to whine about the game to leave, and we may check out from time to time. But most of us will probably never leave for good. Don't think you'd get rid of bitter vets that easy, no sir!
---
You sound salty.
---
My other game is Hearthstone.
---
IMO it was irony. Just "look at the size of my point"
---
&gt;can be rolled back
---
we're 40ish days into the blackout.  there is no sign, not even the merest hint, of a rollback.  And we're heading back to school, which IIRC (and I may not) makes for a lull in number of players logging in until around Christmas time.  Looking at the MERs - and I'm far, far from an economist or a statistician - only shows that economic activity of most types is in the toilet (after a mere 40 days) and CCP's hand is ready to flush.  This is a pretty bleak outlook if you dislike the changes.
---
 You're right, the changes can be rolled back.  However, CCP made a unilateral decision to fundamentally alter the game in very drastic ways.  Some players will like it, some won't.  The ones who do not and have unsubbed have likely either made a simple value choice or a simple moral choice.  Either they have decided that the game isn't fun for them anymore and who pays for a game that's not fun or they unsub to show their dislike of the changes.  Perhaps both.  The real problem is that the ones who do like the change and stick around have less content, fewer targets, poorer hunting, whatever.  How long until they, too, decide that the game isn't fun anymore so why am I playing and paying for a game that's not fun?  I mean, there will be those that stick around, but will it be enough to keep the lights on?  Will they entice enough new players to join \*and stay\*?
---
CCP is playing an immense game of chicken with the player base.  I'm interested to see who flinches first.
---
blah blah blah... I wanna boosh drones/kill ratters multiboxing 12 toons... gons drop capitals on me... grrr gon... please nerf them... blackout and no cyno not enough and I still need more nerfs... btw I hate nullsec alliances... nullsec'ers should multibox 50 toons like me and my buddy.
---
and HAHAHA take that gons while I push multiboxing 12 command dessie agenda on CSM.
---
While valid playstyles, neither the "PvP extremists" or the "mega krabs" seem to understand or actually be playing "EVE Online". I've always played somewhere in the middle - a miner/industrialist who PvP/griefs, and I've never run out of fun or content.
---
I'm all for non-AFK gameplay. Making rorqs have fighter mechanics instead of drone ones sounds like a decent idea to me. But imo any AFK ISK making mechanic is wrong. Even if it is on alliance level. So I would like to see that amount of activity to return without the AFK income.
---
Stick around.
---
The game is changing soon.
---
There will be new blood and some of the old blood will come back.
---
People who had no place in EVE but were here by artificial means (injectors, safety mechanisms) will be leaving.
---
Hahahaha, is that not just a self-fulfilling prophecy? Bro?
---
That was just stupid to begin with man, should have never worked like that. That was fixing a loophole, an exploit. You cant compare that to removing local or changing cynos. 
---
Im all for balance but not for regression. Eve is stagnant because CCP hasnt released a decent expansion in years, no other game would have survived for so long without new content. You know this yourself. Im not saying we as players dont have a responsibility, it is a sandbox after all. 
---
But at the end of the day every gaming company needs to add stuff to their game to keep it fresh. CCP hasnt done that and they havent fixed what was broken either. They have just wasted years on trigs and abyssals even though a lot of people complained, just like they are now. 
---
3 years and the fking Rorq is still OP, 3 fking years man. Me and you are perhaps on different sides of this particular argument, but you are still someone who plays a game I very much like. And we both want the same thing, we just view how to get there a bit differently which is fine honestly. 
---
But, at the end of the day we are both getting fucked by the devs. They havent fixed a balance issue (the Rorq) in 3 years. Other gaming companies would have done that in a matter of weeks. HS is still fked which is why retention rates suck. Tiericide is badly needed but nope. Fozziesov, nope. Citadels, nope. The list goes on.
---
These things arent the fault of NS man. I get it, its nice to have someone to blame and NS hasnt always played nice so perhaps we deserve shit. So give us shit, but please remember that the issues we have are due to CCPs lack of actually maintaining the game. 
---
And our concerns regarding these changes are not because we are risk-averse krabs but rather real concerns based on our knowledge of where we live. We know what certain changes will do because well, it affects us. I wouldnt be arguing against these changes if I for one second belived they would work. But I know they wont, I wish it would honestly, but the issues are far bigger than can be fixed by pulling a switch.
---
&gt;If proliferation is a problem
---
It's not. The problem is supers are too good and as a result everyone wants (needs) to have them.
---
Fucking rekt this dude, Falcon. I, for one, love this picture and it has inspired me to get my own 100km+ point Arazu
---
I might be overboard for someone who plex account from market.
---
As a customer i demand a reiable, predictable product. Not a roller coaster with dramatically falling population.
---
You have a point here, bug fixing or fixing broken game mechanics take CCP around year or two to fix.
---
Thats because the crayon eaters that came before did the math for you.  Even the Marines can learn how to count if you give them enough fingers and toes to work with.
---
Bots will take over normal players. Chinese are ready to flood TQ.
---
My favourite way of playing Eve got destroyed three years ago. I, and I assume many others, are currently seeing a tiny glimmer of hope that we might get back what we had. If you can understand *why* we're doing what we're doing, I hope that you won't hold it against us.
---
For as much as CCP seems to talk about new player retention, I'd say at least as big of a problem for then is content creator retention.
---
Eve isn't a new mmo. It can't lure in and retain new players starting now and experience a revival like a new, fresh game can on day 1. Eve needs CEOs and FCs and streamers and people who maintain useful 3rd party stuff like zkill and eve uni wiki and wh apps, etc. It'll be a lot harder to lure in and develop new folks like that, who keep hundreds and thousands of others interested in the game, than it should be to retain then (or suck ones who quit back in), imo.
---
Combined with the easy to replace them. Cap umbrellas can lose a super and its replaced way to easy. Ccp claims they never intended it to be that way.
---
Don't visit reddit as often, it's filled with crybabies and all they do is complain. Just play the game and enjoy it, there's a lot of people having a lot of fun , me included. I came back after 2.5yr break just because of the new changes and I fell in love with eve all over again
---
 Least this is just a randoms shitpost, CCP's shitposts end up as dev blogs........
---
Find your place in Eve and have fun doing it.  Don't sweat what goes on here.
---
What was the ‚Äúmoment?‚Äù
---
Im with you. There is a big gap. 
---
I would certainly agree on this to be true in most cases but the way I see logistics is that its a massively boring chore that simply needs to get done. Its just one of those things that I feel should be as easy as possible to accomplish because without it the game breaks and making it harder wont really benefit both sides if you know what I mean? One side is already bored by it, making it worse for them so another side can have more fun.. You know?
---
But I do like the idea of super WHs. That would certainly be interesting if WHs could be more integrated with k-space to allow for crazy shit to happen. And it would make the map much smaller which is something we really need. Maybe the ability for capitol systems to generate big ass WHs once a day or something. Imagine sitting their Rorq mining and all of the sudden you have a full fleet on you.
---
&gt; The real problem is that the ones who do like the change and stick around have less content, fewer targets, poorer hunting, whatever. How long until they, too, decide that the game isn't fun anymore so why am I playing and paying for a game that's not fun?
---
This is what concerns me. New Eden was a small universe back when we had 2-3x the players we do now. Now so much space is so dead, empty systems as far as you can travel, systems where you see folks but they're just docked up and afk, etc.
---
It's a real snowball problem. As folks quit, it generally leaves the game less interesting for those who remain even if they disagreed with opinions of the quitters.
---
Falcon, I'mma need you to stop good posting right now. This sub is for shitposting only!
---
Not sure how blackout stops bots.
---
They can be paid for in one hour and rat non stop.
---
yeah imo it's too much in some regions to the point it's jarring. But then again I'd prefer to get rid of them entirely.  I wish they made them optional but I think atm they have it in their heads the clients should have 'consistent looks' or something.
---
I know.       
---
Like he started to play ... and due to this we got PI reworked, even if player addressed this as serious issue for years.
---
Your post was very informative.
---
TBH I liked that JF change initially - sure it rattled the cages of known midpoints etc, but allowed better flexibility in getting a stealth route, cynoing under enemy warp inhibitors, etc. I don't see why they had to change it tho - we couldve easily had both.
---
I wish super capital ships would cost more resources.
---
&gt; Buying plex isn‚Äôt carebearish
---
Sure it is.  It's Pay-to-win.  
---
&gt; it was damn near impossible to catch players and bots due to intel programs
---
Give it a few months.  They'll adapt (already seen threads whining about gate pods).  Back to square 1, hey?

&gt; CCP investing everything into nullsec and big battles

They didn't did they.  I mean apart from Upwell, the place to put your Plex paid for skill injected Titan pilots.

Get it?

Can I have your stuff?
---
How will we cyno in hundreds of cheap frigates and bombers to easily kill titans then?
---
Mm NS is about 40% of the game? Its holding retention rates up and also stands for the marketing aspects so I wouldnt just shrug it off.
---
And hey dude, if CCP actually iterates I dont think we will have issues. And I have seen them do quick changes before launching something before, doesnt mean that they will actually reiterate anything. Feels like people are giving CCP a bit too much cred just because everyone wants to believe what theyre saying.
---
I agree that the playerbase has shifted, but I don't see that CCP is actually working against that direction. Give me an example!
---
I'm of the opinion that it definitely was. If you want to put the time and effort in you can get modules to tailor a ship to your needs. It could be the module that means you live and the other oke dies. It's not like these things are cheap.
---
They already did.
---
Welcome back to your station.
---
This one is different though. I agree, people ree way too much and one shouldnt get stuck on that. But this one is different, its created massive tensions on a level I have never seen on this sub.
---
Low effort? Seems like a lot of effort just to make a shit post to me.
---
My corp got super active since the start of Chaos era. Communities within eve live and die all the time. Find one that is active.
---
I will not extend my sub with those changes ... but as i bought a year i still have bigger part of the year.
---
I mean, I've explained all of this to you, I've linked videos, killmails, battlereports.  I've made every effort here.
---
You don't ask for clarification, you don't make counterpoints, you don't provide any sort of evidence to support your arguments, or disprove mine, you simply ask the same questions again because you don't like the answer.
---
You're a fucking idiot, and at this point, that's not a personal attack, that's simply what you've proven.
---
Plot twist: it's meant for popular games
---
There's basically two EVE curves. The "my alliance does the stuff for me" and the "I have to figure stuff out/do it for my alliance's grunts" curves.
---
Ok so you write big stuff and no solution relevant inside that proove that you lack a lot of knowledge about Eve. Well, that s why at least init hasnt support your application for csm after 1 hour speaking with you.
---
One of rare solution you propose is the scarity of resdource. It s stupid as fuck. For you the big pb is mainly goon and turtle gameplay. Scarity of ressource will give a huge, huge boost to condi. They are atm the only alliance doing special fleet to mine all the moon in 1 day in querious under umbrella that moove with it. If needed they will do it in Period basis , fountain, suerious, cloud ring without a single problem. Peraps tapi will figure out.
---
I hope, as a csm, you will propose clever stuff in the future.
---
The BO, while not a bad idea at the begining, have no effect in creating more pvp (isk destroy is the same , ccp stats), and is outkilling small entities in null, and nuking the numbers of player active (-10%, someone show a clever graph about it). What a bad butterfly effect.
---
I guess. I'm not sure the difference is a flat-out matter of "it's worse this time" though. I think it may be more clear what is upsetting people, compared to how citadels anf injectors were much bigger changes but that have a more indirect effect on many, many more things ... so you get a less clear tension/division on those matters.
---
Problem is that all people that want them can inject into them instantly and not train for 3 years.
---
Those, you could unironically cyno in 1000K away, and ping around defensive bubbles.
---
They should have never had the mining ability to begin with.
---
Replace BPO with BPC in your statement and I'm voting it up with both hands
---
CCP once checked their data, they found out their retention rate is fucking low here https://kotaku.com/eve-online-developers-discuss-ways-to-stop-new-players-1835909279. And this graph did not improve :P.
---
it cost a bit to process the minerals
---
Use cargo fitted BO.
---
As a PL member and responsible for quiet a large amount of moons I also enjoyed this time the most.
---
So basically, you admitted your idea was dumb and shouldn't be implemented
---
No, the best fix is to revert all cyno changes and just make cynos unable to fit on any Capital class vessels or larger (including the non jump capable Orca).
---
What's that ?
---
If 20% of that 40% of the game actually goes through with their threat and quits, that's less than 10% of the game's population quitting. It's not great but it's a far cry from the doom and gloom that some seem to be presenting about these changes, as if EVE is about to die overnight. EVE can live with a drop like that and the players can adapt.
---
I did mention *cautious* optimism; i'm well aware of CCP's track history and it's not terribly great on long term support. The current "new" system shows promise of a change in that though, and that could definitely be a positive for the game and its players in the long term.
---
That's the difference between "Strategic Cruisers" and "Tactical Destroyers".
---
One gives you a tactical choice in an engagement, the other a strategic one before you undock. It's a different story.
---
Take everything you see in the Eve reddit with lots of salt. This reddit doesn't speak for the whole Eve community by any means. The people who are leaving are by no means veterans, they're just people who got too comfortable with cosy ISK/Industry in nullsec for too long.
---
What, exactly, did CCP take away from you to make titan fights better?
---
&gt; a miner/industrialist who PvP/griefs
---
krab
---
Biggest bs ever.You could sell them so they are not free.Also time is money in Eve so
---
That's nice, because it doesn't for most of us.
---
Half the time a good chunk of the fleet has already been jumped for a few ticks before the open cyno even shows up on my dropdown.
---
Have you read anything about me? I'm far from a krab.
---
Honestly I'm getting really tired of them adding new shit to the game. Power creep, etcetc.
---
Yes, but why would I be pointing People on wormholes?
---
And since chruker is pretty old, if you find a recent type ID and need info on it, use Fuzzworks
---
https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/info/?typeid=30196
---
One thing that I'd really like to see was that the size of corps and alliances got limited by *a lot*. When the biggest groups grow big enough to encompass a significant portion of the player base, it's pointless to attack them. It will always end in a loss, even if you win the war.
---
One thing I'd really like to see was if they would add something you can fight over on even terms. Make a point that you can capture, that has to be defended in 24 or 48 hours by say 5 BC's, and that's all that the attacker can bring as well. Make the game revolve more about skill, instead of just numbers.
---
definitely agree with that, if you don't fuel your structure imo you don't care about it so it should just die outright.
---
those tensions were always there. it¬¥s just that the vast majority of non krabs left the game over the years.
---
In what world are "this might be a neat feature" and "this should absolutely be implemented" the same thing?
---
They could make a difference easily with a small force of supercaps or subcaps flown by experienced pilots. Then ccp added injectors and citadels, turning the tides to n+1 and suddenly their skill didnt matter so much. The clutch of an eviction war was about who could jump more supers to citadel bashes and grind ihub timers, these guys didn't find it enjoyable and slowly died out
---
Tbh I am sick of flying munnins. They arent fun and stupid that is the only subcap meta rn
---
uh what?
---
As evidenced by the 1% retention rate of EVE Online.
---
If you know they just jumped to the other side and then jumped back in, they will have a timer before they can jump back through, called polarization. So you can point them then.
---
Also, after jumping through a wormhole you can land over 10km away from the wh, so you would have to burn back in to jump back. You can catch people so they can't just warp back off, you can alpha ships if you have enough dps.  Or if you bring webs, you can catch bigger ships and burn through shields/armor before they get into jump range.
---
There has always been a very vocal minority on Reddit and the forums who push the ‚ÄúEve is dying‚Äù line. It‚Äôs the worst of ‚Äúboy who cried wolf.‚Äù 
---
As for me, I say ‚Äúenjoy Eve.‚Äù I‚Äôll still be playing it ten years from now unless real life finally makes me quit.
---
I would also add stay away from major null blocs a large number of the people reeing are from those.
---
I find it hilarious that some people are finally listening after years of being told ‚ÄúGo back to WOW, noob!‚Äù
---
&gt; Such a shame that the people who made this game great are abandoning it
---
CCP abandoned us.  They made being a "vet" something anyone could buy whenever they liked.  Fuck them and their stupid game.
---
What happens when you repackage the ship though?
---
It‚Äôs sarcasm my dude
---
How is buying plex pay to win? You can‚Äôt be serious with that statement, unless you‚Äôre new to the game
---
If they adapt then good in them, as long as its player interaction then good on them. Best thing is the fact that blackout hurts afk ratting, intel programs, and botting.
---
CCP been catering to nullsec for years. Updates like 10/10 escalations (this needs to end ASAP), ore spawns/respawns, jump freighters, cynos, rorq, reduction to WH spawns (seems they fixed it recently) reduction to isk made in WH that promoted good fights in NS, along with many many other changes.
---
I can tell you‚Äôre a new player because you dont know this things. Long long time ago plex was cheap 300-350mil for 30days, The rats gave more bounty, pirate BS were extremely rare and cost 1-1.3bil (hull only), marauders were ratting ships (due to how easily they can be jammed and didn‚Äôt have bastion), titans were extremely rare along with moms (supers). Yiu rarely had a carrier drop on you (they could assist fighters to a frig, that frig could solo a small gang due to fighters), you had to move null goods by a freight and gate it.....with a escort fleet...to a trade hub! All that risk yet it was the best time to plat eve. Also when eve hit the highest numbers of players and players online. Then they started catering and catering and catering. Now we are here in the back peddle stage that will hopefully put us back on track in a few years.
---
Ok....so how do you get the abyssal perk??? Someone explain this to me.
---
&gt; Have you read anything about me?
---
lol no?
---
pew pew!
---
First, you have to realize that many of those who left we're bots or afk ratting alts. Statistically, those players and not playing anymore.
---
And secondly, the Eve player base has been far worse before. 
---
I'm seeing a better risk vs reward experience. Now, if that means people still don't want to play, then Eve is just not for them. We're dealing with "chaos" and maybe they're just waiting to see how it all ends. Who knows really... I do know I'm having fun. I'd like to see more chaos personally. 
---
I think all we need is to remove injectors, fix the cynos, and make Eve an always changing environment. Such as, new systems and regions.
---
yawn
---
Some of them might even come straight back after seeing those queue times!
---
Bounty hunting is more of a RP thing. We had a good system all along, just pay someone for your targets corpse.
---
Landing after a wormhole jump is based on ship mass.
---
game has been on constant decline since the powerbloc meta became the dominant playstyle.
---
You fit cargo expanders and cargo rigs on a BO.       
---
Don't know how the marshal cargo big can be but people used redeemers in this way.        
---
Plenty space for moving modules
---
that IS 10%. and 10% is pretty big.
---
Its bigger than that though. CCP painted a target on our backs and have doubled and tripled down on mechanics that in some cases are purely punitive. They went too far in their statements and their bile costing them massive amounts of goodwill. 
---
People simply feel betrayed and twice as much actually. You have to understand that we were basically told to amass massive amounts of assets due to an arms race they started a couple of years ago with the promise that it was going to be put to use. A lot of people burned out due to it but the rest held on waiting for the day that some things change so that we can go full bananas on eachother after investing so much time into building it all up.
---
And now they turned on us. They didnt give us the changes we have been waiting for, in fact the changes they are giving us will only make it worse. And theyre blaming us for all of it. So alot of those that held on during those years just realised they got duped on top of becoming public enemy nr 1.
---
Its sad but it is what it is. No matter what happens I doubt CCP will ever regain the goodwill they threw away during this. Hubris is a bitch.
---
My favorite way of playing was small gang roaming. You can see what the introduction of FAX, citadels, AOE DDs and the capital application buffs did to that.
---
Right now each change on its own brings problems for certain playstyles, but I'm hopeful that once CCP is done with all this chaos bollocks we'll have a new meta that supports lots of different playstyles again, not just one or two like now.
---
That's a good question!
---
The games are fundamentally different but learning the mechanics of eve online 2019 is not hard. Vanilla WoW has/had more of a difficulty curve, imo.
---
Since that would mean you also only know what your leadership tells you to believe. Which makes your comment just a version of your leaderships narrative aka the linemembers in ***other*** alliances only know what their leadership tells them
---
It absolutely can. As has been mentioned before, new people try eve pretty often. The real issue is retention. I co-run an org and were growing almost entirely with new players, and in fact prefer them over older players.
---
Sure give me ur nickname ill contract some mercenaries to give you some good time :D
---
They are rising.
---
We're all leadership in Rote Kapelle though. Ben Booley is just a figurehead.
---
It is very much a game of chicken. I dont even know if their pride will allow them to flinch though. Its become such a big issue that no matter what they do they have already lost a lot. But if they dont swallow their pride, well..
---
Btw we already locust fleet in fountain and period basis
---
This is just one more reason I‚Äôm glad I voted for Olmeca!  A fresh perspective that is well written. For all you nay-sayers complaining that he offers no solutions, where are your reasonable, thoughtful proposals? By helping define what the issues are and how we got here makes searching for solutions a bit easier.
---
You could argue that's due to misplaced assumptions more than anything.
---
Perhaps.
---
That's not a problem for marauders, recons, black ops battleships, HACs, command ships, HICs, T3Cs, T3Ds, AFs, interdictors or any other subcap. So why is it a problem for supers?
---
Who are you to determine who 'deserves' a place in Eve?
---
Why do I like this so much? üòä
---
Ahh I see, yea sure that could work - I was just thinking of a way to get all this cyno conundrum to an end what with indy mounted cynos and such.   
---
I mean I'm pretty sure the intended use wasn't that you self destruct a cyno ship right before it lights up or smth. I get the restrictions for other types of cyno - but since ccp said they're willing to do a special JF cyno anyways, why not give it the options i'm thinking.   
---
It will make JF's harder to catch, will open up all sorts of possibilities to move stuff around etc. It's not like with the current method you could catch them unless they're dead stupid (which might still be possible with this case also)
---
Hahahaha or maybe that's also narrative by your leadership? ;)
---
yes thats it.
---
If you need help in Eve, then send me a private message on Reddit.
---
While I get that ganking ratters is the lowest form of PvP, it's also the first level of the response chain.  Granted, that chain is currently a bit short-circuited by everyone going straight to caps, but that's a balance issue in and of itself.  If you don't want/need to put ratters in space, though, there's no reason to undock anything to deal with gangs in your space.
---
I think this is where we have a disagreement. The thing is, Eve is not like Wow, it's not a themepark MMO, it's a sandbox. You're not playing the game for the quests and grind as you would with World of Warcraft and most other MMOs. Eve relies on player interaction to create the fun and the more you focus on that themepark MMO feel, the less of Eve you get. The sandbox and player interactions is what differentiates Eve from other MMOs. We don't want another Wow, but in space.
---
How long do the different anchorable items last in space before disappearing? I understand that secure containers last 30 days without interaction, is that right? How long do mobile depots stay afloat before disappearing assuming they are not reinforced and then destroyed?
---
Or cost less and have worse stats so they are MORE easily thrown away.
---
i think its just odd, i love playing eve and i love mythic raiding on retail wow. they offer me very different kinds of challenges and very different kinds of experiences and i love them both.
---
Its bigger than that. Like I said, its retention rates going down the drain, its megabattles not happening. Plus at some point we lose critical mass and the cascade starts. And honestly, I think its a lot more than 20% (accounts) thats leaving, atleast from NS, maybe not from the game but. Not saying Eve is gonna die tomorrow but the dying just got a lot faster.
---
Hey I hope so too. We have no issues that cant be fixed is CCP actually starts giving a shit about their product.
---
My favourite past time is spend a couple hours scamming newbies out of their assets. Nothing brings more joy than tears of desperate newbies who lost everything he owned.
---
It is a bit ridiculous, but the point would probably be expensive... though, from the multiple analyses done by the community, these things end up not worth as much as they probably should be. I am guessing this point cost somewhere between 500m and a billion, and is thrown onto an Arazu or Lachesis.
---
Well, at no point did CCP nerf (for example) nano kitey bullshit because it was too dangerous to rorqs and ratting supers.
---
(Actually, they did nerf nano back in like 08 or some shit to end the Vagabond Online meta, but that's neither here nor there).
---
My point is that this change isn't likely to fix small gang roaming.  It might, but I seriously doubt it.  The krabs will either adapt, which they have proven extremely good at doing, or will unsub.
---
So the fact that CCP is incapable of balancing their game through anything other then huge, blanket nerfs to entire playstyles isn't a dark cloud for me, or a ray of sunshine for you, it's a fucking tornado ripping through the trailer park that is EvE online.
---
There are so many ways CCP could have fixed small gang roaming, it's sad that they are trying the easiest way which fucks over the largest number of people.
---
Thats true. It feels like its been boiling for quite some time and it just erupted bringing along more shit than just these changes. I mean non of these changes are actually gamebreaking if they get iterated on so its not a big deal. But given the other issues and CCPs inability to actually fix things in a proper fashion has just made people lose faith in the game and CCP.
---
Idk man. But Ive never really been worried about the games longevity but what Im seeing now does make me wonder.
---
The 1% retention rate I'd imagine is more to do with how painfully boring the game is if you just follow the tutorial and low level missions like you would any other game, plus the fact there's the very long training times for a lot of ships + skills making the game look like a shitty mobile game.
---
Thank the Lord Jesus
---
or nuke supercap bpos entirely and let you buy BPCs from the empire faction LP stores
---
It's shit, has been for many years, CCP knows it, CCP doesn't even try to tweak it in a minor way.
---
Welcome to Eve.
---
the former is the flat black line at the bottom
---
Because one bomber can't solo a super. It's a huge problem
---
I am confused
---
Smartbomb damage: is there any way to increase it?
---
Expecting the answer "no" but maybe I missed something?
---
and increases player retention dramatically ...
---
Mobile depots are also 30 days unless interacted with.
---
Just FYI, if you go out of your way to scam literal new rod (either in rookie zones or targeting new players specifically) it can be a bannable offence.
---
I‚Äôm talking from personal experience when I got a warning for simply posting scams into the npc Corp because it was mostly newbros
---
This is what happens when developers chase new players at the expense of veterans.
---
I never said anything about "deserving". Everyone's entitled to pay a sub or start an Alpha account.
---
But some people just don't belong in EVE. It's just a very simple fact. Another way of stating it is that EVE just isn't the game for everyone.
---
CCP made some changes (such as skill injectors, new safety mechanics) which allowed people who otherwise couldn't hack it to play EVE. There's going to be changes to these artificial means and you can expect to see these softer players leave, or maybe adapt and switch to different playstyles.
---
This game is always 'dying' no one is jumping ship. Everyone says that but they take a break and come back. The player numbers over the years always go down and up with the tide.
---
I really hope you do unsub. It seems the game just makes you unhappy and fills you with the desire to make everyone else's lives miserable with your posting in this subreddit.
---
This kind of empty braggadocio reminds me of when my Dad thought he was better than everyone else because he woke up super early in the morning
---
You won EVE my friend....Wish CCP made better admin tools ingame for corps. Nobody uses roles, the API for corps is very limited, Staff roles are just too simple needs more granular settings, permit profiles, better recruiting tools, better shared resources tools, better followup tools........its such a list that better not start.  All this talk about content and the tools at hand are so limited to help lift the burden of corp management.
---
The best part of this reddit is that everyone knows the exact composition of r/eve members, why certain posts matter and others don't etc etc. 
---
You quite can easily narrow down someone's age or the level of experience they have had in life just by what the leave here.
---
Most exciting
---
And together they form...ohhh that's not what we had in mind.
---
So really just much ado about nothing?
---
In the days where the ev0ke-perma-MWD-Drake spread terror there used to be a guy that always was flying the morale Ferox with ungrouped guns. He soon was one of the top killers of the server ... o7 Dalikah ;-P
---
Yeah that's why the game has been on an ascending curve for the last 6 years.... Oh wait
---
I just hope Alan isnt a moron and uses outliers as the norm.
---
does it though?
---
But it was spamming V every 5 seconds for dscan in the clip. He even stated it‚Äôs a macro.
---
They don't.
---
They enable others to beneficially give CCP money.
---
It's a very different thing.
---
The people plexing in game are less important as if nobody WANT to buy Plex with cash, no money comes in.
---
http://eve.klaki.net/heist/
---
I love how you are stating that if these changes wont work its still the fault of PvEers. Great job dude! There is no way in which any other opinion than your own could be right.
---
They can do both but just dont allow more than one sieged Rorq per lets say 500 kms.
---
There is some new PVE content with Triglavian Invasions, moon mining and not much else.
---
Do consider that having little time to play wouldn't be a problem in other areas. Just as an example, I'm part of a Lowsec pirate corp and we have both industry and PVE focused corps in our alliance, and all of us have a really casual aproach to the game, without any obligations or participations requirements.
---
That being said, if you choose to remain solo, you could also do day trips to WH or Null for exploration, or jump to LS for casual PVP.
---
&gt; Good luck targetting and melting 20 frigates before they ruin 20 bombers.
---
"20 frigates for the price of a single bomber" so 400 frigates :)
---
Stay away from r/Eve. 
---
This game isn‚Äôt perfect, but it has more depth and complexity than any other game which I have played. I‚Äôll still be here in ten years (and I‚Äôll be retired from the military in eight, so I will have more time to play). Hope to see you still here, OP. If you need any tips or tricks, check out Eve University.
---
 + oh effect from rg
---
Take this pic with a grain of salt, its a very niche scenario. 
---
Still probably able to point to 95+ base on the lach or arazu in a more realistic engagement
---
Thats not EVE online, that curve refers to EVE: The second genesis, two entirely incomparable states of the game
---
Short trips into wormholes and do relic sites? 
---
I know, it‚Äôs not exactly high sec but you can fly around all high sec systems and dip into a WH, do relic sites and go back to high sec. 
---
Just an idea what I was doing for quite a while living in high sec.
---
Would you spend more than $130 per year on a stamp collection? Eve is a hobby, not a game.
---
The people that made eve, well Eve are long gone. Now a big idea is a new flavor of skins or stretching the citadel roll out to take 4 years.
---
Well, now we need an extra account to sit in a recon ship if we wanna undock something big? Or that we cant move our big things without that extra account. Or that we need to be paranoid and have an extra account just for scouting. And thats only if the system we are in only has 1 gate, which most dont.
---
People will always become more casual with age, thats nature. More steps for the same rewards means tedium and it means it will go against our wants and needs.
---
I strongly suggest checking out Eve University.
---
I'd rather it be something similar to a Bowhead.  Granted I'm biased and don't mine, but did do the wormhole Nomad thing many years ago.  Maybe have it have the ability to poop ships out.  Cloaky mobile base sounds pretty cool.
---
Maybe there's a better way to do this, but find 'logs and messages' window and find a lonely battleship rat. Sit and tank as much as you can for at least a minute. Copy and paste the logs. Add all the damage numbers together and then divide by sixty. I'm not sure if there are any other things to look out for but it should give you a decent approximation of the amount of DPS rats put out(has worked for me at least).
---
Multiply the DPS number by the number of rats you think you'd be facing in worst-case. And if you want to be really specific, do this a number of times and then find the average.
---
The best highsec content is Incursions, so long as you find a good crew. It‚Äôs good group content. 
---
When I came back from my first deployment, Incursions are what brought me fully back into the game.
---
I think the pretty general consensus, with the exception of people that don't want anything to change in generaln of course, is that both resource depletion (less anoms if you overfarm a system as an example) and resource scarcity (usually pointed as "region exclusive" minerals) are things that would make alliances go to war.
---
This, along with a better sov system and a FW rework are the "big things" that CCP should adress asap in my opinion to inject some really needed life into the game. The blackout, cyno changes and small tweaks to FW plexes are nice, but very far from enough.
---
Or, scrap all cyno changes. Then remove Cyno capability from all capitals. That will bring about the desired effect of limiting hot drop response while still allowing normal logistics.
---
I don't know if *this change* is going to fix roaming by itself, I seriously doubt it too. But this change combined with the local change, combined with an overall rebalance of capitals, combined with changes to citadels, combined with changes to cloaky bomber gangs and who knows what else might just lead to a meta that isn't so awful for everyone. 
---
And I do mean everyone, not just roamers. This never ending arms race to more and more titans that never die has to stop. This endless citadel grinding with 7 day timers has to stop. Teleporting gangs of cloaky bombers that aren't good for anything but a gank. Boson titans sitting on gates, shit 5 years ago you'd get your ass chewed off by a director for putting your titan anywhere near a gate by yourself. It's just absurd, all of it. 
---
None of these changes *by themselves* are going to fix it but I have to hope CCP has some concept for all this together that will lead to a better environment than we have now. It's building a new foundation to balance on going forward.
---
just a question : you obviously didn't go there for a fight and it seem you didn't loot neither. so why?
---
EVE : The Second Genesis Server when?
---
Why nerf ships when you can nerf anom spawn rates? 
---
Could the CSM be part of the problem?
---
Well worded. Maybe too well. An excellent response.
---
Honestly, just start ganking. Learn what a T1 catalyst vs T2 catalyst can blow up in a 0.5 system. Learn what an arty cane can one shot. I'm a big fan of piracy.
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page
---
Lowsec gate camps, high sec moons, trig invasions, high sec mission running... Day trips to WH space for gas huffing. 
---
I'd look at highsec as your base of operations rather than your operational environment.
---
&gt; How is buying plex pay to win?
---
Are you completely stupid?  I've been playing Eve since 2003 you idiot.  Longer than your sorry, extremely wrong, long-winded arse.
---
For the people in it, yes. Its overall consequences on the rest of the game? Probably needs more study to tell.
---
Is a tengu or legion overkill for that content?
---
Then maybe the developers shouldn't make game-play require sitting on your ass doing extremely unengaging things for hours and hours on end.
---
None of this happened. Goonswarm is a krab only alliance. 
---
(A1 tactical loot jettison through)
---
Spod liberation is no joke.
---
PLEX gives money to CCP, always.
---
Making explosions easier isnt the issue, its the lack of counters to it. How about making it easier for NS to actually fight NS instead? How about more explosions that way?
---
What exactly is difficult about Vanilla WoW?
---
U mad?
---
You always needed an extra account to own a cap, now you just need to train in into recon.
---
Oh, there are as many opportunities as in every other space, if not more. Highsec is wonderful.
---
Random list of stuff:
---
PVP:
---
- suicide ganking for fun
---
- suicide ganking for fun but also for profit (e.g., popping 150m cargo t1 industrials with a 25m vexor)
---
- suicide ganking to enforce the Code, or just bump afk miners with an omen navy
---
- wardeccing (either mega alliances or gather intel and target small corps with optional things like ransom)
---
- scan down mission runners, warp to their mission, start looting/salvaging/making them angry in an innocent looking ship (like an incursus), if they shoot you (they can shoot suspect with security green), kill their battleship while orbiting it at 500m where large guns can't track you (a.k.a. mission flipping)
---
- check for corps who recruit and have enabled friendly fire, then awox (a.k.a. safari) (additionally, you might be able to steal, idk, structures)
---
- set up a friendly fire allowing altcorp with highsec mining&amp;mission&amp;everything in the profile, recruit people, then awox (a.k.a. reverse safari)
---
- scamming in local, in contracts, in market, or anywhere
---
PvE:
---
- running missions (check LP values before starting, for example, SoE or Thukker Tribe are nice choices; also, you can specialize into burner missions for example with a few puller alts)
---
- running sansha incursions
---
- triglavian incursions
---
- farming cosmos missions
---
- station trading (Jita is obvious, but there are a bunch of smaller hubs you can try, like Dodixie or Stacmon)
---
- inter-regional trading (ferry cheap faction ammo from Jita to Amarr)
---
- market seeding (seed warp scramblers in Stacmon)
---
- get a low tax poco or shoot one and make your own, and do PI to make p4
---
- industry (Jita is close)
---
- mining (either regular or moons)
---
- doing highsec combat sites (go far from Jita)
---
Dank frags were had. Blackout has been a kind mistress for us.
---
And a trillion isk or so super umbrella. But hey no risk at all.
---
&gt;\&gt;So you've basically used the most extreme module you could find, on the most reasonably accessible ship that gives the largest bonus to that specific function of that specific module AND overheated it in order to make a shitpost about balance.
---
&gt;\&gt;low effort
---
:thonking:
---
Wonderful! Thank you, bookmarking this now.
---
Will do, thank you for the tip!
---
I'll look into this. What makes you such a fan of the piracy side of the game? Haven't looked much into it but seems like an interesting angle to go.
---
MJD to recon, receive killmail :)
---
Can all this stuff be done from a single player without alt accounts?
---
Push into sov? What do you mean? 
---
The complaint is that you need a hard cyno to get your supers on grid in a reliable manner. And you cant force a capital fight, if one side doesnt drop then they dont drop.
---
&gt;krab
---
Idiot
---
Test high command fines people for using eve mail. It's basically isk for memes.
---
But hey, the simple solutions are always the silver bullets for the simple minded. Which kinda says alot about the people that are cheering for the changes.
---
You were just plain exaggerating things. It has nothing to do with how you sub to the game.
---
Nobody wants an eve with a dropping population, but how to avoid that is unclear. Changes you don't like and hillmar armchair developing on a stream made you quit? No problem. Whatever floats your boat. But it's not exactly clear cut that what you want will make eve a better game.
---
I did not argue the retention rate was high, or that it's improved. My argument is that it's unrelated to an "aging player base" and other similar nonsense.
---
I play, because I meet pilots every day in corporation or alliance chat that are good to talk to.
---
Big groups would simply slowly move around and leave "scorched" systems. 
---
So no to depletion of systems, but yes to overall reduction of number of anomalies, moon mats. It shouldn¬¥t be possible to have a single region provide enough "farms" for a big alliance.
---
I endorse this idea to remove the blue loot from wormholes
---
&gt; Could the CSM be part of the problem?
---
No.
---
Lol no, they'll have one person drop corp and then elect him. Problem solved
---
No one wanted to step up to be directors.
---
I don't recommend suicide ganking as a too-new player, especially if you're doing it solo instead of with a group that does this.
---
Security status hits and kill rights are mechanics you don't fully understand as a new player, and they will have a significant impact on your future play whether or not you stick with ganking.
---
A string can be pulled from 2 sides. How about we allow supers to actually fight and get blown up?
---
Actually dead
---
(my opinion) yeah, CSM has been a good chunk of the problem. For years they‚Äôve kept advocating the small changes that have only served to help make their null empires possible and safe, and CCP mistook this for the majority of the players
---
Alienating a huge percentage of your player base is not moving forward.
---
None of these changes feel like moving forward, they feel like trying to roll back the server.
---
Instead of making it hard for Titans to stay subbed, give them what everyone wants. Make them easier to fight.
---
Make it easier to dread bomb that titan on a gate, then make it easier to maintain that pressure on their capitals with your own capitals.
---
Make control over NPC 0.0 worth fighting over with small gangs again.  I don't know what changed, but we used to hang out in NPC space and get great subcap fights daily.  We knew if we tried to go to sov space, there was a good chance we would get blobbed, that's not new.  What is new is the NPC space alternative.
---
You can't roll back power creep power creep without losing a lot of players. If you and CCP think it's worth it, I guess it is what it is.
---
as it was always been
---
KIA
---
If we had dwindling resources all of New Eden would have been strip mined by now and all of the empires would have collapsed.
---
The biggest problem of Eve is that there is too much space and not enough players. The available space to utilize has to scale with player population. 40k goons sit in 1.5 regions of space because they can. Decrease useable nullsec by half and suddenly there is a conflict driver.
---
Fw has small scale engagements which are fun, but set piece battles are rare.
---
Not going to be as exciting as you think going through 100% blue space
---
The industrial cyno isnt bad, its just that its restricted. Just allow all shiptypes to light it but only JFs be able to jump to it (maybe rorqs too). And also give us the option on the first day if we want to exchange our regular cynos to industrial ones and logistics will be untouched.
---
They're kinda inept I think. I mean, can you imagine how much plex some people would shell out for station interior skins/redesigns? They could make money and make some players happy just by letting people buy already-present station interiors as the backdrop in a citadel, but they don't.
---
Just Blops Bridge a blockade runner
---
FB apply damage too easily to subcap (frigs destroyers).
---
Last time i've done them there were 2 public groups that you could get into by queing. They require you to use specific fits so you probably won't be able to use a tengu or a legion. 
---
Here's the list of the fits from Warp To Me public hi-sec incursion group:
---
https://wl.warptome.net/fits/
---
No you didnt. It was preferable but you didnt.
---
Just the vocal part of the community
---
Keep up with the narrative.       
---
Blackout was bad for goons.
---
And ate plain bread for breakfast, took cold showers, and only drank water. So he was a real stoic.
---
Just you guys losing. Nbd.
---
said by someone who has never had to move a freighter 30 jumps through null sec
---
Yes that is what the big groups are pushing as a narrative, it doesn't mean that we cannot evolve.a solution to that.
---
Link resource regeneration to ADM and SOV levels.
---
Once the big groups are done scorching 2 core regions and 2 outer regions (low ADMs, low resources farmed) and once these regions haven't sufficiently regenerated (make it like 6 months to regenerate etc?), then they'll need to go-to war and actually occupy a region to make it worth it.
---
At the same time, increase upkeep costs of Citadels and parking costs for Titans.
---
Too much growth needs to have diminishing returns.
---
If they get to fight each other more frequently, then they will end up consuming more resources to replace and eventually become more expensive as a result.
---
Give us supercap fights CCP.... Subcap fights don't make the news
---
Shocking as it can be - there are some people don't play eve on minimum details, with max zoom out and sound sound off.           
---
Honestly don't know why they are doing it this way.
---
Dang it
---
We need to update that picture with an "Act of God" called CCP. Part of the learning process...
---
Locusts!
---
There's Triglavians who are new type of npc that roam around invading places.
---
FW lowsec still has fights happening, some days can take longer to find a fight though.
---
I don't get why ppl downvote this. It's the truth
---
If sov level fighting were more fun people would find reasons to do it more often. Not saying that more ways of 'encouraging' conflict are bad, but that this needs to be addressed too. 
---
I haven't been involved in nullsec sov for years so I could be talking out of my ass here, but if I were to put myself back in those shoes today I wouldn't want to fight a sov war because:
---
* Timer grinds are an absolute nightmare now, worse than they've ever been. More than one week to kill a 500 mil Raitaru is totally absurd when there can be hundreds of them in one system. Why on earth would I spend my time doing something that feels so useless and unrewarding?
---
* Titans decide all sov battles so why would I ever show up for one without titan supremacy?
---
* Citadels are cheap, asset safety is everywhere, so unless it's an important Keepstar I'd rather just blueball you. I'm not risking trillions of isk in supers over Fortizar #14 of 196 in my space. Have fun.
---
Even if I had reasons to take more space I wouldn't want to. But again, I left null because I was sick of tidi fights, and that was years ago when the meta wasn't nearly as bad. I'd have a hard time taking any Goon seriously who said they had a great time in the deployment to Tribute though. Humiliating NC was probably fun but the day to day "content" looked awful for everyone involved.
---
Fucking Defias Pillagers.
---
Then leave?
---
Leaving also entails not posting on related subforums for games you dont play
---
&gt; How is buying plex pay to win? You can‚Äôt be serious with that statement, unless you‚Äôre new to the game
---
been playing for 15 years. alts, plex, injectors. P2W. each and everyone of them.
---
Because people dont need to inject those... Train an alt to fly a marauder or anything else specifically and you're looking at sub 6 months...
---
Plus once you inject into a super, you can realtime train those anyway...
---
You need to go to a trade hub to buy everything in one place, Jita is the biggest and best and sells absolutely everything you can buy, usually at the lowest price. Other hubs are Amarr, Dodixie, Rens, and Hek. These are typically more expensive than Jita, sometimes by a little, sometimes alot, and might not stock some of the less common items/ships.
---
You can buy ships in a hub, move them to your staging and then take a shuttle back to get another, or setup courier contracts and have someone move your stuff out for you, just be sure to set accurate collateral on courier contracts so your stuff actually gets delivered and not stolen.
---
Shit's fucked, yo.
---
Why are you moving a freighter 30 jumps through nullsec tho
---
TOO SOON!
---
https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility
---
&gt;Big groups would simply slowly move around and leave "scorched" systems. 
---
That would be cool as fuck though.
---
Imagine being ashamed to use your real name and flair.
---
Its a game, people will just form organizations around keeping price and supply in a state that is profitable to the land owners.
---
:)
---
That chart is active characters. Hauling alts, market alts, Jita alts, incursion alts, etc all spend tons of time in hisec and are active enough to count. A lot of the Jita alts will be alphas too. Combine that with the new players who will stick around for a week and then quit, but if CCP's numbers are right there are tons of those coming in each day. I don't know when this chart was made but if it was during the time Pandemic Horde had everyone make an alpha alt and stick it in a Ferox in hisec to defend perimeter, that would also skew the numbers. 
---
So while there are plenty of characters in hisec, that doesn't translate to the game being fine without nullsec players.
---
Not needed and very difficult to do right now, just add more ship classes between BS and supers
---
Must be an nvidia card cuz that planet looks like a tablesaw blade
---
what's the cost of one bomber?
---
how many frigates can you buy and fit for that cost?
---
how many bombers are in a stuka fleet (we'll call this x)? Now multiply that by the amount of frigates you can buy and fit for the cost of one fit bomber(y).
---
If z = x * y, solve for z
---
Surprised that Abyssal running haven't been mentioned. Easy at low tiers, soloable, and done in under 20 minutes. Scales up at your pace.
---
get in line krabskie
---
Who said anything about leaving?
---
Damn sounds like someone's lack of ability to balance a game has really gotten to them. Imagine rage posting on your official acct over a dumb meme
---
You can list popular devices and SOCs. Just like you can say with Apple "5s and above" you can take some samsung or huawei phone as a baseline. 
---
Basically, UE4 devs suck for making it too restrictive (looots of comments here), Google gagles mayo for not even trying to make all the personal data they stole useful for consumers and CCP is.. well, CCP.
---
for a good t2 fit T1 frig like 15 ish mill each so 3 per bomber, even with 60 you will have trouble killing a 20 man stuka fleet
---
Too many people don‚Äôt know the difference between tactical and strategical.
---
I guess if you're "that guy" always mooching a cyno off your alliance mates you didn't but most people aren't that cheap. :p
---
Is it though? Its a cashgrab shadow of its former self and that makes me sad.
---
This. That is all.

thats just not true at all lmao.

There is no practical way to do your first point, you just end up with Goonswarm A, Goonswarm B, etc.  Your second is just describing instanced arena PvP, which is something dozens of games already offer.  That's not Eve's niche.
---
In essence, you're describing World of Tanks' Clan Wars.  I can tell you from experience, the only thing that held back blobbing in that environment was the fact that the skilled players who made up the relevant powers disdained it and would actively band together to prevent it and punish anyone who tried it.  The mechanics had nothing to do with it.

I started playing eve back in 2010 simply because of this graphic.
---
Imagine this...
---
Player counts get lower.
---
Fewer players require less space to krab.
---
Your solution is to make said space even worse, because player numbers are going down, and the best way to get them to log in is to make their home shittier and force people to fight each other - which by and large they don't do because EVE wars fucking suck. 
---
The only people here shilling for CCP to create major conflict between null blocks are people who are either new and have never experienced it outside reading internet blogs, or bittervets who have never lived farther than three jumps from Jita and have never experienced it.
---
Nothing fucking better than logging on on a Saturday, feeling like doing some krabbing, and instead getting hit with 30 stratop max level cta pings because some fucker in a drake needs to get booshed off the ihub and we don't know if someone's going to form or not. Then when we show up it's two floating, anchored blobs trading f1s until the fight doesn't look winnable and someone goes home.
---
Shit's boring yo. All these suggested changes change EVE from being a game to being a job. That's why the player numbers are going down. We're grown up now, we have real jobs.
---
How would region specific minerals make people go to war? Am I supposed to go to war with all the regions to control them? How is that not worse? 
---
And resource depletion would just push people out of 0.0, not around it. If my area is getting depleted, wouldn't you also assume the other areas are getting depleted as well? No one can really explain how people would act in a resource depletion system. Why would any area you would go to war for not already be depleted by the local inabitants?
---

---
Dude is right; exploring the game, the learning experience and personal improvement that pays off and Eve delivers this to those that are attuned to this way of thinking.  They realise it‚Äôs hard and complex, but embrace it.
---
r/eve are the moronic reeeeing vocal minority, and for the most part should be ignored‚Ä¶especially me.
---
Eve is dying post #43058405...... I mean I'm sure ya all will get it right at some point.
---
But it's not instant death for the game as so many seem to imply. It doesn't even state anything long term on its own, either. Eve has survived for many years with smaller numbers.
---
Yeah I don't think this is true at all. Its more everything is locked behind timed gates (skills) and if you don't want to wait you end up spending real money to buy PLEX to buy injectors. EVE is P2W change my mind.
---
CCP has initiated an age of chaos which so far has brought us changes that have resulted in an accelerated downward trend of activity with not much recovery or rebound so far, and they are happy with that. Some will claim it's all bots etc, but it really isn't the case. Activity is really dropping across the board.
---
Is eve dieing? Nah it's just hemorrhaging players.  Currently CCP is smoking some heavy duty shit intended for horses and elephants, so if you come back just be warned that dramatic changes wether good or bad can literally happen at any moment and they could have serious effects on having other people to enjoy the game with. If you like going it alone you'll easily not notice anything.
---
On the other hand, the usual broken things like delve, citadel spam, fozzie sov, all remain completely broken with no fixes coming in the foreseeable future.
---
Enjoy!
---
I tried to login yesterday after a long time, the queue was ..... no words for it. Wait time, well over an hour.
---
Reddit is not an example that reflects the entire player base. People have been abandoning this game since they first started, its nothing new. 
---
I've been playing off and on since 2006, I don't take breaks because of what CCP does or doesn't do. 
---
Lastly, its the August lul, happens every year. Places in the world that are generally abysmal in terms of weather and activities are full of life during July and August. Why stay inside and play in video game when you can go outside and get sun. Especially when you know that within the next 30-60 days the weather is going to turn to crap. 
---
Hope we can pew pew soon!
---
Yeah but like... ever considered that the vast majority of players live in null? I mean, CCP literally gives us a map with a little display that proves it.
---
its going to die, like back in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018
---
I have the same general sentiments. I have been playing for probably just under a year and this is one of the best games I've played in my life (and I've played a lot of them). I'm pretty disappointed I wasn't around for the golden ages of the game. I think this game has the potential for a great future, but it seems that a lot of the veterans that make up the back bone of the player count are jumping ship, and unfortunately, in todays current gaming climate, a niche game like Eve is going to struggle to with new player retention. I hope I'm wrong, and I'm going to be playing for a long time regardless, but it's definitely bittersweet.
---
Abyssal Space is basically what you want. It's quick 20 minute solo dungeon. You either finish it in 20 minutes or you die. You have to be able to fly a cruiser to do them (not T3 cruiser though), but since you can fly a tengu I'm assuming you can fly other cruisers as well.
---
Don't take reddit too much at face value, the quality is similar to the forums in terms of outrage sometimes. Lots of old people returning/new players and playing the game if the post in my corp's forums is any indication.
---
I can tell you are, and I highly doubt you been playing since 03. You‚Äôre question are out there. If you went thru the struggle that beta players went through, you would be a harden player that‚Äôs against all these updates. I have 1.8 trillion isk and by no means does that give me a ‚ÄúI win button‚Äù. Winning comes from having friends, understanding game mechanics, trying things that other players would of never thought of. Having plex or isk without the basic understanding of eve just makes you a loot  penyata. Makes it easy for someone to befriend you and steal your assets. Like what happened to CO2 and many others who were rich and wiped out in a few weeks. 
---
Why do i even have to explain this. Anyone who‚Äôs been playing for 4 years would have this basic understanding. Hell even when one of the in game gambling companies paid 100‚Äôs of trillions in isk to destroy goons didn‚Äôt work. Where power comes from is simple. Just to list a few.
---
Understanding game mechanics 
---
Have a strong following 
---
Close and trusted leaders
---
Checks and balances 
---
Taking care of your own
---
Great SRP, (to encourage the fallen to get back on grid)
---
Strong logistical backing
---
All of this is done in game without the need to sell plex.
---
What plex does for strong and wealthy players is RMTing. Outside of that, isk is nothing more than a in game currency that you can trade for items in game. Which does nothing in the hands of a noob.
---
Another solution that would only further consolidate large alliances. Even if they did fight, one would still win, which would further reduce competition, conflicts, etc.
---
I love the idea that goons will have a reason to roll through all regions until they are depleted while the rest of eve combined doesn't have the power to stand against them. 
---
This is the greatest way forward. For idiots.
---
Looks like it's time for the weekly shitty repost. Thanks OP.
---
Why not? Isn't that literally the reason to have sov space to begin with? This is the problem with the current thinking. People want the big alliances to break up, but are demanding they hold several regions to be able to function. Who else is going to be able to hold and defend several regions but giant blue donuts? This removes the ability for smaller alliances to hold a few constellations and be functional.
---
It sounds cool until you take into account the eye bleeding logistics, pilot and FC burnout and all the other shit it would take to manage this
---
Eve is just not "fun" any more
---
I really wish that the tutorial would focus on finding a corp related to the activities you feel sounds interesting at the end of the tutorial. I must have quit 5 times at least before I got hooked thanks to this dude getting me into a tiny 0.0 corp back in 2007. Screw missions, mining, pvp or wormholes, it's all boring if you have no one to socialize with, at least imo.
---
it's not selfless if you trumpet it at every opportunity as an excuse for your shitty behaviour once you're out. ever thought you might be reflecting poorly on the corps/army by being such an ass in public?
---
you were a fobbit, weren't you
---
If you are referring to the big nul blocs going to real war with each other over resources, it won't happen. Simple way of looking at this logically is they'd farm there home region first, then the neighbouring rent systems or pet systems whatever you wanna call them.
---
After this becomes the real problem for eve. If there home system isn't recovered at this stage. Example here goons isn't going to travel all the way north and fight nc for there resources cause nc will have already depleted there resources and be working on neighbouring regions aswell.
---
What will happen here is a form of crop rotation depending on spawn rate farm this region for week one this for week 2.
---
In worse case scenario the big alliances will do is crush smaller alliances for there space. Prime example here is providence sits at the border of legacy. Should legacy decide they need them moons providence would be gone tomorrow.
---
What your suggesting has merite but needs to be done correct. You need to give the big alliances a real reason to engage an the want to engage each other. Limiting there ability to move with cyno changes isn't helping that at all.
---
Simple solution to this is starring ccp in the face for years already. Probably be shot for saying this. But if you limited alliances to 2000 players and corps to 200 imagine the chaos. An the consuladation efforts it would take to maintain a monster coalition. All the egos over each alliance forcing them to work together and of course corps would be reluctant to have that guy with the 20 mining alts.
---
In reality the curve starts at the origin and 90% of players live down there
---
Not null. Since that's all that is being changed.
---
If you can't jump capitals, its the only way to import stuff from high sec. A jump freighter is a capital, so this proposal would remove the need for the ship call all together.
---
Crop Rotation would make the big blocks reconsider and actually make them work together instead of fighting each other via treaties. All small stuff would be quenched out of null thats the result of your idea. Cyno changes and blackout also are just an aim against nullsec. Maybe just remove nullsec alltogether you think this would improve the quality of life in eve? 
---
I don't think your nerf this nerf that approach is healthy or will work. The only thing that works is rework stuff, invent and invest into eve online and bring out new stuff. FW/Lowsec needs a hard rework, same for PVE, UI, New Player Experience/retention. Sov needs to be redone, blackout gave free intel right the argument against it why dotlan and the ingame map give free intel then? NPC killed jumps taken etc. Fuck this free intel too. Capital Useage and profilation needs a rework too. Also how accessible Space is or is not, wormholes need more love. A lot of suggestions people made the last couple of weeks but only the least effort ones with nerf is what actually will happen. CCP uses the money we pay for sideprojects since forever while only a few people work on eve the greater part of the company works on different topics for years. CCP should have taken the hint before the PA deal and get new devs and put more devs onto eve, rework the spaghetti code etc. But they didn't even when they now put 200 Devs on eve its maybe to late cause it need years before we see the new products they bring.
---
Yes this fucking NEEDS to happen. CCP you need to let the community know you are working on something to do with resources. Huge reworks need to happen.
---
huh, never considered using courier contracts
---
Damn dude, that was seriously a smack across the face with the hand of reality. Harsh as fuck.
---
Thanks actually!
---
the general state of things rn is that there s more space than players to go around. So think of it more like needing more lands to rotate grazing on and less like we re all grazing in out backyard and since we got 200 new people we need vital space.
---
Yeah, people will move stuff around Hisec for like 200k isk per jump, I've no idea why tbh I guess they are just going that way anyway and have some extra space.
---
Don‚Äôt bother
---
He says, being in the biggest f1 group in the game.
---
Go make content for yourself instead of being a leech.
---
Because you could still have a bottom limit of resource scarcity (much lower than the current default) that would still sustain a decent population. The current default is far too high, does not diminish, and sustains far too many people in such small spaces.

FW itself is a little stagnant right now.  The Minmatar/Amarr WZ seems to be the most active, although mostly not associated with militia activity and mainly the pirate groups in the area looking for fights.  Those will escalate into bigger brawls, but you can still find frigate 1v1s in a plex if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for.  Ganking is rife though, so joining a group will help you deal with this and settle in (true for any part of space really).
---
I wouldn't say they would go to war. But they would have to sprea and open them to raiders. And since a handful wouldn't be able to protect so many, the entities would split, which would be a very good thing.
---
And at what point are you fitting a cyno to a jf? He isn't saying make it so caps can't jump to cynos just that they cannot light their own.
---
This. But include high, low, and WH space. Just get rid of half the systems in the game. A+++ do support
---
Hey, your response is a little, um, disconnected. "faster drop", "extremely divisive", "CCP data literally says". Yep is not rocket science but a little more ordinary science and less emotion will help.
---
actually the CSM warned ccp of a lot of changes rorqual citadels etc. CCP made the decision to put them is as they are with their nonsense of adjusting later and CCP needs months/years to adjust cause only 4 dudes work on eve while 50 dudes work on other projects.
---
They should make it so hard to make any isk to the point where breaking even is a great day.
---
That will get people out PvPing in their ships
---
Vanilla wow
---
Difficult
---
Pick one
---
Don't take it too much to heart. You could have read very similar histrionics every time CCP addressed a significant imbalance for the last decade. Google "EVE nano nerf" if you fancy some 2006-era versions.
---
i counter endorse your idea to add rewards everywhere as some sort of blue loot and remove the retarded bounties.
---
I'll wave it, in case it's an easy fix.
---
I do solo runs in wormholes all the time; I run exploration does in a t1 frigate and hunt people in a cloaky t3c solo. I don't have the best kill mails nor the best exploration hauls, but it is easy enough to find stuff to do while being able to easily walk away at almost any time with minimal risk.
---
Trade, alliances, wars when those fall through or someone is greedy, cartels. You know, like the real world is with oil.
---
Goons would just split into 20 2000man alliances... It would still be goonswarm federation, with the Mittani as leader.
---
Nothing will chance
---
r/eve: this chart isn't true anymore 2019 Eve Online is too easy.
---
Also r/eve: CCP WTF BLACKOUT AND CYNO CHANGES ARE MAKING THIS GAME TOO HARD.
---
The alliance/corp limit would really only hurt the people who do the organization and increase their burnout, and you would just see "Goonswarm#1" "Goonswarm#2" on and on, they would just have one of those alliances be the one that holds the sov and fill it with entosis toons and be good to go. It would just make it more of a hassle for people running it, as now they have to check director alts in 8 different alliances for standings changes and so forth, rather then all on one.
---
that s the consequence mate, not the cause of the changes
---
Hold up
---
Sorry. Grrr ccp, you are killing my Corp and the game!
---
# I‚Äôve been thinking of writing something up about this just today. The real problem with resource scarcity is that you can‚Äôt make that argument in space. You can make the argument on Earth, but not in space.
---
Space is where everything is. If you have FTL technology that means you can harness enough energy to get whatever you want, wherever you need to find it. That‚Äôs why the stories of the ‚Äòaliens coming to us for our resources‚Äô never made sense. They have FTL technology, they don‚Äôt need to come to Earth, there is boundless plenty between the stars. The only thing that would make sense is that they wanted us for our iPhones \[whatever\]. But then you wouldn‚Äôt need a war, we‚Äôd be happy to just sell them to the aliens. No histrionics required.
---
So, in EVE we fight over resources, but really there‚Äôs no shortage of them. Fighting about resources should not be the conflict driver because it‚Äôs the wrong thing to fight over.
---
Yes and rhey all werent on that grid :D
---
Yeah I agree, POS sov wasn't exactly fun but a hell of a lot more fun than aegis.  Now I know POS sov had to go away because POSes needed removed but with a few tweaks to citadel mechanics (only on moons, shorter time to destruction for example) a citadel based sov system could work.
---
But that amount is going to have to be more than you would lose in the losses of the conflict, the losses of home... losses AND have to be more than lowsec or highsec gains. So you're going to have to HOPE the people you're attacking haven't already picked their own region dry AND you won't lose isk in the process of making this move. 
---
And quite simply, by the time you're done scrapping your own regions dry, so will everyone else. 
---
All this will do is create an even bigger donut of space and squeeze people out. All this does is create even larger empires.
---
Is there something inaccurate about his post?
---
god bless
---
6 months in and love every change thus far. Especially the cyno changes. Only negative thing I've experienced is a sad realization of how many crybaby players there are without the ability to adapt and overcome. I wouldn't have guessed that prior to playing.
---
 Hell, I'm a new player and the changes haven't driven my away. I think if anything they level the playing field. Win button cynos were horribly unbalanced. I recognized it from the one of my first fights in null when someone dropped carriers on my 4 man cruiser gang. The lack of balance was astounding. Good riddance to that bullshit.
---
Hopefully this is read by CCP to encourage them to stay the course. As a new player im loving it.
---
Honestly if you can't put some time into a Corp I'd just play something else for now, EVE is incredibly dull as a single player game.
---
It just doesn't work that way.
---
[https://www.eveonline.com/article/those-anomaly-changes-in-full](https://www.eveonline.com/article/those-anomaly-changes-in-full)
---
From the above linked dev blog: " 
---
"**Expected consequences**
---
* **Some alliances will immediately start wanting to look for better space**
---
* **In the longer run, there'll be more conflicts going on, with more localized goals**
---
* **Newer alliances will have an easier time getting a foothold in nullsec**
---
* **Coalitions will be marginally less stable**
---
* **Alliances will have to choose more carefully what space they develop, where their staging systems are, and so on (low truesec systems generally tend to be in strategically inconvenient places)**"
---
NONE of that happened, by the way.
---
CCP has tried "conflict drivers" over and over and over again. They created COOPERATION (like, remember OTEC) rather than conflict. You can't drive video game players to conflict, all you can do is provide tools and let them go.
---
EVE online itself is the perfect example. There are few other games that let people just have at each other like EVE does. There are hundreds of reasons to fight. And yet most EVE players don't pvp, most stick to high sec their entire eve lives, and CCP have been trying to 'drive' conflict the entire time.
---
TL;DR The idea of conflict drivers sounds good in your head, but it doesn't work in reality.
---
Sp limited pvp zones? Sure youd get twinks but it might help.
---
An idea I was talking about with corp mates was a seasonal system whereby resource plentifulness and scarcity changes from region to region seasonally. Whether these "seasons" were scheduled and repeating, or random, it could lead to a lot of conflict between entities. Just lowering the resource amount may spread people out, but not necessarily cause motivation for conflict between alliances. A changing, unpredictable resource ecosystem would.
---
Not if CCP stopped being bad and developed situations where blobbing, supers, and citadel chains aren't the answer to all null solutions.
---
Think the old POS drainer anchorable but not awful, resources that don't get depleted entirely then pile up to kingdom come so a huge herd can roam through and strip mine then move on and come back next month but areas with maximum resources present so that it doesn't make sense to roam around as a megablob but to spread out in a way that's sustainable.
---
I agree, all taxation is theft.
---
looks at log-in-stats 2013 .... looks at log-in-stats from 2019 ... stares intensively at you  .....
---
Drastically reducing cyno ranges will allow better occupation of larger areas of space. You want to reach the hinterlands of goonswarm - you need to run the gauntlet of the border regions - you can t just bridge in the middle of it. 
---
that way if you grow too much you cant maintain big enough pickets all over the border and enemies can focus a weakspot and raid your farmlands. It would encourage building constellation sized "forts" that will give mini umbrellas and allow the interior regions to be grazed.
---
Yeah I also thought that until I tried it
---
Eve isn't hard.  it is tedious.  It takes no skill, just shit loads of time.
---
There should be a dude with some injectors tunneling through  the cliff and past bulldozer.
---
I see your point, and I think this is why there needs to be a reimagining and rework of the resource system entirely. There needs to be something (even other than resources perhaps) to be worth going to war for.
---
I have only been playing two months, but I am starting to have bad feelings about Eve.  I almost quit the first time because running easy missions in hisec trying to level up my standings to get to level 4 missions was SO boring.  I decided to go Nullsec to spice things up.  I love my Alliance and it has made the game a lot more fun, but since WoW came back it feels like a ghost town.  I make most my ISK salvaging and ratting is way down.  I hope people come back soon because it is boring without more people.
---
Installed on android 7, so it's probably not the OS version. May have minimum hardware requirements in the manifest. What's your processor?
---
Since WoW classic is back and people go crazy...
---
What could happen if EvE reset back to zero and start all over again as 2003?! ü§î
---
No, I intend to have fun instead
---
The game was actually really fun and creative when it came out, unfortunately it was released in an era of MMO spam and just didn't hold numbers
---
unfortunately not many.  eve reader,  if you buy it...empires of eve podcast.
---
and if someone could find someone willing to turn this into audio form.  this is the biggest lore dump. https://evetravel.wordpress.com/lore-survival-guide/
---
Nobody will go to war so miners have shit to mine.  That‚Äôs like saying if you take away covops cloaking bombers will try and fight more
---
They won‚Äôt.  this won‚Äôt work.
---
but the structure the shit is in has still timers and evictions are not as common as people make them.
---
Oh yeah, loved it.
---
Even aside from a content generating mechanic. It legit just makes sense. I get the whole make it worth it to live in your space and be active there. But why in any sense would strip mining to kingdom come mean better resource availability in any sense? It all should decrease the more you mine and slowly regenerate as it's left alone. Just my two cents..
---
in the end it comes down to what would people fight for? the ability to accomodate more people in their corp? rmt iskies? the ability to grief with impunity? A chance to be remebered? 
---
back when null was empty i get the race was to be able to deploy your own station, make a mark you know. now? what would be the drive to expand? power? idk
---
You just proved /u/BadRandolf 's point
---
who have you been talking to? :))
---
Eh? This should require apm of about 8 covetors iirc? Anyone who mined with 8 covetors knows it's managable.
---
So if there is more space, you would want more players right? How does forcing big blocs to be like locusts stripping all the regions bare get MORE players into the space. I just would not go to war over space that is literally ticking away in value. if I am going to war, I'm taking the space permanently and not like rotate it out. 
---
Instead of arguing to make the space less valuable, argue to make giant coalitions less desirable. Argue to make small alliances living in only a few constellations worth it.
---
This line of thinking removes anything but giant bloc level coalitions from 0.0. Small alliances will never survive this style of play.
---
No its pay to loose, as when people like you would PLEX into a titan a lot of people will have fun with you loosing it stupidly because you have the skill points, but no skill ...
---
a dread fitted is 1,8b chances you get rolled is lower than chances the next bomber fleet find you in nullsec in your carrier for the same isk.
---
Morning!
---
Thanks! Have a nice day.
---
So roughly half the responders took their balls (assuming they have any) and went home, meaning their responses were useless. in a thread asking how badly they fared in krabbing since the blackout. Thanks for venting, though as it's illuminating to hear some of the loudest anti blackout voices basically say they're speaking from a position of no actual blackout experience.
---
The persons reporting continued Krabbing (whether ADM related or for isk) report losing a ship every two hours at worse or none at all. I didn't get as good good feel for numbers but It ran from a reported low of 3:1 to a high of 100% success rate with unreported isk and no losses in many hours.
---
This is hardly scientific but it doesn't seem like it's all that bad in terms of risk to reward.
---
My sentiments line up pretty well with what /u/Sadic_Anark said:
---
&gt;I'd say that's a great and possitive change for the game, even if my lazy afk isk making activity got fucked.
---
I agree. I feel like the lazy ISK making is bad not just for the game but for me. The idea of grinding a lot is actually kinda seductive when it's easy to do. "If I only do this another hour, I'll have my new shiny" is an easy trap to fall into. Making the ISK generating a little bit more difficult has helped in freeing me from that rut.
---
Let's assume that ISK fluctuates too much to calculate the cost from the stated cost in ISK, if we work from the USD figure given:
---
$16,500 in 2005 = ¬£10,000 in 2005
---
¬£10,000 in 2005 = ¬£14,500 in 2018
---
¬£14,500 / ¬£30 \* 1100 = 531,666 PLEX (1100 PLEX \~ ¬£30)
---
531,666 PLEX \* 30m ISK = 15,950,000m ISK
---
So let's round that to **16 trillion ISK**
---
*All figures have been approxiimated (generally down apart from the final figure)*
---
This is the way to get revenge in EVE
---
*PS - Bounty hunting using the ingame mechanics is crap at the moment and Hilmar basically said as much in EVE Fanfest @ Home*
---
I'm gonna step out of character for a bit to address what you're saying, in a more sensible manner than my op if that‚Äôs ok with you.
---
To be honest, imo you‚Äôre taking a very blinkered approach to a diverse game that has many opportunities for players to find something that‚Äôs fun for them to do.
---
Null and WH space still operate in very different ways.  Null still has huge groups of aligned players, intel networks, supercap umbrellas, unsurmountable wealth and resources, integrated IT services, people in actual management roles (lol).  Jump gates, cyno beacons, asset safety.  It‚Äôs all still there.  
---
Local has and cynos will change.  But null blocks have leaned too heavily on both as a means to protect the large areas of space they hold.  Eve was never meant to be a safe place, you should be shitting your pants when you undock and where resources are most profitable that space should be more laden with risk.
---
The dynamic is shifting, ever so slightly.  Embrace it mate, it‚Äôs still an interesting and challenging game in which you can still have a ton of fun.
---
i dont think large groups are flexible enough to move area of operations around. they ll likely organize more loosely. reason given by you yourself 
---
"I just would not go to war over space that is literally ticking away in value. if I am going to war, I'm taking the space permanently and not like rotate it out."
---
No alliance will ‚Äúwant‚Äù to go to war so their people can krab. This isn‚Äôt for alliance income, this isn‚Äôt for territory
---
This is just to make krabbing even more grindy and joblike for the reason of ‚Äúfuck null‚Äù which won‚Äôt end well for anyone
---
O1Y was a great example of what fun can be in this game: two supercapital forces going at each other with no TiDi. It's the bigger blobs that create the TiDi that primarily make nullsec warfare suck.
---
Carebearing isn't supposed to be a guaranteed endeavor - conditions in Eve has led to it being so in various spots.
---
The cost of a game should not be a factor in judging its quality. You could play it for free... If you can only afford 60$/year, that can get you far enough with omega and after that you could plex once in a while. Your argument does not seem to be a valid one.
---
A game will always be as expensive as the market allows it to be, simply because it is how the world works. If they could charge more and they don't, they are incompetents.
---
Lol! So true. Good man.
---
do you trust in ccp not being bad? do you think ccp will start to invest again in eve online largescale wise?
---
i don't think so.
---
&gt; What could happen if EvE reset back to zero and start all over again as 2003?
---
I'd love it if they booted an older build (2008 through 2010) and let it run in parallel for a while. I'd totally roll a new set of characters and begin fresh.
---
There's more than null out there and megabattles don't rely just on numbers or we should have been having weekly/monthly megabattles considering the null bloc sizes. If people used to a safe, high ISK gain null move out and get active elsewhere, that's a net positive; they have to move to less high ISK gain and have to move to places where they can't have perfect intel + an uncounterable force ready to save them if needed.
---
That's kind of the point. Us noobs still can't compete, but we can fail in multiple areas
---
It has zero foresight to consequences so this likely will happen sadly.
---
And the pvpers and high sec warriors will scream and cheer to push it into existence then cry bloody murder when it backfires horribly
---
Like usual
---
Everybody who knows the player exposed knows that he input broadcasts. 
---
I like how all the big block guys suddenly turn up to defend magically synchronous working multiboxes. Even if its proven that they are at least input-broadcasting.
---
FYI: The owner of this 50 Accounts is formerly known as "Silver MinerXX", he lost his 50 Macks already some times before, until he got permabanned by CCP for proven RMT and input-broadcasting. Now he is back, new Accounts and char names, same pattern.
---
Except regions aren't set up that way. Unless you're talking about making alliances/coalitions forced to hold several regions with the front buffers as like a combat zone. Even that is ruined by WHs and NPC space. Even with goons umbrella, hostiles still run all over the space. Alliances not up to that level will simply be unable to function against those that can.
---
Why? For what goal would making krabbing harder and making nullsec a wasteland?
---
What endgoal is there besides ‚Äúhaha fuck null‚Äù?
---
&gt; my Dad thought he was better than everyone else
---
He probably was relative to the people around him.
---
The facts that you made a world out of a mere example, that I never ever said "Crop Rotation" in said example and that you consider the last or coming changes as "against nullsec" have convinced me that you are an idiot and kind of invalidated some good points you made.
---
Just wanted to let you know that, but glad you could vent here.
---
Pirates of the Burning Sea had so much potential as a game, but man it was not executed well.
---
that can work too - just saying that the ability to jump a JF to a covert cyno sounded very appealing and it's a shame it got removed.
---
that is harram
---
Eh. Maybe you're right. I looked at eve offline just now and noticed that the peak population in eve happened before the peak of new account creations. I.e. it was a high percentage of players sticking with the game that carried it to its highest heights.
---
This also was really depressing though since we now have like 3x the new account creation as the first 5 years of eve, plus all the old accounts sitting around, but we're at 1/3 of the max players online.
---
Over an hour is an understatement. 5 hours to get in.
---
we nees more login numbers, didnt you see blackout caused half of nullsec to quit?
---
Most of the people claiming to leave aren't or are people you wouldn't miss anyways. Don't listen to the nay sayers.
---
Didn't we do that with OTEC? None of your answers solve any of this. They're just jabs at how you don't like the current setup. I would also like to point out oil and diamonds in real life are heavily controlled by just a few and have essentially muscled everyone out to the point they have monopolies. That's where the name OTEC came from. 
---
Your solutions only push alliances to be being bigger and less hostile to each other (Kinda like real life eh?)
---
"in their corvettes" ftfy :D
---
 [u/Jintaan](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jintaan/) someone wants to give you ISKies...
---
Imagine have to learn learning skills first, and then biding your time in a frigate and or destroyer, and get good at it until you have your core skills trained to be able to actually use a cruiser or BC.
---
i missclicked on you and my post was for the op not you sorry :)
---
We need more small groups like ours that are actively seeking out and holding on to new players, that's my personal opinion. We're having good success and we're not even in full swing yet. 
---
^^(^^PWS ^^is ^^recruiting ^^‚ù§Ô∏è^^)
---
Actually its not because pay 2 win games do not require any skill in the first place nor did I say I buy PLEX for this reason. I've used injectors maybe 3 or 4 times in the 3 years I have played. Its a marketing gimmick for CCP to get cash. There is no giant learning curve.
---
Yeah, well I shouldn't be punished if I want to take a 2 year vacation and make sure all my mining is protected automatically by ccp.
---
RIP Eve Vegas.
---
I thought you had to keep pressing the weapon to fire like an old arcade game. Did not realize right away that I was turning it off and on repeatedly.
---
At the end of the day you don't need a big, fancy, expensive ship to have fun in the game. there's plenty of things that you can do in just a frigate or rookie ship - I just wish more people would realise that getting the big expensive stuff is supposed to be a long term goal for a good reason (and a lot of the time having something bigger or more expensive doesn't mean it's automatically better).
---
It allows you to learn along the way and gather experience in smaller ships to eventually move up to something bigger should you wish to. In this game, experience, tactics and strategy always trumps what ships you're flying in my opinion. 
---
I actually consider the time gating to be necessary - that way someone who doesn't know what they are doing gets rekt in something they have no experience with/uses improperly, and thus ends up with a negative experience as a result. 
---
Unfortunatley with the passage of time comes a new generation - people who prefer instant gratification and being able to access things immediatley with enough money rather than access things gradually. 
---
CCP is taking full advantage of this ofc, by skill injectors/extractors; who can blame them? they saw an oppurtunity to make money and they took it. They need to stay in business after all, or the game wouldn't exist anymore. 
---
But I can't say that it doesn't make me angry seeing how easy the newer players have it these days. When I was starting it was a daunting mountain to climb too - as it was for all of us. But for me there was no free lunch or easy way out - I had to live with the way it was.
---
But one of the most gratifying things about the game, is finally getting that ship that you've waited so long for, fitting it and taking it out - and also knowing how much you had to do to get there, and learned from those experiences. That's what eve is all about - it's amazing community, not having the biggest or best ship to impress others. I've had far more fun experiencing eve with others than I ever have simply having the biggest, best, or most expensive ship - the friendships, the laughter, that's what games should be about. 
---
Ironically when I started I decided I wanted to fly a carrier; I liked the idea of using drones and repairing people with triage; so drones was one of the first things I trained into. Now that i'm finally able to fly a carrier, I don't actually want it that much anymore. I've had much more fun flying smaller ships than I think I ever would by flying a carrier. 
---
I guess what i'm trying to say is that friendships and experinces are mroe important than wanting to fly one particular ship - but then again, having that ship and flying with friends is a nice bonus. I think maybe newbies these days are far too focused on getting to a certain level than actually experiencing the game.
---
Absolutely agree. I like the idea of restricting Citadels to Planets (except athanors).
---
I remember back under POS sov if you have an 8 moon system you were golden, just fill every moon so the enemy couldnt stage or snipe your sov. Once had to defend an 80 moon system.... it was aids.
---
Eve some guys house 2020, can't wait
---
No harm done, will edit my previous comment.
---
The ends justify the means.
---
don't think you will see this with the changes for cynos again.
---
EVE PLAYER ONE!                 
---
^(the only player left)
---
Personally I just want a fresh server with the old version of EVE as it was back in 2005. Maybe a few minor tweaks that were essential but otherwise untouched. 
---
A FRESH EVE...
---
Got so popular we decided to cancel it.
---
A ton. The explained scenario seems more like he just despises pvp and would rather be a krab instead. He should not be in a nullsec pvp alliance, rather a renter alliance. Said guy also expects every fight to be a capital escalation, which really thank god it isnt.
---
I'm confused. You think that by making resources scare, large alliances will just stop being and everyone will wander nullsec looking for whatever they can gather? Why? How is this better? Why would anyone hold sov then? Why would anyone fight?
---
This Stuka fleet did boosh away from the lance blob... Several times in fact. Thanks for the target practice anyway. Got my first kill mark on my first HAW dread, and an awesome light show! o7
---
Read it again...
---
Brilliant, by telling alliances their people can‚Äôt krab easily they‚Äôll surely go to war to make sure their precious miners and krabs can krab more.
---
Their fcs will love doing scorched earth ops to remove citadels fucking forever rotating around null just to pve.
---
Unless your goal is to just make nullsec unviable, there is NO logical outcome you can hope from this to improve the game
---
Wait CCP is actually planing to do some events in late 2020 ... but with whom ?
---
that sounded like a half-baked idea but not a bad one tbh:  
---
\- set up regions so that kind of space holding is possible (basically move them further apart  
---
\- move npc space away (related to first point)  
---
\- very rare whs in null and mostly medium/frigate size   
---
\- if you want to own a region you better own it entirely and guard the possible bridgeheads (this is already done in a way)   
---
\- have a few chokepoints that need to be held properly at the edge of each region (regional gates or bridge-in points)   
---
Sure evil-doers will find their way in your farmlands but the'd be few and they can't drop caps unless they manage to fuck up one of your bridgeheads and cyno in there and even then, if you manage to get the entrance point secured, they'd be basically trapped in your space with no way of jumping out unless, again, they manage to disable your bridgehead defenses.   
---
Covert gangs will still roam but those are a huge logistical effort and can be countered if you cyno in your home defense picket.
---
How does splitting up make the groups more able to fend off raiders?
---
This system actually has an arguably good suggestion for replacement, that the dev's have just ignored and it as I recall solved most if not all of the issues.
---
I'm probably going to butcher this, but it goes something like this.
---
Player A places a bounty on Player B's head at a Bounty Agent in his nearest station, the player with the bounty placed on him does not know this action has taken place, bounty hunters looking to be a bounty hunter goes to a bounty office, they talk to a bounty agent and request a bounty, the agent then looks for the closest player with a bounty that's in space not in a pod or rookie ship and gives the hunter the system they are in and the name of the player their looking for, this bounty comes with a time limit and the hunter cannot take more than one bounty at a time.
---
The hunter then travels to the system and hunts the player, on killing the player their bounty window updates just like a mission would, and they travel back to the agent to collect their reward which is the full sum of the bounty placed on the player.  
---
The key things here is that A) the bounty selection is random so hard to game, the other key thing is that the person with a bounty on their head does not know which also makes it hard for them to game, they cant ask a friend to claim it because they dont know about it, and the final thing is that with the target selection being random and time limited if the bounty hunter fails to collect the bounty it gets shuffled to a new bounty hunter.
---
"Push into Sov" being attack another claimed system. 
---
Yeah but you cant 'force' a capital fight now either right?
---
(!) lmfao
---
While I agree on the point of the "bot tolerant regions" (we all know them: Deklein/Branch/Tenal/Fade, Omist/Feythabolis, Cache, PeriodBasis) I disagree on the statement that they have adapted. In fact they have not and are all broken atm still, leading to a lot of losses and salt. 
---
I know an alliance whose biggest (new) corp is chinese, that got called anti-chinese racists here on reddit by one of the botting groups XD
---
Will eve vegas go back to it's roots and just become a player meet.  Only more popular than any official CCP things?
---
This is no longer accurate, yes it takes time to actually learn how to fly your ship still, but skill injectors makes eve a lot easier for noobs. Which is good for new subs, and fresh blood, but not so good for when they cannot be trusted as a 2 month old player in a fucking battleship.
---
I like you
---
RIP Evesterdam too?
---
Was with you back n MoA. Good times, take care.
---
Good god, you're an entitled pussy. Why don't you start a company, sell it, and then get nothing from its sale for your 15+ years of effort.
---
Ah, another video of goon citizen #1238289-A ganking ratters with about 150 of his _closest friends_.   Really high end gameplay here.
---
Dont fucking bother, bunch of fucking carebears who want nothing more than to sit and mine all day (called krabbing now)
---
Wars dont happen and when they do they are laughably 1 sided. 
---
Go play a better game.
---
Did you rememebr that old image about the way T1-T2, faction and pirate version was not a linear progression?
---
[HERE](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/eveonline/optimized/3X/0/8/08dd03d086a8f314b47acfce7c97323aa1934c9c_2_690x303.jpg)
---
I don't think the "strategic" decision you think you are taking actually has a context. T3 were meant as flexible generalization hulls ..kind of jack of all trades?....a dynamic on-the-fly changeable mode on the ship fits very well with the philosophy on the image. Fixed submodules not so much.
---
The strategic choice might play a part on the "equipment loadout" you have assigned to your t3 hull...but the idea is t3 was meant as a different kind of technology progression wich was not linear from t1-&gt;t2-&gt;nn 
---
So in overall, i would prefer we have T3 tactical destroyers, and t3 tatical battlecruisers, both with a sort of "dynamic geometry" that changes during combat, giving the elite pilot the options to switch engagement range and capabilities depending on your flying style or combat situation.
---
I would even go as far to say that the "modes" switch providing a sort of "wham combo" of bonuses and maluses. for example say you switch to sniper mode on a t3 amarr hull, giving you better optimal and damage per volley but reducing your RoF, or change to brawler mode and have better tracking and RoF at the expense of increased capacitor cost. Those examples might be my ass talking...but every ship in the game is good at a number of things, while sacrificing on others, i don't see t3 hulls having much of an issue there....so i want them to be adatable hulls that take the gamble on the pilots hands but as a gamble that can lead to kills/losses....should i snipe? should i brawl? should i boost tank? or speed? 
---
Even more insteresting would be to have the fixed weapon slots to be multirole allowing you to fit guns or missiles either way, so each T3 hull is a box of surprises in the hand of each pilot. Today we have way too much specific fits for specific ships, T3 should break that mold.
---
lol why?
---
The chaos will continue until morale improves
---
and yet there are still those who fit webs on orthruses smh
---
Eve classic would be a dream come true.
---
I don't really think they are. At least that is not what I am experiencing. Way more old players came BACK in the last 6 months than left (small sample size, so your mileage may vary). And so far the changes and chaos are great to mix things up.
---
I honestly don't understand all the bitterness.... (played since beta, took a year off eve twice, love it now more than ever)
---
Make eve great again.
---
Overheated in a C5 red giant with maxed out command ship links (with mindlink implant)...
---
The guy is definitely aggressively shitposting and baiting lol
---
Isn't nearly as hard as it used to be is it? In eve it used to be both the learning curve but also the grind. Wow mostly the grind, but was also way harder back then (where the fuck do I need to go to kill these Goblins? just...West?)
---
As a new player, your perspective is drastically different than those of us who have been playing since launch. Note I said ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù, not ‚Äúwrong‚Äù. 
---
There have been many changes to the game over the past decade and change. Some good, some bad. You login and adapt. But after so many years, the adaptation feels very much akin to a job and logging in becomes a chore. When the changes are as drastic as they have been recently, it‚Äôs very easy to look at this as a turning point where the game I want to play and EvE aren‚Äôt necessarily the same thing. EvE devs are free to go the route they wish with their game and I‚Äôm grateful for the time I‚Äôve had in their universe. But I‚Äôm also free to go my own route. 
---
Hopefully you stay with the game and find something similar to what kept us playing for years. It‚Äôd be a shame if it were to disappear completely. o7
---
F for Vegas
---
no
---
aside from being in a red giant wormhole
---
Hype sheet best sheet
---
Ty for the reactions btw
---
Ah, I mis-read it. I thought he wanted to remove jump ability from capitals. I read "cyno" to include the ability to jump.
---
Don't forget that there's plenty of casual content that you can participate in outside of hisec. Lowsec pvp and exploration in both lowsec and nullsec can be picked up for 10 minutes at a time if you so wanted to.   
---
Give it a shot and if you have any questions about how to get set up to take part in that stuff, ask around, or PM me. Plenty of people would be willing to give you some tips!
---
So.. moving from the central-west coast area to... the west coast area. Seems like a big move.
---
Believe me there is, 14 year vet here still learning stuff, and I really did everything except stationary WH-Life.
---
2k alliances WANTED whole regions not to have space to rat they wanted them to have all afk moongoo for themself and only visit them once a month with a jf to pick up the moongoo
---
ive been perma in 00 for the last 10 years and 90% of the time regions were empty except staging hubs and some good quality belt systems to mine ice or bonused ore. be4 anoamlies became a thing there was nothing such like 30 ppl ratting in the same system.
---
Escalation's to supers work not like 1 cyno. 1 light cyno jumps, fax/dread whatever comes in first lights the "hard" cyno then it escalates from there until supers/titans hit the field.
---
With the new cyno changes you don't have a hard cyno cause they don't have any ehp to not been alphaed of the field when the capital (not super/titan escalation) hits the field, and the guys who have cyno ships left and the capital upperhand takes the field. In most cases thats the defender. Who control's the grid first takes the field is the new mechanic. So the attacker is less likely to even try to escalate to capital lvl.
---
i think they d hold sov for as long as it s feasible then pack up and move along. Important being the result that people will no longer be encouraged to polarize in such a way like they do now (as they ll lose the flexibility). Isnt that the overall aim here?
---
The root of the problem is human nature itself. We're naturally risk-averse, and for good reason. You're not going to go buy a car irl and then go drive it into a swamp.
---
I'm on the side of chaos, resource scarcity, reasons to fight. I'm just giving insight as to *why* people want one big, blue, safe donut
---
Your response to this is so naive as well. What you want is literally a cold war buildup where everyone tries to turtle up in order to maximize their amount of rorquals. No side will want to have war in this case either, cause why should they? We will see the occasional cruiser roam around, to your friendly bluetral neighbour with one or two bomber fleets going out every day. Sounds great!
---
Injectors and citadels had plusses and minuses for every type of player.  They also could be explained in a neutral-to-game-style way.  CCP could also demonstrate that there was significant thought and planning behind the changes.
---
These are just a "fuck you" to nullblocs, with little-to-no thought behind them.  Which is why they're excusing the changes as "chaos era" - they don't have a coherent reason so they made up edgy-sounding bullshit.
---
Spreading out space is very bad for logistics. Imagine being a region that's remote and having to do 10-15 jumps to get to high sec.
---
I prefer to think that they are looking into actual solutions to actual problems by adding mechanics that piss some off while making others rejoice. It'd a big game with much history and when something is this size, it takes time to make big changes.
---
I doubt many people (regardless if they are FT crabs, hyper-hunters, or something in between will disagree something needs to happen to get the game on track. WHAT that thing is will cause lots of shitposting from all sides.
---
Of all the things that can destroy the game of EvE, World of Warcraft ain‚Äôt it! Your dudes will be back online in a few months if that‚Äôs the only thing that drew them away.
---
Have to imagine so. I would hate for the players to have to absorb all that administrative gak that goes along with it but there doesnt seem much harm in picking a hotel, arranging a room block, and meeting for a weekend to party as a baseline band-aid.
---
Sandbox ain't meant for PVE. It's meant to PVP loot out of people who PVE
---
Chaos makes the pvper safer though?
---
Because.
---
If your argument is "you're playing the game wrong", then you don't understand the concept of a sandbox.
---
you do understand that you dont have to light cynos right ontop of the enemy fleet, right? You do also understand that you can MULTIPLE force recons, and that they can in fact(gasp) receive fax reps.
---
&gt; it feels like a ghost town
---
Dreddit is recruiting or something.
---
I want to see what happens when TIDI isn't a thing anymore. I would imagine more people are interested in fights when they don't take 6 hours to do what takes 40 minutes.
---
Did CCP have a fucking stroke 2 months ago or some shit? What the actual fuck is going on over there?!
---
It's not a perfect solution, but having the natives be practically untouchable is a non-solution. So the current situation is preferable overall
---
TL;DR: someone lobotomized CCP.
---
~~~ChAoS eRa~~~
---
I don't know what you mean by polarize but I thought the goal was to get more people into 0.0 and fighting? That's my goal at least. Some people just want to see existing null blocks suffer.
---
Who says he is sitting on the wormhole camping. Maybe he is on the wh and they are burning off, or in a gas site. Like there are more intangibles that go into it than your obvious first in line, go to response. Ffs
---
Omfg, one way thinker right here.
---
Krabbing is what is killing the game. People krab and krab and krab, then get bored or never fight. No fun, no play.
---
I didn't say it should be guaranteed endeavor, but it is a required one. As such, null blocs want their required endeavors to be a safe as possible, whereas everyone else wants them to be extremely risky. The conditions in EVE haven't led to it being so safe, rather the effort from the players has.
---
because this is a pvp game, not farmville in space.
---
&gt; To the people who want krabbing to become EVEN MORE tedious and boring for 40m/hour per toon. 
---
There are more ways to make isk than releasing your afk VNI's into an anom for 40m an hour. Hell, i live in a wormhole but dive into null to run your DED's/Unrated combat sites because you guys never do them and are easy to secure, even in blackout (just watch for probes). You have the infrastructure to make this even easier (jump bridges) to cover distance to escalations, but instead, are overly focused on AFK ratting.
---
There was a time before VNI's when people flew pirate battleships to rat, not every ratting ship needs to be a drone ship and you are actually far safer using other methods to rat, but its more intensive. Of course, i'm sure Dave Stark will come in saying "i'll just do other things then that aren't so tedious". Fine, go do them, don't live in null, let other entities move in that want that space, enjoy your highsec incursions. No one is forcing you to rat, there are other options to make isk.
---
It was successful so Hilmar had to fix it.
---
I think a big problem is that all citadels are treated equal. For a 50 man corp living in a few systems in null a Fort is pretty important. For any null bloc 50 Forts are disposable. Coming up with a timer system that works for both groups is tough. Same with asset safety changes.
---
Every constellation in null should have room for 1 capitol citadel that gets special treatment. You choose it when anchoring and you can only replace one by unanchoring the old one first (or blowing it up). Now a 100 man corp living in a constellation in null has one citadel with full asset safety, 2 timers and tethering by default. The rest have no asset safety, 1 timer and tether becomes a service module. Same for giant blocs. One citadel per constellation is a big deal, the rest are basically disposable and are treated as such.
---
An added bonus is it gives groups a reason to expand: controlling more constellations means I can anchor more constellation capitols for myself. Having room for another Sotiyo with full asset safety and 2 timers is a pretty big deal. Same for a staging Keepstar. Meanwhile all the other citadels in the constellation can drop loot when they explode, so that's a pretty good reason for others to attack them.
---
&gt;Your second is just describing instanced arena PvP, which is something dozens of games already offer.  That's not Eve's niche.
---
I don't see why it couldn't be there as an option for those who want it. They removed the alliance tournament because it was too big an investment compared to the views it got, but including some variant of that format inside the actual game would give more exciting, close fights - and that's what I miss the most.
---
I'm down with most of the changes so far. I can't wait to hear the screams when they start nerfing cloaky tactics, though. You just know that's going to make a lot of your guys sad. I can't wait for the return of brawling fleets.
---
Well back then, just like most MMOs, it wasnt solved yet. Even the journey to 60 was relatively long, and without addons you had to pay attention to the quests, dungeons had a bit of a challenge to them instead of "just dont stand in the fire on the floor", raids like MC, Onyxia, and Naxx were a legit challenge (until like all PvE, it became solved and minmaxed). 
---
I love this circlejerk that we have as EVE players that EVE is this incredibly hard, complex game for geniuses only. It's not. It never was. It had more hardcore elements in the form of permaloss, but the underlying mechanics of the game are ultimately not any harder than vanilla WoW.
---
If you're not trying to get bubble fucked until tomorrow's downtime - yes you fucking do.
---
PvPeee is the new Krabbing.  PvP in total safety, bitch about PvE people mining in "Total Safety"  Create Chaos!
---
I suspect the popularity boosted off being CCP supported. At least for non-americans.
---
Plex is 3m not 30m, so it would be 1.6T ISK
---
If you put as much effort in to killing them as they do creating the safety you object to....
---
Well somewhat I agree yes. But I also dont think people should be forced to pay plex as the only way to sustain their playstyle in game, it really just needs to be more in-balance with other playstyles.
---
Isn't that the case now as well?   
---
Anyways I think that could be countered by having fatigue free anisblex things within a region you control (or at least with less penalty) and your "bridgeheads" if you want them, would act as import hubs as well, with JFs doing runs into either NPC NS or LS (that you  hopefully also control a bit) and from there the regular route to hisec.   
---
The map will have to be changed in some ways to accommodate this but yea, I think it would work. I'm thinking it would be like the way you would organize your nation in civilization e.g. - strong frontiers, few hardpoints at strategic locations, inside riddled with easy transport so you can respond to border issues.
---
That's an awful strange way to admit you have no fucking clue what I'm saying.
---
This is...weird. Falcon posted what \*I\* was thinking. Is it opposite day or something?
---
To those of you QQing about his response...do you REALLY think that fitting a module to a ship and giving it links from your alt is some sort of monumental effort?
---
BUT DUDE THAT DESCRIPTION WAS LONG SO THE ACTIVITY ITSELF MUST HAVE BEEN LABORIOUS, TOO.
---
I didn‚Äôt really have issues killing krabs when I hunted, but then again I put a little effort and strategy into it. Disclosure: I mostly just hunt hunters now.
---
There are two potential outcomes, both good for the game. Either the mega coalitions expand into each other and fight, or the mega coalitions start booting alliances because they can't support so many people in their current area, and the booted alliance have to fight.
---
But eve isn't hard it just requires alot of knowledge and researching because the game sucks at telling you stuff. Also an endless amount of waiting to even want to play the game.
---
Can you help me understand why you feel that way?
---
And to be honest? That's preferable. Sure it's nice to dunk krabs, but fighting enemies who fight back is more fun.
---
Why are you thinking the bombers wouldn't just launch 6-7 bombs and wipe your fleet?
---
I suspect you haven't considered how to do the massive titan/super battles that get Eve in the news after the cyno changes.  Because you don't do those.
---
With these cyno changes, there will not be another one.  The ships that can carry a cyno can't live long enough on a grid with a bunch of supers to bring in the opposing fleet.  So those battles are now "first side on grid wins".  That's a big loss for the game.
---
(There's also the loss of players not learning to keep their 4-man cruiser gang moving in hostile space.)
---
Good god, you're just a a fucking moron... that's not how selling a company works, but heeeey, you don't need to know how it works, I'm the moron here...
---
seems you don't know how capital and super capital fights work, where you in one ? did you ever fc one?
---
You will still see capital fights in lowsec maybe and maybe when a big war is about to happen in nullsec between major powers in tidi with multiple force recons but not the ones we have atm.
---
So if they did something to make supers and titans less used/replaceable/whatever what stops carriers and dreads being the next thing?
---
Not saying eve is hard, just saying vanilla wow wasnt. It was tedious but not hard.
---
"last serious war was almost two years ago..." You can't be serious.
---
Ummm, JF just jumps to normal cyno. Like it always has. Capitals wouldn't be able to light a cyno under my proposal.
---
Krabs online doesn't sell subs. See player count since 2016.
---
Yeah! It's exactly like those old, lootbox-infested classics such as Diablo 2.
---
...because getting loot with random properties in-game, with no microtransactions involved, is exactly like loot boxes! Especially when you can trade said loot before identifying it, right?
---
Scratch that; it's MUCH WORSE than lootboxes, because reasons.
---
I think PvP needs to be rewarded. Not just with loot.
---
ah are you trying to say my titan fleet needs to be dropped right ontop of the enemy titan fleet, in order to be effective? Now thats a silly idea. Literally most of the times where you are going to be dropping capitals right ontop of the enemy are times where you usually have own subcaps on field yourself, or straight up dropping enemy capitals with your own. Guess what? Dreads have the shittiest locking time in game, and with nerfed carriers good luck trying to pop the enemy cyno before it either a) drops most of their capital fleet or b) drops fax and reps force recon.
---
Fuck off shithead. The balance in this game blows dicks anyways regardless of this shitpost.
---
Fuck man, honestly can not wait for CCP to go under.
---
Eve some guys house sounds unironically fun.  You just have to find someone willing and able to host a large number of Eve players even after that one time where some goons got wasted on moonshine and puked all over the hosts house.

But it's so much cheaper to rent space in Topeka!

Hopefully this flexibility will allow them to move around each year and reach more players that couldn't travel, however, I do worry about moving it every year causing event fatigue and extra expenses for them to eventually one yet, not do them at all in NA.

I am so very curious ..... lets pretend GOON would disband and TAPI would disband .... what then ?
---
How would the game be better? How would your gameplay be affected by that and your life would be better?
---
Ok.
---
Why does that matter to you?
---
Why would changing that do literally anything for you
---
Why.
---
To the people, and even OP who want r/Eve to be a swamp of their tears and shitposts.
---
To the people who want to discuss everything else but something that others can use or be happy about.
---
To the people who have never in their life posted encouraging stuff.
---
Why? Why do you WANT to keep looking only on dark sides, when there are so many bright ones? Bringing grief and salt here doesn't make our soup any better. Bringing your tears only because you will fill better when your karma goes up a little?
---
 What possible outcome do you want and why? (And explain it, because "grrr cyno changes" "fuck CCP" "eve is doomed" and "unsubbing" are short-sighted and the very consequence of your decadent mood...)
---
Except thats the exact scenario you described. You cry about having to do pvp, whilst not having enough time to do your krabbing. Am I wrong, or are you just afraid of admitting youre actually in the wrong alliance?
---
Probably because a lot of eve players go to Eve Vegas but don't buy the ticket (cause the ticket is fairly worthless except for the nightclub).
---
which he doesnt want :). cause in his oppinion he needs to be able to kill the krabbing super without response. He don't want to build up an own capital/supercapital/titan hunter fleet to drop on that umbrella cause he's as risk averse as the krab he wants for his killboard.
---
WTS: ticket to Last eve Vegas.
---
Being able to move stuff on your own was a mechanic mistake in the first place. Also this can literally can be solved with good account planning. Even when you downtrim this can be solved.
---
People becoming more casual with age is a pretty good myth. People become more invested with their hobbies when they get older - it just might not be EVE. Plenty stay with EVE due to friendships within the corp. I also know quiet a few very old gamers that don't have their kids at home any more and are damn hardcore players. They only don't tend to stay up all night for a random KTA since they are also doing the obvious and go to work the next day.
---
&gt; we won‚Äôt be hosting an official event in Vegas in 2020
---
It says it will be in San Diego in 2020 instead in the release.
---
I love San Diego. But it ain't a real party town like Vegas. I suppose they plan to do it somewhere around hotel circle? Where would you walk from there to party? There is a Benihana and Scottish Rite temple, those could work...
---
I doubt it would take place downtown, the meeting is just too small for it. But if it did, you will be confined to the Gaslamp quarter. Want to walk somewhere else? You'll have to take an Uber, things are too far apart from each other.
---
Pacific Beach maybe?
---
Anyway, if you go, head down to Chula Vista to have tacos at Tacos El Gordo.
---
"The reason I decided to play eve is because it is complex and hard."
---
it isn't.  it is tedious and takes a long amount of time.  But don't confuse that with complexity.  Eve has kept the grind that most MMORGS ditched a long time ago.  If that is your cup of tea, but all means, play Eve.  Just know that there aren't many rewards at the end anymore.  The era of empire building is over.
---
Good god, you're just a a fucking moron... that's not how selling a company works, but heeeey, you don't need to know how it works, because I'm an entitled pussy...

Yeah, so I thought - I'm replying, so I rather have a question than something to add. If I were to say something to everyone, I'd just write a new mail.

In an ideal would goons and Tapi would be in a permanent war over each others territory/resources.

I understand it‚Äôs human nature, and believe it or not i‚Äôm neutral on pvp and pve.  I‚Äôm the type that when everyone else docks up i turn on my gardeners and prepare all i have to fight them if engaged, and if i die fuck it it was fun

That said.  ‚ÄúGrr pve‚Äù has made the ‚Äúsafety‚Äù for hunters become too focused for me to appreciate.  If i want to kill enemy rorqs i do, and i prepare a fleet to do so... same with titans or whatever,.

postioning and timing
---
Reading fail - thanks!
---
Playing for the salt ;)
---
Yesterday a guy from test was crazy in local because i kill his cyno 5 times in a row. This is eve. When i know i made someone mad in front of his computer, I laugh.
---
What's short-sighted in here is you. You're framing everything from the position of someone living in null, grinding anoms to accumulate assets for some unstated purpose, upset about safety and amassing wealth only because of the changes that might affect that.
---
If you want to play SimCity in Eve and just fill your map with buildings and sit back and watch the tax dollars pile up, go for it. But since you're ACTUALLY playing a sandbox MMO, you shouldnt be surprised when not everyone else wants to do the same, when some others have desires contrary to yours, and when the people who designed the game to be a sandbox MMO sometimes won't actively limit those other people from trying to play how they want to.
---
lol what? what are you even talking about
---
i mean like people organizing in disproportionately large groups. I want the null blocks to become smaller and thus more vulnerable. Right now they re anything but.
---
positioning and timing, watch videos of super&amp;titan fights on youtube that will maybe help you understand. you don't warp with capitals into a fight bubbles is one of the reasons, timing and positioning another one.
---
Jim is one of the most toxic individuals to ever play eve and is responsible for more people leaving the game then CCP.
---
If you really want to make EvE dangerous, chaotic, CCPLease consider the following:
---
(1) Remove Standings and the ESI endpoint as well as the overviews ability to sort/show by alliance/corporation
---
(2) Limit Corporations to 500 members.
---
(3) Limit Alliances to 10 members
---
(4) Limit ESI endpoints to Third party end users of the following to **once per 24 hours**:
---
(a) Jumps per hour
---
(b) NPC's killed per hour
---
(c) Pilots in system
---
(d) cynos in system
---
(e) Ships/capsules destroyed per hour
---
Now you will have those whom are in your Corporation (green) Alliance (Blue) and fleet, (Purple), all else neutral, even if one decides X alliance is friendly they still will show as neutral.  Smaller corporation sizes, force players (pvpers) to actually be careful in accepting 50 PI (PVE) alts in what is supposedly a PVP corporation/alliance.  Smaller alliances will allow more conflict due to parity of alliance sizes, max 5000 per.  This eliminates both the BLOB and the blue doughnut.  Large swaths of space become untenable to hold unlike today that is currently held by only a few major alliances/coalitions.
---
Removing the ESI endpoints will force hunters (3eet PVPrs) to actually go out and hunt, boots on the ground to find their prey.
---
The latter is a card game.
---
it would be after the October deal with Pearl Abyss, so there's no point in boosting EvE membership after that point...
---
So how do they communicate? I forgot to join discord, and I don't have a computer with me here, so I had to use the app

---
Lmao imagine still thinking caps need nerfs, especially where the carrier class is next to useless now after all the nerfs you begged for
---
yes watch videos of supercapital fights and please link me ANY where either force dropped right ontop of the enemy fleet, these engagements usually happen at 50-100km range.
---
Okay fair enough. Neither game is hard, they just have tedious gameplay elements.
---
did i ever wrote on top of them? you implied it, positioning = range for your engagement OO
---
oh my fucking god. I'll buy it off you.
---
I ran a wh corp of 30 people. We killed the occasional rorq/super with way less than 100 bombers. However, I forget a 10 mil frigate should be able to hold down and kill a super solo.

&gt;Good god, you're just a a fucking moron... that's not how selling a company works, but heeeey, you don't need to know how it works, I'm the moron here...
---
Holy shit. I was mocking your goddamned view on how he should be ditched without further payment, not saying how it DOES work.
---
I see you got to 48 fake signatures now. Congrats on creating that many accounts. You're certainly a dedicated autist.
---
Then your argument doesnt stand. You state that supercapital engagements will never happen again as the enemy cyno will be alphaed, however you completely forget that these cynos are not right ontop of the enemy fleet.
---
Why do you think they are loudest and don't have reasons?
---
&gt;We‚Äôre also delighted to announce that we‚Äôll have an EVE Invasion World Tour exclusive Permaband performance at EVE Vegas 2019
---
At least we get Permaband
---
yeah but everyone is playing stealth bomber online as a result of these changes
---
I discuss Lore all the time on my stream: https://www.twitch.tv/ashterothi
---
Arataka Research Consortium put out regular updates titled "The Discourse" which is very good: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLK40KD-CfvF-TuHgRhxHDA
---
I wrote a lore primer a while back, and have several resources (some may now be bad links :( ) https://crossingzebras.com/the-eve-lore-primer/
---
The official website for the lore is https://fiction.eveonline.com/
---
EVE Reader Podcast does a great job making audio versions of the Chronicals: http://www.evereader.org/
---
That should get you started :)
---
Lol?
---
wtf are they smoking lmao
---
Killing ISK sinks while simultaneously buffing all ISK faucets to the sky looks like a very intelligent economical thought to me XD .....
---
Also, and you just have to open market for proof, the only item that is traded more on TTT than in Jita (in fact 90% still is in Jita), are PLEX. And this for just 1 simple reason, there is no other: You are not dependant on the Citadel owners will to get your commodities out if shit hits the fan. PLEX can be transferred remotely to the vault. 
---
No high volume trader would risk his f.e. stack of 500 Meta8 Faction-Items by putting it to a structure that other players control. You'd have to be very stupid.
---
If you are only getting 40m per hour on an actively managed toon you sre doing it wrong.
---
And asset depletion actually balances the table more than makes the current king stronger.
---
How do you think a smaller group is ever supposed to catch up to a larger group if the larger group csn gay resources at a rate an order of magnitude higher?
---
I disagree.  Everyone seems to agree that new subs are the best way to keep EVE going, and new subs are neither PVP extremists nor mega krabs.  It's the noobs that need more attention/interest/survivability from CCP, not the nullblocs.  It's the overly-powerful nullblocs that are killing everyone with boredom.
---
PYFA tells me it's fine. Tight (99.21% / 0.60 available) but still good. Maybe your mobile fitting app didn't update to reflect the Damavik powergrid buff a few months ago?
---
A lot of people claim they don't care about killboards, but their actions give lie to that claim. Even if you aren't the type of person who obsesses over scoreboards, a permanent and public record containing the details of every pvp interaction you've ever had isn't really something you can completely ignore. Even if you don't care much about it, it affects how others will see you for the rest of your EVE career (and potentially beyond that).
---
Sorry about my previous reply; I need to remember not to open Reddit before I finish my first cup of coffee.
---
50-200km are in issue in capital engagements since when? you never even where in one i guess :) man really trust the guys who where in those.
---
Because it balances the game overall, making the ecosystem healthier.
---
If someone wants to escalate with a large cap fleet you light more than 1 cyno.... lighting 3 cynos at same time almost guarantees no issues bringing the fleet in. Lighting at 310 off target almost guarantees no issues bringing fleet in. 
---
It only takes 1 tick to hit jump to so I really am having a tough time understanding all this bitching.
---
I'm in California. I don't mind traveling to Vegas. It's not that far. I wish CCP wouldn't move it.
---
You've got a queue to buy the game, a second queue to log in, and a third queue to join your server of choice. Apparently, WoW Classic alone on launch day had more concurrent players than ever in WoW's entire history. I'm not surprised Blizzard was unprepared lol
---
They have yet to give reasons or goals beyond ‚Äúnull is too safe‚Äù .
---
Then answer what making it dangerous will ACCOMPLISH. or what the goal even is beyond bitching to get it easier for you you know?
---
It isn‚Äôt a tall order 
---
Soapbox away!  Teach me! Convert me to your views!
---
if its a sandbox then everyone should stop reeing and adapt
---
dude you keep being my beacon in this game :)
---
I'm also in San Diego. I rather it stay in Vegas.
---
how???? How would it balance the entire game and ecosystem and what benchmark are those buzzwords based on???
---
take a T3D with combat probe and shoot down mtu in HS
---
Because eve is a sandbox MMO, not SimCity. If you want to sit in a corner and try to build as much as you can, go for it. But since it isn't actually SimCity or some single player game, don't be surprised when not everyone else wants to play like you, or when others want to play directly contrary to you.
---
That's what a sandbox game is. People doing what they want within the framework provided, vying with each other to make the mark they want to make (or not). And sometimes ccp remembers this and manages to execute changes that keep things somewhat balanced between the different playstyles.
---
The balance has been off in favor of those who want to create and build and maintain for quite a while now, and ccp may be trying to tip the scales to a more even point.
---
Not by taking away the small groups resources if you wanted my honest answer to that
---
on in individual level? sure, multiple times the effort.
---
not entirely true. before chaos no local i could have went with ratting vni into hostile sov and just ratted. warp out when local gets a +1 and be 100% save. same safety as for the locals. most regions are so empty that you could do this easily if u wanted to.
---
so what made it save were drone mechanics and local. 0 effort from the players.
---
Derelik is a pod land
---
It‚Äôs not about the time .. a regular titan pilot needs multiple months/years to train .. skill injectors just make people skip the training that‚Äôs why we have so many titans , not because the training time is to short , because people can inject a all 5 character within seconds
---
Then what are you even on about? You are literally accepting that I am right at this point.
---
Easily afkable/throwaway ships make losses meaningless. Causes isk inflation and screws up the economy. People have become entitled to their afk money makers and are now raging/crying that isk doesn't just appear in their wallet anymore using nearly risk free by using Intel tools like NEAR2 to ping them to warp out of their site when someone shows up 2j away. It now takes effort and other tactics, which is good for the game and makes botting harder. You can still AFK, but at a loss of isk making, or using larger/slower ships (Domi's)
---
Nothing is worse than roaming space and having every system with 5-20 people in it and no one out in space, or 3 VNI's sitting on tether (or landing on a citadel from warp as you load grid) and then just docking up and not reshipping to fight or do anything.  
---
If your sole purpose in this game is to see who can get the fattest wallet, then go live somewhere else, like highsec, where no one is going to interrupt your krabbing. Otherwise, put on your big boy pants and start defending your space.
---
Are these particular blackout/cyno changes what I personally would of done to improve the game? Probably not, but its a hell of a lot better than sticking with the status quo of nullblocks talking shit from tether and everyone just docking up with nearly perfect intel at the sign of any danger while being swarmed by thousands of AFK bot/rorq farms.
---
Hey Fuzz, question:
---
Will the indy cyno last 10 minutes? Seems impractical as most are done using it the minute. Plus if more time is needed the industrial can hold more fuel to extend having it up. Main concern is nerds killing the cyno ship (which made no matter with rookie ship cynos but even packaged industrials are annoying to carry around).
---
This image was originally about Dwarf Fortress. It isn't really applicable to any other game.
---
Or what's left of it.
---
you will see what i foretold :) now those 3 cynos are squishy as fuck, and die in seconds or get alphaed. The fleet which holds the field has free reign so a counterdrop won't happen.
---
&gt; While this is potentially exploitable 
---
There's the problem with both of our ideas, and basically any other proposed change to EVE. The existence of so many bored players with so much time on their hands virtually guarantees that any potential for exploitation will be realized in short order. 
---
If they could find a way to keep us busy, development would likely become a much easier task.
---
So we will all still go to Vegas while CCP stares at an empty venue.
---
Lots of people like easy games.  WoW, checkers, tic-tac-toe, all very popular.
---
Why nerf shops or anom spawn rates when you can nerf ships AND anom spawn rates?
---
And how will they get alphaed?
---
TIL subcaps aren't used to make ISK.
---
Yours!
---
That's probably it lmao
---
Guard will be there.
---
Adapt or die
---
Have a successful and growing fanfest, replace it with newstart shit split all over the world. Like all FOSS projects that endlessly fork rather than continue on the original, they all will be dead instead of have 1 healthy project.
---
Take my upvote, I don't have anything more to give, but it would be a much better system.  
---
You could even have both progression based on a similar system to the current agent system, the more bounties you do the more "dangerous" the targets and the larger the bounty range you can set to look for.   
---
The system should probably offer you a couple of targets and should also let you exclude corps (your own is auto-excluded) and alliances (your own is again auto-excluded) and set filter for maybe ship type, or at least give you some intel on their current ship?  
---
I can however see RMT exploits in the system...
---
RMT'er sets bounty on a player that you know is in a particular place and will be in space at an arranged time in an out of the way place close(st) to a Bounty Office. Get "Bounty Hunter" to request bounty job as quickly as possible and boom you could transfer billions of ISK in one fell swoop in a "legitimate" manner.
---
Your definition of PvP is basically "PvP is well and good as long as it's my version of PvP."
---
That's not compatible with eve being a sandbox MMO.
---
Nobody is claiming nanogangs should be killing titans left and right or that small corps from nov null should be able to take sov from goons or anything like that. Blackout and cyno changes are just evening the scales a bit from how far they tilted in favor of the "I'll get a lot of friends and big ships and be safe in my pocket and amass enough stuff to be unassailable unless someone else does exactly what I did but longer and harder" groups.
---
Even I as a lurker know that the Palatine Keepstar was introduced only to troll the community. Kudos to CCP. It keeps coming up.
---
Apart from the ISK value of the materials required ranging in the hundreds of trillions, probably quadrillions when sucking the markets dry for months, there's another statistic I seem to remember:
---
Percentage of ore required to ore mined in game, ever. It was ridiculous like 1/2, 1/3, 2/1 whatever. I may be inaccurate but you get the point.
---
But I'm certain that at this moment some ppl are actively working towards that goal. Not top priority but I guess there's stockpiling. Rorqual fleets harvesting insane amounts of ore etc. 
---
500 industry alts seem insane? To me it seems doable.
---
If Eve survives long enough there will be a Palatine. 
---
My guesstimate is 2 years.
---
Damn you seem bitter ... I nearly feel for you ...
---
Forward operation base in system?
---
BuT mUh ChAoS!1
---
The first part is an untested hypothesis. I don't agree or disagree. I'll see how it plays out before shreiking. 
---
The second is false. I'm talking bait ships going into new player org home space that is known to have zero capital response capability with the intent to create an unwinnable fights. Again, more assumptions.
---
Been at capacity every year since CCP took over... and you could buy the nightclub ticket separately.
---
Blops, marauders (gank risk), Hics, cs, t3c's t3d's Af's etc arent used to make isk
---
... Change my mind
---
Not really true though. i.e. the Defias Pillagers I mentioned above. You really had to know how to use the geometry of the villages as well as stuns and slows to kill those guys without dying. Same went for the Murlocs.
---
Some areas (especially Sunken Temple) required good 3D orientation skills to get around them.
---
And you had to really know how to use every tool your party had to beat the pre-nerf top level dungeons (Scholomance, LBRS etc) without wiping endlessly.
---
They just have to say there is free reddit karma, at least you will show up.
---
\+1 for high sec pvp, easily the most fun ive had in this game
---
First off: isk sinks and faucets. That one was easy.
---
Second: having more incentive to engage in gameplay that is compelling. Conflict generation is good.
---
That's not my argument, learn to read.
---
in terms of rmt I think it would be fairly obv for ccp to trak like if suddenly some guy puts a bounty on some rando for no reason and the bounty is 10billion isk or even a billion ?, like ccp will have metrics for what the average is, so when a value sticks out they could easily just track that and see
---
When the devs rope off one part of the sandbox, reeing is a reasonable response.
---
(If the cyno changes go live, there will not be another large cap battle in Eve)
---
Resource limits disproportionately effect large guys resources.
---
So I don't know why you think this affects small guys more.
---
Congrats on thinking  that I signed that thing more than once, I was mocking you how you were a complete moron... and it looks like I hit the nail on the head...
---
Yeah why would I use any of them to make isk when a super does it better and safer?
---
&gt;The problem is supers are too good and as a result everyone wants (needs) to have them.
---
Hmm...
---
Do you really think that i care about reddit karma?
---
As long as crabs can crab they don't want to go to war. It's sad but true.
---
Yes this is the perfect solution to the problem. There is numerous ways this could be done. Sub caps need to be made effective in conflicts. Rather than limit the abilities of big ships. Increase the ability of smaller ships. Create new one's. 
---
Like t2 marauder designed for fighting dreads and carriers but hopeless at hitting small ships. Make a battle cruiser that can eat fighter drones with anti drones missles or rounds.
---
Make bombers only able to launch torps and create a battle cruiser bomber give it a tank 2 weapon points and bomb launchers.
---
Make a defence battle ship capable of deploying sentry towers or gun batterys for shooting down drones and incoming bombs and missles.
---
In short there no end to what ships and roles ccp can make if the wanted.
---
I have a feeling you are doing "me" and "them" thingy to yourself: who are magical "they"? Is it a particular person? Do "they" really have a common view on what's happening? Just stop thinking there are some "they" who are yelling loud exact same things and thats why they are heard. 
---
When you are talking in a manner of accomplishments: I believe these changes will accomplish hypothesis verification or not verification that is formulated smth like "Chaning X will increase DAU and retention by Y" (these are game metrics for number of users and their coming-back-to-the-game rate). And... That's it, just testing, if it's working out -- excellent, if not -- try other stuff, maybe something else will work. And this is game designer's job. We have some changes = they are working. Changes can be bad for you, but others may like it, and vice versa, some of them may be even bad for everyone, but you don't fucking hit people or projects with a brick for mistakes.
---
Why is this BR tool so bad at estimating value? The associated zkillmails are significantly lower in value than the amount listed in the tool.
---
eveuniversity is great, also you can use search on youtube for different stuff. when you find hisec to boring check lowsec/nullsec corps. For Nullsec in Recommend Karmafleet(Imperium), Brave Newbies (Legacy), Dreddit (Legacy) or Pandemic Horde(Pandafam).
---
sadly i don't know about lowsec maybe snuff? rote kapelle if they still exist?
---
For faction war stuff ushra kahn and other's maybe?
---
I don't think so, at least as of yesterday there wasn't. Checking now.
---
It already changed from what it was to what is has been the last few years.
---
These changes are only working to return it closer to what it originally was.
---
You've got the burden of proof wrong.
---
Diamond rats? Lol how do you have an orca but not know about FOBs
---
Literally.
---
‚ô¶ type rats have been in the game for years now.
---
I played for about a decade amassed 500 billion and then stopped. Sitting on a hotdrop for a few hours while I fall asleep isn't my idea of fun. Gate camping while watching a movie, isn't either. It's a game where you have to have 2-3 accounts let alone characters and a lot of spare time. I had some good times for sure, but overall the player drama is too exhausting.
---
Just make a set of fucking screenshots and uninstall the game, you can open up that folder of yours and jack off to those pics you made completely free of charge!
---
Amen.
---
yea lets give rorqs an easy cyno so they can serve as initial logi right?
---
&gt; Fuck off shithead
---
AHAHAHAHA &lt;3
---
Yeah, that makes perfect sense. I still think the tactical ships that shift modes are a good idea, though.
---
I enjoyed the Machariel, T3C, Ferox meta. Machs were super versatile but still had fun counters and reasons to use T3Cs or Feroxes.
---
why not just blow it up if its low fuel
---
You must live under a rock
---
&gt;The first part is an untested hypothesis. 
---
No, the first part is basic math.
---
A 400kEHP subcap doesn't last long when holding still on a grid with supers.  We know what happens to ships that don't last long on a grid with supers, because we have to use interceptors to position the cyno (massive cap fleets bubble themselves due to how the game breaks down with that many on grid).  We know we will get 1-5 caps through per inty cyno (did I mention the game breaks down?  Lots of stuff becomes unreliable.  Like populating the "jump to" menu quickly.)
---
That works right now because those caps that do get through can light a cyno that gets everyone else through.  It doesn't work when those 1-5 caps can't light a cyno.  And that's not dealing with the inability to position your cyno anymore (remember the fleets bubbling themselves?)
---
&gt;The second is false. I'm talking bait ships going into new player org home space that is known to have zero capital response capability
---
Then why are you whining about cynos and carriers?  If they have "zero capital response capability", there aren't carriers to drop on you.
---
Again, cynoing in caps requires your fleet to stay on one grid for a while.  If you're a small gang under a hostile umbrella, don't stay in one place very long.  We see the wrecks left behind by the people who learned this (and proper target selection).  We get to wreck the people who stay in one place for a long time and then come to r/Eve talking about how elite they are with their bait ships, but the damn cynos and carriers!!
---
if that part of the sandbox ropes off all other parts of it it needs some roping off
---
Because no one ever does - New Eden is littered with literally thousands of these derelict structures, no one ever wastes the ammo to blow them up.  They just sit, and sit, and sit, clogging up the overview.
---
They're not abandoning it. 
---
It's just that such a massive sandbox thing has never been attempted before. The Sandbox is not only the game itself but the whole community. The player to player interaction is only one part. The community to ccp interaction is another layer. And there's more and more layers. This has never been done before and CCP are just way over their heads in the water.
---
Welp. I'd like to place an order of one whoosh.
---
Alternatively they could be removed easier if they changed the stupid timers on them. Even just remove timers on  low power ones.
---
It really is a bad thought out mechanic. A timer shouldn't be more than 24 hours max and only 1 timer.
---
its a kind mistress to all pvp oriented players, loving it so far not sure if its good or bad for the long haul but guess we will see. and on all the comments about you being a goon, well in a 30000 account organisation you are bound to get mixed feelings on this change.
---
The actual contract itself was for 1 billion. the $16k figure is the estimated value of everything taken which includes the 1 bill contract plus other goods stolen totaling 30 bill.
---
So the contract would be equivalent to about 50 bill today (using your numbers).
---
STOP PLAYING THE SANDBOX WRONG!!!!1!!!1!!
---
They didn't want everyone focused on one point so now you have to do smallgang stuff all over the world. It's just an out growth of Entosis sov.
---
&gt; seem to understand or actually be playing "EVE Online"
---
That's "You're playing the game wrong".  Especially when you follow it up with your description of the "right" way to play.
---
keep in mind that out of 100 people who say "well CCP that was the last straw, I'm quitting!" maybe only 1-2 actually do end up quitting. Most people just are frustrated and want their complaints taken seriously so they make the only threat they think will work.
---
I agreed with all of this until the last paragraph. Limiting Corp/alliance population won‚Äôt help anybody; you see it all the time in ‚Äúbase builder‚Äù mobile games like Game of War and War Planet Online (you know the type, spend $100 for premium currency and resources that will last you a couple days)
---
Those types of games often have player faction/guild limitations that cap at around 100-150 people. Well the same thing that happened in EVE happened in those games too, people wanted to be under the protective umbrella of larger groups so they formed large alliances of factions/guilds that all agreed to work together. So you‚Äôd have dozens of groups of people but often the major movers and shakers of a world/server would only be three or four major factions.
---
Trust me, I‚Äôd love to see null become divided up into more, smaller factions, but it won‚Äôt happen, not anymore. Nothing short of a complete collapse of Goonswarm, TEST, and/or Panfam would cause a shakeup like that. And something that huge would more than likely cause massive economic upheaval.
---
Change is what EVE needs, not collapse.
---
As someone who spent most of my time in eve on and off since 2006 in null blocs... I am okay with this.
---
Literally unplayable^(TM)
---
No they wouldn't. IF (that is a big if because the majority go to waste) they managed to run low on anoms and moons then groups like goons would mobilize and run their well guarded locust fleets in a rotation in YOUR space. You can't stop them. All you can do is watch like a cuck. Sounds like fun and engaging game play.
---
What is this?
---
When did they get added? Stopped playing in 2011, then a little bit in 2015 and 2017 but don't recall ever seeing any patch notes about them and definitely did not see them in-game during those times and since being back a few months now.
---
Can do incursions. Fairly drop in/drop out. It's group content, but its not like a corp.
---
Found the madboy
---
Yes you are ofc correct. I wasn't refuting that, I was posting in support of stainguy's assertation that the problem is its easy to inject a super.
---
Ofc everyone wants one, because they are just so good...
---
CCP has tried this before after the anoms came out i wouldn't hold out on ccp having any good idea or doing it right.
---
so who according you controlls the sandbox, players or devs?
---
Thanks! That's what I get for watching embedded.
---
Yes and a lot of players, myself and Elowenn included, are protesting CCP by not buying an event or party ticket. It doesn't help that they changed the venue. I probably would have at least got the party ticket if they kept it at Drai's.
---
It never did.
---
The people who were actually "elite" left plenty of kills behind.  The people who want to be elite but aren't got killed and came whining to r/Eve about umbrellas.....ignoring all the dead ships on zKill under those umbrellas.
---
But we've nerfed everyone else in favor of those not-quite-elite, so you all can get your risk-free ganks now.
---
Thank you for all the blingy MoA killmails.

hmm i guess you‚Äôre right nobody shoots structures and they just live ‚Äúforever‚Äù
---
ccp needs to delete structures cause the players are too lazy to do anything except bitch and moan. 
---
yep
---
Jenkins he's a returning player come on
---
Yes on reflection it seems as though I DID prove his original point. I wasn't posting as a counter to his post though
---
By the dreads, obviously! They just point their guns at *target must be within 158km* er, i mean, the Carriers! They'll send their fighters out and *45 seconds of flight later* YEAH 1-shotted him! wait why are there so many enemies
---
Why does WoW have grinding? Why does ANY mmo require you to wait before unlocking things?
---
I would love to be able to fly a titan right off the bat, but that‚Äôs bad for the game‚Äôs health.
---
Having to wait to unlock something teaches you to appreciate in more and value it more. 
---
If you train your skills right you‚Äôre never waiting lmfao. Train some salvaging and fleet tackle skills as a noob and you‚Äôll always be busy doing something in PvE or PvP. 
---
The reason for a wait on things is so you can learn about the game in the mean while.
---
WTF
---
Because that's always been what set EVE apart from everything else on the market. If you want a theme park MMO there are *plenty* to choose from who do that type of content better than EVE ever could. Warframe or Elite Dangerous or WoW classic for example.
---
What nothing else on the market does is dangerous, PVP focused, life is hard but that makes victory all the sweeter gameplay. Stuff means more here because it takes more to earn it and keep it. That's been the spirit of the game for most of its 16 year history.
---
because you hate fun?
---
The loot (databases in particular) is tripled in frigate sites because it takes 3 filaments to enter them. So no, you're not doing anything wrong, you're just using less filaments and getting less loot as a result. Solo t1 frigate sites are about the same reliable isk/hr as t3 cruiser sites, but the t3 has some nicer stuff on the loot table.
---
No the "i try to learn the game" and the "join horde/test/whatever" curve.
---
Yep, just confirmed FOB is in system.
---
Control is not the same as ideals.  Theoretically, the devs should allow as many playstyles as possible.
---
In practice, they're gonna cut some off.  And the people getting those cut off have every right to complain that their game just got eliminated.
---
After all, people still complain about the bans handed out for the "Bonus Room".  No more large cap battles is a little bit bigger of a nerf.
---
Maybe we just need to ask Imperium, PandaFam, Legacy and Winterco to just disband all their associated alliances, voluntarily downsize and remove the blue status and start shooting each other again.  Spock Logic:  "It is logical.  The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.  Or the one."
---
More like a "fuck you" to afk ratters in nullblocs.
---
If you actually do something other than pinch pennies, it's great.
---
the best organized groups in the game tend to be the bigger ones no matter your view on groups like goons you can't say there aren't organized
---
Syntax error: missing parenthesis
---
Well, I've been flying my new Triglavian World Ark for over a month; nice ship, but other players keep wanting to attack me.
---
Quite the contrary! I am less familiar with the goings on in w-space, though, I'll give you that
---
What are some examples of the nicer stuff? Just BPC? I couldn't find a good list of what potential loot there was.
---
ccp should ban ppl on eve for bad ideas on reddit
---
Technically they could be as long as he got the burst first. :)
---
2 myrms and a noctis
---
Ok, explain how to pull off the ULAX battle after the cyno changes.
---
Key features: TEST could cyno in their super fleet after PanFam's supers were on-grid.  TEST could position their fleets where they needed to to limit PanFam DDs.  Those features are gone post-cyno change.
---
HS got FOB and associated rats in late 2017.
---
Instanced PVP is one of the worst ideas in eve because not only does it split up players and prevent interactions that are emergent in nature, but also because a super tiny portion of eve even does it. Spending more time to develop another area of space that will be used by a very low percentage of the game populace is not a good use of dev time. In reality your perception of having to burn 20 jumps to get content is because of where you decided to stage not because one MUST travel to get fights. Is there even a good reason for it to exist other than so people can be lazy and never roam for a fight?
---
That's what I said. Though joining one of the big alliances and taking an active role in organizing stuff is probably the biggest learning curve there is because it's 95% social skills and that shit is way harder than video games.
---
&gt;But big super fights aren't happening regardless.
---
2 is still bigger than 0 so yes they do happen.
---
&gt;The biggest fights in eve history pretty much all involved supers dropping at the same time. Not a significant offensive escalation.
---
No, they didn't. Even in those 'Oh, shit' moments there is usually an escalation that preceded it.
---
Plus you are only looking at supers, this will also kill most regular cap battles which happen way more often.
---
&gt;But this is the only way Eve can be sustained in a post-injector era.
---
Are you saying they are seriously discussing this? OMFG that would be awesome!
---
https://br.evetools.org/related/31002226/201908252300
---
now do that in hsec
---
Seriously. I didn't go to Eve Vegas in the past because I live on the east coast. So now they move it further west?
---
I was talking about my own opinion. Didn't say anything about anyone discussing anything.
---
Fair enough. I guess the point you were getting at is that being too good used to be balanced somewhat by the time it took to train into them, but thanks to injectors that's not the world we live in anymore. 
---
There's no way CCP is removing that cash cow so the only way forward is to ax the special treatment that supers have received with regards to balance. It's also the only way to deal with existing proliferation.
---
Tell me more about what you've done since blackout happened to keep your Corp interested in the game
---
high sec war decs are pretty profitable. you get a corp and flip structures. buy it from the deffenders for cheap and resell at profit. easy. money.
---
That's not a half bad idea. The whole reason the system was gamed was because the player knew they had a bounty and could then kill themselves with an alt to collect it. Not notifying the player the bounty was placed on them, having to retrieve the bounty from an agent, and making the bounty offered random would certainly make it harder to game. 
---
Few things I would add
---
* Only the player that had the bounty could engage the target. Seems like that was insinuated but never actually stated. 
---
* You wouldn't get the name of the player right away, just have tracking agents that would give target locations and once you were in system with them it would indicate who it was. This would hinder players trying to cycle bounties to find themselves.
---
Other than that, not a bad suggestion
---
This applies to AT pretty well too.
---
Imagine how awesome it would be if this station were not just a static model, but a "real" space station with an inside where you can walk around and for example look out of the window at incoming ships. WIS + a decent PC FPS game could have expanded the universe so much.
---
That is untrue. It had double its peak viewership, but nowhere near the level you're saying
---
Outside the box thinking, and memes. These are real things. At least I don't beg for sponsors like some people.
---
Flair checks out
---
It's almost like nullsec should be dangerous
---
Rotating is a bad model.  Growing back slowly to a high level just means the advantage goes to big blocs that can organize migration.
---
A better model would be a slow trickle instead of the big faucet we have now.  Respawning anoms means there are colossal asteroid fields that you can deplete and then they respawn again.  A better model would be asteroid fields that once depleted take time to respawn.  Maybe at downtime?  You limit not how not how fast something an regen but how much can be farmed.  Faster regen to a lower limit of resource means people don't benefit from moving on, but they can't have too many sitting in one place.
---
That's a totally separate topic...
---
who gives a shit about krab kills? what is it with this new HuNteR bOOgeYmaN narrative as a way to victimize yourselves?
---
in the end it¬¥s a simple concept: nullblocs promote passive playstyles that are based on min/maxed personal effort vs rewards.   A sandbox filled with passive, dependent players that are unable to take initiative on a personal level is a dead and stagnant sandbox.
---
Procurers are scary, especially if there's an Athanor on grid too.
---
In EVE? Dude, it's one of the few finite resources IRL.
---
You mean the condition that's existed in the game since its inception? Including when the game averaged 10-15k more players at any given moment than it does today? 
---
Having local didn't guarantee your safety, it guaranteed you had the ability to escape without counter-play. The safety we're talking about is the safety guaranteed by your standing fleet - the people who *guarantee* that you no longer *need* to escape. 
---
Running away because someone jumps into the system isn't safety, in fact, it's the very opposite. Though it is *safe* to do so, it's the *risk* personified through a color next to someone's name in a little box.
---
True safety is not needing to run away.
---
And yet, your comment still applies well to both. Instanced PvP is shit and fairly antithetical to Eve
---
Not whining. Its the exact opposite in fact. I couldn't be happier. How could you take what I said as whining???
---
I meant they're aware that a capital response isn't happening and using cyno bait ships to pad zkill. It's using a lopsided mechanic as a win button. Now at least there's a "check" in that there's risk involved in deciding to escalate.   
---
The rest I guess we'll see what happens. CCP can add variables to the equation you nor anyone else can anticipate. As for right now I could not be more pleased with the direction things are heading in.
---
Why is resource limitation model always crop rotation?   A better model would be making it a steady trickle (regen every day?) but up to a much lower max available.
---
No it's not.
---
You can't play a game wrong when you're not even playing it, you mong.
---
Abyss is solo or 3 man frig
---
Invasion is group, but I run public fleets most weekdays.
---
Simpler, more elegant solution: Delete JFs. They were made for a time when you had to import from Hi to survive in null and CCP wanted to push more people to null and now that is no longer the case, they are no longer needed.
---
Ah, okay thanks. Wasn't playing during that time.
---
You are talking about 2 different things. The issue we were discussing here was capital escalation in large fights. In that case there is no need to 'slowly form'.
---
&gt;There are valid concerns about the cyno changes, but not being able to have a 50k ehp/s tank cyno (or one on your ratting carrier) is not one of them lmao.
---
Ok, what in your opinion are issues? Genuinely curious
---
Yeah, it's almost like I fucking said that. 
---
" Then when we show up, it's two floating, anchored blobs of munnins trading f1s until the fight doesn't look winnable and someone goes home. All while every cap pilot and his 30 Fax alts are sitting on the undock waiting for an escalation that never comes because cap warfare also fucking sucks. "
---
I literally said you already have subcaps on the field. What the fuck are blobs of munnins?
---
It‚Äôs funny though. There are more players in queue to ONE server then there are playing EVE.
---
Quit being a lazy putz.  Invest 30 minutes 2x and slap a structure on your killboard.  If your a cheap Putz, use Lasers and or Drones.  It really is that simple if the structure offends you.  If need be, use a bigger hammer, and create content for someone wanting to step on your dick because you want to whip it out and swing it.
---
&gt;  Makes me seriously sad that long time players are jumping ship 
---
They're not.  Unfortunately, a lot of them learned early that if they only reeeee a little louder, a little longer, a little more convincingly on /r/eve CCP will often give in to their demands.  So, here we are.  Again.
---
&gt;who gives a shit about krab kills?
---
Who, exactly, did you expect to be in-space during your roam?  Are we supposed to line up small groups of ships for your enjoyment instead?
---
&gt;A sandbox filled with passive, dependent players that are unable to take initiative on a personal level is a dead and stagnant sandbox.
---
What, exactly, did you think made those players krab?  Orders from on-high, or their initiative towards their own goals?
---
Enjoy your 100% safe ganks while they last.  They're exactly what you've been asking for.
---
Except a lot of that 10% are people who are indirectly running the game economy. I‚Äôm not saying I completely agree with the hardcore spodbrains out there but you have to admit that the change is weird and if it could mean the loss of that 10% of the player base who provide for most of the economy, perhaps that change should be looked at closer.
---
I was born and raised in San Diego. Beautiful city....BUT Not good for a venue like EVE. Only place I can think of to remotely entertain EVE players is the downtown Gaslamp Quarter. 
---
And HOLLY Shit would I love to see the look on everyone's face when the bartender, right about 100-130am says....LAST CALL! No 24/7 bars in San Diego. No 24/7 restaurants, No 24/7 parties.
---
Because shooting a jammer in subcaps while a hostile superfleet hazes you totally shouldn't have a reward.  
---
Also we should just remove the limit to how many jammers can be in a system like Astrahuses, which totally aren't cancer.
---
Most escalations are run in T3Cs and AFs are used in abyssal sites, but, otherwise, that's fair.
---
Why do we have a problem with risk-free farm "fun"?
---
- Risk-free farm spams the game's macroeconomy with ISK and minerals. ISK spam causes inflation, PLEX prices rising. Mineral spam causes proliferation and ultra cheap capitals, breaking game balance between capital and subcapital playstyles.
---
- Risk-free farm occurs in extremely condense umbrella space. The development of umbrellas converted Eve nullsec to a place which either there are condense regions which you'll get counterdropped titans, or vast empty regions of nothingness. This ruins the experience of anyone roaming nullsec for targets.
---
&gt;your
---
Is it normal to get grilled with several questions when applying to Dreddit?  Just like getting an actual job in RL and going through the background check.  I don't think I'll pass the drug test.
---
You know you can attack the jammer at any time, such as when the defenders can't defend it, right?
---
Whole video is a lie for three reasons:
---
1. Goon and Test are blue! r/eve told me so!
---
2. Subcaps can't kill caps/supers! r/eve told me so!
---
3. ECM doesn't work anymore! r/eve told me that as well.
---
Either all of r/eve is lying or you faked this video. And since you're in Goon you obviously hacked Hilary's e-mail server and made this fake video with a wizard hat and and scruffles nd yeah! Grr gon hat gon!
---
I agree with you.
---
I think this change for small group who can't afford 2b cyno jammers to place multiples in system this way only 1 ok. They won't have supers since only can afford on ejammer
---
nerf kikimora CCPlease
---
Which is why you then followed it up with the "right" way to play the game.  Because you were only talking about people not playing, so they....needed your advice on how to play the game they aren't playing?
---
Learn to write coherently.
---
There is sop much more nuance with the AT than what is being suggested here. 4 Weekends out of every year where players can fight in moderated matches is so far and away from having infinite instanced 3v3 pvp proving grounds that you trying to compare the 2 is just laughable...
---
&gt; this will also kill most regular cap battles
---
Citation needed.
---
well said guy
---
&gt; The reason I decided to play eve is because it is complex and hard. It  involves a lot of thinking and planing. Long term planning.
---
You will soon realize that all this long time thinking and planning is wasted time and effort because you can just join one of the big blocks, inject a few Rorqual alts and AFK mine while watching movies. The blue donut and the easy farming make the complexity of EVE a bad joke.
---
i can't really prove it, but i always felt like the loot was better in quality and quantity from frigate abyssals.
---
Yes lets not have people focused on one hellofa experience in Vegas wishing they were there.
---
Learn how to Overview noob!
---
Moving Eve Vegas to San Diego is a big mistake. I‚Äôm a Sourhern Californian and San Diego does not have the same vibe as Vegas!
---
It‚Äôs not as party oriented and does not have the same international tourism draw as Vegas.
---
What‚Äôs next? We all end up at Disneyland?
---
Well, there you got your answer. 
---
Next time pay attention to their icon on the Overview, those are called "diamond" rats for a reason.
---
You are a broken record.
---
Go do t3 at least, t4 is even better, but do them once you are confident.
---
Glad it's working out. 
---
Now we can un-nerf the rorq and carriers since all those changes that were made to help hunters only make it so easy a caveman can do it.
---
Stop being so butthurt.
---
Hahahahha, how long have you been playing this game? But I'll indulge
---
Blops and marauders, used as 10/10 DED runners (marauders sometimes even for normal ratting if really ballsy)
---
I'll give you command ships and HICs
---
T3Cs as DED runners or exploration.
---
T3Ds in HS DED/combat explo or C13 WH ratting
---
AF in frigate Abyssal running
---
You're right, there's also the fact you need a ton of meme rules to make it even remotely watchable, because eve isn't meant to be an arena team deathmatch. I'd actually say abyssal instanced PvP fits in with Eve more than the AT does.
---
I guess we changed the definition of PvP to CCP-mandated, pointless, major null-bloc conflict while I've been away.
---
Then again, judging by your flair, your "PvP" probably consists of fleet ops where the alliance hands you a muninn, you anchor on FC #461 and try to press F1 fast enough to get on kill mails.
---
I'd suggest taking a class in reading comprehension between pings.
---
Yes, let's make the cyno jammer mechanic become even more oppressive. /s
---
There's a reason that Vegas is by far the largest draw for conventions in the US. If I'm going to drop a few hundred dollars at minimum to attend an Eve event, I'm not going so I can watch a handful of PowerPoint presentations that get streamed anyways, I'm going there for the venue and the atmosphere.
---
&gt;  Didn't say anything
---
SADFACE.
---
&gt;we should talk about blackout alternatives
---
Since it's unsustainable, I think this as well. I'd suggest a local login timer where a pilot would not be able to read from or write to local (member list) until he was in system for a few minutes. He wouldn't see the residents right away but they would be blind as well. All people who were in local after that few minutes would see each other, though. Of course being talkative in local would still publish your presence on the left pane of the window even if you were not showing in the member list. 
---
&gt;Completely trashing CCP/Hilmar
---
As much fun as it is to poke him from time to time, it's been really toxic lately. People need to chill.
---
This for smaller group shouldn't effect Zerg guilds like legacy
---
Cyno off grid. Cyno system next door. Cyno on a tanked black ops and bring a fax in. Fleet battles won‚Äôt have an issue it‚Äôs the ratting carriers and rorquals that will have to adapt
---
remove the dps cap for low power structures.
---
ok sockpuppet
---
Fix 1v1 proving ground first ?
---
droping your molok on three man gang roaming your pocket is way more skilled ans elite pvp
---
&gt; Since it's unsustainable, I think this as well.
---
My personal favorite is "delayed mode" or "wormhole mode" once there is more than 10 people in the system.
---
Null bloc members leaving eve to play wow. 
---
Wow.
---
Its a problem we have seen over and over in MMOs and CCP is not one to learn from others mistakes. The bottom line is if the end game has no balance people will leave. More importantly people will not be motivated to grind to a unbalanced end game. Meaning you will not keep new players.
---
The idea of "imbalance on purpose" will make you loose both, and that is what is happening.
---
&gt;Not whining. Its the exact opposite in fact. I couldn't be happier. How could you take what I said as whining???
---
This:
---
&gt;Win button cynos were horribly unbalanced. I recognized it from the one of my first fights in null when someone dropped carriers on my 4 man cruiser gang
---
is whining.  It is what you were doing before the changes.  And the kind of whining I was referring to.
---
And this:
---
&gt;I meant they're aware that a capital response isn't happening and using cyno bait ships to pad zkill. It's using a lopsided mechanic as a win button.
---
is more whining.
---
On one hand, you could learn to identify bait ships, on the other hand you could get the devs to nerf cynos.
---
Also, this:
---
&gt;Now at least there's a "check" in that there's risk involved in deciding to escalate.
---
is not true.  Cloak a blops next to the bait and you guys still get dropped on (and you won't have enough DPS to kill the blops).  And thanks to blackout, you won't have any hint the blops is there.
---
So, your specific scenario just got worse.  The bait doesn't need to be as obvious anymore, 'cause there's another ship there for the actual cyno.
---
Yes responding to a drake on an ihub is the pvp I dream of.
---
Better yet, forming for a troll Tristan. You form and the enemy never shows up.
---
I love sov warfare.. I mean pvp.
---
I'm going to make an analysis based guesstimate of you derived from your consistent posting responses to me and general posting history, here it goes:
---
* You wear axe body spray.
---
* You use axe hair gel.
---
* You only apply hair gel without a shirt on for ultimate mirror flexes when you hit the bang's comb-up just right.
---
* You drink water at bars but order a lime and lemon to make it look like you're actually drinking.
---
* You sometimes sit to pee, not when you're out, but at home at least 50% of the time.
---
* You brag to your EVE friends about cars you have worked on / or dirt bikes.
---
How close was I?
---
&gt; especially where the carrier class is next to useless now
---
I have to agree here. I don't mind the NSA changes but the application nerf wasn't really required. These were the anti-subcap caps. They're individually very vulnerable and aren't really a threat to other caps. I almost wish they would reverse the carrier changes and kill faxes, returning them to the old fighter/drone boats with logistics.
---
First I'm happy you chose to ignore me calling you out on your math.
---
I don't have a citation for the prediction that regular cap battles will decrease significantly. Just a prediction based on how I've seen most capital escalations develop.
---
Just as you don't have a citation for your prediction that this change won't change much.
---
&gt;You really think everyone that plays this game is terrible don't you?
---
Not sure where you get that idea from but I'll answer anyway. No, I don't think that.
---
1. Because there's nothing else even remotely like it.
---
2. Yes, MMOs should be constantly changing, when they don't THAT is when they die.
---
I'd say stop introducing new ships until all of the existing ones are fully balanced.
---
Sometimes I just want to ask if you lot trust CCP so little and have so much distain for them why the heck are you playing their game and hanging around in its subreddit.
---
Then I realize I don‚Äôt care and the game doesn‚Äôt even need you.
---
They are "allowed" now...they just don't want to.
---
I see you met my Blood Gang.
---
N...not my OVERVIEW!
---
Think of all the dank subs CCP can pick up from the druggies and illegals crapping on the California sidewalks
---
Quit providing lazy comments.  It's not one or two structures that I don't personally like, it's the thousands of empty shells that have been floating in space for years.  That's not content, is just a giant pain in the a**.
---
If you don't sit down to pee at home you're living life wrong tbh.  
---
This is the hill I'm prepared to die on.
---
Another fantastic Lorenzo post
---
I'd be happy to try them both. Maybe put one model in half the regions and the other in the rest and see how it works. 
---
That or chaos it up and have two weeks of one and then the other. SISI is nice but there's not enough population on long enough to get a good feel for a change like this.
---
Do you just not want new players in the game? Abyssal runners are not doing them instead of going on roams, they are doing abyssal sites instead of not playing at all
---
And I don't disagree with you but looking at it from a perspective of a newbro just sticking their toes into the water it would seem that way. I would also like to see how old some of these new players are because if they are young say 16-20 they didnt grow up with video games like you and I did. I'm in my 30s I remember grinding and grinding on games to gey anything decent and it felt like an achievement and I am sure you feel the same way. But that mindset isnt present now the same way it was with us.
---
Posts on Reddit, thinks flair means something.
---
Even for smaller groups, I would argue against this. Smaller groups who want to go on the offensive will have to deal with a formed up defender with (potential) cap coverage without being able to jump their own caps in.
---
I think that would become very oppressive fast
---
Well eve works like a butterfly effect small changes can have huge repercussions. Nerfing everything isn't the answer that just makes the grind harder.
---
People want huge battles but limit caps.
---
The nul blocks make to much limit resources.
---
There umbrella remove local and cyno changes
---
They all hurt small alliances way more than the big blocks.
---
One way doing it may be putting a limit on the amount titans allowed in a system at one time. Say 15 titans to each side, But have unlimited sub caps allowed.
---
Also make sub caps more efficient at combating caps make t2 marauders useless at sub cap combat awesome at combating dreads and carriers.
---
Stuff like that..
---
Well played on adapting. Only a week till cyno changes!
---
It's only risk free because you choose not to engage... you want a complete change so you can kill in virtual safe mode... get fucked!
---
Stain Guy beat you to it
---
not if he birthed a poster like that
---
Geez, you're right, your four killmails prove to me that there are no low-power structures out there after all.  They all got blown up because they're legitimate content.
---
Wow, my bad, sorry my dude.
---
taking a bubble bath doesn't count Elise
---
If you want to argue that artificially inflated difficulty caused by overly strong mobs causes a game to be hard then you might want to add mor'ladim to your list, besides that i don't really agree with this view.  
---
Calling basic orientation "good 3D orientation skills" is a bit of a stretch aswell.  
---
Scholo and LBRS - debatable (LBRS actually not really tho aslong as you were careful) 
---
And the amount of mechanics at Ragnaros was a joke. Period.
---
Intelligent, well-thought out response, as usual.  All feedback is appreciated, thanks.
---
Alright dude. Im feeling pretty good about things. Sucks you're not. If feeling super stoked about the future of this game is whining I guess you nailed it.
---
Before Citadels, there was the same excuse  with anchored POS's on every moon in every system, same problem, same solution, either get out there killing them or just remove them from your overview, either way your whining is pathetic.
---
4 killmails? okay why dont you press the links before breathing through your mouth at me.
---
I‚Äôd like that, but that has more to do with the limitations of viable fitting in a 1v1 cruiser scenario. It‚Äôs just too easy to find ‚Äúthe perfect fit‚Äù. 3v3 I would hope has many more levels of choices which would make it harder to ‚Äúsolve‚Äù and hopefully get more of a rock, paper scissors meta
---
The math wasn't wrong though.
---
So that's not really calling anyone out.
---
But if we're talking about major cap escalations, drilling into super data is going to be quite a bit easier.
---
Do you have the data for capitals by comparison?
---
&gt; No, I don't think that.
---
Then why are you so positive people won't figure out that they can light multiple cynos at once to better secure an entry point on a hostile grid?
---
I‚Äôm very new to the game, and only a few weeks ago moved from high sec security missions to a null sec corp.
---
No idea what cyno‚Äôs are and what changed about them, and most discussion is between people that have been dealing with these for a long while it seems. Anyone care to give me a quick rundown in laymans terms?
---
Decloak at 50k, point to 128, light, profit?
---
Im happy you learned you could bait just as easily as before :) Congrats.
---
They did before caps, just sayin...
---
So apart from the niche uses for each ship, which ships are used in industrial scale isk making by nullblocks? The late VNI, current Myrmidon and Domis, Ishtars, Carriers and Supers. (Dreads in WH) and Boson Titans in Delve.
---
Yeah but didn't they say that they were instead going to San Diego in 2020?
---
If they wanted to shake things up and go east coast, Orlando is a great party city.
---
unanchored pos towers could be grabbed tho
---
Then if they want to pvp regularly then they can go out and interact with the world like the rest of us do. There is no purpose to adding the Frigate 3v3 other than to say "I am either too scarred, lazy or both to go to lowsec and sit in a novice with my friends..." Unless you can think of a better reason?
---
stop being a lazy fuck and do something then , be the change you want to see. 
---
‚Äúdelete citadels because their low power‚Äù please, atleast make a good suggestion like taking out damage cap. but no you just want the easy way out right. cause fixing overview is tooooo hard
---
Apologies to everyone on the board - I had no idea so many people considered empty, defenseless structures as legitimate content.  Padding killboards with abandoned structures is serious business, I guess -  I meant no offense.
---
True... The 2 or so years before... :)
---
&gt; And yes, the artist formerly known as CCP Guard will be joining us for the performance in Vegas!
---
Did you just upload this because it included the word "unsubbing"?
---
Also, I would call this potato quality, but that would be an insult to potatoes.
---
Yeah thats fucking stupid. I look forward to that shit every year. :(
---
&gt;Cyno off grid. 
---
* Caps take a long time to align, especially when you get all the bumping you're gonna get in this size of capital fleet.  Which means they're gonna be able to scan down and bubble *part* of your fleet.  Which then means you can't warp, or you're gonna be warping in piecemeal and dying.
---
   * Timers run at real-world speed despite TiDi.  Keeping you off-grid for 30 real-life minutes while your titans slow down from the massive bumps and align mean they win the timer.  That's going to be pretty easy in max-TiDi.
---
* You can only warp to 0 on the enemy fleet because they bubbled themselves.  Warping to zero is a bad idea.  Positioning is extremely important because bubbles, lag, disconnects and triage/siege mean you aren't moving after the battle is joined.
---
&gt;Cyno system next door
---
Because nothing could possibly go wrong with trying to gate a massive capital fleet.
---
Also includes the problems of "cyno off grid" if you manage to actually get through the gate.  Coupled with your opponent knowing exactly where you are going to warp from.
---
&gt;Cyno on a tanked black ops and bring a fax in
---
BLOPs can get to about 400kEHP with a relatively sane fit.  If you're insane, you can get to 600kEHP.  That dies instantly when holding still on a grid full of enemy supers.  Fax doesn't do any good when the blops is dead before you leave the warp tunnel.
---
Right now, we use suicide cyno interceptors to get in the right position, then get 1-5 caps through to it's cyno before it dies (the game really doesn't work reliably when the grid's that full, so "be better at jumping" doesn't mean you can get any more caps through).  This works because those 1-5 caps have their own cyno to get the rest of the fleet in.  Without those cynos, it's 1-5 dead caps.
---
&gt;Fleet battles won‚Äôt have an issue
---
Considering all your solutions don't work, I'd suggest this claim is not true.
---
Just don't use caps CCP just going to nerf super and titan dmg to subcapitals and then gg ez fix
---
My partner's a big WoW nerd. She told me it had both higher peak viewership and higher peak player numbers. I didn't bother to double check because I really don't care that much about WoW.
---
Nah, remove excavators and let them use normal drones. Panic should go as well, but speaking to people who hunt whales they see it as a challenge so idk.
---
The alternative solution would be if ccp keeps trying to nerf the nul blocks is for the big three coalitions to declare war on high sec. Just pick the biggest hi sec corps/alliances and which them complain when they see war has been declared by test, horde, goons. They have the isk to declare war on them all and force them to Dock up for a week.
---
Kinda like a legal burn jita and hulkaggeddon thing rolled into one.
---
&gt;Ok, what in your opinion are issues? Genuinely curious
---
Too few possible cyno ships, so any sort of bait is heavily projected unless you're static to one system.
---
T2 cruiser hulls are prohibitively expensive and limit offensive use of caps (especially when moving into position), while barely hurting defensive build + buy cap in home region and blob playstyles.
---
Many hunting ships that rely on cynos have been hit way too hard, super hunter HICs, cap hunter dictors to name a few. Solution is N+1 accounts which is pretty dumb and makes everything less fun.
---
Rorqual panic still hasn't been addressed, so umbrellas can still operate pretty easily. Especially when rorqs and the like are typically alt ships - so just keep your main in a bricked falcon cloaked within fax range. When you cyno just RR him with your rorq blob since 1 rorq rep = ~1 scimi.
---
Cheers, thank you

So can unanchored citadels,  but that is not what he is complaining about.  Like a anchored, but offline tower, it still has to be shot and destroyed to be removed.  Like a POS, there is the chance for something of value to drop be it P4 Items, Fuel Blocks, whatever.  In WH space they are virtual loot pinatas.
---
unanchored citadels can be swiped too.
---
Reported.  Good day.

explain (in detail) why eve is hard in 2019
---
I can't sell my bathwater if I pee in the bath tho

Here's the deal: At the moment Eve's player base can strip entire regions clear of resources on a daily basis. Empires aren't migratory, they establish a domain and harvest resources within. In the case of real life, harvest rate is far outstripped by supply, allowing a communal entity to acquire resources from one location at a steady rate. In order to mirror this concept in-game, you'd have to increase the current stockpile of harvestable resources several hundred thousand times over. That means a rorqual will be mining the same rock for 8 hours today that he/she was mining all day yesterday and the day before that. Resources would not respawn at all though, so it would be about a final all-out push to secure all the vast but limited resources you could and profit from that monopoly until the servers went down. That is what you are asking for. There is no great wilderness to conquer in Eve, no where to go when resources would be over taxed. The principle of resources respawning has allowed an entity to establish a domain that is limited and simply be satisfied with a "this is all we need" mentality. Migratory existences would discourage stabilization of a region, because what's the point of build infrastructure when you will just be moving on later? It encourages a lousy mentality, taking all the resources you can and moving on. It won't shake up the meta, the largest force will still be the most effective at subjucating a region and stripping it bare. The real problem comes from the inherent difficulty of maintaining production, since you have to move your base every couple of months. At worst, this whole idea just drives more players away from the game and the population dwindles more. The only limited resources in Eve is man-power, and that is certainly worth fighting for.

Holy shit you really just don‚Äôt get it. Yes all the reasons are outlined above. Please train reading comprehension to 1 before posting.

It's always been about the player numbers really, nobody reading those articles knows what the fuck a supercarrier is.

oh no did you get offended? good now get out and take your bad post with you
---
First you  claim that CCP has catered too much to the PvE  players over the last 5 years and in the very next sentence claim that there has been a large drop in PvE players.
---
The sad truth is that CCP  threw few dev crumbs to the PvE community; the majority of it was gameplay or additions not asked for, attempts to push solo players into groups, or meeting PvE demands from large null sec alliances. They destroyed the birthing creche of HS with their lack of attention, such that when replacement NS players were needed, the supply was too limited. We saw what was happening over the last 5+ years, but were constantly blown off by both CCP and the CSM. The EVE ecosystem was destroyed by CCP arrogance and CSM indifference over a long period, it's only now that the damage comes apparent. Good luck trying toright the ship.

Take my up vote and be gone.

playstyles have been killed for years now and yes they had/have a right to complain. not to sure of the "big batles" the big blocs wont have to much trouble getting those cynos up. and since they happen like what every 1.5 years should we cater to only those fights or cater to the day to day experience.

If you give me 5mil SP in injectors I will activate my 30mi sp account and fly with you

When I started playing Eve there weren't even rats in asteroid belts.  In fact there were no rats at all.  We mined in noob ships.  I have no idea what the rest of your comment is about as I didn't bother reading it.
---
&gt;  Winning comes from
---
Yes, I realised this when I saw Goons had 1,000 Titans and CCP had devalued being a "veteran" so much most of NC/PL were playing some other game, completely unable to contest them.
---
I'm doubting it's a nano gang that's being bridged in, so it need to be some arty one-instant-and-the-gank's-over setup or the victim can still just use the headstart to run away.
---
Ill reply because its you.
---
Risk free farm is risk free when hunters quit trying and not before, rorqs die daily to hunters who go to kill rorqs.  Same with supers and titans. Higher risk doesnt do shit all to faucets because it just makes people turtle harder (i know its your agenda to want easier kills so try and set that aside, trust me, it won't create longevity)... as for "macroeconomy with isk and minerals" yes. People play the game and generate shit into the game. Blue loot, mission loot, mining, if more is produced than CONSUMED then it causes inflation. 
---
The issue isnt faucets. It's lack of sinks because "pvp" is flying 25mil ships nowadays and spamming "null is safe".
---
Umbrellas exist BECAUSE of the "risk" of nullsec. If you're ROAMING NULLSEC FOR TARGETS youre roaming into space people have "spent" trillions, tens of trillions of isk to fortify and prepare for your 25mil-100mil frig swarm.  Your risk-free hunting playstyle is why umbrellas are so effective, you're lazy.  As are other hunters.  If you choose to fight the biggest guy in the room, bring a weapon that can wound him before he squishes you into the ground at least... or prepare, train, do ANYTHING other than "i got my new bomber im omw delve CCP PLZ NERF"
---
you say you dont hate pve?
---
- Your ENTIRE platform is built around hating pve
---
- So you're lazy, that is nobody's problem or fault. Mining isnt fun, so you dont want to do it.. .but you want to punish others for patiently doing so
---
- You hate all big null groups, but your hate boner for goons i think blinds your rational judgment.  
---
- You are bitter vets who want to ruin someone else's game WITHOUT TRYING... be a true eve masochist and put in effort to do actual damage
---
- You literally want changes to make pve as tedious and gruelling as possible with *no* changes to hunting being undock, cloak, and wait to press f1.  So yes, it is because of that, or your ENTIRE post history is a lie.
---
&gt; Making rorqs have fighter mechanics instead of drone ones sounds like a decent idea to me.
---
\&gt;   Making rorqs have fighter mechanics instead of drone ones sounds like a decent idea to me. 
---
No its a terrible idea, lock rock press F1, tab to next rorq, target rock and press F1, tab to next rorq. By the time you get back to the first rorq the excavators would have just returned. The fighter mechanic works because rats die very quick, roids don't
---
Is lowsec so difficult its not even on the list? 
---
Also, that nullsec line should have been below low since 2015 and then went back up inbetween low/medium in 2019.

Things like this with forced scarcity, changing the cyno meta and other chaos changes will only force people together. There is rarely a reason presented that wouldn't result in me going to a bigger group instead of a smaller one. When you bring in uncertainty, people are going to want stability and they're going to find it in big groups.
---
Since many only stay because of sunk cost fallacy the game would propably die for real
---
The math was definitely wrong, even according to yourself. Super battles don't happen vs I found 2 in the last 3 months.
---
It's exactly because I think Eve players aren't stupid that I think that won't happen. As many people in this thread have tried to get across, the caps on grid have a massive advantage so the other side won't want to take the risk lighting multiple cynos, maybe getting a few caps through each and losing the 300m cyno ships.
---
No vegas 2020
---
Chaos era btw
---
I'd love to know the rationale for pivoting over from Vegas to San Diego.  I'm not second guessing the choice, I'm just curious as to why they relocated the most popular EVE meet outside of Reykjavik 300 miles.  
---
I'm assuming it just hit a critical mass of people such that venues were no longer big enough to sustain the meet at its current price point, and the meets were too small to hit the "mega conference" status.  
---
Maybe it's because Vegas isn't really a family town, so it wasn't including that demographic, and that's where they're spreading the love to?  That could make sense, San Diego is way more family friendly.
---
At the end of the day, I've no doubts there will continue to be EVE meets in Vegas (official or otherwise) come 2020.
---
&gt; Risk free farm is risk free when hunters quit trying and not before
---
Risk is a function of humans plus the mechanics. If mechanics aren't part of the function, then why are you complaining about mechanical changes?
---
&gt; Umbrellas exist BECAUSE of the "risk" of nullsec
---
The question is not whether the nullsec risk mitigation takes player effort or not. We already accept that it does. The question is how much of the risk you should be able to mitigate with maximum player effort. We defend there should still be a minimum risk.
---
&gt; you say you dont hate pve? - Your ENTIRE platform is built around hating pve
---
Thats just your echo chamber and koolaid speaking.
---
Imagine referring to the name of an eve character as *real* name

---
How did POTBS end up on a graph? Former player would like to know lol
---
Hahahahahah, I'll ask the question from my previous post again. You haven't played Eve for very long, have you?
---
Most of those ships are actually used quite a bit for making ISK, maybe except the Blops/marauder.
---
Its game-wide, not just blops drops.
---
I have made over 20bn isk in an astero on a 5m sp account.  That account has not lost a single ship.  It solely explores in npc and sov nullsec.
---
It would be abused by skill farms (those accounts you strangely call "your friends") far more than used by new players. The later need to log in frequently to keep their skill queue running, which is exactly what every game company likes new players to do.
---
I see you ran out of talking points and went right into dumpster semantics. Kudos on shitting the bed.
---
Hey fuck you. cloaking is SO HARD. have you ever tried to aim a bomb then warp away?  Or shoot an unexpecting hopefully afk pve player?
---
It takes far more skill and effort than you'd ever imagine.  Like, imagine if instead of spending trillions of isk on ihub upgrades, fuel sheets and logistics to make giant webs of defense you had to GO TO JITA OR LOWSEC AND BUY A BOMBER
---
it isnt that simple either. you have to buy the ammo too, thats a big part, and figure out how to use it. THEN you cant even KILL capitals because theyre op so you have no other choice but to play with other people and teach them how to launch the torpedos, and YOU CANT EVEN DO THAT WITHOUT DYING WHICH IS BULLSHIT.  Honestly hunting is so hard, you cant even kill capitals any more without losing a few frigates. 
---
Imagine. Just try to imagine taking all the isk and time and planning in defense and instead put that into hunting ratting myrms or cloaking to watch for someone being afk.  Then you'll see exactly why hilmar and the best and smarted eve players on reddit are DEMANDING justified nerfs to defenses so their high intensity and effort-filled gameplay can be rewarded at defender's expense.
---
i agree, i hope its an oversight by ccp else its dumb that alpha's can't use it.
---
see you made your own fate. i started in an mining/indie corp that sent me to null within 2 weeks of me being in game. by 40 days i was pvping and flying stuff. anyway then i went to hs and went few times to null back. joined signal cartel left did my own stuff joined friends and so on.
---
make your own fate :)
---
Then maybe make titan/capital skills non-injectible?
---
Tell your friends to stop being cheap and sub. Problem solved.
---
I'm open to other ideas to make any part of ISK generating be less AFK so if you have any I'm all ears.
---
Dam your fucking salty. The reason is because they want 3v3. Good luck getting that in the wild. Not to mention the time they will have to spend finding a fight.
---
"My" guys? Are you talking about Stuka fleets? You realise that the standard fleet fit stuka bomber has the cloak offlined, and about 20-40% of the fleet aren't even cloaking. And Stuka is absolutely a brawling doctine - everything happens within 50km.
---
Stuka isn't a thing because of cloaking.
---
But doesnt cost money
---
I'd say it depends on the target and what you're bringing but I can see a use for lighting at 50-100k.  Dont forget if you lit a cov ops the arazu only has to sit for 30s.  If you cant do 2.2-2.5k/s you are still pointed when the arazu can chase you.  That's assuming he lit at 50k on a single target who aligns to something warpable in the exact opposite direction of the point.
---
And remove the killboard all together... wanna see people undock and go destroy ships, remove the thing that keeps them from doing it.
---
People are absolutely claiming that actually. They demand juicy targets caught be unable to bring in reinforcements and give them time to kill the target before a defence can be formed. This exactly what was demanded and we got it.
---
I'm now able to scout moons that are about to pop, when I find one I just park a toon cloaked in a sabre at a ping, and continue scouting for more. Nobody knows I'm there. Targets harvested are ones who don't have numbers to blob us out, and within minutes of their rorquals arriving, I ping a drek fleet, nerds log in, we wormhole over and murder them, occator up all the loot and everyone goes home and logs off.
---
It is nearly effortless now with blackout beyond looking for the weakest targets and there is no way for them to know I'm there. If it weren't for the idiots blinging out their rorqs and still using excavators, I probably wouldnt even bother anymore that's how easy it is. The same goes for carriers/supers ratting
---
This game was never so easy to kill rorqs and supers and its going to get many times easier now? That's hilarious. Back in the day we sprung complex traps which required coordinated efforts from multiple people, secrecy, days weeks sometimes months of scouting, spies, just to kill a single super or titan. And those kills were so damn rewarding that they still come up in conversation today, they inspired morale, and inspired others to learn the art of hunting supers. Now it's not an art, it's log in, find a wormhole, dunk on some unsuspecting dude, go home.
---
Casual trash players masquerading as pvpers, that won't dare fly anything riskier than a bomber and expect these rewards within their reach with minimal-zero effort. Makes me laugh
---
This kind of change would/could require more delegation or it would burn out leaders continuously, especially if there would be a max number of structures or max number of owned sov systems implemented along with it. Imagine if you can't through all three regions worth of systems in one mini-alliance full of entosis toons. maybe your logistics mini-alliance can't support all of the structures that you own. Maybe someone forgets to check his third holding alt, and... whoops autopay wasn't set to on. Maybe there's a couple too many master chefs in the kitchen.
---
I'm just curious if this would create friction. I've seen that, both on a micro (corp/small alliance) level, and with people like Gigx or Sort Dragon, in Eve. 
---
Not saying it's a perfect idea or a perfect solution (or hell even a good one), but I don't think it should be disregarded quite that quickly.
---
Ya kinda got baited here.
---
Eve is all about some people throwing randoms ideas that range from absolutely horrific to mildly amusing, surrounded in an ocean of shitposters, angry null carebears, entitled small gangers and clueless lowsec inhabitants.
---
A magical substance that is poison to the eve community...
---
It's called logic and rationality
---
I think the issue is mismanagement.  Eve became a way for CCP to fund other projects, ie World of Darkness, Dust 514, Project Nova, VR etc.  all have been scrapped possibly due to their business model? They ended up closing a bunch of studios. None of the original founders have been part of CCP since 2015. Then they sold CCP to a Korean company.  
---
Server numbers aren't necessarily a good comparison metric. For example I'd have 8 retrievers, charon, and orca, and when they banned isboxer I went back to 3 accounts. 2 of them for a time were afk off-grid boosters till they changed that then it became 1 account.
---
I've spent months building my rorqual emprie now ccp just nerf nerf nerfs it. who else is with me on making lawsuit to force ccp to refund my injettors
---
Your right, to many FC's are overly concerned about being judged by their killboard instead of fun per hour, so they become risk adverse.

I like that idea a lot, more things that are even no matter the player count is good.  Also creates a target if there are competing small groups in the same constellation.
---
There is none. Its a shit answer but its the truth. The PVE in EVE is setup to be boring as hell and as a result  AFKable. You could remove excavators and skill injectors, limiting both the ore mined and the number of new pilots able to fly rorqs, but I cant see this current iteration of CCP doing either.
---
I'm just curious what role you had in building up Delve to be what it is today?
---
I have only played since 2012, so I might still be a noob in your bittervet eyes.
---
How often do you get a 10/10 to do? How often are you in HS running DED sites? You just conceded the Blops/marauder, that just leaves frig abyssals.
---
Tbh the cruiser abyssals tend to be run more often where I come from, so wont really know how lucrative frig abyssals are. Never been in WH but know dreads and nestors are the mutt's nuts for isk making...
---
I mean, your talking point was "look at how badass i am using my videogame name in an internet forum" so it wasn't easy to find something on the same niveau.
---
I'm calling it now, next year CCP is going to announce moving EVE Down Under to Antarctica.
---
Imagine smug laughing while your player count is the lowest it's been since 2005 lmao
---
Evidenced by spodbrains afk mining all day. At least wow you actually have to play the game.
---
Risk is a human function, which is why my statement stands. Why do you want mechanical changes if you can create risk via human functions?
---
I've checked the post blackout MER. 
---
How much risk should be mitigated by effort, how much effort should be REMOVED to apply risk?  You're so focused on the latter, don't pretend to give a fuck about the former.
---
No. You're literally a psychopath who doesn't listen or comprehend anything beyond your circlejerk of "NULL IS BAD BECAUSE FUCK SAFETY" without even knowing what safety means.  Balance between playstyles shouldn't be a krab farming for 1000 hours to be able to compete with your 5 minute jita shopping spree.  Balance shouldn't be years of building up to lose to someone who thinks cloaking is the only viable strategy to hunt.  Balance shouldn't be someone spending 1000 mining hours ona a ship that you think should be nerfed because "some people are too poor to afford supers" and no other rationality.  Your ENTIRE stance is based on a megalomaniac perspective of koolaid chugging circlejerks for zkill stats and nothing else, and you KNOW it's true
---
You have to actually play the same instead of sitting afk in a belt.
---
Nope. My talking point was exactly what I said. You are ashamed to show your name and real flair. I was pretty straight forward in what I said.
---
Anyway... This is besides the point. We were talking about ppl specifically injecting into supers as being a problem...
---
Should have read tos and eula, none of the mentioned are actually yours üòÅ
---
shame thats not how the law works here... ccp cannot take away my rorqual
---
And yet I don't really remember it being radically busier back then. Tis really annoying we can't actually know the "real" player count over the last 5 years.
---
Even blops are used in some DED sites because the biggest risk of a DED ship is gating which blops can avoid
---
Excuse me, but I don't think those words mean what you think they mean.
---
Stopped reading at " this is a pvp game". Filed away under the "Your playstyle is invalid" bin.
---
CCP kicked old players in the nuts, so I can't blame them leaving.
---
vOv
---
Name 2 playstyles ccp intentionally killed in the past.
---
Personally not much anymore but I've seen people around me run basically only 10/10s. Up to 10 per day
---
I've tried AF in Abyssals for a while and they are actually very good at it and can make a very decent amount of ISK.
---
For C5/6 WH dreads and Nestor/Leshak/Rattles are the default. For lower class and especially C13 running T3Ds (especially the Confessor) are the default since you can't take caps in there
---
Half the people posting on /r/eve havn't played eve in 5+ years.  Ignore what you read here, it is a vehicle for alliance level meta-gaming in eve.
---
I don't have the time to roam for 5+ hours to find content.
---
Skill farms need omega anyway, soooo....
---
&gt; Who, exactly, did you expect to be in-space during your roam? Are we supposed to line up small groups of ships for your enjoyment instead?
---
i don¬¥t roam blocspace. will either lead to hours of boredom, unfightable cap blobs or cheap kills that feel like kicking a baby in the face. overall a waste of time for everyone involved. 
---
&gt; What, exactly, did you think made those players krab?
---
non existent personal effort vs acceptable rewards.
---
Not until they reach the extracting treshold, no point in paying for omega before that.
---
Skill farming has been a problem long before this change, and skill points have already been cheapened due to the hard work of many. I wouldn't be so paranoid of my intentions, but I can see why making it easier could lead to abuse. That being said how much worse would it be? Is using mobile truly the most effective platform for large scale abuse as you expect? 
---
Forcing new players (Who already may be struggling to grasp the game) to endure tedium to prevent farming or increase metrics seems ineffective, perhaps self destructive.
---
IRL has resource scarcity. 
---
IRL does not have constant world wars.
---
Naw, I figure the Eve whales will meet at SeaWorld San Diego to air their grievances of mistreatment. There's always a porpoise for CCP's plans.
---
Stage in a better area?
---
In my old corp the guys would chain havens in a Hel and do 100mil ticks. In complete safety, not having to put in any effort other than to warp in, align out to Fort, deploy fighters and remembering to align to new haven as soon as last wave spawns. No brains required and no risk of dying.
---
And these dudes all injected their supers. Every single one of them... Because why use anything (or brains) else...
---
Player strength used to be determined by looking at the age of the character. That went away when Skill injectors got released. As far as single PVP you have to memorize all the ships in your class, know what counters you, then you have to see the model of their guns to determine if they are short or long range, are you short or long range, do you orbit or fly at an angle,  while managing overheat, nanopaste and manually piloting. It's complicated. It's easy to take out more expensive ships when they don't know what they are doing.  
---
As far as Spreadsheets in space the game is written in Stackless Python 2
---
You have to cultivate interest to get subs.
---
Wonderful post. This is the eve I see as a new player, and I don't want anything to do with it. Killing the Agamand family solo in Classic WOW yesterday was more challenging than any of my Krabs kills were.
---
Sad to see Vegas go. It was a great excuse to party out once a year. 
---
San Diego is ok, but meh. Definitely does not have the same vibe as Vegas. Living in SoCal it‚Äôs basically next door to me, but it‚Äôs definitely not as appealing to me. 
---
Also, they say they‚Äôre doing this to pick up new players; by moving to literally the corner of the country?
---
First of all, I was making a joke about your intentions, go find yourself some sense of humor.
---
That being said, it would be far more easy to skill up future farms with a cellphone than having to log them in and out one by one.
---
And giving an incentive to log in is hardly "forcing" someone to do anything... in fact, if they don't it won't be the end of the world (I fail to understand the neurosis built around small ammounts of SP); and if a new player "endures tedium" by loggin into the game they will stop playing and that's it, no mobile app will change that.
---
The same role hunters have in bringing balance to eve.  Fuck all
---
Personally as someone on the side that ended up going ‚Äúoh well there‚Äôs the fax, time to hope they‚Äôre stupid enough to fly out of fax reps range‚Äù I really hope they don‚Äôt add faxes to cyno. Faxes get hull energizers, Insane local tank, and well fit are near impossible to neut out without multiple dedicated neut ships. Changes make it harder to escalate to capitals with an on grid cyno, which is a fine change by me. You want a cyno on grid you either have to pray your squishy recon doesn‚Äôt get blapped, or commit a blops which also may get blapped, OR offgrid cyno, which lets the attacking gang set up drag bubbles to prepare the grid. IMO it doesn‚Äôt make shit like UALX things not happen, as you can still prestage stuff for the attackers, and defenders now have the cyno beacon things to work with. Sure you can‚Äôt just fax/dread cyno, EHE and get your titan/super fleet in automatically (I know it wasn‚Äôt this easy per the other dudes comment but point stands I think)
---
That chart is from before there were alpha accounts. It's not characters. The data for the graphs was based on the main of each account. CCP quant used to have all kinds of great data on the makeup of the player base.
---
Just using them in the context you guys are :p
---
You want an area like environment for small gang pvp that cant be interfered with, I am asking you to justify why it needs to be instanced other than for the reason of "I dont like how small ganginging currently works because it's too time/thought/resource intensive"

Nah it's below the graph.

Ironically there are similar lawsuits in other games....

But unless you get it to go class action it will go nowhere.

And please don't anyways. It's a pathetic way to handle anything in regards to games

are you high on crack? the game anywhere outside the remaining blocs is a fucking barren wasteland compared to even 3-4 years ago. not even talking about the pre 2013 era.

There's plenty of supers being used all over the place. Even outside of Delve. Just got to pay attention.

---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but with proper planning you can take one down in under 2 days in wh space and just under 4 days in null/low. Check the reinforcement day and time by hacking the structure. First timer is always 22-50 hours, second timer is at least 0.5/2.5/5.5 days depending on sec, with only highsec being potentially a week+. I can say from experience most null groups(the ones doing a lot of the complaining) just attack blindly and then get flustered when they take over a week to get the job done.

I'm not saying the system can't be better, far from it. But if people bothered to understand how it works and actually planned around it, it would be a lot more bearable to many. Hell, I don't think any of the bastion FCs I flew with in my time there know that structures can even be hacked.
---
You made a point
---
Pick your flavor of PvE, then join spectre fleet NPSI for pvp, or roam FW space solo.
---
Probably the same as my rorquals, you troll
---
But you said you didn't do anything to take or build up Delve?
---
So the once-per-year fights that only destroy 10% of the assets on grid and take 12 hours in tidi to play out might not happen as often.
---
Oh no.
---
Don't get me wrong. I was in the test super battles last year. Levi, fax alts and dread alts. It was worth doing a few times. But ... Lol.
---
You can do this big boy i believe in you
---
Most skill farms are already set up and running full steam. So your argument is kinda moot.
---
The blackout made me resub after 3 years. I've already cancelled the September payment, the game is too empty.
---
It's so little, so late, for a game so rotten for so long. The community treating it like if it's the end of the world is one of the most discouraging parts.
---
Apparently you don't understand hyperbolic statements, but that's okay, I guess.
---
&gt;  the caps on grid have a massive advantage
---
Yeah, sure, the handful of caps have an advantage. Which they should.
---
But it's not remotely impossible to deal with.
---
&gt; lighting multiple cynos, maybe getting a few caps through each and losing the 300m cyno ships
---
Hardly. Even in your world where FCs in the middle of a fight can accurate recognize have their entire fleet lock onto a new ship faster than someone can right click &gt; jump, each cyno would exponentially increase the success of the entire.
---
And 300m cyno ships hardly matter in this world where people are dropping 50 person capital fleets.
---
Apparnetly people are too poor for 300m cynos but totally space rich enough to engage in "massive capital brawls."
---
YOUR PURPLE IS THE WRONG SHADE OF PURPLE
---
It makes the hunter's risk very low, yes. If I sit 2k off a gate in Dairy Queen system, your staging (don't remember the name). I'm going to get popped. If I do the same thing with a cloak active, not only am I extremely unlikely to be killed but no one will ever know I was there.
---
That's a pretty extreme level of low risk.
---
[am i though?](https://imgur.com/6pcLrns)
---
oh my sad how good is that.
---
No.  Your definition of *my* definition of pvp is what hunters what
---
Which is pvp on their terms with their benefit. They want minimal effort for big impact and favor tilted that way.
---
In any sandbox game you have to spend time and effort to kill other well built groups.  If you don‚Äôt like it in eve you won‚Äôt like it anywhere else except WoW and similar games that‚Äôll allow you to have ‚Äúeven‚Äù opponents.
---
I have 15 rorquAL accounts and i injected 12 of those with rela money each took me about 25b (including fit) 
---
it took me about $3000 of plex to poay for my rorquals. i have no job so this is lots of money for me. it is not fair
---
Bait post is bait.
---
so you're just a leech?
---
I can see most of your points, even though I disagree with some. We'll see how it plays out.
---
BTW, did I just see you advocate that a small group of caps should have an advantage? Cause that seems out of character
---
I did not find it funny, and its my fault. You're being rude over nothing. 
---
If you are preventing them from using other means, you are forcing them to use the only option.
---
I'm sorry you don't understand the neurotic properties of wanting my friends to be able to fly what they want.   
---
I find that players typically login to play games.  
---
If the sp isn't a big deal, isn't the system hopelessly oppressive to new players?
---
My lawyer will be in touch COMMENT THIEF
---
Good post, but it‚Äôs true.
---
Now people like Olmeca just scream political buzzwords ‚Äúsafety‚Äù ‚Äúchaos‚Äù ‚Äúdanger‚Äù and people flock because it‚Äôs piss easy compared to how hunting has historically been done.
---
&gt;  That was fixing a loophole, an exploit. You cant compare that to removing local or changing cynos.
---
People used instant local as an intel tool. It was never supposed to be one. So taking it away from null was fixing a loophole. Same could be said about cynos. Having able to light a cyno with any shitty ship is a loophole and bad gameplay.
---
&gt;These things arent the fault of NS man. I get it, its nice to have someone to blame and NS hasnt always played nice so perhaps we deserve shit. So give us shit, but please remember that the issues we have are due to CCPs lack of actually maintaining the game.
---
And now they are finally starting to fix the mechanics. I'm sure they will nerf rorquals heavily also. Nullsec used to be this hardcore endgame content area. Lately it's turned into safe farming heaven where even new players have been able to farm massive amounts of isk.
---
&gt;I wouldnt be arguing against these changes if I for one second belived they would work. But I know they wont, I wish it would honestly, but the issues are far bigger than can be fixed by pulling a switch.
---
Changes have already helped a lot what I've seen. Isk farming and botting has gone down huge amount. And null feels bit more dangerous place again. After they change cynos and other stuff it will get even better.
---
Ouch, right in the Alliance Tournament feels!
---
Your assumptions are so myopic it's painful.  First of all: The whole argument of resource depletion is not that a system now permanently has finite resource, that is obviously dumb.  The point is that has either: steady resource development (a site spawns, say, every 30 minutes to a cap of 10) or as you complete sites in one system, a new site appears somewhere else in your region or constellation.  This would still be tremendously bountiful but it would require people to move around making defense harder, which is the stated goal of CCP right now. 
---
Null is currently, and has historically been, vastly uninhabited with large entities largely just slapping down sov to create buffer space or to secure trade routes.  If you look at how any alliance uses it's space you'll find that theres 1-2 heavy ratting systems and maybe 3-10 others that get some visitation.  The rest is abandoned and exists solely to "control" the area.  It's space that would be far more enjoyable if people had a reason to visit it.
---
If I remember it was initially just a player gathering it was only the second one where CCP realized it was a great thing for the community. The first had a huge nut it needed to fulfill before the Hotel would even reserve the conference space. 
---
It's strange to me that the organizers would shut it down even with CCP taking a smaller role in its advertising and support. 
---
Strange times are afoot.
---
Personally I'd like to be addressed by my propper title of 'Capsuleer'
---
The core game hasn't really changed that much. It's still a tactical space submarine mmo simulator :)
---
Issue is no point to bash
---
look ccp has a good product it is just time and again they show a lasck of understanding the players of the game. 
---
take citadels rorquals and injectors we said these things would be bad and look.  CCP can't balance things it nerf to shit or buff to op
---
But...but...they're not allowed!
---
I like how you 1/3rd‚Äôd the avg isk per hour in ns for subcap pve just to try to push your agenda
---
&gt;thinking hunting was only like 5% harder than nullbear gameplay in 2018
---
my sides need a warpin we got GTFOd off grid
---
I'm having a hard time to sign in with my Google play account, it spins forever
---
I have reinstalled both, eve and Google play but I won't let me sign in
---
Any suggestions what else I could try?
---
cant see shit with no local. As i can tell only one botter didnt left :D
---
Only answering to the capital point, you are right when you say rebalance should be done everywhere.
---
As of now, nerfing capitals to be unable to apply on subs just means that you can delete capitals, as they serve no other purpose than moving suitcases and titan bridges.
---
People need to understand that balancing against something is never the solution.
---
They are playing so clearly they are interested...
---
How are you having such a hard time grasping this idea? It's for 3v3 fights, CONTROLLED pvp. Instanced pvp and open world pvp can exist like it has in many other MMO's. What do you want him to do, go around null/low asking in local "who wants to 3v3 frigs!" and hope more people dont come? This is not going to make open world pvp disappear. It can also get pve players to try this 3v3 and possibly get them to explore low/null.
---
Nah it would be the ‚Äúwho is doing fishy things consistently‚Äù one that‚Äôs important
---
Then its extremely out of date. Before alphas and the big new palyer friendly nullsec groups there were a lot more hiseccers. Now there are very few actual hisec groups.
---
Strippers are clearly not politically correct enough, don't jinx it.
---
If you already had warp to 0 when you started eve you won't really understand what this fun graph meant.
---
Iirc it comes from when hurricanes and drakes were newly introduced, t1 fit bs were a thing or a necessity in some fleets (there didn't even exist "fleets", only 256 gangs).
---
Doctrines were something new in the game (which already had some years in his back). 
---
FC calling primaries t2 fit 200+km battleships (any race) was already too disruptive for the entire game and the pos spam abuse + DD spam of 1 (ONE) titan was enough to bring the entire coalition against the "elite alliance(s)"
---
But the real pain was the friggin instawarp bookmarks and warp to 15km (and to learn and make them all around)
---
They aren't, reddit is not representative of the EVE community.  The r/eve subreddit is full of a bunch of people who haven't played in a while, and a variety of other idiots as well.  A majority of EVE players don't post here, just remember that.
---
&gt; In any sandbox game you have to spend time and effort to kill other well built groups
---
But that's not what is happening, and that's not what the people we're talking about are trying to do. Small gangs and people who like flying a few blops battleships around and solo guys looking for low-hanging fruit aren't killing "other well built groups." They're killing individuals, or small numbers of players, who belong to larger groups, who usually are making mistakes that expose them more than normal.
---
CCP/PA are getting pretty desperate. Now instead of sending their promotions to my one commonly linked e-mail, they send them once for each account. (I quit in December)
---
https://i.imgur.com/T2Qloo4.png
---
When I was active, skill points were only handed out for the most severe server issues and could only be gained by staying conscientiously subscribed. Now they hand them out like candy just for logging in consistently, even to non-subscribers. It devalues the investment made by long time subscribers who have been hooked on EVE, so it's no surprise many would use it as a pretext to suddenly win EVE.
---
The middle path is best
---
1) It is far more stream and twitch friendly. Anyone who has taken a passing glance at the game industry knows that twitch viewership is a key driver of game population growth. You want EVE to grow and not die right?
---
2) Abyssal space was designed and implemented for players who could only play in short bursts of time hence the 20 minute time frame. People are not choosing between Abyssal and going on a roam, they are choosing between abyssal and not playing the game at all. You want people to actually play the game right? 
---
3) It adds a whole new way to play the game that appeals to a group of players that have been left in the dark with the elimination of support for the alliance tournament. You want the sandbox to be larger not smaller, right? 
---
4) All the assets are already programmed, we have proving grounds, we have 3v3 abyssal sites, from a dev perspective it should be a very easy function to implement. CCPs has said that Abyssal sites were an overwhelming success and are very popular with players. You would agree that a very popular feature that is very inexpensive to implement would be a benefit to any game from a business perspective? 
---
Anyone who actually cares about EVEs future and wants the game to do well can see this is a no brainier. Stop being selfish and dragging the game down just because people don't play in a way that fits your narrow opinions.
---
you dont want to know what hppened to the last person what copyed me
---
Point is, in programming you base on blockchain. Hilmar said he want to do it with no route map? 
---
How the fuck he want to make so complexed game to work with no route map? He is telling people he will change few things and check how it works? I could make game like eve and change some random code to see whats going on, not big deal right?
---
CCP HILMAR litteraly made poo on the middle of room to check how people react.
---
I like how you think subcap pve will make more per hour.  Go out there and try it... damn
---
Send me the pixels and I will double them for you.
---
holy shit dude get professional help.
---
u/Stainguy not caring for reddit karma...
---
Checks out.
---
I mean proving ground stopped spawning since a lot of time In us/aussie TZ, and finding someone In eu TZ Is still difficult.
---
Thank you! I thought I was taking crazy pills here with how these people can't understand such a simple concept that has such huge upsides.
---
....Good opinion.  Personally I disagree.
---
Intel is a part of eve's sandbox, always has been, and will be. 
---
"Hunters" are basically trolls in any other sandbox, they play no role other than picking off low hanging fruit... but for some reason everyone in eve thinks they should have more power.  That's never the case and will not be the case and SHOULD NOT be the case
---
What made WoW ‚Äòhard‚Äô at the beginning had more to do with the lack of experience most people had with games like it and the challenges of finding good info about strategy and game mechanics on the internet.  
---
‚ÄòNew and different‚Äô can be difficult mostly because everything has not been min/maxed by the people playing it.  No perfect specs, spell rotations, raid/instance strats and gear all sorted out in beta and almost available instantly.   People actually had to come up with answers themselves. 
---
Time, and 1000s of nerds ‚Äòfixed‚Äô that kind of problem with WoW over the course of time.  What they could not fix, Blizzard dumbed down, to make the game more understandable to the unwashed masses who did not want to actually lookup stuff on the internet to play.  
---
Eves ‚Äòsolution‚Äô to the problem of good information on the game, and actually how to play it, was left to our own nerds to sort out and make videos and websites to educate its players and CCP spent literally zero time educating and on-boarding players themselves.  
---
And....here you have it.  No new players and no infrastructure to actually teach new people and engage them in a game that is very different from just about any current game out there.
---
You're making assumptions that extend pretty far from your keyboard, dude.
---
amazing take haha
---
&gt;forged the biggest player group in the game
---
&gt;apparently knows nothing about pvp
---
i mean - so you're all being beaten by a group of uninformed people?
---
I've lived all around the map in low and Null. "stage in a better area" is not an answer. Sometimes its just not there.
---
It's up to players NOT CCP. Wanna dumpster low power structures? Shoot them. You guys want CCP to give you everything but never are willing to to the worküôÑ
---
Unfortunately, I am no longer working with the other two members, and we agreed to shutter the brand.

That said, I still do the EVE Universe Podcast, Talking in Stations, and High Drag Podcast.

&gt;you can't take my rorq from me.
---
It would be pretty cool to dinker with the mechanics such that the players, not NPCs/CCP, can more easily clean their own litter box.
---
Games dwindle as years go by, not to mention not reduction lowering the population. The game is in a reasonably natural down curve currently. For it‚Äôs age, the numbers are still impressive.
---
Okay but have you ever been in an open source licensing argument? I‚Äôve legit lost friend groups over that.
---
At the time I did not have a corp, so I was doing noob things in hard mode.
---
At some point I was convinced by eve-scout to try exploring - I made some isk doing that, but too often became a flying pinata for other people, so I didn't like that much.
---
On the other hand on one of my trips I noticed there was *ore* sites in the wormhole. Hey, wait a minute, I've got a venture and I can fit a probe launcher to it, lets try ore mining!
---
The sleeper in the site decided to point me from 100km away and started tearing my ship apart. While still trying to figure out what to do about that, a pilot blew me up and podded me.
---
I decided wormholes were not for me after that.
---
Stay tuned.

Eve universe you say.... Must Google this ASAP

"You can't just have a successful event, that's not the way the real world works"

MOSCOW2020 BOYS
---
EVE PvE? Sure. 
---
But the point of EVE's complexity is the player versus player aspect. You can't solve for the unpredicable, mistake-prone, devious, imperfect human in the same way as the predictable, guaranteed NPC response.
---
That's what traps people in this game for 10 goddamn years. Because while some fights may look similar, they are never the same.

Honestly, for a casual player, I‚Äôve been able to get a steady footing following these so events. I‚Äôve got my first ratting Barghest (It‚Äôs pretty!) and have a good income. I‚Äôm enjoying the game whilst not worrying about huge skill ques. Have you considered implementing a daily mission agent that gives 5000 so or something as to not encroach on your injector income?
---
A small group of defending caps should have an advantage.
---
Defending meaning prepared and on grid.
---
moderate Advantages that come from actual effort and coordination are good.
---
insurmountable advantages that come from basically doing the bare minimum are not.
---
**Astounding** Yet another stupid bee post that is actually making sense and speaking reason
---
As a shit post and salt farming hell yes
---
I mean, the same can be said in the early open world PvP or 40 man battlegrounds like Arathi Basin when it came out. WoW just didn't have perma-loss like EVE does. Instead it had a gold sink with broken gear. There was still lots of mechanics that you had to understand in your class. I remember being a lvl 35 rogue and ganking 40-somethings on their way to Booty Bay through STV, because I knew how to play rogue real well.
---
Make it 50 plex a month or 10 plex every rearrangement session for alpha accounts. Dont make it free for them
---
This gonna be good, please explain how it's faked? This isn't even max range.  You gotta use logic and math to prove me wrong.
---
Could I get an updated invite to the Discord, please? Started today and I've accomplished little except leaving the tutorial area, finding a billboard, and orbiting it.
---
What sec status is for btw ? (Game mechanics)
---
Thanks mate... I've only listened high drag up to Ep 52 so far (so good).
---
Will add this one to my list.
---
I don't think anyone, least of all CCP, is *ignoring* online numbers. My concern is that your analysis appears to stop once you've seen the online numbers change.
---
You suggest some alternative changes that you think wouldn't have had the same affect on the online numbers, but I admit I'm skeptical. If the problem CCP aimed to address was that casual semi-afk nullsec PVE was overpowered (my hypothesis, roughly), then any effective nerf to that playstyle was basically guaranteed to shed the players who can't adapt.
---
Whatever it‚Äôs context now, I don‚Äôt think I would have played EVE for the past 10 years if this graph didn‚Äôt exist.
---
Wait what, your 40m per hour metric was with a capital ship? LOL
---
Chaos only works if it's applied evenly.
---
I hope your roof get tornado - Hambone
---
It's almost like you didn't read my post or look at the graphs.
---
They won't allow alphas to use it because that's one of the hooks they use to get them to login daily to keep their PCU up.
---
As someone who came back after 4 year break and had to relearn everything - I am not entirely sure this applies. Eve is more time gated than skill gated. You'll learn mechanics probably at the same speed as any other MMO, only difference is in EVE - you have to wait between learnings. The fact that I need to wait 10 days in order to try out a single ship with full fitting - has really kind of put me off.
---
Sound like r/eve‚Äôs opinion of EVE ü§î
---
Let the Turbo Krabs rat, buy 10/10 DEDs, make billions a Day with cheap shit fit Subs
---
Pirates of the Burning Sea.
---
I'm of the same view about EVE.
---
bud, like adapting is one thing - being pushed to something you found unappealing in eve for years ... is something different.
---
Welp I'm not going to fly to the West Coast for a long weekend, and there's literally nothing I want to see in or around San Diego so I cant even sell it as a vacation.
---
gg was fun
---
the roof
---
Oh? So they are playing it because they have no interest in playing it? You're friends are weird dude...
---
I was aware of this yes, but I figured I‚Äôd just about break even in between t1 frig and t2 cruiser. It seems what dave said is true, I‚Äôm only landing red loots (databases, condensate, etc). That loot tripling is much more pronounced then what I anticipated. What could I expect from cruiser T3 then?
---
i must say that also the main site (eve travel) is great to have something else to do than just pvp, sightseeing in eve is one of those incredible things the developers left for us to enjoy.
---
are these the signs of the apocalypse? and its 4 capitals? 
---
*nope, wait i still cant post good*
---
The graph makes zero sense. It states Gaming Skill increasing as a function of time, then proceeds to plot a massively large Gaming Skill increase for Eve much sooner than any other MMO. 
---
The graph states you can get gud at Eve with less time invested compared to other MMOs. Whoever made this 12 years ago needs to go back to math class and learn how to plot a graph.
---
I dunno as someone who delved into both pvp and industry communities, the vast majority of pvpers are fucking retarded outside of the pvp elements and many just cant grasp how mechanics outside that work.
---
You paraphrased that grossly wrong.
---
And then you gave credit for the biggest and most powerfull coalition in the game to unwashed masses of F1 pushers and tax payers that just did as told by the leadership instead of giving it to this smallish group that took the meaningfull tactical and strategic decisions that got goons there.
---
You seriously don't see the flaws in your logic?
---
it was a que to buy gametime for any idiots that didnt buy it before launch.
---
I fail to comprehend how you dont have fun yet continuously repeat the same actions over and over
---
And then complain about not having fun
---
CCP has left so much money on the table for failing to follow through on basic ideas like that. I'm glad they fail at it though because otherwise they'd just have more money to pour into other projects that aren't EVE. The best hope I have for the genre is that another space MMO will come out that rips off 90% of EVE with developers who are more responsive and with a better cosmetic shop.
---
wow back before cata was fun, the game is not a casualized trash fest. just like eve is turning into to. Though eves chief problem is the lack of developers that actually play the fucking game rather than them particularly catering to the slobbering retards like wows was.
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Player-owned_starbases

dude's got a long post history and fought against the droneland slumlords (before skillu took everything) as part of Etherium Breach coalition though...
---
What's lowsec?
---
The week long quote is a dumb draw-away from the real problem, which is timezone tanking unfueled and smaller structures to the ass end of someones TZ so that killing them is a painful task. If I just need to stick a leshak on a raitaru during when I normally play, it's no big deal and a free 80m in salvage.
---
There is a damage meter that will read your combat logs in real time and provide you with a graph of incoming DPS. I've seen Hateless Gaming use it on twitch, but for the life of me I cannot recall the name of the app.
---
1) Streability shouldn't ever be a dev priority as less than 1% of eve wants to stream
---
2) If I cant interact with them after they undock to do some instance it's no different than if they didn't undock at all
---
3) How many alliance tournament teams have you been on? Because I have been and know plenty who think this idea is trash.
---
4) Ok?
---
I do care about the game, I dont want them to turn it into theme park style pubbie land and more instanced things help create the idea that it should cater to that play style aka "the casual" and while they do serve a purpose in the health of the game they dont do anything the does any world building and therefore should be the driving metric, that will just kill the game.
---
This is so untrue. We hired them in 2006 or 2007 against Tau Ceti for the battle of I-N in Immensea
---
What about the EVE widows and widowers out there??   At least in Vegas, they have things to entertain themselves while we were off doing nerd level 100.  San Diego, in October...kind of sucks tbh.   
---
Honey, enjoy the ice cold beach!!
---
Honey, enjoy your tour of the USS Midway.
---
Honey, enjoy your stroll through the homeless boroughs of down town SD!!
---
...I can't sell that.   I can, however, sell a weekend get away to Vegas...even with that sweaty nerd dance party on Saturday.   It's like CCP is in complete and utter denial their player base is growing up.
---
What are you being pushed to?
---
(Serious question. As I understand it you're being pushed away from an activity that CCP decided was overpowered in its current state.)
---
Alpha clone here and I skillcapped my current mission runner at 5mil, this acc has lots of wasted SP on cruise missile and Battleship/Battlecruiser skills. Another clone is in the works with all SP dedicated towards optimizing for the Gila. So I think for the current clone lv4 is out of the question though do you think I could run it on the new projected clone? Currently putting out 515DPS, 56k ehp, 74hp/s passive shield on a 400mil gila. No tech 2 launchers or drones only meta launchers and caldari navy drones. Thanks in advance!
---
Because those bombs have travel time and frigs move fast?

You assume there is no casual community. As in, people who don't flame this subreddit everyday.
---
40 man Arathi Basin what
---
I joined because I wanted an MMO that offered more than raiding and questing. One that offered numerous choices for progression and bountiful player interactions. One that didn't require a schedule of raiding every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
---
Only one that came up was EVE -- so I'm here for better or for worse. That's totally unique to MMOs in my experience, to have those kinds of options.
---
15m? You're buying some expensive shit for your t1 frigs bud...
---
That's some nice hopeful talk. Get back to me when you try it out. I'll do you the favor of not offering to correct you from a point of experience.
---
I don‚Äôt know man roll Orc Hunter it‚Äôs pretty ez mode \o/
---
No. If they want nice things, they should have to pay.
---
The focus of many people is just flat out wrong when it comes to the krabs vs the whalers. They want to prevent anything coming in and gank the roq. What eve needs is for the whalers to tackle the roq to bait and fight the umbrella when it comes in. Thats where the PVP is and should be. Not every response fleet in null is goons dropping in 1 billion supers. It was possible to do this before the blackout. Ships bounced, caps warped off to citadels and got caught in bubbles, hell theres usually a bunch of kitchen sink subcaps floating around in these fights. You could chew on them and blam fighters if you dont have the deeps to kill a dread in siege or a fax. 
---
Its incredibly hard so should i say..... dangerous to hang around after the drop and steal kills from under the umbrellas nose.
---
Everyone in a nullbloc thinks these changes are purposefully made to make your life more difficult. Well imo nullsec has it easy compared to highsec players right now.
---
Drifters stopped spawning in null but now triglavs randomly spawn in non-invasion highsec systems murdering every miner, noob, afked player, bot, and anyone unfortunate enough to get caught at a celestial in HIGHSEC. Nullsec obviously is risky but highsec is the "safe" space that now also has this same shit going on. I have no idea why CCP thinks highsec needs to be more dangerous.
---
tldr: nullseccers aren't the only people fucked over by these recent changes.
---
Sorry you're retarded. vOv
---
Do I? :S Are you sure this isn't about your "friends" and not your friends? O.o
---
look if someone has an opposing view it is my right to call them a sockpuppet or a bot, this is how reddit works, so just downvote me and move on thank you
---
where did i say i wasn't having fun?
---
I am hit by all CCP recent changes - except for removal of excavators as i am not a miner.
---
The reason it took this long for remote skill manipulation was because they wanted to maintain the illusion of active players logging in all the time. Even if they only logged in long enough to reset the queue and then leave.
---
Now you can do it by phone, assuming you're paying for the game each month. Even if you're PLEX'ing, someone somewhere paid cash for that PLEX.
---
Alphas are freeloaders. They need to put down their cardboard signs and their tin cups and get off the street corner. Stop being filthy beggars, and pay for the game you play.
---
He thinks that because someone mentioned Malcanis Law a few years back now everyone just sock puppets that to everything.
---
I liked them too. It was a surprising buff to JF logistics but now we get some stupid watered down solution that doesn't really change anything in regards to JFs.
---
But you still need to find 19 other nerds, or pay for 19 other Omega accounts to pre 20 F1 buttons.
---
That would be fair, for the sake of testing. 
---
It‚Äôs a valid reason beyond the bullshit hype others proclaimfor self importance (seriously how massive of an egomaniac do you need to be to think you are bringing ‚Äúbalance‚Äù with your playstyle)
---
are you doing it every time?
---
if that small group of people could've accomplished it on their own - why did they recruit the "unwashed masses"?
---
oh right - because they couldn't, and therefore everyone who participated is worthy of credit.
---
The idea of resource scarcity, at least as i imagine it, is not about depletion but about spreading resources around with a lower isk cap per system to prevent infinite blobbing and stacking alts to get another boring 40m/h. Old belt farming sounds great here (spawn limits, not isk/h part though it was ok back then).
---
Living 40 jumps away from sov capital won't really make your daily farm any harder but it will make you to actually build and somewhat defend your home on your own instead of everything being handed to you on a plate.
---
Instant power projection is another problem here, but it looks like CCP are working on it and if evicting ten 50-man corps across sov border will actually mean some work for the big guys, we will hopefully see some independent groups claiming their own space and fighting neighbors instead of joining the doughnut.
---
As of "why" - being part of big ally is pretty much the only way of holding null sov and it is boring as fuck because you can't and even worst - don't have to do anything on your own (you already have all the keepstars and 10bil supers and whatnot) individual players (as well as corps and even alliances inside coalitions) have very say in what they're actually doing and if you decide to  "build your own empire" you're fighting such an uphill battle it's pointless. So you go to c2-c5-null or jita and pvp for the sake of pvp and it's fun, but eve can be so much more than that.
---
Null wasn't always the way it is and the reason it became a boring swamp is not some otherworldly genius of modern krabs or their leaders, but game mechanics that made infinite n+1 possible to the point of absurd.
---
Badge of honor.
---
If the reasoning is ‚Äúbecause JUSTICE‚Äù it‚Äôs like One punch man vs garou when garou  just keeps repeating ‚ÄúI WANT EVIL BECAUSE IM EVIL AND THERE WILL BE EVIL‚Äù
---
Then it‚Äôs a fallacy, and people don‚Äôt like that because they want to feel like the super important heroes saving the game by killing krabs , it‚Äôs silly isn‚Äôt it?
---
Says the hunter wanting even less work for their playstyle.
---
Thanks very much! reporting a successful build on Ubuntu 19. Happily up and running.
---
126km point can get you a lot of boyfriends
---
If you think a one liner post on reddit is a catch all for every possible fleet engagement here, your experience is pretty limited.
---
But thanks for the contribution üëä
---
thats not true, people would anchor more athanors, and only fuel them when the moons were good.
---
yeah you have to try all sorts of strategy to bait them out
---
i'm not a hunter - there's no value in it.
---
Actually highsec is getting hit pretty hard right now with the Raznaborg Triglavs fucking up anyone trying to rat or do industry. They also warp to other celestials so PI has become unexpectedly dangerous in highsec as well.

this has to be a troll right? No one is this thick. 
---
1)"less than 1% wants to stream", news flash streaming is not for the streamers, its for the viewers and each one is a potential new player. 
---
2) of course you can interact with them, go in the freaking site with your friends 
---
3) I organize tournaments for my alliance, newbros and bittervets who have done real ATs both have a blast in them and they think this idea is great. 
---
4) your personal biases are holding you back. YOU dont like this idea so you dont think ANYONE should like this idea. Get your head out of the sand already before your bitterness eats any joy you have left in this game. What will kill this game is people with your mindset dragging it into the ground.
---
so, exactly nothing would change except fuel bills would go down?
---
I miss the old scanning system. That skillwall was huge and I felt like a fucking superhero scanning for bigtimers. I could find motherfuckers so fast in anomalies combining probes and angular directional scanner...
---
Then they just noobified the whole thing
---
sickest burn 2019
---
This thread is proof that Eve players can bitch about anything.
---
I can see self reflection gets deflected by you immediately. Now you're assuming, yet again, far beyond the call of duty. Are you so scared of being wrong you have to create a different truth to hide behind?
---
This is such a good solution that I wish I could upvote it multiple times.
---
&gt; and therefore everyone who participated is worthy of credit.
---
is that what you tell the minimum wage slave after he delivered your 2$ package irl?
---
This is either an extremely advanced shitpost or some blupilled Chinese mining bot leaning to complain in local
---
@all the doom &amp; gloom:
---
People complain because they care, however, they won't admit it. 
---
Btw I love Eve. I come back to Eve again and again because how challenging solo pvp is (I come back because I take breaks due to a lot of IRL responsibilities).
---
And I love that CCP is addressing some tough issues resulting in e.g. the recent blackout.
---
Even with that boosher, if you're in range for your bombs to land they're most likely getting scrammed...
---
You are beyond retarded dude.
---
This is the picture that got me interested in EVE back in the day. Haven't played EVE for ages since I started talking to women but this brings me back.
---
no, it really isn't dumb.
---
it's not a good idea to give everyone a mobile app that lets them effortlessly set up pretty much as many skill farms as they want. restricting it to omega is a very prudent idea.
---
indeed.
---
it's almost like if you want all the features of the game, you should upgrade from a trial account.
---
Too true. There have been times those big, epic fights were all but guaranteed that I didn't bother logging in because I simply didn't feel like engaging in an 8 hour slog in tidi to get on like 40 kills.
---
no.
---
&gt; "My" guys?
---
I could be wrong. I thought the last time I saw you all it was a fleet led by some BLOPS BS. My memory sucks, so if I am mistaken, apologies.
---
No, fuck off
---
No u!
---
eve is saturated with everything, and in wars titan blots are all that matter. And you can't compete with goons in numbers.
---
not unless they roll back the client/server to '06 or so
---
you're the one pretending a one man band and his dog are apparently all you need to be an empire - funny how there aren't actually any of those around...
---
Maybe they should, but that's not really what this dude is whining about.
---
no, that's what i tell people who participate in things to achieve a common goal
---
because i'm not an asshole like you apparently are if you think people aren't worthy of credit when they go out of their way to assist others in achieving something.
---
with 2012 or earlier game mechanics: yes, at once.
---
with todays game mechanics: no, hell no
---
How would you avoid the situation of having people who live in high sec all of a sudden become targets because someone put a bounty on them and they have no idea. Suddenly someone can just come out of no where. Kill them in high sec, and not even get a Concord response. Or will you limit it to only low and null sec?
---
And if that's the case where would the bounty agent offices be? Low sec? NPC Null sec? But since bounties in the system you describe are based on distance that means there would literally be no point of putting bounties on anyone that lives in deep null sec because there'd be little to no chance they would ever be selected as targets for hunters due to there probably being someone closer most of the time.
---
It would also mean that low sec pirates would have a billion times more chances of being targets at all times since they would almost always be closer to bounty agent then anyone else.
---
Not what I said at all, learn to read.
---
sorry AV, not AB. And maybe in disorganized groups, but some guilds put a lot of effort into BG/Open World PVP.
---
depends, t2 guns are like a bit more than a mill each, so that's the first 5 mill, 5 mill for tank, 5 mill for Rigs and mids / lows depending on your tank type, for a t2 fit that's pretty reasonable (Even though I admit the tackle mods not needed in a fleet comp make a pretty big price difference so maybe you get along with 10-12 mill, still makes four ships per bomber only)
---
Maybe that's it..
---
I super don't get the argument. theoretically some small guys would not be affected at all, as they wouldn't bump against the soft cap.
---
It doesn't help that the cost to move shop is so high due to the costs of structure rigs, and that's even before we take into account the effort to move everything else. 
---
You want conflict drivers in eve? Make the universe come alive. Make it do things to the players. There's more than just 30k some capsuleers in this game, there's thousands of npcs. 
---
Are the big 4 factions unable to mount an effort against null? What about strategic pushes into null or low by other factions? What about standings that matter? What kinda sandbox is this even?
---
Just wiping/restartimg doesnt fix the current eve problems.
---
Im mainly playing because of what i achieved. And because the friends ive found. Yes, eve is a great game but it isnt great enough for me to restart and just be im the same shit we are currently in in no time with even less players...
---
PANIC made sense but it just reinforces the 'tank' of the Rorqual. If the Rorq was a regular boosting ship with normal drones only, the effective mining comes from the barges which don't have that tank advantage. It becomes a much harder thing to save even with the umbrella. Plus they are harder to effectively multibox compared to Rorqs.
---
Calm down, I have been reading the history of Eve book and was kind of inspired by the whole space race campaign that went on the first few years. I can get never wanting to feel held back by lack of resources and skills though
---
Classic CCP
---
yeah, that¬¥s not at all what i meant but why am i even trying with you?
---
you're the one pretending the majority of the players in the group apparently are irrelevant.
---
it's very evident what point you're failing to try and push.
---
If they aren't interested then why are they still playing?
---
If it was a requirement of a shift in mechanics that would get rid of issues regarding entrenched super powers, definitely. This could be like an EVE 2, hopefully with some core gameplay changes, as well as mechanics. One issue I know that balances, especially regarding resources, that adjustments bump up against is the fact that some kinds of mechanics that restrict growth can simply lock the big guys into their positions that the small guys can never overcome. So a reset would almost be required to make those mechanics promote a healthy ecosystem.
---
If not, maybe, maybe not.
---
What about 2020s game mechanics?
---
then perhaps you should try again and make an actual point instead of trying to spew irrelevant insults?
---
They'll be back... They always come back
---
I get that, I have been reading the empires of Eve book and feel like the only way to get back some of the "Space race" style player driven stories would be to start over. Not saying it's a good idea by any means though, and many people will join the chorus of fuck offs, but hey. Just a harmless questions
---
This is new levels of thin-skinned.
---
the race has already been won - wiping the game won't change the winner.
---
Not a chance
---
Hilmar doesn't have some gimmicky money-hole project to focus on anymore. We got his [full attention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKvX04_6DKY) now bois.
---
That makes sense and I thought about that after I posted. Today might be a little too pay to win if we restarted.
---
No, no, you had a bad idea and got called on it. Don't go playing the victim card.
---
This has been built into game design from the beginning. You have to make it exponentially harder to control territory further away from your core while also making it necessary to expand to keep from starving your self out. Yes, are 40k people always going to have an advantage against 2k? Sure. But change the scale of that advantage from 20:1 to 2:1 and suddenly having 40k people is a liability, not a benefit.
---
Okay. First off I didnt read the whole pist so I'm just gonna comment on the first bit. You see a lot of complaints. Get off reddit. It's nothing but bittervets who hate the game and hate themselves. Most of them dont even play anymore. Fuck all these retards and their opinions.
---
The dev's have commented on some of these issues for many years.
---
Player strength used to be determined by looking at the age of the character. That went away when Skill injectors got released.
---
As far as single PVP you have to memorize all the ships in your class, know what counters you, see the model of their guns to determine if they are short or long range, do you orbit or fly at an angle, while managing overheat and manually piloting. Implants? It's complicated.
---
"Spreadsheets in Space" the game is written more or less in Stackless Python 2.7 Eve came out in 2003, it's basically patched onto ever since. I believe it was a design decision to be able to make changes quickly/easily.
---
Getting killed in hisec and not understanding why has been an issue in the game for a very very long time.  Last I heard the dev's would like to change it, but they won't because it would alienate a portion of their player base. The players are very passionate when changes are made so CCP has to weigh the risk and prepare to hear the backlash. CONCORD is there to punish not to protect confuses new players as well.
---
My first loss was a multibillion Navy Raven that took me \~60 hours running L4 missions, destroyed within a minute. After months I didn't know when your war decced in hisec they use out of corp alts to hunt you down. CCP refer to it as "edge plays" My second billions loss was a Charon being bumped off the in-gate and held for 15 minutes then blown up.  The response by other players was "You should have known about CODE". It was my 2nd day back after not playing for a few years when they didn't even exist. The game punishes you for ignorance.
---
As far as aimlessness, Eve has always been a sandbox. I'm sure it was a design decision in the beginning partly I assume because its cheaper that way. CCP provides the tools to build your castles. They did add career agents as a new player tutorial to get you started but I do feel a few things can get too complex and then I lose motivation in doing them. Like T2 ship manufactoring. I used to probe anomolies before they built probehelper into the game. PI'ed across 8 accounts before the iteron changes which was super tedious btw having to login and haul it daily.
---
Life After Death...the point is to control space which includes kicking other people out of it. This also relates to your WH statement about not joining and being shot and then traveling all over again, the answer is yes. Welcome to Eve.
---
Gate guns, again not there to protect, only to punish. I see other people in this thread are confused about that as well.
---
Certainly not
---
::autism emoji::
---
If you don't label your axes with objective data then you really shouldn't expect anyone to take you seriously.
---
Nostalgia is what keeps me coming back to Eve, but I keep coming back to less friends and less fun. But I too would hate to give up my millions of SP and be stuck sub caps for a good long while
---
Aren't plans just a list of things that don't happen?
---
This is a terrible decision by CCP, and reflects a lack of knowledge about North America.  Vegas is the most accessible (and cheapest) travel destination in North America.
---
Moving to SD will create significantly higher costs for most people who travel to it, between airfare and hotels.
---
San Diego (or any other location) will never have the success of Vegas, for those reasons.
---
yikes
---
I really appreciate the dog that was killed for leather used on my nikes he is really a valued member of the nike team
---
I would not, I only came back to eve after 10 years because I did not have to start over.
---
&gt;everyone who participated is worthy of credit
---
That's pretty far from reality. A random app champ pingwarrior who shows up for fights, anchors, and presses F1 a dozen times is not anywhere near as responsible for the victory of a large coalition as the FCs, leadership, and logistics personnel who plan, coordinate, and execute strategies.
---
https://media1.giphy.com/media/QWaSVX9FizaxO/source.gif
---
No moron, I'm saying that the credit for knowledge and intelligence behind the success can be only given to those that actually *decided* things, not to the ones following orders.
---
And that was in response to you argument against calling a random goon linemember disinformed about his opinion (the original comment wasn't even about PVP as you argued).
---
But hey, good attempt at turning around a topic to look like you are right! Maybe next time kiddo.
---
EVE doesn't release expansions that invalidate everything you did previously like other MMOs, a big part of the attraction for classic or progression servers is running content you either didn't do when it was current or enjoyed when it was current and want to do again. They also aren't single server. So no, I wouldn't, there's nothing in it for me and even less for those who would have to rebuild entire empires.
---
Absolutely if ccp addressed some of the current broken parts of Eve (injectors, excavators,etc). And before anyone says it, yes, I‚Äôm a very old toon with lots of assets.
---
Use rorqual bursts and broadcast your 10+ covetors/hulks onto asteroids.
---
Use 30 line script to move ore into ore bay whenever needed.
---
Compress ore and sell to that guy who can be arsed building nyx, apostle or avatar hulls with his 10 accounts.
---
Very complex industry.
---
noooo. well i dont care about assets but starting skilling from zero is a killer. i started a alpha and all those horrible memories came up from when i was a Eve Infant
---
Nope, It would just solidify many of us wanting to walk away.
---
A lot are only still here due to what we have / Sunk cost fallacy, If those disappear, Then so do many players
---
This should be fixed in September or October patch. There‚Äôs a bug stopping it from spawning as often as it could
---
i didn't say they were.
---
i just said they are worthy of credit - which they are. for voluntarily giving up their time to help a group reach a shared goal.
---
not a single time did i say they deserve as much credit, or were as important as any other person you want to list.
---
people who give up any amount of time, of their own free will, to help a group achieve a shared goal deserve credit - i don't even know how that's a debateable statement.
---
Sure. But that's not Vegas.
---
And I'm doubtful it'll have the draw that Eve Vegas had either, Its not got the pull that Vegas has.
---
I mean, coming out of Beta there were corporations that we ahead in terms of organization and members that started out ahead but eventually fell to other powers popping up. Do you truly believe no new powers might try to enter the race and or are the powers that be now just so large they would jump right back to the top and leave others even further behind than they might feel now? I can easily see a rich get richer scenario more than fresh start fresh leadera
---
Never played WOW so I don't know what most of those words mean, but the scale of EVE's pvp arena and the loss mechanics in it are far beyond what I've heard about in basically any other game.
---
&gt;I'm saying that the credit for knowledge and intelligence behind the success can be only given to those that actually decided things, not to the ones following orders.
---
ideas ain't worth shit until they're carried out.
---
I didn't even get past the thought of starting an alpha haha. Starting over knowing I would be wayyyy further behind was just an impossible thought.
---
You should stop listening to the vocal minority and just play the game.
---
yes, now imagine how far ahead corps will be after having 15 years of experience with the actual game rather than a buggy beta?
---
that gap is going to be even wider and there's even less chance a new group would be able to do a goddamn thing against that level of accumulated knowledge and organisation.
---
Hahahaha. The struggle is real
---
It *is* a PvP game, though. Literally every single mechanic exists in service to PvP. If you want a game where you can just farm without interruption, WoW is thataway.
---
I have an idea. Let's get rid of them altogether. 
---
Chaos baby, Chaos!
---
What about a new wormhole that is discovered (similar to eve gate) that you can take in your venture. No implants, no isk, only your skills and a mobile shipyard (similar to a depot) for construction of ships etc. 
---
This takes you to a new cluster of space that has to be colonised. You can go back and forth in said venture, but only with blueprints in your cargo.
---
Etc etc...
---
Im not going to write my entire idea down, incase im wasting my time typing (downvotes etc)
---
You aren't worthy of praise just because you showed up. EVE players are so entitled nowadays.
---
&gt;Astounding Yet another stupid bee post that is actually making sense and speaking reason
---
Good going /u/NalanaVos . You now have the support of the biggest crybaby in all of /r/eve. You must be on the right track.
---
you're right, we should never thank people or give them credit for helping when they support you in achieving something. ever, fuck them. right?
---
As a former head of an industrial alliance that owned space in various places and various forms i can say this is 100% correct.  Any pvper i got would get bored because no one else wanted to pvp.  They don;t care.  As long as they can do there activity and make isk, it doens;t bug them.  You come take there space? they will pack ther ecrap, move back to empire and go start over again.  They simple don;t want to pvp.
---
Eve's issue has zero to do with CCP.  The null sec blocks do not want to fight.  Reducing resources will not cause them to fight, they will just cycle things differently and come into a new plan. it will only annoy them.
---
It can be much better than turbobling cruiser 1vs1 which is garbage (especially after we got ikitursa)
---
But it has serious cons as other guys mentioned so it will be good for temporary event mode like 3 day in every month
---
When their help is meaningful, sure. When they, individually, could have not showed up and had no meaningful effect on the outcome either way, no.
---
That razu can probably scram to within 50k
---
Cool story bro, don't let the door hit you on the way out. :p
---
I started a new character in 2019 after I made 2010 the last one. I liked a fresh new start in the morning.
---
lmao chill b
---
IDK man, San Diego isn't some no name town. Sure it won't have the same attractions but I wouldn't say that the attractions SD has are particularly worse than LV
---
so when a ping goes out and nobody shows up - what exactly will get done?
---
You can't kill anything with the cloak up so there's no reward either, sounds balanced to me.
---
That‚Äôs a value add my dude
---
:picard_facepalm:
---
I'd rather they get a hacking mechanic that allows an attacker to start the unanchor timer after the Strux is left offline for a few months.
---
There's a difference between thanking a group of people for their effort and thanking each individual person for their negligible contribution to the whole.
---
I see you have never met the infamous autoshot afk follow hunter
---
Depends on which release but anything pre-2012, Hell yes, I would!
---
This entire comment thread?
---
No, fuck that.
---
Spreadsheets.
---
Go t2, they are not that expensive
---
Youre not even in this fucking discussion, are you high?
---
&gt; our venture. No implants, no isk, only your skills and a mobile shipyard (similar to a depot) for construction of ships etc.
---
Hell no. I wouldn't mind if they allowed a one way transfer in a rookie ship and a few (2-5M) SP free but what you describe is having your cake and eating it, too.
---
This is another situation that I simply don't get. "Oh no no, the anoms would move from System A to System B and then people will have to move to System B." K. I mean ignoring the fact that people in System B are already ratting and sending their "extras" to System C and so on, this really won't have a great affect. Why having ratters in System B instead of System A makes it harder to defend I don't know. If you think you'll catch people moving between systems, they'll either have multiple ships stashed around ratting areas (like I do) or in the case of cap ships, just jump them around (like I do). 
---
I'm trying to figure out the scenario here. I'm going to rat today so I log in to the system I tend to rat in and.. what? Is the system already depleted because EU guys ran the timers up? How long until it goes back to "normal"?
---
But more importantly, this demands sov alliances hold the entire region because you don't want to do your ratting and let some other alliance get the anoms. This is another change that essentially eliminates smaller alliances from 0.0 because they won't be able to benefit from the changes people are proposing. 
---
You call my view myopic but most of these changes are very short sighted and won't have the intended affect which seems to be "break apart current null blocs because grrr". There seems to be this line of thinking of "We'll make 0.0 more complicated and *waves hands* they'll all be gone and 0.0 will be how I want it" when most of these changes will simply solidify larger blocs who can handle this kind of organization.
---
What do you think the large guy does when his resources are depleted.
---
What did hirohito do when the resources of Japan could support his war machine
---
What did Hitler do when his resources just weren't enough to satisfy his thirst for more military power and domination
---
What did great Britain do through its history to maintain its military strength for hegemony over the world 
---
I wonder what the big guy (aKa Goons, you know, the one nobody can contest anymore)  will do when their resources are depleted. Maybe they'll roll into the next region that has maybe 2000-3000 active players and bring the content to them? I wonder who will undock to go toe to toe with them, ever? Sounds pretty fantastic to me.
---
Umm do you actually play this game dude...
---
New player retention has been an issue for ages, I highly doubt the app will help to correct this. The point is this the game needs active people in space not on a app.
---
No.  Another instance or an Eve classic is a bad idea and I wouldnt want to go backwards.
---
I tweaked BL's legion doctrine and imported about 40bil of ships to hand out for a doctrine comprised of 5 different fits. With that doctrine I've been hunting provi whales and gotten a few interesting fights.  
---
Rhetorical statements function best when you actually know the nature of the information solicited.
---
Fuck that. I have no desire to spend years skilling up all this shit again. Also if they ever did a restart with injectors you'd have titans dropping on frigates as soon as the first titans would be produced - which would be way quicker than you seem to believe.
---
no there isn't.
---
thanking each individual person for their effort is exactly what you do when you thank a group...
---
Eve Classic TM
---
Anything works for small gang FCing in lowsec, just pick a frigate, get a decent fit, a couple logis and that's about it.
---
Knowing your area, your targets and the locals will be far more important that what unificated kitchen sink fleet doctrine you choose.
---
Wouldent even go down, its mostly just annannoyance of having to do diffrent citaldels every 3 months.
---
Vegas to San Diego? Lol.. How about the best party city in the USA, NOLA!
---
&gt;Then again, judging by your flair, your "PvP" probably consists of fleet ops where the alliance hands you a muninn, you anchor on FC #461 and try to press F1 fast enough to get on kill mails.
---
wow isnt it true that we actually have killboards where you can search up people? you should check them out sometime, maybe if you had more than two brain cells
---
vengeances/confessors and deacons
---
care to quote the bit where i stated that i wasn't having fun?
---
It'll be fine. You can kill gate rats if you get bored.
---
You‚Äôre still playing the game sitting in a belt. Matter of fact you‚Äôre creating content for 90% of the PvPers in EVE who for the most part are just trying to pad their killboards with easy kills. You‚Äôre welcome.
---
€ú\(◊°÷º‚Å†⁄∫◊°÷º‚Å†Ÿé` )/€ú CONDOR COUNTRY €ú\(◊°÷º‚Å†⁄∫◊°÷º‚Å†Ÿé` )/€ú
---
I'll let you in on a secret, we have seen this all before. Eve has been dying since 2012 It will be fine keep playing your game the ones that leave will be replaced the ones that complain and leave always return
---
That's not how things work, I'm afraid. You're just trying to argue your way out of the corner you've backed yourself into.
---
You know how you learn those mechanics? Go blow up 10 ships.
---
so what exactly do you think happens when you thank a group?
---
just so i know exactly how wrong you are.
---
because the entire point of thanking a group, is so that everyone in the group gets thanked... that's what happens.
---
Ehhh no (mobile version, yes)
---
&gt; Would you join try to relive the Great Wars?
---
Fresh instance does not imply that the history will be repeated too.
---
Yeah structured pair has it right.
---
There is no point, he is just going to echo his voice because he is a vet and automatically knows what's best for EvE.
---
confessors and deacons, or hecates &amp; kirins
---
they're cheap as crap too.
---
If you dont wanna do that, caracals
---
I know. I was once in a drone region renter corp to make ISK and got the position of fc. As long as the fleet didn't force them to come like cta or homedef they wouldn't care. I formed a fleet to fight a roaming gang the guys came into the ts channel asked if it was a homedef I told them it's not homedef but we fight against the gang that omes into the pocket and then half of the fleet left because they didn't get forced to join the fleet.
---
So when you want to get wars in eve you have to get the crabs to do it and the best thing to do it is mess with their income when they don't do it.
---
Now, to which of the aforementioned categories the downvoters belong too ?
---
where are you having these problems?
---
Grinding is absolutely fine because your progression is proportional to time put in. Grinding isn't exactly hard. Grinding was never my problem. You learn more as you put more time played in aswell but eve's progression doesn't care about how much time you put in, how much you know about the game, how much you've learnt... it only cares about how long you've waited which is why it's the progression is so bad. It's not "cold" or "hard" it's just plane bad and puts off new players. Actually in that regards I'd conclude that eve's progression of not even having to learn the game, grind and put time in makes me think eve online may actually be the easiest game of ALL and the players have been fooling themselves all this time trying to make themselves feel better because they can't play twitch based pvp games and prefer games where they get a solid advantage by doing absolutely fuck all then buying some plex to skip the isk grind. It's all soooo clear now.
---
Longbow corms, warp in at range and snipe stuff @80-110 km depending on how much SP your group has
---
2013 - "Like Eve, we believe Dust is going to be a long-term service that will  vastly outlive the hardware that it launches on, much like Eve has  vastly surpassed the graphics cards and processors of the PCs it  launched on in 2003," answered David Reid, chief marketing officer at  CCP.   
---
He was fired a year later.
---
I don't even...
---
Anything as long as you can afford it
---
I would and it'd be interesting but I don't see the point as the capital proliferation and other issues would just come back again at some point. It doesn't solve anything to do a big reset.
---
&gt; 2 months ago
---
lol
---
Yep. Not your real flair.
---
&gt; What did hirohito do when the resources of Japan could support his war machine What did Hitler do when his resources just weren't enough to satisfy his thirst for more military power and domination What did great Britain do through its history to maintain its military strength for hegemony over the world
---
They made content.
---
Also notice how all of those lost against a much much much younger entity, 2 of them at the same time.
---
If you are going to control 20 bombers properly, its going to take input broadcasting software.
---
Only if we take the Eve server of 2007
---
the faction mods have lower skill requirements and sometimes (usually I think) better bonuses. Dark blood modules are good and cheap because gewns.
---
Not a hope in hell. Ive sunk so much money into the game over the 14-15 years I've been playing that I  wouldn't even entertain the idea of starting fresh just to try it.
---
Did you scrap all your assets?
---
Good, next DT there will be at least a few Keepstars and dozens of fortizars vanish
---
How do you sign up for it?
---
Under current mechanics no.
---
Like I often make this joke if eve had today's mechanics when I started i wouldn't be playing today.
---
So what happens when the people who want risk free/easy PvE just leave? Is the idea to just let them leave/have Eve a smaller base or is the belief that these people are faking it and will accept the losses that come with higher risk?
---
&gt;Why?
---
Eons ago, there was a game called Ultima, which had a pretty hard playstyle. Ultima became a shitty theme park game and died. Some of the people that loved the hard aspect of Ultima created a new game. A space sandbox.
---
The game gained noteriety in the press for having a hard ass play, real risk (in terms of losing all that time you spent grinding for that ship), in game backstabbing, and the worlds biggest online douchebags. It was a glorious game that somehow grew in spite of all these things. There was always a small core of people who bemoaned the cut throat aspect of the game but rather than move on to a more suitable space sim, they stayed and lobbied.
---
Eventually, they had enough voice they were able to convince CCP to make the game softer, easier, nicer. They used words like player retention and how the game was losing people because it was hard (while ignoring the game was growing even as they made these complaints.
---
Eve became easier. It was small stuff at first. Things like exploration becoming Marco-Polo. Things like not needing to upgrade clones. Pretty much everyone rejoiced at the small changes. Then we got gifts like Anomalies and iHubs and NULL became a place where all the mission runners figured they could make their billions in safety... and they did.
---
CCP ignored the slope downward after all these little things they did to make the players happy but that didn't stop the ever growing crowd of people crying out for more. Soon we had SP gifts, Skill extractors, Rorq farms, day one titan pilots. It was glorious... for the krabs.
---
Finally, after five years and more of constant listening to the bears, CCP noticed they had been losing players since they began making Eve easier. The loss of revenue from subs was supplemented by the availability of SP injectors but that mechanic was abused to the point the game became tidally locked by the ridiculous mass of every character having a capital and every player having dozens of alts.
---
CCP awakened. They realized that it might already be too late but they were determined to save their game and began making it ever so slightly harder.
---
Now, the same players demanding more safety are up in arms. "I won't undock my krabbign ships!", "I am unsubbing 56 accounts, you fuckers!", "Hilmar is the devil and deserves to be a pauper!" are some of their ralying cries. They are dead set on killing the game from within, with all the sugar needed to finish off the diabetic game.
---
The thing is, maybe it IS too late. I hope not but it's possible enough players of Easy-mode eve will leave and not be replaced by old or new hard mode ones. I hope they save the game from its sugary killers but might be hoping in vain.
---
One thing is for sure. If the game does die and it is the Eve I remember, then I will celebrate it having lived a good life.
---
Downvote me, you entitled bitches. :)
---
You claim hilmar wants you to be stressed and taking anxiety meds
---
Vegas is the best EVE player event, so of course they're going to shit can it.
---
Nope
---
Yes
---
Ping for all caps.
---
As a total eve noob I agree with this.
---
That's exactly what he said on stream.
---
Then go have fun
---
I do have fun.
---
My experience show that faction expensive t2 not so expensive.
---
Because bitching about ending the most popular EVE event is just so completely outside the realm of possibility.  Literally nobody could see this coming.
---
I've lost like 5-10% of my previously almost risk free grinding. 
---
How many hours have you ratted or mined since the blackout and how many ships have you lost?
---
Assault Frigates are pretty forgiving doctrines for a new FC with a small gang. 
---
But if you're talking strictly T1 I'd suggest upshipping to Caracals. They're a classic doctrine for a reason.
---
Who is "we"? Are talking about LV?
---
No, it wouldn't fix the fundamental issues with the game and it would just end up the same as it is now fairly quick.
---
Jesus christ people.  Someone showing geniune approval of the game's fantastic imagery shouldn't be met with vitriol and ridicule.  If it's not your thing, STFU and move on.
---
You can't be serious...
---
As long as there's no injectors, no citadelss and no Plex yes. That's a purists dream
---
That's a No from me.
---
&gt;your name *and* real flair
---
Name is right though ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  
---
I think it was already established that our level is low enough to argue semantics here, and you're sitting in a glasshouse mr warped intentions member
---
Really? Because I started when injectors didn't exist and we didn't cry for an advantage from CCP
---
Yes we need nukes in game to drop on civilian centers, and we need a war machine matching the sheer overwhelming numbers the Soviets had been throwing at germany the whole while we built up a second overwhelmingly huge force on the other fronts to all push against goons comparatively tiny numbers at the same time
---
Oh wait, thats not the case in eve. They have the numbers to overwhelm the rest of eve combined lol
---
Well i never was planning so far to go there and didn't make it to Vegas this year, because of 4 other Events ... and was in fact planning for next year, because of fanfest and vegas, just now to find out, there won't be another one :(
---
Sunk cost my dude
---
it looks like combat probes need an expanded launcher...should I not run combat probes?
---
Link to the quote please
---
Sure!
---
Talking in stations. Go look it up yourself. I can't be arsed to try and link it from mobile. Was a few weeks ago. Should be easy to find.
---
Some of us predate alot of mechanics and changes to the game.  Others of us took a break from the game before those changes took place.
---
Maybe you will find a roll for sub caps if your issue here is bubbles. Recons can cloak. If you don‚Äôt want to be at 0 I guess you‚Äôll have to cloak and get yourself into position. Or! Interceptors could burn you pings to warp cyno‚Äôs on grid. Or! T3c‚Äôs nullified could get into position. If it‚Äôs specifically timers you are worried about why not get cyno‚Äôs in position in the week you have to prepare? 
---
Your bumping issue is going to happen whether you cyno on grid, off grid or next door - both sides will have to deal with it and so I‚Äôm not sure what the drama is here - the fact you have to align and warp? You could use multiple cyno‚Äôs if you are fielding a hundred caps ? Sounds reasonable. Yes dictors will slow you down but if a hundred caps can‚Äôt kill a few sabre alts you don‚Äôt deserve to get to the timer. I guess it will be difficult to have a hundred guys act as a unit but that‚Äôs the downside to null blocs. You will figure it out I‚Äôm sure
---
Oh, hello semi-serious question, it's been a few days since anyone asked. No, I would not like that. I would not like that at all.
---
&gt;I'll do you the favor of not offering to correct you from a point of experience.
---
just because you're bad doesnt mean everyone is buddy
---
I dont like injectors. Dilutes the game and people who have been skilling for years
---
I could live with PLEX. CCP needs to pay the bills.
---
CCPlz no more instances pvp arenas. Thanks . If you need a special place to have fights go use sisi. You bads keep shitting up Eve with wanting special snowflake treatment
---
Another fella from the crowd steps forward to show he too has never taken a frigate fleet against a stuka or goku comp. Anyone else lining up to prove they have uninformed opinions?
---
I could get down with that. Like make it into a special event, that way if its a special occasion type thing you can keep the hype train rolling and make sure that when its on it will be easy to get quick fights.
---
Everyone just say it's bad so they can spend those resources on fixing Tranquility. Thanks.
---
So one theme I've noticed in your post is that you call hunters lazy. So let me offer you a lens through the other side of the coin as someone who likes going on covert ops fleets. For this experience I'll tell you one of the few experiences I've had with bombers bar.
---
So there I am, forming up with bombers bar, we form up in Thera and wait around for a little bit as our Hunter/killer is flying through null finding a target. While he's looking we maneuver through a wormhole into kspace from Thera. From there we form up on the bridge and wait for the fuel truck to arrive so that we have enough fuel to bridge everyone through. We hear some chatter from the H/K and we get the order to bridge. We land in belt after maybe 30 minutes of forming up and preparing the fleet. 
---
Three Rorquals are in belt so the FC tells us which to focus on. The Rorqual switches to combat drones and we quickly work to defang him. Once he gets down to ~20% structure he pops a cyno and hits his PANIC button and gets his 7 minute invulnerability timer. 
---
Not long after a Nyx loads grid. We shift focus onto the nyx and it's fighters. Before we can do much 5 more carriers load grid now we are just overwhelmed and realize that it's time to big out. We all burn out of the bubbles our H/K placed and warp off to random celestials and cloak up.
---
From there we form back up and continue the hunt in another system. This happens roughly 3 more times before we call it quits and bridge back to the hole to Thera. There is so much effort and time put into each of those bombers bar fleets and from the people in those fleets to get their ships and to move them. The logistics involved in each of those fleets are insane. So please I hope that you understand that hunters have to go through a lot in order to get content that often doesn't even pan out into anything fruitful. 
---
Keep in mind that this was post-blackout. Pre-blackout I remember being on some fleets where we would just sit in Thera for several hours then stand down because the H/K couldn't find anything. That's the perspective I'm coming from as someone who is a casual BB participant.
---
Eve redditors want the citadel spam. Why am I not surprised. Remove asset safety fix timers and give the players an incentive to clean up the mess.
---
&gt; EVE: The second genesis,
---
i.... wow you are correct, damn
---
&gt; would just come back again at some point.
---
Without skill injectors, you wouldn't see caps for many months. Proliferation would take years and years because without injecting, a lot of people will not devote the training time to it.
---
THERE'S LITERALLY A WAR GOING ON RIGHT NOW YOU IDIOTS!
---
&gt; good long while
---
it wouldnt be long. skill injectors are a thing rorqmining/capumbrella/superumbrella would be back withing no time... 
---
as i said, if you dont change CORE gamemechanics a ''wipe'' wouldnt make ANY sense. and if you fix these core gamemachanics  you might aswell just keep your current playerbase instead of risking loosing a big part of it that isnt interested in the grind anymore.
---
because lets be honest. PVE in eve with very few exceptions is utter garbage
---
Fugg is potat.
---
Didnt realize it got dithered fml
---
what kills the frigs in those comps arent the bombers, let akone their bombs, its the anti tackle such as kikis. Don't try to change the topic from bombers and their bombs to a specific fully fledged comp
---
Have some silver. 
---
Pixels are pixels. The moment you learn that this game opens up to a whole new level
---
Yea, part of the process is to answer a few questions but it's not anything serious. We just want to get to know who you are and what you're looking for out of the game/community. Other than that, as long as you haven't done any really bad things towards TEST and friends, you should be good. It's worth a shot at least.
---
Yeah I'm not too bad at this game should be easy.
---
yes...but only if they also add "arranged fights" between parties, (2vs2 and 5vs5) with actual destruction of ships/goods and a supported betting system within.
---
I don't comment on where I live or who I fly with. I like the anonymity
---
Nah, they all were empirebuilders that quit because of blackout and not because of massive changes benefitting the turtling krab meta like fatigue, fozziesov and shitadels, right?
---
&gt; So what happens when the people who want risk free/easy PvE just leave?
---
Eve began losing players way before blackout/cyno changes. If we let them reign the invalidated PvP'er side leaves. 
---
So we argue for a more balanced game and hope for the best.
---
It can be a fun game and the most frustrating game at the same time. I've won Eve many times, but like a psycho-ex, Eve is always there. 
---
IMO the most import thing is to find a good corp. One that's not toxic, one that's not too serious (it's a game after all). I still talk to a few guys from my first corp (from 2006). 
---
Reddit is full of drama and people like to bitch and moan. So grab some popcorn and don't take it too serious. 
---
Currently winning Eve for the Nth time.
---
I've always wondered how did they get those detailed lines on the model. I'm assuming it's manual texturing
---
Chess is an outlier, has simple rules but great amount of depth.

I mean, I have a hound with like 30 kill marks from a cormorant fleet... so, ok...
---
Right click &gt; Trash it...
---
Or fit it for fun and autopilot somewhere. zkill shows these with 0.01 ISK, right?
---
I do agree on these, except you conveniently left out how much easier it was made to be safe for roaming and hunting
---
Interceptors becoming nullified, t3cs being able to use covops and nullified, injected cyno alts and bomber alts with free sp made hunting safely and traveling to set up traps all the safer
---
Citadels allowed tethered jump chains of dread bombs and npc stations are still permanent invincibility
---
Downvote me all you want you entitled bitch :)
---
Which bit am I wrong about? That your friends are too cheap to buy a 1 month sub to test out a game they are interested in? Or is it the bit where they have some other reason for playing it other than because they are interested? The first one I get, but if it's the 2nd I'd love to know what it is.
---
Longbow Cormorants  
---
they teach you alot of stuff you need, probing, positioning, warping fleet, pre alining etc
---
Olmeca does need it
---
Pilot License Extensions have been around since before I started in 2010. What is your issue with it?
---
alright then, how big is your group? Is it mandatory that you form up for these ihub timers? If youre in a smaller alliance these ihubs can most usually be defended by kity gang fleets, without expecting much resistance and usually open for the possibility to set up gatecamps instead. If you are in one of the big nullblocs i certainly doubt you absolutely have to join every entosis fleet.
---
Give it away to the folks in Jita local
---
Merlins can be fun in numbers.
---
Tristans swarms the enemy with countless drones.
---
Thrashers with artillery are good for gate camping.
---
Not on a bomber
---
Totally different company.
---
If i engage things in frigates, i will be putting in far more effort in execution because i put in so little effort into setting up.
---
it‚Äôs like me saying i mines up a titan using velators with civilian lasers you have no idea how hard mining is and how long it took!
---
It‚Äôs a fallacy, you CHOOSE difficulty in execution and CHOOSE to go for targets you know are harder to kill with what you prepared. 
---
You CHOSE frigates because they‚Äôre cheap and easy to set up and take zero effort to plan for besides going on the way and then fearing drones. 
---
Out of all the options you had, you chose that because it‚Äôs quicker and easier and less effort intensive
---
Yes.  I don‚Äôt care how you spin it, that‚Äôs lazy.
---
Subcaps... aren‚Äôt capitals...
---
their sub.. capitals... you fucking mango
---
Not to nitpick here, but the definition of chaos would mean it is uneven
---
:) fun
---
Good idea! maybe it's possible to make a really cheap frigate loss mail?
---
[deleted]
---
So you're arguing against me despite never playing the other game? Cmon now mate...
---
Well, not as cheap as unfitted but yeah. Should generate some long faces.
---
Get back to me when you are on your desktop then.
---
You must hate karma
---
hell no
---
CCP is aware on that, the bug is hard to catch, so that even for me abyssal pvp is done at 1300 ET
---
I don't care
---
Random is from America too! Must be the same person.
---
When the top post is a stain guy post, you've done something wrong.
---
Who?
---
I would love it. Most of EvE's problems are because you can't undo some of the stuff that was implemented. If the new game offered solutions for some of the key issues like capitals online, skillfarm online etc. I would gladly give up on my current progress.
---
Fit some, put the rest in a cargo container in the hol
---
make them think they‚Äôve got the jackpot and waste so much time digging
---
scrams on t1 frigs reach 30 + km now?
---
so you are saying people aren't allowed to quit eve?
---
i mean honestly, maybe people just don't want to play the game with the changes? people stopped playing wow, and when wow classic comes out, they are litterally standing IN LINE IN A QUE to wait to play the game.
---
do you think that there MAY BE A REASON why they want to play the old wow vs the new and current wow?
---
Now, i'm not saying that the older iterations of EVE are perfect. far from it. However the current iteration if eve is FAR FAR different and include a huge different play style than eve used to have. Now, for example some people have come back to eve recently (not just because of the black out but because other games have changed that they were playing and they were not happy there) and we should be happy to see them come back, but that doesnt' mean people are not allowed to leave because ccp is changing the game into a way that they do not want to play. 
---
Yes, people will have to adapt to play the new version of eve. That maybe isn't for them. if ccp want a different game to be played then they will have different costumers.
---
Injector adjustment is too complicated. SP hardcap at 50 million skill points.
---
This will allow you to catch up with his character without being exaggerated.
---
Phantasm fleet :P
---
Obviously, but *at some point* it will be back. Supercap blobs were around before injectors too. Injectors just made it worse.
---
I get 114km heated with one of my better Abyssal points and skirm mindlinked command ship boosts....think it was 103km? When I did it with mindlinked command dessy boosts before a friend got in his command ship (alt does have BC lvl 5/command ship 5) and... Think it was a 34.7km base Abyssal point on a lach... So in theory you can get close to this number if you have a bling ass max rolled faction Abyssal point closer to 36km....
---
By the way... Buy and sell Abyssal mods, it's good for you and will make you super elite pvp'r, and my wallet thicker (one of these is maybe true)
---
Have to reskill core skills and AWU5 lol no.
---
Clownshoe nereus w/ drones and light remote shield reps
---
A sandbox game has pvp. Wow is not a sandbox game.
---
Why are you arguing this? A sandbox game has PVP, and PVE. Your playstyle my stress one or the other but both are valid.
---
Minecraft is a sandbox game. So by your logic, Minecraft is a PVP game. Stop being obtuse.
---
I don't believe this would address the issue people are having which is day old capital alts. You could argue the proposal wouldn't stop this also, but it surely would make it more expensive. In the current situation its not an issue of older players using skill injectors. Its people making new characters and getting into Supers/Titans within a few hours.
---
&gt;  Because you don't do those.
---
you neither
---
So you literally have done the exact same thing as the video shows. Good story.
---
probably not
---
Can you not reprocess?
---
Skill injectors did not change the ability of someone to buy plex and get themselves into a titan. Before injectors people just bought the whole character. The big change in skill injectors was the finer grained skill boosts. If you remove injectors, you just shift the SP trade back to character trading.
---
Wouldn't dream of it edgelord.
---
But make sure whatever you are in is irrationally tanky, so they have to work for it, then autopilot through niarja and uedama.
---
Just trash it.
---
Maybe everyone just stopped being stupid for a day?
---
or you could kill it , no reason to involve CCP
---
Choas era boyyos even the trigs are invested
---
"So whats the deal about this Bunny Ranch place?
---
Just asking for a friend."
---
This solves few problems.
---
A decent dread pilot is only 20m skillpoints.
---
The stuff implemented isn't the issue , its alternate characters and addition accounts that kill eve
---
I love this :)
---
Moronic argument, terrible logic. Try this one with a child. Might work with the bugblatter beast from hitchhikers guide as well.
---
Besides being able to change skills, there isn't any new feature, the app looks absolute garbage on Android, and don't get me started on the usability. 
---
It's not that surprising, yet still disappointing, that CCP came up with the cheapest/lowest common denominator to support most mobile devices.
---
Third-party apps still win the show in my opinion; let's see if it's going to be updated as much as the previous "Portal".
---
No, after 12+ years of paying hard cash on four accounts ... I just couldn't do that.
---
I've been Skilling since the dawn of Eve. When I couldn't use or fly.something. it was something to look forward to. Now.ita just instant gratification playerbase. And then they complain about not having content
---
I figured it was something like that.  With as complex as EVE is it makes sense to not just let anyone come join/rep/partake of your hard earned name and resources.  Definitely had me up wondering if it was a bad thing to buy some skill injectors and to not remember your other old EVE account details from a decade ago.  Still no idea if I'm actually cut out for the whole "TEST in nullsec" thing but only one way to find out.
---
I'm sure it is üôÑ
---
Do you have a ship suggestion? I mean, if I go with a ship with no offence and just all tank what ship would be best?
---
They probably went away, like the Drifters in NS before them, and CCP is about to unleash a new plague.
---
Either that or CCP fucked something up vOv
---
&gt; the arazu only has to sit for 30s. If you cant do 2.2-2.5k/s you are still pointed when the arazu can chase you
---
What can't do that for 30secs of heat though, when it's probably the only midslot you need to be heating. A pure PvE ship with AB? Probably should have been aligned and warped before the decloak locking delay downside of a recon.
---
Feroxes, Muninns, Eagles.......................... online.
---
Well when I started people had to pay subs. Most of our demographic was NOT neckbeards no lifers who live in grandma's basement eating hot pockets and plexing 100 accounts. That's my issue with it. It opened the faucet for people whos entire career is no lifing an MMO.
---
Most definitely bro! Hop on our discord and there are alot more there that could answer any questions you have.
---
Goons beat them.
---
Still funny as heck but, Eve now ... just skill inject and bang!  All done.
---
This is EVE, what are the odds of that?
---
1. Like it was stated before. If you had 100 titan pilots in eve and you bought one ... it was still 100 titan pilots in eve.               
---
2. Injectors are to long with us, sadly they need to stay.          
---
What need to be regulated is how much we can produce them - aka skill farms need to go one way or another. CCP can think about making them unprofitable and for sure disable ability to train and extract 3 chars on account.              
---
I know it is bad for their business - but maybe someone at CCP will notice that stuff that is happening now is much worst for their business.                  
---
Injector usage also need to be regulated in different way. Skills need to be split on like 5 or 6 level each much worst at injecting ^(so no matter your current SP level).              
---
For example if you want to inject 2mil sp in cruisers ... you need 2mil SP in injectors, but if you want to inject stuff like capitals, jump skills ... or rorquals. To get this 2mil sp  you need to have from 16 to 20mil SP in injectors.                
---
So how much sp you get base on the skill 'level' not your SP.            
---
This can be actually done pretty easy - skills in the unallocated quene are recalculated at the moment of injection and simple window say how much you need SP to advance specific skill.
---
Rr algos's
---
It's a difficult concept I know but you'll get it in the end.
---
Yes it is balanced because believe it or not, these don't make you THAT much better... Still boils down to the pilot more often the not... Trust me I'm a great example of this lol.... I love Abyssal mods, probably my #1 Income source and I fly them on everything... And can confirm I'm still a mediocre pilot... But damn I can smash that F1 button... (Or in the case of my 112km fleet webs F2)
---
Absolutely fucking not
---
"shitadels"

who hurt you

No skill inyectors or plex in wow clasic, 2019 EVE is easier.

They tried having drifters to an invasion of nullsec. And look how that turned out...

Most of the neighborhood i live in is various asian groups. Half the liquor stores seem to be run by eastern europeans. My tax guy is Russian. Theres a ton of indians and middle easterners.
---
More specifically, the ore that typically spawns in anomalies in hisec are dense, which means you mine less of the actual ore per cycle, thus making them less profitable per cycle than something lighter, like veldspar.  That said, mining scales well with force multplication, which is why it is common to see multiple accounts running miners, haulers, and boosters.  The haulers keep the miners on site longer for more ore.

Folks like Kristal find enjoyment and isk via other means.
---
Yes, shield buffer Caracal with Scythes for logi.  Fun and versatile.
---
I think the idea was fine and \*almost\* well executed imo. They just....stopped doing it and didn't followup on it.
---
that too, but much of the problem with for example capitals is that at some point they became too easy to get, and once everyone has them you can't make them disappear. If, on the other hand, you had for example much higher cost of building them, you could postpone that problem.
---
&gt; The null sec blocks do not want to fight
---
As a member of a small corp in NPC null: Logistics.  I can't buy hulls/equipment on the local market.  I'm not at the point where I can be self sufficient even if I was to fly T1 Cruiser or smaller, T1 fit.  Losing a ship to pvp means a logistical headache, 25+ jumps.  
---
I don't have 3-4 alts(JF + Cynos) to go shopping.  My main is ~15M SP.
---
So yeah, I pvp in small fleets(5-10 players), but replacing a ship is me having to ask a corpmate to bring me one down on the next JF run.  With blackout we're mining a lot less (personally like blackout) which compounds the issue slightly.  And jumping those freighters less as well.
---
And is it me or has Mexallon gone up in price a decent bit?
---
If you started after the introduction of alphas, you're still an eve youngster, maybe not infant, pre-teen perhaps
---
You seem to think nullsec was harder than highsec pre 2019.. lmao
---
2017 he changed the game by having his own soundbox.  2019 HE HAS HIS OWN REACTION GIFS
---
No lol
---
Yesterday I queued up when I got home from work at 6pm. We went out to dinner with friends until 10pm and when we got home there was still 2771 people in front of me. I had to wait until 12.15am before it let me in.
---
Not every time but probably half the time.
---
/u/ccp_falcon please look at this guy's suggestion. In my ears the solution to citadels.
---
Oh now i feel older than i should üò•
---
LOL last line cracked me up ü§£
---
Seems to be the former. There are some new Trigs on hoboleaks and a new transfer conduit.
---
wingspan, everyone
---
I'm going to slightly disagree with your second paragraph, it is definitely player driven but CCP enabled. They haven't helped the process. Not sure how you fix it bc you're right about different cycles instead
---
I feel like the commentary of FCs and fleets are the only thing that interest me. Their communications and callouts are neat, the gameplay not so much.
---
We don't have big Titan battles because you have 80% of null blued up (primarily TAPI being the subservient no 2) and 20% simply won't go head to head on those odds.
---
It's been years and years since there was a subservient no 2. 
---
That's why there no Titan fights. Cyno changes are relatively smaller factors in overall meta.
---
CODE, despite it's trollish nature operates fully within the established rules that govern hisec.  They crash and burn to do what they do right alongside their targets.  The largest distinction is they don't deliberately target newbros to shit on, and spend significant effort for the success they achieve.
---
The inherent risk is there already especially if CCP implements my suggestion of ‚Äúperiodic‚Äù and ‚Äúunannounced‚Äù blackouts. Hunters require prey and prey exists in a false inherent sense of safety. When there is no prey, what‚Äôs the point of playing for hunters?
---
Always looked forward to named expansions. Was exciting to feel like it was really something new. With the changed login screen image and song.
---
If eve doesn't go completely F2P with PLEX or $15.00 sub option for perks it'll die. As much as it pains me to say that. The $15 per month (on 5+ account) barrier to entry is huge. Like you said, why would someone play eve for three or four hours for the dopamine rush when they can get it from plenty of other games in a little over thirty minutes?
---
Before I quit (lack of time) I played eve fairly regularly for ten years. It's truly sad to see this happen to one of my favorite games of all time.
---
Fleet fights are a snooze fest, but small scale stuff is fun to watch for me. 
---
Haven't played much in years, but I still watch Lussy Lou videos !
---
Just need the middle ground.
---
What do you expect? People here dont want a restart. They want to eat their cake... They also want to eat your cake, and mine. Also our lunch money...
---
Because any idiot in a frigate attacking bombers would make sure they get within 30km of then immediately and not to group up. The odds of hitting a fast moving target like a frigate with a group of bombs would be a hell of an achievement.
---
I would bounty hunt for skill points! üòÇ /u/ccp_falcon
---
EVE at the Art House 2020?
---
No, EVE at some guy named Art's house 2020
---
You asked a simple question.
---
I answered. If you think I conveniently left something out, it's because your looking for validation, not answers.
---
tanked Nereus?
---
You already had your Fest on Volcano Island.
---
The San Diego fest is probably aimed at luring more asians and Aussies. Though im not sure how the latter will acclimate to proper gravity.
---
I like watching solo video's or when people are outnumbered. I enjoy lasker cap videos the most.
---
Solo videos are great, since you can see precisely what the pilot recording did, heat management, distances, piloting and so on; while at the same time seeing some close images of the ships and the usual effects.
---
Watching medium to large battles is as boring as it gets.
---
Something something boosh.
---
"Balanced@ 2x mwd bs and "Balanced" -90% web on all ships?  
---
broken beam guns on phantasm? no thx
---
What you're asking for is a new region accessible only through a small hole. That's the farthest thing possible from starting over.
---
You can come eat my cake any time you want... if you can.
---
Look those up on soundcloud, CCP uploaded everything there.
---
Lol, your border skirmish / tower spammery with frat is nothing. 
---
Grow some balls and fight a real war.
---
Ted, I need a new carrier. Lol
---
I regret that I have but one upvote to give
---
How is it bad? You keep your hard earned skills. Just need to figure out how to rebuild.
---
Also, I don't like cake... It was just an analogy :)
---
What if there was a limit to how much you can inject for cap based skills? I would actually like not being able to inject SP into any cap based skills.
---
Wow what does that mean? Some exiting news ahead??
---
Only interesting if there is comms and/or commentary.
---
Lol who are you and what do you know?  Max sized fleets fighting every day man
---
Netease is not CCP.
---
Turning Moons?
---
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!
---
Nereus could be good, I think that's the name, the t1 version of the gallente blockade runner.
---
Thing can actually do some interesting pvp (or at least could) as well.
---
Maybe all the idiots just decided to come to /r/EVE instead. I think Olmeca put a post out around that time.
---
put them on t1 frigs and disappoint lootwhores when they drop.
---
&gt; Are the big 4 factions unable to mount an effort against null?
---
You're literally screeching all day long about null being scary wwithout local because people might want to shoot you but you want to have the NPCs attack Null.
---
Seriously, you know there's already a mechanic for you to do that, right? Why do you bother logging in if you need the NPCs to do everything for you?
---
I wonder if you may actually be a prolific troll doing a great job of lampooning krabs. If that's the case, I want to congratulate you for an excellent job.
---
It still bothers me that this curve is backwards, with time on the x-axis it is saying you gain a sharp increase in skill as time goes on, much faster than the other games, so actually this graph is saying the exact opposite of what it's trying to convey.
---
ah, yes. Comms/commentary does help a wee bit
---
sorta. just with a bit more salt . dont get me wrong i would play it too but more ironcly  than  i allready.
---
Except as we agreed, the situation before requires incompetence on behalf of the target as opposed to competence on behalf of the hunters.
---
That's the problem.
---
Luckily we also agree that black out brings this risk. No need to make it periodic or unannounced. Just make it permanent.
---
well if people only had the 1 charater , capitals would be harder to make because you cannot sit there with 8 rorqual toons so chew on rocks , you also wouldn't have a character sitting in the capital umbrella to be ablro to also protect these toons. so much of the game is ruioned by addtional accounts and alts . its really the root issue for almost everything .
---
Yes please buff the nestor.. it's definitely a weak ship... please...
---
Not sure I know of any other 600 dps subcap logi with nice agility and decent tank
---
&gt;***&gt;  Eve can't afford to get more empty when it is a game so reliant on interactions between players,***  
---
This is the point that more and more people realize. You need numbers in this game not only to pay for the cost of the servers and CCP upkeep (AT, community employees, etc), but PVPers need prey. 
---
Having an environment where the false sense of safety was removed aka local, has drastically reduced the human prey population. 
---
CCP could have balanced so many other things such as increasing wormholes into null or periodic blackouts to still have safety (and remove it right under for a few hours, e.g. sensors are under maintenance), but instead CCP went with total removal of local and wildlife preserves. Only large organizations have any realistic prey. Both dotlan and MER data clearly shows the wildlife preserves and their prey have dropped off the cliff, and it takes hours of real life time to get any targets.
---
Here‚Äôs an example of what I mean:
---
https://youtu.be/UNk_SjC966M
---
used for wh ratting
---
used for smartbombs in fleets
---
used to refit  in fleets
---
quite good as logi with a few shaks  (null/wh)
---
basically every super with half a brain has one in its hangar
---
fun as a solo memeboat
---
i mean... what more do you want? it might not be too good to camp HS holes. imo there are ships that need a balance pass/buff way more than a nestor
---
You've never used a nestor in a WH have you?
---
Fresh start? Nope. Reroll to a previous patch? I‚Äôd consider it.
---
"Sure, sounds great as long as it's *your* resources that dwindle, not mine. Touch my income and I will screech like a tomcat with it's balls caught in a vice"
---
 \- EVE players
---
There isn't loads of reddit posting about it so it doesn't count.
---
Most of those uses are better/easier/cheaper with another ship, no?
---
I‚Äôm not just going t1 for the cost but to maximize the number of people who can come with the fleet using the doctrine. 50 loki drop is hilarious (had it dropped on me) but I don‚Äôt have 50 people ready to go at all times with strat cruisers.
---
I... I could finally be free again!
---
My cousins neighbors cat says this is false.
---
How does T2 frigate loot compare to T1 frigate loot?
---
No SWToR no win. EVE rules them all.
---
No, fuck that and fuck you for asking.
---
https://youtu.be/-K7fCQlUhj0
---
I finally figured mine out, but I don't see any flair on you
---
well Wingspan is an exception, indeed. The guy is a pro at making entertaining content.
---
It's a joke meme. You'll figure it out in the end.
---
&gt;Nestor
---
&gt;Jack of all trades
---
...wut? The Nestor is an insanely tanky armor logi battleship that can use drones. That's its job, and it's the only battleship that can properly do this.
---
lol nope
---
the tank and rep amount is invaluable for subcap wh ratting 
---
other bs can use a full set of sb, but they have fewer slots and far worse maneuverability 
---
no other subcap allows refitting 
---
same as first point but for pvp. rep amount and tank and utility slots (and sensor strength) is second to none
---
Ugggghh, one of my stupidest, most stubborn pet peeves is the phrase, "...steep learning curve." 
---
That means the one learns really quickly and subsequent skill increases rapidly. Which is EXACTLY what the graph shows. 
---
What people mean is that the effort vs learning curve is steep. As in maximum effort is required to learn the most basic things.
---
give me a subcap shiphull, that is used for that amount of different things and is actually good at it... im waiting
---
i can see that pov.
---
Hmm.. eve online fortnite mode you say.. that might be a great idea!
---
What if you had an arena the size of a solar system and the space shrinks over time down to a few km.
---
Everyone starts in a pod, and have to warp between planets and belts to find ships and equipment (at mobile depots), then you have to pick your fights, pick where to warp, and make lots of tactical decisions.
---
The only thing I'd like them to add would be that if you go out of line of sight, the opponent loses his targeting, that definitely would enhance pvp.
---
underdog vids can be really good. I have enjoyed a few of those.
---
kitchen sink
---
Fair enough, so your version of ‚Äúwhy‚Äù is that both sides getting buffed doesn‚Äôt matter because one side is part of that.
---
And changing things will fix the damage of people being able to play safer than you‚Äôd like (only on the pve side though)
---
Then my only question for this.  What end result? Get all the old bitterkrabs to quit, thenlet in new people to do what?  
---
I joined this game because i enjoyed the aspect of building my own destiny and fleets and ships and a capital armada, it was cool to me.
---
Is the goal to make sure people like mestay away so the hunters can kill off the rest in safety?
---
that‚Äôs what i mean by why.  What is the ‚Äúend goal‚Äù for the game, on BOTH sides?
---
Give it a jump drive and cloak bonus.
---
Maybe a shorter base jump range to deal with it being a lower skill black ops.
---
No bridge though.
---
Depends.
---
So many of the videos are shit be ause it's just tmusic and sped up gameplay.
---
Good stuff with a real narrative is amazing thougg
---
What's the long-term plan for wow classic? Are they just releasing the oldest production release and leaving it up until the server grows empty or are they pulling a runescape-move and forking the game?
---
I'm with you on this hill. If I'm the one who has to clean it I'm not gonna make the mess bigger than it has to be.
---
Daves definitley not that lmao
---
This guy/gal Eve's...
---
Yeah it's actually weird.  I think it's because most the r/eve posters don't actually play
---
single cap gun abbadon here i come
---
It was ever thus.
---
As long as it's not on Dirty Sixth.
---
scout phase over, now its time to send a flock of diamond hac's onto every single mining belt in highsec
---
Can I have your alts stuff?
---
I think this is a great idea. It brings the PvE and PvP worlds together. I would enjoy playing this content.
---
I bet it was a long long wall of text
---
people would inject them in a week.
---
dont see why not? i mean sure shits fucked, but it would be fun for a bit
---
Put them in a t1 indy with pathetic tank, but make it look like you're trying. Throw on like one medium shield extender, warp stabs or something a noob might do. Then fly around in Jita going in and out of 4-4 and wait for cargo scans and a suicide gank on your fake goods. Place kill rights for 10-20 mil per ship, no one's gonna activate a 500m right on a tornado or catalyst, people who place these are genuinely stupid.
---
My personal favorite is: kitchen sink
---
Maximize fun and minimize seriousness
---
My serious choice for a new FC, start with corms or condors, they are fast and do ok dmg
---
No. The game needs to fix itself. I wouldnt start again facing the same issues.
---
Last time I had this issue, bricked Drake. As much bricked abyss mods as possible.
---
It got some odd looks from my corp when it finally died
---
If I recall, currently the plan is the slowly drip feed the content like in the original release up until the final patch prior to burning legion. So things like Ahn'Qiraj, opening of Naxxramas etc are being introduced eventually.
---
Switch the axes labels.
---
for wh ratting,  rattlesnakes
---
for smartbombs, any battleship honestly. but rokhs prefered
---
for refit.....the onlything nestor really has (and why its used so much as a free refit in supercaps. why use mobile when u can drop nestor, refit, and redock it.
---
for logi.  guardians.  though i should note nestor is the only battleship logi of note...only other is marauders...and yeah....  we lack battleship sized logi.
---
as a solo memeboat...its one of the worst outside of suicide meme.
---
&gt;  If you don‚Äôt want to be at 0 I guess you‚Äôll have to cloak and get yourself into position.
---
Cap balls are dense.  You will be within 2000m of something.
---
&gt; T3c‚Äôs nullified could get into position.
---
If they're also covert and you're trying to do this cloaked, see above.  If they're not cloaked, they're gonna die before they can be useful.
---
&gt;  If it‚Äôs specifically timers you are worried about why not get cyno‚Äôs in position in the week you have to prepare?
---
Because your cyno position is relative to the opposing cap fleet, which isn't there yet.  With that giantic hit box on Keepstars (and to a lesser extent Forts), there's too much volume to realistically cover with pre-positioned cynos.
---
&gt; Your bumping issue is going to happen whether you cyno on grid, off grid or next door - both sides will have to deal with it
---
No, one side will cyno in at the objective before the other.  That first fleet will not have significant problems cynoing in wherever they want - subcaps aren't going to be able to kill their cyno ships fast enough to completely stop them.
---
The problem is getting the *second* fleet there so that there is a battle.
---
&gt; You could use multiple cyno‚Äôs if you are fielding a hundred caps ?
---
Makes the partial bubbling problem worse.
---
&gt; Yes dictors will slow you down but if a hundred caps can‚Äôt kill a few sabre alts 
---
I don't think you understand just how many sabres we burn through during these capital battles.  It's not just a "few" alts.  It a lot of them, constantly reshipping from a cache that holds thousands of sabres.
---
&gt; I guess it will be difficult to have a hundred guys act as a unit
---
"Act as a unit" isn't the problem.  The game responding to that unit is.
---
The game has been min maxed so hard the "race for a titan" wouldn't be as long as some may think. The sp and wallet people have aren't what makes them strong, it's their knowledge of how to generate isk. This knowledge would follow them to classic.
---
Also stop with the fucking eve classic shit it ain't gonna happen.
---
Yeah, its exactly the same.  Minus the fleet comp thing that allows us to take fights because we're working with limited numbers and can't just blob the shit out of people with effortless "piloting" and no doctrine.  I guess the limited number thing is different too.  We have about an order of magnitude fewer people - but hey that's just a minor difference right?
---
Full flight of geckos please! Lol
---
and by every definition of the word, it's correct.
---
I actually like this idea quite a bit.
---
You completely missed the point, congratulations.
---
&gt;Literally every single mechanic exists in service to PvP.
---
Minecraft is not a PvP game, because there are mechanics that are not in service to PvP. And also because it has a singleplayer mode, where PvP is (hopefully obviously) not a thing.
---
Nah. I would use that chance to win eve.
---
We literally had three in the last year.  Would have been more, but NC fled from Goons.
---
son we need to teach you how to bump people properly
---
stop manual clicking. Make a BM between them and the citadel center. Approach enemy. Approach bookmark. Repeat.
---
Interesting! I'm not a wow player, is there something significant about the burning legion release that they used it as a stopping spot?
---
&gt;  split between PvP "extremists" and mega krabs.
---
This isn't true. There are PvPers who do nothing but because they already have all the isk they'll need and so look down on the poors who have to grind for their money. On the krabbing side most are making isk with which to PvP.
---
But you're right. Both are valid, and it's important to maintain a good balance between them. Balance too much in favor of the wolves, and the sheep die out and the game dies. Balance too much in favor of the sheep and the wolves die out and the game dies.
---
Would be nice if it could actually fit a full rack of heavy neuts or lasers.
---
Burning Legion is the first expansion where a massive new continent and flying mounts were ibtroduced in. Also new skill where you could craft certain items, new races for both Horde and the Alliance. Lots of changes.
---
Fucking genius.
---
&gt; There's more than just 30k some capsuleers in this game, there's thousands of npcs.
---
so your solution to not having enough PVP going on is to enable forced PVE to make up for the lack of PVP? That sounds like the same kind of stupid that gave us that sad sack of shit that was the drifter "event".
---
It was the first boxed expansion. Unlike EVE, most other MMOs release paid expansions every 6 months to 2 years on top of the subscription fee.
---
Do they plan on eventually releasing the expansions slowly?
---
There was a full new continent, flying mounts, le maximum level was 10 more so all talents trees were changed with new "ultime" talents, and two new races (blood elfs and weird-blue-things) with their own starting zones (and two new captial cities). Big changes.  
---
Also their was the Paladin class only accessible to the alliance, and the Shaman class only for horde. After Burning Crusade, the blood elfs (horde) could be paladins and blue-things (alliance) could be shaman.
---
First off I think it being the jack-of-all trades master of none is pretty much what they wanted it to be like, that's the point.
---
Secondly, blops plz
---
You are stackƒ±ng 25.000 real players ƒ±n a sƒ±ngle umbrella and referrƒ±ng their collective effort as if it's the thing that warrants risk free farm. While most of these people's best achievement is merely joining an alliance. What have these individuals done to deserve risk free farm? One of our points is that risk mitigation should involve more than joining an alliance and lighting a cyno for the individual.
---
Meanwhile, risk and your ability to mitigate it doesn't emerge in a vacuum and does not depend only on your effort. Your ability to feed 25k players in a single region, project capitals freely without obstruction, delay death by huge capital ehp's and PANIC are all gifts given to you by CCP. You've grown so entitled to those you don't even question them. Risk-free farm is not something you achieve by yourself or as an alliance. CCP enables you to risk-free farm. CCP can take it away if it's harming the game.
---
Lastly, your point that "hunters choose not to engage" is so idiotically trivial that you can defend any OP mechanic with it. If Keepstars had an hourly "destroy every non-blue ship in the region" button, and hunters argued that it's OP, you could say "hunters can attack our Keepstars but they choose not to engage". There is no choice dude. There is literally no option to kill a non-afk Rorqual under the Delve umbrella. Subcaps can't engage the umbrella head on. And if people brought enough capitals against yours, you would dock and move to hisec (happened before). 
---
Frankly your arguments are so weak and so old that its borderline unworthy for me to engage. I dealt the same arguments for 3 years now. There are so many entitled zealous null linemembers with whom we went through the same debate. But now I actually don't have to engage with them as I have bigger things to do.
---
&gt;because lets be honest. PVE in eve with very few exceptions is utter garbage
---
You can take the qualifier out of that.
---
&gt;Then I realize I don‚Äôt care and the game doesn‚Äôt even need you.
---
people like you will say that till the player count hits 5,000 at peak time, then suddenly its going to be "where did everyone go? CCP why did you drive all my targets out of the game?"
---
I second this.  It's a very forgiving comp, even if you make a couple mistakes.
---
Leshak?
---
ibeast stuff can be entertaining, not those 4hr roam vids tho
---
Rest of eve: here is the reason you died this is a new thing dont fight them alone they're dangerous
---
Goons: adapt or die our playstyle got butt raped now we mad at all u noob lose orca wow low sec stain gate reee
---
Don't think Blizzard has commented on that yet. If they do start releasing expansions, I hope they do stop at the end of Wrath of The Lich King. It was basically the high-point of WoW for many, the next expansion completely reworked base game continents (everything before Burning Crusade) and added flying ability in those as well, so it changed a ton. That wasn't bad, WoW vanilla (base game) content was nefarious for grinding levels and it certainly brought some new stuff, but it sorta started to feel stale at that point, and for players who constantly want bigger levels and damage numbers, that isn't really what they want.
---
Also you sort of can't top The Lich King, as he was built to be THE main villain of the whole planet after Warcraft 3, which was a massive success. Blizzard is remaking that in HD if you're interested btw.
---
:-P
---
Train all those Battlecruiser skills instead of just one too.  No thanks.
---
That makes sense to use it as a cut-off, cool, thanks!
---
Hurricanes are good too. Both benefit a lot from some T1 logi and ewar
---
And costs pennies
---
found the adjunct assistant to the junior diplo
---
DYING SLOWLY
---
aye. if they let it do that. i'd be happy with it.   just give it a bonus to powergrid for those.
---
or give it some powergrid
---
I do, depends on the editing to be honest. I try to produce high quality niche content videos. I honestly find myself drawn to captured gameplay that I am not involved in, for curiosity or learning sake
---
Skill Injectors are a cash cow for CCP/PA and will never see significant nerfs
---
&gt;i dont think large groups are flexible enough to move area of operations around
---
LOL we already do this multiple times a month its called locust fleet. Make a change like the one you are asking for and we could weaponize locust fleet by taking it into your space and stripping out the resources you built the upgrades to get.
---
Loki?
---
It groups all of the player's losses into one column to save screen space. Press the (xx ships) button to expand the list and see the actual ship values.

Remember Red Vs Blue? I remember.
---
Reportedly, Triglavs stopped today.
---
&gt;i think they d hold sov for as long as it s feasible then pack up and move along
---
The current moon mechanics punish this type of playstyle, its takes months for a full frack on a single moon to develop, the refining rigs cost 100's of billions on a refining station already, imagine if people needed to keep rebuying them as they moved, no one would do it. This type of short sighter band-aid approach to fixing null is what Hilmar is already doing and the player count is dropping like a stone over it.
---
&gt; So the once-per-year fights
---
We had 3 in the last year.  Would have had more but NC fled from Goons.
---
&gt; Ccp shouldn't be avoiding changes they feel are needed because it changes the way that rare engagement works.
---
Problem is those battles are the ones that get media attention, and so attract the new players CCP desperately needs.  You killing a ratting ship doesn't.
---
bunch of players would go there thinking they'll be the envy of everyone in their super powered ship they got cause they so knowlegeable of eve due to playing modern eve.
---
then after a week in EVE classic they'll realize
---
1. its nothing like modern eve
---
2. they not top dog, they bottom of the pile. getting murdered by the real top dogs
---
3. they not as good as they think.
---
so they'll return to normal eve.   and the classic eve server will run out of players after 2 months
---
how do you do it
---
I have so many questions
---
I think it would be neat if they put it on like 3 or 4 year cycles where they release the expansions every few months until hitting current expansion where the characters are offloaded onto the regular servers and the cycle begins anew.
---
tbh the hardest part of industry is the spreadsheet you need to make it worth
---
&gt; Eliminate the pirate campers
---
I'd suggest to join pirate campers instead. :)
---
&gt;I want the null blocks to become smaller and thus more vulnerable. Right now they re anything but.

The harder you try to drive an established group apart, the more they are going to group up and stick together to counter the increasing disadvantage you are trying to put that at. Sooner or later they start to take it personal and their motivation switches from "I want to have fun",  to "fuck that guy for thinking he can break us up".
---
Remove half the high slots.
---
Give it a jump drive.
---
That would still need a lot of work to make it un-gamable. As it stands I could make a "killing", hehe, by using neutral alts to spy blingy Hisec mission runners, then use bounty hunter alt to go to the bounty agent nearest the target then get my null-alt to place a bounty (I'm already assuming that the victim will get informed by CONCORD why and who made them attack-able, if not I only need the spy and hunter chars) seconds before my hunter asks for a target. A high-enough % of the time I'll get the very guy I want to gank and my neutral alt (also coincidentally a scanner alt) gives my hunter a warp-in to the mission and boom, his blingy ass is mine.
---
Even without loot or a payout the griefing would be brutal. But I'll give you this - it's in the spirit of the Age of Chaos, that would just leave Wormholes to fuck-over and CCP would be done.
---
I would have three brackets to the system.
---
High Sec Bounty, if some one goes criminal on you, touches your loot, shoots your mtu etc then your allowed to place a Highsec Bounty on their head which can be collected in Highsec only by a bounty hunter who has your contract, you will only get a bounty on your head if you are a criminal in Highsec.
---
Low Sec Bounty, Can be put on some ones head in low sec, can be collected any where in low sec or nullsec, if collected in lowsec the bounter hunter gains a bonus.
---
Nullsec Bounty, Can be put on anyone, collected in Nullsec, and low sec, but collecting the bounty in Nullsec earns the bounty hunter a bonus.
---
That should prevent high sec players from being greifed while still allowing highsec cunts to be hunted.
---
I think bounty Hunters should get something akin to a criminal flag in the overview, something that on the overview says, Hay this guys a bounty hunter. thats about all the warning I think anyone should get, if their not paying attention to their overview then to bad. they shouldnt have pissed some one off enough to have a bounty put on them.
---
I think there should be a minimum price per bounty per region, so Highsec the minimum bounty should be 25mill, low sec 50mill, and nullsec 100mill this would kinda reflect the average price of ships flown regularly by people living in those regions.
---
The bonuses a hunter gets on completion could take the ship the bounty was in into account, so if their in something insane then give the bounty hunter a better bonus.
---
fanfest for the game, vegas for the players is how i've always thought about it.
---
Your missing my point as well. Be it a PVP oriented sandbox like Albion or Eve, or a exploration oriented one like Minecraft or whatever, it's a sandbox. You can choose how you want to play and what you want to do.
---
OP started with the typical "play like me or your doing it wrong" maybe that was not the body of his post, but I was checked out.
---
The Nestor is a strong independent explo ship that don't need no covops cloak. It has better scan bonuses than both the Astero and Stratios. It's mass lows it to fit through wormholes other battleships can't. It is quite quick and agile for a BS. It can fit a healthy tank either shield or armor. Gives you so much room for neuts it makes a Sin blush. They're viable logi platforms.
---
The fuck do you want? Only problem with it is being 650m+
---
hope the store runs out of bll
---
None of the others can go through a frig hole though.
---
Better chance of not collapsing a crit hole where any other large ship certainly would.
---
No one thanks to DPS caps lol
---
just glanced over this but i did a reply which solves some of this.
---
&gt; Though eves chief problem is the lack of developers that actually play the fucking game
---
i mean you could replace eves with wows right there and that statement would be just as true.
---
i would...but i'd rather steal their stargate, aim it at jita 4-4.  and start loading blood raiders like a giant gun
---
AT vids on YouTube that are cut down to just the fights are crack. The rest of it is just too much poop in the portapotty.
---
Holiday roam ships in the making....
---
Merlins with Bantams and a couple Ewar frigs (Maulus, Crucifier are the most annoying). It‚Äôs dirt cheap and you can move fast to catch targets instead of waiting for someone to form. 
---
Also you can do amazing things with comps like this assuming that you‚Äôve got like 10+ dudes
---
i could give you some, but you could also just as easily check zkb and easily find them for yourself to copy.  Honestly just try shit out, try to make sense of what you want and see if you/your guys can come up with a comp for it, and try it, itll be way more productive.
---
yes you will eat shit, yes odds are your first couple fits will be complete garbo, but the only people who can say they never fitted a ship like the average test member are the ones who never fitted a ship by themselves in the first place.
---
Fuck no
---
&gt; for wh ratting, rattlesnakes
---
bet it works great in wolf rayets. or in combination with shaks
---
&gt; for smartbombs, any battleship honestly. but rokhs prefered(and abbadons)
---
fc, what is 30% more speed, what are ''more'' ehp, what is better cap, what are more mids for utility, what is a bigger ship model and why is is so important for smartbombs....
---
i could go on and answer to the rest in basically the same way. but its quite obvious that you apparently have no clue what eft/pyfa is and youre just talking out of your ass
---
I think it's just culture changes, gamers are more and more used to instant gratification in their entertainment, their spoiled for choice on that end and eve is just far too much of a time investment overall.
---
Thankfully that lifestyle and the people it attracts are dead.
---
by that logic, go use a carrier for smart bombing.  or  a barghest
---
oh wait. ship cost is a factor. you dont bling fit your pipe bomb
---
specially when a nestor is currently 700-800m.  and a rokh is what...172m?
---
Bretty gud
---
You're high as fuck if you think vanilla raids were a challenge compared to current era raids. Vanilla raids barely rate the term.
---
The fobs are a fucking bitch to take out. I never managed to kill one.
---
Older players leave, newer players join. It‚Äôs the circle of life. If it dies, it dies.
---
Yeah they announce it if I remember
---
Sure, contract it to me.    
---
Do you have 2nd one maybe?
---
na, Customs took the 2nd when i tried to bring it through perimeter...something about "State property".  i tried to push it through the gate anyway and it got stuck. so i ran
---
No one killed the game. Your playstyle is just outdated.
---
If you can't handle me at my proteus, you don't deserve me at my loki
---
Would really like to see the Nestor get a cov ops bridge. Ccplz
---
Afghanistan and the Middle East beg to differ. This is the problem with equating real life to Eve.
---
For a suggestion that is a little different, look into a fit known as "gods of war". Its more or less a lowsec only doctrine, as it's trademark ship is 720mm arty Ruptures with no prop mod. Supported by Ospreys with... no prop mod. You get ridiculous amounts of tank and pretty solid alpha strike with the arties. Lots of fun and can punch way up, but will have difficulty against anything smaller than cruisers.
---
how is it possible to suck this much at bumping, its literally just flying far enough away and then hitting approach
---
tbh LK was just a fan boss, everyone loved who loved WC3 love to finally finish this arc, all the hate around cataclysm/MOP is just fucking stupid, MOP was by far the best expansion and cataclysm introduce real mechanics into raid the only thing people bitch about Cataclysm was dragon soul last 2 year while it was clean in 24 hour (korean group had month to prepare the raid in heroic difficulty, so all the progress was already made on PTR)
---
but tbh beside Vanilla I don't think the nostalgia will take for other expansion, Vanilla was so different, it brings back MMORPG from early 2000 with all the stupid mechanics (like hunt with leather/cloth/mail stuff etc) instead of working on a rework of BC/WOTLK I would love them to make the next expansion with all the good idea of the previous one, unlike what they did with bfa where they remove all the good idea...
---
just curious is isboxer against the tos? in other games like wow it isnt
---
And make it so the hull must be cheaper than the bounty to activate, to avoid 1isk bounty on everyone outside of jita or getting a nearly free kill right on l4 pimp ships... You want to see this rattle die? You must pay 400m boy!
---
And eventually mix NPC target between every player kill, to avoid some groups to ‚Äúdeplete‚Äù all bounties too fast or too much harassment.
---
I know the second part will be very unpopular.
---
Get evemon and import naglfar fit of your choice ezpz roughly 20-25b to inject fresh toon I‚Äôve done it a few times lol
---
Make a fit, export skill requirements. Add other essential skills. Profit.
---
If you're using something like a Stratios or t3 against cruiser-sized targets, one option is to get a good bump off: decloak 6(?)ish kilometers off, heat mwd, ram them while your decloak delay is wearing off. This has a decent chance of buying you enough time to land scram.
---
imagine thinking snakes are better for wh ratting than nestors
---
peak spodbrain
---
but a rank amateur at actually playing tbh
---
nice flair bait Lorenzo
---
&gt; by that logic, go use a carrier for smart bombing. 
---
oh, you mean that carrier that has extremely good agility and is perfectly able to burn after droneclusters/primaries. and also has alot of utility mids? the same carrier that is able to jump every wormhole except frigholes and is able to travel through HS without ANY problems?
---
&gt; specially when a nestor is currently 700-800m. and a rokh is what...172m?
---
please give me a rokh fit that fits into my armor doctrine with, lets go easy and say 250k ehp. (completely ignoring the reasons i mentioned above why the nestor is good)
---
Depends on how they are presented. If they have humor and an actual storyline they are pretty good. If it‚Äôs just shitty dubstep... nah
---
No u
---
No. This isn‚Äôt wow. Things that happened matter.
---
Okay makes sense
---
armor doctrine? Abaddon.  there ya go.
---
Yeah, but they just use spreadsheets made by some other dude in the Alliance, so it‚Äôs definitely just a mindless industry.
---
Then reread what you said above spodbrain
---
Wormholer, so no ships, and a lot more than you guys make
---
There would have to be reasons as to why and how you can place a bounty, otherwise innocent people in high sec will get ganked all day.
---
&gt; I like how you think subcap pve will make more per hour
---
Not what I asked. How many hours have you ratted or mined? since the blackout began? I assume you're using the same ship, of course.
---
Calling me idiotically trivial when you say nullsec is ‚Äúrisk free‚Äù because you just want to call it op.
---
The ability to mitigate risk exists by effort you would never dream of putting into the game and you‚Äôre mad others would.  If your opponent has a gun don‚Äôt show up with a stick then cry about it...
---
But instead let me respond to your ‚Äúop‚Äù comments
---
Yes. Let‚Äôs devolve into that.
---
Keepstars op cloaking op bombs op nullified op everything op jump drives op instawarp op f1 op overheating op dscan op local op zkill op krabbing op (roflmao) titans op frigates op nano op kitey op carriers op
---
Get that out of the picture.  We would be here all day with unproductive bitching at each other about how the others‚Äô playstyle has cancerous elements and we will get nowhere. 
---
You act like all of null went out there to become zkill fodder and the game is broken to hell because it isn‚Äôt as easy as that. 
---
you don‚Äôt get it dude.  When people banded together by the thousands it wasn‚Äôt to be your food.  It wasn‚Äôt to stroke your ego.  It was to build an empire.
---
Null sec, PLAYER OWNED, player defended, and player sov.  It‚Äôs why there‚Äôs no concord to protect anyone, you become your own safety.  you kill or be killed.
---
People didn‚Äôt choose to form empires because they had a choice, it‚Äôs the only way to compete against other empires from BoB to Goons, that‚Äôs sandboxes.  That‚Äôs pvp.  You enjoy smaller facets of pvp.
---
Good for you.  Nothing wrong with that.
---
You think you‚Äôre a hero bringing balance by whaling and ‚Äústopping the krab menace‚Äù bringing ‚Äúdanger‚Äù to the line members just trying to plex their accounts?
---
Fuck off, not good for you and you‚Äôre wrong with that. 
---
We both love eve and different facets of it.  I like killing big ships and flying them and doing great things people don‚Äôt even think possible. You like killing things but you don‚Äôt want to put in the same prep work or effort.  It‚Äôs not about ‚Äúyou have no choice‚Äù
---
You just refuse.  And you have nobody to blame for that but yourself.
---
You said it yourself, not everyone is rich enough to afford supers.  So what should they do?  Feed to invincible subcap gangs forever?  
---
No.  They HAVE to join the umbrellas to survive and grow.  If they want to grow, that is. 
---
And that‚Äôs toxic.  Forcing people into alliances or die is why we have what we have.  Zkillboard is a cancer that makes people go for the lowest hanging fruit not for casual fun
---
But for a god damn eve career.  That‚Äôs not okay.  It makes people just trying to get going prey to fuel people like you who only play for that purpose.
---
You CANNOT have one side without the other, olmeca.  That‚Äôs why your change suggestions fucking horrify me.  You will destroy what‚Äôs left of the game chasing more easy kills trying to hurt groups you aren‚Äôt even focusing on. 
---
You want to hate goons?  You want to hurt big bill blocs?  Focus on ways to endanger their assets.  Not make it harder to get more of them.  
---
Not their line members.
---
&gt; fc, what is 30% more speed, what are ''more'' ehp, what is better cap, what are more mids for utility, what is a bigger ship model and why is is so important for smartbombs....
---
in other words, NESTOR is the best at that job. and you just talked out of your ass
---
About 500M in salvage, minerals, and p4. Pretty good reason.
---
&gt; you fucking mango
---
dude, you do realize that your previous comment made it sound like you had to downgrade to a subcap from a cap, don't you?
---
It was great flying with ya brother o7
---
I'd love the name of the software if you ever come to remember!
---
and yet you ignore cost.
---
if you want to ignore cost, theres more expensive options.
---
but hey, if you want to spend 800m+ (or more as price goes up) for a pipebomb ship.  then please do come to geminate.  plenty of hordelings would love to murder your "suicide pipebomb"
---
while your at it. try plex tanking.
---
seriously, pick a role.
---
&gt; Risk-free farm
---
... simply shouldn't be risk free in nullsec. Concord specifically warns us (the first time at least) that we are entering lawless space and that we're risking our shit. Once you click, OK on that message, you've basically given permission to people to PVP you.
---
Not saying your other points were wrong but I think this is the one that should be the most blatantly obvious yet nobody ever seems to mention it.
---
Yes. Without any doubt.
---
You‚Äôre mean
---
Panic is kind of irritating but honestly if changes to resource availability were made in the right way it wouldn't be as major an issue as people make it out to be.
---
Red loot is just the databases, they sell to NPC buy orders like wormhole blue loot. Those are really the only thing that get tripled.
---
I believe T3 is the first tier where the small disintegrator specialization skillbook starts to drop but it's rare as fuck, I've looked at some spreadsheets people more devoted to tracking loot than myself have made and I've yet to see any evidence of that particular book dropping below T3.
---
lmao current year raids being hard. mate please.
---
That misses the point entirely.
---
I keep trying to rotate the camera and end up pausing the video.
---
Wish we could broadcast the full 3d environment.
---
&gt;If CCP doesn't improve noob retention
---
Don't give them ideas, they tried once, it was called injectors
---
cant run c5 sites duo, is shit for smartbombing, cant be used to refit.... i guess you get it.
---
if it was just a bait, well.. you got me
---
Genuinely it's actually made our mining corpmates get into fleets together when in any other case they would be doing everything solo.
---
What do you think long means? It'd take fresh-start skill farms 4+ months to be turning out extractors, and not every tom  dick and harry would have isk and supply of +5s to get them running efficiently. How many people gonna unload rl money on enough extractors to handle the farms? Will people gamble on buying them on an unstable, immature market where prices vary wildly and everything is rushed? What percentile of hardcoreness will you need to be able to afford to buy injectors when there is only a brand new source of farms as opposed to a decade+ of old characters sitting around waiting to be extracted? Don't forget current condition in eve is build on 15 years of resource harvesting outpa inf destruction, including the years where peak online was over 60,000 and the times of not-yet-nerfed excavators, etc. T2 prices? Hahahahaha.
---
I'd guess a reset of new Eden with current mechanics would take 3-5 years to come remotely close to what it is now. And it still wouldn't actually be close, it'd just look like it at a cursory inspection.
---
Oh so you've completed 10/10 mythic every raid every expansion? You're cutting edge huh?
---
Any video content of a fight or a fitting rundown or some kind of tutorial is better than the constant moaning and groaning walls of text in this sub.
---
Long walk around the hanger and station bars in 10% TiDi
---
No we did not agree, read through my response:
---
1) Black out is causing human prey to drop - this is bad
---
2) Unquantified opinions and subjective levels of what is incompetence is like having any other opinion - and this we can completely agree - opinions not based on data and facts are like arm pits, everyone has one. It still does not remove my point #1.
---
3) "Periodic" blackouts allow more risk versus less because more human prey feel safe
---
where have i ever said this is for pipebombs? 
---
dude cmon. you cant be that retarded. sb nestors alone are widely used in lowsec or wormhole brawls.
---
and on top of that they are quite good in many other different situations as mentioned above. and all that in a SINLE hull.
---
Reread what he said about triple 40m/hour in regards to me talking about subcaps you smoothbrain
---
A few.  And no i couldn‚Äôt stick to the same subcaps because i‚Äôm not retarded
---
Imagine if a lot of that nullsec wealth had to be gated through lowsec to be converted on the market. NS convoys, LS pirates. Logistic operations didn't mean a couple cyno alts. This is how WH life was, scouts on every hole between here and k-space. Even the rats didn't have bounties, someone has to haul that blue loot out every so often.
---
Soo  where is all the people that you said they were subbing all theyr accounts becuse the blackout was going to be amazing!!?  becuse right know eve has 16,000 accounts loged  even jita dosnt have 1k in local.
---
Now CCP is on a lose/lose side, they wanted to try new things but as they didnt put an end date on those change. they losing player fast and no there is no point on return, why people will come back even if they roll back all, who will trust in a company that can change everything in the game just becuse they want and destroy all what you have worked for.
---
That's how WoW classic is going to end up. 
---
My post got taken down...WTF
---
checking zkill to find sb nestors, and i got bored after 6 pages of none.
---
so you know what.  fk it.  no buff to nestor.  let it rot.   since you apparently use it and its so good in that role. maybe we should go for a nerf.  seems to be what your implying
---
I liked the old system. Not sure I remember it fully, but there used to be a "most wanted" list. It should be simple. If you have a bounty and you're online, you show up on the bounty list. You can filter the targets by price, region, and sec status. 
---
Let players choose who they want to kill, they pay a fee, and get 2 hrs of pings every 15 minutes as to where their target is.
---
 
---
The player assumes the risk of attacking in high sec if they choose a player that's not a criminal.
---
To be clear, when I said 'rest of the game', I'm referring specifically to the PVE parts, and I think Abyssals are relatively well balanced forms of pve, both in terms of risk as well as reward. The risks are significant enough that they can never be fully mitigated, and the rewards are significant enough that it makes it feel like it's worth it. Of course other players don't flock to them, because there is other PVE content that provides the same sorts of rewards with completely mitigatable risk.
---
its a dps check man. fucking addons dont even have to tell you what to do, the game does it for you, while you faceroll for lootbox purps.
---
That‚Äôs one of the most retarded things I‚Äôve ever read.
---
Look at those timestamps. Must have been a bot.
---
Yeah and people here are judging wow and saying how much better eve is. Well the numbers don‚Äôt say so. Someone even mentioned making an eve classic like wow. üòÇ
---
So clearly you have literally 0 idea what you are talking about. So I'm going to take my leave and let you bury yourself in that.
---
Actually i wish i could feel what i did when i started something over decade ago. Dont rush anywhere, the longer you play eve, the more boredom you encounter. At some point the game becomes serious business followed by boredom. Broken game, which, needless to say was broken by players and players only, those very same "older" players who are shitting up reddit with "its broken". Eve is complicated.
---
turn off prop mod when you align back. easy way not to overshoot your turn
---
k enjoy retail
---
I will. Enjoy vanilla.
---
i will :)^^^once ^^^i ^^^get ^^^past ^^^the ^^^fucking ^^^queues ^^^lmao
---
That retention has to do with how fucking tedious the game is. I feel so fucking limited with one character. I could never go back to playing the game with one because oh I wanna go roam. Oh wait I wanna make money you either sit there all day doing nothing and making isk or actually play the game. New players don‚Äôt know how make isk or play the game. The game is so fucking tedious to play as a new player. 
---
Not to mention the skill training. Like yes I get it it kind of makes sense. But now that game has been out for so long. I think skill injectors are good or at least skill points as rewards cuz wtf. 
---
You think this new player is gonna log in and look at the ships and see ohh I wanna fly that. Oh wait that says 142 days. Not to mention extra modules and guns and say ‚Äú oh my gosh this is so exciting I cannot wait fly that in have a year‚Äù it‚Äôs fucking stupid. What other game timegates shit that bad. 
---
Look at the more popular games. Players do content as fast as they wanna do it. I think skill training will always be a bane for getting new players to play and all the tediousness and how ducking boring it is to actually try to make decent money in the game. Especially on one account.
---
Very simple words. The isk generated by NS ratting is too high, losses are too low. More risk in NS will decrease your income.
---
The guy is an idiot who belive in his imagination that this changes are good and healthy for the game lool. 
---
And every day less and less people are login on eve.
---
- Risk is a human function, which is why my statement stands. Why do you want mechanical changes if you can create risk via human functions?
---
- I've checked the post blackout MER. 
---
- How much risk should be mitigated by effort, how much effort should be REMOVED to apply risk?  You're so focused on the latter, don't pretend to give a fuck about the former.
---
- No. You're literally a psychopath who doesn't listen or comprehend anything beyond your circlejerk of "NULL IS BAD BECAUSE FUCK SAFETY" without even knowing what safety means.  Balance between playstyles shouldn't be a krab farming for 1000 hours to be able to compete with your 5 minute jita shopping spree.  Balance shouldn't be years of building up to lose to someone who thinks cloaking is the only viable strategy to hunt.  Balance shouldn't be someone spending 1000 mining hours ona a ship that you think should be nerfed because "some people are too poor to afford supers" and no other rationality.  Your ENTIRE stance is based on a megalomaniac perspective of koolaid chugging circlejerks for zkill stats and nothing else, and you KNOW it's true just by this comment sequence alone. 
---
If you TRULY give a fuck about balance, find ways to force more pvp... and less ways to butcher pve defense.  Kill more supers.  FORCE more titans to die.
---
Quit pretending that you want balance until you push for change that'll help the game, not stagnate null even worse for your hunting pleasure.
---
What happened here?
---
Honestly, just play the game and ignore this subreddit. I don't think I've seen another sub with so much vitriol, entitlement, and toxicity as this one has on a daily basis. I genuinely love EVE, and some of the shit I've heard people say about it on this sub is just embarrassing. They want new players to try it out, but at the same time post nothing but doom and gloom... For what? All this does is drive away the newly initiated players. If you ignore the drivel on this sub, you can actually enjoy the game.
---
Fuck waiting 300 days before I can fly a ship. Skill injectors are good.
---
These are old, and probably shouldn't be used by themselves, but I found them helpful a couple years ago.
---
https://forum.eveuniversity.org/viewtopic.php?f=262&amp;t=84659
---
Skill training isn‚Äôt ‚Äúskill‚Äù it‚Äôs timegated content.
---
I remember when I tried EVE for the first time shortly after Retribution came out, and the login menu theme was [so good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpSgjxeDW_w), I sometimes just sat there and listened to it instead of playing.
---
because big lowsec/wormhole brawls dont happen on a daily basis. (and no, just because they dont happen that often, doesnt mean a ship is bad or is shit at its role)
---
you are basically spitting out shit to someone that asks for something while absolutely not knowing for what a ship gets used/can be used and on top of that apparently not knowing how gamemechanics work.
---
You probably make of people who make meme fits for fun cuz you‚Äôre so superior.
---
The game would fucking die.
---
Black-op Nestor, can bridge/jump Astero/Strat to systems 2 or 3 jumps away through wormhole connected systems.
---
Probably a bad idea but it‚Äôs fun to think about.
---
my guess is they are winding down the alliance. they've barely been active. [https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99007044/](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99007044/)
---
What alliance are you in? You should talk to your current FCs.
---
Some are like PH where anyone can ping and form for a fleet and we have a bunch of docurins they can use. Others will have some rules, such as asking permission and set doctrines only new FCs can fly. Just talk to your alliance as they most likely have some doctrines that everyone already owns or is seeded for new FCs.
---
I would also include destroyers as well, talwars are great for new FC whelps. If you are in a large corp and can get more then 10 dudes corms are awesome for teaching fleet warping a positioning.
---
bots apparently dont like to login when local is gone...
---
Just use keep at range ?
---
It‚Äôs great that it took WoW classic coming back to get Hilmar to give a shit about EVE.

But my nostalgia!!! Make game good again, game bad now!!!

These are some of my favorites. They aren't WiNGSPAN. I like the WiNGSPAN one too.

Just wanted to add a couple for you to check out.
---
never mentioned brawls.
---
my point was that there are alternatives to it in all roles,  that are either better or better in terms of cost.
---
and my request was that since it has a bonus to large energy turret range, it be given the powergrid to use those as a viable option. as right now the low powergrid gimps it from using them in a good fit.
---
your the one who claimed it was THAT good.  and apparently, according to you, the best in all those fields.   so i guess we need a nerf?
---
maybe make up your mind?
---
wut?
---
I remember when I hated myself enough to hurt others. Be positive towards others and you will start to like yourself.
---
&gt; Like it was stated before. If you had 100 titan pilots in eve and you bought one ... it was still 100 titan pilots in eve.
---
Titan pilots are not a constant. Skill farming existed long before skill injectors. Before skill injectors training capital and titan pilots for sale was an income source. The only difference is the initial investment and time scale to create them. There were always new titan pilots being created the game and titan pilots quitting and selling their characters. So your notion that they were somehow a limited resource is utterly and hilariously wrong.

I agree that skill farms suck and that it is the big problem brought on by injectors. We've seen similar things before where plex prices spike when some new source of income arises where it can pay for an account and scale across many accounts. I don't have a good solution though and I think the benefits outweigh the negatives.
---
&gt; For example if you want to inject 2mil sp in cruisers ... you need 2mil SP in injectors, but if you want to inject stuff like capitals, jump skills ... or rorquals. To get this 2mil sp you need to have from 16 to 20mil SP in injectors.
---
This is already built into the system. Each skill has a multiplier, the harder skills require more SP. Adding an additional multiplier is unnecessary.
---
Skill injectors have made the game a much more egalitarian place. The past balance decisions which relied on rarity of capitals and supercapitals were proven to be a mistake long before skill injectors were a thing. The solution is to balance the capital and supercapital ships the way they should have been long ago, as if they are ubiquitous ships that everyone who wants one will eventually own. I still don't understand how the last supercarrier/titan rebalance went through. In dominion sov we saw the rise of subcap murdering supercarriers and tracking titans blapping interceptors. These were so wildly broken and bad for the game even when titans and supercarriers were kind of uncommon. They were fixed.  Then a couple years later with supercapital proliferation still out of control someone decided to bring it all back with HAWs and improved supercarrier fighters. For the record I argued against this on the CSM.

You have no idea how many unused systems there are in eve. So no if your region or area is getting depleted that in no way means the next area is getting depleted.
---
&gt;Hell, i live in a wormhole but dive into null to run your DED's/Unrated combat sites because you guys never do them and are easy to secure
---
Dude, stop it.  I live in a c2 c5/null.  This is how I make isk too.  We don't want them running the sites do we?
---
w max everything i can think of in pyfa 128 is max in red giant btw, also 48km scram
---
Poor Frosty, RIP - FFF but umm dude thats a terrible attempt at bumping someone ... poor show
---
you know skillfarms are omega clone only? :) alpha accounts should have access to that app asap.
---
No, you will go a different way.
---
Don't worry the math checks out. Goons lost like 25 titans on their first journey up to the north in the first battle. They claim to be able to mine that in a week? So we have had 1 battle over 2 years that took 1 week to refill. That's so thats like 100 times more minerals currently being mined than it takes to defend them. That's absurd. Your point is clearly lacking in context or rational. They can absolutely crush mining by over half and still have and insane level of replenishment available.
---
Eve second Genesis was that high  
---
that's definitely not the case anymore though
---
i said ''used for smartbombs in fleets''  which is exactly what theyre used for. otherwise i would have said PIPEBOMBS like everyone else calls them.
---
but once again, completely ignoring that just shows off that you apparently dont have a clue about this. which questions why you are even talking/judging about it. just playing around in eft or looking at something else than null blobwarfare might help...
---
and i never said its the best in all those field (AYYY once again talking out of your ass). i said its good in many different roles. good doesnt mean BEST. all these DIFFERENT roles while beeing a SINGLE hull.

Caps are being more and more marginalized each update. What's wrong being stuck in subcaps

The argument isn't about moving the anomalies to the next system it's about SPREADING them. My focus is large asteroid mining operations. Colossus or enormous fields should be 1 per region. You should have to TRAVEL to get to them. Possibly multiple jumps. If it pops up it's desired. Not just goes to the next system. The value of the anomaly should increase the scarcity. Anyone thinking this argument is about moving anomalies over a system is so sadly mistaken.
---
Its ok, they're too busy making troll alts and crying on their keyboards to make reddit posts to run those sites.
---
The guy that responded earlier has a good point but simply put, just like other valuables that can be found, tier it out, you get better and different minerals and loot in each respective security space. Have different LVL of agent based on SP of bounty Characters. High sec for lower SP, etc. I‚Äôm just spitballing here but I think this would at least be much better than the current system. Hell even adding a module that allows to just scan a capsule after ship destruction to collect the bounty would be better than the current system.
---
Longbow Corms, Trashers &amp; Assault Frigates are all great to learn how to FC in if you‚Äôre doing a traditional ‚Äúanchor up‚Äù type of fleet as opposed to a small or micro gang where your fleet is typically manually piloting their own ships. Get into something with combat probes though as soon as you can and practice using them.
---
&gt; Maybe it's because Vegas isn't really a family town, so it wasn't including that demographic, and that's where they're spreading the love to? That could make sense, San Diego is way more family friendly.
---
Speaking solely for myself here, I'm far more likely to attend the NA EVE event for exactly that reason. Vegas is a smokey, neon hell-hole in the desert; it's not really all that pleasant of a place to go. San Diego offers a lot to do that doesn't involve drinking, and it's a much calmer place overall.
---
Overpriced.
---
I know a guy that will hit the strip club when the late shift hits. Like 3-5am. Get a couple drinks for the girls and they will go back to his room for a decent rate.
---
Why would that miss the point? The issue with the Rorq is scalability.
---
Thats true. And lots of stuff are still tedious as fk.
---
Bot made a pvp alliance http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Reckless_Contingency.

Im selling a nag pilot.

I wish we could choose the music on login screen (or even in game). Those tracks are too good not to be used.
---
I'm with you, I installed a bidet on my toilet and my life has forever changed.
---
I love dummies who think Goons are going to turn into a nomadic hunter gathering group like the PL OG days. LOL if you've ever been in goons for a month you'll see how lazy casuals those people are. They don't even want to move thier supers to the North and fight for a extended period. Let alone do what you claim they will... Roam from region to region moving everything over and over again like some elite group of PvPers. Please. 
---
Sure you'll have a select few who are on board but then goons loose the only thing they have in this game which is numbers.
---
I agree, and we do regular LA meetups.
---
There is a certain kind of debauchery that can happen in vegas 24/7 that can't be had anywhere else.
---
Didnt pibc  lose  few too
---
Make is cloaky in line with the rest of the ships.
---
Rest in Peace in Piss
---
I don't mind the blackout. It's the cyno changes that I don't like.
---
I expected this hasn't had an effect on you. I was asking the guys who whine because I suspect most of them haven't even tried to continue life as normal yet they gripe as if they lost a dozen ships a day.
---
Uhm not to be a killjoy but you expect kills from a farming alliance?
---
&gt; Coming up with a timer system that works for both groups is tough. Same with asset safety changes.
---
How about: scale timers inversely with alliance assets.
---
If that's too abusable: scale timers inversely with blue assets.
---
Since that's still kind of abusable, assuming it doesn't already work this way: make citadels open to any neutrals automatically open to all neutrals, and make citadels open to blues only open to mutual blues.  Or maybe just make 2 options: citadels open to everyone or only open to mutual blues.
---
Then huge alliances would have short timers, couldn't hide assets without losing access to them or giving everyone access to them, and can't specify "friendly neutrals" to pretend like they have fewer assets than they have.  Spread out too much and you have multiple factors making it harder to defend your sprawl of space.
---
Hello, I just rejoined the game and I moved into a C3 wormhole. I'm having difficulty coming up with a fit to run solo c3 combat sites (living in a pulsar). I can fly most battleships, I can fly a rattlesnake with t1/meta 4 guns and working for t2, and I can fly the loki perfectly which I use for pvp. Any help is most appreciated. ty
---
Nope.
---
I think the key to bounty hunting is only making criminal targets available to hunt. Once you have a bounty and a low security status, you get put into a pool where all your data is collected. People can sort the pool of targets by their most active regions, peak activity times, and price of bounty. When you ask for a target, you get an unknown bounty made available to you for 1 week.
---
During this week you get constant updates as to where your target is, whether docked or in space, and what ship they are in. When you enter the system you are able to warp to them at any time whether they are cloaked or not. When you are in a system with your target CONCORD denies them the ability to dock, jump gates, or cyno out. If they log off, they'll stay in space for 30 mins. 
---
You need to kill their ship and pod to collect the bounty. Their pods are warp disabled upon ship destruction or ejecting when you are on grid with them. 
---
This scenario definitely favors the bounty hunter, but it's time for criminals to have extreme consequences for their extreme actions.
---
The "compromise" would be a "Forests and Farms" design. Where you differentiated between local "wild life" for hunter gathering with astra(huts), and local civilized space with Farms and Keeps. The design of such a see saw (negative feedback) system would be fairly simple, but require a lot of bottom up redesign philosophy to get working. My suggestion is that CCP should start trusting the "simulation" and design more along the lines of real world economies and ecosystems, that would be a lot more intutive for new players to understand and it would bring the incentives and geopolitics known from real world history.
---
&gt;A few. And no i couldn‚Äôt stick to the same subcaps because i‚Äôm not retarded
---
See, you don't have much basis to decide  the blackout will have a large effect on your playstyle. Honestly, I suggest you try going business as usual and see. As long as you're being reasonably smart, you should do OK isk-wise.
---
I've lost a little off the top. About 10% reduction due to ship loss. That's entirely acceptable given the fact null is SUPPOSED to be dangerous.
---
&gt; Problem is those battles are the ones that get media attention, and so attract the new players CCP desperately needs. You killing a ratting ship doesn't.
---
Almost none of the new players that CCP desperately needs don't stay around when they realize how hard it is to train into and afford a cruiser, short of a handout, let alone get into the pretty titans and supers they see in videos... when they find out what tidi is... when they find out what grinding anoms or rocks is... etc.
---
And I don't kill ratters.
---
if only we could inject that to 5... but then I'd be playing one night stands instead...
---
There is no way local would ever serve another purpose than intel man. I mean its literal information. No dude, these were not loopholes. Im not saying its cool to drop caps on everything but its not cheating.
---
Heres where we disagree. Plus the rorq is already heavily nerfed but the issue with rorq has always been scalability. The day I see them fix that is the day I put an endtimer on how long it actually took them to fix it.
---
Honestly, when was NS this hardcore endgame content area? Cause granted I havent played from the beginning but its not been that since I started playing and its a while now. And things change my man, this is where nostalgia comes into play. Instead of trying to break something that organically became a part of the sandbox we want to mechanically break. If people want NS to be an isk farm let it, but make sure we get new content to cover the loss.
---
The issue here man is that youre missing some key aspects. The blackout isnt needed for the economy, CCP Rise said so himself, it will stay if enough people like it. Botting I doubt is down, in fact I think its gone up massively because their margins got buffed due to PLEX falling. Think about it, you used to get 2b for 20 USD, not you get what, like 1,6 or so? Thats a massive buff for a botter. They didnt leave the game man, they just moved. Blackout was the best thing to happen to bots in years, not against them as people think. They got their margins buffed plus now they are sitting invincible in HS.
---
Cyno change will only bring stagnation. And also, you have to realise that isk has to be made right? CCP Rise said the current levels are not sustainable. It dropped way too much and you can see its ripple effects on the market, inflation. You think the economy got healthier but it really really didnt.
---
So if you did have as many people as us, how would you convince the rest of them to stay home?
---
I will be honest, I used to buy injectors. I don't buy them anymore since I passed 50 million SP. I would be honest in saying I used to be a whale, but I stopped buying them completely. 
---
I personally would buy accelerators if I could, but I won't buy injectors anymore as their value is to low for me personally. I would argue that the older a character gets in EVE the less monetized they become because of this. If you're purely looking at it from a making money perspective I would argue that this incentives more monetization over a prolonged period of time while also serving some of the community frustrations and concerns.
---
I think cyno jammers should be fucking deleted.
---
If you disagree, you're a fucking moron.
---
I have no fucking clue what that is, but this is an old post.
---
Except with periodic blackout people will simply not go out during that time.
---
Permanent black out they'll learn to go out anyway.
---
People want to, but we need a reason to fight.
---
Just play - the nuances of the game are amazing. You will never be the best at everything - find your niche.
---
Idk where you got that from what I said. You roll mods, use the decent ones (+50-+75%) and sell everything else. You'll spend some isk, but not as much as people think, and get a dank mod.
---
Only thing I was trying to say is that it's not like the ones that don't become what you're looking for lose all their value.
---
And you are not saying anything relevant.
---
ok so lets make it simple then.
---
since it has a large energy turret bonus to range.   would it be a good thing to buff its powergrid so it can realistically fit large energy turrets on a non meme fit.
---
or not.
---
answer.
---
Are you even reading it?
---
well they have 70,000 kills and 17t destroyed, it's not like they didn't pvp
---
neocom II for ios.
---
Ask any bumper, any real bumper. 
---
They will tell you manual piloting is the only way to bump.
---
risk averse like you are. the new hunting meta is 0 effort with possible gains. its a joke and spit on the effort of us hunters before blackout. you cried like a little girl which is jealous the other girls lollipop is pink. you have your little fanbase you can cater to them but your pseudo logical arguments are just a joke.   
---
you point fingers to goons, test, panfam and all others you know what point a finger mr wannabe pvp player three fingers point back at you, and since i point now at you yes i know i point at me also. I DONT DO PVE, since 2009. I would do pve if it where anything engaging. All your changes and your little pseudo logic which is nothing else then self proclaiming won't help eve to survive. Where is your rout your fanbase to get ccp to INVEST MONEY IN THE GAME with more than 4 devs. Thats the facts your crying is about to hide. 
---
CCP neglected the game for years and still does, some morale speeches some hints for stuff that never comes, and now they alienate some players which will have a pull effect on other players. Do you think that eve will recover? NO IT WON'T. You know what eve needs, thats INVENTION and INVESTMENT. That fucking means rework of a lot of stuff and that had to be done years ago but they did a shit. They invested your cash, mine cash and other cash for sideprojects which failed. Now they invest in the mobile market, not for eve for other games and stuff. 
---
Do you see T3 Cruisers, BC, BS? Do you see real selfmade Jumpgates like to connect "EXAMPLE" a not connected system to a system like you could connect J space system with each other? Do you see any real Balance changes which they said they will do in short amounts of time to each other ? They just nerfed and didnt change cruisers, battleships etc. The last big balance change was with frigates and thats also years ago. Do you see the reworked UI? Catering to new players? New Content? Build up on lore? Rework for lowsec and Faction Warfare? I don't see any investment any real non wannabe marketing hints, i don't see a devblog. All i see is some brambling from Hilmar and some nerfs to Nullsec cause of ISK wealth and Inflation.    
---
But here you are a voted CSM with bad ideas defending even worse ideas instead of creating ideas in which CCP has to invest and which are a REWORK not a nerf like a wannabe would do.
---
No it wasnt dude. 
---
Which is what not being hardcore means. Casual is casual.
---
The biggest wall for me was learning the UI you never get how complicated it is just through tutorial videos, as for the p2w the subscription is kinda necessary to have fun beyond just trying the game out but it's relatively cheap and you can quit anytime. My suggestion is to look at as many tutorials as you can and join a newbie friendly Corp ie. Horde/karmafleet when you generally get an idea how the game works out. If you have any questions you can ask, the community is very good about that kinda stuff.
---
Lots of mids and lows, and has a 15m drone bay
---
No, it's with Rorqual mobility. That's the whole reason scarcity would be ineffective without addressing either mobility or its ability to mine.
---
Oh ye. But its fozzie sov and it wont really serve any good. U need to do it to get rid of those awful cyno jammers tho.
---
No but if it happens you can def pounce. It will become harder to do so. The big fights use capital hard cynos and even those die, a recon wont survive.
---
As others said, it'd need to be associated with a total refresh of the game mechanics as well - and perhaps not even then. The communities of Eve have solidified, and resetting the game would not undo 16 years of social evolution and congealing of superblocs from the primordial soup of early-Eve. If anything, it would make that *worse* - as now the *only* advantage anyone would have between each other would be "who can muster more members".
---
&gt; That's never the case and will not be the case and SHOULD NOT be the case
---
Except in Eve, where it's always been the case, and where it is intended by the people who are literally in charge.
---
You're trying to argue with the sun that it shouldn't be bright, then getting mad at it when it doesn't dim itself because you said its existence is a fallacy.
---
It started to go really bad after citadels/carrier changes which were in 2016? Iirc. So 3 years ago. 
---
Yes there were nerfs, but still.. the isk and ore pumped into the game after that is absurd.
---
Since supers are the best at basically everything. And the group with more supers win, the maingoal for bigger groups would be to achieve exactly that..
---
Id say it would take around  2.5-3 years to basically get to the same "oppressive" lvl (not same amount of supers) as we have now. With less players in the sandbox and the same citadel aids noone really likes. 
---
I would definetly not want to start again with these prospects...
---
Hi MrSunBro,
---
It's not that bad, really. It's a deep game with lots to learn, but you don't need to learn it all son, or at all really. I still don't know how mining or industry (building ships and modules) work after all these years. 
---
It really helps to have a group to play with. In EVE they are called Corporations, but they're the same idea as guilds in other games.  A good corp will help you learn the game and keep from being lonely and frustrated. 
---
There are several new-player corps you could look at: Eve University has been around for ages, and they run actual classes in game. Dreddit is a big Reddit-based corp that has mentorship programs and new player fleets. I'm in Dreddit so of course I recommend it! Pandemic Horde are our enemies, but they are another popular choice. Brand New Bros are in the same alliance as Dreddit (alliances are groups of corporations) and I highly recommend them too. Karmafleet is the newbie arm of Goonswarm, one of the biggest and most famous groups on the game. 
---
I don't think pay to win is the right term. I don't like to spend my game time making money, so I don't. I trade real money for ISK. That doesn't give me any advantage other than enjoying my time. It's possible to buy your way into skills by using Skill Points Injectors, but being able to fly a ship is very different from flying a ship WELL. 
---
Part of the player base is upset about recent changes, but there always a grumpy bunch of nerds when ANYTHING changes. I wouldn't worry about it. 
---
If you want to come say hi on the [Dreddit Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/eeCX7ch) I'm Claytonius3. In game too. Feel free to ask me any questions you've got, 
---
Oh, and if you're going to start, make sure you get a referral link from am active player. They will get some in game money, and it's customary to kick some of it back to you. I think you get extra skill Points too but I'm not certain. 
---
Fly safe!
---
Ya to humble brag a bit.  My favorite afk was bumping a vexor and killing it with an arty slasher xD 
---
Is fun but ya definitely need to be a bit more careful on the line up when the ship is smaller. Good kill!
---
 tbh, killing pve player (ships) is like gank miner in highsec. it shows only that you WH pvp cant face real pvp.
---
The issue with the rorq has always been scalability. You do realise that at some point you need to stop with nerfs to the economy right? I think a lot of people have somehow gotten the idea that CCP wants PvE gone from NS but they dont because that will break the economy and the game. The Rorq even needs buffs atm and imo they should get buffed atleast 200% but a limit on how many you can use. This could be down with higher APM or just force people to use subs.
---
Yeah there‚Äôs a learning curve. But with free to play you get to get your feet wet without any commitment.
---
But doo all the tutorial missions! I think their are 12 career agents aka tutorials regarding various areas of the game.
---
There‚Äôs plenty of large groups out there to join and they all like helping you out learning the game.
---
I recommend sitting in the recruiting channel for a bit and talking to several recruiters. 
---
If I mention any other alliance other than test in this sub, their bots will downvote me into oblivion but some of the best gameplay is with small groups.
---
You do realize at a point fairly recently in the game's history, Rorquals could not mine and the economy was just fine, right?
---
&gt; The Rorq even needs buffs atm  
---
[Passive and Active Rattlesnake](https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/message/6798038/) 
---
There you go, obviously adjust for skills.  I do a passive Rattle in C3‚Äôs, just started a few weeks ago, and it honestly is a breeze...just watch out for other folks buy you already knew that! :)
---
Sure, thats why all the marketing campaigns are about HS miners and LS pirates right?
---
Megabattles are numbers. We dont break players in the same fight records by less. Its been a while since we had any 4k fights hasnt it?
---
No, its your assumption that its good. But you are missing the other side here. You somehow think the nerfs to the economy is good but even CCP Rise said they have to start buffing it cause its a long term issue if it stays low. I think way too many underestimate the effects this had and all of the sudden think this is all nerf PvE. You need that in the game, whether you like it or not. And you need it in NS. 
---
The blackout is ruining the economy, not fixing it. Anyone with any real knowledge about economy will tell you that.
---
I agree that panic mode is a shit thing to begin with, also you did effort hunt. The response fleet is also a good thing for the rorqual player nothing wrong with it. I only play the PVP part in this game since i don't like non hardcore endgame pve.
---
but you are totally different than olmeca is, he wants to have 5 people in nano kill supers and dare the defender's to show up.
---
next question is why you didnt bring a dread bomb or a supercapital fleet? Easy you know you would lose it probably vs their response. So why should the defender's not outform you?
---
Nail on the head. It's not nullsec, highsec, or lowsec players fault how things are. It is in CCP's lap and their failure to adjust over the years to the changing play style of games, and now they seem to want to double down on "make it harder". Even in the fantasy/themepark mmo, there have been a few shots at the "lets make a hardcore MMO cause it will draw in the REAL PLAYERS" - remember Wildstar ? That game was a bomb and doubled down on the hardcore only crowd. CCP needs to get its collective head out of the sand, look around at reality, and swallow a bitter pill. If they don't, the employees better brush up their resumes for the job market.
---
If the economy was just fine, why did the Rorq get introduced?
---
My man, you dont know the ship. Its fking obvious to me by now.
---
Honestly, it‚Äôs a great way to learn combat game mechanics, especially for new players... or to get down votes on Reddit.
---
Give me back my jukebox!
---
Player Owned Stations, or POS‚Äôs, can and usually do have automated defenses.   It‚Äôs that especially in a frigate it takes a while to lock you and in your overview will have a yellow (?) blink thing around it informing you that it is in the process of locking you.
---
No sound?  Couldn't imagine.  Wormholer btw
---
Recycle them and it won't be a total loss.
---
Yes the ceo who came back from failing other games to suddenly decide the thing he had no clue what has gone on in needed his ‚Äúguidance‚Äù
---
I really like the price, I just cant use the t2 cruise launcher
---
... For what?
---
You can reprocess
---
‚ÄúFeed to me or shut up‚Äù
---
No fuck off
---
Wait what? Are you just saying no randomly? The PCU has dropped like a rock even through login events, thats significant. CCP said divisive, Falcons word and the conclusion is supported by the very fact that CCP Rise even talked about unsubs. 
---
The MER is literally data from CCP and it says there is less activity going on.
---
I mean dude, wtf are you even saying. Get your head out of your ass.
---
Completely ignoring that you could prob get some ridiculous op fits out of it with more pg.
---
The nestor is good im many different roles. Many more than other standard subcaps. It doesnt need another role to fill or a buff in general to get used. And just because a ship has a bonus, doesnt always mean it has to be used that way or it is a good idea to use it for that. Hinting at that scanner probe streanght on the nestor you might have seen...
---
Its just a lot easier. The cyno fleets in blocs make life hell of lot easier. And if you go on fleets then its just easier for one to light than 10.
---
I mean I agree, an extra account is preferable but it wasnt needed.
---
Because they felt it was useless. Which it wasn't, but CCP made the mistake of listening to players who don't understand anything about the game.  
---
Why are you having a meltdown right now?
---
A few battleships could use slight buffs, the Nestor isn't one of them though.
---
OMG I miss potbs so bad.
---
Dude, I actually resubbed because of the changes. I do agree the cyno changes are bit heavy handed but in the right direction. I think if they opened up cynos to a few more specialized ships the changes would be a bit more appropriate.
---
Yeah man.. me too. Now we've just had the same one for years.. and I hate it.
---
What we are seeing(and will continue to see) is a massive drop off in players due to changes by CCP that a huge chunk of the playerbase expressed a dislike for and warned that there would be consequences. And, surprise people left because of it,  all the tactics employed by CCP to make it look like everything is fine are finally played out and the player base is dropping like a rock. You can thank all of the TOXIC people of this sub(mods especially) that helped effect these changes and then berated and harrassed anyone who disagree on this sub when they expressed frustration. Everyone wants balance, and content, but you cant have the yin without the yang.
---
What do you think the screenshot is ya numpty :P
---
Too hard for most people. I remember how quick and hard goons failed and left.
---
surprisingly, theres ways to add pg without those other fits.
---
its called a bonus reducing powergrid for specific modules.    
---
and if it doesnt need another role, might as well drop the bonus.  reason being(unlike the scanner probe), is you can't really equip the large lasers and have a fit that isnt meme or gimped in some way.  so the bonus is like having a stealth bomber with a bonus to torpedos, but it can only equip 1 torpedo launcher due to pg restrictions.
---
nestor can do scanner probe,  and it doesnt gimp the fit.    its not advised to use it for that role true.  but it can with the fitting.
---
Hilmar probably just wants to fuck off to the beach to tan, I can't imagine why they would pick San Diego. EVE Down Under already generates a ton of apac interest, San Diego is a poor choice to appeal to that market.
---
Again pseudo arguments. There where already rorqus, supers and carriers dying in goonspace, test space and pandafam space before blackout. CAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO KILLED IT PUT THE RIGHT EFFORT IN TO KILL IT.
---
you don't ask for balance you ask for assymetrical changes, you get free intel via map and dotlan which system has x amounts of npc kills. so information a really huge tool for any kind of warfare goes to attackers. You have different kind of smallstuff and wormholes so defenders can't defend static they have to defend with responses. They have tools for to response and do so. You could now since you know as attacker how the response will look gather the numbers and the right composition of needed ships to attack those responses like snuff does. NOPE you opt for nerf nerf nerf nerf until your little nanogang can kill supers thats all you want. DO you really think this will help to improve balance or get new players? NO IT WON't it will just shift balance and people will adapt or leave. And the adapt part you see already DEADSPACE. So the only thing which is left to hunt are your favoured enemys the big blocks especially goons, those blocks who actually care for new players and cater to them of course for their own need. But do you even care for them? only as your killboard fodder as far as we all know.

Now you see your favoured enemys can outform and outclass you in every aspect of your personal pride to kill you while you don't get a kill you want. THATS why you try to bring your pseudo arguments, and they all point in one direction. YOU HATE GOONS, you want them to disband leave the game and you want to hurt them, you want also to hurt the other big blocks. And you know what`? that won't happen. Power Vacuum will be filled even if one of those blocks collaps. Someone else will fill the spot they will have the experience and the knowledge and setup the same thing under different balance circumstances and then you are again at the start of your hate campaign vs another one so your killboard gets green again with new changes you propose.

Best pvp ever in an MMO. Like, you could actually win a fight IN the fight by being good.

CCP choose not to listen to players who understand the game. You realise the CSM that was filled with NS people said it was a horrible direction right?
---
Its not a meltdown, its just be realising Im wasting my time with someone who doesnt know the facts. And I doubt you want to hear them based on what you already said.
---
Once you learn the mechanics and how the game works it‚Äôs honestly not that bad to grasp, but it‚Äôll take some patience don‚Äôt get me wrong.
---
Well worth it if you enjoy this kind of thing
---
Do the tutorial missions and the career agents. You can do all that free and you'll also get some good free starter ships and mods. GMs are now even checking in with new players and handing out free items.

I'd stay away from any corp in the beginning. It's best to shift through and fine tune what you like before having someone else tell you what to do. Eve players want you so bad, but then they seem to act like what they do is best for you.

when I was camping the north I noticed a lot of wermt krabs baiting for NC or wermt krabs on a NC moon with like one NC rorq too. I'm pretty sure a number of folks kept krab alts in WERMT and pvp pilots in NC for whatever reason. Given they're consolidating into one area it probably makes a lot less sense to force the krab/pvp split.

Players lost faith, because developers lost the original vision and focus on "quality" design.
---
That horde avatar at the end killing his own ally and fax alt. Never forget.
---
Yea, they could at least cycle them.

EvE always seemed like %99.9 metagame to me. You memorize 6 million things to where you can pick the right engagements.. then the vast majority of the time, once things are tackled the fight is over.

I disagree with all of this, I've found more prey during blackout that ever before. Now everyone doesn't dock up the instant I enter local. The salt factory that blackout has created is actually crazier than the change itself. Adapt or die nerd
---
Can confirm
---
I‚Äôve been playing this game for like 10 years
---
Had the most fun and learned the most when I started doing team pvp stuff... like 8 years in lmfao 
---
Love this game
---
We what now?
---
Trigs got pissed about cyno changes and unsubbed
---
So you say Hilmar.

+1

welcome to EVE

I didn't state the cost related to quality.  I do believe the cost relates to affordability.  Alpha is extremely limiting especially if you did go Omega for a short time.
---
I would not pay &gt;= $130 per year for a hobby; I would pay ~$60 per year for a hobby.
---
RIP the animated login screens. o7
---
for real though.... horrible bumping..... just bad...
---
Forgot about that.  I trained all my accounts to BC V as soon as the split skills were announced.    Training Precursor BC V now sucks.
---
Frigs move 0m/s now i forgot about that patch thanks
---
Training 5m sp is free as an alpha.
