Yeah, this. If you dont have boosts from something while mining you are generally wasting your time.

---
---
I wouldn't give CCP enough credit to read it accurately though tbh.
---
It‚Äôs so bright there
---
Almost 1 year to the day.
---
I'm all for criticism, and wanting improvements- But the spittle spraying moaning we've been subjected to by a few bitter ex players is nothing but "waaaah fuck this game". It does absolutely nothing. 
---

---
  Also just because reddit doesn't post about stuff- It doesn't mean it never happened. Stare at the zkill map for a while- Shit's happening. 
---
  If a capital dies and no one posts about it on reddit- Did it really happen?
---
Yeah, I realized I was probably preaching to the choir, but weird as it may be, the Reddit users, even the ones who disagree, at least offer somewhat intelligent counter-arguments sometimes. If I'm gonna write a wall o' bitch text, I want some feedback that's actually decent. 
---
Thanks, btw, for the feedback.
---
Oh really?  Most of r/eve cries bloody murder than pve players have that mindset and avoid being caught because of it
---
Cute
---
Only happens if you run minors in adjacent systems and above \o/
---
Ok i worded that badly. It's the "normal" new eden but it's basically like a new server or however you want to put it. So the backstory is the same, whether it will go the same direction from this point on is a question yet to be answered. 
---
  
---
The important part is that it has absolutely no crossover connection to the pc version. You can't take your character there or anything like that, everyone has to start from 0. Also the gameplay and some features are slightly altered, but overall it felt pretty eve-like for being on a phone.  
---
Some things that were only in the UI were slightly worrying regarding possible p2w though.
---
‚ÄúClearly not‚Äù /s

Ratting isnt terrible if he cam get to nullsec...rigjt ace ;)
---
You've played for less than 24 hours but you probably have an idea how difficult it is to get into. Getting discouraged is extremely common so vets and mentors tend to sugar coat the start of the game so you can get to experience the rest of it.
---
&gt; his prose is self-effacing and ever-so-tolerant placation, and it's obnoxious
---
/r/iamverysmart
---
Its really not. Making the kind of money to lose shit like loki's on the reg is pretty hard to do without any connections, no other accounts, no fuckery.
---
Ok.  Cool.  Your 4 day post history I'm guessing is your troll account.  You're also the most toxic person here, and you didn't deal with it for 3-10 years.   Lucky for you, Eve won't be here long enough for you to be a bitter vet.
---
They still have a sub?   Fuck, I loved that came pre-CU/NGE/whatever they called it when they fucked the whole game up.
---
Is this an ad?
---
Do they have color TVs and refrigerators?
---
People are going to be a little upset about not being about to play their E.O (EVE Online) capsuleer on E.E (EVE Echoes). Also the fact that the game isn‚Äôt being made by CCP AND is on a different servers might have something to do with it, but I don‚Äôt know. I just can‚Äôt wait for E.E to drop.
---
&gt;i think people can be upset at CCP consistently dropping the ball since then
---
What people like op don't realize is that people are still here because they still love Eve despite CCP mismanagement and neglect.
---
See I agree but the orca should be the combat ship on grid imo.. its current form is perfect for it.. albeit it needs a sensor buff.. but with the mining drones out I don't take advantage of the DPS bonus.. i feel it's at odds with itself.. it's the fleet booster/logi/DPS but it can mine as much as a hulk... Those don't mix IMHO.. one or the other not both. Either it's a command ship or it's a mining ship. If you need the mining drones to much there's no point to use them. If you take away it's DPS it loses some of its command benifits..  it's in a tough spot i feel it's being used for to many things..
---
Short list
---
1 fleet bonuses
---
2 DPS and login bonuses imply you don't need more than two or so on grid to save yourself having a dps toon.
---
3. it's a big ol miasmos for some people lol.
---
Then unintended is like fleet carrier and stuff.
---
And the rorq is just a bigger better orca. Shouldn't be able to mine as much as three hulks but it does. It's why capitals are everywhere.
---
Long story short the orca is a jack of all trades mining DPS and logi platform who's mining is a tad to strong.
---
Maybe custom kitchens or movies?
---
Dude... it's CCP. You seem to be under the delusion that the game is declining because people are mad about it. In reality, people are mad because the game is declining. At the end of the day, there's only one group of people responsible for the current state of the game, and it's CCP.
---
If EVE had any real competitors it would have imploded like a dying star years ago, but right now CCP is killing something truly unique through mismanagement and inaction. That's why people are upset.
---
As an aside, the game is probably more newbie friendly than ever, and we all love to see new people try the game out. But it's really cunty to just dismiss the opinions of decade-plus players as being just "toxic triggered vets" (lol) when they all remember a time when this game wasn't a raging dumpster fire. People aren't calling you out for being a newbie, they're calling you out for being a cunt.
---
Been posting here on and off since 2015, nothing changes. But this sub goes into "fuck CCP" phases every 6 months.

Ah yes, your brilliant point that everyone with a complaint about Eve should shut up and know their place. Very original and very intelligent, I *certainly* haven't heard it the past 14 years.
---
Well, you soon may get your wish; there won't be anyone complaining about Eve when no one's left playing it.
---
When I was really new/just getting back into eve I did a ton of junk collection in a magnet. Here is a video of me scooping left drones off a belt. https://youtu.be/ezkE4N_2jCU just have to kites the rats off with tacs. I could make about 10 million a hour roaming in null with combat probes.

No, you just have to cover a lot of ground, I just use a integrated scanner, T2 scope rig, a Blackglass implant and hack EVERYTHING.

I did ratting the various destroyer friendly anomalies and did level 1 security missions. Not great isk but pretty good for a beginner. Oh yeah and I mined in a venture for weeks. Don't do that.

I'm ex tribe. I flew Oracles once upon a time. I didn't realize D level low sec groups are flying Oracles in their nanogangs.

This is what I was going to say.  Used to use one for low sec cline trooper belt ratting.  It takes a bit of practice to get it going and you need to be super careful not to hit a rock, but once up to speed, nothing hits it.
---
while I do agree with point 1 and 2 , I strongly disagree on point 3
---
some history ... kinda rant but f\*\*\* it.
---
when I ~~ragequit~~ left Lineage 2 (hello to SP loss on death) back in 2006 I tried to find an MMO  without (so much) grind for "skills/loot"   , EVE was \*fresh\* in that regard, allowing to train passively (and ffs SPACESHIPS!). So I subscribed.
---
After few years first ~~dumb design~~ obstacle surfaced.  Clone replacement cost getting silly expensive (70M SP or so), and I didn't sunk enough time into game to fund this costs let alone ship replacement, so I stayed in High-Sec mostly as loosing pod was essentially going back to L2 days.  It took CCP f\*ing 8 YEARS to change this!
---
Now to main problem as I see in EVE is : multiboxing , for commercial POW it pure genius and moneygrab, from game play POW, its pure joke, nowadays we see oneman gank fleets as \*normal\*.Hello?How this shit even tolerated and \*normal\* let alone allowed? dual/triple boxing carriers?  PvP content? How is it \*fair\* (yeah its EVE i know) to be blown up not because of skill but because someone have paid 3x account? There no (in game) skill involved in fat wallet.
---
Enlighten me what other MMO is actively promote multiboxing.
---
It started as innocent "Power of two" in 2007 , then multi character training queue, and got worse from there.
---
Apotheosis came in the form of Skill Injectors, now its pure pay to win. And they money flowed and bots came ...
---
IMO  skill training is dumb mechanic in current day and form, its not 2004 any longer. Skills should be just removed entirely (this come from 150M+ char)  OR as a step measure  Magic 18  should be removed entirely and SP refunded.OR all item and skills requirements set to require Level 0 skills , and then improve from there.
---
This should unblock new players from being shat on by obscene training req to be competitive.
---
CCP should stop milking existing players for more money by stealthy tactic to require multiboxing to remain competitive. And put effort to making game more accessible to got more players on board.

My main career is Exploring. I got a shiny fast analyser ship and on really good days a sites can reach up to 200m, mostly about 70-100m, which is great but it becomes boring. My problem is everything else seems so pointless. I mine about 5m / half an hour. Aside from Industry with a huuge investment or much, much time put into station trading there doesn't seems to be anything as profitable. My question is, do the other careers, maybe with high skills, reach a point where it becomes as profitable as exploring in Null and Wormhole space?
---
Oh god, Necromongers and hotdropoclock enterprise... Yeah no wonder they couldn't even get an awox together.
---
CODE's entire shtick is whining about miners and pretending to be pvpers
---
There was 7 in fleet and only 5 showed up, 2 warped when dominix died, and stabber and gnosis were easy kills
---
Signal Distortion Amplifier II is worse, the exact same ECM bonus as meta 4, but more CPU.
---
Wormhole ratting will beat that income easily. More generally, it looks like you're listing the reward for a Sansha's site. To get a better point of comparison, figure out how many sites you find and run per hour. This number will still be higher than you can get with most subcap null ratting or mining.
---
That's not even an achievement.
---
Living in a C5 means that groups rolling for C5s can roll into you (and provide you content). Living in a C6 means the same with groups rolling for C6s, but there are fewer of those and they're looking to catch multiple capitals, not have a brawl with you.
---
Well then, since you apparently completely missed it, EVE is extremely heavy on horizontal progression. While the total amount of SP in the game is absurd(27 years of training yadda yadda), if you focus on only one specific thing you can catch up rather quickly. You don't need perfect Planetary Interaction skills to lolpvp in an Atron, or perfect scanning skills to mine and refine Scordite.
---
Even the skills themselves are designed to accomodate this by being very "front heavy" - you gain 80% of the skill's "power" in 20% of the total training time.

Here's mine. Not that I play eve anymore beyond every 2 months when I log in to add more skills to the queue. :(

The listed damage cap is 5000 for all stages tho. (Same as for all other medium citadels.)

Well, it's real for someone out there...
---
Mining gas in high class wormholes is about 90 mil/hr and doesn‚Äôt require any action except warping off when sleepers arrive after 15 minutes. If you‚Äôre not a wormholer btw and have to spend time specifically scanning for gas sites then it‚Äôs not as great, but as a wormholer you just find them naturally and it‚Äôs great money. 
---
Myrm ratting is only like 50 mil/hr but you can do it while watching Netflix, which is nice. 
---
Normal mining is pretty bad, unfortunately. 
---
FW/burner missions are amazing isk if you know what you‚Äôre doing. 
---
Doing escalations with a t3 is also pretty good. 
---
Abyssals are great if you don‚Äôt die. Especially in the t5s. 
---
incursion is pretty good money (120 mil/he) if you can put up with the comms
---
But yeah, exploration is one of the best income sources in the game once you‚Äôre good at it, and it sounds like you are. Short of capital pve and complicated stuff like abyssals and missions you won‚Äôt find anything that makes you more isk/hr, just things with a better isk/ effort ratio

---
&gt;  Inevitably they build it, the rest of EVE allies together to blow it up and a glorious war begins?

I think your "inevitably" is most likely going to turn into a "nobody will do a damn thing about it" because it's absolutly unfun to fight around a keepstar already, even more so at the heart of Delve.
---

Yep, IGN is Kai'ne Sicturus. Feel free to drop me an in game convo/mail. I'll be home in an hour, and can answer any questions you may have!

Nothing we can do about that. But maybe this would give other entities (TEST?) an excuse to fight on the other side?
---
A wh group that hasn't realized you can pvp in wormholes, aside from evicting irrelevant structures like exit strat had been doing for years
---
Problem is that this kind of war can only be maintained for so long. There need to be day-to-day objectives, like killing POS were.
---
Yeah, for them too. I'm not sure it would be terrible. It might even push people to adopt a "war economy" (resources funneled to war assets, not trade) and go on the offensive. It might make war losses hurt more, which is again not terrible.
---
Find two more guys and run emerging conduits.
---
If test was to flip, and I'm not saying they are obligated, there could be a fight. I think.
---
Wat?
---
I haven't seen you on wow since launch day :(
---
Yeah, but I'm not so sure tbh. Test wasn't sleeping either the last couple months, as well as horde and I guess frat.
---
Goons are the incredibly strong, but a huge part is the fortification.
---
And that has to change anyway if a war of any significance is to be fought ever again. 
---
All that said, I do understand why test holds a grudge against panfam more than goons these days. What reason would they have to switch sides, really?

---
I respect your opinion and I agree with it.
---
It does not change the fact that the bad things that can happen to "peaceful" people in Highsec drive them from the game. 
---
When our playerbase was rising steadily we could safely say "Eve is just for hardcore players, it weeds out the weak." 
---
Now we are where we are, I look back and realise that many of the people I have known who have quit for reasons like this are people I would much rather have had in the player base if the trade off was a truly "safe" highsec. 
---
I worry that we have systems which have weeded out the weak and left us with too few.

tl;dr exit strat bad pvp people :(

Citadel construction only requires T1 minerals and PI material. The total mineral requirement if I remember correctly is about 80 titans worth (an amount mined in Delve basically monthly anyway). Thus it'd only really be other citadels and deployable structures that would increase in price.
---
nice drop missy :)
---
Injectors are bad. No question about it.
---
I think a sale to any other owner would put pressure on CCP, im not sure PA is worse in that regard.
---
What i feel is the weight of years of citadel building and unlimited sotiyo- titan production with way too strong rorquals.
---
Injectors were just the last straw.
---
I assume, the reason for the link is that it would be technically impossible to find out "all bookmark folders, which I have ACL permission for". On the other hand, it's relatively fine to test "do I have permission for this one bookmark folder" (or structure). Thus, I don't see any reason, why the system wouldn't be build so that when you have subscribed and request bookmarks, the system will check the ACL again, and if you don't have permission anymore, you will be kicked out.  
---
That said, I recommend to test this usecase in duality, so there aren't any clear bugs. I wouldn't be surprised if CCP forgets to test UI when revoking access.
---
&gt; got an uwu tattoo
---
Yeah, that's the kind of person who could have fun with EVE at the moment.
---
I am not saying it is likely to happen either, but at the current state that is about the only option to get rid of them and parts of the super fleet
---
You know what? I also enjoy playing EvE these days (casually) and have been playing basically since 2006.
---
BUT:
---
I also see all the glaring issues the game has, in particular 0.0 game systems and the resulting stagnation. I also see what CCP is doing / not doing (seemingly super slow development speed) and the bad communication what is going on / coming in the not too distant future (roadmap?). CCP needs pressure to do things, was always like this. So we need to speak up for things to change, even if we have no problem to play right now...

Last time imperium rolled north, the move was with over 1k titans alone. Goons pulled most of those. Looking at what's going on at goon market they adding around 2 per week to that + those they holding back for srp. Test might have added quite a few to them as well but as long as goons keep at this rate there is no catching up.
---
Goons also grew so big that they can cover any tz with good numbers so even the old tz war can't fix it. I don't know what ccp could possibly do to fix this tbh
---
Afaik no, might be wrong though. Otherwise the outcry of the shield super users that they need to spend 4-5b to get the same amount of ehp they had before wouldnt justify how many are asking for shield slaves

I could also understand if it was a paid mercenary job (kill all neutral miners who are mining from the moon i just popped) but alot of gankers seem to just do it because they can (my ship worth 5m, enemy ship worth 20m, long live my killboard stats!).
---
I guess i should try to understand it and just quote TDK: "Some men just want to watch the world burn".
---
Sadly no one on my region do PI so I have to do all of it, hauling PI goods to high sec require wormholes and its not always have a good one. But now my corp leader says he want some T4 PI goods for keepstar so I'm thinking about create more alts to make it. Now I have lvl 4 PI skills and I think I can run 1-2 T4 factory on each account

Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

Good luck killing it when Goons and their allies will have every single supercapital they own sat on top of it. Thats stupidly heavy Tidi on top of a very boring structure grind IF you could even get enough ships into the system to harm the Keepstar.
---
You saw what happened to the North when TEST and Goons combined their superfleets. The Palatine wouldn't even be touched.
---
Mining is a trap. It seems like an interesting profession but its not. You activate your mining lasers on a rock. Go afk for a while then come back and deposit your ore. Thats the entire gameplay loop.
---
Mining is something bots do and people who are at work with the ability to periodically check eve do.

For newbs exploration is the best income. Scanning down relic sites in wormholes can net you 100 mil in a site.

I must admit, the fitting manager overhaul was amazing work, I wouldn't be too surprised if default overview overhaul is coming sometime in the next 6-12 months. Window positions, eh, you generally end up getting comfy with a personal setup that works for nobody else, so default positions are fine being crap.
---
Lies! We all know tapi would never ever protect or suupport botters
---
About the NPE: Give them a set of PvP-oriented missions. Decide for one HS-system being a "T1-frigs only arena", FFA. "Go there, die a few times and whatever happens to you in there, remember: The real space will be harsh and unforgiving, too. This aint a place for ppl who cant deal with getting a boot into the face every now and then."
---
I made twice that ammount in one afternoon of dedicated exoration from a single site. 500+mil in total.

Definitely some Banished.
---
And have all 4 of us be the only people posting in thos sub for the day?
---
I like it.
---
You know it doesn't actually say that the drop in AOM's members has anything to do with that right?
---
Because it‚Äôs the ultimate symbol of status and what‚Äôs anything in this game if not status. Also I think they‚Äôd like the war that follows, they‚Äôll think they can prove they can hold it.
---
Because they like Outer Passage obviously...
---
Inevitably they don't bother to build it.... because why would they?
---
This is true lol
---
&gt;mechanic is manageable by normal player spawns able to kill a super warping to 'forsaken hub' are to be considered unmanageable
---
So for super owners wenhave business as usual and everyone poorer now has extra bariers?
---
Newbro here, Why is this getting down voted?
---
You know drop in players online doesn't actually say anything about blackout effect? Just coincidence!
---
&gt; I'm feeling positive (Goon 2k19)
---
Must have been because the colossal was empty and no other fellow miner contested his ticks
---
Im not a miner either... Doesn't mean i dont occasionally hop in a barge though

(can't believe I'm agreeing with The Judge)
---
Nowhere have I said Provi has not improved. What I have said though is history tends to repeat itself.
---
So, if you want to interpret I want a strong Provi and the fact Provi leadership is still a clusterfuck as "grrrrrr Provi git gud" so you can feel better about yourself and your coalition, then I'm not going to stop you. I hope it provides more motivation to fix what is broken.
---
But you guys aren't strong yet and have a long way to go before you will be. Whether you see it from the inside or not isn't my issue. I have the benefit of seeing it from both the inside and the outside but you don't have to believe me either.
---
Posting unrelated data and drawing conclusions with a 3 day old reddit alt. Meh.
---
No, because those things will eat your fighters. 
---
       
---
It is not about promote super ratting, but to not lead to situation where super ratting was the only viable option like the blackout proved.            
---
By manageable i mean one of those things :                  
---
* player can warp off if he is paying enough attention        
---
* survive enough to call for help to fight the rats with someone in better ship           
---
* fight the rats off if his ship is good enough             
---
* have time/ability to kill the tackling ships and warp off
---
Nullsec has that filter, because there are battleship spawns and even capitals?
---
Blackout was bad for many reasons.        
---
It was not only about lack of rewards but about mechanic that most players didn't want to engage in.        
---
Not many players like to fly blind - as online drop proved it and i bet CCP still feel the blackout hit on the sub numbers.
---
Do banned characters immediately transferred to Doomheim?
---
Nope ???        
---
Faction rats are less demanding than normal site rats.      
---
Capital spawns are easily manageable ^(aka you can just warp off) and they are only on big sites.
---
&gt; The 100% safe technique
---
There is no such thing. Safer in the moment? Sure definitely. Safer long term when people come to pop your undefended pinata of a citadel? Not so much.
---
There is already 3 keepstars in 1DQ. If Palatine were to be built as you suggest, there would be 4.
---
Because they think I‚Äôm flexing, OP asked for the max possible, and I have made that much over an hour, a lot of times it lower, yea.
---
But relic sites are about 10-70m each, a lot of mine tend to be ~30m, I can find at least 4-6 an hour, I go through jspace, pop out in null, set a route on the map that covers as many systems that I don‚Äôt think are busy or likely to be camped.
---
Jump, cloak, scan, hack, repeat; gotta be on your toes, I get chased by dictors on gates, that‚Äôs easy to get away from in a Astero, I don‚Äôt hack if people are in local and I don‚Äôt know they are non-combat, I don‚Äôt wait around hopping they go away just keep moving.
---
If the area gets hot, or someone is trying to chase me from system to system, just head back to the hole I came from, or scan down a new one, and go to a different region.

I've got a new RGB mechanical keyboard since this pic was taken.
---
Yeah, but is it `#FE0000`, `#FF0101`, or `#FF1111`?
---
Doesn't matter much to a person, matters a quite a bit for a simple bot (and there are countless tricks of a similar nature that, stacked together, could make botting a very complicated endeavor).
---
Of course, making botting harder than writing ransomware only shifts the problem...
---
Im in for the space ships and the fancy all around.   That sense of progression when you get to the  next big thing and are even more efficient doing stuff is something thats super fun for me. So yeah, pve might have been created to fund pvp but to me its fun enough in of itself.  My loop atm is rather:
---
Do PVE and grind isk -&gt; buy a good ship to be better at it -&gt; grind more -&gt; buy large skill injects to sit in a better ship (HACs for example)-&gt; rinse and repeat
---
Yeah... \*rereads\* Jeez, my ole english-teacher d slap me for that sentence... -.-
---
lol can you imagine making 1700 fucking accounts to farm ISK.
---
You came to shitpost on Reddit, so, yeah, looks like you're playing the game perfectly.
---
Yeah but everyone has keepstarts. Nobody has (or can have) palatines if there‚Äôs one in 1DQ. That‚Äôs what this game is about. I have this and you don‚Äôt.
---
Is anyone surprised?
---
Yep. I got tired of doing the math in my head.
---
It's funny that you think people interact the same way with everyone and lump together newcomers in their communities with random nobodies telling them to shut up and fuck off.
---
I chose wisely.
---
Nice, somebody else has the Warthog HOTAS. You can barely see mine on the far right of my shot.
---
And they are trying to say posting here and playing EVE isn't the same.
---
Which would hit everyone, making it harder again to keep up cause goon wallets are still the biggest

Just think how many bots there are with all the alliances bleeding members, you fucking moron
---
It's been so long since I played regularly, I should probably hide from tigers in my E100 üòÖ
---
Agreed.
---
From PVE perspective lack of local can work in WH space where you can close the doors and don't have cynos.      
---
You can react to what is happening around by observing signature spawns and even if you locked out someone in your bear hole - it will be limited number of people that can't call for support or reship.         
---
Unless this is bigger trap but then you are screwed.           
---
In nullsec anyone can always come to the system or by the cyno.       
---
Sure blackout was fun for hunters - but made PVE impossible and very annoying in long term.         
---
What did we see in the last days of blackout?       
---
**empty space and dead pve corporations**              
---
(without even analyzing other things that made blackout bad)      
---
**Now the goal here is to hit botters, and not make people lose stuff to unbalanced rats**          
---
Like i stated initially - rats need to be balanced and allow player a counterplay other than "logging out".          
---
By adding randomness to the equation - you are actually making bot life very miserable.          
---
Now if you allow player to counter play those rats by simply warping off - you are letting to do the same for botters.        
---
But players will move to system where those rats are not showing up or will fight those "random" rat spawns while having both reward and fun in doing it.          
---
Bots on the other hand will most likely need to logoff and wait it out.            
---
This is whole reason of this suggestion - affect bots in a way they need to shut down operation thus making them even less profitable.
---
why is it a bot filter?
---
better use your alt as weber or scoot
---
Let me scare you even more, i maximum loaded 6 HEAT shells into battle, but for the majority of my battles 0.

---
theyre actually some of the most trustable guys in eve. i can swear to you that.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
you give them an issue, theyll give you a price. if you pay. nothing will stop them completing that deal or your money back. but trust me, theyll do it
---
Well, and for some reason you assume that they have the same attitudes dealing with people in-game. I'm not sure why.
---
I guess it‚Äôs just taken as a given that if you play EVE you are also a miniature painter... so where‚Äôs the wet pallet hidden. Probably as messy as mine and not good for pictures.
---
The panda's are FRAT, AOM would be mango culture.
---
Are you actually asking CCP to return drifters? lmao
---
Trust me, the Chinese government is already trying to do that.
---
now i ask in this thread again
---
how does triglavian thing counter bots?
---
Why my posts on r/Eve have been removed and why mods are not responding to my questions ?
---
what randomness?
---
If the monthly salary is 56$ how can you afford a PC with the power to run dozens of eve accounts and internet capable of handling that bandwidth?
---
I believe we‚Äôve already had something like this. They were called Drifters. It didn‚Äôt exactly went well.
---
Alright, message sievert solutions. He forgot to take me off buddy list, so i can see when he is on.

---
oh it'd definitely be in the middle of the dyson sphere where we already have like 30 faction fortizars and 2 keepstars on the same grid.
---
honestly people would be better off pushing us into a corner than grinding all that shit
---
It was posted here that dropping numbers were related to launch of WoW classic.
---
While I cannot be sure if this is true or not - this information was on r/eve before blackout happened.
---
ps Got to admit, that I agree with /u/_TheJudge here, just because correlation is not causation. But to make everyday's judgements, people apply "occam's razor" to get rid of unlikely (from their point of view) explanations. And it's quite interesting to see how people either apply it or not, based on what side they take in an argument.
---
They use omni-damage and if you don't actually kill them, they will kill you if you're targeted. You have to be active and present to deal with them properly.
---
Literally no red flags until now.
---
Clearly you haven't been in the 600 man brawl in amamake last weekend. The server was so shit it gave my depression crippling depression.
---
Yup, you need to develop a strong sense of entitlement, give up joy and fun and replace it with metrics for success such as isk/hr and "kills" whereby "kills" are not a contest of equals but as fast a gank as possible.(so you can max on isk/hr)
---

You no longer can grab it with a DST and need a freighter. So ninja looting is now close to impossible.

Not really, the issue with the current skill injector meta is because people skip out of the Low SP state rather quickly, meaning that almost all the newbro groups use t2/t3 doctrines at this point, meaning for a new player there is less and less entry options that don't include please grind 1/2 skill injectors and honestly if your starting that's really really bad game play.
---
You cannot detect accounts running 23/7 because most common bot usage is running account 2-3hours and logging it off just to login some other account.
---
So you press f4 the whole time and you made a movie about it ?   
---
BRAVO !
---
Yea, we were at -600 Delta at the time 9 days ago. It's doubled since then. 1/3rd of alliance being purged for failing ESI checks. That's sounds quite alot.
---
Yeah. I've been in WERMT boi, don't try to make me believe that. We People Duo and Mineclub bots ran 23/24.
---
If they wanted to improve the game they'd get rid of alts and skill injectors
---
Yep this is why i said i have no idea if this was true, but the drop was attributed to ESI implementation and purge well before dev blog showed up.
---
Like i stated they offered no reward and were OP as fuck.     
---
I even listed them in "how to not do it" part.
---
It was his best friend they met on a minecraft server 3 days ago.

I can honestly say that, for the most part, the trig invasion in high sec is a good thing, and this is coming from a guy that helps run a high sec indy/pve corp. AFK orca mining is more dangerous now, but they also gave us a carrot in the higher mining yield in invaded systems making exhumers and attention mining a thing.  
---
As long as the same type of thing (but stronger and more trigs) comes in nullsec it could be a good thing. If the mining laser effects don't benefit excavators it will make rorqs a support system for barges in nullsec like the orca is now for barges in high sec. Almost, like, you know, their intended purpose.  
---
FYI though, there already are BS that spawn in the trig invasions. They are mean.
---
Thats my point ya dummy
---
Could also add stuff like "Try smuggling this box to that station in that arena-system. People WILL hunt you! Do NOT GET CAUGHT!" Or "Steal some of that special worthless ore from the local belts in the arena-system." Or whatever other activities folks might do in hostile space later. As well as "Hunt some miners in that system!" or "Bring me one of those boxes folsk try to smuggle into the arena-system." All restricted to cheap, tiny ships.
---
If nothing else changed I believe you‚Äôd be right. What I see the palatine being is a reason for the rest of eve to band together so we actually have a big war with relatively even numbers. But if nothing is done to make that war actually fun to fight there‚Äôs little chance.
---
If you dont like random useless tedium you're playing the wrong game. In fact *more* people played eve before CCP caved in to the instant gratification crowd, and the introduction of injectors signaled a downward spiral in player retention. So I hope you being happy was worth killing the game over.
---
Please don't quit, this game badly needs new players.
---
Yodik will have the palatine before the goon and they fear that
---
The whole board is essentially layers of acrylic sandwiched together with a PCB in there, meaning anyone with a laser cutter can build the case himself.
---
Version 1 still had some issues which should hopefully be fixed by now, afterwards I'll throw the vector files on GitHub.
---
cowards lowsec fights, my fleet getting primared fast warp out :)
---
Make it round, mannable and with a jump drive and a planet buster doomsday, change the name to palpatine and tell me if wouldn‚Äôt get built in a month :)

This.
---
Take a t1 frigate, fit it for align. Take it into faction warfare space and start looting wrecks other ppl leave behind. Its very good cash for a new player. Add a salvager for even more loot
---
That's actually worth it for a something like AFK rat shield ishtar you can run in Guristas/Serpentis space. The 5th DDA has a lot of diminishing returns so you fit 2 WCS.

Why would everyone band together to lose trillions of isk in ships just for one pointless structure?

At this point, I don't think there is enough people who would give a shit to contest goons anyway.

---
Hello you seem to be lost.

It looks like you wish to talk with people who play Eve Online?
---
2% less lock range/scan res penalty. Shield AFKtars aren't lacking for fitting space anyways.
---
I mean I‚Äôm assuming that some changes are done so fighting that war is at least a bit of fun.
---
Poor fit it, stay aligned, be prepared to lose it.  You should have less than 1.5b on field.
---
I can understand that if you doesn't have fitting problems. Even if I don't think those 2% will save you when you already have 2x 40% penalty
---
Its PI you need, Jita market is still the biggest followed by Amarr and 1DQ1-A is only third or fourth place.
---
&gt;what kind of ships and applicationswould you like to see
---
None :)
---
Read more r/eve, soon enough you'll be hating it like a normal person.
---
That 2% matters more than it looks, since penalties are multiplicative.
---
Tech 2 is .6*.6 = 36% of normal lock range/scan res
---
Halcyon is .58*.58 = 33.5% of normal lock range/scan res, which is like 7% more.

Do the career missions first, run a a mission or two, mine a bit, dont work on maximizing isk at the start have fun instead. Learn whats good and bad. Then when you feel more comfortable, join a corporation like eve uni, and then go from there, best advice is do something you enjoy, because you wont be playing for long if you go for max isk/hr.
---
Don't let one gank scare you away. A heron and making safe spots is all you need. Remember an Omega popped in a covops or astero just lost 50-100mil. You lose like, 2? Ships are like ammo. WINGSPAN is an iconic part of the wh scene, otherwise it would be too easy.

There's already a ship class bigger than Titans. Only the 4 empires have them tho
---
And since Delve is already a giant content magnet without the Palp why do they need another?
---
 Just because you and your alliance are too lazy to  create your own content doesnt mean Goons need to step in and do it for you.

Want to fight in a war? Start a war. Stop being cowards and fight your own battles instead of piggybacking on other alliances conflicts.

I disagree. My two best gaming friends I've never met IRL, but I've known them for years and would gladly invite them to my hole if they were in town. It's just that they live in the other side of the planet.

Bud i know where factions spawns are happening, but it takes less time to kill a faction rat (not officer) than normal one.

Dreads are rare.

Unless we are talking about diamond rats - and those are not warping to anomalies.

Moon, great job on calling two targets in ten minutes. A paperbag could've been a better FC. Have a great time in Imperium, you're right where you belong mate.

Always aligned, if you're ready to jump to a beacon at any time you'll be mostly safe even if an enemy enters the system while you're in warp.
---
So lets assume that each spawn have 30 points.     
---
BS frigate is 1-3 point ... battleship is 10 points.         
---
If you get this random spawn, with random ewar - players will simply reship to best counter and handle it.      
---
Bots will have to many variables to bring proper counter.     
---
**The idea is to give reward not smaller than normal ratting/mining** for players to kill those rats.      
---
This way people will not be punished as they get reward, but bots will be hit hard.

Low sec carrier ratting never used cyno.
---
With level 5 ratting you put a carrier in the 4 to 5 systems the lvl 5 agent sent you.

You warped your puller in an inty to the system then fleet warped your carrier alt to the mission. The puller jumped back to the agent while the carrier insta blapped the objective.

So even better, you're suggesting that people who only post *here* without interacting with newbros, which would require logging in, drive the latter from the game?

As for people who come here to say they have fun, it's not like they will listen to ones trying to tell them the opposite.

I'm thinking of BoB...
---
&gt; Before your idea can be considered, it needs to be established if wormholes should have free intel.
---
I dislike the term "free intel" because it means "the thing I hate," rather than anything usefully defined.  If you can specify what the free intel is, this time, then we can nail down what would make it no longer free.
---
whats so interesting about this? and what is this screencap showing?
---
Well now we speculate, tbh i expect high number of those banned chars to be in FRT/AOM/RR but we don't have the data.       
---
CCP stated that it will no longer give us this data after last time.
---
k
---
 Can we just like... not?
---
Ewar doesn't effect drones, so no one will have to reship, fits might change to include a sebo if ecm is common but that's it. Bots will just primary ecm and ships that are pointing them (like players will), bots will attempt to burn away and warp out if a neutral enters local (like players will), and bots will die if they can't either kill all npc tackle or burn away before a player catches them (like players will).
---
Adapting to this change is as simple as adding a script to primary tackle, and a script to align out with prop mod on if tackled by npc rats when a neutral enters local.
---
Hahahahahahah yah don‚Äôt log in
---
Well sure but awoxing is one of the "cool things that make eve great" so shouldn't it be a bad thing then that it failed; because the cool, salt generating thing failed? Rather than it being a good thing that OP didn't get screwed?
---
Two responses: Then you don't understand how the bots work, and people need to stop being AFK while undocked in the game for extended periods of time. It's really that simple.
---
What about invention? Tbh i don't know why this is called 'invention' if you are inventing the same thing 50.000 th time in a row.
---
I had a x-type rep and a faction disintegrator, it would have been hell to claw that back
---
Becauss the old guard got the ccp friendship Leeloodalas multipass that is T2BPO's to avoid this.
---
Best friend IN GAME. NOT irl.
---
but most things don't have those.
---
Actually my alliance is goon aligned I don‚Äôt know why you assume it‚Äôs not. What do you think that goons don‚Äôt get bored? That they don‚Äôt want fights? That they wouldn‚Äôt build the palpatine just to bait the invasion?
---
I've also had friends that left due to that reason, but they were most definitely not what you would consider a new player. 
---
Just to clarify, I'm not saying people haven't left the game due to griefing. I'm saying the "new players are leaving because of griefers" urban legend is just that... an urban legend used to vilify a certain type of play style in the game. 
---
Before high sec griefers became the target of this, it was low sec pirates that "ruined the game for everyone." This is a constantly shifting target by a portion of the player base that seems to want Eve to be a complete Easy-Mode game. Doing that, however, will absolutely kill what makes Eve unique among all other MMOs.
---
I'd like to see a support Titan with less firepower, but maybe a bonus to the phenomena generators? Maybe slightly cheaper and get a bonus to bridges as well?
---

---
I'm not gonna lie. I want this.
---
Maybe make it so older players could participate to show noobs technique but there's some sort of temporary debuff of skills to match the noobs level so it's a more equal fight, but ONLY in this area. 
---
I dunno. Just spitballing.

I don‚Äôt think anyone is ganking afk Orcas except maybe npc rats. Who exactly is complaining about being an afk Orca?
---
so you mean miners have to fight these things? they dont just go somewhere else?
---
Good point, some suggestions. Systems with the Fluid Router installed/online cannot be cyno jammed? 
---
I was hoping that smaller alliances would be more free to take sov when blackout is a thing.
---
I did some hi-sec mining and got ganged by CODE. Overall i was alone in a single ship so i was an easy target mining in the most obvious place in space so i did not like it but the reason i did not like it was simple... I never ever tried to be creative i was too predictable so i was a sweet target.
---
Null sec mining is hardcore and i love it. Loved the blackout loved the challenge. Laughed at all players that called miners care bears. It takes quite some time to prepare for a mining op. I run 4 characters only... One boost and 3 miners from which one is a Combat pilot so skills on mining are low. My routine is to scan for signatures roll all WH in the vicinity of my mining op than setup alpha alts in the perimeter and mine my heart out. Cloacky campers we dealt with by scaling down to a cheaper boost + tanked procurers with the occasional battle procurer in the mix for a nice surprise.  
---
However something to share here and possibly the reason for most peoples tears towards CCP. A few days ago i took an assault frigate and went into Delve to hunt miners and other small ships. Once i entered fortress Delve i realized how miserable my and the alliance mining operations  are comparing to what is happening in that space. My D-scan was filled with rorquals, super carriers and carriers in most systems i went into. I had very few targets that i would dare to engage and the amount of ISK generation in that space is shocking. And as unfortunate i also do realize that this is how the game is designed to be played.   
---
So my moral of this story is: Learn to adapt and overcome and remember a bundle of twigs is always stronger than a single twig!
---
\`A single twig breaks, but the bundle of twigs is strong\` Tecumseh
---
It doesn't have to be. You can buy the pre-made T2 drone parts and just run 10x 2 hour factory jobs printing out T2 drones for really nice margins.
---
It seems backwards. Highsec should be safer since its for noobs.
---
So, I can see you've used TinyMiner or IsoBox before. 
---
Yep, the botting miners ships can generally warp out rather quickly. However, the larger Orcas don't and they suffer a lot of damage before they can warp, and those macros mess up a lot. Sometimes the ship doesn't dock if it can't execute the scripted command immediately for some reason.
---
Also, just forcing them to dock interrupts their revenue stream and, eventually, any good botting company will realize that it's just not worth their while to keep botting. It's not an end-all, be-all solution, but it does work to disrupt the botters and force an attrition rate on them.
---
Honestly, I think the regular NPCs in the belts should be juiced up to deliver more damage depending of the security level of the system.
---
If i remember correctly reactions cannot be done high sec, right?
---
Should have mentioned that too.
---
always take the bait. 
---
f u op, let's fight.
---
CCP Triglavian confirmed!
---
SOE Titan, can create a random wh like Sansha's incursion tech.
---
Newp, not at all. I know how to run a business though, so I turn a profit. I think my corporation routinely pulls in 1-2 billion ISK a week as a team (not me individually), anywhere from 250 - 500 million ISK from our market orders, and maybe 250 million ISK a week on sales of standard ass Tech 1 ships and modules. Add in around a day of Lvl4 mission running and it's really not a problem at all to purchase a new Orca if I lose one.
---
I fit occators like this for speed when doing normal hauls but for the value onboarding I would have used a tanked dst for fear of gankers in highsec.
---
So think it through. He clearly is not a friend. You should never trust a person you've never met in real life.
---
The internet is built on lies and built for lying. And EVE is the most backstabbing game ever created... That's just the facts.
---
Shutting down tranquility could be next step for chaos era.
---
I have a irl job, and as far as extra investment into the game I think I‚Äôm only going to stay with the omega for right now
---
Imagine still believing a bait post from a week ago
---
Any professional gank attempt is going to be sure they have enough dps on grid to actually land the kill. One or two alts trying to rep is not likely to make a difference.
---
Better to use one alt as a webber.
---
After jumping your freighter and your web bonused alt, activate warp with the freighter, let it begin to accelerate for a few seconds. Then have the alt web it. As the web lands your maximum speed falls below the warp speed activation threshold and you immediately initiate a warp.
---
This practice is referred to as slingshotting.
---
If you and the alt are in a corp, then you need to make sure that intra-corp aggression is turned on. Otherwise (or if your hauler/alts are in diff corps) you can initiate a duel between the web alt and the freighter.
---
*Make sure the duel invite is from your alt before accepting.* People can and will attempt to send your freighter duel invites claiming they just want to help slingshot you only to turn around and use the duel to legally kill your hauler.
---
Yeah, I'm a lazy industrialist at the best of times - but margins on T2 ship production always seem to be lower than many modules.

---
Seriously, some of my best friends are ones I've met because I arranged to meet people I gamed with.
---
Even better, have the launcher only work 10% of the time. That would also shake up the meta
---
Add NPCs that act like players but don't appear in local but aren't players because if players do it it's offensive to me.
---
Because the krabs will whine if they do something beneficial like that. You saw how they whined about Blackout. You were one of the people whining.
---
Back in 2012/2013 (around then anyway) I built a batch of 1,000 from goo-up (no reactions, just everything else).  They took quite a while to put together.  The did sell like hot cakes though  but with today's server numbers I think I'd have to babysit that order for quite some time to shift them.
---
Everybody wants to be the guy making ships and guns because they're glamorous. It's the same with other MMOs where everyone wants to make armor and swords. Nobody cares about the other shit, and that's where the money is.
---
Something about having to do SIXTY sites to recover the cost (not counting loot and escalations) of a carrier that's pretty much now disposable really makes me feel quite nauseous.
---
It's almost as if CCP is making PvE experiences for bots to enjoy, not Humans.
---
tis how i was able to afford my first Imp
---
you still have time to play eve with that lawn?
---
So much this...
---
Do note that Hadaugago is a rookie system.  If someone is moving from a rookie system, how much research would they know to do? Who would they know for a Corp? They just want to move out of the new player area, and if one of their first experiences is "everything you own is ash" how long will they last?
---
So if you're pointed by a rat you may or may not be screwed.  It's just chance.
---
Yes!  This would have been better than blackout.  Make a concession that medium structures can be disabled to low power in one assault in 0.0 space.  Maybe slash the fuel cost of the drills to help balance that out a bit. So a small gang can shut down a moon extraction in one sitting.  
---
Every single system has 20-50 moons.  It‚Äôs not like that one small gang is gonna shut them all down in one sitting...
---
You‚Äôd also have gangs of rorquals out gating to get to the Nextdoor system since those moons are up.   Creates targets.  Creates potential for Jim bob and his 20 rorqs to be bubbled on a gate by a gang of dreads maybe?  Or a blops drop?  
---
Further, Anoms aren‚Äôt needed anymore.  We have active moon mining which drops the same mineral rich ores as you have in the anoms.  Or at least make them inversely proportionate to the amounts of ore mined.  Meaning every system starts out with collassals.  The more ore you mine you do two things:  increasing the industry index which lowers the system tax and will start to despawn anoms.  At level 5 you have only smalls.   This way, smaller groups who can‚Äôt fuel 100s of athanors can still park their rorquals in a constellation and pull out minerals.  Can‚Äôt overfarm it tho!
---
Valid point, as this is where tiericide patches suddenly stopped without an explanation so they could put more resources to FarmVi... erm Farms&amp;Fields.

100% this.
---
Yes, sites are &lt; 30m.  They're about 25m average.
---
In ancient times the grey haired elders told us some miracolous things like "Always kill tacklers first". There are also rumours that Capitals used to warp at ranges to anoms and that usually tacklers were dead before they reached them.
---
*hotdropoclock* ah ye those guys were toxic asf when i was in horde
---
Ya I saw one near there last night
---
The thing is you need to bring more than a few dudes in supers to counter them. You need to like "form a fleet" to defend "major assets". Too much of a hassle.
---
What if CCP found a way to go back in time and balance the game into a playable state 5 years ago
---
Bombs + toros + mjd = a fleet that can deal with caps, some subs (read as any sub that is ~30km away from the fleet), and gtfo with ease if there is anything that threatens it. 
---
So yes, it needs nerfing.
---
I'm sure it's easy to keep all your ducks in a row as you grind through your 60th site.  Good luck with your ratting experience.
---
stop posting pictures of my sisters bedroom!!!
---
^real talk right here
---
It's almost like you have to think about it and actually form a defence fleet.
---
&gt; your 60th site
---
Ther is your problem ;-P, I never managed more than 2-3 hours in a row, as it is mind numbing
---
It's not quite 60. Each haven is worth like 30 million. Insurance gives your carrier 750million back. So it's 25 sites to break even if you lose your ship.
---
What happened to the page? Did they just vanish or did it became too expensive for the owner?
---
Okay, so you form a defense fleet. Assuming you don‚Äôt get bombed off the field immediately, the bombers just get mjd‚Äôd off and they are gone, no catching them. 
---
That is the problem, their ability to deal huge damage then just moonwalk out. It should be one or the other.
---
That's why I think CCP makes PvE experiences for bots, not Humans.  Who in their right mind is going to do that without a little "assistance".
---
I don't disagree with you. I see that problem stemming from activity not counting for anything.Love it or hate it, skilling spree is the first thing I've seen that rewards activity. The idea that you need to wait 6 months to a year to start playing a game is stupid. I know there are things that can be done earlier than that, but having to wait that long to attempt something that interests a new player is crippling from a marketing stand point.

fuck triple sebo, fuck active tank on a carrier, fuck tank rigs, fuck t2 cap mods, you warp at 70 or 100 and align to next site, or to safe, something comes in system align to safe, pull 1 fighter swap it to siren and check intel. if you see a gang, warp out, if you dont and the dude is in something other then a dictor or a reacon and lands at your site, kill it . Im at 5 killmarks so far. if it is a dictor or a recon, warp to safe, if there are probes out jump to a beacon
---
Sounds like you just want easy kills mate.
---
I gotcha. Makes sense lol seems like a scheme that they use to bring income in I see lol
---
They are "ideal" BECAUSE they are OP lol.
---
Rock haven is about 40 Mio. ISK bounties in total excluding special spawns. Hyper-Niddi does around 1 - 1.2 of them in one 20-minutes-tick equalling 120-140 Mio ISK per hour (before taxes)
---
Imo the only thing bad about bombers is how cloaking works. You shouldn't be able to sit cloaked and invisible afk in a system for 12 hours and then go blow up one guy and cloak back up afk (in any ship). I'd like to see a change where cloak drains capacitor and covops ships have a trait that reduces drain rate. The afk cloak shit is just dumb, if someone is actively hunting with their bomber (or fleet of bombers) give then a 2hr window of cloak or something. Plenty of time to find a target, kill it recap and then go back out there.
---
What's the time to run a site? &lt;10 minutes? My missile skills are poor since I don't use them much, but clearing a ~40m site is ~20-25 minutes. 
---
Honestly, I'm ok with capital ships being risky to use, since 1.5b isn't much, especially if time to replace is less than 10 hours.
---
https://twitter.com/theatrus/status/908429974377349120?s=20
---
Yes, but null miners have titans and supers in 2019. So don't worry about nullsec miners
---
Just so you know too, wormhole loot from a site is going to be closer to 20-30m for a "meh" relic site too normally, and I've had individual cans worth 60m+, and wormholes worth 400m+ in sites (even after I blew up a 40m can because I was very tired...)
---
Keep at it! It's a great way for newbros and new explorers to make isk and learn how to fly better.
---
Plus it gives me content in my WH :P
---
Completely unrelated. You've made 2 posts already go cry about it there.
---
What a load of shit. Bring something other than caps and you'll kill plenty.
---
Except the cheaper part
---
I don't mind them being risky to use either.  My problem is CCP making PvE that only a bot would want to do.  
---
They do have plex to sell.
---
Oh hey Excaliburs. Who was the guy in TDF?
---
It is more about bombers with trig dessies and command destroyers. This can take any fleet or run from any situation that can harm them. Torps and bombs can kill any subcap fleet. Even if you sacrifice half of bombers for it - you are isk positive and you won
---
Topic itself unrelated, method large nullblocs cheer CCP into patches not catering the games health but just their (organisations) success is the same, thus I see a relation ...
---
I guess I‚Äôll try both then!
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be a shame if there were easy kills for both sides eh? ;)
---
Pretty much this. Bombers haven't really changed in the last few years. Command dessies have been around for years as well. What can bombers do now that they couldn't do 2 years ago? Nobody was whining about them then.
---
Yeah true
---
Incursions are just as bad.
---
It also doesn't add new items for months
---
&gt; projection
---
Bomber torps go out to 90 and still deal &gt;500 DPS. Things like Jackdaws, Confessors, and Harpies don't come close to those numbers.
---
&gt; kid 
---
I chuckled ...
---
Its garbage and going downhill with each patch.
---
Because it would scare of crabbers and make hunters less likely to catch prey. Null is hunting ground for PVPers. What Null needs is not NPC hunters, it is more real player hunters and more scraming Rats on anomalies.
---
That too, it drives me mad
---
Holy shit. Someone call the police I just witnessed a murder.
---
V
---
Obviously now not a friend
---
Jackdaws can go out to 118+ depending on the fit, and it doesn't take many of them to alpha a bomber.
---
I bet you did. Can‚Äôt handle logic so you laugh it off
---
It's not hard to warp @ 100 and press align as soon as you land...
---
That‚Äôs already happening.
---
Well, you are here for a start...
---
Plat insure, rat to 400-500m to break even and hope for the best...
---
Maybe it could be loosely defined as some kind of information that the design of the game does not intend to provide to players at all or in the way players effectively receive it.
---
There used to be 3rd party program called eve refinery, that would check your loot and would tell if it's worth selling or reprocessing. I've found it, but it no longer works, because it needs API.
---
Is there somethink like that around? web based would be best I think.
---
Thanks.
---
Is that what "redpill" means now?
---
I chuckled that I got called kid at my age. Also you are not logic, you are just bitter and scream "revenge for my stupid losses" through all of your posts ...
---
There are times I am baffled too.  
---
If you start with low price ore, you can often build well below the Jita Sell prices.  Buying the T2 Components and building from those eliminates a lot of the possible profit.  
---
Yet, I still see things on sale in Jita far below any imaginable profit.  Two things come to mind.  Either the seller picked up all the items in a firesale or other non-building method and is simply wanting a quick sale, OR the person picked up the raw materials (ore or components) at a huge discount, making their build costs much lower than anyone else can compete with.
---
okay, so how about +5x wormholes everywhere
---
The shitposting will continue until morale improves
---
A total and complete overhaul to PVE in Eve would be pretty awesome if we lived in a world where such a thing were possible.
---
Doing anything like missions or ratting sites is just unbelievably tedious and repetitive. Group activities like incursions or mining with friends become tolerable only because of the group making it so they are just as bad at their core themselves. 
---
Eve players cheese things out of boredom a lot of times and needing a backstop like Netflix or yakking with your friends to pass the time while totally tuned out trying to PVE is unhealthy.
---
Or T2 Entosis Link
---
Profit = net in - net out
---
A function of population? The added danger should go where the people are!
---
My experience was two dozen mackinaws.  Mined what I could.  had to buy the rest out in sov null.  
---
I don‚Äôt believe it was net profitable.
---
Sounds like you just need to get off those forums. Orca pilots complaining about ganks in high sec is definitely disconnected with reality. There needs to be a certain element of protection for new pilots and basic barges, but advanced ships and more tenured players need to be motivated to move to low and null.
---
I don't think booshers are fine in any way. The ability to outsource mobility infinitely to an external ship is just not balanced. Self-fitted mobility has limitations and is expensive on fitting. AB has limited tactical mobility, MWD has sig bloom, cap penalty, and high cap drain. Self MJD has long cooldown. Booshers have none of these disadvantages for the "cost" of adding a hull.
---
Boosters have no counters that exist outside of being in scram range, and "long scram" doesn't exist. The ball of DPS ships around a boosher can clear tackle off of it extremely quickly. Unless you have enough scram to get every single boosher, if one boosh out of a bunch goes off it also grabs all your tackle with it to be killed.
---
However, in the current meta booshers are a necessary evil because without booshes, subs have no defense against capital balls, and boosh is what allows them to survive against capitals. The nerf to boosh, bombers, and caps have to come all that once to shorten all three legs of the stool at once instead of leaving a long leg to imbalance the whole thing.
---
Bombers completely eliminated battleship fleets from the meta. And they are a good threat to capitals. 
---
But really they are easily countered.
---
&gt; Form an Ares fleet
---
Kikimora says hi.
---
It‚Äôs not bombers it‚Äôs the back to back booshing that basically removes risk as long as your fleet can remotely learn how to turn on afterburners and anchor at 0.
---
That's not a "new" take, mate. I believe it's #7 in the "ECM change suggestion" rotation.
---
&gt;you could lose 3/6 guns
---
How would that work with weapon grouping? Would it automatically un-group the weapons? If not, then you'd pretty much have to either shut the group down or not.
---
&gt;they shut down rep cycles
---
Which would make shield reps the only subcap logi meta that made sense, since those fire at the top of the cycle whereas armor reps fire at the end.
---
&gt;scrams
---
Yes. Because EC-300 drones need a buff. /s
---
All in all I don't think you've really thought this through to it's conclusion. It would create a bunch of other imbalances and weirdnesses in the process.
---
Layman's understanding of Indy:
---
Obtain materials -&gt; ??? -&gt; Profit
---
The simplified reality:
---
1	Copy BPOs
---
2	Obtain moon rocks
---
3	Haul uncompressable moon rocks to refine citadel
---
4	Calculate missing materials (based on what you were able to get locally)
---
5	Obtain missing raw goo (usually jita, some local)
---
6	Obtain compressed ore/ice as well as datacores/decryptors/PI/salvage as needed (usually jita, some local)
---
7	Obtain and meta/faction modules/ammo as needed (almost entirely jita)
---
8	Haul everything to refine/production citadel
---
9	Refine
---
10	Haul all isotopes/minerals to production citadel
---
11	Begin production of Fuel blocks
---
12	Haul over completed T1 BPCs to invention and production citadels as required
---
13	Begin invention process
---
14	Start building T1 hulls/modules, T1/T2 rigs, and any T1 ammo if you actually require it
---
15	Haul fuel blocks back to refine citadel (doubles as reaction)
---
16	Start simple reaction process
---
17	Start complex reaction process
---
18	Start building T2 components/ammo
---
19	Start building T2 hulls
---
20	Haul everything to desired systems
---
21	Fit everything then contract (or just place on market)
---
22	Profit
---
Obviously several of these will be done in tandem or pre-stocked. BPOs are almost always kept in copy as well as mineral/isotope/fuel block stockpiles for example. But ya, it's simple, requires no planning, time, or investment of capital. Minerals are free after all and so is your time, slave.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve never been impressed with implementation of continuous booshing.
---
stukas are just the only doctrine able to somewhat stay on supergrids. nerf super applicatoins to say cruisers and below and all of a sudden other doctrines would get used more often.
---
but sadly 99% of the smoothbrains just react with throwing more supers at their ''problem'' instead of just bringing a counter. and cry afterwards for nerfs when in facts its their ''op'' ships that lead to only one doctrine beeing viable/getting used.
---
&gt;  a small 20-pilot Jackdaw fleet fit with defenders hard counters pretty much any size bomber fleet

The difficulty is flash forming that before the bombers blap their target and moonwalk out.
---
Most people are complacent from just being able to press cyno and summon backup.
---
I mean if it‚Äôs bombers without recons nano gangs just press their prop mods.
---
&gt; To figure out what time/date the owner has set use a relic/data hacking module on the structure and beat the minigame.
---
But when you rf it, it shows how many days/hours remaining yes?
---
Small unprepared targets should die to cloaky CovOps 100+ people gang. They should not be easily savable. 
---
Besides, the complaints stem from capital pilots that try to fight bombers on grid without subcaps support and lose. We both know this.
---
Largely wormhole crews who need gank power and real doctrines that can hold a grid for more than a couple minutes
---
My arazu would like to say hi with its bonused faction boosted scram
---
There's no way to prepare against covert cyno besides being in a super/rorqual that can tank 100 bombers long enough for help to arrive, or just not undocking if you are in a subcap. That's not healthy gameplay. Then when your response arrives the bombers just scatter and you kill nothing.
---
There were some whines about them killing battleship fleets back then.
---
It's simple you just export you mining labor ( especially highsec minerals ) onto a bunch of clueless newbro's, making sure you paying heavily under real value because it's for the good of the corp or something. 
---
by the time most of the new guy's figure out the scam they should have been mining ore for a couple of months and you can just cycle them out.
---
I thought that it's interesting that largely the only hacs are being over-represented largely by a single hull.
---
Instawarping interceptors say "Get better pilots." Or teach your FCs how to run SwordFleets.
---
That is kinda what they're for.
---
no, you‚Äôre just being ignorant because you can‚Äôt stand someone having a different worldview and you laugh because it‚Äôs easier than trying to be a mature adult and understand jt
---
Gankers aren't stupid. If we see a couple logi buzzing around your loot pinata we'll bring an extra Talos to punch through the reps.
---
A 10 million ISK mining permit is the best freighter insurance. Even if there was only a 1% chance of it working, it would still make sense to buy one. It sends a clear message to the would-be ganker that you follow the Code, eg. by fitting a stiff tank, not autopiloting, and splitting valuable shipments into multiple loads.
---
This is completely untrue. Three basic ways of preparing for this is keeping an eye on local, scouting and picketing holes in your ratting systems, and using MJDs to escape tackle. 
---
Risk is entirely healthy for the game and economy both.
---
That only goes to 35 with skirm boosts, still 25km short of bomber DPS range and well within range of Kikis.
---
200 hundred bombers vs 200 hundred jackdaws with defender launchers... 
---
Simples really
---
So what you're implying is that any sort of ship-to-ship communication should be ceased, because why exactly lore-wise?
---
Ceptors within scram range of kiki's/retri don't live long. They don't even need webs to track you, a long point is enough.
---
bud I've seen a 170 man goon jackdaw fleet. It did stupid high damage to a good distance.  get fucked with your argument
---
If you're not dumb getting caught in a ratting carrier is impossible and only happens due to bad luck/timing. Meaning a neut jumped into the system and you happen to be in warp to a haven and he just happens to have warped to that haven as well. The chances of that are very low. Otherwise. Warp at 100 and first thing you do is align out to a fort. Once that's done start ratting. Neut gets reported next door or jumps into your system you pull your fighters and warp to the fort.
---
Please tell the difference between 
---
"I can't even lock on the target, fuck this game"
---
 and 
---
"I can't activate all my offensive modules, fuck this game"
---
That's a prepared fleet, not a "flash form to save whatever the fuck got tackled fleet". If the target can tank 15 minutes then yeah, 100 jackdaws will annihilate any frigate fleet. But the frigates can just fuck off.
---
None of those do anything to AFK cloakers with covert cyno, which is the most efficient way of hunting ratters.
---
Nah, just like this :D

For fucks sake dude. Why would you even fucking type that? - You do realize CCP employees read this subredd?!
---
The rest of your post is nothing really. Rehashed idea that has been posted a million times during the blackout. - But the "PLEX as fuel" thing is possibly the most moronic thing that has been posted on /r/Eve, and that's almost impressive in itself.
---
MJD does. Good luck catching any MJD equipped ratter that knows what they are doing.
---
Either way, if you are ratting with a cloaky in system you accept that risk when you undock. If you don't pay basic attention this is on you. Move to a different system without a cloaky if you want a risk-free experience.
---
Yeah, I know, just adding to 
---
&gt;What can bombers do now that they couldn't do 2 years ago? Nobody was whining about them then.
---
That there were some whines about them all along.
---
So your complaint is that they assembled a better fleet comp than you?
---
Grow a brain, bring some anti-bomb destroyers. If they can bring a mixed comp so can you.
---
Honestly, it's not like an alliance forming a 200 man stutka/goku fleet is subtle. If you're big enough to rorq mine/super rat then you're big enough to have an intelligence division that sees the 20+ "GOKUS UNDER SEDDOW NOW!!!" pings that go out, and prepare accordingly.
---
honestly pve revamped and styled around the triglavian invasion style rats would be awesome
---
The bots live longer.
---
The ignorance is strong with some of these comments.  
---
Here's a fact to blow your mind,   
---
Are you ready?  
---
*Stuka fleets do not rely on "cloaking modules"*  
---
let that sink in for a minute.  
---
Some of the Social Justice Warriors in the thread (and also in game) are crying *"bombers are not stronk, but are OP when there are many of them"*  
---
Do you have any idea what a "*fleet*" is?   
---
I mean *really*?  
---
If there is anything to bitch and moan about Stuka Doctrine, that can be "Why the rest of ships in EVE are not viable for different methods of engagement?"  
---
Which is a matter of Meta/ EVE combat mechanics in general.
---
Keep Eve the same. Don't change nothing. Keep the null faucets. Don't punish bots. When the null alliances get as much isk as they want, they will notice that there's nothing left to spend the money. All pvp players will quit. They will spend the money just to buy capitals and keep farming, just to make EVE a farm game and a video-soup opera, and not the wonderful thrilling game it used to be.
---
That was them being hauled off to be shredded and scrapped
---
It depends on the WH yesterday I found 1 site with around 4-5 relic sites and left 240 mil richer.
---
Adapt, fit scrams on bombers. It's not like Myrms and Domis can lock you fast enough to blap before the cyno goes up.
---
The change only negativitely affects Chori. No one else would run them because of his script.
---
It's not even close to 11 UTC
---
Which... Doesn't strike me as an issue with the bombers, so much as the response plan.
---
I would like to introduce you to our Lord and savior, the warp scrambler
---
Sure they can. Any tackle bomber in scram range should be easily dunkable, *especially* by a drone ship. Also, unless the follow through bombers also come with scrams (and the doctrines we are talking about do not), you can just blap the initial tackle and moonwalk out. Source: have done this many times. 
---
Finally, who gives a flying fuck about Myrms and Domis? Do one site and have it insured, and congrats, you already made more money than you lost.
---
!remindme 1 year
---
Stasis Grappler says hi. Great for killing NPC frigs, too. 
---
What the fuck is this, noob hour? r/evenewbies is this way &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
---
Hehe, thank you!
---
Energy neuts work just fine, as some one who flies booshers in bomber fleets is usually the energy neuts that get me... And I die in probably 80% of the fleets I fly
---
Only since this morning? You are lucky! I got that since 2006.
---
Yet another "magic bullet"  effort to *fix the game.*
---
We practically cannot separate a bot from a normal player. We may think a player "behaves like a bot", and sometimes it is a bot. But we don't have access to his computer we cam't say for sure.
---
*Bonus:* You may think you do. but any day you introduce those "behavior dependent" trig rat spawns, the next day those botters will change the "behavior" of their bots.
---
The guys getting paid to make this game in Iceland may be removed from the rest of the world, they may not play EVE as we do, or they may as well straightforward ignorant bastards, but do not presume they are less intelligent than us.
---
Are you asking why (rhetorically or really curious how the evolution occurred?
---
200, fuck dude. 20 Jackdaws with command dessie and basic logistic support counters any number of bombers.

Git gud. Dirty crabs. Something something bots. Grrrrr CCP.

I stopped trying half way through this post just like everyone else on Reddit.
---
To quality bait and switch have your upvote good sir. (Tips fedora)
---
That's a whole shit ton of meaningless complexity.
---
One side has long as they want to form up and the other has 2-3 minutes. That's a disparity that will never change.
---
[Shitpost station](https://imgur.com/a/CdScywK)
---
correct sir.
---
So we're talking about a combined arms fleet with pilots who have well defined roles to counter the expected resistance and the ships to do them.  That doesn't sound op so much as it's just the right way to draw up a fleet comp.
---
&gt;when your response arrives the bombers just scatter and you kill nothing
---
*cough* siege fleet *cough* no fun allowed *cough*
---
jeveassets claims to do that, though I do not know if it works.
---
adam4eve also claims to, though a friend who's been looking at it suggests it sometimes has false positives, due perhaps to getting garbage info from the market APIs. If that last is really a problem, then likely there is no reliable tool.
---
I don't know the story of why eve central never came back online and funding nay have absolutely nothing to do with it.  
---
But it was a great service and we still have lots of great services run by players. If you have the ability to throw just a dollar at the couple you use the most we could go long way to keeping those things running smoothly into the future.

Uh.........  
---
* Bridge is up, take bridge.  
---
* Everyone lock target and F1 torpedoes.

* Target dead / shit response came - warp off and cloak.

That's a mad lot of skill there for a BB fleet.

F EVE-central was epic.
---
Battleships being utter garbage eliminated them from the meta.
---
they need a nerf because.......
---
*looks at jackdaw murdering them*
---
uhh....
---
*looks at them murdering ferox fleets*
---
.....
---
honestly i have no idea. they seem to be fine to me.   they the small counter to large BC and BBs.      but they get eaten alive by DDs or frigates.
---
take yesterdays fight for instance.  Horde brought ferox and jackdaws.   Goons brought bombers. 
---
feroxes got murdered by the bombers, and jackdaws had a "The Great Marianas Turkey Shoot" of the bombers.
---
counters to counters.
---
my only regret. i wasn't in a confessor. would have killed the bombers faster had i been. (no joke, i was in the middle of their fleet for most of the fight)
---
So, Jita?
---
Star Fox. Sell the Switch, get an N64
---
I mean, it also helps if subs don't get into a tightly packed death ball and then wait for the bombs to roll in.  Put your FC in a monitor and have the subs orbit at range, season the fleet with a few defender launchers and you've mitigated the worst of the bomb damage.
---
TIL greater capitalist competition means decay.

Its called "innovation" when you stick a new set of headlights on a car and sell it the next year as a "new" model.
---
Can't, I'm busy with my spreadsheets.
---
&gt; Either the seller picked up all the items in a firesale or other non-building method and is simply wanting a quick sale, OR the person picked up the raw materials (ore or components) at a huge discount, making their build costs much lower than anyone else can compete with.
---
That's most likely correct.  That's basically how I make all my isk.
---
&gt; Made by former EVE Online developers, this new massively multiplayer RTS wants to imagine a new way to wage space war.

https://www.pcgamer.com/starborne-blends-the-strategy-and-deception-of-eve-online-with-a-4x-strategy-game/
---
So is this how T2 salvage drones will be made?
---
Good write up. Going from raw moon mats to T2 is a bit complicated but it‚Äôs all about different markets, which I think works well. 
---
I bought only advanced materials from Jita and made T2 for years making plenty of profit. However, with refineries and new moon mining, it seems more and more are doing the full chain.
---
I‚Äôve recently updated IPH to handle this as well if anyone is interested: http://eveiph.github.io/
---
Assigned the task to the same person in charge of Eve store.
---
I remember a random wormhole to Jita ... which was supposed to be impossible.

"How many jumps?"

"None.  It's in Jita!"

just because you want it to be true doesnt make it so..
---
This is so not true. I saw plenty of fleet responses in HAC or other subcaps. Munnins, cerbs, feroxes Hawks, etc. Bombers boosh out 100km , boosh back 100 km . launch wave of bombs, boosh out again. HAC fleet dead. Happened many times. Bombers are incredibli effective against subcaps as well.
---
It is. The fins move the the will of the board I designed
---
No, I tried EVE pre-injector as well.
---
I'm sorry, but I have to agree with him.  You're a clown. You act like one all over r/eve.  That's why everyone downvotes you.  Hint: It's not a sign of respect.
---
BUT MUH TITAN KILLMAILS
---
YES
---
So use defender launcher Jackdaws. Besides being fast enough to dodge bombs even with ABs or to flat out ignore them in defense mode, they field defender launchers and project out to 70km. 
---
Include some command dessies of your own and simply stay on top of the other fleet. What the fuck.
---
Do you want fits? I can give you a small scale point defense fleet that will do the job with fits and everything.
---
Both perfectly fine, why do you ask? What part of my comment made you think I was even slightly upset?
---
On paper... PL won!
---
Any idea where it would come from ? It never happened to me, I'm EU btw.
---
IDK how with no t2 stuff for battleships
---
I already have the 128000 version (T2) of that
---
I wanted to do that then reminded myself logging on every two hours to update orders would make me kill myself
---
tried or played ? 
---
Also where you part of a corp or did you just run missions solo (or other solo activity) ? 
---
How much time did you spent trying before you quit ?
---
You want a fleet doctrine and fits? I can do that if you can't figure it out on your own.
---
I've often wondered if the state of PVE is what keeps the retention level low.
---
For someone to have a connection to a world, they need to feel fun and excitement in it, they want a reason and assurance for content when they log on. As things are now, that is not a given.

Missing the Iapetan titans
---
Started WTM fit is like 300m and alpha can fly it, and it uses meta4 guns. Starter fit for TDF is probably cheaper, if using a praxis.
---
&gt;the ignorance is strong with some of these comments
---
OP does not specify fleets my dude. People are giving comments about bombers is solo, small gang and fleets.
---
Okay, what information is that, in this case?  Once you've established that, what would you consider sufficiently obfuscated that it no longer satisfies your definition of "free"?
---
What's the method?  gyro? sun (aka heat seeker)?  Any telemetry or a two-way link?
---
It was already decided that if Goons build one they will also destroy it themselves so they can be the only ones in game to have built and killed one.
---
Now that is an interesting idea :)
---
What ever you think doesn‚Äôt matter.  Most of this reddit is a circlejerk of the most entitled crybabies eve has ever seen

why should you expect to fight succesfully against any fleetcomp or well put together and piloted gang of 5 if you bring headless krabs in kitchen sink garbage?
---
&gt; But the frigates can just fuck off.
---
thats frigs for you. its kinda their thing.

&gt; and still deal &gt;400 DPS
---
when i fight bombers and eat 400 dps/bomber im in the wrong ship for the job at hand.
---
I‚Äôll have to head over thereüòÇ
---
Well generally lethality and elusiveness are supposed to be inversely proportional. Hurty stuff is supposed to hard to get in and out, and sutff that can get in and out easily are supposed to be less hurty. Bombers and supers both take this balance and snap it in half.
---
I‚Äôm not sure what time it is so I just went with the first google result.

Mostly I just wanted to get the ‚Äúit‚Äôs maintenance‚Äù point across.

Thanks anyway though. I think it‚Äôs like 12:00 GMT or something.
---
Yea it's more smaller skirmishes, and you have to put pressure on sov holders which isn't ideal (toasting) it creates the content people are thirsting for.

---
I was buying stuff i looked badly and bought wrong materials for over 2bil.        
---
Because i noted wrongly some parts i also build some of them like 3 thousand to many.       
---
All on 60 recons :D
---
Never not play drunk! :D
---
Wormhole space hasn't changed, my friend, but we all know why null's faucet looks like that.
---
Local is back, in case you did not get the memo.
---
&gt;So, I can see you've used TinyMiner or IsoBox before.
---
i dont know what that is and i dont know why you think ive used them (i guess they are bots?)
---
if id write a bot for eve it would be a trading bot wich i already (legaly) did for crypto markets and maybe a hauler bot
---
There are certain methods most wormholes want to see gone (mjd battleships and Astra farming) but if you widen the metric to say isk/week you'll see where wormhole income is really limited - sites have respawn mechanics that mean you run out and it could be weeks until you get any substantial amount more.
---
Regardless of that, I'd like to see more dread ratters out; because it's more dread ratters to kill.
---
I mean you don't _have_ to keep jobs running all the time. I just update once or twice a day and it's just like nice bonus income.

&gt;Yeah k162 wormholes would not be visible on probe scanner for 4 hours unless someone warped to it from the other side.
---
&gt;Once you've established that, what would you consider sufficiently obfuscated that it no longer satisfies your definition of "free"?
---
In this case, we would need to know CCPs intent. Is it supposed to be this way?
---
It shouldn't take that long to form up, if it does it's time you join a more competent corp/alliance.
---
Methinks you either choose your targets poorly, or don't get just how fast the bombers can burn through their target.
---
Thank god I told that I had one every 15 minutes right ?
---
Before getting into any of that I have to ask up front, are you just looking for something to discredit what I said or not? If that's the intent we can just end this now. I did solo and some corp and i would usually try it with a 3 month sub. Back when subs were the norm I would always give it 3 months to try it. With EVE there are other issues that affect the outcome.
---
tbh I'm already thinking of just walking away again but I have a month left. No, I'm not looking for help. My point was that out of all the mmos I've ever played, EVE is the only one that rewards you for not playing but gives nothing if you do. I find that to be weird.
---
was that the one over a goon station? If so I was in a kirin for goons and saw how feroxes were unable to apply meaning if you broadcast you get saved, but we had to run from the jackdaws because that isn't what the doctrine is designed to fight. I agree that they fit their niche very well.
---
You just described every single one of your posts.  In an oddly specific way too.
---
&gt; complete bullshit on a dick sandwich topped with cheddar 
---
Favorite part of the whole article..
---
&gt; Yeah k162 wormholes would not be visible on probe scanner for 4 hours unless someone warped to it from the other side.
---
That's ... not perfect intel?  In fact, I'd argue that that is rather the opposite of perfect intel, because there's a connection that nobody else knows about.  Those k162 connections are literally unprobeable, if they exist.  (The one way someone might be able to get to one of them is by probing down a drifter that warps to it ... maybe.  Weird things have happened.)  Also, you can crit the hole down to a fraction of a battleship's mass and ignore signatures just as well, if the other end could be found.  That doesn't mean it shouldn't be changed, though.
---
I don't know CCP's mind on this, but my impression is that the intent was for wormholes to usually be opened from the front end by people going through them, rather than for the network to be always findable from both ends, without too much thought having been put into the implications of that.  I wouldn't mind changing it so that the network is much more often fully bidirectional; more connections means it's more likely that you'll stumble across someone, after all, and that's when interesting things happen, even if they don't always happen.
---
Edit: oops; I see you re-quoted that thing.  Leaving original post below for posterity.
---
&gt; Is it supposed to be this way?
---
What's "it", though?  Is "it" the either nonexistent or unprobeable k162 outflows you mentioned 6 posts back? (I'm not entirely clear what's going on here, tbh... there are some odd stories about drifters warping to wormholes that aren't signatures.)  Or is "it" the ability to see all probeable signatures in the probe scanner at all times?  Or, for that matter, is "it" that you can filter the probe scanner to ignore signatures, which allows you to ignore all current signatures and know immediately if a new one shows up because it's the only thing in the list?  Is "it" something else that I missed?
---
Cool, thanks

Haven't seen one of their Revenants in a while.

Not really, because honestly like it's a Reddit argument and while i like fake internet point it's interesting to me because it runs counter to most experience i heard. 
---
Like for me the whole skill system has always been a massive selling point because you unlock things over time rather then repeat a task enough times to get a shiny new thing something that always feels like a pain to do to me ( because it feels like a button pressing contest ). 
---
Eve doesn't reward you for doing most things, because it's not about the result it's about the journey like if you want to enjoy eve your not looking to get results ( read: high amounts of isk biggest ship etc you're journey getting there is the game ). 
---
Sadly and why i think skill injectors and daily SP are so harmful, is because huge parts of the journey get skipped ( and more importantly the people you would climb up the cliff with some offering a hand some kicking you off are getting more and more apart all standing on the top, throwing down rocks out of boredom ), to push a metaphor beyond all believe your turning a competitive cliff climbing simulator into a top of the mountain view simulator, if you insert X dollars.
---
Considering you flashform 20+ titans/supers/caps/fax, you should prolly be able to form jackdaws

I started alone in Providence since they are NRDS, thinking it would be safer than other Nullsec space. Which is kind of true because you're not the one getting hunted down and monitored by intel channels but there is plenty of pvp there, Bubbles on a regular basis  and Gatecamps. (Which neutrals run into because they have no Intel or jump bridges)   
---
The residents get to know you and don't worry about you after a while. In retrospect it would've been better to apply for Brave or Test. I don't know much about the other Nullsec regions.
---
I mean.. it's so hard I can run 7 at the same time in a blops fleet and my only concern is that the last in might not get on a kill. Yea it's real fucking difficult

 Crap this shit dont want send the comment...

Reddit hates me.,.

i don't know, ask to ure corp members 60% of them are GMs and developers from CCP.

And go with TEST.. that go be nice party .

Judging by the average american yearly wage of $59k, 86 yearly wages would buy you approximately 18,060 tons of salt.

This is very clearly a shitpost, your battlestation functions as well as it's form! Good job.

cause i stay on grid for the dread rats white waiting for another person to help kill it, without that small amt of tank itd die. Also i dont like tethering up every few havens

You need a high sec alt.

The former sounds less fun

Thank you so much, awesome thing!

There are a significant number of people building at a loss, simply because they enjoy building stuff.
---
Very prevalent with ships.
---
are you sure you replied to the correct comment?
---
&gt; Since I started doing it again I've noticed it's much, much harder to keep your things at the top.
---
If you need to keep things at the top to sell, then the market is saturated, and you should have noticed that before getting involved with those items.
---
List at a fair price, and it will sell without tending, if the demand is adequate.

Auto downvote for clickbate title

unless null leaders stop the massive circlejerk you can still have fun in wormhole space
---
Praise James.

No big nullsec corp is going to be free of wardecs for any serious length of time. Smaller nullsec groups might slip by. On the other hand, a smaller group is unlikely to be able to afford to spend time on you given your two weeks \~ twice a year play pattern. I'd check out some of the groups up toward Tribute that run NPSI public fleets. They might be happy to have you as a "regular" in their fleets even if you stay in an NPC corp or a vanity corp to avoid wardecs.
---
I do some game server hosting on the side, if you‚Äôre interested I wouldn‚Äôt mind setting you up with a VPS to host this on. I have tons of free resources right now

Chaos era feature I guess.

There's plenty to be found in this thread. Several commenters think this is legit.

It seems CCP is holding back on any major announcements until EVE Vegas.
---
Dont give CCP ideas.

EVE? Not really, but CCP is dying.

Who knew....

What was EVE central
---
My dude, that is a beautiful desk.
---
&gt; the claim is that it's free intel.
---
Thanks for the reminder :)
---
&gt; My understanding is that you are able to "see" when someone warps to the hole indirectly as it then shows up on the probe scanner.
---
Sure, but it could also be that it's been 4 hours since someone rolled the hole and there's nothing there but empty space.  (Would you take the risk? *grin* )
---
Here's an alternate perspective: Wormholes can only be found in the probe scanner.  The only way to warp to them is to either probe them down or to warp to a bookmark that someone else finds.  Before the K162 appears, they might as well *not exist*.  As such, the wormhole only appears either after someone probes it down or the K162 spawn timer ticks over.  (... and I do actually have a lot of thoughts about this. I don't actually run sites, because they bore me to tears, so it'd be definitely better for me to have more targets to catch than to run sites safely.)
---
Currently, this is a fairly high signal-to-noise signal, because you know the state of your own static wormhole, and it is unlikely for any given wormhole to decloak its outlet during a given hour-or-two-long krab session.  There are different risks between putting your static out connection to critical or to roll it away, but you can weigh those and pick one.  Meanwhile, while it is improbable to roll into a particular target system, it is about as plausible that any new connection is going to scout you for a gank as one new red appearing in local in null is trying to tackle someone for his friends.  This is a threat that is generally worth respecting.
---
Putting on my own junior game design hat, we can do a few things to this channel.  One of them is to make it noisier, and another one is to make it less real-time.
---
On the "increasing noise" end, a crit static is not nearly as safe a proposition as rolling it off entirely, assuming someone doesn't have a prober inside the system already to find a way out to let their friends in... which is somewhat of a crapshoot of its own.  The reason the crit static is less safe is, well, it turns out that you can kill a capital just fine if you can bring enough Kikimoras or T3Ds.  (Bombers tend to get shredded by site rats, but they're also a low-mass candidate.)  So, if we put the static respawn time short enough, people would be forced to crit their holes instead of rolling them, because they'll be reaching out before two sites are done.
---
Alternately, one could make the information less real-time, but I don't have an idea which isn't to not show signatures at all, and... I feel like that would do more damage to regular scanning than it would cause trouble for people running sites.  It's not *that* hard to have an alt up with probes spread across the system hitting scan every 10 seconds because you want the sig list, but it would make probing stuff down in the regular course of exploration much more obnoxious, because there you actually need to know where you're probing to.
---
&gt;The ability to outsource mobility infinitely to an external ship is just not balanced.
---
Cynosaural Field Generator would like to have a word with you. Snark aside, I completely agree with your point. 
---
Another thing to consider is this; capital guns are balanced around the concept of players not actually aiming them. Booshing (and Bomb Launchers) is the conceptual opposite.
---
Any goobers can jump their multi million EHP supers and FAX in, but a subcap gang needs an FC. At least that's the case when you've filled your alliance with people who can't PVP and have no desire to learn.
---
i am still stuck at scanning..... i want to play like this
---
Unless they added it recently there is no voiceover in the tutorial.
---
Did the highly required "I'm only pretending to be retarded" clip get added?
---
Removing local was the last step in a series of changes that would have made space more dangerous, but rewarded players willing to work with that danger.  
---
Instead ccp *started* by removing local, then were suprised when it didn't work. Something literally everyone could have predicted in 2 seconds.
---
Now, they've tainted the idea of removing local, something that actually is a clever idea, because they tried to jump the gun instead of doing it properly :/
---
Not really you would have to log in to build your items, now the biggest problem I have with skill injectors is they encourage a mentality that took hold like some point after there introduction and you see it in the community. 
---
Let me try to explain and this is rather hard to explain so let's take manufacturing so let's say my toon has max SP in small ship construction ( about a weeks training if I remember correctly, likely will be disappointed when I roll a new toon for it ), now that gives me the same power in the small ship's market in terms of construction as somebody with a medium and large maxed out as well, so the higher SP player has more options rather than strictly better options.
---
This is good but what you see way more lately is CCP moving in a direction where more SP means flat better, so frig loses to destroyer frig loses to cruiser frig lose to battlecruiser and frig loses to battleship a strictly linear balance, whereas eve would need a more small ships focused meta again to push in new players ( meaning cruiser or battlecruiser need to lose to frigs ), and I don't mean bombers. 
---
The scary thing is because CCP directly benefiting from skill injector prices they have an active incentive to keep the game in a state where more SP is strictly better ( because it will sell more extractors as the demand for injectors go's up ) and this is very much visible in CCP's actions notice how the meta shifted to more SP heavy ships and as long as CCP the company has an economic insensitive to keep a select group of ships strong I don't see a frig meta make a comeback.

This just takes me back - awesome job!  Thank you for your dedication and putting this out there for us to enjoy!

Just have to turn off the in-game music, and play the soundtrack off of Soundcloud. Below the Asteroids on repeat forever yo
---
This picture got me into playing EVE
---
NullSec is a shadow of what it once was and could be, but the other areas are still enjoyable. Especially wormholes. no sov, no ratting index, no umbrella.
---
Has Below the Asteroids. I'm sold.
---
that was the joke...

dear op. i like your desk but you really need a new chair.
---
oh wow what a pretty rig... did you build it yourself?&gt;
---
Do you have proof that it's a script or are you just whining because he was playing the game as it should be instead of blue donut boredom?
---
Because they have the reveal of the next expansion for that.
---
Easier said than done. A passive shield myrm can tank 900dps if built right. You‚Äôd have to alpha something like that to truly get rid of it, and that‚Äôs not something Trigs are equipped for.
---
I find them fun believe it or not.
---
So a dictor for bubbling and a dictor for anti-cloaking?
---
It would make blockade running impossible.
---
This honeatly. Even the new invasion content is decent.
---
My place is a total mess! I've unboxed my new monitor 2 days ago and everything is still layering on the ground everywhere behind me lol.
---
Not to mention cans, batteries, tissues (don't), hard disks, cables and all kind of shit.
---
What you really want is a way to totally lock down your ratting pocket.
---
That's gonna be a no.
---
Delve already gets a shitton of wormholes because everyone rolls for it.
---
Uh.. what?
